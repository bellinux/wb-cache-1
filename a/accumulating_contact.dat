40|$|Many recent {{large-scale}} {{studies of}} interaction networks {{have focused on}} networks of <b>accumulated</b> <b>contacts.</b> In this paper we explore social networks of ongoing relationships {{with an emphasis on}} dynamical aspects. We find a distribution of response times (times between consecutive contacts of different direction between two actors) that has a power-law shape over a large range. We also argue that the distribution of relationship duration (the time between the first and last contacts between actors) is exponentially decaying. Methods to reanalyze the data to compensate for the finite sampling time are proposed. We find that the degree distribution for networks of ongoing contacts fits better to a power-law than the degree distribution of the network of <b>accumulated</b> <b>contacts</b> do. We see that the clustering and assortative mixing coefficients are of the same order for networks of ongoing and <b>accumulated</b> <b>contacts,</b> and that the structural fluctuations of the former are rather large.

However, the exiting studies about promoting information spreading seldom {{took into account}} the human memory, which {{plays an important role}} in the spreading dynamics. In this paper we propose a non-Markovian information spreading model on complex networks, in which every informed node contacts a neighbor by using the memory of neighbor's <b>accumulated</b> <b>contact</b> numbers in the past. We systematically study the information spreading dynamics on uncorrelated configuration networks and a group of $ 22 $ real-world networks, and find an effective contact strategy of promoting information spreading, i. e., the informed nodes preferentially contact neighbors with small number of <b>accumulated</b> <b>contacts.</b> According to the effective contact strategy, the high degree nodes are more likely to be chosen as the contacted neighbors in the early stage of the spreading, while in the late stage of the dynamics, the nodes with small degrees are preferentially contacted. We also propose a mean-field theory to describe our model, which qualitatively agrees well with the stochastic simulations on both artificial and real-world networks.

Given a rigid tool and a deformable environment, we define contact constraints by solving a constrained dynamic simulation problem, typically at a low update rate. A generalized contact Jacobian defines velocities at the constraints given the velocity of the rigid tool. We define an inverse of the contact Jacobian that is dynamically consistent with the constraints and, once we know other forces acting on the rigid tool, it allows a fast update of the <b>accumulated</b> <b>contact</b> forces, and thereby highly transparent rendering. ...|$|R

40|$|Network epidemiology's most {{important}} {{assumption is that}} the contact structure over which infectious diseases propagate can be represented as a static network. However, contacts are highly dynamic, changing at many time scales. In this paper, we investigate conceptually simple methods to construct static graphs for network epidemiology from temporal contact data. We evaluate these methods on empirical and synthetic model data. For almost all our cases, the network representation that captures most relevant information is a so-called exponential-threshold network. In these, each contact contributes with a weight decreasing exponentially with time, {{and there is an}} edge between a pair of vertices if the weight between them exceeds a threshold. Networks of aggregated contacts over an optimally chosen time window perform almost as good as the exponential-threshold networks. On the other hand, networks of <b>accumulated</b> <b>contacts</b> over the entire sampling time, and networks of concurrent partnerships, perform worse.

40|$|ABSTRACT Cadherins are homophilic cell–cell {{adhesion}} molecules {{implicated in}} many funda-mental processes, such as morphogenesis, cell growth, and differentiation. They <b>accumulate</b> at cell–cell <b>contact</b> sites and assemble into large macromolecular complexes named adherens junctions (AJs). Cadherin targeting and function are regulated by various cellular processes, many players of which {{remain to be}} uncovered. Here we identify the small GTPase Rab 35 as a new regulator of cadherin trafficking and stabilization at cell–cell contacts in C 2 C 12 myo-blasts and HeLa cells. We find that Rab 35 <b>accumulates</b> at cell–cell <b>contacts</b> in a cadherin-de-pendent manner. Knockdown of Rab 35 or expression of a dominant-negative form of Rab 35 impaired N- and M-cadherin recruitment to cell–cell contacts, their stabilization at the plasma membrane, and association with p 120 catenin and led to their accumulation in transferrin-, clathrin-, and AP- 2 –positive intracellular vesicles. We also find that Rab 35 function is required for PIP 5 KIγ accumulation at cell–cell contacts and phosphatidyl inositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate pro-duction, which is involved in cadherin stabilization at contact sites. Finally, we show that Rab 35 regulates myoblast fusion, a major cellular process {{under the control of}} cadherin-de-pendent signaling.

Different aquatic arthropods and all major groups of limnetic microorganisms were found embedded in resin that had contact with swamp water. The taphonomy of aquatic organisms differs from that of terrestrial plants and animals that get stuck on resin surfaces and are enclosed by successive resin outflows. Large and highly motile arthropods are predestined for embedding.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of the T cell glycoprotein CD 2 and its ligand CD 58 is important for T cell interaction with antigen-presenting and target cells. The binding interaction is of low affinity and has a fast off-rate (> 5 s- 1) in solution. However, solution measurements may not accurately predict the behavior of molecules in an adhesive contact area. Interaction between T cells that express CD 2 and glass-supported planar bilayers containing purified and fluorescently labeled CD 58 leads to accumulation of CD 58 (fluorescence) in the cell/bilayer contact area. CD 58 molecules <b>accumulated</b> within the <b>contact</b> area {{in excess of the}} CD 58 density in the bilayer outside the contact area can be considered as bound by cell surface CD 2. Here, this phenomena and fluorescence photobleaching recovery were utilized to determine whether CD 2 -CD 58 bonds are transient in contact areas. Fluorescent CD 58 molecules accumulated in the T cell-bilayer interface were completely bleached. The bleached CD 58 molecules <b>accumulated</b> in the <b>contact</b> area were rapidly replaced by fluorescent CD 58 that diffused into the contact area from adjacent bilayer regions outside the contact area. Rapid recovery of the accumulated fluorescence directly demonstrates that the CD 2 -CD 58 bonds are dissociating and that the dissociation leads to partner exchange, rather than rebinding of the same CD 2 -CD 58 pairs. This suggests that the solution off-rate provides an accurate description of CD 2 -CD 58 interaction in <b>contact</b> areas. <b>Accumulated</b> fluorescent IgG in contacts between K 562 cells expressing low affinity Fc receptors and planar bilayers with fluorescent IgG bound to hapten-derivitized phospholipids displayed slower recovery than CD 58 by a factor of 10.

Cellular morphogenesis is driven through the phospholipid-dependent organization at the apical plasma membrane.

MSS- 4 is an essential gene and its deletion resulted in spherically growing cells that ultimately lyse. Two conditional mss- 4 -mutants exhibited altered hyphal morphology and aberrant branching at restrictive conditions that were complemented by expression of wild type MSS- 4. Recombinant MSS- 4 was characterized as a phosphatidylinositolmonophosphate-kinase phosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 4 -phosphate (PtdIns 4 P) to phospha-tidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PtdIns(4, 5) P 2). PtdIns 3 P was also used as a substrate. Sequencing of two conditional mss- 4 alleles identified a single substitution of a highly conserved Y 750 to N. The biochemical characterization of recombinant protein variants revealed Y 750 as critical for PI 4 P 5 -kinase activity of MSS- 4 and of plant PI 4 P 5 -kinases. The conditional growth defects of mss- 4 mutants were caused by severely reduced activity of MSS- 4 (Y 750 N), enabling the formation of only trace amounts of PtdIns(4, 5) P 2.

In astrocytoma U 251 cells not expressing OL-pc, Nap 1 was localized only along the lamellipodia. However, exogenous expression of OL-pc in these cells recruited Nap 1 as well as WAVE 1 to cell–cell contact sites. Although OL-pc expression had no effect on the motility of solitary U 251 cells, it accelerated their movement when they were in contact with one another, causing concomitant reorganization of F-actin and N-cadherin at cell junctions. OL-pc mutants lacking the Nap 1 -binding site exhibited no such effect. N-cadherin knockdown mimicked OL-pc expression in enhancing cell movement.

Here, we show that the dynamic assembly of N-cadherin at cell-cell contacts involves lipid rafts. In C 2 C 12 myoblasts, immunofluorescence and biochemical experiments demonstrate that N-cadherin present at cell-cell contacts is colocalized with lipid rafts. Disruption of lipid rafts leads to the inhibition of {{cell-cell adhesion}} and disorganization of N-cadherin–dependent cell-cell contacts without modifying the association of N-cadherin with catenins and its availability at the plasma membrane. Fluorescent recovery after photobleaching experiments demonstrate that at the dorsal plasma membrane, lipid rafts are not {{directly involved in the}} diffusional mobility of N-cadherin. In contrast, at cell-cell junctions N-cadherin association with lipid rafts allows its stabilization enabling the formation of a functional adhesive complex. We show that lipid rafts, as homophilic interaction and F-actin association, stabilize cadherin-dependent adhesive complexes. Homophilic interactions and F-actin association of N-cadherin are both required for its association to lipid rafts.

Yet the molecular effectors responsible for cadherin accumulation remain incompletely understood.

Myosin 2 is found at cadherin-based cell-cell contacts and its recruitment requires E-cadherin activity. Indeed, both Myosin 2 recruitment and its activation were stimulated by E-cadherin homophilic ligation alone. Inhibition of Myosin 2 activity by blebbistatin or ML- 7 rapidly impaired the ability of cells to concentrate E-cadherin at adhesive contacts, accompanied by decreased cadherin-based cell adhesiveness. The total surface expression of cadherins was unaffected, suggesting that Myosin 2 principally regulates the regional distribution of cadherins at the cell surface. The recruitment of Myosin 2 to cadherin contacts, and its activation, required Rho kinase; furthermore, inhibition of Rho kinase signaling effectively phenocopied the effects of Myosin 2 inhibition. We propose that Myosin 2 is a key effector of Rho-Rho kinase signaling that regulates cell-cell adhesion by determining the ability of cells to concentrate cadherins at contacts in response to homophilic ligation...|$|R

Here, we show that the dynamic assembly of N-cadherin at cell-cell contacts involves lipid rafts. In C 2 C 12 myoblasts, immunofluorescence and biochemical experiments demonstrate that N-cadherin present at cell-cell contacts is colocalized with lipid rafts. Disruption of lipid rafts leads to the inhibition of {{cell-cell adhesion}} and disorganization of N-cadherin-dependent cell-cell contacts without modifying the association of N-cadherin with catenins and its availability at the plasma membrane. Fluorescent recovery after photobleaching experiments demonstrate that at the dorsal plasma membrane, lipid rafts are not {{directly involved in the}} diffusional mobility of N-cadherin. In contrast, at cell-cell junctions N-cadherin association with lipid rafts allows its stabilization enabling the formation of a functional adhesive complex. We show that lipid rafts, as homophilic interaction and F-actin association, stabilize cadherin-dependent adhesive complexes. Homophilic interactions and F-actin association of N-cadherin are both required for its association to lipid rafts. We thus identify lipid rafts as new regulators of cadherin-mediated cell adhesion...|$|R
40|$|Insect {{adhesion}} {{is mediated}} by thin fluid films secreted into the contact zone. As {{the amount of}} fluid affects adhesive forces, a control of secretion appears probable. Here, we quantify {{for the first time}} the rate of fluid secretion in adhesive pads of cockroaches and stick insects. The volume of footprints deposited during consecutive press-downs decreased exponentially and approached a non-zero steady state, demonstrating the presence of a storage volume. We estimated its size and the influx rate into it from a simple compartmental model. Influx was independent of step frequency. Fluid-depleted pads recovered maximal footprint volumes within 15 min. Pads in stationary <b>contact</b> <b>accumulated</b> fluid along the perimeter of the contact zone. The initial fluid build-up slowed down, suggesting that flow is driven by negative Laplace pressure. Freely climbing stick insects left hardly any traceable footprints, suggesting that they save secretion by minimizing contact area or by recovering fluid during detachment. However, even the highest fluid production rates observed incur only small biosynthesis costs, representing less than 1 per cent of the resting metabolic rate. Our results show that fluid secretion in insect wet adhesive systems relies on simple physical principles, allowing for passive control of fluid volume within the contact zone...|$|R
