5|$|As {{part of its}} 1996 Pepsi Stuff {{marketing}} campaign, Pepsi ran {{an advertisement}} promising a Harrier jet to anyone who collected 7,000,000 Pepsi Points, a gag that backfired when a participant attempted {{to take advantage of}} the ability to buy additional points for 10 cents each to claim a jet for US$700,000. When Pepsi turned him down, a lawsuit ensued, in which the judge ruled that <b>any</b> <b>reasonable</b> person would conclude that the advertisement was a joke.|$|E

5|$|The {{common law}} is, however, capable of {{evolving}} {{in the light}} of changing social, economic and cultural developments. Hale's proposition reflected the state of affairs in these respects {{at the time it was}} enunciated. Since then the status of women, and particularly of married women, has changed out of all recognition in various ways which are very familiar and upon which it is unnecessary to go into detail. Apart from property matters and the availability of matrimonial remedies, one of the most important changes is that marriage is in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals, and no longer one in which the wife must be the subservient chattel of the husband. Hale's proposition involves that by marriage a wife gives her irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband under all circumstances and irrespective of the state of her health or how she happens to be feeling at the time. In modern times <b>any</b> <b>reasonable</b> person must regard that conception as quite unacceptable.|$|E

25|$|The term connotes that {{evidence}} establishes a particular {{point to a}} moral certainty which precludes the existence of <b>any</b> <b>reasonable</b> alternatives. It {{does not mean that}} no doubt exists as to the accused's guilt, but only that no reasonable doubt is possible from the evidence presented. Further to this notion of moral certainty, where the trier of fact relies on proof that is solely circumstantial, i.e., when conviction is based entirely on circumstantial evidence, certain jurisdictions specifically require the prosecution's burden of proof to be such that the facts proved must exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable hypothesis or inference other than guilt.|$|E
25|$|The Ba.88 had all {{the design}} {{specifications}} {{to be a very}} effective heavy fighter-bomber. It had a slim, streamlined shape (noted by all aviation observers), a rugged structure, heavy firepower, long range and high speed, with the same horsepower of medium bombers such as the Br.20 (but at 9tonnes/10tons vs. 5tonnes/6tons). Despite its promising beginning, the addition of military equipment in the production series aircraft resulted in high wing loading and detrimental aerodynamic effects with a corresponding loss of performance, below <b>any</b> <b>reasonable</b> level. The contract was subsequently canceled, but production was later resumed, mostly for political reasons to avoid closing production lines of Breda and its satellite company IMAM.|$|E
25|$|For Gebhard, the 1586 Battle of Werl specifically, and {{the sack}} of Westphalia generally, {{provided}} him with no specific gains and with some very concrete losses. Schenck failed to secure <b>any</b> <b>reasonable</b> fortresses for the long-term, which isolated Gebhardt's territories, and his forces, from any possible assistance from the Protestant princes in the east; {{they would have to}} fight through the Spanish army to send him any aid. The assets Schenck did acquire were largely plundered from farmers and merchants. Although they enhanced his and his soldiers' resources, they did little for Gebhard's declining financial situation, which, by this point, was in dire straits. Furthermore, little more than a paid brigand, Schenck alienated the population of Westphalia, if not from Protestantism at least from Gebhard's cause.|$|E

25|$|EF4 (T8-T9) damage {{typically}} {{results in}} a total loss of the affected structure. Well-built homes are reduced to a short pile of medium-sized debris on the foundation. Homes with poor or no anchoring will be swept completely away. Large, heavy vehicles, including airplanes, trains, and large trucks, can be pushed over, flipped repeatedly or picked up and thrown. Large, healthy trees are entirely debarked and snapped off {{close to the ground}} or uprooted altogether and turned into flying projectiles. Passenger cars and similarly sized objects can be picked up and flung for considerable distances. EF4 damage can be expected to level even the most robustly built homes, making the common practice of sheltering in an interior room {{on the ground floor of}} a residence insufficient to ensure survival. A storm shelter, reinforced basement or other subterranean shelter is considered necessary to provide <b>any</b> <b>reasonable</b> expectation of safety against EF4 damage.|$|E
25|$|In 1998 General-Major Radislav Krstić {{was indicted}} for genocide, crimes against {{humanity}} and violations of the laws or customs of war, based on his alleged role in the events {{in and around the}} Bosniak enclave of Srebrenica between 11 July 1995 and 1 November 1995 at the ICTY. On August 2, 2001, after the Trial Chamber was convinced beyond <b>any</b> <b>reasonable</b> doubt that a crime of genocide was committed in Srebrenica, it had convicted Krstić of genocide, who became the first person thus convicted before the Tribunal, and sentenced him to 46 years in prison. The Appeals Chamber had, after upholding the Trial Chamber's finding that Bosnian Serb forces had carried out genocide in Srebrenica, among other things, reduced Krstić’s responsibility for genocide and for the murder of the Bosnian Muslims from that of a direct participant to that of an aider and abettor, and shortened his sentence to 35 years in prison. Krsić was subsequently transferred to the United Kingdom to serve his prison sentence at Wakefield Prison, but was later transferred to Long Lartin Prison.|$|E
25|$|In March 2011, Fisher sued 40,000 {{people who}} they claim {{committed}} copyright infringement. This sparked some {{concern in the}} gay community that many teenagers had downloaded the content and would be outed by the lawsuit. Some had worried that outed gay teenagers would be prone to suicide. Fisher disputed this, saying that in all their legal dealings, none had ever led to a teenage suicide. Initially Fisher offered amnesty to internet users who came forward and admitted they downloaded content illegally. They could settle with Fisher by paying a one time $1000 fee. Fisher described the people who downloaded the content as thieves. The suit also claims that <b>any</b> <b>reasonable</b> internet user would secure their router {{and those who did}} not and allowed content to be downloaded through their IP address were also guilty of copyright infringement. Fisher also sued a Swedish man who wrote a satirical email to them, admitting he had downloaded Fisher's content but told him the money would be paid out of a pot of gold he received from a leprechaun at the end of the rainbow. Fisher sued the man and subpoenaed his Google gmail account information including IP address.|$|E
