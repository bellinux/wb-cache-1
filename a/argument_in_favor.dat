5|$|Another {{important}} <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of dualism is {{that the}} mental and the physical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties. Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not. So, for example, one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like, or what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person. But it is meaningless, or at least odd, to ask what a surge in the uptake of glutamate in the dorsolateral portion of the hippocampus feels like.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{the theory}} that temnospondyls were the {{ancestors}} of all lissamphibians has gained wide support. The skull morphology of some small temnospondyls {{has been compared to}} those of modern frogs and salamanders, but the presence of bicuspid, pedicellate teeth in small, paedomorphic or immature temnospondyls has been cited as the most convincing <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of the temnospondyl origin of lissamphibians. Seen in lissamphibians and many dissorophoid temnospondyls, pedicellate teeth have calcified tips and bases. During the development of most tetrapods, teeth begin to calcify at their tips. Calcification normally proceeds downward {{to the base of the}} tooth, but calcification from the tip stops abruptly in pedicellate teeth. Calcification resumes at the base, leaving an area in the center of the tooth uncalcified. This pattern is seen in living amphibians and fossils.|$|E
5|$|More generally, the Report {{made the}} <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of the {{sovereignty}} of the individual states, for which it is best known. The basic message was that the states were the ultimate parties constituting the federal compact, and that therefore the individual states were ultimate arbiters of whether the compact had been broken by the usurpation of power. This doctrine is known as the compact theory. It was the presence of this argument in the Resolutions that had allowed the Federalists to paint the Democratic-Republicans as leaning toward secession; in the amended Report the line is moderated, with an emphasis that it is the states as political societies of the people (and therefore, one reads in, not the state legislatures alone) which possess this power. Either formulation would help the Democratic-Republican cause by refuting the finality of any constitutional interpretation advanced by the Congress and federal judiciary, both of which were dominated by Federalists.|$|E

25|$|Most Islamic traditions, {{save for}} a few, categorically deny that Jesus {{physically}} died, either on a cross or another manner. The contention is found within the Islamic traditions themselves, with the earliest Hadith reports quoting the companions of Muhammad stating Jesus having died, {{while the majority of}} subsequent Hadith and Tafsir have elaborated an <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of the denial through exegesis and apologetics, becoming the popular (orthodox) view.|$|E
25|$|The Bisbee Deportations {{were later}} {{used by some}} proponents as an <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of {{stronger}} laws against unpopular speech.

25|$|Craig Evans {{states that}} an <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of the partial {{authenticity}} of the Testimonium is that the passage does not exaggerate {{the role played by}} the Jewish leaders in the death of Jesus.

25|$|In {{most western}} democracies, {{the desire to}} {{eliminate}} or reduce economic inequality is generally associated with the political left. One practical <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of reduction {{is the idea that}} economic inequality reduces social cohesion and increases social unrest, thereby weakening the society. There is evidence that this is true (see inequity aversion) and it is intuitive, at least for small face-to-face groups of people. Alberto Alesina, Rafael Di Tella, and Robert MacCulloch find that inequality negatively affects happiness in Europe but not in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{arguments}} for a different author is an <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of attributing this work to the bishop Fulgentius. This theory {{is based on the}} fact that the manuscripts of the Ages of the World attribute the work to “Fabius Claudius Gordianus Fulgentius” (Claudius and Gordianus both being names known to belong to members of the bishop’s immediate family). However, the inclusion of these names in manuscripts was most likely the mistake of some eight or ninth century scribe who assumed ‘Fulgentius’ to be the well-known theologian. It is also possible that Fabius Fulgentius had multiple names (very popular for aristocrats of the time) which included Claudius and Gordianus.|$|E
25|$|David Miller {{has criticized}} {{this kind of}} {{criticism}} by Salmon and others because it makes inductivist assumptions. Popper does not say that corroboration is an indicator of predictive power. The predictive power is in the theory itself, not in its corroboration. The rational motivation for choosing a well-corroborated theory {{is that it is}} simply easier to falsify: Well-corroborated means that at least one kind of experiment (already conducted at least once) could have falsified (but did not actually falsify) the one theory, while the same kind of experiment, regardless of its outcome, could not have falsified the other. So it is rational to choose the well-corroborated theory: It may not be more likely to be true, but if it is actually false, it is easier to get rid of when confronted with the conflicting evidence that will eventually turn up. Accordingly, it is wrong to consider corroboration as a reason, a justification for believing in a theory or as an <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of a theory to convince someone who objects to it.|$|E

500|$|The {{most direct}} {{evidence}} that evolutionary theory is falsifiable {{may be the}} original words of Charles Darwin in chapter 6 of On the Origin of Species: [...] "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which {{could not possibly have}} been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down."

500|$|Finally, the {{successor}} of Djedkare, Unas, {{is thought to}} have been his son in spite of the complete lack of evidence bearing on the question. The main <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of this filiation is that the succession from Djedkare Isesi to Unas seems to have been smooth, as suggested indirectly, for example, by the Abusir papyri. Indirect evidence also comes from the reliefs of Unas' causeway, which show many officials bearing names incorporating [...] "Isesi", suggesting at the very least that Unas did not perceive Djedkare as an antagonist.|$|E
500|$|Based on archaeological evidence, {{several men}} have been {{suggested}} by historians as Zenobia's father: Julius Aurelius Zenobius appears on a Palmyrene inscription as a strategos of Palmyra in 231–232; based on the similarity of the names, Zenobius was suggested as Zenobia's father by the numismatist [...] and others. Another <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of Zenobius' identification as the father is that his statue was opposite that of the queen on the Great Colonnade. However, the only gentilicium appearing on Zenobia's inscriptions was [...] "Septimia" [...] (not [...] "Julia Aurelia", which she would have borne if her father's gentilicium was Aurelius), and it cannot be proven that the queen changed her gentilicium to Septimia after her marriage.|$|E

500|$|Opposition to {{the plan}} was {{widespread}} within Congress. Critics pointed out {{that many of the}} original problems remained in both areas of performance and expense. In particular it seemed the B-52 fitted with electronics similar to the B-1B would be equally able to avoid interception, as the speed advantage of the B-1 was now minimal. It also appeared that the [...] "interim" [...] time frame served by the B-1B would be less than a decade, being rendered obsolete shortly after the introduction of a much more capable ATB design. The primary <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of the B-1 was its large conventional weapon payload, and that its takeoff performance allowed it to operate with a credible bomb load from a much wider variety of airfields. The USAF spread production subcontracts across many congressional districts, making the aircraft more popular on Capitol Hill.|$|E
500|$|However, the {{expansion}} of the definition of the Nanking Massacre to include areas outside of Nanking has not been without controversy. The <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of this made by Katsuichi Honda in 1984 was seen by some scholars involved in the debate on the massacre as a [...] "partial admission of defeat" [...] by Honda. In their view Honda, who had previously put forward the idea that more than 100,000 people were murdered in the city of Nanking alone, was failing to prove his argument and therefore sought to extend the boundaries of the massacre until a larger figure for the death toll could be achieved. French historian Jean-Louis Margolin, for instance, has strongly criticized Honda's argument, noting that [...] "As, in our present knowledge, it is impossible to get convincing figures for such large areas, such methods may be considered as attempts to blur hopelessly the debate." ...|$|E
500|$|Some classifier-noun pairings are arbitrary, or {{at least}} appear to modern {{speakers}} to have no semantic motivation. For instance, the classifier bù {{may be used for}} movies and novels, but also for cars and telephones. Some of this arbitrariness may be due to what linguist James Tai refers to as [...] "fossilization", whereby a count-classifier loses its meaning through historical changes but remains paired with some nouns. For example, the classifier pǐ used for horses is meaningless today, but in Classical Chinese may have referred to a [...] "team of two horses", a pair of horse skeletons, or the pairing between man and horse. Arbitrariness may also arise when a classifier is borrowed, along with its noun, from a dialect in which it has a clear meaning to one in which it does not. In both these cases, the use of the classifier is remembered more by association with certain [...] "prototypical" [...] nouns (such as horse) rather than by understanding of semantic categories, and thus arbitrariness has been used as an <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of the prototype theory of classifiers. Gao and Malt propose that both the category and prototype theories are correct: in their conception, some classifiers constitute [...] "well-defined categories", others make [...] "prototype categories", and still others are relatively arbitrary.|$|E

500|$|The Law of the Sea is the {{particular}} body international law applied to maritime questions and offenses. Empires such as Rome and China long claimed universal jurisdiction; during the Middle Ages, Italian maritime republics such as Venice and Genoa recognized {{the existence of}} rival states but claimed the right to close the seas to their traffic. Portuguese and Spanish pursuit of similar rights over new seas and lands during the Age of Discovery and papal support of their claims {{was a factor in}} the Wars of Religion; in 1609, a jurist hired to defend a lucrative act of piracy by the Dutch East India Company penned Mare Liberum, an <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of freedom of the seas that ultimately produced the compromise that territory extended as far as land-based cannonshot could reach, standardized to 3 nautical miles (...) , and that everything beyond was international waters. President Woodrow Wilson argued this principle as part of United States's entrance into World War I and as one of his Fourteen Points afterwards; nonetheless, President Truman's unilateral claim of jurisdiction over the oil reserves of America's continental shelf in 1945 directly led {{to the end of the}} regime. The three rounds of the United Nations' conferences on the Law of the Sea eventually reshaped international maritime law but the United States has not ratified the present treaty but instead adopted its policies piecemeal via presidential proclamations.|$|E
500|$|Allegra was {{the product}} of a {{short-lived}} affair between the Romantic poet and her starstruck teenage mother, who was living in reduced circumstances in the household of her stepsister and brother-in-law. Clairmont wrote to Byron during the pregnancy begging him to write back and promise {{to take care of her}} and the baby; however, Byron ignored her pleas. After her birth, she was initially taken into the household of Leigh Hunt as the child of a cousin. A few months later the Shelleys and Clairmont took the baby back as an [...] "adopted" [...] child. Clairmont bonded with her baby daughter and wrote in her journal with delight about her close, physical connection with little Allegra, but she was also dealing with emotional and financial pressures from the Shelleys that made it difficult for her to keep the baby with her. The Shelleys were fond of Allegra, but Mary Shelley feared that neighbours would believe Percy Bysshe Shelley had fathered her as the truth about her relationship to Clairmont leaked out. William Godwin, Mary's father and Clairmont's stepfather, had immediately leaped to that conclusion when he learned of Allegra's birth. In an October 1817 letter to Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Shelley remarked that their toddler son William disliked Allegra, but was fond of his baby sister Clara. She saw her son's reaction to Allegra, who was no blood relation to him, as [...] "an <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of those who advocate instinctive natural affection". In addition, the Shelleys were constantly in debt and Mary Shelley wanted the baby to be sent to Byron and wanted her difficult and temperamental stepsister, who had too close a relationship with her husband, to leave her house.|$|E
