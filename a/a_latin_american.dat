5|$|Closer to home, Cleveland {{adopted a}} broad {{interpretation}} of the Monroe Doctrine that not only prohibited new European colonies, but also declared an American national interest in any matter of substance within the hemisphere. When Britain and Venezuela disagreed over the boundary between Venezuela and the colony of British Guiana, Cleveland and Secretary of State Richard Olney protested. British Prime Minister Lord Salisbury and the British ambassador to Washington, Julian Pauncefote, misjudged how important successful resolution of the dispute was to the American government, having prolonged the crisis before ultimately accepting the American demand for arbitration. A tribunal convened in Paris in 1898 to decide the matter, and in 1899 awarded {{the bulk of the}} disputed territory to British Guiana. But by standing with <b>a</b> <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> nation against the encroachment of a colonial power, Cleveland improved relations with the United States' southern neighbors, and at the same time, the cordial manner in which the negotiations were conducted also made for good relations with Britain.|$|E

Unlike the premier football tournament forementioned, the competition uses a single, main sponsor; it is currently primarily sponsored by Banco Santander, one of the largest banks in the world. The deal running for a period of three years began with the 2012 edition. As the main sponsor of the tournament, the competition will carry the name of the bank. Thus, the competition is known officially as the '"Copa Santander Libertadores'". The first primary sponsor of the competition was Fox Sports Latinoamérica, <b>a</b> <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> cable television network focusing on sports-related programming including live and pre-recorded event telecasts, sports talk shows, and other original programmings. The sponsorship was only for the 2005 edition of the competition, being known officially as '"Fox Sports Recopa Sudamericana"'. The second primary sponsor was Visa, an American multinational financial services corporation. The deal ran for a period of 3 years which began with the 2006 edition. As the main sponsor of the tournament, the competition carried the name of the corporation. Thus, the competition was known officially as '"Recopa Visa Sudamericana"'.|$|E

5|$|To be {{considered}} a dictator novel, a story should have strong political themes drawn from history, a critical examination of the power held by the dictator, the caudillo, and some general reflection {{on the nature of}} authoritarianism. Although some dictator novels centre on one historical dictator (albeit in fictional guise), they do not analyze the economics, politics, and rule of the régime as might a history book. The dictator novel genre includes I, the Supreme (1974), by Augusto Roa Bastos, about Dr. Francia of Paraguay, and The Feast of the Goat (2000), by Mario Vargas Llosa, about Rafael Leónidas Trujillo of the Dominican Republic. Alternatively, the novelist might create a fictional dictator to achieve the same narrative end, as in Reasons of State (1974), by Alejo Carpentier, in which the dictator is a composite man assembled from historical dictators. The genre of the dictator novel has been very influential in the development of <b>a</b> <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> literary tradition, because many of the novelists rejected traditional, linear story-telling techniques, and developed narrative styles that blurred the distinctions between reader, narrator, plot, characters, and story. In examining the authority of leadership, the novelists also assessed their own social roles as paternalistic dispensers of wisdom, like that of the caudillo whose régime they challenged in their dictator novels.|$|E

25|$|In the Latin American {{literature}} of the late 1960s, from the fictional place-name Macondo — the rural locale of the novel One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967), by Gabriel García Márquez — derived the terms Macondismo and Macondo, which denoted a magical realist literary movement, a narrative mode, and a literary genre. In time, the popularity of stories occurred in rural Macondo began to creatively limit Latin American writers who wrote about urban life in the Latin American city. To free themselves from the creative limitations imposed by the literary and financial success of the Latin American Boom and Macondismo, the McOndo writers reneged the Latin American Boom, and denounced el Realismo mágico (Magical Realism) as a cultural caricature; and, in counter-reaction, the McOndos published literature that realistically presented the experiences of being <b>a</b> <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> man and <b>a</b> <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> woman in an urban-suburban world that is culturally dominated by the popular culture of the United States.|$|E
