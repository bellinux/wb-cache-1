5|$|During her directorship, Cosima opposed {{theatrical}} innovations and adhered {{closely to}} Wagner's original productions of his works, an approach continued by her successors long after her retirement in 1907.

This was {{a defining feature of}} Bayreuth for decades, into the Nazi era which closely followed {{her death in}} 1930.

5|$|Initially {{the camps}} housed {{political}} opponents; over time, undesirable members of German society—criminals, vagrants, deviants—were {{placed in the}} camps as well. A Hitler decree issued in December 1937 allowed for the incarceration of anyone deemed by the regime to be an undesirable member of society. This included Jews, Gypsies, communists, and those persons of any other cultural, racial, political, or religious affiliation deemed by the Nazis to be Untermensch (sub-human). Thus, the camps became a mechanism for social <b>and</b> <b>racial</b> engineering. By the outbreak of World War II in autumn 1939, there were six camps housing some 27,000 inmates.

5|$|The 1903 {{revision}} of the Westminster Confession eventually led {{a large number of}} congregations from the Arminian–leaning Cumberland Presbyterian Church to reunite with the PCUSA in 1906. While overwhelmingly approved, the reunion caused controversy within the PCUSA due to concerns over doctrinal compatibility <b>and</b> <b>racial</b> segregation in the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. Warfield was a strong critic of the merger on doctrinal grounds. Northern Presbyterians, such as Francis James Grimké and Herrick Johnson, objected to the creation of racially segregated presbyteries in the South, a concession demanded by the Cumberland Presbyterians as the price for reunion. Despite these objections, the merger was overwhelmingly approved.|$|E
