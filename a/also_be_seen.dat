5|$|The play can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as a {{predecessor}} to the exaggerated emotionalism {{of later}} American drama, {{and as an}} early example of how background music would be used in more modern American drama and films.|$|E

More whales have been observed close to shore along with fin whales.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{theory can}} <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> {{at play in}} Stowe's book, with the novel as a {{critique}} of the patriarchal nature of slavery. For Stowe, blood relations rather than paternalistic relations between masters and slaves formed the basis of families. Moreover, Stowe viewed national solidarity as an extension of a person's family, thus feelings of nationality stemmed from possessing a shared race. Consequently, she advocated African colonization for freed slaves and not amalgamation into American society.|$|E

Plain white or grey coats can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen,</b> but these would be {{considered}} to be a serious fault for the purposes of conformation shows. However, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi has no specific disqualification criteria present in the breed standard.|$|E

5|$|It can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> however {{that this}} simple 2-dimensional model, {{essentially}} an inverted pendulum on a turntable, {{predicts that the}} steady-state turn is unstable. If the bike is displaced slightly downwards from its equilibrium lean angle, the torque of gravity increases, that of centrifugal force decreases and the displacement gets amplified. A more-sophisticated model that allows a wheel to steer, adjust the path, and counter the torque of gravity, is necessary to capture the self-stability observed in real bikes.|$|E
5|$|Josh Weinstein {{has said}} {{that there are so many}} sleazy {{characters}} in The Simpsons that it was easy to find people for the scenes in the burlesque house. A character modeled after John Swartzwelder can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen.</b> Belle was not modeled after anyone in particular and she was redesigned several times. Belle was voiced by Tress MacNeille but there had been previous efforts to cast a guest voice for the role.|$|E

The narrow leat which once diverted water from Brownrigg Well into the gill beside the mine may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen,</b> much higher up the fellside.|$|E
