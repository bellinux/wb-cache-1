40|$|Aluminium tubular {{structural}} members may experience web crippling failure due to localize concentrated loads or reactions. This paper reports an experimental program on strengthening of high strength aluminium tubular {{structural members}} using externally bonded carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP). A {{series of tests}} on CFRP strengthened aluminium square and rectangular hollow sections subjected to web crippling are presented. The web crippling tests were conducted under two loading conditions of End-Two-Flange (ETF) and End-One-Flange (EOF). A total of 27 web crippling tests were conducted in this study. The investigation was mainly focused {{on the effects of}} web slenderness of <b>aluminium</b> tubular <b>sections</b> on CFRP strengthening against web crippling. The tests were performed on eight different sizes of square and rectangular hollow sections which covered a wide range of slenderness (flat portion of web depth-to-thickness) ratio from 6. 2 to 61. 8. Material properties of each <b>aluminium</b> <b>section</b> were obtained from tensile coupon tests. Most of the strengthened specimens were failed by debonding of CFRP plate from the aluminium tubes. Three main failure modes were observed in the tests, namely the adhesion, combination of adhesion and cohesion, and interlaminar failure of CFRP plate. The failure modes and the load-web deformation behaviour of the <b>aluminium</b> <b>sections</b> are also presented. It was found that the web crippling capacity of <b>aluminium</b> <b>sections</b> are significantly increased due to CFRP strengthening, especially for those sections with higher web slenderness ratio. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 7 th International Conference on Steel and Aluminium Structures (ICSAS 2011), Sarawak, Malaysia, 13 - 15 July 2011.

Continued engine development, in response to Alfa Romeo's post-war introduction of two-stage supercharging, began to expose weaknesses in the chassis design. In an attempt to improve torsional rigidity Maserati began to experiment with tubular <b>section</b> <b>chassis</b> members.

40|$|Extruded <b>aluminium</b> <b>sections</b> {{have many}} {{features}} that make them suitable for use in environment-friendly products. Still there are {{much to be done}} to reduce the variability of section properties and to optimize the processing route from extruded section to finished and assembled component in order to meet cost, quality and performance goals, minimizing adverse environmental impacts and maximizing the conservation of valuable resources. Another important question taken up in this paper, however, is the problem of ensuring that <b>aluminium</b> <b>sections</b> are used in products and technical systems that are contributing to a sustainable development during their total life cycle. In order to ensure this, it is claimed that the it is necessary to carry out a product system diagnosis that combine ecological and competetive considerations. Further one has to promote design for environment that ensures functionality completely fitting into sustainable societies and innovatins based on a multidisciplinary approach, searching for synthesis of technology, the arts and the humanistic disciplines. The universities should take active part in this process, by creating new areas of competence and establish new alliances with the industry and the society. </p...|$|R

The chassis plate, mounted on the bulkhead above the brake master cylinder, was the printed SE328 type but with 'T60' stamped in the chassis number block along with the chassis number. Chassis numbers run from 1 to approximately 1800. The first 600 cars (approximately) had a bench seat with an umbrella-type pull handbrake and <b>aluminium</b> reinforcement <b>sections</b> in the punt body section.

The 1976 prototype car featured a turbocharged Rover V8 engine. A version with a turbocharged Saab engine was also mooted, but none was built. The suspension came from the Triumph 2500 and the gearbox was a ZF 5-speed unit. By undoing 10 bolts, the entire rear end, suspension, gearbox and engine came away.|$|R
25|$|Most modern domes {{are built}} from thin <b>aluminium</b> <b>sections</b> with ribs {{providing}} a supporting structure behind. The use of aluminium {{makes it easy}} to perforate the dome with thousands of tiny holes. This reduces the reflectivity of sound back to the audience (providing better acoustic characteristics), lets a sound system project through the dome from behind (offering sound that seems to come from appropriate directions related to a show), and allows air circulation through the projection surface for climate control.|$|R

A compressed air starter was fitted. The steel <b>section</b> <b>chassis</b> had half elliptic leaf springs all round. The brakes followed the convention of the time, with the hand lever operating the rear drums and the foot pedal a transmission brake. Even though the cars were right hand drive, the gear change lever was on the driver's right side, as was the custom at the time. The car was distinguished by a sharply V-shaped radiator.|$|R

40|$|All {{the loads}} {{generated}} by other components of heavy vehicle are transferred to its chassis. Chassis related failures are few but the damages {{to the safety}} of occupant are huge; sometimes it leads to fatal accidents. In order to overcome this, the chassis has to be optimized based on static and dynamic loads by ensuring a uniform distribution of stress and strain. The shape and cross <b>section</b> of the <b>chassis</b> gives a resistance to the above mentioned loads. The cross <b>section</b> of the <b>chassis</b> structure of all on-road vehicles is uniform despite the variable loads. In this work, variable cross <b>section</b> <b>chassis</b> of an on-road heavy vehicle is designed by keeping optimum sections. Bending moment of the chassis has been mathematically related with section modulus of the chassis. Genetic algorithm based procedures have been used to optimize the height, width and thickness of the <b>chassis</b> cross <b>section.</b> Coding in C language is used to automate the genetic algorithm procedures. For benchmark study, 3 D models of optimized and existing chassis of an on-road heavy vehicle were developed. Finite element analysis reveals that the optimized chassis has less failure possibilities due to lower stress values and uniform distribution when compared to those from the model of existing chassis...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a test programme on aluminium tubular structural members that have experienced web crippling failure due to localized concentrated loads or reactions. A {{series of tests}} was performed on fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) strengthening of aluminium tubular structural members subjected to End-Two-Flange and Interior-Two-Flange loading conditions. A total of 58 web crippling tests was conducted. The investigation was mainly focused {{on the effects of}} different adhesive and FRP for strengthening of <b>aluminium</b> tubular <b>sections</b> against web crippling. The influence of different widths of FRP plate strengthening against web crippling has been also investigated in this study. The test specimens consisted of 6061 -T 6 heat-treated aluminium alloy square and rectangular hollow sections. Six different adhesives and six different FRPs were considered in this study. The properties of adhesive and FRP have significant influence on the effectiveness of the strengthening. Most of the strengthened specimens were failed by debonding of FRP plates from the aluminium tubes. There are mainly four different failure modes observed in the tests, namely the adhesion, cohesion, combination of adhesion and cohesion, and interlaminar failure of FRP plate. The failure loads, failure modes, and the load-web deformation behaviour of the <b>aluminium</b> <b>sections</b> are presented in this study. It was found that the web crippling capacity of <b>aluminium</b> tubular <b>sections</b> is significantly increased due to FRP strengthening, especially for those sections with large value of web slenderness ratio. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|The channel <b>section</b> <b>chassis</b> had {{suspension}} by {{leaf springs}} {{at the front}} and a mix of leaf springs and torsion bars at the rear. At the front semi-elliptical springs were used with radius arms controlling fore and aft movement of the axle. The radius arms were joined by a torsion bar {{across the front of}} the chassis to act as an anti-roll bar. At the rear the quarter-elliptical springs had their front ends mounted in a boss that was attached to a short transverse torsion bar which controlled the rotation of the boss making the suspension a hybrid arrangement. As at the front linked radius rods provided axle location and anti-roll properties.|$|R
50|$|A {{lattice tower}} is a {{framework}} construction {{made of steel}} or <b>aluminium</b> <b>sections.</b> Lattice towers are used for power lines of all voltages, and {{are the most common}} type for high-voltage transmission lines. Lattice towers are usually made of galvanized steel. Aluminium is used for reduced weight, such as in mountainous areas where structures are placed by helicopter. Aluminium is also used in environments that would be corrosive to steel. The extra material cost of aluminium towers will be offset by lower installation cost. Design of aluminium lattice towers is similar to that for steel, but must take into account aluminium's lower Young's modulus.|$|R
30|$|In fact, such dynamic {{behaviours}} of extruded <b>aluminium</b> <b>section</b> {{is typical}} for stiffened panel structures, {{for which the}} dynamic response from a point load is global and uniform at low frequencies and tends to localize at higher frequencies where the point mobility increases substantially. Because {{of the differences in}} dominant vibro-acoustic characteristics at different frequency ranges for stiffened panel structures, different vibration and acoustic modelling approaches should be applied accordingly. In principle, the choice for appropriate techniques should follow the two criteria below: (1) the adopted technique should be able to effectively reflect the critical design changes for the vibro-acoustic performance of the product, and (2) the predicting procedure should be computationally robust and efficient.|$|R
