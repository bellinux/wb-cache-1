25|$|In {{order to}} grind {{telescope}} optics into an accurate shape, a highly versatile material {{must be used}} such as glass. The amateur casting process is usually done through a temperature controlled glass fusing kiln, in which layers or chunks of glass (usually plate or borosilicate glass) are stacked on top of or around each other within a round mold specified to aperture size. After the melting point is reached, the glass fuses together and then the <b>annealing</b> <b>process</b> begins. Proper annealing procedures ensure that internal stresses are relieved within the glass, which reduces risk of failure for the newly cast blank.|$|E
25|$|Presently {{diamonds}} are safely irradiated in four ways: proton and deuteron bombardment via cyclotrons; {{gamma ray}} bombardment via exposure to cobalt-60; neutron bombardment via {{the piles of}} nuclear reactors; and electron bombardment via Van de Graaff generators. These high-energy particles physically alter the diamond's crystal lattice, knocking carbon atoms out of place and producing color centers. Irradiated diamonds are all some shade of green, black, or blue after treatment, but most are annealed to further modify their color into bright shades of yellow, orange, brown, or pink. The <b>annealing</b> <b>process</b> increases the mobility of individual carbon atoms, allowing some of the lattice defects created during irradiation to be corrected. The final color {{is dependent on the}} diamond's composition and the temperature and length of annealing.|$|E

Historically, lead has been widely believed to mitigate the formation of tin whiskers, though the precise mechanism for this is unknown.

2500|$|During the [...] <b>annealing</b> <b>process</b> of die making, {{two main}} errors can occur, {{resulting}} {{in less than}} perfect dies. It is impossible to tell without expensive and lengthy tests whether these errors occurred, but they will lead to significantly weaker dies and a higher tendency to deteriorate quickly. The first thing which can happen to a die in this process what metallurgists call decarburization. Decarburization {{is the result of}} an improper mix of metals and chemicals in the annealing furnace where the dies are sent to soften. If there is not enough ambient carbon in the furnace, the steel will give up some of its carbon and will become soft. The result is a thin surface of inadequate metal whose chemical composition has been altered and is below standard.|$|E

2500|$|Annealing brass {{to make it}} softer {{and less}} brittle is fairly easy, but {{annealing}} cartridge cases is a more complex matter. Since {{the base of the}} case must be hard, it cannot be annealed. What is needed is a form of heat treatment called differential hardening, where heat is carefully applied to part of the case until the desired softness is reached, and then the heat treatment process is halted by rapidly cooling the case. [...] Since annealing brass requires heating it to about 660°F (350°C), the heating must be done {{in such a way as}} to heat the neck to that temperature, while preventing the base of the case from being heated and losing its hardness. The traditional way is to stand the cases in a shallow pan full of water, then heat the necks of the cases with a torch, but this method makes it difficult to get an even heating of the entire case neck. A temperature-sensitive crayon can be used at the point to which it is to be annealed, which is just behind the shoulder for bottlenecked cartridges, or at the bottom of the bullet seating depth for straight-wall cartridges. The neck of the case is placed in a propane torch flame and heated it until the crayon mark changes color, indicating the correct temperature. Once the correct temperature is reached the case is completely quenched in water to stop the <b>annealing</b> <b>process</b> at the desired hardness. [...] Failing to keep the base of the case cool can anneal the case near the head, where it must remain hard to function properly. [...] Another approach is to immerse the case mouth in a molten alloy of lead that is at the desired annealing temperature for a few seconds, then quickly shake off the lead and quench the case.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} projhect is {{to study}} the {{electronic}} properties of organic (carbon-based) semiconductor materials and to study electronic devices, such as FETs, made using these materials. Organic semiconductors offer a number of advantages including ease and low-cost of device fabrication and chemical versatility. While irganic display technologies and light emitting devices are currently on the market, organic transistors are still and active area of scientific research, particularly for applications requiring higher electrical mobility to enable faster switching. My research was focused on triethylsilylethynyl-anthradithiophene (TES-ADT), a small molecule organic semiconductor. TES-ADT can be dissolved in toluene and spin-cated onto pre-fabricated FET structures on a degenerately-doped silicon substrate, which is used as the gate. A 400 nm thick thermally grown oxide is used to insulate the semiconductor gate from the Ti/Au source and drain leads. The as-deposited TES-ADT film is amorphous, and recent work by the Anthony group at the University of Kentucky has shown that this film can be crystallised by exposure toa solvent vapour, typically dichloroethane, leading to substantially imporved electrical characteristics of the TES-ADT FET and mobilities up to 1. 5 * 10 ^- 1 cm^ 2 /Vs. In this thesis, I report research on an alternative route to crystallising TES-ADT films, namely a thermal <b>anneal</b> <b>process.</b> It involves heating the film to a temperature between 70 to 130 degrees (C), but less than the melting point of 154 degrees (C), obviating {{the need for the}} solvent <b>anneal</b> <b>process.</b> FET characteristics are obtained, with mobilities up to 4. 72 * 10 ^- 3 cm^ 2 /Vs that are comparable to those obtained via the solvent <b>anneal</b> <b>process</b> and those obtained with other organic materials.

To address these new process control requirements, in 2007, Xitronix Corporation introduced a photo-reflectance system to the semiconductor process control market.

However, the probe beam of the Xitronix system had a wavelength of approximately 375 nanometers, near the first major interband transition in silicon. At this wavelength the electro-modulation signal is dominant, which enabled the Xitronix system to precisely measure active doping concentration in diffusion-less <b>annealing</b> <b>processes.</b> This probe beam wavelength also provided excellent sensitivity to strain in strained silicon processes.|$|R
50|$|Preparation of {{the modern}} {{planchet}} involves several steps. First, the metal (or metals {{in the case of}} clad or multilayered coins) is rolled out into a large roll or sheet of the correct thickness. This process is often done by third parties, not by the mint itself. These flat rolls or sheets of metal are then punched out into round blanks that are a little larger than the coin being struck. The blanks are then subjected to an <b>annealing</b> <b>process</b> that softens the metal through heating to approximately 750 degrees Celsius (1400 degrees Fahrenheit) and are then slowly air cooled. They are then washed to remove residue from the <b>annealing</b> <b>process</b> and dried. The blanks then go through an upsetting mill that raises the rim {{on the edge of the}} coin.|$|E
