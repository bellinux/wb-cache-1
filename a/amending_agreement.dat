25|$|The {{proposal}} {{to link the}} airport with a bridge had been previously approved by Toronto City Council in 1995 and 1998, {{with the proviso that}} a business plan would be presented for approval by the THC and later the TPA for operating the airport. In November 2002, City Council met to debate the competing proposals, that of closing the airport in favour of some parkland, or of approving the TPA's plans and having uncontested title to the port lands. Despite pleas from former mayor David Crombie, urban planner/activist Jane Jacobs and Harbourfront residents, the TPA plan was supported by then-mayor Mel Lastman, who argued that the estimated $190 million of annual economic benefit the airport would create, was too good to pass up. On November 28, 2002, Council in a day-long debate, made two votes to settle the issue. First, Council voted 32–9 to accept a settlement to end the TPA port-lands lawsuit in exchange for an immediate payment of $5.5 million and an annual subsidy of $5.5 million to the TPA until 2012. Council then voted 29–11 to approve the amendment of the tripartite agreement to permit a fixed link and the construction of a lift bridge and the City, the Federal Government and the TPA signed and delivered such <b>amending</b> <b>agreement</b> dated June 26, 2003.|$|E

40|$|A central {{institution}} of US trade policy is Fast-Track Authority (FTA), by which Congress commits not to <b>amend</b> a trade <b>agreement</b> that {{is presented to}} it for ratification, but to subject the agreement to an up-or-down vote.

If the US government negotiates a trade agreement {{with the government of}} a smaller economy, as the negotiations proceed, businesses in the partner economy, anticipating the opening of the US market to their goods, may make sunk investments {{to take advantage of the}} US market, such as quality upgrades to meet the expectations of the demanding US consumer. As a result, when the time comes for ratification of the agreement, the partner economy will be locked in to the US market in a way it was not previously. At this point, if Congress is able to <b>amend</b> the <b>agreement,</b> the partner country has less bargaining power than it did ex ante, and so Congress can make changes that are adverse to the partner. As a result, if the US wants to convince such a partner country to negotiate a trade deal, it must first commit not to <b>amend</b> the <b>agreement</b> ex post. In this situation, FTA is Pareto-improving...|$|R
