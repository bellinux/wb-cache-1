5|$|Based on the star's chromospheric activity, HD 28185 is {{estimated}} to have <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> around 2,900 million years. On the other hand, evolutionary models give <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> around 7,500 million years and a mass 0.99 times that of our Sun. The higher luminosity and longer rotation period favour an older age for the star.|$|E
5|$|Cuban iguanas reach sexual {{maturity}} at <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> {{two to three}} years. Males are gregarious when immature, but become more aggressive as they age, vigorously defending territories in competition for females. Females are more tolerant of each other, except after laying their eggs.|$|E

5|$|A {{long-lived}} plant reaching <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> up to 60 years, I.anemonifolius resprouts {{from its}} woody base, {{known as a}} lignotuber, after bushfire. Seedlings appear in the year following a fire. Although I.anemonifolius was collected by Daniel Solander in 1770, it was not described until 1796 by Richard Salisbury. Several varieties have been named, though none are now recognised as distinct. It was first cultivated in the United Kingdom in 1791. I.anemonifolius grows readily in the garden if located in a sunny or part-shaded spot with sandy soil and good drainage.|$|E

5|$|A {{still more}} {{resonant}} {{aspect of his}} legacy was the uniform rewriting of Roman law, the Corpus Juris Civilis, which is still the basis of civil law in many modern states.

5|$|After Cao's {{defeat at}} the naval Battle of Red Cliffs in 208 AD, China was divided into three spheres of influence, with Cao Cao {{dominating}} the north, Sun Quan (182–252 AD) dominating the south, and Liu Bei (161–223 AD) dominating the west. Cao Cao died in March 220 AD. By December his son Cao Pi (187–226 AD) had Emperor Xian relinquish the throne to him and is known posthumously as Emperor Wen of Wei. This formally ended the Han dynasty and initiated <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> conflict between three states: Cao Wei, Eastern Wu, and Shu Han.|$|E
5|$|Another way of {{estimating}} {{the age of}} the cluster is by looking at the lowest-mass objects. In normal main-sequence stars, lithium is rapidly destroyed in nuclear fusion reactions. Brown dwarfs can retain their lithium, however. Due to lithium's very low ignition temperature of 2.5 × 106 K, the highest-mass brown dwarfs will burn it eventually, and so determining the highest mass of brown dwarfs still containing lithium in the cluster can give an idea of its age. Applying this technique to the Pleiades gives <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> about 115 million years.|$|E

5|$|By the 15th century, writers, artists, {{and architects}} in Italy {{were well aware}} of the transformations that were taking place and were using phrases such as modi antichi (in the antique manner) or alle romana et alla antica (in the manner of the Romans and the ancients) to {{describe}} their work. In the 1330s Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as antiqua (ancient) and to the Christian period as nova (new). From Petrarch's Italian perspective, this new period (which included his own time) was <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> national eclipse.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{believed}} in the humanist ideal of the learned Renaissance prince whose authority depended on letters as well as arms. She {{was inspired by the}} example of her father-in-law, King Francis I of France, who had hosted the leading artists of Europe at his court, and by her Medici ancestors. In <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> civil war and declining respect for the monarchy, she sought to bolster royal prestige through lavish cultural display. Once in control of the royal purse, she launched a programme of artistic patronage that lasted for three decades. During this time, she presided over a distinctive late French Renaissance culture in all branches of the arts.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} {{about the history of the}} oldest exposed rocks in the area due to {{extensive}} metamorphism (alteration of rock by heat and pressure).

50|$|There is some {{disagreement}} over the evolutionary <b>age</b> <b>of</b> this system. Kinematic data gives <b>an</b> <b>age</b> estimate <b>of</b> about 10 Gyr.

Finally the age estimates using the isochrone method, which involve fitting the stars to evolutionary models, yield upper limits of 0.44 Gyr and 0.68 Gyr.

5|$|Little {{is known}} {{about the history of the}} oldest exposed rocks in the area due to {{extensive}} metamorphism; the rock has been pressure-cooked.

5|$|New Age thought {{typically}} envisions {{the world}} as developing through cosmological cycles which can be identified astrologically.

New Age literature often claims that humanity once lived in <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> spiritual wisdom. In the writings of New Agers like Edgar Cayce, the ancient period of spiritual wisdom is associated with concepts of supremely-advanced societies living on lost continents such as Atlantis, Lemuria, and Mu, {{as well as the}} idea that ancient societies like those of Ancient Egypt were far more technologically advanced than modern scholarship accepts.|$|E
