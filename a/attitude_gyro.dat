40|$|Gyroscopes {{based on}} micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) {{technology}} suffer in high-dynamic applications due to obvious g-sensitivity errors. These errors can induce large biases in the gyroscope, which can directly affect {{the accuracy of}} attitude estimation in {{the integration of the}} inertial navigation system (INS) and the Global Positioning System (GPS). The observability determines the existence of solutions for compensating them. In this paper, we investigate the observability of the INS/GPS system with consideration of the g-sensitivity errors. In terms of two types of g-sensitivity coefficients matrix, we add them as estimated states to the Kalman filter and analyze the observability of three or nine elements of the coefficient matrix respectively. A global observable condition of the system is presented and validated. Experimental results indicate that all the estimated states, which include position, velocity, <b>attitude,</b> <b>gyro</b> and accelerometer bias, and g-sensitivity coefficients, could be made observable by maneuvering based on the conditions. Compared with the integration system without compensation for the g-sensitivity errors, the attitude accuracy is raised obviously...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{attitude}} estimation {{has been}} performed {{using a combination}} of external attitude sensors and internal three-axis gyroscopes. There are many studies of three-axis attitude estimation using gyros that read angular rates. Rate-integrating gyros measure integrated rates or angular displacements, but three-axis attitude estimation using these types of gyros has not been as fully investigated. This paper derives a Kalman filtering framework for attitude estimation using attitude sensors coupled with rate- integrating gyroscopes. In order to account for correlations introduced by using these gyros, the state vector must be augmented, compared with filters using traditional gyros that read angular rates. Two filters are derived in this paper. The first uses an augmented state-vector form that estimates <b>attitude,</b> <b>gyro</b> biases, and gyro angular displacements. The second ignores correlations, leading to a filter that estimates attitude and gyro biases only. Simulation comparisons are shown for both filters. The work presented in this paper focuses only on attitude estimation using rate-integrating gyros, but it can easily be extended to other applications such as inertial navigation, which estimates attitude and position...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{design and}} comparison of a vision-aided uniformly semi-globally exponentially stable (USGES) nonlinear observer (NO) and a Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) for estimation of <b>attitude,</b> <b>gyro</b> bias, position and velocity of a fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The NO uses measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver, {{and a video}} camera. The MEKF and the NO are evaluated with real world experimental data. Moreover two new NO representations are proposed. The proposed NOs have a computer vision (CV) system {{that is based on}} epipolar geometry, and hence independent of the depth in the images and the structure of the terrain being filmed. The first proposed NO utilizes a camera and the continuous epipolar constraint and is named Continuous Epipolar Optical Flow Nonlinear Observer (CEOF NO). The second proposed NO uses a camera and the epipolar constraint and is named Epipolar Optical Flow Nonlinear Observer (EOF NO). Experimental data from a UAV test flight show that the vision-aided NO is substantially less computational demanding than the MEKF. It is seen that the NO has similar performance as the MEKF by means of accuracy of the estimates. The NO and the MEKF estimates are compared with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) implemented on the onboard autopilot of the UAV. The results illustrate that the estimates of the states converge accurately to the correct values. Moreover simulated data show that the proposed observers have more robust CV than the previous developed vision-aided NO, yielding more accurate and robust performance...|$|E

In Stage II, that design is recovered using measured signals only, by combining it with a position and velocity estimator. We prove exponential convergence of the estimation error from all desired initial conditions and test the design using realistic flight simulation. I...|$|R

Three attitudes and vertical velocity are separately commanded. Adaptation of the control laws is based on information from rate and <b>attitude</b> <b>gyros</b> and a vertical velocity measurement.

40|$|Abstract: We present two {{results on}} {{attitude}} estimation using vector and rate gyro measurements, when {{both sets of}} measurements are biased. The first result concerns an observer for <b>attitude</b> and <b>gyro</b> bias that has previously been presented by Hamel and Mahony, and by Mahony, Hamel, and Pflimlin, with proven almost-global stability results when either (i) the reference vectors in the inertial frame are stationary; or (ii) the reference vectors are time-varying but the gyro measurements are unbiased. We prove that the same observer with an added parameter projection is semiglobally exponentially stable when bias estimation is included and the reference vectors are time-varying. The second result concerns estimation of bias in the body-fixed vector measurements. We show how the bias can be estimated {{in a manner that}} is decoupled from the <b>attitude</b> and <b>gyro</b> bias estimation, provided the measurements are sufficiently excited relative to the level of measurement noise...|$|R

40|$|The NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS) in {{differential}} mode (DGPS) {{has been shown}} to be least accurate in the vertical axis. The vertical axis also has the most stringent accuracy requirements for aircraft precision approach and landing. A series of flight tests were conducted to evaluate a concept for improving the DGPS vertical axis navigation performance. These tests incorporated augmentation sensors to aid the DGPS navigation solution during terminal approach operations. A GPS receiver was installed on board a NASA helicopter and interfaced with a real-time digital computer system. A reconfigurable navigation filter programmed in the digital computer provided an augmented DGPS solution, with selectable inputs from a low-cost vertical accelerometer, a barometric altimeter, and the aircraft <b>attitude</b> <b>gyros.</b> The reference aircraft position was determined by a laser tracker. Extensive post-test analysis was done to optimize the filter performance during the terminal approach operation.

40|$|Flight {{research}} at high angles of attack has posed new problems for airdata measurements. New sensors and techniques {{for measuring the}} standard airdata quantities of static pressure, dynamic pressure, angle of attack, and angle of sideslip were subsequently developed. The ongoing airdata research supporting NASA's F- 18 high alpha research program is updated. Included are the techniques used and the preliminary results. The F- 18 aircraft was flown with three research airdata systems: a standard airdata probe on the right wingtip, a self-aligning airdata probe on the left wingtip, and a flush airdata system on the nose cone. The primary research goal was to obtain steady-state calibrations for each airdata system up to an angle of attack of 50 deg. This goal was accomplished and preliminary accuracies of the three airdata systems were assessed and are presented. An effort to improve the fidelity of the airdata measurements during dynamic maneuvering is also discussed. This involved enhancement of the aerodynamic data with data obtained from linear accelerometers, rate <b>gyros,</b> and <b>attitude</b> <b>gyros.</b> Preliminary results of this technique are presented...|$|R
40|$|Previous high {{fidelity}} onboard attitude algorithms estimated only the spacecraft <b>attitude</b> and <b>gyro</b> bias. The desire to promote spacecraft and ground autonomy {{and improvements in}} onboard computing power has spurred development of more sophisticated calibration algorithms. Namely, there is a desire to provide for sensor calibration through calibration parameter estimation onboard the spacecraft as well as autonomous estimation on the ground. Gyro calibration is a particularly challenging area of research. There {{are a variety of}} gyro devices available for any prospective mission ranging from inexpensive low fidelity gyros with potentially unstable scale factors to much more expensive extremely stable {{high fidelity}} units. Much research has been devoted to designing dedicated estimators such as particular Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithms or Square Root Information Filters. This paper builds upon previous attitude, rate, and specialized gyro parameter estimation work performed with Pseudo Linear Kalman Filter (PSELIKA). The PSELIKA advantage is the use of the standard linear Kalman Filter algorithm. A PSELIKA algorithm for an orthogonal gyro set which includes estimates of <b>attitude,</b> rate, <b>gyro</b> misalignments, gyro scale factors, and gyro bias is developed and tested using simulated and flight data. The measurements PSELIKA uses include gyro and quaternion tracker data...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a noncontact acquisition system composed of several time synchronized laser height sensors, accelerometers, gyroscope, {{and so forth}} in order to collect the road profiles of vehicle riding on the unstructured roads. A method of correcting road profiles based on the accelerometer and gyroscope data is proposed to eliminate the adverse impacts of vehicle vibration and attitudes change. Because the power spectral density (PSD) of <b>gyro</b> <b>attitudes</b> concentrates in the low frequency band, a method called frequency division is presented to divide the road profiles into two parts: high frequency part and low frequency part. The vibration error of road profiles is corrected by displacement data obtained through two times integration of measured acceleration data. After building the mathematical model between <b>gyro</b> <b>attitudes</b> and road profiles, the <b>gyro</b> <b>attitudes</b> signals are separated from low frequency road profile by the method of sliding block overlap based on correlation analysis. The accuracy and limitations of the system have been analyzed, and its validity has been verified by implementing the system on wheeled equipment for road profiles’ measuring of vehicle testing ground.

50|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of using IMUs for navigation {{is that they}} typically suffer from accumulated error. Because the guidance system is continually integrating acceleration with respect to time to calculate velocity and position (see dead reckoning), any measurement errors, however small, are accumulated over time. This leads to 'drift': an ever-increasing difference between where the system thinks it is located and the actual location. Due to integration a constant error in acceleration results in a linear error in velocity and a quadratic error growth in position. A constant error in <b>attitude</b> rate (<b>gyro)</b> results in a quadratic error in velocity and a cubic error growth in position.|$|R

40|$|Attitude {{estimator}} use {{observations from}} different times {{to reduce the}} effects of noise. If the vehicle is rotating, the attitude at one time needs to be propagated to that at another time. If the vehicle measures its angular velocity, attitude propagating entails integrating a rotational kinematics equation only. If a measured angular velocity is not available, torques can be computed and an additional rotational dynamics equation integrated to give the angular velocity. Initial conditions for either of these integrations come from the estimation process. Sometimes additional quantities, such as gyro and torque parameters, are also solved for. Although the partial derivatives of attitude with respect to initial <b>attitude</b> and <b>gyro</b> parameters are well known, the corresponding partial derivatives with respect to initial angular velocity and torque parameters are less familiar. They can be derived and computed numerically {{in a way that}} is analogous to that used for the initial <b>attitude</b> and <b>gyro</b> parameters. Previous papers have demonstrated the feasibility of using dynamics models for attitude estimation but have not provided details of how each angular velocity and torque parameters can be estimated. This tutorial paper provides some of that detail, notably how to compute the state transition matrix when closed form expressions are not available. It also attempts to put dynamics estimation in perspective by showing the progression from constant to gyro-propagated to dynamics-propagated attitude motion models. Readers not already familiar with attitude estimation will find this paper an introduction to the subject, and attitude specialists may appreciate the collection of heretofore scattered results brought together in a single place...|$|R
40|$|The loss {{function}} for the Wahba attitude estimation problem employs unit vector observations with scalar weights. It is {{usually associated with}} the QUEST observation model, where the actual sensor noise is assumed {{the same for all}} components of the observed vector, regardless of the position in the field of view. The QUEST model has the great advantage of being sensor-independent except for the scalar parameter that characterizes the sensor errors. Although efficient algorithms for solving the Wahba problem exist, extending these algorithms to estimate gyro biases or sensor alignments has had mixed success. However, it is straightforward to estimate bias and alignment parameters with a Kalman filter. This paper investigates the use of an extended Kalman filter for the <b>attitude</b> and <b>gyro</b> bias that incorporates the QUEST observation model, to be referred to as the Unit Vector Filter (UVF). The UVF results are compared with those from a more conventional filter, the Real-Time Sequential Filter (RTSF), for which the residual is the two-dimensional projection of the unit vector onto the plane perpendicular to the sensor boresight. The RTSF is similar in design to that used by Multimission Modular Spacecraft for onboard attitude determination. An apparent obstacle to the use of unit vectors as measurements is their singular noise covariance matrix. Shuster has shown that this problem should not affect filter performance. The UVF and RTSF are tested using actual flight data from the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE). It is found that these filters generate nearly identical <b>attitude</b> and <b>gyro</b> bias estimates, thus validating the use of unit vectors and the QUEST noise model...|$|R
