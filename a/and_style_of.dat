5|$|Both The Pleasure Garden and The Mountain Eagle were {{produced}} in co-operation with Emelka Film Studios in Munich, Germany. The film was mostly shot at Emelka in Munich {{in the fall}} of 1925, and the film exteriors were shot on location in Obergurgl, in what is now the municipality of Sölden in the State of Tyrol in southwestern Austria, the Ötztal Alps standing in for the mountains and hollows of Kentucky. Due to producing the film in Germany, Hitchcock had more directorial freedom than he would have had in England, and influences in the technique <b>and</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> German cinema are evident in his early works.|$|E

5|$|Brisco was {{developed}} by Boam and Cuse {{at the request of}} Fox executive Bob Greenblatt. Impressed by the duo's work on the script for Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Greenblatt suggested they develop a series that bore the tone <b>and</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> vintage movie serials. The initial ideas and proposals from the show's writers were more often suited for film than television and had to be scaled down. Brisco {{was one of the last}} television shows to be filmed on the Warner Bros. Western backlot. Randy Edelman composed the distinctive theme music, which has been reused by the National Broadcasting Company during its coverage of the Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|Coleman {{hired the}} Portland company Sandstrom Design {{to help with}} marketing. Sandstrom helped to improve the promotional {{materials}} of the organization, while Portland Center Stage modified the nature <b>and</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> its performances. Sandstrom Design produced a 56-page flyer that showed the performance schedule for the 2003–2004 season which was mailed to subscribers, potential customers, handed out at performances and placed around town. The promotional campaign stressed the unique qualities of a live theater performance as entertainment over television and film. PCS's productions were presented in the Winningstad and Newmark theatres in Portland through the 2005–2006 season. Portland Center Stage moved to the new Gerding Theater at the Armory beginning with the 2006–2007 season.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Ian Gillan {{announced}} the band would fold, as {{he needed to}} rest his damaged vocal cords. The tone <b>and</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> his singing changed considerably when he eventually returned. His voice had a more nasal tone and this can be heard on albums he has made from 1983 to the present day. His use of multi-tracked backing vocals also became highly prominent. The rest of the band Gillan, particularly McCoy and Towns, were not happy at the sudden disbanding of the group so soon after the success of Magic, and sued Gillan for royalties.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, the {{construction}} of war cemeteries, graves and their associated memorials were typically placed {{under the control of}} a central state authority. The Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) took on this role for Britain and her empire. The Commissione nazionale per la onoranze ai caduti di guerra in Italy coordinated the military repatriation of bodies and {{the construction}} of cemeteries. The German war graves commission, the Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge (VDK), was established in 1919, and took strict control over the creation <b>and</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> German war cemeteries. The American Battle Monuments Commission oversaw US military graves in a similar fashion.|$|E
5|$|Madonna's look <b>and</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> dressing, her performances, and {{her music}} videos {{influenced}} young girls and women. Her style {{became one of}} the female fashion trends of the 1980s. Created by stylist and jewelry designer Maripol, the look consisted of lace tops, skirts over capri pants, fishnet stockings, jewelry bearing the crucifix, bracelets, and bleached hair. Madonna's popularity continued to rise globally with the release of her second studio album, Like a Virgin, in November 1984. It became her first number-one album in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, the UK, and the US. Like a Virgin was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America and sold more than 21 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Pinafores {{extraordinary}} {{popularity in}} Britain, America and elsewhere {{was followed by}} the similar success of a series of Gilbert and Sullivan works, including The Pirates of Penzance and The Mikado. Their works, later known as the Savoy operas, dominated the musical stage {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic for more than a decade and continue to be performed today. The structure <b>and</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> these operas, particularly Pinafore, were much copied and contributed significantly to the development of modern musical theatre.|$|E

5|$|The building, though {{based on}} Classical {{architecture}} {{is not entirely}} a Classical building.

5|$|Fellow {{players on}} the Italian {{national}} team nicknamed Pirlo l'architetto ("the Architect"), {{because of the way}} in which he buildt plays, and set up goal-scoring opportunities with long, lobbed through passes. In later seasons, Juventus fans also dubbed him il professore ("the professor"), Maestro, and Mozart, as a reference to the Austrian composer's prodigious ability. Pirlo was also frequently compared to fellow former Milan and Italy playmaker Demetrio Albertini early in his Milan career, due to their similar characteristics <b>and</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> play. Pirlo was often thought to be Albertini's heir for Milan and the national side; he inherited his nickname the metronome whilst playing at Milan, for the way in which he influenced games by controlling the tempo of his team's play through his direct and efficient passing game in midfield, as well as his ability to make himself available to teammates to receive and distribute the ball.|$|E
5|$|The Persian {{infantry}} used in {{the invasion}} was probably a heterogeneous group drawn from across the empire. However, according to Herodotus, {{there was at least}} a general conformity in the type of armour <b>and</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> fighting. The troops were, generally speaking, armed with a bow, 'short spear' and sword, carried a wicker shield, and wore at most a leather jerkin. The one exception to this may have been the ethnic Persian troops, who may have worn a corslet of scale armour. Some contingents would have been armed somewhat differently; for instance, the Saka were renowned axemen. The 'elite' contingents of the Persian infantry seem to have been the ethnic Persians, Medians, Cissians and the Saka; Herodotus specifically mentions the presence of Persians and Saka at Marathon. The style of fighting used by the Persians was probably to stand off from an enemy, using their bows (or equivalent) to wear down the enemy before closing in to deliver the coup de grace with spear and sword.|$|E
