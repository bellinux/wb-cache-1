25|$|The {{ornamentation}} of an arch {{was intended}} to serve as <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> visual <b>reminder</b> of the triumph and triumphator. The façade was ornamented with marble columns, and the piers and attics with decorative cornices. Sculpted panels depicted victories and achievements, the deeds of the triumphator, the captured weapons of the enemy or the triumphal procession itself. The spandrels usually depicted flying Victories, while the attic was often inscribed with a dedicatory inscription naming and praising the triumphator. The piers and internal passageways were also decorated with reliefs and free-standing sculptures. The vault was ornamented with coffers. Some triumphal arches were surmounted by a statue or a currus triumphalis, a group of statues depicting the emperor or general in a quadriga.|$|R

The paintings are set on a pedestal that represents the realm of the King of Nagas amidst Dakinis (mKha-hgro-ma), and the pinnacle in the painting denotes the domain of Brahma. The paintings also depict Klu (Naga) demigods with a human head and the body of a serpent, which are said to reside in lakes (said to denote that they are guarding the hidden treasures). Allegorically, they mean to represent the spiritual holy writings. The paintings also show what is termed as “Walkers in the Sky” (mKha-hgro-ma).|$|E
5|$|The Praetorian Guard was {{an elite}} {{unit of the}} Roman army formed by Augustus in 27 BC, with the {{specific}} function {{to serve as a}} bodyguard to the emperor and members of the imperial family. Much more than a guard however, the Praetorians also managed the day-to-day care of the city, such as general security and civil administration. Furthermore, their presence served as <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> to the people and the Senate of the substantial armed force which served {{as the basis for the}} imperial power. Augustus was careful however to uphold the republican veneer of this regime, and only allowed nine cohorts to be formed (one fewer than in a normal Roman legion), which were inconspicuously scattered across various lodging houses in the city, and commanded by two prefects.|$|E

Radford’s spectacular goal on a mud-covered Edgar Street pitch - watched by the TV cameras and greeted with unbridled glee by 26-year-old rookie commentator John Motson - equalised Malcolm Macdonald’s opener for the Magpies and is <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> and wonderful <b>reminder</b> of the magic of The FA Cup.

25|$|Some manga are {{completely}} drawn in the bishonen style, such as Saint Seiya. Bishōnen manga are generally shōjo manga (girls' comics) or yaoi (girls' comics focused on homosexual relationships between beautiful boys), however shōnen manga (boy's comics) may use casts of bishōnen characters for crossover appeal to female readers. Mainstream shounen and seinen fare also often uses such characters as rivals for a traditional masculine protagonist, {{with some degree}} of comic relief, or for the blander everyman, whether as the embodiment of his insecurities in a grittier realism, or as <b>a</b> more lighthearted <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> of his less than advantageous social status and the constraints thereof. Comics for younger boys tend to use arrogant bishounen {{in the role of the}} recurring minor rivals readers love to hate, though their effeminate good looks there will often appear older, bigger, stronger, and thus in fact more masculine than the commonly shorter and less mature protagonists.|$|R

Some triumphal arches were surmounted by a statue or a currus triumphalis, a group of statues depicting the emperor or general in a quadriga. The inscriptions on Roman triumphal arches were works of art in themselves, with very finely cut, sometimes gilded letters. The form of each letter and the spacing between them was carefully designed for maximum clarity and simplicity, without any decorative flourishes, emphasizing the Roman taste for restraint and order. This conception of what later became the art of typography remains of fundamental importance down to the present day.|$|R

25|$|In {{a special}} queer issue of The Stranger in 1999, openly gay author, pundit, and {{journalist}} Dan Savage questioned {{the relevance of}} pride thirty years later, writing that pride was an effective antidote to shame imposed on LGBT people, but that pride is now making LGBT people dull and slow as a group, {{as well as being}} <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> of shame. However, he also states that pride in some simpler forms are still useful to individuals struggling with shame. Savage writes that gay pride can also lead to disillusionment where an LGBT individual realises the reality that sexual orientation doesn't say much about a person's personality, after being led by the illusion that LGBT individuals are part of a co-supportive and inherently good group of people.|$|E
500|$|Adams's {{life was}} greatly {{affected}} by his father's {{involvement in a}} banking controversy. In 1739, Massachusetts was facing a serious currency shortage, and Deacon Adams and the Boston Caucus created a [...] "land bank" [...] which issued paper money to borrowers who mortgaged their land as security. The land bank was generally supported by the citizenry and the popular party, which dominated the House of Representatives, the lower branch of the General Court. Opposition to the land bank came from the more aristocratic [...] "court party", who were supporters of the royal governor and controlled the Governor's Council, the upper chamber of the General Court. The court party used its influence to have the British Parliament dissolve the land bank in 1741. Directors of the land bank, including Deacon Adams, became personally liable for the currency still in circulation, payable in silver and gold. Lawsuits over the bank persisted for years, even after Deacon Adams's death, and the younger Samuel Adams often had to defend the family estate from seizure by the government. For Adams, these lawsuits [...] "served as <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> personal <b>reminder</b> that Britain's power over the colonies could be exercised in arbitrary and destructive ways".|$|R

25|$|When Gaston {{arrived to}} the Pawn Shop, he aims {{at what he}} thought was Gold but discovers a {{mannequin}} instead. He is then confronted by Belle, who now knows he was willing to kill Rumple and believed he still had feelings for her, only to learn that the book was punishment and <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> of why he died. He was also shocked to discover Belle is now Gold's wife, and leaves furious. Belle tells Gold and made him promise not to hurt Gaston, but when she tells Gold about what Hades told her he just couldn't accept what Belle wanted. At the docks, Gold uses magic to choke Gaston by the throat, ready to send him to the River of Lost Souls, when Belle pulls the dagger and commands him not to hurt Gaston, and he drops Gaston on the ground. However, Gaston is unable to let his vendetta against Gold go, and when he goes for his arrow, Belle accidentally knockes Gaston out into the River of Lost Souls. Unfortunately, Belle discovers that because she saved Gold but interfered, Hades arrives to tell the couple that the contract allowing him to take their baby was still in effect, as Belle was the one who knocked Gaston into the Acheron, not Gold. He then looks at a withering daisy flower that he picks up, as a sign of hope fading away. The burned flower later shows up at Granny's Diner, as a gift to Zelena from Hades.|$|E

[...] He went on to declare his approval of the decision to depict Anthony on the coins:I am particularly pleased that the new dollar coin will—for the first time in history—bear the image of a great American woman. The life of Susan B. Anthony exemplifies the ideals for which our country stands. The 'Anthony dollar' will symbolize for all American women the achievement of their unalienable right to vote.

500|$|As of 2009, the {{congregation}} had approximately five thousand {{two hundred and}} nine parishioners. Mount Saint Peter Church serves {{as a symbol of}} faith and what can be accomplished when people work together for a common belief, hope, and dream. The church's new motto, adopted in 2004, reflected this balance: [...] "to restore all things in Christ...with the fire of love." [...] This motto serves as <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> {{of the history of the}} parish. The beauty of the Mellon Mansion was restored by {{the congregation}} and turned into a House of God. This was done through a strong love of Christ, faith, and neighbor. The names of the volunteers who helped build the church are carved in the marble inside the main entrance of the church and serve as a token of the congregation's appreciation. Many of today's parishioners are descendants of those volunteers and are proud to tell the story of their forefathers who gave them this church in which to practice their faith.|$|E

40|$|AIM [...] To {{assess the}} {{relationship}} between national and local media campaigns {{with respect to the}} number of patients requesting HIV antibody tests as a surrogate marker of the effectiveness of different campaign strategies. METHODS [...] Analysis by month of the numbers of HIV tests performed in the regional genitourinary (GUM) clinic for Lothian over a 5 year period and in the whole of Lothian Region, Scotland over a 3 year period. Changes in testing rates were monitored with respect to media campaigns over the same time period. RESULTS [...] Television based media campaigns produced the greatest increase in testing rates (average 46 % increase over 2 months) compared with newspapers and poster campaigns (average 6 % increase over 2 months). Regional HIV testing rates correlated significantly with GUM clinic testing rates. No increase in positive HIV tests was seen following media campaigns. CONCLUSIONS [...] Using HIV testing rates as a surrogate marker, television based media campaigns appear to be the most effective way of increasing awareness of HIV. The effect of media campaigns is short-lived indicating <b>a</b> need for <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> of the dangers of HIV infection. The increase in HIV testing occurs largely in the "worried well" with few additional HIV positive patients being identified...|$|R
500|$|The {{presentation}} of Empire City was also {{considered to be}} a significant factor {{of the success of the}} game. The climbing and grabbing aspect was considered well done and avoided a [...] "frustration-fest" [...] that other games with precision jumping generally bring about, according to Miller. However, some reviewers noted that Cole's climbing ability was too touchy, with the character grabbing onto ledges too greedily, making it difficult to fine-tune jumps. In combination with Cole's other powers, Miller cited the game as having the [...] "most original city-traversal mechanics" [...] for an open-world game. The behavior of the city's population and how that was affected by the player's choice in Karma was also seen as a positive, and as <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> of the game's setting. The game's story, particularly in the second half of the game, was considered to be strong, enhanced by {{presentation of}} the cut-scenes. However, the quality of these scenes was seen to negatively highlight the poor animation used for in-game generated cut-scenes and the quality of the voice work; Miller considered Cole's voice to be too gravelly for the character.|$|E
500|$|In A Game of Thrones, Jon Snow is {{introduced}} as the 14-year-old bastard son of Eddard [...] "Ned" [...] Stark, Lord of Winterfell, and half-brother to Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon. Jon {{is described as}} having strong Stark features with a lean build, long face, dark brown hair and grey eyes. Jon has the surname [...] "Snow" [...] (customarily used for illegitimate children in the North) and is resented by Ned's wife Catelyn, who views him as <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> of Ned's infidelity. Jon is {{the same age as}} Robb and enjoys a warm relationship with his siblings, particularly the tomboy Arya (who resembles Jon and like him does not feel like she fits in). Ned treats Jon as much like his other children as propriety and his honor will allow. Still, as somewhat of an outsider, Jon has learned to be independent and to fend for himself when necessary. Jon idolizes his father, but is wounded by Ned's refusal to tell him about his mother. At the beginning of the story, Jon adopts the albino direwolf that he names Ghost. He later finds that at times he can [...] "inhabit" [...] the wolf and share its experiences.|$|E
500|$|The Bridge on the Drina remains Andrić's {{most famous}} novel and has {{received}} the most scholarly analysis of all his works. Most scholars interpret the eponymous bridge as a metonym for Yugoslavia, which was itself a bridge between East and West during the Cold War, [...] "partaking of both but being neither". However, {{at the time of}} writing, the country did not enjoy the reputation of an inter-civilizational mediator, which was fostered by Tito only after his split with Stalin in 1948. Thus, the novel can be seen as having contributed to the formation of this national self-image. Andrić suggests that the building of roads and bridges by Great Powers is rarely done as a gesture of friendship towards local populations, but rather as a means of facilitating imperialist conquest. Thus, the bridge is both a symbol of unification and division. It is a symbol of unification in that it allows the inhabitants of Višegrad to cross from one bank to the other and in that the kapija serves as a popular meeting place. On the other hand, it divides the town's inhabitants by acting as <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> of the Ottoman conquest.|$|E

The {{heritage}} of blood his father had bequeathed him, the unshakable love for a worthless girl who had so dwarfed and obstructed his will and so bitterly defeated and reviled his poor, romantic, boyish faith, the killing of hostile men, so strange in its after effects, the pursuits and fights, and loss of one by one of his confederates--these had finally engendered in Jean Isbel a wild, unslakable thirst, these had been the cause of his retrogression, these had unalterably and ruthlessly fixed in his darkened mind one fierce passion--to live and die the last man of that Jorth-Isbel feud.|$|R

In 2007, Gaga and Kelly were working with RedOne in a small {{recording}} studio in Queens, New York. Gaga was writing [...] "what would later become" [...] her debut studio album The Fame (2008) and Kelly was writing songs with RedOne to pitch to other artists. Kelly recalled the events by saying: [...] "We were all friends and often rode the train together {{to get to the}} studio". RedOne began working with Akon, who had signed Chynn to his record label. Akon and RedOne flew Gaga and Kelly to Los Angeles to write songs for Chynn's second studio album Prima Donna. [...] "Hypnotico" [...] became the first of several songs they had written together. From that trip, according to Kelly, [...] "Akon met, signed and helped launch Lady Gaga's career". Kelly credits the trip as also helping to launch his own songwriting career.

From that CD of tracks he wrote songs for Leona Lewis ("Forgive Me"), Whitney Houston ("Like I Never Left", [...] "I Got You") and Michael Jackson ("Hold My Hand"). According to Kelly, [...] "Hypnotico" [...] is a [...] "symbol of how dreams come true if you work hard, and <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> of how far I've come.
