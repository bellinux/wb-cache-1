5|$|Petrossian {{originally}} thought {{to write a}} video treatment about a refugee trying to enter the United States, but knew that the band was going to receive several treatments with the same idea. Instead, he decided to portray {{the plight of the}} refugee from <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>angle.</b> The band members unanimously agreed upon Petrossian's treatment. The video deals various themes, including consumerism, fair trade, and sweatshops, and attempts showcase how conventional business models allow for various human rights violations.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} Foucault replaces the {{cogwheel}} by a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light {{travels to the}} distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>angle</b> on its way out than it {{is on its way}} back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and the distance to the distant mirror the speed of light may be calculated.|$|E

Shot from <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>angle,</b> the footage shows Harwood draw his arm back to head height before bringing the baton down on Tomlinson's legs. McCallum was filming another incident at the time; the Tomlinson incident was unfolding in the background, unseen by the journalists but {{recorded by the}} camera. Half an hour later Alex Thomson, chief correspondent of Channel4 News, was doing a live broadcast when the camera was damaged. It took engineers days to recover the tape, which is when they saw that Tomlinson's assault was on it.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of more sophisticated SAMs such as the MIM-104 Patriot and the US Navy's Aegis combat system {{put pressure on the}} Soviets to develop better ARMs in turn. Zvezda came at the problem from <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>angle</b> to Raduga, having a background in lightweight air-to-air missiles. However, in the mid-1970s they had developed the successful Kh-25 family of short-range air-to-surface missiles, including the Kh-25MP (AS-12 'Kegler') for anti-radar use. Zvezda started work on a long-range ARM and the first launch of the Kh-31 was in 1982. It entered service in 1988 and was first displayed in public in 1991, the Kh-31P at Dubai and the Kh-31A at Minsk.|$|E
25|$|A diving mask (also half mask, {{dive mask}} or scuba mask) is {{an item of}} diving {{equipment}} that allows underwater divers, including, scuba divers, free-divers, and snorkelers to see clearly underwater. Surface supplied divers usually use a full face mask or diving helmet, but in some systems the half mask may be used. When the human eye is {{in direct contact with}} water as opposed to air, its normal environment, light entering the eye is refracted by <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>angle</b> and the eye is unable to focus the light. By providing an air space in front of the eyes, light enters normally and the eye is able to focus correctly.|$|E
25|$|Another tactic is {{pretending to}} pass the ball, called 'dummying'. It can be used during normal backline play {{or as part of}} a set move. The aim of the dummy is to confuse the {{opposition}} and create a gap for the player carrying the ball. When used as a set move a player will run as a decoy, usually at <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>angle</b> {{to the rest of the}} players. In complicated moves there will be multiple players acting as decoys. Care must be taken to ensure the decoys do not impede the tacklers, which would result in a penalty being awarded to the defenders.|$|E

25|$|The mast head {{instruments}} {{indication of}} apparent wind speed and direction {{is different from}} what the sailor sees and feels near the surface. Sailmakers may introduce sail twist {{in the design of}} the sail, where the head of the sail is set at <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>angle</b> of attack from the foot of the sail in order to change the lift distribution with height. The effect of wind gradient can be factored into the selection of twist in the sail design, but this can be difficult to predict since the wind gradient may vary widely in different weather conditions. Sailors may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for wind gradient, for example using a boom vang.|$|E
25|$|Lozenge {{camouflage}} came {{in varying}} widths, sometimes in 4.5-foot-wide (1.4 m) bolts of fabric, and pieces were cut to fit between the leading and trailing {{edges of the}} wing. Fabric sections laid chordwise were lined up next to each other so that the pattern repeated itself regularly across the wing, except for the ailerons which were covered in fabric laid sparwise, perpendicular to the wing pattern. Some aircraft had the fabric applied diagonally. As a part of field repairs, regularly laid fabric patterns from the factory might be overlaid with the same pattern but at <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>angle,</b> or with fabric from a different camouflage design. Later in the war, some patterns were applied more quickly with fabric laid sparwise along the full wingspan. Hasty factory work began to resemble the rushed field repairs.|$|E
25|$|The {{most basic}} {{feature is the}} {{integrated}} bidet, a nozzle {{the size of a}} pencil that comes out from underneath the toilet seat and squirts water. It has two settings: one for washing the anus and one for the bidet. The former is called posterior wash, general use, or family cleaning, and the latter is known as feminine cleaning, feminine wash or simply bidet. At no point does the nozzle actually touch the body of the user. The nozzle is also self-cleaning and cleans itself before and after operation. The user can select to wash the anus or vulva by pressing the corresponding button on the control panel. Usually the same nozzle is used for both operations, but at a different position of the nozzle head, and using different openings in the nozzle to squirt water at <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>angle</b> to aim for the correct spot. Occasionally, two nozzles are used, each dedicated for one area. The control logic is also attached to a pressure switch or a proximity sensor in the toilet seat, and operates only when the seat is occupied. The very first models did not include this automatic switch-off. A number of curious users pressed the button while watching the toilet to see its mode of operation, and promptly received a jet of warm water in their faces.|$|E
