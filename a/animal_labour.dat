At the time, farm work was extremely arduous, because on the typical farm virtually nothing could get done without manual labour or <b>animal</b> <b>labour</b> as the motive power. As his interest in automobiles grew, he also expressed a desire to [...] "lift the burden of farming from flesh and blood and place it on steel and motors." [...] In the early 20th century, he began to build experimental tractors from automobile components. Four years after founding the Ford Motor Company in 1903, Ford finished his first experimental tractor in 1907 on Woodward Avenue in Detroit, referring to it as the [...] "Automobile Plow". Approximately 600 gasoline-powered tractors were in use on American farms in 1908.

And a new manufacturing process made nitrogen fertilizer [...] - [...] first synthesized in the mid-19th century [...] - [...] affordably abundant. These factors changed the labor equation: there were almost no tractors in the US around 1910, but over 3,000,000 by 1950; in 1900, it took one farmer to feed 2.5 people, but currently the ratio is 1 to well over 100. Fields grew bigger and cropping more specialized to make more efficient use of machinery. The reduced need for manual labour and <b>animal</b> <b>labour</b> that machinery, herbicides, and fertilizers made possible created an era in which the mechanization of agriculture evolved rapidly.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Sustainable {{development}} in modern animal husbandry {{has to deal}} with multiple challenges, like its environmental foot print, the welfare of <b>animals,</b> <b>labour</b> issues and economical rentability. If solved separately, they might very well contradict each other. To circumvent this, structural change of our production and consumption systems is required. This cannot be attained by mere technical innovation alone, but asks for a reorientation of the existing sociotechnical regime, that shapes current practice. In this paper we present Reflexive Interactive Design (RIO) as a systematic approach to do this, and show its application in an ongoing project to deliver designs for sustainable dairy production, and to contribute to the effective reformation of the current dairy production system. RIO aims to increase the chance of structural change in existing systems, necessary to solve a number of sustainability issues at the same time. RIO is built upon three pillars: 1. systematic reflexion on the current structural arrangements of the system and the needs of key actors involved (system analysis). 2. designing new systems or structural arrangements using a systematic design approach (structured design), and; 3. strategically using concepts and reflexions to attain effective reformism (anticipation on existing structures). We describe the application of RIO in a project running since 2007 aimed at the development o...|$|R

40|$|Reunion Island, {{situated}} in the Indian Ocean, presents a unique case study for modelling regional bio-economic parameters of the dairy industry. It {{is a good example}} of a closed system for several parameters of the model such as movement of <b>animals,</b> <b>labour,</b> consumption and available land. The existence of several agro-ecological zones from tropical to temperate, and various different types of terrain and vegetation presents another unique opportunity to study the impact of these features on the dairy industry. The present study models the dairy sector at a regional (island) level to study the impact of new or adapted agricultural policies in relation to changes in subsidy levels, price fluctuations and environmental policies (mainly nitrogen management). The model can be used to generate a number of scenarios to explore the effects of various policy measures, such as fixing the stocking rate according to EU norms, increasing or decreasing the milk subsidy, intensification (such as an increase in milk production to the allotted quota of 40 million litres/yr) and varying labour/price constraints (such as a reduction in labour hours or an increase or decrease in the milk price). The model is being utilized by the local dairy cooperative as a discussion support tool to study the implications at the regional scale of expanding the sector and assessing its economic, environmental and social impac...|$|R
50|$|Mons Claudianus {{was linked}} to the river Nile by a {{traceable}} surviving Roman road marked by way-stations spaced out at one day intervals. The stones from the quarries, which were shaped in the desert, were then taken along the road to the Nile Valley for trans-shipment to Rome. Documents that were found on site referred to 12-wheeled and 4-wheeled carts, and include a request for delivery of new axles. The journey would last approximately five days or longer. The way-stations, which resembled small defended 'forts', with many rooms accompanied by stabling and a water-supply, served as motels where the men and animals moving the stones could rest, eat and drink. Donkeys may have been used to transport food and water needed by men between way-stations as well as to pull the wagons; however, for larger loads it seems that both human and <b>animal</b> <b>labour</b> was used. Camels were used for communication and for the transport of food and water.The columns may have also been dragged more than 100 km from the quarry to the river on wooden sledges, though the terrain from quarry to the Nile is such that the route was downhill the entire length. They were floated by barge down the Nile River when the water level was high during the spring floods, and then transferred to vessels to cross the Mediterranean Sea to the Roman port of Ostia. There, they were transferred back onto barges and pulled up the Tiber River to Rome.|$|E
50|$|Farmers in Starrs Point and Canard {{began to}} discuss {{building}} a large dyke {{at the mouth}} of the Canard River in 1809. They may have been inspired by the three mile long Wickwire Dyke completed near Wolfville in 1808. The Planters at Canard had gradually added to the Acadian dykes along the edges of the river but a dyke at near the mouth of the river would reclaim an additional 700 acres of farmland from the Minas Basin and save the maintenance of the many smaller dykes along the river which protected over 2,000 acres. A plan was organized in 1811. Materials were gathered and construction began in 1817. The dyke was named after the Duke of Wellington following his defeat of Napoleon in 1815. The new structure was a dramatic change from the Acadian dyke systems which were only a few feet high in most places. The Wellington Dyke would be 50 feet high, 120 feet at the base and over 300 feet long with additional embankments stretching over a mile just in from the mouth of the river. The aboiteau or sluice which allowed the river to drain was 100 feet and 14 feet wide. The work was financed and organized solely by the 70 farmers of the Wellington Marsh Body. It was built in stages seasonally, between high tides using only human and <b>animal</b> <b>labour.</b> At its peak over 100 teams of horses and oxen and 300 men worked on the dyke. Rum rations were issued as an incentive with extra shares for those who had to work in the water. In some places the swift tidal currents swept away nine out of every ten cart loads of fill.|$|E

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth-century, human and veterinary surgeons faced the challenge of a medical marketplace transformed by technology. The socio-economic value ascribed to their patients – people and domestic animals – was changing, reflecting the increasing mechanisation of industry and the decreasing dependence of society upon non-human <b>animals</b> for <b>labour.</b> In human medicine, concern for the economic consequences of fractures “pathologised” any significant level of post-therapeutic disability, a productivist perspective contrary to the traditional corpus of medical values. In contrast, veterinarians adapted to the mechanisation of horse-power by shifting their primary professional interest to companion animals; a type of veterinary patient generally valued for the unique emotional attachment of the owner, and not the productive capacity of the animal. The economic rationalisation of human fracture care and the “sentimental” transformation of veterinary orthopaedic expertise indicates how these specialists utilised increasingly convergent rhetorical arguments to justify the application of innovative fracture care technologies to their humans and animal patients.

40|$|<b>Animal</b> {{husbandry}} and <b>labour</b> migration {{are important}} livelihood strategies {{for a large}} proportion of the rural population in developing countries. Up to now, the two strategies have usually been studied by looking at either one or the other; their interlinkages have rarely been examined. Based on a case study in rural Kyrgyzstan, the aim of this paper is to explore the links between <b>animal</b> husbandry and <b>labour</b> migration. Results show that for most rural households, livestock is crucial yet not sufficient to make a living. Therefore, many people diversify their income sources by migrating to work elsewhere. This generates cash for daily expenses and the acquisition of new livestock, but also leads to an absence of workforce in households. Yet since remittances usually exceed the expenses for hiring additional workforce, most people consider migration profitable. From a socio-economic point of view, migration and animal husbandry can thus be considered important complementary livelihood strategies for the rural Kyrgyz population, at least for the time being. In the long term, however, the failure of young migrants to return to rural places and their settlement in urban areas might also cause remittance dependency and lead to an increasing lack of qualified labour. From an environmental point of view, the investment of remittances into animal husbandry poses challenges to sustainable pasture management. Increasing livestock numbers in rural areas raise pressure on pasture resources. Since most people consider animal husbandry their main future prospect while continuing to use pastures in a fairly unsustainable way, this may further exacerbate the over-utilization of pastures in future...|$|R
