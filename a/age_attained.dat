40|$|The major Czechoslovak {{cohort of}} uranium miners (S-cohort) is {{surveyed}} {{in terms of}} diagrams illustrating dependences on calendar year, age, and exposure to radon and radon progeny. An analysis of the dose dependence of lung cancer mortality is performed by nonparametric and, subsequently, by parametric methods. In the first step, two-dimensional isotonic regression is employed to derive the lung cancer mortality rate and the relative excess risk as functions of <b>age</b> <b>attained</b> and of lagged cumulated exposure. In a second step, analytical fits in terms of relative risk models are derived. The treatment is largely analogous to the methods applied by the BEIR IV Committee to other major cohorts of uranium miners. There is a marked dependence of the excess risk on <b>age</b> <b>attained</b> and on time since exposure. A specific characteristic of the Czechoslovak data is the nonlinearity of the dependence of the lung cancer excess risk on the cumulated exposure; exposures {{on the order of}} 100 working level months or less appear to be more effective per working level month than larger exposures but, {{in the absence of an}} internal control group, this cannot be excluded to be due to confounders such as smoking or environmental exposures. A further notable observation is the association of larger excess risks with longer protraction of the exposures. ...|$|E

The pension program will give pension benefit to the goverment employees on their retirement age. Pension funding requires actuarial computation which normal cost and actuarial liability. Actuarial computation is divided into two major parts, Accrued Benefit Cost Method and Projected Benefit Cost Method. One of Accrued Benefit Cost Method example is Projected Unit Credit and for the Projected Benefit cost one of the method is <b>Attained</b> <b>Age</b> Normal. This research uses secondary data from PT. TASPEN (Persero) KCU Semarang. Computation result shows on the both second normal cost the method tends to increase each year. Projected Unit Credit Method exhibits substansial increment, meanwhile on <b>Attained</b> <b>Age</b> Nornal Method the increment is relatively slow.

40|$|Models for {{the dose}} and age {{dependence}} of radiation induced cancer {{have been based}} primarily on the follow-up {{of the atomic bomb}} survivors. Two different concepts have been deduced for leukaemias and for other cancers. The excess leukaemias appear in a distinct temporal wave with a maximum 5 to 10 years after radiation exposure; the distribution is more narrow for younger ages, but there is little dependence of the total attributable risk on age at exposure. For other cancers the latent periods are longer and, according to the current interpretation, the excess rates are then proportional to the age specific spontaneous rates, so that most excess cases would arise at old age. The factors of proportionality, and thus the attributable risks, are assumed to be markedly higher for young ages at exposure. It is argued here that there is no firm support for this interpretation. The present analysis compares the current model for cancers other than leukaemia to a more meaningful alternative than the so-called additive model which is usually invoked as a standard of comparison. The analysis is performed in terms of analytical expressions, to make the characteristics of the different concepts more transparent. It is seen that the Japanese data are equally well fitted by a model that assumes no dependence of sensitivity on age at exposure but merely accounts for a dependence of the excess risks on dose and on <b>age</b> <b>attained.</b> This 'age attained model' corresponds, in essence, to formulations that have been used earlier for the analysis of lung cancers in uranium miners. The data up to 1985 for the atomic bomb survivors do not yet permit a decision between the different models. But the acceptability of the <b>age</b> <b>attained</b> model shows that age dependencies for leukaemias and other cancers to be less fundamentally different than commonly assumed. The <b>age</b> <b>attained</b> model leads to risk projections for young ages at exposure that are substantially lower than present estimates. In fact it predicts essentially the same lifetime attributable risk for exposures at young and intermediate ages; decreased risks result only for exposures at advanced ages where the expression periods are already substantially reduced. ...|$|E

With no mortality below the highest <b>age</b> <b>attained</b> (75 or 85), and constant below replacement fertility, we find that t*, the time to decline, varies dramatically {{with the level of}} fertility, moderately with longevity, and modestly with the mean age of fertility.|$|E

Mortality risk for each BMI quintile (I, 27. 4 kg/m 2) was determined from a proportional hazard regression with adjustment for age and other covanables. In this population, the overall BMI-mortalrty relation showed dependence on age, duration of follow-up, and baseline indicators of preexisting illness (weight fluctuation, history of major chronic disease, and severe physical complaints). Therefore, the analysis focused on women with no indicators of preexisting illness, and risk estimates were stratified by age at baseline and duration of follow-up. Among middle-aged women (ages 30 - 54 years), the authors found a weak linear relation dunng years 1 - 8 (median <b>attained</b> <b>age,</b> 51 years), a significant linear relation during years 9 - 14 (median <b>attained</b> <b>age,</b> 57 years), and a significant nonlinear (U-shaped) relation during years 15 - 26 (median <b>attained</b> <b>age,</b> 68 years).

40|$|The nominal risk {{coefficients}} for radiation induced cancer are {{largely based on}} the follow-up of the mortality from solid cancers among the atomic bomb survivors. For {{those who have been}} exposed as adults, the observations are essentially complete, and the risk estimates are, therefore, firmly based on observations. Those who have been exposed as children, have still not reached the age of high cancer incidence. Their observation is, therefore, still incomplete, and the risk estimates are correspondingly uncertain. The modelling of risk has predominantly been based on the postulate, that the relative risk (i. e. the actual cancer rate divided by the age specific normal rate) depend on dose and on age at exposure, and that it does not decline with time since exposure. The high relative risks observed at young ages lead, therefore, with this type of model, to high estimates of life time attributable risk. The ICRP recommendations contain these high risk estimates for young ages at exposure; the high sensitivity of children and juveniles has, indeed, become one of the basic tenets of radiation protection. It is here shown that these conclusions are still hypothetical, because they are merely a matter of the choice of the model. An alternative model assumes a dependence of the excess relative risk on <b>age</b> <b>attained,</b> rather than age at exposure. This model fits the data equally well, and predicts no increased risk for young ages at exposure. A decision between the two models is not possible at present, it will have to await the continued follow- up of those who survived the atomic bombs as children. The ICRP has been criticised for postulating a dose reduction factor (DDREF) in their nominal risk coefficients. If they abandoned this factor, and used the <b>age</b> <b>attained</b> model, rather than their present model, their numerical risk coefficients would remain unchanged. ...|$|E

Older empirical data indicate, however, that the participation of the Czech adult population in programmes of adult learning is not very common. The aim of this article, which is based on a special representative survey, ‘Adult Learning 2005 ’, is to confront how far Czech reality is from the ideal concepts of ‘lifelong learning’ and a ‘learning society’. The authors pursue three questions: 1) To what extent is it true that education in the Czech Republic is a lifelong affair? 2) Does education of this kind occur on both a formal and non-formal level? 3) Do the Czechs engage in lifelong education, regardless of <b>age,</b> <b>attained</b> level of education, gender, and occupational status? Empirical data reveal that, despite the fact that Czech educational authorities give formal support to adult education, reality ‘in the field’ is somewhat different. Education in the Czech Republic is still not lifelong; if it exists it occurs mainly within the framework of non-formal education, and only higher educated people and those with some experience in adult education participate in it...|$|E
