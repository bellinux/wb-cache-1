50|$|Current {{literature}} {{also indicates}} that mathematics involves visuo-spatial processing. Studies have found that gifted students in math, for instance, perform better in spatial visualization than non-gifted students. A 2008 review {{published in the journal}} of Neuroscience Biobehavioural Reviews found evidence that visuo-spatial processing is intuitively involved in many <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> numbers and calculating in math. For example, meaning of a digit in a multi-digit number is coded following spatial information given its relation to its position within the number. Another study found that numerical estimation might rely on integrating different visual-spatial cues (diameter, size, location, measurement) to infer an answer. A study published in 2014 also found evidence that mathematical calculation relies on the integration of various spatial processes. Another 2015 study published in the journal of Frontiers in Psychology also found that numerical processing and arithmetic performance may rely on visual perceptual ability.|$|E

50|$|On the ontogenetic time scale, the Competition Model {{posits that}} {{language}} emergence can {{be examined in}} at least two ways. One methodology uses neural network models to simulate the acquisition of detailed grammatical structures. Competition Model researchers have constructed connectionist models for the acquisition of morphology, syntax, and lexicon in several languages, including English, German, and Hungarian. More recently, the ontogenetic emergence of language has been examined from a biological viewpoint, using data on language processing from children with early focal lesions. The results of studies of these children using reaction time methodologies and neuropsychological tests indicate that, although they have completely normal functional use of language, detailed <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> are slower in some cases. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging technology, areas of neurological activation involved in specific linguistic tasks have been pinpointed in these children. These results have allowed researchers to evaluate a series of hypotheses regarding sensitive periods for the emergence of language in the brain.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{a number}} of {{investigators}} have examined the neural loci of psychological processes enabling the control of visual spatial attention using cued-attention paradigms in combination with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. Findings from these studies have provided strong evidence for the involvement of a fronto-parietal network in attentional control. In the present study, we build upon this previous work to further investigate these attentional control systems. In particular, we employed additional controls for nonattentional sensory and interpretative <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> cue <b>processing</b> to determine whether distinct regions in the fronto-parietal network are involved in different <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> cue <b>processing,</b> such as cue-symbol interpretation and attentional orienting. In addition, we used shorter cue-target intervals that were closer to those used in the behavioral and event-related potential cueing literatures. Twenty participants performed a cued spatial attention task while brain activity was recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found functional specialization for different <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> cue <b>processing</b> in the lateral and medial subregions of the frontal and parietal cortex. In particular, the medial subregions were more specific to the orienting of visual spatial attention, while the lateral subregions were associated with more general <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> cue <b>processing,</b> such as cue-symbol interpretation. Additional cue-related effects included differential activations in midline frontal regions and pretarget enhancements in the thalamus and early visual cortical areas...|$|R

30|$|According to the {{bottleneck}} {{theory of}} attention, attention can be allocated {{to only one}} task at a time. Thus, multitasking is a myth; instead, the mind switches between tasks. Stimuli arrives at a processing ‘bottleneck,’ at which only one item can be processed at a time (Broadbent, 1958; Maslovat et al., 2013). Because attentional resources are limited, filtering of stimuli must occur. The bottleneck postpones <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> of the secondary task until the primary task is completed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The digital {{world of}} Grid {{technologies}} meets {{the physical world}} {{through a variety of}} sensors, instruments and interfaces. The e-Science programme has increasingly become aware of the need to focus on this digital-physical interface of the grid, and the ubiquitous computing community is beginning to look towards the Grid for <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing,</b> data handling and access (for example, in sensor networks). There are also opportunities to apply infrastructure and middleware techniques across these distributed computing domains. In this paper we survey the activities which bring together Grid and pervasive computing, drawing examples from the e-Science programme which engage with both areas of research and highlight how the two have a symbiotic relationship. From this we identify areas for further research...|$|E
