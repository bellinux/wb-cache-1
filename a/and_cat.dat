All cool-season vegetable plantings, {{and the entire}} banana crop, were lost during Frances. The pineapple crop was significantly impacted by wind damage in Eleuthera, while the entire fruit crop was lost for similar reasons. The corn crop in Long Island <b>and</b> <b>Cat</b> Island was completely lost. Significant poultry losses were experienced.|$|E
5|$|The tenth series sees Lister still {{travelling}} with Rimmer, Kryten <b>and</b> <b>Cat</b> on Red Dwarf, {{in hopes}} of eventually locating Kochanski above getting back to Earth. Neither the tenth nor eleventh series have confirmed whether the Rimmer onboard ship {{is the one who}} originally left, the revived version, or a third incarnation entirely; however, episodes have alluded to him remembering events from both previous incarnations' lives.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the eighth series, Kryten's nanobots reconstruct the Red Dwarf, which they had broken down into its constituent atoms. In the process, the entire crew of the ship – including a pre-accident Rimmer – are resurrected, but the Starbug crew find themselves sentenced to two years in the ship's brig (at first, for crashing a Starbug and bringing onboard Kryten <b>and</b> <b>Cat</b> as stowaways, but later for using information from the confidential files). The series ends with a metal-eating virus loose on Red Dwarf. The entire resurrected crew evacuates save the original dwarfers. In the cliffhanger ending, Rimmer is left stranded alone to face Death (and promptly knees him in the groin and flees).|$|E

5|$|The Egyptians {{associated}} many gods {{who took}} felid form with the sun, and many lioness deities, like Sekhmet, Menhit, and Tefnut, were equated with the Eye. Bastet was depicted {{as both a}} domestic cat and a lioness, and with these two forms she could represent both the peaceful and violent aspects of the Eye. Yet another goddess of the solar Eye was Mut, the consort of the god Amun, who was associated with Ra. Mut was first called the Eye of Ra in the late New Kingdom, and the aspects of her character that {{were related to the}} Eye grew increasingly prominent over time.

40|$|Gastrointestinal {{zoonotic}} helminths of dogs <b>and</b> <b>cats</b> have {{a public}} health concern worldwide. We investigated the prevalence of gastrointestinal helminths of zoonotic significance in dogs <b>and</b> <b>cats</b> in lower Northern Thailand and utilized molecular tools for species identification of hookworms and Opisthorchis viverrini. Fecal samples of 197 dogs <b>and</b> 180 <b>cats</b> were collected. Overall prevalence of infection using microscopy was 40. 1 % in dogs and 33. 9 % in cats. Helminth infection found in both dogs <b>and</b> <b>cats</b> included hookworms, Spirometra spp., Taenia spp., Toxocara spp., 0. viverrini, Strongyloides spp. and Trichuris spp. Hookworms were the most common helminth in dogs, while Spirometra spp. were the most prevalent in cats. Among hookworm infection in dogs <b>and</b> <b>cats,</b> Ancylostoma ceylanicum was the most prevalent hookworm, being 82. 1 % in hookworm infected dogs and 95. 8 % in hookworm infected cats. Mixed-infection due to hookworms and Spirometra spp. was the most dominant in both dogs <b>and</b> <b>cats.</b> Our finding showed that zoonotic helminth infection is highly prevalent in dogs <b>and</b> <b>cats</b> in the lower Northern area of Thailand...|$|R

In addition, Moretti volunteered for an organization called Best Friends Animal Society, which is a no-kill animal shelter (a shelter that does not euthanize to control animal populations) in Utah.

5|$|Cats {{are similar}} in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong {{flexible}} body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey.

They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and {{a better sense of}} smell than humans.
