5|$|Part IV {{of the act}} {{covers the}} {{delegation}} of powers to agents, and the trustees liability for their acts. This is <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> long been criticised by practitioners and academics, particularly {{the provisions of the}} Trustee Act 1925. The Act allowed the trustees to appoint an agent in good faith, and gave them no liability for the agent's acts. In Re Vickery it was confirmed that a trustee may escape liability for an agent's acts if he acted in good faith, which was simply a test of honesty rather than reasonableness.|$|E

Belgrade was made the seat of the district (Sanjak), becoming the second largest Ottoman town in Europe at over 100,000 people, surpassed only by Constantinople. Ottoman rule also introduced Ottoman architecture, including numerous mosques, increasing the city's Oriental influences. In 1594, a major Serb rebellion was crushed by the Ottomans. Later, Grand vizier Sinan Pasha ordered the relics of Saint Sava to be publicly torched on the Vračar plateau; in the 20th century, the Temple of Saint Sava was built to commemorate this event.|$|E

25|$|The Sedan shot {{resulted}} in a radioactive cloud that separated into two plumes, rising to 3.0km and 4.9km (10,000ft and 16,000ft). The two plumes headed northeast and then east in roughly parallel paths towards the Atlantic Ocean. Nuclear fallout was dropped along the way, narrowly dispersed in {{a relatively small number}} of United States counties. Detected radioactivity was especially high in eight counties in Iowa and one county each in Nebraska, South Dakota and Illinois. The most heavily affected counties were Howard, Mitchell and Worth counties in Iowa, as well as Washabaugh County in South Dakota, <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> since been incorporated into Jackson County and is wholly within Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.

2500|$|While {{foraging}} for tree roots, plant bulbs, {{or ground}} squirrels, bears stir up the soil. This process not only helps grizzlies access their food, but also increases species richness in alpine ecosystems. An area that contains both bear digs and undisturbed land has greater plant diversity than {{an area that}} contains just undisturbed land. Along with increasing species richness, soil disturbance causes nitrogen to be dug up from lower soil layers, and makes nitrogen more readily available in the environment. <b>An</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been dug by the grizzly bear has significantly more nitrogen than an undisturbed area.|$|E

2500|$|Whilst the {{historian}} Keith Thomas had touched {{on the subject}} of English popular magic in his Religion and the Decline of Magic (1971), in a 1994 article {{on the subject of}} the cunning folk, {{the historian}} Willem de Blécourt stated that the study of the subject, [...] "properly speaking, has yet to start." [...] These ideas were echoed in 1999, when the historian Ronald Hutton, in his The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft, remarked that the study of the cunning folk and European folk magic was [...] "notoriously, <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been comparatively neglected by academic scholars." [...] Nonetheless, articles on the subject were published in the late 1990s, primarily by the historian Owen Davies, who in 2003 published Cunning-Folk: Popular Magic in English History (which was later republished under the altered title of Popular Magic: Cunning-folk in English History in 2007). This was followed in 2005 with the publication of Emma Wilby's Cunning-Folk and Familiar Spirits: Shamanistic Visionary Traditions in Early Modern British Witchcraft and Magic, which took a somewhat different attitude to the cunning craft than Hutton and Davies, emphasising the spiritual as opposed to simply practical side to cunning folk's magic.|$|E
