5000|$|Most {{extension}} cables {{made with}} 20 A stage pin connectors use 12/3 type SOOW or SJOOW cable which has three individually insulated 12 awg (American Wire Gauge) stranded conductors inside a larger jacket. The internal insulation is usually colored black (for line), white (for neutral) and green(for ground). This cable configuration can safely handle the full 20 <b>ampere</b> <b>rating</b> of the connector. The designation SOOW or SJOOW {{refers to the}} cable's insulation construction and type. SJ— (300 volts, maximum) and S— (600 volts, maximum) are both [...] "most severe" [...] service cordage. This type of cable is very hard-wearing, resistant to oil and moisture, and resists the kinking that can result in internal conductors unlaying and twisting, which is a common problem with the SJTW cable often used in household-grade extension cords. However, older cable made using natural rubber is susceptible to dry-rotting, particularly in the heat generated by lighting equipment. This can cause the insulation to fail and expose or short circuit the conductors leading to shock or fire hazard if old cable is not inspected regularly and replaced as needed.|$|E
5000|$|Lucas type fuses {{are used}} in old British-made or {{assembled}} automobiles. The physical length of this ceramic type of fuse is either 1 inch or 1.25 inch, with conical ends. Glass tube fuses have straight ends. Lucas type fuses usually use the same color-coding for the rated current. Lucas fuses have three ratings; the continuous current {{they are designed to}} carry, the instantaneous current at which they will fuse, and the continuous current at which they will also fuse. The figure found on Lucas fuses is the continuous fusing current which is twice the continuous <b>ampere</b> <b>rating</b> that the system should be using; this can be a source of confusion when replacing Lucas fuses with non Lucas fuses. The Lucas 1/4" [...] diameter glass tube fuse have a different length as compared to the standard US item.

40|$|Application {{of energy}} {{efficient}} compressors, {{air handling units}} (AHUs), condensers and evaporators of high effectiveness are the some of the measures towards energy conservation in refrigeration systems. Cooling of compressor shell with the defrost drips is an energy saving measure which is explored in this paper. In tropical countries which have 70 – 80 % RH year round, the quantity of defrost formation is significant while refrigeration systems are on. This defrost water is dripped on the compressor's shell, which in turn cools the compressor oil and hence reduces the friction losses and winding temperature of the motor. Once winding temperature is reduced the compressor's <b>ampere</b> <b>rating</b> is reduced which ultimately reduces the energy consumption of the compressor. For given conditions of refrigerator function, the compressor shell temperature and <b>ampere</b> <b>rating</b> of compressor are tabulated and investigated before and after compressor shell cooling. The investigation reveals that around 8 – 10 % energy savings are achieved for the given conditions...|$|E

50|$|Miniature circuit {{breakers}} and fuses may be rated to interrupt {{as little as}} 85 amperes and are intended for supplementary protection of equipment, not the primary protection of a building wiring system.

Accessories such as instrument transformers, surge arresters, and capacitors are also made in compatible housings. Due to the expense of its construction and the energy loss, isolated-phase bus is usually used in short segments; a large underground powerhouse may have isolated-phase bus up to about 250 metres or so to connect generators to transformers in an underground cavern.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Synchronous {{reluctance}} {{machine with}} simple salient rotor {{is known to}} have poor power factor because of its poor reactance ratio. This study presents the use of an auxiliary winding attached to a balanced capacitor to improve the effective reactance ratio as well as the performance characteristics of synchronous reluctance machine. A unique feature of this configuration is that although the machine runs at synchronous speed, the effective reactance ratio of the machine can be improved by appropriate sizing of the capacitor attached to the auxiliary winding, with the constraint of the <b>ampere</b> turn <b>rating</b> of the auxiliary winding. The operational characteristics of a simple salient rotor synchronous reluctance machine equipped with this configuration were investigated and shown to have a desirable performance. How the effective reactance ratio, power factor and airgap flux distribution depend on the size of capacitor attached to the auxiliary winding is determined using a simplified mathematical model of the system. Analytical results and experimental measurements are in good agreement, and demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of the configuratio...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} four {{different}} charge methods {{on the energy}} conversion efficiency of 300 ampere hour lead acid traction cells were investigated. Three of the methods were positive pulse charge waveforms; the fourth, a constant current method, {{was used as a}} baseline of comparison. The positive pulse charge waveforms were: 120 Hz full wave rectified sinusoidal; 120 Hz silicon controlled rectified; and 1 kHz square wave. The constant current charger was set at the time average pulse current of each pulse waveform, which was 150 amps. The energy efficiency does not include charger losses. The lead acid traction cells were charged to 70 percent of <b>rated</b> <b>ampere</b> hour capacity in each case. The results of charging the cells using the three different pulse charge waveforms indicate {{there was no significant difference}} in energy conversion efficiency when compared to constant current charging at the time average pulse current value...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} analysis of a novel T-connected autotransformer based 30 -phase ac-dc converter which supplies direct torque controlled induction motor drives (DTCIMD’s) {{in order to have}} better power quality conditions at the point of common coupling. The proposed converter output voltage is accomplished via three paralleled 10 -pulse ac-dc converters each of them consisting of 5 -phase diode bridge rectifier. A T-connected autotransformer is designed to supply the rectifiers. This autotransformer makes use of only two single-phase transformers, resulting in reduced volume, weight, and the cost of the drive as compared with polygon structure. The design procedure of magnetics is in a way such that makes it suitable for retrofit applications where a six-pulse diode bridge rectifier is being utilized. The proposed converter requires only three inter-phase transformers in the dc link that yields in the reduced kilovolt <b>ampere</b> <b>rating,</b> size, weight, and cost of the proposed rectifier. The aforementioned structure improves power quality criteria at ac mains and makes them consistent with the IEEE- 519 standard requirements for varying loads. Furthermore, near unity power factor is obtained {{for a wide range of}} DTCIMD operation. A comparison is made between 6 -pulse and proposed converters from view point of power quality indices. Results show that input current total harmonic distortion (THD) is less than 3 % for the proposed topology at variable loads...|$|E

A comparison of the intermediate range start-up rate readings with the start-up rates determined from the slope of the intermediate-range log-level current as a function of time curves indicates that the intermediate-range start-up rate circuitry was properly aligned. The power inception point, determined from the intermediate-range log-level current and reactor coolant-temperature data, occurred at an average log-level current of 5 x 10 /sup -//sup 7 / amperes, assuming that all of the heat of the pumps was disposed of by venting steam to atmosphere. The decade overlap of the intermediate range into the source range varied from 0. 95 to 1. 95 source range decades with an average overlap of 1. 1 decades.

40|$|Six {{ampere hour}} {{individual}} pressure vessel nickel hydrogen cells were charge/discharge cycled to failure. Failure as used here is defined to {{occur when the}} end of discharge voltage degraded to 0. 9 volts. They were cycled under a low earth orbit cycle regime to a deep depth of discharge (80 percent of <b>rated</b> <b>ampere</b> hour capacity). Both cell designs were fabricated by the same manufacturer and represent {{current state of the}} art. A failure model was advanced which suggests both cell designs have inadequate volume tolerance characteristics. The limited existing data base at a deep depth of discharge (DOD) was expanded. Two cells of each design were cycled. One COMSAT cell failed at cycle 1712 and the other failed at cycle 1875. For the Air Force/Hughes cells, one cell failed at cycle 2250 and the other failed at cycle 2638. All cells, of both designs, failed due to low end of discharge voltage (0. 9 volts). No cell failed due to electrical shorts. After cell failure, three different reconditioning tests (deep discharge, physical reorientation, and open circuit voltage stand) were conducted on all cells of each design. A fourth reconditioning test (electrolyte addition) was conducted on one cell of each design. In addition post cycle cell teardown and failure analysis were performed on the one cell of each design which did not have electrolyte added after failure.
