5|$|Bristol won the Type I and Type III contracts, {{delivering}} their Type I design, the Bristol Brabazon in 1949. The {{requirement for}} the 1946 British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) Medium Range Empire (MRE) Requirements coincided with the Type III, Specification C.2/47, issued in April 1947 by the Minister of Supply. The specifications called for <b>an</b> <b>airliner</b> capable of carrying 48 passengers and powered with Bristol Centaurus radial engines or Napier Nomad turbo-compound diesel engine. Turboprop options were also considered, but they were so new that Bristol could not guarantee the performance specifications.|$|E
5|$|STAC {{suggested}} that two designs naturally {{fell out of}} their work, a transatlantic model flying at about Mach 2, and a shorter-range version flying at perhaps Mach 1.2. Morgan {{suggested that}} a 150-passenger transatlantic SST would cost about £75 to £90million to develop, and be in service in 1970. The smaller 100 passenger short-range version would cost perhaps £50 to £80million, and be ready for service in 1968. To meet this schedule, development would need to begin in 1960, with production contracts let in 1962. Morgan strongly suggested that the US was already involved in a similar project, and that if the UK failed to respond it would be locked out of <b>an</b> <b>airliner</b> market that he believed would be dominated by SST aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The player {{takes on}} the role of various {{characters}} during a single-player campaign. The characters' involvement in the plot occurs simultaneously and overlaps the events in the game. As such, the player's perspective changes from one character to another between missions. Each mission features a series of objectives; the player is led to each objective with the heads up display, which marks its direction and distance. Some objectives require that the player arrives at a checkpoint, while other objectives require the player to eliminate enemies in a specified location, stand their ground to defend an objective, or plant explosive charges on an enemy installation. After the credits, a special epilogue mission is unlocked for play, featuring a four-man squad retrieving a VIP from terrorists who have hijacked <b>an</b> <b>airliner.</b> The SAS rescue the VIP and escape before the plane is destroyed. The main campaign features 30 collectible pieces of intel that award the player with game cheats and visual filters such as infinite ammunition, cluster grenades, and increased contrast.|$|E
5|$|The game's second case, Turnabout Airlines, {{takes place}} in the present, and has Edgeworth {{becoming}} involved with the smuggling ring during a trip aboard <b>an</b> <b>airliner.</b> An Interpol agent investigating the smuggling is murdered during the trip, and Edgeworth and a flight attendant become the main suspects. Another prosecutor, Franziska von Karma, works with Interpol to expose the smuggling ring; she and Edgeworth discover the murderer to be another flight attendant, who is working with the smuggling ring. In the third case, The Kidnapped Turnabout, Edgeworth is called by Ernest Amano, whose son Lance has been kidnapped and is held at an amusement park. While attempting to exchange the ransom money, Edgeworth is also kidnapped, but is freed by Kay, who calls herself the true Yatagarasu. They release Lance, and find the dead body of Oliver Deacon, who Lance identifies as one of the kidnappers. As Edgeworth investigates the mystery, he meets Interpol agents Shi-Long Lang and Shih-na, who believe that Amano's business group is involved with the smuggling ring; the ring's counterfeit money has ruined the economy of their home country Zheng Fa, so they seek {{to bring an end to}} the ring. Edgeworth learns that the kidnapping was a ploy by Lance to get money from his father, and that Lance had killed Deacon after the latter tried to back out of the plan. Evidence is found tying Amano to the smuggling ring, and Lang brings Amano in for questioning.|$|E

25|$|The Rohrbach Ro III was a twin-engined, {{all-metal}} {{flying boat}} built in Germany in the mid-1920s. A {{development of the}} Ro II, it could be configured either as <b>an</b> <b>airliner</b> or a reconnaissance aircraft. It was developed into the similar but more powerful Ro IIIa Rodra (Ro + dr(ei) + a), intended only as a military reconnaissance/bomber. Four Ro IIIs were bought by Japan and two Rodras by Turkey.|$|E
25|$|Airbus {{sought to}} compete with the {{well-established}} Boeing in the 1970s through its introduction of advanced technology. For example, the A300 made the most extensive use of composite materials yet seen in an aircraft of that era, and by automating the flight engineer's functions, was the first widebody jet to have a two-man flight crew. In the 1980s Airbus was the first to introduce digital fly-by-wire controls into <b>an</b> <b>airliner</b> (the A320).|$|E
25|$|Apart from {{military}} use, some civilian aircraft are also equipped with countermeasure flares, against terrorism: the Israeli airline El Al, having {{been the target}} of the failed 2002 airliner attack, in which shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles were fired at <b>an</b> <b>airliner</b> while taking off, began equipping its fleet with radar-based, automated flare release countermeasures from June 2004.

25|$|Operation Entebbe {{was perhaps}} the most {{dramatic}} event during Rabin's first term of office. On his orders, the IDF performed a long-range undercover raid to rescue passengers of <b>an</b> <b>airliner</b> hijacked by militants belonging to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine's Wadie Haddad faction and the German Revolutionary Cells (RZ), who had been brought to Idi Amin's Uganda. The operation was generally considered a tremendous success, and its spectacular character has made it the subject of much continued comment and study.|$|E
25|$|The appropriate/intermediate {{technology}} {{principles to}} which most Soviet airliners before the Il-86 {{had been designed}} meant that they had typically five-member flight crews. The design and entry into service in 1972 of the Tu-154, <b>an</b> <b>airliner</b> built to high technology principles (more automation, less human input), showed that Soviet science lagged behind {{in the development of}} avionics which would remove the need for navigators and radio operators. A programme of avionics development was mounted to enable the Il-86 to operate in most weathers with a three-member flight crew, matching Western technology of the time.|$|E
