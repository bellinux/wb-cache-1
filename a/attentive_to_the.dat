Analysis of the teachers’ choices of tasks and their explanations revealed categories that fall into two dimensions: (1) Attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mathematics in which the argumentative activity is embedded, focusing on three aspects: the mathematics inherent in the task; <b>the</b> mathematics related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> teaching sequence that the task is a part of; and meta-level principles of mathematics. (2) Attention to socio-cultural aspects related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> argumentative activity. Four attention-profiles of teachers were identified: Teachers who attended to both dimensions; teachers who were <b>attentive</b> only <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mathematics aspects inherent in the task; teachers who were <b>attentive</b> only <b>to</b> <b>the</b> socio-cultural dimension; and teachers who were <b>attentive</b> <b>to</b> neither of these dimensions...|$|R

25|$|Some {{findings}} {{in the fields of}} cosmology, evolutionary biology and neuroscience are interpreted by some atheists (including Lawrence M.

These atheists claim that a single, omniscient God who is imagined to have created the universe and is particularly <b>attentive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lives of humans has been imagined, embellished and promulgated in a trans-generational manner. Richard Dawkins interprets such findings not only as a lack of evidence for the material existence of such a God, but as extensive evidence to the contrary. However, his views are opposed by some theologians and scientists including Alister McGrath, who argues that existence of God is compatible with science.|$|E
25|$|Justice or {{fairness}} {{refers to}} the idea that an action or decision is morally right, which may be defined according to ethics, religion, fairness, equity, or law. People are naturally <b>attentive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> justice of events and situations in their everyday lives, across a variety of contexts (Tabibnia, Satpute, & Lieberman, 2008). Individuals react to actions and decisions made by organizations every day. An individual's perceptions of these decisions as fair or unfair can influence the individual's subsequent attitudes and behaviors. Fairness is often of central interest to organizations because the implications of perceptions of injustice can impact job attitudes and behaviors at work. Justice in organizations can include issues related to perceptions of fair pay, equal opportunities for promotion, and personnel selection procedures.|$|E

Heeling {{is one of the}} most basic obedience exercises and as such it is often incorporated into other exercises such as the moving stand and the figure 8.

Whether positive or negative, the music critics only assessed part of Kay's original work. In considering the original television version of Twice, the literary critic Laura Severin, praised the contrasted voices {{and the use}} of repetition as an adaptation to a medium where listeners would be less <b>attentive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> words than if they were attending a conventional poetry reading. She also saw Kay's portrayal of Rossiter as one that avoided both a conventional masculine representation of her as a ruthless murderer and an overly simplistic feminist one of her as a passive victim.|$|E

[...] The solid dark background of the blackboard helps the subject to stand out but almost obscures Rockwell's signature. According to Deborah Solomon, the work [...] "imbues the speaker with looming tallness and requires his neighbors to literally look up to him." [...] The speaker represents a blue-collar unattached and sexually available, likely ethnic, threat to social customs who nonetheless is accorded the full respect from the audience. Some question the authenticity of white-collar residents being so <b>attentive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> comments of their blue-collar brethren.

To that end, I develop a conception of praxis that is centered on the idea that practical agents act within and toward practical horizons rather than exercising a faculty of choice within stable decision spaces.

Any such judgment must be defended on pragmatic grounds, which means {{that it must be}} <b>attentive</b> <b>to</b> consequences. <b>The</b> second point is that the consequentialist judgments that support minimalism also suggest that there are times and places in which minimalism is rightly abandoned. For example, broad rulings may well be justified when predictability calls for it; and the Supreme Court was right to refuse minimalism in the late 1930 s. While minimalism is generally <b>the</b> proper approach <b>to</b> “frontiers” issue in constitutional law, its own pragmatic foundations suggest that constitutional law should not be insistently or dogmatically minimalist...|$|R
