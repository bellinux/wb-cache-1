5|$|Biblical and extrabiblical {{evidence}} suggests that of the Arabian tribes, the Qedarites were most prominent in their contacts with the world outside of the Arabian Peninsula.

5|$|Crinolines {{were worn}} by women of every social {{standing}} and class across the Western world, from royalty to factory workers.

The play focuses on Caligula's love for his sister Drusilla and his deep-rooted loathing for Tiberius. It received its world premiere in New York City in June 2008.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{feature of}} the meeting at Peterloo {{was the number of}} women present. Female reform societies had been formed in North West England during June and July 1819, the first in Britain. Many of the women were dressed distinctively in white, and some formed all-female contingents, carrying their own flags. Of the 654recorded casualties, at least 168 were women, four of whom died either at St Peter's Field or later as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> wounds. It has been estimated that less than 12 per cent of the crowd was made up of women, suggesting that they were at significantly greater risk of injury than men by a factor of almost 3:1. Richard Carlile claimed that the women were especially targeted, a view apparently supported by the large number who suffered from wounds caused by weapons.|$|E

25|$|Islam {{integrated}} {{the concept}} of Jinn from pre-Islamic animism, but reduced {{the status of the}} former divine Jinn to mortals and created entities, who share the earth along with humans and will be judged on judgement Day by the only one God. Accordingly, the society of Jinn resembles that of humans, and are believed to procreate, eat, sleep, die and practise religion. Due to their similarities with humans, several narrations hold, that humans and Jinn may have sexual interactions and some legal book even deal with conditions of a marriage between these different beings. Nevertheless, Islam forbids interaction with Jinn. The Jinn may also cause possession and harm humans, but Jinn attacks are considered as <b>an</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own intention instead of evil nature, although an individual Jinni maybe evil, but then because of its own decision. The Jinn live either in an intermediary realm, between the divine world and the physical plane, like the Greek Daemon and ancient Rome Genii or roaming earth invisible to humans eye.|$|R
