5|$|Carnotaurus is {{the only}} known {{carnivorous}} bipedal <b>animal</b> <b>with</b> a pair of horns on the frontal bone. The use of these horns is not entirely clear; several interpretations have revolved around use in fighting conspecifics, in display, or in killing prey.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, two Brazilian zoologists {{described}} {{a new species}} of arachnid called Taito spaceinvaders Kury & Barros, 2014, inspired in the game because of the resemblance of a fleck in the dorsal scutum of the <b>animal</b> <b>with</b> the typical alien of the game.|$|E
5|$|In September 2012, zoo {{customers}} were herded indoors when a Heck bull escaped from its enclosure. The 600kg <b>animal</b> <b>with</b> three feet long horns was loose for over 40 minutes, until zoo workers and vets managed to restrain him by using tranquilliser darts.|$|E
5000|$|Mechanical design {{can also}} {{determine}} the maximum allowable size for a species. <b>Animals</b> <b>with</b> tubular endoskeletons {{tend to be}} larger than <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> exoskeletons or hydrostatic skeletons.|$|R
50|$|Although salps appear {{similar to}} {{jellyfish}} {{because of their}} simple body form and planktonic behavior, they are chordates: <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> dorsal nerve cords, related to vertebrates, <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> backbones.|$|R
5000|$|Basic {{physiological}} design {{plays a role}} in {{the size}} of a given species. For example, <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> a closed circulatory system are larger than <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> open or no circulatory systems.|$|R

5|$|Heart {{conditions}} in the Sussex Spaniel can include pulmonary valve stenosis, {{which is the most}} common of the congenital heart defects. Essentially, in an <b>animal</b> <b>with</b> this condition, the pulmonary valve is improperly formed which causes the heart to work much faster to pump blood around the body. The final results of this condition can be swelling of fluid in the chambers of the heart, thickening of the heart muscle known as ventricular hypertrophy leading to eventual heart failure.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match on}} the card was between MNM (Johnny Nitro and Joey Mercury, managed by Melina) and The Legion of Doom (Heidenreich and Road Warrior Animal) for the WWE Tag Team Championship. During the match, Nitro hit <b>Animal</b> <b>with</b> one of the {{championship}} belts, but Animal retaliated by powerslamming him. Animal and Heidenreich then performed the doomsday device on Nitro and scored the pin to win the match and the titles.|$|E
5000|$|Yosemite Sam {{made two}} cameo {{appearances}} in a MetLife commercial in 2012. In {{one of the}} ads, a producer knocked on Yosemite Sam's trailer and he thought there were [...] "varmints" [...] bothering him and he took down and shot some fur coats of <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> rage. Even though he would shoot some <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> rage, his temper calmed and revived the <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> puppies.|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the nephroprotective effects of CAN in complex pharmacotherapy in a rat model of active Heymann’s autoimmune glomerulonephritis (AIG). The study comprised the following groups: 1) healthy <b>animals,</b> 2) <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> AIG, 3) <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> AIG treated with CAN (for 60  days), 4) <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> AIG treated with the standard immunodepressant prednisolone (for 60  days), and 5) <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> AIG treated with prednisolone in combination with CAN (for 60  days). Evaluation of pharmacological effect of the treatments was performed using a series of laboratory tests recommended for preclinical studies [19].|$|R
40|$|Rats {{were trained}} in shock-induced aggression, free operant avoidance, or were {{presented}} with unavoidable shocks. Fighting in response to shock was subsequently measured by intermatching individual animals that had received the three training procedures. The fighting probabilities of <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> histories of avoidance and dominant <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> histories of fighting were higher than the fighting probabilities of non-dominant fighting rats or rats {{with a history of}} unavoidable shocks. <b>Animals</b> <b>with</b> higher fighting probabilities disrupted avoidance baselines more than <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> lower fighting probabilities. Control experiments suggested that fighting decrements produced by administration of prior grid-shock were due to the acquisition of behaviors incompatible with aggression...|$|R
5|$|Tigers {{and their}} superlative qualities {{have been a}} source of fascination for mankind since ancient times, and they are {{routinely}} visible as important cultural and media motifs. They are also considered one of the charismatic megafauna, and are used as the face of conservation campaigns worldwide. In a 2004 online poll conducted by cable television channel Animal Planet, involving more than 50,000 viewers from 73 countries, the tiger was voted the world's favourite <b>animal</b> <b>with</b> 21% of the vote, narrowly beating the dog.|$|E
5|$|A {{pathology}} {{has been}} identified on the tail of Apatosaurus, caused by a growth defect. Two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone, including the arches of the neural spines. This defect might {{have been caused by}} the lack or inhibition of the substance that forms intervertebral disks or joints. It has been proposed that the whips could have been used in combat, but the tails of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to Shunosaurus and mamenchisaurids, and thus to injure another <b>animal</b> <b>with</b> the tail would severely injure the tail itself.|$|E
5|$|Although Ferugliotherium {{teeth are}} much lower-crowned {{than those of}} the Sudamericidae, they share an {{essentially}} similar pattern on the occlusal (chewing) surface of mf1 and mf2, similar incisors, backward jaw movement during chewing, and enamel with small prisms. Ferugliotherium is thought to have been a small <b>animal,</b> <b>with</b> a body mass of about 70g (2.5oz), and may have eaten insects and plant material. Its remains have been found in two geological formations of southern Argentina, where {{it is part of a}} mammal fauna that also includes the sudamericid Gondwanatherium and a variety of dryolestoids.|$|E
50|$|The lowest {{frequency}} {{which can be}} localized depends on the ear distance. <b>Animals</b> <b>with</b> a greater ear distance can localize lower frequencies than humans can.

30|$|Shrinkage of tumours was {{observed}} in H 69 tumour-bearing <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> large tumours and a delay of tumour growth around 70  days after 213 Bi-DOTATATE (cumulative injected activity of 9.4 [*]±[*] 0.7  MBq) treatment. In CA 20948 tumour-bearing <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> large tumours, the inhibition of tumour growth was initiated around 30  days after therapy (cumulative injected activity 10.2 [*]±[*] 0.4  MBq 213 Bi-DOTATATE), leading to a tumour growth delay time of 50  days. Similar results were found in CA 20948 tumour-bearing <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> small tumours after therapy (cumulative injected activity 7.7 [*]±[*] 0.4  MBq); a delay in tumour growth of around 30  days {{was observed}}, {{and in one of}} the animals, no tumour regrowth was observed. The delay time was estimated excluding the <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> cure or stable disease. In H 69 tumour-bearing <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> small tumours, a delay of tumour growth was found for around 30  days after therapy (cumulative injected activity 7.4 [*]±[*] 0.5  MBq), and in two animals, no tumour regrowth was observed {{until the end of the}} study at day 90. Here, the two <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> cure/stable disease were excluded from the estimated delay time.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} a wide panel of antigens of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) to select candidates for the diagnosis of paratuberculosis (PTB). A total of 54 recombinant proteins were spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and exposed to sera from <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> PTB (), healthy <b>animals</b> (), and <b>animals</b> experimentally infected <b>with</b> M. bovis (). This initial screening allowed us to select seven antigens: MAP 2513, MAP 1693, MAP 2020, MAP 0038, MAP 1272, MAP 0209 c, and MAP 0210 c, which reacted <b>with</b> sera from <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> PTB and showed little cross-reactivity with sera from healthy animals and <b>animals</b> experimentally infected <b>with</b> M. bovis. The second step was to evaluate the antigen cocktail of these seven antigens by ELISA. For this evaluation, we used sera from <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> PTB (), healthy <b>animals</b> (), and <b>animals</b> experimentally infected <b>with</b> M. bovis (). Using ELISA, the cocktail of the seven selected MAP antigens reacted with sera from 18 of the 25 <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> PTB and did not exhibit cross-reactivity <b>with</b> healthy <b>animals</b> and only low reactivity <b>with</b> <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> bovine tuberculosis. The combined application of these antigens could form part of a test which may help in the diagnosis of PTB...|$|R
5|$|As a ceratopsid, Achelousaurus {{would have}} been a quadrupedal <b>animal</b> <b>with</b> hoofed digits and a shortened, {{downwards}} swept tail. Its very large head, which would have rested on a straight neck, had a hooked upper beak, very large nasal openings and long tooth rows developed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of appressed and stacked individual teeth. In the tooth sockets, new teeth grew under the old ones, each position housing a column of teeth posed on top of each other. Achelousaurus had 25 to 28 such tooth positions in each maxilla (upper jaw bone).|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{its closest}} wild cousins (the coyote and golden jackal), the gray wolf is larger and heavier, with a broader snout, shorter ears, a shorter torso and longer tail. It is a slender, powerfully built <b>animal</b> <b>with</b> a large, deeply {{descending}} ribcage, a sloping {{back and a}} heavily muscled neck. The wolf's legs are moderately longer than those of other canids, which enables the animal to move swiftly, and allows it to overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range. The ears are relatively small and triangular. Females tend to have narrower muzzles and foreheads, thinner necks, slightly shorter legs and less massive shoulders than males.|$|E
5|$|Despite its feathers, most palaeontologists do not {{consider}} Sinosauropteryx to be birds. Phylogenetically, the genus is only distantly related to the clade Aves, usually defined as Archaeopteryx lithographica plus modern birds. The scientists who described Sinosauropteryx, however, used a character-based, or apomorphic, definition of the Class Aves, in which any <b>animal</b> <b>with</b> feathers {{is considered to be}} a bird. They argued that the filamentous plumes of Sinosauropteryx represent true feathers with a rachis and barbs, and thus that Sinosauropteryx should be considered a true bird. They classified the genus as belonging to a new biological order, Sinosauropterygiformes, family Sinosauropterygidae, within the subclass Sauriurae. These proposals have not been accepted, and Sinosauropteryx is generally classified in the family Compsognathidae, a group of small-bodied long-tailed coelurosaurian theropods known from the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous of Asia, Europe, and South America.|$|E

5|$|For others, {{although}} the hunting of <b>animal</b> <b>with</b> hounds was made illegal by the Hunting Act 2004, the Exmoor hunts still meet in full regalia {{and there is}} a campaign to resurrect this rural sport. Nine hunts cover the area– the Devon and Somerset Staghounds and the Quantock Staghounds, the Exmoor, Dulverton West, Dulverton Farmers and West Somerset Foxhounds, the Minehead Harriers, the West Somerset Beagles and the North Devon Beagles. During the spring, amateur steeplechase meetings (point-to-points) are run by hunts at temporary courses such as Bratton Down and Holnicote. These, along with thoroughbred racing and pony racing, are an opportunity for farmers, hunt staff and the public to witness a day of traditional country entertainment.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the known}} Ankylosaurus {{specimens}} were not scientifically described at length, though several paleontologists planned to do so, until Carpenter redescribed the genus in 2004. Carpenter noted that Ankylosaurus has become the archetypal member of its group, and the best known ankylosaur in popular culture, perhaps due to a life-sized reconstruction of the animal being featured at the 1964 World's Fair in New York City. Many traditional popular depictions show Ankylosaurus in a squatting posture and with a huge tail club being dragged over the ground. Modern reconstructions show the <b>animal</b> <b>with</b> a more upright limb posture and with the tail held off the ground. Likewise, large spines projecting sideways from the body (similar to those of nodosaurs) are present in many traditional depictions, but are not known from Ankylosaurus itself.|$|E
5|$|The Javan {{rhinoceros}} is {{a solitary}} <b>animal</b> <b>with</b> {{the exception of}} breeding pairs and mothers with calves. They sometimes congregate in small groups at salt licks and mud wallows. Wallowing in mud is a common behavior for all rhinos; the activity allows them to maintain cool body temperatures and helps prevent disease and parasite infestation. The Javan rhinoceros does not generally dig its own mud wallows, preferring to use other animals' wallows or naturally occurring pits, which it will use its horn to enlarge. Salt licks are also very important because of the essential nutrients the rhino receives from the salt. Male home ranges are larger at ²) compared to the female, which are around ²). Male territories overlap each other less {{than those of the}} female. It is not known if there are territorial fights.|$|E

5|$|The broad, heavily calcified {{jaws and}} nearly {{terminal}} mouth, combined with robust, serrated teeth, enable the tiger shark {{to take on}} these large prey. In addition, excellent eyesight and acute sense of smell enable it to react to faint traces of blood and follow them to the source. The ability to pick up low-frequency pressure waves enables the shark to advance towards an <b>animal</b> <b>with</b> confidence, even in murky water. The shark circles its prey and studies it by prodding it with its snout. When attacking, the shark often eats its prey whole, although larger prey are often eaten in gradual large bites and finished over time.|$|E
5|$|The {{giant otter}} is an {{especially}} noisy <b>animal,</b> <b>with</b> a complex repertoire of vocalizations. All otters produce vocalizations, but by frequency and volume, the giant otter {{may be the most}} vocal. Duplaix identified nine distinct sounds, with further subdivisions possible, depending on context. Quick hah barks or explosive snorts suggest immediate interest and possible danger. A wavering scream may be used in bluff charges against intruders, while a low growl is used for aggressive warning. Hums and coos are more reassuring within the group. Whistles may be used as advance warning of nonhostile intent between groups, although evidence is limited. Newborn pups squeak to elicit attention, while older young whine and wail when they begin to participate in group activities. An analysis published in 2014 cataloged 22 distinct types of vocalization in adults and 11 in neonates.|$|E
5|$|The least weasel {{was given}} its {{scientific}} name Mustela nivalis by Carl Linnaeus in his 12th edition of Systema Naturae in 1766. The type locality was Westrobothnia in Sweden.

The species was reviewed by Reichstein in 1957 and again by van Zyll de Jong in 1992 and Reig in 1997. Youngman (1982) placed it in the subgenus Mustela while Abramov (1999) considered it {{should be included in}} the subgenus Gale. Based on skull characteristics, Reig (1997) proposed that the taxon should be split into four species, M. subpalmata, M. rixosa, M. vulgaris and M. eskimo. Abrimov and Baryshinikov (2000) disagreed, recognising only M. subpalmata as a separate species.|$|E

40|$|Objective-To {{determine}} prevalence, {{reason for}} evaluation, treatment, and outcome for {{dogs and cats}} with presumed solitary ocular lymphoma (PSOL). Design-Retrospective case series. Animals- 7 dogs and 2 cats with PSOL. Procedures-Medical records were reviewed. Progression-free survival time (PFST) and overall survival time (OST) were determined. Results-Animals with intraocular (4 dogs and 1 cat) or conjunctival (3 dogs and 1 cat) lymphoma represented 0. 1 % and 0. 08 % of patients with lymphoma evaluated at the hospital during the study period, respectively. <b>Animals</b> <b>with</b> intraocular lymphoma represented 0. 19 % of all patients <b>with</b> uveitis; <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> conjunctival lymphoma represented 0. 16 % of all patients with conjunctivitis. Tumors included B-cell (2 intraocular and 1 conjunctival), non-B-cell, non-T-cell (1 intraocular), and T-cell (3 conjunctival) neoplasms; immunophenotype of 2 uveal lymphomas was not determined. Treatments included enucleation (4 intraocular) and chemotherapy (3 intraocular and 2 conjunctival). All dogs with intraocular lymphoma developed neurologic signs. Lymph node metastasis was detected in 2 patients with conjunctival lymphoma. Median PFST and OST were 178 days for all <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> PSOL, dogs <b>with</b> PSOL, and <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> intraocular lymphoma. Median PFST and OST for <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> conjunctival lymphoma were 221 and 549 days, respectively. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results indicated PSOL was uncommon, but {{should be considered a}} differential diagnosis for <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> uveitis or conjunctivitis.

Prognosis seemed to be better for <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> conjunctival lymphoma than it was for those with intraocular lymphoma...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundGenomic {{prediction}} for novel traits, {{which can}} be costly and labor-intensive to measure, is often hampered by low accuracy due to the limited size of the reference population. As an option to improve prediction accuracy, we introduced a semi-supervised learning strategy known as the self-training model, and applied this method to genomic prediction of residual feed intake (RFI) in dairy cattle. MethodsWe describe a self-training model that is wrapped around a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, which enables it to use data from <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> and without measured phenotypes. Initially, a SVM model was trained using data from 792 <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> measured RFI phenotypes. Then, the resulting SVM was used to generate self-trained phenotypes for 3000 animals for which RFI measurements were not available. Finally, the SVM model was re-trained using data from up to 3792 <b>animals,</b> including those <b>with</b> measured and self-trained RFI phenotypes. ResultsIncorporation of additional <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> self-trained phenotypes enhanced the accuracy of genomic predictions {{compared to that of}} predictions that were derived from the subset of <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> measured phenotypes. The optimal ratio of <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> self-trained phenotypes to <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> measured phenotypes (2. 5, 2. 0, and 1. 8) and the maximum increase achieved in prediction accuracy measured as the correlation between predicted and actual RFI phenotypes (5. 9, 4. 1, and 2. 4 %) decreased as the size of the initial training set (300, 400, and 500 <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> measured phenotypes) increased. The optimal number of <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> self-trained phenotypes may be smaller when prediction accuracy is measured as the mean squared error rather than the correlation between predicted and actual RFI phenotypes. ConclusionsOur results demonstrate that semi-supervised learning models that incorporate self-trained phenotypes can achieve genomic prediction accuracies that are comparable to those obtained with models using larger training sets that include only <b>animals</b> <b>with</b> measured phenotypes. Semi-supervised learning can be helpful for genomic prediction of novel traits, such as RFI, for which the size of reference population is limited, in particular, when the animals to be predicted and the animals in the reference population originate from the same herd-environment...|$|R
