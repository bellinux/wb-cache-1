5|$|The future Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith {{served in}} the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War, {{interrupting}} his studies at Rhodes University in South Africa to join up in 1941. Following a year's pilot instruction in Southern Rhodesia under the Empire Air Training Scheme, he was posted to No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron, then stationed in the Middle East, in late 1942. Smith received six weeks' operational training in the Levant, then entered active service as a pilot officer in Iran and Iraq. No. 237 Squadron, which had operated in the Western Desert from 1941 to early 1942, returned to that front in March 1943. Smith flew in the Western Desert until October that year, when a crash during a night takeoff resulted in serious injuries, including facial disfigurements <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> jaw. Following reconstructive plastic surgery to his face, other operations and five months' convalescence, Smith rejoined No. 237 Squadron in Corsica in May 1944. While there, he attained his highest rank, flight lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|Fernando Alonso {{became the}} first man to win two races in 2012 at the European Grand Prix in Valencia, scoring his first home win since the 2006 Spanish Grand Prix. Starting eleventh, he was forced to {{navigate}} his way through traffic, narrowly avoiding early contact between Bruno Senna and Kamui Kobayashi as Sebastian Vettel broke free of the field to establish a twenty-second lead by the first round of stops. Vettel's lead was quashed when Heikki Kovalainen and Jean-Éric Vergne made contact, triggering the deployment of the safety car to clear debris from the circuit. Alonso found himself third at the restart and pounced on a mistake by second-placed Romain Grosjean to lead the chase against Vettel. Vettel pulled away once more, but his lead was short-lived as he lost drive and his engine shut down on lap 33. Grosjean attempted to challenge Alonso, but was forced out of the race with an alternator problem seven laps later, leaving Alonso in the lead, four seconds clear of Lewis Hamilton and Kimi Räikkönen. As the race entered the final laps, Räikkönen forced his way past Hamilton to secure second place, but Pastor Maldonado's attempts to take third place ended with Hamilton in the barrier <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> nose for the Williams driver. Maldonado finished tenth, but was given a post-race drive-through penalty and was classified twelfth. Meanwhile, Michael Schumacher and Mark Webber had started to carve their way through the field by virtue of a late pit stop and easily picked off the minor points positions and taking advantage of the Maldonado—Hamilton collision to finish third and fourth behind Alonso and Räikkönen. It was Schumacher's first podium since the 2006 Chinese Grand Prix. Alonso's win cemented a twenty-point lead in the championship, whilst Vettel's retirement relegated him to fourth overall, twenty-six points behind Alonso.|$|E

5|$|Fischer {{lived for}} a time in Japan. On July 13, 2004, acting in {{response}} to a letter from U.S. officials, Japanese immigration authorities arrested him at Narita International Airport near Tokyo for allegedly using a revoked U.S. passport while trying to board a Japan Airlines flight to Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, Philippines. Fischer resisted arrest, and claimed to have sustained bruises, cuts <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> tooth in the process. At the time, Fischer had a passport (originally issued in 1997 and updated in 2003 to add more pages) that, according to U.S. officials, had been revoked in November 2003 due to his outstanding arrest-warrant for the Yugoslavia sanctions violation. Despite the outstanding arrest-warrant in the U.S., Fischer said that he believed the passport was still valid. The authorities held Fischer at a custody center for 16 days before transferring him to another facility. Fischer claimed that his cell was windowless and he had not seen the light of day during that period, and that the staff had ignored his complaints about constant tobacco smoke in his cell.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1987–88 season Vanbiesbrouck {{was hit by}} a puck {{under his}} mask in practice, which caused a non-displaced {{fracture}} of his lower jaw <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> tooth. Fortunately for him the injury did not require his jaw to be wired shut, {{and he was able to}} return to practice the next day. He showed no ill effects from the injury, playing in 56 games, winning 27. On June 13, 1988 Vanbiesbrouck suffered nerve damage to his left wrist after a glass coffee table he was sitting on collapsed and broken glass lacerated his ulnar nerve and three tendons. He was sitting on the table assembling video equipment in anticipation of the birth of his first child. The glass broke beneath him, and as he braced for the fall, his wrist was cut by the glass. Vanbiesbrouck required five hours of microsurgery to remove glass from his wrist and repair the nerve and tendon damage. He was initially expected to miss 4–6 months, but he recovered in time to attend the Rangers pre-season training camp just 3 months later. Again he played in 56 games, and increased his win total to 28.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a single}} fatality, 31-year-old Mosotho man Leshomo Makhaola, who died when a wall of an old mining house {{collapsed}} on him in Kanana, North West. An ER24 spokesperson said that miners had reportedly been trapped in 11 mine shafts at a mine in Orkney; however, subsequent inspections revealed that the miners at that location were safe. All 3,300 AngloGold Ashanti miners underground at its Great Noligwa and Moab Khotsong mines near Orkney {{had been brought to}} the surface by 19:30 SAST on 5August, including 34 who had been injured. All 34 miners were treated for minor injuries, including lacerations, contusions <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> leg, and discharged from hospital on 6August. AngloGold Ashanti management had proceeded with the evacuation after their temporarily interrupted power supply was mostly restored, mine management had contacted the mine crew underground by telephone and mine engineers had ensured that the shaft infrastructure was in working order. AngloGold Ashanti emergency medical staff had treated injured miners, and counsellors had treated some employees for shock. Mining operations at their Great Noligwa and Moab Khotsong mines were subsequently suspended pending safety checks.|$|E

5|$|Besides Chris Candido {{suffering}} a leg injury during his tag team match, Abyss also suffered a dislocated shoulder during {{the main event}} against A.J. Styles.

Candido had an operation on April 25 to have a plate, screws, and pins placed in his ankle to fix the problem. Candido was reported to be sidelined for 2 to 3 months. According to reports, Candido suffered the injury from taking a dropkick by Sonny Siaki and landing on his leg improperly. After the surgery, he hoped to be recovered in 6 to 8 weeks. On April28, Candido {{was rushed to the hospital}} after he collapsed where he died a short time later. Cause of death was released by his brother Johnny afterwards as a blood clot due to the surgery a few days prior. TNA released a public statement on April29 regarding the subject. TNA paid tribute to Candido on the April29 episode of Impact! as well as at TNA's Hard Justice PPV event. The April29 episode of Impact! opened and ended with a memorial to Candido.
