5000|$|Kathleen Collins (March 18, 1942 - September 18, 1988) (also {{known as}} Kathleen Conwell, Kathleen Conwell Collins or Kathleen Collins Prettyman) was an African-American playwright, writer, filmmaker, director, civil rights activist, and {{educator}} from Jersey City, New Jersey. Her two feature narratives—The Cruz Brothers and Miss Malloy (1980) and Losing Ground (1982)—furthered {{the range of}} Black women's films. Although Losing Ground was denied large-scale exhibition, it {{was among the first}} films created by a Black woman deliberately designed to tell a story intended for popular consumption, with a feature-length narrative structure.

40|$|Background: In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates {{clinical}} trials. These regulations address good clinical practices <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>human</b> <b>subject</b> protection (FDA, 2012). One of {{the most}} important legal and ethical concerns in clinical trials is informed consent. 21 CFR 50 governs <b>human</b> <b>subjects</b> research. Part 50. 24 provides an emergency research exception to the informed consent requirement. Research was conducted to determine the appropriateness of this exception, whether the benefit justifies the exception, and its public health significance. ^ Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted and articles were identified from peer-reviewed journals. ^ Results: There is some variance in opinions regarding the appropriateness of the exception, but the literature reviewed found the study results of these trials justified the waiver. ^ Conclusion: The exception to the informed consent requirement is likely appropriate and justified in emergency research when implemented within the specified guidelines. ...|$|R

50|$|Gérard Rabinovitch has deepened and fleshed-out his {{inquiry into}} the ethics of disillusionment through his {{analyses}} of humor, which he sees as a veritable jewel produced {{by the work of}} our culture (Kulturarbeit). In his book, Comment ça va mal? L’humour juif, un art de l’esprit, he explores the specificity of Jewish humor, that symbol of and testimony to the existence of a specifically Jewish culture and identity, which is situated between anthropological disillusionment and messianic hope. In his second work on the subject, Et vous trouvez ça drôle?!...variations sur le propre de l’homme, Gérard Rabinovitch pursues his reflection on humor and its ethical vocation, that of the benediction: i.e., the well-said. Analyzing the differences and similarities between the two great humorous traditions, Jewish humor and British humor, Gérard Rabinovitch throws light on the conditions that make humor possible and analyzes its civilizing effects and how it emancipates us with its lucidity. Through his research which seeks to articulate radical psychoanalytical anthropology with the recurring problems of classical political philosophy as posed by thinkers like Leo Strauss and Claude Lefort, Gérard Rabinovitch sets out new epistemological and ethical bases for us to assume our responsibilities <b>as</b> <b>human</b> <b>subjects</b> in the world.|$|E
50|$|The key concept {{inside the}} perceptual model is Idealisation. The idea behind this is, that POLQA is {{supposed}} to simulate Absolute Category Rating (ACR) tests. In an ACR test however, subjects have no comparison to the actual reference signal when they score a speech signal. Instead, {{it is assumed that}} subjects have an understanding of what an ideal signal sounds like and they use this as their own reference. Consequently, if they are asked to score a reference signal which is not absolutely perfect (e.g. it has the wrong volume or contains too much timbre, noise or reverberation), it will be scored worse than perfect. In its idealization step POLQA therefore corrects small imperfections of the reference signals in order to derive the same ideal reference for the comparison to the degraded signal <b>as</b> <b>human</b> <b>subjects</b> would use in their minds. Similar to the idealization of the reference signal, some distortions present in the degraded signal which are hardly perceptible in an ACR test will be partially compensated (e.g. small pitch shifts, linear frequency distortions). The perceptual model starts with scaling the reference signal to an ideal average active speech level of approximately -26dBov. No such scaling is performed on the degraded signal. It is assumed that any deviation of the level of the degraded signal from the ideal -26dBov is to be scored as a degradation of the signal. Next, the spectra of both signals are computed using an FFT with 50% overlapping frames with a duration of between 32ms and 43ms duration (depending on the sample rate). Subsequently small pitch shifts of the degraded signal will be eliminated (Frequency Dewarping). Now, the spectra will be transformed to a psychoacoustically motivated pitch scale, by combining individual spectral lines (FFT bins) to so-called critical bands. The pitch scale used is similar to the Bark scale with an average resolution of 0.3 Bark per band. The result is the Pitch Power Density. At this stage the first three distortion indicators for frequency response distortions, additive noise and room reverberations are calculated.After this, the excitation of each band is derived. This includes the modeling of masking effects in the frequency {{as well as in the}} temporal domain. The result is for each frame of each signal a head-internal representation which indicates roughly how loud each frequency component would be perceived.Now, a further idealization step of the reference signal takes place by filtering out excessive timbre and low level stationary noise. At the same time, linear frequency distortions and stationary noise are partially removed from the degraded signal.A subtraction of the idealized excitations finally leads to the Distortion Density, which is measure for the audibility of distortions.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of who is a humansubject of research has receivedincreased attention, particularly for genetic research and other studies involving the family or social net-works of primary subjects. 1 In the United States, {{questions have been raised}} about whether “third parties” meet the federal regulatory definition of a human subject, 2 thereby trigger-ing the requirement that they give consent to participate unless an Institutional Review Board (IRB) grants a waiver of consent. Yet classi-fying family members of research sub-jects or other third parties <b>as</b> <b>human</b> <b>subjects</b> of research might impede the research process by making it prohibi-tively costly and could raise attendant ethical concerns. 3 In this article, we explore the issue of whether and at what point the caregivers of patient/subjects in clinical trials become human sub-jects of research.
