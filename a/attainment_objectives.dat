40|$|Extensive {{literature}} {{has shown that}} student attainment outcomes are affected by schools’ decisions to alter student-to-teacher ratios and overall teacher aptitude levels. However, these findings provide little information to policymakers and school administrators for understanding which teacher input decision provides the greatest student attainment return relative to the associated costs. This study estimates cost-effective teacher input strategies for U. S. high schools seeking to either increase graduation rates or four-year college attendance rates by graduating students. Empirical results indicate that reducing student-to-teacher ratios is the most cost-effective teacher input decision for high schools seeking to improve graduation rates. However, for schools {{whose objective is to}} increase four-year college attendance rates, it is more cost-effective to allocate funds to improving teacher quality levels. These results put into question policies such as class size reduction mandates, which disregard schools’ student <b>attainment</b> <b>objectives</b> and institute generalized teacher hiring constraints. ...|$|E
40|$|Foreign {{language}} (FL) {{learning for}} younger learners, in instructional settings, {{is an international}} phenomenon and classroom-based assessment is often implied in primary curricula which conform to an objectives model of learning, privileging precise skill measurement and, in some contexts, formal reporting of outcomes (Shepard, 2000). However, classroom-based, formative assessment of FLs in younger learner contexts is problematic. A dearth of empirical evidence relating to early, limited input FL settings means that FL policy (and therefore <b>attainment</b> <b>objectives)</b> are formulated with “limited {{knowledge and understanding of}} teaching practices in the field of young learners” (Copland & Garton, 2014; Garton, Copland & Burns, 2011 : 1). This is evident, for example, in England where the National Curriculum (2014) recommends targets grounded in a four skills model (speaking, listening, reading and writing) which are not informed by any evidence concerning whether these might be achievable in the time available. This paper will discuss how teachers, practising in primary school FL classrooms, might develop practical and practicable formative assessment tools. Whilst this study concerned the teaching and learning of French in English primary schools (learners aged 9 - 11 years; n= 45), it nevertheless provides some evidence of short-term linguistic outcomes and classroom-based assessment in early language learning settings. Findings have the potential to contribute to the exploration of delivering classroom-based, formative language assessment in a range of FL primary school settings. <br/...|$|E
