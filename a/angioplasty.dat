5|$|Treatment {{is focused}} on {{reducing}} stroke episodes and damage from a distending artery. Four treatment modalities {{have been reported in}} the treatment of vertebral artery dissection. The two main treatments involve medication: anticoagulation (using heparin and warfarin) and antiplatelet drugs (usually aspirin). More rarely, thrombolysis (medication that dissolves blood clots) may be administered, and occasionally obstruction may be treated with <b>angioplasty</b> and stenting. No randomized controlled trials have been performed to compare the different treatment modalities. Surgery is only used in exceptional cases.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{majority}} of cases of stenosis or occlusion of central veins {{are the result of}} central catheters, arteriovenous fistulas, neoplasms or traumas and these conditions can cause severe cases of venous hypertension or reduce the flow through fistulas. The objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the results of central venous <b>angioplasties</b> conducted at our hospital. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a retrospective and descriptive study to analyze the results of central venous <b>angioplasties</b> conducted from 2010 to 2012 at a university hospital run by the Universidade Estadual de Londrina, Brazil. We calculated primary and secondary success rates and analyzed whether or not stents were used and complications occurred during a 6 -month follow-up period. RESULTS: A total of 25 central venous <b>angioplasties</b> were conducted. Twenty-four (96 %) of these were because of catheter-related intimal hyperplasia and one was to treat the effects of compression by a tumor. Fifteen (60 %) <b>angioplasties</b> were to correct stenosis and ten (40 %) were because of occlusions, with a one-hundred percent success rate for all stenosis-related procedures. However, none of the cases of occlusion could be treated endovascularly. Patency during the 6 -months follow-up period was 80 % after reinterventions. CONCLUSIONS: Despite good results observed after primary interventions for stenoses, it must be accepted that all current treatment options for chronic occlusive venous disease will, sooner or later, lead to restenosis or occlusion. Venous occlusions constitute a challenge demanding the development of new techniques and new materials. Prevention is paramount, through avoidance of central catheterization and early creation of arteriovenous fistulas...|$|R
5|$|The {{noble gases}} {{are used in}} excimer lasers, {{which are based on}} {{short-lived}} electronically excited molecules known as excimers. The excimers used for lasers may be noble gas dimers such as Ar2, Kr2 or Xe2, or more commonly, the noble gas is combined with a halogen in excimers such as ArF, KrF, XeF, or XeCl. These lasers produce ultraviolet light which, due to its short wavelength (193 nm for ArF and 248nm for KrF), allows for high-precision imaging. Excimer lasers have many industrial, medical, and scientific applications. They are used for microlithography and microfabrication, which are essential for integrated circuit manufacture, and for laser surgery, including laser <b>angioplasty</b> and eye surgery.|$|E
5|$|Before his death, in 1976 Blair bought O'Hara {{a travel}} magazine, the Virgin Islander, which {{she began to}} edit from their home {{for many years in}} St. Croix. She sold it in 1980 to USA Today {{to spend more time with}} her {{daughter}} and grandson Conor (born 1970). She passed on the airline business the following year, which by this time was chartering 120 flights a day with a fleet of 27 planes. O'Hara had had considerable prior experience with business as from the 1940s she ran a clothing store in Tarzana, Los Angeles, operating under her name, specializing in dresses for women. O'Hara increasingly spent time in Glengarriff on the southwest coast of Ireland, and established a golf tournament there in 1984 in her husband's memory. A hurricane in 1989 destroyed her home in St. Croix. While in New York, inquiring about the costs of rebuilding, she suffered six successive heart attacks and underwent an <b>angioplasty.</b> She moved permanently to Glengariff after suffering a stroke in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The first {{surgical}} {{intervention was}} performed by Norman Dott, who was a pupil of Harvey Cushing then working in Edinburgh. He introduced the wrapping of aneurysms in the 1930s, and was an early pioneer {{in the use of}} angiograms. American neurosurgeon Dr Walter Dandy, working in Baltimore, was the first to introduce clips in 1938. Microsurgery was applied to aneurysm treatment in 1972 in order to further improve outcomes. The 1980s saw the introduction of triple H therapy as a treatment for delayed ischemia due to vasospasm, and trials with nimodipine in an attempt to prevent this complication. In 1983, the Russian neurosurgeon Zubkov and colleagues reported the first use of transluminal balloon <b>angioplasty</b> for vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH. The Italian neurosurgeon Dr. Guido Guglielmi introduced his endovascular coil treatment in 1991.|$|E

40|$|A strong, lightweight, highly {{compliant}} Dacron surgical fabric of warp-knit, velour construction {{has been developed}} as an outgrowth of research on filamentous tubular vascular prostheses. This material has excellent suturability and conformability, high preclotting efficiency, and is imprinted with calibration marks at 2 cm intervals. Experimentally, iliac artery and descending thoracic aorta patch grafts of this material were completely healed 28 days after implantation in dogs. Light and electron microscopy showed excellent healing. This paper reports clinical results of 119 patches implanted in 109 patients who have been followed for a mean of 26. 4 months (range: 16 [...] 34 months). Of these, 20 patches were used in arterial reconstructions, and 99 {{were used in the}} heart for repair of 95 congenital and four acquired defects. The 20 patch <b>angioplasties</b> were performed in the carotid artery (four patches), subclavian artery, (one patch), common femoral artery, profunda femoris artery, or superficial femoral artery (10 patches), and in the popliteal artery (five patches).

25|$|An ECG {{that reveals}} ST segment {{elevation}} or new left bundle branch block suggests complete blockage {{of one of}} the main coronary arteries. These patients require immediate reperfusion (re-opening) of the occluded vessel. This can be achieved in two ways: thrombolysis (clot-busting medication) or percutaneous transluminal coronary <b>angioplasty</b> (PTCA). Both of these are effective in reducing significantly the mortality of myocardial infarction. Many centers are now moving to the use of PTCA as it is somewhat more effective than thrombolysis if it can be administered early. This may involve transfer to a nearby facility with facilities for <b>angioplasty.</b>|$|E
25|$|Reperfusion {{therapy is}} a medical {{treatment}} to restore blood flow, either through or around, blocked arteries, typically {{after a heart attack}} (myocardial infarction) (MI). Reperfusion therapy includes drugs and surgery. The drugs are thrombolytics and fibrinolytics used in a process called thrombolysis. Surgeries performed may be minimally-invasive endovascular procedures such as a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), followed by a coronary <b>angioplasty.</b> The <b>angioplasty</b> uses the insertion of a balloon to open up the artery, with the possible additional use of one or more stents. Other surgeries performed are the more invasive bypass surgeries that graft arteries around blockages.|$|E
