5|$|In the north, they {{hibernate}} {{during the}} winter. Niell (1947, 1948) made observations in Georgia, and noted {{they were one}} of the last species to seek shelter, often being found active until the first heavy frosts. At this point, they moved to higher ground and could be found in rotting pine stumps by tearing away the bark. These snakes could be quite active upon discovery and would then attempt to burrow more deeply into the soft wood or escape to the nearest water. In southeastern Virginia, Wood (1954) reported seeing migratory behavior in late October and early November. During a period of three or four days, as many as 50 individuals could be seen swimming <b>across</b> <b>Back</b> Bay from the bayside swamps of the barrier islands to the mainland. He suggested this might {{have something to do with}} hibernating habits. In the southern parts of its range, hibernation may be short or omitted altogether.|$|E

500|$|In early September, Washington began {{drawing up}} plans for two moves: first, to {{dispatch}} 1,000 men from Boston and invade Quebec, and second, {{to launch an}} attack on Boston. Washington felt that he could afford to send some troops to Quebec, as he had received intelligence from British deserters and American spies that the British {{had no intention of}} launching an attack from Boston until they were reinforced. [...] On September 11, about 1,100 troops under the command of Benedict Arnold left for Quebec. [...] Washington summoned a council of war, and made a case for an all out amphibious assault on Boston, by sending troops <b>across</b> <b>Back</b> Bay in flat-bottomed boats which could hold 50 men each. Washington believed it would be extremely difficult to keep the men together when winter came. In a war council, the plan was unanimously rejected, and the decision was not to attack [...] "for the present at least." ...|$|E

50|$|NAACP {{attorney}} Franklin Williams {{reported that}} each of the three surviving suspects stated, independently of the others, that he was beaten by Lake County deputies. Shepherd and Greenlee both told FBI agents that they confessed to the crime to stop the beatings. Despite the beatings, Irvin never confessed and continued to maintain his innocence. Williams cataloged the still visible evidence of their injuries. Shepherd’s injuries included: Scars on head, broken teeth, tooth puncture of upper lip, lash scars <b>across</b> <b>back</b> and chest, scars on the wrist, which supported Shepherd’s claim that he had been cuffed to a metal pipe. Irvin had similar injuries: Body scars, wide bruises, lash marks, scars across wrists, and right jaw appeared to be fractured. Charles Greenlee’s injuries included: Left eye was red and bruised, right cheekbone bore a double scar and scars around neck, groin area scarred, testicles swollen, numerous cuts on feet. Thurgood Marshall, a civil rights lawyer that worked for the NAACP, pressed the Justice Department and the FBI to initiate a civil rights and domestic violence investigation into the beatings of the boys. Marshall did manage to convince the Justice Department that the beatings violated the Groveland Boys' rights, and the FBI dispatched agents to investigate. The FBI later concluded that Lake County deputies James Yates and Leroy Campbell had violated the civil rights of the Groveland Boys and urged U.S. Attorney Herbert Phillips of Florida to prosecute, but a grand jury did not return indictments of the deputies.|$|E
5000|$|At the Battle of Long Island, in August of that year, Stirling led the stalwart, well-trained 1st Maryland Regiment (also {{known as}} the [...] "Maryland Line") in {{repeated}} attacks against a superior British Army force under command of Gen. William Howe at the Old Stone House near Gowanus Creek and took heavy casualties. The redcoats had made a wide flanking attack sweeping to the east through the lightly-guarded Jamaica Pass, {{one of a series}} of low entrances through the ridge line of hills running east to west through the center of Long Island, catching the Patriot forces on their left side. Outnumbered twenty-five to one, his brigade was eventually overwhelmed and Stirling himself was taken prisoner during the disciplined and measured retreat, but not before repelling the British forces long enough to allow the main body of Washington's Continental troops to escape to defensive positions at Brooklyn Heights, along the East River shoreline. Later, under the cover of a miraculous fog which enveloped the river, and the rear-guard covering actions of the Marylanders, Washington was able to barge his remaining troops and equipment <b>across</b> <b>back</b> to Manhattan Island and New York Town. Because of his actions at Long Island, one newspaper called Stirling [...] "the bravest man in America", and he was praised by both Washington and the British for his bravery and audacity. Later a commemorative monument was erected at the site of the military engagements and embattled retreat and the plot of land deeded to the State of Maryland near Prospect Park as a sacred parcel of [...] "blood-soaked Maryland soil".|$|E
