40|$|This paper {{examines}} the <b>provision</b> of <b>training</b> by employers and the participation in training by employees, conditional on employers´ <b>training</b> <b>provision.</b> Together these two dimensions of training determine its overall {{distribution in the}} workforce.

The {{results are consistent with}} high fixed costs but constant marginal costs of <b>training</b> <b>provision,</b> while also supporting many of the predictions regarding the relationship between training and workforce skills, skill-shortages, workplace and local labour market characteristics. ...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{expending}} a {{great deal}} of public money, and after many government-led âreformsâ to develop an apprenticeship system that rivals those found in other countries, the apprenticeship system in England still faces a number of challenges and failings, not least in the private training market. This paper explores the landscape of private <b>training</b> <b>provision</b> {{in the context of the}} most recent apprenticeship reforms and its implications for independent <b>training</b> <b>provision.</b> Reviewing the proposed shift from the provider-led to an employer-led system we suggest that the government is overestimating the readiness of industry to lead apprenticeships in England and will still rely heavily on private <b>training</b> <b>provision.</b> We propose that a high-quality system of apprenticeships requires refocusing from a single-actor-led to a multiple-actor-led system based on good relationships between âstrongâ actors with shared cost and responsibilities...|$|R
