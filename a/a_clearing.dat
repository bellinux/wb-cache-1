5|$|At {{a bend in}} the highway, {{there is}} a small patch of development, with a few houses near the highway. At the {{intersection}} with Township Road 529, State Route 664 enters Gallagher Township. Eventually, the large patch of forests in the surroundings come towards <b>a</b> <b>clearing,</b> where the highway intersects with Old Dirt Road. After crossing a stream, State Route 664 gains the moniker of the Coudersport Pike. The highway passes a small patch of development, reaching another clearing in the forest. After entering another forest, State Route 664 ends at an intersection with State Route 44 in the community of Haneyville.|$|E
5|$|Capital {{within the}} EU may be {{transferred}} in any amount {{from one country}} to another. All intra-EU transfers in euro are treated as domestic transactions and bear the corresponding domestic transfer costs. This includes all member states of the EU, even those outside the eurozone providing the transactions are carried out in euro. Credit/debit card charging and ATM withdrawals within the eurozone are also treated as domestic transactions; however paper-based payment orders, like cheques, have not been standardised so these are still domestic-based. The ECB has also set up <b>a</b> <b>clearing</b> system, TARGET, for large euro transactions.|$|E

After months of wading through swamps in the Amazon jungle, the search party finds the 90-year-old alive in <b>a</b> <b>clearing.</b> Lieber flies to San Cristóbal where he awaits the group's return with their captive. But getting the old man out of the jungle alive is more difficult than getting in, and their progress is further hampered by heavy thunderstorms.|$|E

5000|$|In Dianetics, {{to explain}} the {{abilities}} of <b>a</b> <b>Clear,</b> Hubbard makes use of tropes and special idioms and draws the attention away by pointing to old colloquialisms as the [...] "mind's eye." [...] Hubbard uses such terms as [...] "optimum recall," [...] "optimum individual," [...] "... What <b>a</b> <b>Clear</b> can do easily, {{quite a few people}} have, from time to time, been partially able to do in the past.," [...] "... <b>A</b> <b>clear</b> uses imagination in its entirety," [...] "... Rationality, as divorced from aberration, can be studied in <b>a</b> <b>Cleared</b> person only," [...] <b>a</b> <b>Clear's</b> intelligence is above normal, <b>a</b> <b>Clear</b> is free from all aberrations and the attributes of <b>a</b> <b>Clear</b> have never been previously included in a study of man and man's inherent abilities. After faithfully enumerating all kinds of goodies about Clear, Hubbard finally admits [...] "... Until we obtain Clears, it remains obscure why such differences should exist" [...] as if no Clear has ever been made or no Clear ever made it. L. Ron Hubbard was extremely apt and able in using these tropes to suit Dianetics presentation of a new reality.|$|R

5|$|The name Sheffield is Old English in origin. It {{derives from}} the River Sheaf, whose name is a {{corruption}} of shed or sheth, meaning to divide or separate. Field is a generic suffix deriving from the Old English feld, meaning a forest clearing. It is likely then that {{the origin of the}} present-day city of Sheffield is an Anglo-Saxon settlement in <b>a</b> <b>clearing</b> beside the confluence of the rivers Sheaf and Don founded between the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons in this region (roughly the 6th century) and the early 9th century.|$|E

In <b>a</b> <b>clearing,</b> Link finds a woman encircled by monsters. When the monsters see Link, they scatter in all directions. The woman is Princess Zelda's nurse, Impa, who asks Link to help her find a singer in the forest. Continuing through the forest, the two find Nayru, a young woman with blue hair singing on a tree stump, {{surrounded}} by forest creatures. A shadow emerges from Impa and reveals itself as Veran, Sorceress of Shadows. Veran soars into Nayru's body and possesses her. Nayru was the Oracle of Ages; her abduction causes a disruption in the time flow of Labrynna.|$|E

They would be responsible for defending an area from the Château Saint Come, across <b>a</b> <b>clearing</b> in the woods, to a house known as the Bois de Mont. To their front was a stretch of open land leading to Bréville-les-Monts and the road from Amfreville to Le Mesnil-les-Monts.

5|$|Moving {{up to the}} {{national}} junior team, Getzlaf made his first of two appearances at the World Junior Hockey Championship in 2004. He recorded six points in six games for a Canadian squad that scored 25 goals in its four round-robin games and surrendered only four {{en route to a}} gold medal showdown with the United States. With Canada leading 3–1 early in the third period of the final, both Getzlaf and Sidney Crosby failed to capitalize on opportunities to add an extra goal that may have sealed a victory. Instead, Canada surrendered the lead, and Getzlaf and his teammates were forced to settle for the silver medal after goaltender Marc-André Fleury accidentally sent <b>a</b> <b>clearing</b> pass off a teammate and into his own net for the game-winning goal.|$|E
5|$|Potiorek {{planned to}} launch a {{converging}} attack across northern and western Serbia; the 5th Army was to capture Valjevo and envelope the Kolubara River from the north, and the 6th Army was to secure the Jagodnja plateau and outflank Serbian units on the Kolubara from the south. The capture of the southeastern Serbian city of Niš was Potiorek's main objective; Niš had been Serbia's capital since July and was a crucial transportation hub for its military. It also acted as <b>a</b> <b>clearing</b> house for munitions produced at the arsenal in nearby Kragujevac. The city's capture would effectively cut Serbia in two and scatter the Serbian Army.|$|E

After <b>a</b> <b>clearing,</b> the highway enters the dense forest completely and turns to the southeast.|$|E

A flourishing scene of clubs and groups emerged in the later 1950s and 1960s and bands began to break through into mainstream success. Major acts included the Rolling Stones, Manfred Mann, The Animals, The Yardbirds, Them, and the Spencer Davis Group, who dominated the UK and US charts from 1964, {{in the wake of}} the Merseybeat craze, becoming central to the mod subculture in the UK and a second wave of British Invasion acts in the US.|$|E
