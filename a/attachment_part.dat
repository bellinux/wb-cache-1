40|$|We {{present a}} case of medial head of {{gastrocnemius}} tendon tear. The type of injury widely {{reported in the literature}} is tear of the medial head of gastrocnemius muscle or ‘tennis leg’. We previously reported an isolated partial tear and longitudinal split of the tendon to the medial head of gastrocnemius at its musculotendinous junction. The case we now present has notable differences; the tear was interstitial and at the proximal (femoral <b>attachment)</b> <b>part</b> of the tendon, the patient’s symptoms and clinical examination suggested a medial meniscus tear, and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bone oedema at the tendon insertion site indicating a traction injury. Both cases suggest that isolated tear of the medial head of the gastrocnemius tendon may have a variety of presentations and appearances and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of tennis leg as well as medial meniscus tear...|$|E

At the beginning of this dissertation work, I try to introduce important theories that are related to the central concept. I also focus on how culture jamming most often express and what forms are most common. In the part of examples of culture jamming in the world, I try to describe the important foreign culture jamming's groups, including demonstrations of their actions and performances.

40|$|Journal Article: Transforming Government: People, Process and PolicyPurpose - The paper {{traces the}} {{trajectory}} of the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project, an electronic tolling programme based in South Africa, to argue {{for the importance of}} taking advantage of the public project opportunity to introduce the concept of Transformational Government (t-Government). Design/methodology/approach - The research employs an interpretive perspective and utilises Actor Network Theory (ANT) to understand the roles and interests of the various stakeholders within the project and assess how each stakeholder has influenced the project’s sustainability. Findings - The findings suggest that the attachment of global actors appears to be waning; and events support {{the idea that there is}} a moderate degree of mobilization of local actors, which is reducing. This allowed us to make a claim that the project remains solid and indispensable, even though there are ‘discordant’ voices in the local actor groups as well as waning global actor network <b>attachment.</b> <b>Part</b> of this claim is hinged on the view that the e-toll has become a visible technical artefact, which has managed to embody its own patterns of use characterised by various viewpoints, values, opinions and rhetoric. Practical implications - The paper elevates the opportunity of using the notion of t-Government as an extension of our understanding of factors influencing e-government such as public participation. We show that unless governments employ participatory approaches to similar programmes in future, they may jeopardize a critical requirement of t-Government namely the need for the service experience of stakeholders to continuously support participatory governance principles. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the research on the emerging discourse on t-Government. The paper also highlights the utility of ANT as a tool for understanding dynamic public sector e-government programmes, their associated complexities and unintended consequencesSchool of Computin...|$|E
40|$|The {{frequency}} of emergency incidents and the expanding spectrum {{of all possible}} mass casualties require preventive and safety precautions and fast professional respond to their occurrence. Emergency prevailing medical complication requests from Medical Rescue Service providers a different attendance to intervention than is usually requested in their daily routine activities. Daily routines of Medical Rescue Service providers include medical treatments {{of one or two}} patients using urgent care medicine methods, which present a full medical treatment to a particular patient from the first contact to their handing over to other medical services providers. In emergencies with mass casualties? incidence, it is impossible to attend one particular patient at a time, but it is necessary to adjust priorities in medical attendance to patients in dispatch and as well to transfer all patients to other medical service provider facilities. Shall there be an emergency with mass casualties, there are few concomitant circumstances in their solving, and these are: lack of time for decision making and rescue works co-ordination, panic, delay in treatment and transport of patients to other medical facilities. Especially at the rescue work start of all integrated rescue system units, forces and equipments are insufficient, as for example lack of professional medical staff, rescuer and medical equipment including medicaments. The ration of rescue forces and medical equipment to a number of patients optimizes in following process, when a successful outcome is conditioned by the rescue work in the first thirty to sixty minutes. It is, thus, very important to paying attention to the organization and control of rescue works of all integrated rescue units right from the start. An intergrated rescue system is mentioned in theoretical part of the thesis. On the strenght of valid legislation, the provider of Medical Rescue Service is generally described, particularly focused on preparedness and solving of emergency incidents by the Medical Rescue Service of South Bohemia. Furthermore, the organisation trauma plan,the START asset classification of casualties with the follow-up method using identification and sorting cards (medical classification) are described. The theoretical part of thesis is closed up by an outlined exterior emergency plan of the nuclear power plant Temelin with focus on its trauma plan related to the Medical Rescue Service of South Bohemia activities solving emergency situation in the connection with an outflow of radioactive substance. The thesis was written on the ground of a qualitative research using the method of a semi-led interview of seven superintendant medical doctors of Medical Rescue Service from different areas in South Bohemia. The content of the research was an evaluation of possible development and potentional changes in preparing and also consequential activities of medical units at emergency situations with mass casulties. Research questionaire was focused on competence and funcion of medical dispatching centre, establishing work process of first paramedics attending at the place of an emergency situation, also co-operation of medical units with other units of an integrated rescue system and as well the tie-in system to other medical facilities. The aim of the research was establishing hypotheses in terms of Medical Rescue Service of South Bohemia preparadness to solution of emergency situations. Created hypotheses attached to a chapter ¨Discussion¨ may be verified, in the future, by a quantitative research.

40|$|This thesis reports an ethnographic {{study of}} {{undergraduate}} nodical students at Edinburgh University, {{in their first}} year of clinical studies. It explores various aspects of their 'clinical experience' in the course of that year. The thesis is organized in four parts. Part I provides the context for the research. The conduct of the study is reported, and the methods used (participant observation, interviews and self-administered questionnaire) are discussed. The medical school, the undergraduate curriculum and the work of the fourth (first clinical) year are also outlined. Part II examines two major concepts - 'student culture' and 'professional segmentation'. The variety of medical and educational experiences that students encounter, and the students' understandings of segmentation within the medical school are examined. This part of the thesis also explores how students use their understanding of such diversity in organizing their own careers in the medical school. The argument is also illustrated with case studies of individual clinical <b>attachments.</b> <b>Part</b> III is focused on the social Interaction of clinical teaching - between doctors, students and patients. The management of clinical information in such encounters is discussed. The argument proceeds with a consideration of theconditions for the successful accomplishment of bedside teaching, and of contingencies which can undermine such accomplishment. Part IV develops the analysis begun in Parts II and III. The management of medical knowledge is analysed further: the 'classic case', 'clinical experience' and clinicians' appeals to indeterminate knowledge are documented. These topics are linked with the theme of Part II, as it is argued that divergencies in personal knowledge are grounded in processes of segmentation in the medical profession and the medical school. Thus the themes of 'professional segmentation' and 'clinical experience' are reunited in the concluding section of the thesis...|$|R
