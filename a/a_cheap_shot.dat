5000|$|However, Mann's {{comments}} were countered by the Reigate MP Crispin Blunt. He said: [...] "Helen has a substantial ministerial portfolio, constituents, a constituency {{and family responsibilities}} to manage. Her arrangements are not analogous to mine". [...] "These {{are part of the}} trade-offs that MPs and ministers have to make all the time to try to meet all the competing demands on them. Frankly, I think this is <b>a</b> pretty <b>cheap</b> <b>shot</b> by Dispatches and I would hope you would be sympathetic to someone who has done a considerable public service, by moving from a successful professional service business into public service at significant expense to herself and her family".|$|R

2500|$|On the June 11, 2012 {{episode of}} Raw, Slater began {{appearing}} in segments involving WWE veterans returning to Raw as a build-up to Raw's 1000th episode on July 23. 2012. In the segments, Slater {{would enter the}} ring and issue challenges to [...] "the so-called legends" [...] or [...] "any former WWE champion", which resulted in him losing a series of squash matches, with the first two losses to Vader and Sycho Sid. He was further humiliated in a comedic segment by Roddy Piper, Wendi Richter and Cyndi Lauper. He defeated Doink the Clown on the July 2, 2012 edition of Raw, but following the match, Diamond Dallas Page came to the ring and performed the Diamond Cutter on Slater.
