5|$|Khrushchev {{assisted}} in the purge of many friends and colleagues in Moscow oblast. Of 38top Party officials in Moscow city and province, 35 were killed—the three survivors were transferred {{to other parts of}} the USSR. Of the 146Party secretaries of cities and districts outside Moscow city in the province, only 10 survived the purges. In his memoirs, Khrushchev noted that <b>almost</b> <b>everyone</b> who worked with him was arrested. By Party protocol, Khrushchev was required to approve these arrests, and did little or nothing to save his friends and colleagues.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms of Huntington's disease most {{commonly}} become noticeable {{between the ages}} of 35 and 44years, but they can begin at any age from infancy to old age. In the early stages, there are subtle changes in personality, cognition, and physical skills. The physical symptoms are usually the first to be noticed, as cognitive and behavioral symptoms are generally not severe enough to be recognized on their own at the earlier stages. <b>Almost</b> <b>everyone</b> with Huntington's disease eventually exhibits similar physical symptoms, but the onset, progression and extent of cognitive and behavioral symptoms vary significantly between individuals.|$|E
5|$|Wacław Jędrzejewicz, in Piłsudski: A Life for Poland, {{describes}} Piłsudski as very deliberate in his decision-making. He collected {{all available}} pertinent information, then {{took his time}} weighing it before arriving at a final decision. Piłsudski drove himself hard, working all day and all night. He maintained a spartan lifestyle, eating plain meals alone at an inexpensive restaurant. Though Piłsudski was popular {{with much of the}} Polish public, his reputation as a loner (the result of many years' underground work), as a man who distrusted <b>almost</b> <b>everyone,</b> led to strained relations with other Polish politicians.|$|E

5|$|In late 1937, Stalin {{appointed}} Khrushchev {{as head of}} the Communist Party in Ukraine, and Khrushchev duly left Moscow for Kiev, {{again the}} Ukrainian capital, in January 1938. Ukraine had been the site of extensive purges, with the murdered including professors in Stalino whom Khrushchev greatly respected. The high ranks of the Party were not immune; the Central Committee of Ukraine was so devastated that it could not convene a quorum. After Khrushchev's arrival, the pace of arrests accelerated. All but one member of the Ukrainian Politburo Organizational Bureau and Secretariat were arrested. Almost all government officials and Red Army commanders were replaced. During the first few months after Khrushchev's arrival, <b>almost</b> <b>everyone</b> arrested received the death penalty.|$|E
5|$|In this way, much to Metternich's {{disappointment}} and to Franz Josef's embarrassment, Austria began the Second Italian War of Independence against the combined forces of Piedmont-Sardinia and its ally France. Though Metternich {{was able to}} secure the replacement of Buol with his friend Rechberg, who had helped him so much in 1848, involvement in the war itself was now beyond his capacity. Even a special task given him by Franz Josef in June 1859—to draw up secret papers addressing the event of Franz Josef's death—was now too taxing. Shortly afterwards Metternich died in Vienna on 11 June 1859, aged 86, and the last great figure of his generation. <b>Almost</b> <b>everyone</b> of note in Vienna came to pay tribute; in the foreign press his death went virtually unnoticed.|$|E

He is a complete idiot whose weakness is education; at one point, Takeyama is able to knock him out by reciting pi. He {{is not afraid to}} harm or kill anyone who gets in Yuri's way.

It was not until the dawn of 28 November that the 58th Division arrived at Hagaru-ri. Meanwhile, from the fighting and ambushes that had occurred the previous night, the garrison at Hagaru-ri noticed the Chinese forces around them. Lieutenant Colonel Thomas L. Ridge, commander of 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines (3/1), predicted the Chinese attack would come on the night of 28 November. <b>Almost</b> <b>everyone,</b> including rear support units with little combat training, was pressed into the front line due to the manpower shortage, and the entire perimeter was on full alert by 21:30.|$|E
5|$|Caroline's main rival for Mac's {{affections}} is Sue White (Michelle Gomez), the Scottish staff {{liaison officer}} employed {{to listen and}} respond to the problems of East Hampton's staff. However, Sue is perhaps the least suited person for the job; she is mean-spirited, insensitive, unsympathetic, controlling and vain. Her office is a place where the impossible tends to happen, and anyone who enters is normally treated with a mixture of verbal abuse and psychological torture, so she can get back to doing nothing, or thinking about how to upset the next visitor. The only person she treats with any affection is Mac, whom she loves to the point of madness, but Mac, like <b>almost</b> <b>everyone</b> else, tries his best to avoid her. Anyone who attempts to get involved with Mac is treated with contempt and hatred by Sue, in particular Caroline, whom Sue attempts several times to murder.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's small {{majority}} {{after the}} 1964 general election {{had made the}} transaction of government business difficult, and in 1966 he called another election in which Labour gained a strong working majority of 96. Some older members of Heath's team, including Lloyd, retired from the front bench, making room {{for members of the}} next generation. Heath moved Maudling to the foreign affairs portfolio, and Douglas-Home took over Lloyd's responsibilities as spokesman on Commonwealth relations. Heath was widely seen as ineffective against Wilson, and as the 1970 general election approached there was concern within the party that he would lose, and that Powell would seek to replace him as leader. Maudling and the chief whip, William Whitelaw, believed that if Heath had to resign Douglas-Home would be the safest candidate to keep Powell out. Douglas-Home shared their view that Labour would win the 1970 election, and that Heath might then have to resign, but he declined to commit himself. To the surprise of <b>almost</b> <b>everyone</b> except Heath, the Conservatives won the election, with a majority of 31 seats.|$|E
