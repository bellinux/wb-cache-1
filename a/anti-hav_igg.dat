40|$|AIM: To {{detect the}} {{prevalence}} of <b>anti-HAV</b> <b>IgG</b> antibodies in adult multitransfused beta-thalassemic patients. METHODS: We studied 182 adult beta-thalassemic patients and 209 controls matched for age and sex from the same geographic area, at the same time. <b>Anti-HAV</b> <b>IgG</b> antibodies, viral markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection were evaluated. RESULTS: <b>Anti-HAV</b> <b>IgG</b> antibodies were detected more frequently in thalassemic patients (133 / 182; 73. 1 %) than in healthy controls (38 / 209; 18. 2 %, P < 0. 0005). When we retrospectively evaluated {{the prevalence of}} <b>anti-HAV</b> <b>IgG</b> antibodies in 176 / 182 (96. 7 %) thalassemic patients, whose medical history was available for the previous ten years, {{it was found that}} 83 (47. 2 %) of them were continuously <b>anti-HAV</b> <b>IgG</b> positive, 16 (9. 1 %) acquired <b>anti-HAV</b> <b>IgG</b> antibody during the previous ten years, 49 (27. 8 %) presented anti-HAV positivity intermittently and 28 (15. 9 %) were anti-HAV negative continuously. CONCLUSION: Multitransfused adult beta-thalassemic patients present higher frequency of <b>anti-HAV</b> <b>IgG</b> antibodies than normal population of the same geographic area. This difference is difficult to explain, but it {{can be attributed to the}} higher vulnerability of thalassemics to HAV infection and to passive transfer of anti-HAV antibodies by blood transfusions...|$|E

In the present study we analyzed {{the changes in the}} seroprevalence of IgG anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV) over the past 13 years. MethodsOverall, 4903 subjects who visited our hospital between January 2001 and December 2013 were studied. The seroprevalence of <b>IgG</b> <b>anti-HAV</b> was analyzed according to age and sex. In addition, the seroprevalence of <b>IgG</b> <b>anti-HAV</b> was compared among 12 age groups and among the following time periods: early 2000 s (2001 - 2003), mid-to-late 2000 s (2006 - 2008), and early 2010 s (2011 - 2013). The chi-square test for trend was used for statistical analysis. ResultsThe seroprevalence of <b>IgG</b> <b>anti-HAV</b> did not differ significantly between the sexes. Furthermore, compared to the seroprevalence of <b>IgG</b> <b>anti-HAV</b> in the early 2000 s and mid-to-late 2000 s, that in the early 2010 s was markedly increased among individuals aged 1 - 14 years and decreased among those aged 25 - 44 years (P< 0. 01).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although several common {{community}} infections {{have been}} associated with the risk for coronary artery disease (CAD), their {{role in the development of}} acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is still unclear. We examined the prevalence of IgG and IgM (or IgA) antibodies against common infections such as HSV, Hepatitis A (HAV), Helicobacter pylori (HP), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP), in CAD and AMI patients, and their relationship with pro-atherogenic inflammatory molecules. METHODS: A total number of 337 subjects were included in this study: 150 patients with angiographically documented stable CAD, 138 patients admitted with AMI and 49 healthy individuals. Serum IgG and IgM against HAV, CMV and HSV, IgG against HP and IgG/IgA against CP were determined in all participants. Serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and soluble vascular cells adhesion molecule (sVCAM- 1), were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Patients with CAD were more likely to have <b>anti-HAV</b> <b>IgG</b> (94. 4 %), anti-HSV IgG (97. 2 %) and anti-HP IgG (55. 1 %) compared to healthy individuals (70. 8 %, 89. 6 % and 39. 6 % respectively, p< 0. 05 for all). In multivariate analysis, <b>anti-HAV</b> <b>IgG</b> was an independent predictor of CAD (beta(SE) : 0. 187 (0. 075), p= 0. 015). Among the CAD patients, the presence of anti-CP IgA was more frequent in those admitted with AMI (39 %) compared to those with stable CAD (21 %, p< 0. 05). Finally, both patients and controls had significantly higher levels of sVCAM- 1 and TNF-alpha in the presence of <b>anti-HAV</b> <b>IgG,</b> compared to those without <b>anti-HAV</b> <b>IgG</b> (p< 0. 05 for all). CONCLUSION: Past infections with HAV, HSV and HP are associated with higher risk for coronary atherosclerosis, while the presence of <b>anti-HAV</b> <b>IgG</b> is also associated with higher levels of TNF-alpha and sVCAM- 1. Furthermore, the presence of recent infection by CP is associated with higher risk for AMI among CAD patients. These findings are important since they demonstrate that past HAV, HSV and HP infections may affect cardiovascular risk, while recent CP infection may be implicated in the triggering of AMI among CAD patients...|$|E

40|$|Background: Autoimmune {{mechanisms}} and drugs used in treatment {{increase the risk}} of liver disease in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccination is important, especially in intermediate-endemicity areas like Turkey. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the immune response to hepatitis A vaccine and vaccine safety in children with JIA. Methods: This study was carried out in our hospital’s Pediatric Rheumatology outpatient clinic and Healthy Child clinic between the years 2003 and 2008. The study group consisted of 47 children with JIA (23 male and 24 female) diagnosed according to International League of Associations for Rheumatology diagnostic criteria. The control group consisted of 67 healthy children (31 female, 36 male) who did not have a history of hepatitis A infection or vaccination. Both groups were vaccinated with two doses of hepatitis A vaccine at 6 -month intervals. <b>Anti-HAV</b> <b>IgG</b> > 80  MIU was accepted as positive response.

40|$|Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is {{transmitted}} via the fecal-oral route from contaminated food or water. As {{part of the}} most recent survey of viral hepatitis burden in Thailand, we analyzed the current seroprevalence of HAV in the country and compared with data dating back to 1971. From March to October, 2014, a total of 4, 260 individuals between one month and 71 years of age from different geographical regions (North = 961; Central = 1, 125; Northeast = 1, 109; South = 1, 065) were screened for <b>anti-HAV</b> <b>IgG</b> antibody using an automated chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Overall, 34. 53 % (1, 471 / 4, 260) possessed <b>anti-HAV</b> <b>IgG</b> antibody, and the age-standardized seroprevalence was 48. 6 %. Seroprevalence rates were 27. 3 % (North), 30. 8 % (Central), 33. 8 % (Northeast) and 45. 8 % (South) and were markedly lower than in the past studies especially among younger age groups.

The overall prevalence among patients was 57 %, in women 59 % and 56 % in men. CONCLUSIONS Seroprevalence of anti-HAV antibodies declined in last decades in European countries. Inour study 20 % blood donors had antibodies anti-HAV in the group younger than 35 yearsand among patient only 15 % of patients had antibodies in the same group. The use of a vaccine against hepatitis A virus has to be considered for the prevention ofsymptomatic hepatitis, especially in adults at risk for infection, such as those who travel toareas with poor sanitation. Furthermore, they should take into consideration the fact thatthe severity of the disease increases with ag...|$|R
40|$|A {{modified}} micro solid-phase radioimmunoassay (RIA) for antibody to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) was developed. This double antibody {{procedure was}} performed by coating {{the surface of a}} polyvinyl microtiter plate "well" with 200 microliter of a 1 : 1, 000 dilution of a patient's test serum. Purified HAV and 125 I-labeled immunoglobulin G (<b>IgG)</b> <b>anti-HAV</b> were then sequentially added to form an antibody sandwich. The specificity and sensitivity of the RIA procedure for anti-HAV were verified by examination of coded human and chimpanzee serum specimens. Radioimmunoassay of early-acute-phase serum specimens from human cases of hepatitis A revealed the presence of anti-HAV activity. Differential examination by RIA of IgG and IgM fractions of acute-phase sera from experimentally infected chimpanzees demonstrated that IgM contained the bulk of the anti-HAV activity. A modification of the RIA procedure for anti-HAV (RIA-IgM blocking), incorporating an incubation step with anti-IgM (Mu chain specific), was further shown to differentiate acute- from convalescent-phase hepatitis A sera. This adapted RIA-IgM blocking procedure required less than 1 microliter of a single acute-phase serum specimen for the diagnosis of viral hepatitis A...|$|R
40|$|Diagnosis {{of acute}} {{hepatitis}} A virus (HAV) infection {{is based on}} the detection of HAV immunoglobulin M (IgM). However, IgM could be detected due to nonspecific polyclonal activation of the immune system. An avidity test for <b>anti-HAV</b> <b>IgG</b> was developed to distinguish acute infection, where low-avidity antibodies are detected, from immune reactivation. The assay was tested on 104 samples, including 11 sera from patients with past infection, 15 sera from patients with acute infection and 4 collected after recovery, 10 sera from vaccinated subjects, 4 sera from patients with suspected immune reactivation, and 60 unselected HAV-IgM positive sera, collected over 1 year in a routine laboratory. The avidity index (AI) was expressed as percentage. The results were provided as the mean ± one standard deviation. Patients with a history of prior infection had AIs of > 70 % (mean, 86 % ± 10), whereas the mean AI was 36 % ± 16 during acute HAV infection (P 70 % (88 % ± 10 %), a finding consistent with a prior infection. Among the 60 unselected sera, 35 (58 %) had a noncalculable or 70 %, and none was reverse transcription-PCR positive, suggesting immune reactivation. These 16 patients were significantly older than the others (50 ± 16 years versus 26 ± 14 years). The new <b>anti-HAV</b> <b>IgG</b> avidity assay we developed could improve HAV infection diagnosis, particularly in elderly patients...|$|E
40|$|Abstract = The {{age-specific}} anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV) seroprevalence {{rates in}} South Korea have changed markedly {{since the last}} 2030 years with an improvement in the socio-economic, housing, and environmental-sanitation conditions. These changes are characterized by very low anti-HAV seropositive rates among individuals less than 30 years of age; however, nowadays, most {{adolescents and young adults}} at an increased risk of developing symptomatic HAV infections. The Korea Center for Disease Control Sentinel Surveillance System has recently revealed an increase in the incidence of hepatitis A infection since 2001 and has revealed a potential endemic nature of the hepatitis A infection. Hepatitis A vaccines that were introduced in 1997 in Korea have made the current <b>anti-HAV</b> <b>IgG</b> positive rates in children (less than 10 years of age) approximately 50 % of the rates observed in Seoul in 2006. However, in the same year, a few children were diagnosed as having <b>anti-HAV</b> <b>IgG</b> antibodies in Busan. This suggests the presence of some difference in the vaccination policy among doctors practicing in Seoul and Busan. Thus, the current recommendation of vaccinating 12 -year-old child with HAV vaccination should be emphasized and a new strategy should be developed for the vaccination program to cater to the adolescents and young adults who are not immune, as well as for persons who are at a high risk for hepatitis A viral infection such as military personnel and hospital and day care center employees. Further, urgent hepatitis A vaccinations are also needed in patient...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) {{infection}} {{can cause}} fa­tal hepatitis particularly in pregnant women. In this study, it was aimed {{to investigate the}} rate of anti HEV IgG se­roprevalence in {{women of childbearing age}} and whether there are differences in seroprevalence among people liv­ing in urban and rural areas or not. Methods: A total of 158 women volunteers aged 15 - 49 years living in rural or urban areas were included in this study. Anti-HEV IgG antibodies were performed with en­zyme immunoassay method.

40|$|Objective—To {{evaluate}} {{the risk of}} hepati-tis A virus (HAV) infection among sewage workers from occupational exposure to raw sewage. Methods—An analytical cross sectional study of 241 company employees with pos-sible occupational exposure to sewage in a large water and sewerage company was carried out. Previous exposure to hepati-tis A virus infection was assessed, as were its associations with possible risk factors. Results—Frequent occupational exposure to raw sewage was a significant risk factor for HAV infection, independently of other known risk factors (odds ratio 3. 73, 95 % confidence interval 1. 48 to 9. 37). Of 50 employees who reported occupational ex-posure to raw sewage most of the time, 30 (60 %) had had HAV infection. Conclusion—Employees {{who are likely to}} be at risk of frequent exposure should have their immunity ensured. The salivary assay for <b>IgG</b> <b>anti-HAV</b> used in the study was highly specific and would be suitable for prevaccination testing of older employ-ees, who {{are more likely to be}} immune.

40|$|Background/Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the seroconversion rate of a hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccination in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) -related chronic liver disease (CLD). Methods: Analyses were conducted using clinical records from 94 patients with chronic HBV infection who were seronegative for <b>IgG</b> <b>anti-HAV</b> antibodies between September 2008 and June 2009. Two doses of an HAV vaccine were administered 24 weeks apart. A third vaccine dose was administered only for patients seronegative for anti-HAV antibodies at week 48. Results: The seroconversion rate of anti-HAV following the two-dose vaccination was 86. 17 %. The seroconversion rate of anti-HAV was not significantly different according to age or status of liver disease. The rate was higher in female than in male patients. A third HAV vaccine dose was administered to 13 patients seronegative for anti-HAV after the two-dose regimen, and 84. 62 % of these patients showed seroconversion at week 72. Conclusions: HAV vaccination is effective in most Korean patients with HBV-related CLD, and it might be necessary to evaluate three-dose vaccination approach for non-responders to the conventional regimen to maximize the success of an HAV vaccination program...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis B and A {{account for}} {{considerable}} {{morbidity and mortality}} worldwide. Immunization {{is the most effective}} means of preventing hepatitis B and A. However, the immune response to both hepatitis vaccines seems to be reduced in HIV-infected subjects. The aim of this review was to analyze the immunogenicity, safety, long-term protection and current recommendations of hepatitis B and A vaccination among HIV-infected adults. The factors most frequently associated with a deficient level of anti-HBs or <b>IgG</b> <b>anti-HAV</b> after vaccination are those related to immunosuppression (CD 4 level and HIV RNA viral load) and to the frequency of administration and/or the amount of antigenic load per dose. The duration of the response to both HBV and HAV vaccines is associated with suppression of the viral load at vaccination and, in the case of HBV vaccination, with a higher level of antibodies after vaccination. In terms of safety, {{there is no evidence of}} more, or different, adverse effects compared with HIV-free individuals. Despite literature-based advice on the administration of alternative schedules, revaccination after the failure of primary vaccination, and the need for periodic re-evaluation of antibody levels, few firm recommendations are found in the leading guidelines...|$|R
40|$|Background: Health science {{students}} {{are at an}} increased risk of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection even under accidental infection. The aims of this study were to assess the seroprevalence of HAV in 1 st year medical students and to determine the risk factors of HAV vaccination program among this population. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in autumn 2010. A total of 1028 newly admitted medical students in Isfahan, Kermanshah and Hamedan were included in the study. Participant data were obtained through predesigned data collection sheets. A serum sample was obtained for serologic testing for the presence of IgG anti-HAV using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square and logistic regression tests were performed for statistical analysis and P < 0. 05 was considered as significant. Results: The prevalence of HAV was detected in Isfahan, Hamedan, and Kermanshah newly admitted students 67. 5 %, 79. 2 %, and 50. 6 % respectively. There were significant relations between <b>anti-HAV</b> (<b>IgG)</b> positivity in drinking water and medical students provinces (P < 0. 001, RR = 0. 58 and 0. 65 respectively). The household size did not significantly influence the <b>anti-HAV</b> (<b>IgG)</b> positivity in studied subjects (P = 0. 09, RR = 1. 26). Conclusion: Our results indicate that {{more than one-third of the}} medical students in all three faculties were seronegative for IgG anti-HAV and hence at {{an increased risk of}} developing HAV infection as a result of occupational exposure. Therefore, we suggest students in a health care set up should undergo vaccination against HAV after prevaccination immunity screening...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Viral {{hepatitis}} A {{is still}} a concern at public health level in Brazil and around the world, due both {{to the number of}} affected subjects and the possibility of complications in the acute forms. The Brazilian Ministry of Health estimates that at least 70 % of this country's population has already had contact with the hepatitis A virus (HAV). The aim here was to discover the prevalence of serological markers for the hepatitis A virus among children and teenagers at daycare facilities, kindergartens and elementary schools in the city of Santos. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study in kindergartens and elementary schools within the municipal education network in several regions of the city of Santos. METHOD: Students' family members were surveyed using a questionnaire and 4, 680 finger-prick blood samples were taken and assayed by means of the ELISA technique. RESULTS: The general prevalence of <b>anti-HAV</b> <b>IgG</b> was 9. 72 % and, of these cases, 74. 6 % were reactive to anti-HAV IgM. There was higher prevalence of <b>anti-HAV</b> <b>IgG</b> among older children, females, children who played in streams, those whose homes were not connected to the sewage system, those whose parents had low education levels, those with low household income {{and those who did not}} live along the seashore. The prevalence of anti-HAV IgM peaked in the early years and subsequently fell, and it was lower on the hills and in the Northwestern Zone.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundHepatitis A virus (HAV) {{infection}} is endemic in Egypt. Haemophiliacs {{are at risk}} of transmission through exposure to blood products. We evaluated the seroprevalence of hepatitis A in Egyptian patients with haemophilia A as well as the safety and immunogenicity of subcutaneous hepatitis A vaccine in haemophiliacs. Methods 182 male children and adolescents were studied (82 patients with moderate and severe haemophilia A and 100 healthy controls). Screening for anti-HAV antibody was done and seronegative subjects received hepatitis A vaccine (Havrix™) at a dose of 720 Elisa Units at 0 and 6 months, given subcutaneously in haemophiliacs and intramuscularly for controls. Seroconversion was assessed 2 months after the second vaccine dose by <b>anti-HAV</b> <b>IgG.</b> ResultsSeroprevalence of HAV antibodies was 87. 6 % among haemophiliacs and 90 % among the control group. Seronegative children (mean age 4. 4 ± 3. 71 years) were significantly younger than seropositive children (mean age 10. 2 ± 3. 86 years). Hepatitis A vaccine was given to 10 non immune haemophilia patients and 10 controls. The vaccine was well tolerated with local side effects including pain in 40 % and erythema in 20 % of haemophiliacs versus 20 % for pain and erythema in the control group. All patients and controls developed seroconversion 2 months after the second dose; with no significant difference as regards the titre of <b>anti-HAV</b> <b>IgG</b> (351. 4 ± 65. 0 IU/L for haemophiliacs and 367. 0 ± 132. 3 IU/L for controls). ConclusionHAV infection occurs early in life in Egyptian children, necessitating hepatitis A vaccination in early life.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hepatitis A {{vaccine is}} the most {{frequently}} used travel vaccine, yet data are scarce about its ability to induce protection in patients with concurrent immunosuppressive treatment. We assessed the immunogenicity of this vaccine in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with tumour necrosis factor-inhibitors (TNFi) and/or methotrexate (MTX). METHODS: Hepatitis A vaccine was administered to non-immune RA patients at 0 and 6 months. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) antibodies were assessed at 0, 1, 6, 7, 12, and 24 months with a quantitative Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immuno Assay (CMIA) for HAV-IgG. Samples from month 1, 6, and 7 were, in addition, analysed with a microparticle EIA (MEIA) for <b>anti-HAV</b> IgM + <b>IgG.</b> RESULTS: The final study population consisted of 53 patients treated with TNFi (n = 15), TNFi + MTX (n = 21) or MTX (n = 17). One and six months after the first dose, 10 % and 33 % of the patients had attained seroprotection. One and six months after the second dose 83 % and 72 % were seroprotected. At month 24, 86 % of the vaccinees showed protective levels. CONCLUSIONS: Two doses of hepatitis A vaccine at a 6 -month interval provided protection for most immunosuppressed RA patients. A single dose does not seem to afford sufficient protection to this group of patients...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} immune response of humans to viral capsid polypeptides of hepatitis A virus (HAV) after natural infection, which {{is very important for}} vaccine development. Antiviral capsids in 73 serum samples from patients with acute and chronic HAV infections were analyzed by immunoblotting against individual HAV capsid polypeptides (VP 1, VP 2, VP 3, and VP 4) by using a cell culture-based HAV antigen. For reference, total <b>anti-HAV</b> immunoglobulin G (<b>IgG)</b> and <b>anti-HAV</b> IgM were also determined by radioimmunoassay. As a result, a dominant immune response against VP 1 (98 % IgG, 94 % IgM) was found in the acute phase. However, many other sera also reacted with VP 0 (88 % IgG; 35 % IgM) and VP 3 (81 % IgG and 29 % IgM). In contrast to the acute phase, anti-VP 1, anti-VP 0, and anti-VP 3, IgG antibodies against all three viral proteins (29, 29, and 73 % respectively), especially those against VP 3, were found years after onset of HAV disease and over long periods in the sera of hepatitis patients. These results suggest that antibodies for capsid polypeptides are present over an extended period in the sera of HAV-infected patients. They are likely of importance in maintaining long-term immunity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the seroprevalence of hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) in Korea during 2005. MethodsStudy subjects were selected from across Korea using a stratified multistage probability sampling design, and HAV and HEV seroprevalence was compared on the basis of sex, age, and residency. A total of 497 rural and urban people aged 10 – 99 years of age (mean ± SD age =  28. 87  ±  17. 63  years) were selected by two-stage cluster sampling and tested serologically for <b>anti-HAV</b> and anti-HEV <b>IgG</b> using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. ResultsAmong this population, the overall seroprevalence of HAV was 63. 80 % (55. 21 % aged in their 20 s and 95. 92 % in their 30 s, p <  0. 01) and that of HEV was 9. 40 % (5. 21 % aged in their 20 s and 7. 14 % in their 30 s, p <  0. 01). Seroprevalence also varied according to area of residence. HEV prevalence in rural areas was higher than that of urban regions based on the anti-HEV antibody, odds ratio 3. 22 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 46 – 7. 10, p <  0. 01). There were no significant differences between male and female against anti-HAV/HEV antibodies. ConclusionOur study suggested that the seropositive rates of HAV and HEV might be related to age and environmental conditions...|$|R
