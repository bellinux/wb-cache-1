Sensor developed {{as part of}} <b>antilocking</b> brake system for motorcycles. Uses inlet pressure rather than outlet pressure as braking-control signal, eliminating pressure pulsations caused by pump vanes and ensuring low-noise signal.

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of an electric-field on an electron-hole pair in an {{asymmetric}} system of vertically coupled self-assembled quantum dots taking into account their non-perfect alignment. We show that the non-perfect alignment does not qualitatively influence the exciton Stark effect for the electric field applied in the growth direction, but can be detected by application of a perpendicular electric field. We demonstrate that {{the direction of the}} shift between the axes of non-aligned dots can be detected by rotation of a weak electric field within the plane of confinement. Already for a nearly perfect alignment the two-lowest energy bright exciton states possess <b>antilocked</b> extrema as function of the orientation angle of the horizontal field which appear when the field is parallel to the direction of the shift between the dot centers...|$|R
40|$|The {{results from}} several reviews have been {{presented}} and the aspects of road safety associated with intelligent transport systems (ITS) applications have been addressed. The attempt {{is to make a}} state-of-the-art regarding effects on accidents by categorising systems according to levels of evaluations methods that have been applied. These categories are effects on behaviour, effects on accidents by proxy/surrogate methods, accident studies from real traffic, effects on accident types and finally by meta-analysis where weighted estimates of effects on accidents can be calculated. Thirty-three IT systems including driver assistance systems/advanced driver assistance systems, in-vehicle information systems, in-vehicle data-collection systems and road telematics have been listed. Effects based on meta-analysis are estimated for 11 systems, and single accident studies are found for an additional 2 systems. For the remaining 20 systems, no studies from real road traffic have been identified. Effects on accidents of <b>antilocking</b> brake systems and electronic stability control (ESC) are presented in more detail according to their effects on certain accident types. ESC appears to be very efficient in reducing the number of accidents. Behavioural adaptations to ITS are considered and discussed, especially in terms of compensation mechanisms. Four hypotheses regarding prediction of effects on accidents are stated according to whether systems increase or decrease 'windows of opportunities' by calling upon a driver behaviour model where emotions play a central role. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2007...|$|R
25|$|A 2006 US study {{suggested}} that airbags and <b>antilock</b> brakes {{can lead to}} unsafe driving. A 2007 Canadian study {{suggested that}} unsafe drivers are habitual, and that unsafe driving is increasing. A 2009 Canadian study indicated that, after a steady decline, drinking and driving {{has been on the}} increase since 2004. These support the migration and behavioral adaptation rumble strip concerns.|$|E
25|$|In early 1992, an all new Zetec 16-valve {{engine was}} {{launched}} bringing improved driveability, while also marking {{the return of}} the XR3i which was available with two versions of the 1.8L Zetec engine. The 150PS (110kW) RS2000 also appeared in the autumn of 1991 with a 16v version of the Sierra's I4 2.0L engine and also improved ride and handling meaning that this version of the Escort finally delivered on the road. Specifications, however, were also higher than before. The Escort was now available with items such as power steering, electric windows, central locking, electronic <b>antilock</b> brakes, and air conditioning. Some of these options were even available on some of the entry-level models.|$|E
500|$|Vehicle-related SCI is {{prevented}} with measures including societal {{and individual}} {{efforts to reduce}} {{driving under the influence}} of drugs or alcohol, distracted driving, and drowsy driving. [...] Other efforts include increasing road safety (such as marking hazards and adding lighting) and vehicle safety, both to prevent accidents (such as routine maintenance and <b>antilock</b> brakes) and to mitigate the damage of crashes (such as [...] head restraints, air bags, seat belts, and child safety seats). [...] Falls can be prevented by making changes to the environment, such as nonslip materials and grab bars in bathtubs and showers, railings for stairs, child and safety gates for windows. Gun-related injuries can be prevented with conflict resolution training, gun safety education campaigns, and changes to the technology of guns (such as trigger locks) to improve their safety. [...] Sports injuries can be prevented with changes to sports rules and equipment to increase safety, and education campaigns to reduce risky practices such as diving into water of unknown depth or head-first tackling in association football.|$|E
40|$|The pure braking and {{cornering}} forces {{of a given}} tyre on a given wet surface at a given speed are functions of braking slip and slip angle respectively. These functional relationships are of greal importance {{in connection with the}} handling and stability of vehicles and the behaviour of brakes and <b>antilocking</b> devices. When corner-ing and braking occur simultaneously the forces interact and: the functional relationships are modified, with consequent effects on vehicle characteristics. The empirical data available at the Laboratory on these relationships, both for pure forces and for forces in combination, are presented. The known effects of such factors as speed, road surface texture, tread pattern, tread resilience, and tyre construction are reported, but since the work was carried out at various times and for various purposes the coverage is incomplete and uneven. The test vehicle, test procedure and the methods of measuring and evaluating the data are briefly described. Some data have been analysed statistically to discover the dependence of the various frictional coefficients on factors such as those mentioned above. It is believed that greater use should be made of these statistical techniques in future work. Raw data can also be converted into such practical quantities as braking distances, wheel locking times, etc., by computing theoretically the behaviour of model braking systems. An example of such a study is given...|$|R

2500|$|Chrysler, {{together}} with the Bendix Corporation, introduced a computerized, three-channel, four-sensor all-wheel ABS called [...] "Sure Brake" [...] for its 1971 Imperial. It was available for several years thereafter, functioned as intended, and proved reliable. In 1970, Ford added an <b>antilock</b> braking system called [...] "Sure-track" [...] to the rear wheels of Lincoln Continentals as an option; it became standard in 1971. In 1971, General Motors introduced the [...] "Trackmaster" [...] rear-wheel only ABS as an option on their rear-wheel drive Cadillac models and the Oldsmobile Toronado. In the same year, Nissan offered an EAL (Electro Anti-lock System) developed by Japanese company Denso as an option on the Nissan President, which became Japan's first electronic ABS.|$|E
2500|$|Donohue chronicled {{his entire}} racing {{career in the}} book, The Unfair Advantage (co-written with noted {{motorsports}} and engineering journalist Paul Van Valkenburgh). The book documents his career from his first races to his final full season of racing the year before he was killed. This was not merely a celebrity autobiography, but a detailed, step-by-step record of the engineering approach he took to getting the absolutely highest performance from every car he drove, always looking for that elusive [...] "unfair advantage". Donohue (along with Penske) were pioneers in many rights, some as notable {{as the use of}} a skidpad as a tool for developing and perfecting race car suspension designs and setups. The book told how Donohue learned to exploit the <b>antilock</b> braking system and the powerful turbocharged engine of several prototype Porsches, as well as how he learned from various mishaps, including a near-fatal crash. The book was published shortly before Donohue's death.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{technological}} singularity is usually {{seen as a}} sudden event, some scholars argue the current speed of change already fits this description. In addition, some argue that we {{are already in the}} midst of a major evolutionary transition that merges technology, biology, and society. Digital technology has infiltrated the fabric of human society to a degree of indisputable and often life-sustaining dependence. A 2016 article in Trends in Ecology & Evolution argues that [...] "humans already embrace fusions of biology and technology. We spend most of our waking time communicating through digitally mediated channels... we trust artificial intelligence with our lives through <b>antilock</b> braking in cars and autopilots in planes... With one in three marriages in America beginning online, digital algorithms are also taking a role in human pair bonding and reproduction". The article argues that from the perspective of the evolution, several previous Major Transitions in Evolution have transformed life through innovations in information storage and replication (RNA, DNA, multicellularity, and culture and language). In the current stage of life's evolution, the carbon-based biosphere has generated a cognitive system (humans) capable of creating technology that will result in a comparable evolutionary transition. The digital information created by humans has reached a similar magnitude to biological information in the biosphere. Since the 1980s, [...] "the quantity of digital information stored has doubled about every 2.5 years, reaching about 5 zettabytes in 2014 (5x10^21 bytes). In biological terms, there are 7.2 billion humans on the planet, each having a genome of 6.2 billion nucleotides. Since one byte can encode four nucleotide pairs, the individual genomes of every human on the planet could be encoded by approximately 1x10^19 bytes. The digital realm stored 500 times more information than this in 2014 (...see Figure)... The total amount of DNA contained in all of the cells on Earth is estimated to be about 5.3x10^37 base pairs, equivalent to 1.325x10^37 bytes of information. If growth in digital storage continues at its current rate of 30–38% compound annual growth per year, it will rival the total information content contained in all of the DNA in all of the cells on Earth in about 110 years. This would represent a doubling of the amount of information stored in the biosphere across a total time period of just 150 years".|$|E

Most automotive engine controllers incorporate a [...] "limp mode" [...] for each sensor, so that the engine will continue to operate if the sensor or its wiring fails. Another, more trivial example of a limp mode is that some cars test door switches, and automatically turn lights on using seat-belt occupancy sensors if the door switches fail.|$|E
