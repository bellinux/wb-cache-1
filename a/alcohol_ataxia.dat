40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{mechanisms}} of cerebellar degeneration attributed to prolonged and excessive alcohol intake remain unclear. Additional or even alternative causes of cerebellar degeneration are often overlooked in suspected cases of alcohol-related ataxia. The objectives {{of this study}} were two fold: (1) to investigate the prevalence of gluten-related serological markers in patients with alcohol-related ataxia and; (2) to compare the pattern of brain involvement on magnetic resonance imaging between patients with alcohol and gluten ataxias. MATERIALS & METHODS: Patients diagnosed with alcohol and gluten ataxias were identified from a retrospective review of patients attending a tertiary clinic. HLA genotype and serological markers of gluten-related disorders were recorded. Cerebellar volumetry, MR spectroscopy and voxel-based morphometric analyses were performed on patients and compared with matched control data. RESULTS: Of 904 registered patients, 104 had <b>alcohol</b> <b>ataxia</b> and 159 had gluten ataxia. 61 % of the <b>alcohol</b> <b>ataxia</b> group and 70 % of the gluten ataxia group had HLA DQ 2 /DQ 8 genotype compared to 30 % in healthy local blood donors. 44 % of patients with <b>alcohol</b> <b>ataxia</b> had antigliadin antibodies compared to 12 % in the healthy local population and 10 % in patients with genetically confirmed ataxias. None of the patients with <b>alcohol</b> <b>ataxia</b> and antigliadin antibodies had celiac disease compared to 40 % in patients with gluten ataxia. The pattern of structural brain abnormality in patients with <b>alcohol</b> <b>ataxia</b> who had antigliadin antibodies differed from gluten ataxia and was identical to that of <b>alcohol</b> <b>ataxia.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol related cerebellar degeneration may, in genetically susceptible individuals, induce sensitization to gluten. Such sensitization may result from a primary cerebellar insult, but a more systemic effect is also possible. The duration and amount of exposure to alcohol may not be the only factors responsible for the cerebellar insult...|$|E

50|$|Another classic {{finding of}} <b>alcohol</b> {{intoxication}} is <b>ataxia,</b> in its appendicular, gait, and truncal forms. Appendicular ataxia results in jerky, uncoordinated {{movements of the}} limbs, as though each muscle were working independently from the others. Truncal ataxia results in postural instability; gait instability is manifested as a disorderly, wide-based gait with inconsistent foot positioning. Ataxia {{is responsible for the}} observation that drunk people are clumsy, sway back and forth, and often fall down. It is presumed to be due to alcohol's effect on the cerebellum.|$|R
40|$|The {{extent of}} any {{structural}} or functional brain abnormality {{in patients with}} CD {{is yet to be}} fully characterised but may be potentially evaluated through the analysis of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Current evidence suggests a propensity for cerebellar disease in these patients as evident by gluten ataxia: an idiopathic sporadic ataxia with positive gluten related antibodies. Recently, excessive alcohol consumption has been shown to mediate an IgA immune response against transglutaminase 2 thus, raising the possibility of alcohol not just having a direct toxic effect on the cerebellum but also inducing an immune response that may cause cerebellar damage via different pathways. The prevalence of gluten-related serological markers in patients with alcohol-related ataxia is still to be evaluated. This work had the following aims: (1) To establish the prevalence of neurological deficit in patients with newly diagnosed coeliac disease (CD), (2) To compare the clinicoradiological features and evaluate the use of MR imaging as a potential biomarker of this group with two other groups: (a) patients with established CD that had been referred for neurological opinion and (b) patients presenting with a neurological complaint that lead to the diagnosis of CD, (3) To investigate the prevalence of gluten-related serological markers in patients with alcohol-related ataxia and compare the pattern of brain involvement on MR imaging between patients with <b>alcohol</b> and gluten <b>ataxia.</b> The following chapters will try to address these questions. ...|$|R
