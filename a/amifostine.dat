50|$|Platinum-containing {{chemotherapeutic}} agents, including cisplatin and carboplatin, {{are associated}} with cochleotoxicity characterized by high-frequency hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing in the ears).

Cisplatin-induced ototoxicity is dose-dependent, typically occurring with doses greater than 60 mg/m2, and tend to occur when chemotherapy is given every two weeks compared to every one week. Cisplatin and related agents are absorbed by the cochlear hair cells and result in ototoxicity through the production of reactive oxygen species.

40|$|Background: Mannitol {{is present}} in the Ethyol ® (the trade name of <b>amifostine)</b> as an excipient. The {{mechanism}} of radioprotection of <b>amifostine</b> is radical scavenging. Since mannitol is another known radical scavenger, we studied the probable additive or synergistic effect of mannitol on the effect of <b>amifostine.</b> Material and Methods: Mice were irradiated with Co- 60 γ-ray in the presence 400 mg/kg mannitol alone or in combination with 400 mg/kg <b>amifostine.</b> Survival of mice was assessed within 30 days after irradiation (LD 50 / 30). Moreover, the protective effect of drugs was evaluated using micronuclei (MN) assay. Slides were prepared using femoral bone marrow flush and stained in May-Giemsa. The frequency of MN was determined in polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) for each sample. Results: Similar LD 50 / 30 was observed for irradiated mice in the presence of <b>amifostine</b> alone or in combinations with mannitol. High frequency of MN was produced by 3 Gy γ-rays. <b>Amifostine</b> reduced radiation induced MN dramatically, but mannitol had no effect on γ-rays induced MN. Combination of mannitol with <b>amifostine</b> did not change the effect of <b>amifostine</b> alone.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} the protective ability of <b>amifostine</b> on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) -derived colony-forming unit (CFU) and PB CD 34 + cells which were previously exposed in vitro to etoposide, carboplatin, doxorubicin and taxotere. <b>Amifostine</b> pretreatment protected PBMC-derived CFU from the toxic effect of etoposide, carboplatin and taxotere. A significant detrimental effect was exerted by <b>amifostine</b> {{on the growth}} of doxorubicin-treated PBMC-derived CFU. Liquid cultures of PB CD 34 + cells reproduced faithfully the effects observed on growth of PBMC-derived CFU and confirmed <b>amifostine</b> chemoprotection against etoposide and carboplatin with its detrimental effect on doxorubicin-treated progenitors. Combining the data of viable cell count, cytometric estimation of apoptosis, cell cycle and viable cell replication rate, we found that <b>amifostine</b> protects from etoposide and carboplatin toxicity mainly through a mechanism of cell rescue.

This study describes the direct effect of <b>amifostine</b> on kidney and tumor uptake of 111 In- DOTA,Tyr 3 -octreotate. Methods: In vivo biodistribution studies were performed using CA 20948 tumor-bearing rats, with or without <b>amifostine</b> coadministration, via several routes.

40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} <b>amifostine,</b> we administered <b>amifostine,</b> a radioprotective agent, 30 minutes before exposing the maxillary region of mice, including the parotid gland, to 5 Gy or 10 Gy X-ray irradiation. The survival rate was recorded, {{and changes in the}} parotid gland morphology were investigated by examining the hematoxylin and eosin (HE) -stained specimens and light microscope autoradiography (LMARG) images obtained 30 days after irradiation. A survival rate of 100 % was not observed in any group administered 200 mg/kg <b>amifostine</b> with or without irradiation. Among the groups irradiated with 10 Gy X-rays, the survival rate was higher and the survival period was longer in the 100 mg/kg <b>amifostine</b> group than in the no <b>amifostine</b> group. The histological findings in the group that received 5 Gy irradiation without <b>amifostine</b> were as follows : auxetic growth of acinar cells, nuclei of all sizes, cells in the mitotic phase, and cells undergoing apoptosis. Further, the treated groups were compared with the no <b>amifostine</b> and no irradiation group (untreated control). LMRG imaging revealed that the number of reduced silver grains per mm 2 of acinar cells after 30 min of 3 H-leucine administration was higher than that after 120 min in mice treated with 100 mg/kg <b>amifostine</b> with or without 5 Gy irradiation. This observation was similar to that in the untreated control. This finding suggests that although <b>amifostine</b> administration reduces the adverse effects of irradiation on the parotid gland, higher doses of <b>amifostine</b> may be fatal...|$|E

We investigated the effect of <b>amifostine</b> in BLM-induced lung injury in mice. Mice received intraperitoneal <b>amifostine</b> (200 mg/kg) 30 min before and/or 1, 3, and 7 days after an intratracheal injection of saline or BLM (4 U/kg).

40|$|<b>Amifostine</b> {{has been}} shown in {{randomized}} trials to protect normal tissues from radiation. It is a thiophosphate prodrug that is dephosphorylated to the active free thiol metabolite, WR- 1065, by plasma membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase. Selectivity of <b>amifostine</b> may be due to differences between the microenvironment of normal tissues and tumor (e. g., pH and enzymatic activity) and different uptake processes. We proposed to optimize the use of <b>amifostine</b> as a radiation protector of normal liver, which will permit the safe delivery of higher doses of radiation for patients with both focal and diffuse disease. We carried out nonclinical studies to optimize <b>amifostine</b> selectivity (i. e., the concentration of WR- 1065 in liver to tumor) in a rat xenograft model with different dosing routes of drug (systemic vs regional and IV vs SC). The pharmacokinetics of <b>amifostine</b> and WR- 1065 were evaluated in a phase I trial of dose-escalating radiation therapy with systemic <b>amifostine</b> for liver cancer patients. Following intravenous dosing of <b>amifostine,</b> the concentrations of WR- 1065 in liver and blood were highest at the earliest sampling time and higher doses, while tumor levels were relatively constant with respect to time. Based on our response surface regression model, no significant difference was observed between systemic and regional administrations of <b>amifostine.</b> After subcutaneous dosing of <b>amifostine,</b> optimal selectivity was sustained for a period of 5 - 20 min. While the liver and tumor concentrations of WR- 1065 were initially low and increased steadily over time, blood levels were relatively constant over time. These findings recommend that the highest intravenous dose of <b>amifostine</b> tolerated be administered, and that radiotherapy begin shortly after dosing for liver cancer patients. A subcutaneous dose, which is an easier administration route, may be a reasonable substitute when dosed 5 - 20 min before radiotherapy. Clinical pharmacokinetic results indicated that <b>amifostine</b> has a short half-life, a small volume of distribution and a large clearance. WR- 1065 has a much longer half-life, and larger volume of distribution and clearance as compared to <b>amifostine.</b> In conclusion, <b>amifostine</b> was converted to WR- 1065 rapidly and confined to extracellular fluid in the body.

An influence of <b>amifostine</b> on the pharmacokinetics of carboplatin, resulting in higher platinum concentrations in plasma and tissues of the tumour-bearing nude mice, {{was thought to be}} the cause of enhancement of the antitumour activity.
