2500|$|Tatangelo, meanwhile, {{decided to}} run for mayor to {{challenge}} the status quo, or the so-called [...] "Old Party" [...] or the [...] "patron system" [...] or the [...] "Independent Club", by which voters defer to one or two usually elected officials in the community with the expectation that those individuals will provide personal favors when needed. The Laredo leadership claimed that citizens preferred the patron system so that major political decisions would be handled on their behalf by trusted officials. Fernando Pinon, a former Laredo Morning Times editor, wrote a book Patron Democracy, about this peculiar phenomenon. He told The Laredo Morning Times: [...] "I would go to the city council meeting, and nobody would pay <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I said, 'Maybe I should be inside, instead of outside looking in.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 201, after Cao Cao {{defeated}} his northern rival Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu, he sent Zhang Liao {{to pacify}} the various counties in Lu State, and then ordered him and Xiahou Yuan to lead an army {{to attack a}} minor warlord Chang Xi (昌豨) in Donghai Commandery (東海郡; around present-day Linyi, Shandong). Zhang Liao and Xiahou Yuan had besieged Chang Xi for months but were unable to defeat him and their supplies were running out, so they considered retreating. Zhang Liao told Xiahou Yuan, [...] "Over the past several days, whenever we attacked Chang Xi, I noticed he paid careful <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> He's also running short of arrows. I suspect he's having doubts, therefore he isn't {{doing his best to}} resist us. Wouldn't it be better if I manage to persuade him to surrender?" [...] He then sent a message to Chang Xi and asked to speak to him. When Zhang Liao met Chang Xi, he told the latter that Cao Cao rewarded those who submitted to him. Convinced by Zhang Liao, Chang Xi agreed to surrender to Cao Cao. Zhang Liao then went to Chang Xi's home alone and visited his family. Chang Xi was delighted and he followed Zhang Liao and Xiahou Yuan back to meet Cao Cao.|$|E
60|$|I was well-nigh choking, and my {{eyes were}} {{certainly}} fiery. He drew <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Emma pondered a moment, {{and then}} replied, [...] "I will not {{pretend not to}} {{understand}} you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assured that no such effect has followed his <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> as you are apprehensive of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘That reminds me,’ said I. ‘I {{have a great}} curiosity, and you can satisfy it. Why {{were you}} so forward to meddle with poor Mr. Dubois? Why did you {{transfer}} your <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>me?</b> And generally, what induced you to make yourself such a nuisance?’ ...|$|R
60|$|Taking {{a hearty}} leave of my {{excellent}} friend Don Juan, {{who had been}} unremitting in his <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the last moment, I now set off on my wayfaring, gratified to the utmost with my visit, and full of kind and grateful feelings towards Moguer and its hospitable inhabitants.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And whose appearance,' {{interposed}} his sister, directing general <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in my indefinable costume, 'is perfectly scandalous and disgraceful.' ...|$|E
60|$|Without {{paying the}} least <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> Mrs. Yolland took another {{dive into the}} rubbish, and came up out of it, this time, with a dog-chain.|$|E
60|$|In vain I {{tried to}} catch sight of some one. The men, in a perfect panic, rushed hither and thither, but no one paid any <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{always said}} so,' was Mrs. Lowme's reply, {{when he made}} the {{observation}} to her; 'she was always so very full of pretty <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> when I was ill. But they tell me now she's turned Tryanite; if that's it we shan't agree again. It's very inconsistent in her, I think, turning round in that way, after being the foremost to laugh at the Tryanite cant, and especially in a woman of her habits; she should cure herself of them before she pretends to be over-religious.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Cover my face. There {{will be no}} good be done [...] By drawing their <b>attention</b> off <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] Bear me along, good fellows; I am but one [...] Among {{the many}} darkened here to-day! ...|$|R
60|$|As to the burglars, I am {{perfectly}} {{familiar with}} these people. I {{have always had}} a good deal to do with burglars--not officially, but through their <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I never suffered anything {{at the hands of a}} burglar. They have invaded my house time and time again. They never got anything. Then those people who burglarized our house in September--we got back the plated ware they took off, we jailed them, and I have been sorry ever since. They did us a great service they scared off all the servants in the place.|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{this will}} trouble {{you for a}} little while," [...] the Doctor said. [...] "When I came to the University the first time I seemed like a cat in a bath tub. I thought {{everybody}} was laughing at me, but, {{as a matter of}} fact, nobody paid any <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> at all. Then I got mad, and I said, 'Well, I'll make you pay <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> before I'm done.'" [...] The Doctor smiled at her and she had the courage to smile back. It was wonderful how well he understood her.|$|E
60|$|But {{neither of}} them paid much <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Anscombe did say, out of politeness, I suppose, that pitch and {{subterranean}} fires should be added, or some such nonsense.|$|E
60|$|The {{big blue}} eyes of Basil Grant were {{standing}} {{out of his}} head and he was paying no <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> He was staring {{over the side of the}} tram.|$|E
6000|$|... "I could devise {{no other}} means. I thought and thought, {{but there was}} no {{alternate}} except a hideous public scandal, and a private sorrow which would have clouded our lives. I acted for the best, incredible as it may seem to you, and I only ask your <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> enable <b>me</b> <b>to</b> prove it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I return you my Brother's poems {{with many}} Thanks. Mrs. B. {{has had the}} [...] <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> send <b>me</b> 2 copies. I like some of them very much: but you [...] will laugh when I tell you I have never had courage to shew them to [...] Lord Carlisle for fear of his disapproving others." ...|$|R
5000|$|Elena and {{her three}} {{surviving}} older brothers, Kirill, Boris, and Andrei, had an English nanny and spoke English as their first language. The young Elena had a temper and was sometimes out of control. When she posed for an artist at age four, she grabbed a paper knife and threatened her nurse, who hid behind the artist. [...] "The little lady then transferred her <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> her black eyes ablaze with fury," [...] recalled the artist. Elena, raised by a mother who was highly conscious of her social status, was also considered snobbish by some. [...] "Poor little thing, I feel sorry for her," [...] wrote her mother's social rival, Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, [...] "for she is really quite sweet, but vain and pretty grandiose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think, {{after your}} kind <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I cannot do less than relieve any curiosity {{that you may}} feel. You must know {{that my father was}} Stanislaus Stanniford, the banker." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can hardly}} say. His arms are {{stretched}} out on the table, and his face is hidden on them. He paid no <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I am almost afraid he was crying." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ain't he just a {{great old}} fellow?" [...] said Dan. [...] "He knows I'm kind of sick, {{just as well as}} a human. He never pays no <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> when I'm well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is no {{more than}} justice to Betts Shoreham," [...] she continued, [...] "to say that he has NOT been pointed in his <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>ME.</b> We females are said to be quick in {{discovering}} such matters, and I am not more blind than the rest of our sex. He is a young man of good family, and has some fortune, and that makes him welcome in most houses in town, while he is agreeable, well-looking, and thoroughly amiable. He met us abroad, and it is natural for him to keep up an intimacy that recalls pleasant recollections. You will remember, Mary, that before he can be accused of trifling, he must trifle. I think him far more attentive to my mother, my father--nay, to my two little sisters--than he is <b>to</b> <b>ME.</b> Even Mademoiselle Hennequin is quite as much if not more of a favorite than I am!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Capadose {{appeared}} not {{to perceive}} {{it or not}} to heed it if she did. 'There was a person, not far from your door, whom Clement called my <b>attention</b> <b>to.</b> He told <b>me</b> something about her but we were going the other way.' ...|$|R
60|$|In the {{beginning}} it all arose from a slight attack of fever. My work necessitated my being in camp for some months between Pakpattan and Mubarakpur--a desolate sandy stretch of country as every one who has had the misfortune to go there may know. My coolies were neither more nor less exasperating than other gangs, and my work demanded sufficient <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> keep <b>me</b> from moping, had I been inclined to so unmanly a weakness.|$|R
60|$|The man was far {{too busy}} to pay any <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> He was {{kneeling}} in a corner {{with his back to}} me, putting something in his bag. I seized the opportunity to steal softly from the room.|$|E
60|$|No one {{appeared}} {{to give any}} <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> however, and then I listened for a proclamation by the town crier; but none met my ears, neither did I see printed notices of any kind referring to Archie.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] said he, and I am now persuaded that my words turned his <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{for the first}} time, {{but at the moment}} I was sure some impertinent meaning lurked behind his answer.|$|E
60|$|It was on {{the very}} evening of our perilous {{adventure}} with Challenger's home-made balloon that the change came in our fortunes. I {{have said that the}} one person from whom we had had some sign of sympathy in our attempts to get away was the young chief whom we had rescued. He alone had no desire to hold us against our will in a strange land. He had told us as much by his expressive language of signs. That evening, after dusk, he came down to our little camp, handed me (for some reason he had always shown his <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> perhaps because I {{was the one who was}} nearest his age) a small roll of the bark of a tree, and then pointing solemnly up at the row of caves above him, he had put his finger to his lips as a sign of secrecy and had stolen back again to his people.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} guilty of the vanity of letting Mr. Armadale admire me, and I have {{suffered}} for it," [...] resumed Miss Gwilt. [...] "If there had been any confidence between my pupil and me, I might have easily satisfied her that she might become Mrs. Armadale--if she could--without having any rivalry to fear on my part. But Miss Milroy disliked and distrusted me from the first. She took her own jealous view, no doubt, of Mr. Armadale's thoughtless <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> It was her interest to destroy the position, such as it was, that I held in his estimation; and it is quite likely her mother assisted her. Mrs. Milroy had her motive also (which I am really ashamed to mention) for wishing <b>to</b> drive <b>me</b> out of the house. Anyhow, the conspiracy has succeeded. I have been forced (with Mr. Armadale's help) to leave the major's service. Don't be angry, Mr. Midwinter! Don't form a hasty opinion! I dare say Miss Milroy has some good qualities, though I have not found them out; and I assure you {{again and again that}} I don't blame Mr. Armadale. I only blame the people whose instrument he is." ...|$|R
60|$|Directing his man {{to fetch}} {{a certain kind}} of Madeira, he turned <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with a look of polite inquiry which was {{scarcely}} reassuring. And I reflected, the caution with which I had been endowed coming uppermost, that the man might have changed since Monsieur Gratiot had seen him. He had, moreover, the air of a man who gives a forced <b>attention,</b> which seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the natural consequences of the recent actions of his son.|$|R
60|$|The {{battle was}} over--unless the beast {{considered}} me fair prey, too. I waited, ready for him with knife and bludgeon--also filched from a dead foeman; but he paid no <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> falling to work instead to devour {{one of the}} corpses.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dear me, Kate,' {{interrupted}} Mrs Nickleby, 'what in {{the name}} of goodness graciousness makes you fly off to the time before I was married, when I'm talking to you about his thoughtfulness and <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>me?</b> You don't seem to take the smallest interest in the garden.' ...|$|E
60|$|As Lorquas Ptomel {{raised his}} eyes to address the {{prisoner}} they fell on me {{and he turned to}} Tars Tarkas with a word, and gesture of impatience. Tars Tarkas made some reply which I could not catch, but which caused Lorquas Ptomel to smile; after which they paid no further <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Let {{me begin}} with young Armadale--because it is {{beginning}} with good news. I have produced the right impression on him already, and Heaven knows that is nothing to boast of! Any moderately good-looking woman who chose to take the trouble could make him {{fall in love with}} her. He is a rattle-pated young fool--one of those noisy, rosy, light-haired, good-tempered men whom I particularly detest. I had a whole hour alone with him in a boat, the first day I came here, and I have made good use of my time, I can tell you, from that day to this. The only difficulty with him is the difficulty of concealing my own feelings, especially when he turns my dislike of him into downright hatred by sometimes reminding me of his mother. I really never saw a man whom I could use so ill, if I had the opportunity. He will give me the opportunity, I believe, if no accident happens, sooner than we calculated on. I have just returned from a party at the great house, in celebration of the rent-day dinner, and the squire's <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and my modest reluctance to receive them, have already excited general remark.|$|R
60|$|We {{got through}} the dinner, to all outward {{appearance}} at least, happily enough. When the ladies had risen from table, and Mr. Gilmore and I were left alone in the dining-room, a new interest presented itself <b>to</b> occupy our <b>attention,</b> and <b>to</b> give <b>me</b> an opportunity of quieting myself by {{a few minutes of}} needful and welcome silence. The servant who had been despatched to trace Anne Catherick and Mrs. Clements returned with his report, and was shown into the dining-room immediately.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} the result of five years of work in which I have been {{supported}} by many people. I appreciate that I now have the opportunity to express my gratitude to all of them. The first person I would like to thank is my advisor Dianne Newman. It is difficult to overstate my gratitude to her. I remember from my very first conversation with Dianne about five years ago, I was drawn to her tremendous enthusiasm and insightful views on research. She helped me discover the wonderful world of geobiology and helped me build a strong foundation from ground zero in microbiology, in which I am now developing my career. Throughout my PhD, her inspiring and encouraging ways have guided <b>me</b> <b>to</b> a deeper understanding of knowledge work. Her persistence and very optimistic attitude kept me moving forward and learning despite the highs and lows. Being an international student with English as my second language, she gave <b>me</b> extra <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> help <b>me</b> improve English. It is through her patient advice that I have grown into a more mature scientist. I would like to thank other members of my thesis committee who guided my wor...|$|R
