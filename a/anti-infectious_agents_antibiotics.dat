We matched 120 serum samples from Kitavans with 437 samples from four healthy control groups. Sera were tested for the presence of <b>anti-infectious</b> <b>agent</b> antibodies (treponema, toxoplsmosis, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, rubella) and autoantiobodies [anti-double-stranded (ds) DNA, anti-chromatin, anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP), anti-SSB, anti-SSA, anti-Scl- 70, anti-Smith, anti-centromer, anti-SmRNP, anti-Jo- 1, and anti-ribosomal-P] using the Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200. Antitreponemal antibodies were detected in 87 % of PNG sera versus 0 - 6 % of controls (P < 0. 0001). Anti-dsDNA antibodies were detected in 31 % of PNG samples, which was significantly higher than in three of the control groups (< 10 %). The outstanding high rate of antitreponemal antibodies detected in Kitavans possibly represents prior yaws disease. A low prevalence of cardiovascular disease was previously documented in Kitavans and has been attributed, in addition to their diet, to the high prevalence of natural cardioprotective autoantibodies (the IgM-antiphosphorylcholine antibodies) in this population. Treponemal infection has been shown to induce the appearance of antiphosphorylcholine antibodies. These protective autoantibodies may cross-react with the pathogenic anti-dsDNA antibodies. Thus, it is suggested that infection with treponema is associated with the presence of protective as well as pathogenic autoantibodies...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Currently {{not much}} is known {{regarding}} the environmental factors involved in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). It {{is even more}} unclear which factors may determine the subgroup (i. e., AMA status) of patients with PBC. We thus tested AMA+and AMA- PBC patients' sera for antibodies (Abs) against multiple infectious agents. METHODS: Sera from 69 patients with PBC (49 AMA+and 20 AMA-) and 100 matched controls were screened for IgG-Abs against Toxoplasma gondii, Helicobacter pylori, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B, and hepatitis C utilizing the BioPlex 2200 and ELISA kits (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). RESULTS: The prevalence of four <b>anti-infectious</b> <b>agents</b> Abs was significantly elevated among PBC patients when compared with controls, namely anti-T. gondii (ATxA; 71 % vs. 40 %, p< 0. 0001), EBV early antigen (EA; 44 % vs. 12 %, p< 0. 0001), H. pylori (54 % vs. 31 %, p< 0. 01), and CMV (90 % vs. 75 %, p< 0. 05) Abs, respectively. The co-occurrence of these four <b>anti-infectious</b> <b>agents</b> Abs was highly common in PBC, whereas this infection burden was rare in healthy subjects (20 % vs. 3 % respectively, p< 0. 0001). Furthermore, specific infections interactions possibly increasing PBC risk were noted as well. Seropositivity of ATxA was inversely associated with cirrhosis among PBC patients (p< 0. 05). Finally, no differences were observed between AMA- sera and their AMA+counterparts with regard to seroprevalence {{of any of the}} investigated infectious agents. CONCLUSIONS: We note the association of ATxA and PBC, with the possibility of a milder disease manifestation.

The series displayed antiparasite activity in the low to mid-micromolar range and establishes a preliminary structure-activity relationship, with the 4 ',N(3) -di-(3, 5 -dimethylbenzoyl) -substituted analogues showing the most prominent activity. Utilizing an array of specially adapted cell lines, it was established that this series of analogues likely act through a common target. Moreover, the strong correlation between the trypanocidal and anti-leishmanial activities indicates that this mechanism is likely shared between the two species. EC 50 values were unaffected by the disabling of pyrimidine biosynthesis in T. brucei, showing that these uridine analogues do not act directly on the enzymes of pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism. The lack of cross-resistance with 5 -fluorouracil, also establishes that the carbocyclic analogues are not imported through the known uracil transporters, thus offering forth new insights for this class of nucleosides.
