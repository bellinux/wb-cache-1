500|$|Patton's brigade {{was then}} moved to support U.S. I Corps in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive on September 26. He {{personally}} led a troop of tanks through thick fog as they advanced [...] into German lines. Around 09:00, Patton was wounded while leading six men and a tank in an attack on German machine guns {{near the town of}} Cheppy. His orderly, Private First Class Joe Angelo, saved Patton, for which he was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Patton commanded the battle from a shell hole for another hour before being evacuated. He stopped at a rear command post to submit his report before heading to a hospital. Sereno E. Brett, commander of the U.S. 326th Tank Battalion, took command of the brigade in Patton's absence. Patton {{wrote in a letter to}} his wife: [...] "The bullet went into the front of my left leg and came out just <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>of</b> my bottom about two inches to the left of my rectum.

2500|$|Workers, {{including}} the new Polish arrivals, {{were introduced to the}} industry usually <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>of</b> dawn outside one of the packing plants. Crowds of hundreds and sometimes thousands of laborers, mostly unskilled, gathered near the various employment offices. They appeared every morning at around six o'clock and waited for about an hour. The employment agent walked among the crowd and picked those who seemed the strongest and best able to do unskilled work at the plant. The agent did not allow any bargaining over wages or hours; he simply tapped the men he had chosen on the back and said: [...] "Come along!" [...] Generally, the agent only picked a few. The rest of the group would be back the next day.|$|E

The Australian newspaper judged the throng to be 10,000 strong. The paper was disdainful of the ghoulish mob yet, at the same time, congratulated them on their good behavior. Captain John Knatchbull aged 56 years, was led out into Forbes Street, at the gaol gates on the Darlinghurst Ridge. [...] Wearing genteel black broadcloth, Captain Knatchbull then [...] "ascended the fatal scaffold without trepidation or fear, and was launched into another world with a noble and fervent prayer trembling on his lips".

60|$|I am {{much better}} without tobacco, and {{already have a}} {{difficulty}} in sympathizing with the man I used to be. Even to call him up, as it were, and regard him without prejudice is a difficult task, for we forget the old selves on whom we have turned our backs, as we forget a street that has been reconstructed. Does the freed slave always shiver <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>of</b> a whip? I fancy not, for I recall but dimly, and without acute suffering, the horrors of my smoking days. There were nights when I awoke with a pain at my heart that made me hold my breath. I did not dare move. After perhaps ten minutes of dread, I would shift my position an inch at a time. Less frequently I felt this sting in the daytime, and believed I was dying while my friends were talking to me. I never mentioned these experiences to a human being; indeed, though a medical man was among my companions, I cunningly deceived him {{on the rare occasions}} when he questioned me about the amount of tobacco I was consuming weekly. Often in the dark I not only vowed to give up smoking, but wondered why I cared for it. Next morning I went straight from breakfast to my pipe, without the smallest struggle with myself. Latterly I knew, while resolving to break myself of the habit, that I would be better employed trying to sleep. I had elaborate ways of cheating myself, but it became disagreeable to me to know how many ounces of tobacco I was smoking weekly. Often I smoked cigarettes {{to reduce the number of}} my cigars.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was plain}} {{that the enemy}} had retreated to Corinth. The arrival of our fresh troops and their {{successful}} passage of the river had disheartened him. Three or four of his gray cavalry videttes moving amongst {{the trees on the}} crest of a hill in our front, and galloping out of sight <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>of</b> our skirmishers' rifles, confirmed us in the belief; an army face to face with its enemy does not employ cavalry to watch its front. True, they might be a general and his staff. Crowning this rise we found a level field, {{a quarter of a mile}} in width; beyond it a gentle acclivity, covered with an undergrowth of young oaks, impervious to sight. We pushed on into the open, but the division halted at the edge. Having orders to conform to its movements, we halted too; but that did not suit; we received an intimation to proceed. I had performed this sort of service before, and in the exercise of my discretion deployed my platoon, pushing it forward at a run, with trailed arms, to strengthen the skirmish line, which I overtook some thirty or forty yards from the wood. Then--I can't describe it--the forest seemed all at once to flame up and disappear with a crash like that of a great wave upon the beach--a crash that expired in hot hissings, and the sickening [...] "spat" [...] of lead against flesh. A dozen of my brave fellows tumbled over like ten-pins. Some struggled to their feet, only to go down again, and yet again. Those who stood fired into the smoking brush and doggedly retired. We had expected to find, at most, a line of skirmishers similar to our own; it was with a view to overcoming them by a sudden coup at the moment of collision that I had thrown forward my little reserve. What we had found was a line of battle, coolly holding its fire till it could count our teeth. There was no more to be done but get back across the open ground, every superficial yard of which was throwing up its little jet of mud provoked by an impinging bullet. We got back, most of us, and I shall never forget the ludicrous incident of a young officer who had taken part in the affair walking up to his colonel, who had been a calm and apparently impartial spectator, and gravely reporting: [...] "The enemy is in force just beyond this field, sir." ...|$|E
