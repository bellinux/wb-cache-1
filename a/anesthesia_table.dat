40|$|ABSTRAcr: Pulmonaryaspirationof gastriccontents is a {{significant}} source of patient morbidity, mortality, and increasedhealthcarecosts. Preventionby identifyingpatients at risk for aspirationand initiating prophylaxisis the most effective methodof reducing complications as-sociatedwith aspirationpneumonitis. Hz-receptorantagonistsare among the best prophylacticagents becauseof their efficacyin reducinggastric acidityand their convenienceof administration. DICPAnnPharmacother 1990; 24 (suppl) :S 12 ~. PULMONARY ASPIRAnON OF GASI'RlCCONTENTS is a signifi-cant causeof morbidity and mortality in patients in the in-tensive care unit (K'U), Approximately 45 years ago Mendelson published his clinical observations of an "asth-ma-like " syndrome that developed in obstetric patients who aspirated gastric contents while receiving general <b>anesthesia</b> (<b>Table</b> 1). 1 Basedon Mendelson'sobservation...|$|E
50|$|Overall, the {{available}} professionals {{at the end}} of HSDP III compared to the HSDP III targets shows that the target has been met for community level and most of MLHP. The number has also significantly increased compared to the levels in the previous HSDP. However, there is still major gap with regard to medical doctors, midwives and <b>anesthesia</b> professionals (See <b>Table</b> below) especially when one takes into account the long lead time and limited involvement of private sector in training of these professionals.|$|R
50|$|Several {{research}} activities include surgical experiences with different animals. There are two operating and experimental rooms covering 90 m2 equipped with technology for animal instrumentation and experimentation. There is an animal {{house with a}} covered area of 432 m2 and one computer lab for signal processing and another for hardware development. Other equipments are available including operating <b>tables,</b> <b>anesthesia</b> equipment, monitors, ecography, sonomicrometers, oscilloscopes, defibrillators, PC computers with acquisition systems, respirators, infusion pumps, extracorporeal pump, doppler velocimeter, digital viscometer, oximeters, invasive pressure, diameter and flow velocity transducers. For studies in patients, there is a room for clinical studies in the Hypertension Section of the Favaloro Foundation.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: A twin neurosurgical {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) suite with 3 -T intraoperative MRI (iMRI) was developed {{to be available to}} neurosurgeons for iMRI and for independent use by radiologists. METHODS: The suite was designed with one area dedicated to neurosurgery and the other to performing MRI under surgical conditions (sterility and <b>anesthesia).</b> The operating <b>table</b> is motorized, enabling transfer of the patient into the MRI system. These two areas can function independently, allowing the MRI area to be used for nonsurgical cases. We report the findings from the first 21 patients to undergo scheduled neurosurgery with iMRI in this suite (average age, 51 +/- 24 yr; intracranial tumor, 18 patients; epilepsy surgery, 3 patients). RESULTS: Twenty-six iMRI examinations were performed, 3 immediately before surgical incision, 9 during surgery (operative field partially closed), and 14 immediately postsurgery (operative field fully closed but patient still anesthetized and draped). Minor technical dysfunctions prolonged 10 iMRI procedures; however, no serious iMRI-related incidents occurred. Twenty-three iMRI examinations took an average of 78 +/- 20 minutes to perform. In three patients, iMRI led to further tumor resection because removable residual tumor was identified. Complete tumor resection was achieved in 15 of the 18 cases. CONCLUSION: The layout of the new complex allows open access to the 3 -T iMRI system except when it is in use under surgical conditions. Three patients benefited from the iMRI examination to achieve total resection. No permanent complications were observed. Therefore, the 3 -T iMRI is feasible and appears to be a safe tool for intraoperative surgical planning and assessment...|$|R
40|$|Background: Prone {{position}} {{is commonly used}} to provide surgical access {{to a variety of}} surgeries. In view of the advantages of induction of anesthesia in the prone position, we conducted a randomized study to evaluate and compare ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and i-gel in the prone position. Materials and Methods: Totally, 40 patients of either sex as per American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II, between 16 and 60 years of age, scheduled to undergo surgery in prone position were included in the study. After the patients positioned themselves prone on the operating <b>table,</b> <b>anesthesia</b> was induced by the standard technique. LMA ProSeal was used as an airway conduit in group 1 while i-gel was used in group 2. At the end of surgery, the airway device was removed in the same position. Results: Insertion of airway device was successful in first attempt in 16, and 17 cases in ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) and i-gel groups, respectively. A second attempt was required to secure the airway in 4 and 3 patients in PLMA and i-gel groups, respectively. The mean insertion time was 21. 8 ± 2. 70 s for group 1 and 13. 1 ± 2. 24 s for group 2, the difference being statistically significant (P < 0. 05). The mean seal pressure in group 1 was 36 ± 6. 22 cm H 2 O and in group 2 was 25. 4 ± 3. 21 cm H 2 O. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0. 05). 13 patients in group 1 had fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) grade 1 while it was 6 for group 2. The remaining patients in both groups had FOB grade 2. Conclusion: Insertion of supraglottic airways and conduct of anesthesia with them is feasible in the prone position. The PLMA has a better seal while insertion is easier with i-gel...|$|R
