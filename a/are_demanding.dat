25|$|Economic {{growth has}} become much more modest since the late 1990s.

To keep growing, the Taiwanese economy must abandon its workforce intensive industries, which cannot compete with China, Vietnam or other sub-developed countries, and keep innovating and investing in information technology. Since the 1990s, Taiwanese companies have been permitted to invest in China, {{and a growing number of}} Taiwanese businessmen <b>are</b> <b>demanding</b> easier communications between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.|$|E

Druze and Circassian men are liable, by agreement with their community leaders. Members of the exempted groups can still volunteer, but very few do, except for the Bedouin where a relatively large number of men have tended to volunteer. The Israeli Jewish population and especially the secular Israeli Jewish population, is currently the only population group in Israel that has a mandatory military conscription for both men and women—a fact that has caused much resentment from within the Jewish community towards the non-serving population, some of which <b>are</b> <b>demanding</b> that all the Israeli citizens share an equal amount of responsibilities, whether in the Israeli army or as part of Sherut Leumi.|$|E

25|$|The OLF {{believes}} that solidarity and cooperation among the oppressed peoples led by their respective forces {{is essential for}} realization of their common objectives of liberation.

The OLF believes the alignment of the Ethiopian government with forces resisting genuine change in Ethiopia is posing a real threat to the oppressed and subjugated peoples in the country.

It states that the Ethio-Eritrean conflict is going to directly affect the oppressed nations and nationalities economically and in terms of human casualty, and continuation of suppression and violation of human rights by creating pretexts connected with the war situation. The OLF is prepared to revitalize and strengthen previous agreements concluded with some organizations of oppressed peoples and work towards a formation of a platform to co-ordinate and channel their human and material resources to meet the challenge of the day.|$|E

50|$|In economics, a {{complementary}} good or complement {{is a good}} with a negative cross elasticity of demand, {{in contrast to a}} substitute good. This means a good's <b>demand</b> <b>is</b> increased when the price of another good is decreased. Conversely, the demand for a good is decreased when the price of another good is increased. If goods A and B are complements, an increase in the price of A will result in a leftward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift in; less of each good will <b>be</b> <b>demanded.</b> A decrease in price of A will result in a rightward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve B to shift outward; more of each good will <b>be</b> <b>demanded.</b> Basically this means that since the demand of one good is linked to the demand of another good, if a higher quantity <b>is</b> <b>demanded</b> of one good, a higher quantity will also <b>be</b> <b>demanded</b> of the other, and if a lower quantity <b>is</b> <b>demanded</b> of one good, a lower quantity will <b>be</b> <b>demanded</b> of the other. The prices of complementary goods are related in the same way: if the price of one good rises, so will the price of the other, and vice versa. With substitute goods, however, the price and quantity demanded of one good is related inversely to the price and quantity demanded of a substitute good, meaning that if the price or quantity demanded of one good rises, the price or quantity demanded of its substitute will fall.|$|R
