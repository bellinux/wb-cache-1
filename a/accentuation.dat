5000|$|His {{monograph}} entitled [...] "Psychopathy and <b>Accentuations</b> of Character of Teenagers" [...] (1977) {{has become}} an indispensable textbook for many generations of Russian psychiatrists and psychologists. For writing this book, Andrey Lichko was awarded the Honorary Certificate n.a. V.M. Bekhterev by USSR Academy of Medical Sciences. In this monograph, Andrey Lichko has enriched the theory of psychopathy (what is known today as personality disorders) by demonstrating that along with psychopathy {{it is necessary to}} distinguish the so-called <b>accentuations</b> of character. Lichko's typology has parallels with those of Karl Leonhard and Pyotr Gannushkin.|$|R
25|$|The {{number of}} words of this class is small. The words are of the third <b>accentuation</b> pattern; one word, šuõ – dog, is of the fourth and has sg. inst. -imì.

40|$|The {{article is}} based on the {{strategy}} and prospect development concept of marketing relations. It is noted that the role of personal marketing communication, particularly personal sales, is increased in the field of marketing relations. The necessity of searching for the new effective tools of personal sales has been shown, one of which is the competency model of personal agents. It is considered that in order to demonstrate many competencies that make up the contemporary model, a personal agent has to create a psychological profile of the client. The theories are based upon the methods of creating a psychological portrait of the client that have been listed. It is noted that the fourth facet of psychological portrait of the client should be based on the theory of personal character <b>accentuations.</b> The algorithm of work with clients having different character <b>accentuations</b> has been developed. The traits of clients with different character <b>accentuations</b> are detailed. The following traits of the clients are referred to: communication and behavior features, positive character traits, negative character traits, clothing, facial expressions and gestures, speech. Recommendations for work with clients of hyperthermia, anxious, dysthymic, pedantic, excitable, emotive, sticking, demonstrative, cyclothymiacs and ecstatic types have been suggested. It is noted that the consideration of character <b>accentuations</b> of the clients allows increasing the level of subjective well-being of clients and promotes the growth of the main indicators characterizing the effectiveness of personal sales in the context of relationship marketing...|$|R

5000|$|Lichko {{created his}} own {{personality}} typology {{on the basis}} of works by Pyotr Gannushkin and Karl Leonhard.

5000|$|Persons with <b>accentuations</b> of {{character}} are placed somewhere between mentally sane persons and psychopaths (those {{who suffer from}} different personality disorders). Referring to the famous monograph by the German psychiatrist Karl Leonhard, [...] "Accentuated Persons", Andrey Lichko emphasized {{that it is more}} correct to use the term [...] "accentuations {{of character}}" [...] instead of the term [...] "accentuated personality" [...] because personality appears to be a wider notion, which includes IQ, skills, worldview, and so on.|$|R
25|$|Some {{spaces of}} the tables are not filled, {{but this does not}} mean that there are no words which would fit. The sounds a, e (end-firm when stressed) and i, u (short) can not be start-firm and {{consequently}} the word having them in the next-to-last stressed syllable can not be of the first and the third <b>accentuation</b> pattern. Some of the declensional types include few words, for example there are only two words of the third <b>accentuation</b> pattern in the fifth declension: sūnùs and lietùs. The number of words (Dictionary of contemporary Lithuanian language / Dabartinės Lietuvių kalbos žodynas; the fourth issue, 2000) of the declensional patterns can be checked in the section above.|$|E

ANCA can be divided into four patterns when visualised by IF; cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA), C-ANCA (atypical), perinuclear ANCA (p-ANCA) and atypical ANCA (a-ANCA), also known as x-ANCA. c-ANCA shows cytoplasmic granular fluorescence with central interlobular <b>accentuation.</b> c-ANCA (atypical) shows cytoplasmic staining that is usually uniform and has no interlobular <b>accentuation.</b> p-ANCA has three subtypes, classical p-ANCA, p-ANCA without nuclear extension and granulocyte specific-antinuclear antibody (GS-ANA). Classical p-ANCA shows perinuclear staining with nuclear extension, p-ANCA without nuclear extension has perinuclear staining without nuclear extension and GS-ANA shows nuclear staining on granulocytes only. a-ANCA often shows combinations of both cytoplasmic and perinuclear staining.|$|E
