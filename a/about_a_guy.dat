500|$|The Chicago Tribune Michael Phillips wrote, [...] "Up in the Air is a slickly crafted disappointment. [...] feels {{tailor-made}} for George Clooney, {{who is very}} good. But the stakes remain frustratingly low and it's one of those contemporary middlebrow projects that asks us to root for a genial, shallow individual as he learns {{to be a little}} less the man he was." [...] Julian Sancton of Vanity Fair wrote, [...] "There are two movies in Up in the Air: one <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> who's flying around the country firing people, and one about a commitment-phobe who's flying away from responsibility and a shot at true love, as embodied by Farmiga. There is no attempt to braid these two threads together, and that's where the movie feels unsatisfying." [...] J. Hoberman of The Village Voice wrote, [...] "Like Juno, Up in the Air conjures a troubling reality and then wishes it away. The filmmakers have peeked into the abyss and averted their eyes... warns that you can't go home again – and then, full of false cheer and false consciousness, pretends you can." ...|$|E

[...] Lead singer Bono had read both novels and {{wanted to try to}} write [...] "a story in the mind of a killer".

500|$|Though Reitman {{has claimed}} in countless {{interviews}} {{that he wrote}} the parts specifically for George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Danny McBride, Melanie Lynskey, Amy Morton, Sam Elliott and Zach Galifianakis, some of the actors publicly stated their confusion in Reitman's assertion, if only because they knew he was meeting with other actors all along including his choice to fill his last lead role with Ellen Page (who starred in Reitman's previous film Juno) for the part that Kendrick ultimately played. On the part played by Farmiga, he cited her ability to walk {{a fine line between}} aggressiveness and femininity.

Speaking about the role, Dinklage noted that usually [...] "roles written for someone my size are a little flat"—often either comical or [...] "sort of Lord of the Rings" [...] type characters filled with wisdom; further: [...] "They're not sexual, they're not romantic" [...] and [...] "they're not flawed". What attracted him to the character McCarthy had written was that it was not one of the stereotypical roles people with dwarfism play; rather, McBride has [...] "romantic feelings" [...] as well as [...] "anger and ... flaws". The role earned him the Independent Spirit Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor nominations. In the New York Observer, reviewer Andrew Sarris wrote, [...] "Dinklage projects both size and intelligence in the fascinating reticence of his face." [...] Besides being Dinklage's highest-rated film on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, The Station Agent was modestly successful at the box office, earning over $8 million against its small budget.|$|E

500|$|Wizards & Warriors has {{received}} scant coverage from modern video gaming websites. Video gaming website GamesRadar named the opening {{theme for the}} game as [...] "Game music of the day", noting that the theme [...] "suggests, from the moment {{you turn on the}} game, that knights, wizards, goblins and who knows what else are about to collide in a battle so epic it's destined for a Frazetta painting." [...] JC Fletcher from Joystiq called the game [...] "a simple action-platformer <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> in thick armor who kicks open treasure chests in order to bribe knights". He also notes the variety of good and bad items such as the [...] "Staff of Power" [...] which inflicts much damage to enemies and conversely the [...] "Cloak of Darkness", which he says [...] "makes Kuros invisible to you but not to enemies". He said that the game has an arcade feel, with unlimited continues, a high-score list, name entry for high scores, and good music. Houston Press Jef Rouner lauded the game's music and animation, and noted its high difficulty level, especially during boss battles. IGN listed Wizards & Warriors at #56 on its [...] "Top 100 NES Games" [...] list, reviewer Sam Claiborn said that the game was inspired by Dungeons & Dragons-type RPGs, but it went further in incorporating action platforming elements along with more traditional RPG elements.

500|$|Critics {{likened the}} episode to Seinfeld and Ellen; Tom Feran in The Plain Dealer wrote that it traded [...] "vaguely and less {{successfully}} on the hanging-out style of Seinfeld", and Ann Hodges of the Houston Chronicle called it [...] "the new Seinfeld wannabe, {{but it will}} never be as funny as Seinfeld. Even as Seinfeld is now, which isn't as funny as it used to be". Hodges criticized the [...] "stiflingly dull social circle" [...] as [...] "short to the point of painful in brainpower". Robert Bianco in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that the [...] "constant comic bantering grows a little tired, just as it would if it ever actually happened in real life", and questioned why the six characters had so much free time to talk about dates. In the Los Angeles Daily News, Ray Richmond, who had also seen the following two episodes, called the cast a [...] "likeable, youth ensemble" [...] with [...] "good chemistry". He added that while Friends was [...] "one of the brighter comedies of the new season", the pilot was [...] "very weak". Diane Holloway for the Austin American-Statesman questioned Friends billing as a [...] "sophisticated comedy", writing, [...] "What's sophisticated <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> who dreams his penis is a telephone?" [...] She called the scene where Monica discovers Paul's impotence was a lie the least funny part of the episode, though conceded that the episode as a whole did have some funny moments. [...] Robert P. Laurence wrote in The San Diego Union-Tribune that [...] "A lot happens, but you'll still get the feeling you've seen Friends before", calling it [...] "Seinfeld Plus Two. Or Ellen Plus Five." [...] In the Chicago Sun-Times, Ginny Holbert rated the episode three stars, and wrote [...] "The clever series [...] stars an appealing group of actors who are just a bit funnier and better-looking than your average friend" [...] but that Joey and Rachel's characteristics were under-developed.|$|E
500|$|According to MTV News, {{the song}} [...] "touches on Drake {{reaction}} to fame and stardom". Drake told MTV News, that {{the song was}} [...] "definitely" [...] a choice of his for releasing as a single, {{and that it was}} a song he did for himself. [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the song, [...] "a prideful track <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> who fought for notoriety, gained it, and now struggles with what comes with it: criticism, groupies, and the pressure of expected greatness." [...] The song makes heavy use of an orchestral backdrop, while Drake delivers confident, aggressive raps in a paced fashion. Drake makes references to film critics Roger Ebert & Richard Roeper, as well as actress Jada Pinkett Smith and her 1996 film, Set It Off. According to Michael Craggg of MusicOMH, the song contains three hooks. Several lines in the second verse are actually a flip of hip-hop group Dead Prez's [...] "Hip-Hop", from their 2000 debut, Let's Get Free. Ironically, Dead Prez's track is meant as a jab at media controlled artists like Drake, stating, [...] "One thing about music when it hits you feel no pain/ White folks say it controls your brain/ I know better than that/ It's just game", to which Drake stated when asked about it, [...] "I love that flow. So I took that flow and flipped it in the second verse." [...] He also references Michael Jackson's iconic attire in his [...] "Thriller" [...] video, though the lines, [...] "'Bout to go 'Thriller' Mike Jackson on these niggas/ All I need is a fucking red jacket with some zippers." [...] On the reference, Drake said, [...] "That was sort of my reference point; that phenomenon of Michael. He was young and had the world excited and anticipating his every move. That was my homage to him and the impact that he had on the world that I live in. It's also ... great for people to say. Especially, unfortunately what happened to him, just to honor him was great." ...|$|E
