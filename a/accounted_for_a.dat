5|$|In 1977, Polish {{paleontologist}} Teresa Maryańska {{proposed that}} the complex sinuses and nasal cavities of ankylosaurs may have lightened {{the weight of the}} skull, housed a nasal gland, or acted as a chamber for vocal resonance. Carpenter rejected these hypotheses, arguing that tetrapod animals make sounds through the larynx, not the nostrils, and that reduction in weight was minimal, as the spaces only <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> small percent of the skull volume. He also considered a gland unlikely, and noted that the sinuses may not have had any specific function. It is also been suggested that the respiratory passages were used to perform a mammal-like treatment of inhaled air, based on the presence and arrangement of specialized bones.|$|E

5|$|Chikka Devaraja (r. 1672–1704), {{the most}} notable of Mysore's early kings, who ruled during much of this period, managed to not only survive the exigencies but further {{expanded}} territory. He achieved this by forging strategic alliances with the Marathas and the Mughals. The kingdom soon grew to include Salem and Bangalore to the east, Hassan to the west, Chikkamagaluru and Tumkur {{to the north and}} the rest of Coimbatore to the south. Despite this expansion, the kingdom, which now <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fair share of land in the southern Indian heartland, extending from the Western Ghats to the western boundaries of the Coromandel plain, remained landlocked without direct coastal access. Chikka Devaraja's attempts to remedy this brought Mysore into conflict with the Nayaka chiefs of Ikkeri and the kings (Rajas) of Kodagu (modern Coorg); who between them controlled the Kanara coast (coastal areas of modern Karnataka) and the intervening hill region respectively. The conflict brought mixed results with Mysore annexing Periyapatna but suffering a reversal at Palupare.|$|E
5|$|Dowding saw 12 Group as the {{protector}} of the Midlands and a reserve for 11 Group. Mallory and Bader wanted to ignore both the defence of the Midlands and keeping a reserve in order to commit 12 Group to battle. In essence, they proposed the opposite of Dowding and resolved to commit the reserves before the front-line units. While this method might have spared 11 Group, it had its problems. Although Mallory and Bader wanted to stop the enemy before it hit RAF airfields, {{the amount of time}} it took to position large formations for interception meant that the Big Wing often failed to achieve this. Instead, they engaged the enemy as he withdrew. Prompted by a supporting comment from Leigh-Mallory, to the effect that it did not matter when an interception was made, as long as it <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> large number of enemy aircraft, Bader announced that he would rather destroy 50 German bombers after hitting their targets than 10 before. The argument was strong; crippling losses would act as a deterrent, so that damage sustained on an occasion when the Germans did get through would have to be offset against later occasions when they did not even care to try.|$|E
5|$|From autumn 1943 the Japanese {{government}} took further steps {{to prepare the}} country's major cities for air attacks. An air defense general headquarters was established in November and a program of demolishing large numbers of buildings in major cities to create firebreaks began the next month. By {{the end of the}} war 614,000 housing units had been destroyed to clear firebreaks; these <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fifth of all housing losses in Japan during the war and displaced 3.5 million people. The government also encouraged old people, children and women in cities that were believed likely to be attacked to move to the countryside from December 1943, and a program of evacuating entire classes of schoolchildren was implemented. By August 1944, 330,000 schoolchildren had been evacuated in school groups and another 459,000 had moved to the countryside with their family. Little was done to disperse industrial facilities to make them less vulnerable to attack, however, as this was logistically difficult.|$|E

5|$|In 1197, Hubert Walter, who was Archbishop of Canterbury and Justiciar, {{appointed}} William to {{the administration}} of the royal stannaries, or tin mines, and in 1198 William was placed in charge of tin production, an office later known as the Lord Warden of the Stannaries. Under his control the mines became much more lucrative for the king, and <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> total of £1100 in William's first year of administration. As part of his administrative work he became the first warden of Lydford Castle after it was constructed in the 1190s. In 1199 he was involved in a dispute over the stannaries with another official, Hugh Bardulf, temporarily losing control of them– along with his office as sheriff– in 1200. The reason for the loss of these offices is uncertain. After restoration to office, he remained as Lord Warden of the Stannaries until 1215.|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, the 9th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron {{returned}} from a six-month tour in Afghanistan. Its 9 B-1Bs flew 770 sorties, {{the most of any}} B-1B squadron on a single deployment. The squadron spent 9,500 hours airborne, keeping one of its bombers in the air at all times. They <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> quarter of all combat aircraft sorties over the country during that time and fulfilled an average of two to three air support requests per day. On 4 September 2013, a B-1B participated in a maritime evaluation exercise, deploying munitions such as laser-guided 500lb GBU-54 bombs, 500lb and 2,000lb Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), and Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM). The aim was to detect and engage several small craft using existing weapons and tactics developed from conventional warfare against ground targets; the B-1 is seen as a useful asset for maritime duties such as patrolling shipping lanes.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in the Middle East in late November, the {{battalion}} undertook further training near Gaza in Palestine, {{before moving to}} Port Said in mid-December to relieve the garrison there. Returning to Palestine in early January they conducted a number of exercises until late February. In March 1941 {{the battalion}}s of the 9th Division were sent into the desert to relieve the 6th Division that was deploying to Greece; {{as part of this}} the 2/17th garrisoned Mersa Brega, near Tripoli. Shortly after this, the Germans landed forces in Africa to reinforce the Italians and the British forces in Libya were forced to retreat from Benghazi to the strategically important port town of Tobruk. The 2/17th fell back as part of the general retreat and subsequently took part in the defence of Tobruk, remaining there for almost seven months during which time the battalion's personnel alternated between conducting patrols in no man's land, raiding, occupying the main defensive position and working in the rear areas. On the night of 13/14 April 1941, a party of about 30 Germans broke into the Australian position and set up eight machine-guns, a couple of mortars and two field guns. Seeing this, the nearest platoon commander, Lieutenant Austin Mackell, launched a counterattack with a small party of men consisting of one corporal and five soldiers. Covered by fire from a position on their flank, the small party was able to successfully attack the position, and as a result, Corporal John Edmondson, who single-handedly <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> number of Germans despite being mortally wounded, was later posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the nation's highest military decoration. It was the first such award to a member of the 2nd AIF. The battalion's losses during the fighting around Tobruk, including the withdrawal prior to the siege, consisted of 32 dead from all causes, 127 wounded and 14 captured.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} 12 January that Dukovac added to his tally, a Yakovlev Yak-1. On 25 February, Dukovac flew five sorties. On the first he and his wingman downed a Yak-1 each, and on the second he shot down a Yak and a P-39. During his fifth mission, he was shot down by P-39s and crash-landed, {{injuring}} his spine. He was evacuated to a field hospital, but returned to 15./JG 52 {{as soon as he}} could walk, ten days later, only to find that he had just three pilots fit for duty. Despite the pending arrival of newly trained pilots, the loss of another two pilots by mid-March led the Luftwaffe to decide that attempting to maintain 15./JG 52 was futile, and the men were sent home to the NDH. During its three tours, the Staffel had <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> total of 297 Soviet aircraft, of which Dukovac had 37 confirmed and eight unconfirmed aerial victories, seven of which were later confirmed. At the beginning of July, the Luftwaffe reconsidered its decision, and the newly promoted Hauptmann Dukovac and a group of veteran and fresh pilots began to make their way back to the Eastern Front. They were transported to Romania and then the Slovak Republic, but no aircraft were provided, and on 21 July the pilots were advised that the HZL was to be disbanded. Despite this, in August they were moved to an airfield in East Prussia, where they took delivery of ten Bf 109G-14s. At the beginning of September they flew to Lithuania in preparation to rejoin the fray.|$|E
5|$|Oil {{has been}} pumped {{from the bay}} since 1912, but fishing has been a {{mainstay}} since humans have inhabited the area. In the early 1970s, recreational fishing <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> yearly input of $17million to the local economy, while commercial fishermen contributed $27.3 million. Commercial oyster farming was common in the bay until 1995, when the Texas Department of State Health Services suspended the practice, due to an unhealthy annual average zinc level of nearly 2500mg/kg in oysters, which as filter feeders, are affected by high levels of zinc in the water. The excessive zinc {{is believed to have}} been dumped into the bay by the American Smelting and Refining Company's Encycle Texas Incorporated subsidiary, which operated a zinc refinery at the site from 1942 to 1985. The Nueces Bay Power Station is also believed to have discharged zinc used for coolant until December 2002. Since that time, zinc levels in the bay have been reduced to slightly under 1000mg/kg, which remains above the healthy levels of 700mg/kg. The power station has since come under the control of the Topaz Power Group. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has established the Total Maximum Daily Load Program to measure the level of pollutants throughout the Nueces watershed, in an effort to restore the bay to safe levels of contaminants. Pesticides that seep into the bay from the heavy agricultural activity on the north shore can also spur adverse environmental effects.|$|E
5|$|The ground {{offensive}} for Kerch {{opened on}} 8 May but almost immediately, III./JG52 (with Graf on 90 victories) {{was sent back}} to Kharkov, to counter a major Soviet offensive there. The air conflict was intense and in the first two days (13–14 May 1942), Graf shot down thirteen aircraft, which included his 100th victory. He became the seventh Luftwaffe pilot to achieve that milestone. It is an illustration of his dominance within his Gruppe, and the Luftwaffe tactical doctrine of ace versus wingman. In {{the first six months of}} 1942 Graf alone <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> quarter of all the aircraft shot down by III./ JG52 It was the culmination of a remarkable seventeen days since his return to the front in which he had shot down 47 aircraft. He was awarded the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross on 17 May 1942 for achieving 104 victories. Only two days later, his score now at 106, he was notified that he was also to receive the Swords to his Knight's Cross. On 24 May, Graf and Leutnant Adolf Dickfeld of 7./JG52, flew to the Eastern Front headquarters at Rastenburg in Poland (the Wolf's Lair), for the official Oak Leaves and Swords presentation by Adolf Hitler the next day. Dickfeld was presented with the Oakleaves, having been awarded it on 19 May for achieving 101 victories after he shot down eleven aircraft on 18 May.|$|E
