5|$|Urinary {{catheterization}} {{increases the}} risk for urinary tract infections. The risk of bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine) is between three and six percent per day and prophylactic antibiotics are not effective in decreasing symptomatic infections. The risk of an associated infection can be decreased by catheterizing only when necessary, using <b>aseptic</b> technique for insertion, and maintaining unobstructed closed drainage of the catheter.|$|E
5|$|People {{with poor}} {{clinical}} grade on admission, acute neurologic deterioration, or progressive enlargement of ventricles on CT scan are, in general, indications for {{the placement of}} an external ventricular drain by a neurosurgeon. The external ventricular drain may be inserted at the bedside or in the operating room. In either case, strict <b>aseptic</b> technique must be maintained during insertion. In people with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage the EVD is used to remove cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and blood byproducts that increase intracranial pressure and may increase the risk for cerebral vasospasm.|$|E
5|$|Patients with {{abortive}} polio infections recover completely. In {{those who}} develop only <b>aseptic</b> meningitis, the symptoms {{can be expected}} to persist for two to ten days, followed by complete recovery. In cases of spinal polio, if the affected nerve cells are completely destroyed, paralysis will be permanent; cells that are not destroyed, but lose function temporarily, may recover within four to six weeks after onset. Half the patients with spinal polio recover fully; one-quarter recover with mild disability, and the remaining quarter are left with severe disability. The degree of both acute paralysis and residual paralysis is likely to be proportional to the degree of viremia, and inversely proportional to the degree of immunity. Spinal polio is rarely fatal.|$|E
5|$|Known as viremia, the {{presence}} of a virus in the bloodstream enables it to be widely distributed throughout the body. Poliovirus can survive and multiply within the blood and lymphatics for long periods of time, sometimes as long as 17 weeks. In a small percentage of cases, it can spread and replicate in other sites, such as brown fat, the reticuloendothelial tissues, and muscle. This sustained replication causes a major viremia, and leads to the development of minor influenza-like symptoms. Rarely, this may progress and the virus may invade the central nervous system, provoking a local inflammatory response. In most cases, this causes a self-limiting inflammation of the meninges, the layers of tissue surrounding the brain, which is known as nonparalytic <b>aseptic</b> meningitis. Penetration of the CNS provides no known benefit to the virus, and is quite possibly an incidental deviation of a normal gastrointestinal infection. The mechanisms by which poliovirus spreads to the CNS are poorly understood, but it appears to be primarily a chance event—largely independent of the age, gender, or socioeconomic position of the individual.|$|E
5|$|Other {{plants that}} are {{considered}} to be protocarnivorous have sticky trichomes on some surface, such as the flower scape and bud of Stylidium and Plumbago, the bracts of Passiflora foetida, and leaves of Roridula. The trichomes of Stylidium, which appear below the flower, have been known to trap and kill small insects since their discovery several centuries ago, but their purpose remained ambiguous. In November 2006, Dr. Douglas Darnowski published a paper describing the active digestion of proteins when they come in contact with a trichome of a Stylidium species grown in <b>aseptic</b> tissue culture, proving that the plant, rather than the surface microbes, was the source of protease production. Darnowski asserts in that paper that given this evidence, Stylidium species are properly called carnivorous, though in order to fulfill the strict definition of carnivory it needs to be proven that they are capable of absorbing nutrients derived from prey and that this adaptation gives the plants some competitive advantage.|$|E

25|$|Milk is sold {{in glass}} bottles (220 mL), cartons (236 mL and 1L), plastic jugs (2 liters) and <b>aseptic</b> cartons (250mL).|$|E
25|$|Side-effects such as rash, fever, {{and fatigue}} are very serious, {{as they may}} {{indicate}} incipient Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS syndrome or <b>aseptic</b> meningitis.|$|E
25|$|UHT milk {{is mostly}} sold in <b>aseptic</b> cartons (500mL, 1L, 2L), and non-UHT in 1L plastic bags or plastic bottles. Milk, UHT is {{commonly}} boiled, despite being pasteurized.|$|E
25|$|Sold in cartons (180mL, 200mL, 500mL 900mL, 1L, 1.8L, 2.3L), plastic jugs (1L and 1.8L), <b>aseptic</b> cartons (180 mL and 200 mL) {{and plastic}} bags (1 L).|$|E
25|$|Distributed most {{commonly}} in <b>aseptic</b> cartons {{for up to}} 1 liter, but smaller, snack-sized cartons are also popular. The most common flavors, besides the natural presentation, are chocolate, strawberry and vanilla.|$|E
25|$|More rare manifestations are acute confusional state, Guillain–Barré syndrome, <b>aseptic</b> meningitis, {{autonomic}} disorder, demyelinating syndrome, mononeuropathy (which might manifest as mononeuritis multiplex), {{movement disorder}} (more specifically, chorea), myasthenia gravis, myelopathy, cranial neuropathy and plexopathy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aseptic</b> {{meningitis}} (sometimes called steroid-responsive meningitis) {{has been}} diagnosed {{in increasing numbers}} in the Norwegian Toller population in recent years. Symptoms include intensive neck pain, fever, and lethargy. Prevalence is estimated at 2.5% in the Norwegian population.|$|E
25|$|Before {{vaccination}} approximately 10 {{percent of}} cases of <b>aseptic</b> meningitis were due to mumps. The symptoms would generally resolve within 10 days. Infection of the brain itself (encephalitis) occurs in between 0.02% and 0.3% of cases.|$|E
25|$|UHT milk (trajno mlijeko/trajno mleko/трајно млеко) {{is sold in}} 500mL and 1L (sometimes also 200 mL) <b>aseptic</b> cartons. Non-UHT {{pasteurized milk}} (svježe mlijeko/sveže mleko/свеже млеко) is most {{commonly}} sold in 1L and 1.5L PET bottles, though in Serbia one can still find milk in plastic bags.|$|E
25|$|He {{was noted}} {{throughout}} the profession for his early adoption of <b>aseptic</b> techniques {{and for his}} belief in the value of Vitamin E in the treatment and prevention of circulatory conditions. He frequently prescribed Vitamin E not just to animals in his care but their owners also.|$|E
25|$|During an outbreak, a {{diagnosis}} {{can be made}} by determining recent exposure and parotitis. However, when the disease incidence is low, other infectious causes of parotitis should be considered such as HIV, coxsackievirus, and influenza. Some viruses such as enteroviruses may cause <b>aseptic</b> meningitis that is very clinically similar to mumps.|$|E
25|$|Neurological involvements {{range from}} <b>aseptic</b> {{meningitis}} to vascular thrombosis such as dural sinus thrombosis and organic brain syndrome manifesting with confusion, seizures, and memory loss. Sudden hearing loss (Sensorineural) is {{often associated with}} it. They often appear late in the progression of the disease but are associated with a poor prognosis.|$|E
25|$|Saturation diving (or more precisely, {{long term}} {{exposure}} to high pressure) can potentially cause <b>aseptic</b> bone necrosis, {{although it is}} not yet known if all divers are affected or only especially sensitive ones. The joints are most vulnerable to osteonecrosis. The connection between high-pressure exposure and osteonecrosis is not fully understood.|$|E
25|$|Use as {{surgical}} {{and medical}} instruments {{as early as}} Ur, Hellenistic-era Egypt and Rome, and their use continued until largely replaced in Western countries {{in the mid to}} late 20th century by cheaper, disposable plastic items and sharper, more durable steel ones. Sterling's natural malleability is an obvious physical advantage, but it is also naturally <b>aseptic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Used {{to be sold}} in cooled 1 liter bags, {{just like}} in South Africa. Today {{the most common form}} is 1 liter <b>aseptic</b> cartons {{containing}} UHT skimmed, semi-skimmed or whole milk, although the plastic bags are still in use for pasteurized milk. Higher grades of pasteurized milk can be found in cartons or plastic bottles. Sizes other than 1 liter are rare.|$|E
25|$|Distributed in {{a variety}} of sizes, most {{commonly}} in <b>aseptic</b> cartons for up to 1.5 liters, and plastic screw-top bottles beyond that with the following volumes; 1.1L, 2L, and 3L. 1 liter milk bags are starting to appear in supermarkets, but have not yet proved popular. Most UHT-milk is packed in 1 or 2 liter paper containers with a sealed plastic spout.|$|E
25|$|The {{violations}} included {{that the}} depth of anaesthetic coma was questionable; {{that most of the}} animals were not seen by a veterinarian either before or after surgery, survival surgical techniques were not carried out in the required <b>aseptic</b> manner; that the operating theater was not properly cleaned; and that smoking was allowed in the operating theater despite the presence of oxygen tanks.|$|E
25|$|Any {{break in}} the skin carries a risk of infection. Although IV {{insertion}} is an <b>aseptic</b> procedure, skin-dwelling organisms such as Coagulase-negative staphylococcus or Candida albicans may enter through the insertion site around the catheter, or bacteria may be accidentally introduced inside the catheter from contaminated equipment. Moisture introduced to unprotected IV sites through washing or bathing substantially increases the infection risks.|$|E
25|$|Commonly sold in 500 mL {{plastic bags}} and in bottles {{in some parts}} like in west. It is still {{customary}} to serve the milk boiled, despite pasteurization. Milk is often buffalo milk. Flavored milk is sold in most convenience stores in waxed cardboard containers. Convenience stores also sell many varieties of milk (such as flavored and ultra-pasteurized) in different sizes, usually in <b>aseptic</b> cartons.|$|E
25|$|Pasteurization is {{the reason}} for milk's {{extended}} shelf life. High-temperature, short-time (HTST) pasteurized milk typically has a refrigerated shelf life of two to three weeks, whereas ultra-pasteurized milk can last much longer, sometimes two to three months. When ultra-heat treatment (UHT) is combined with sterile handling and container technology (such as <b>aseptic</b> packaging), it can even be stored unrefrigerated for up to 9 months.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the system}} uses a mixed culture of microorganisms, besides not needing any enzyme addition, the {{fermentation}} requires no sterility or <b>aseptic</b> conditions, making this front {{step in the}} process more economical than in more popular methods for the production of cellulosic ethanol. These savings in {{the front end of the}} process, where volumes are large, allows flexibility for further chemical transformations after dewatering, where volumes are small.|$|E
25|$|The {{antiseptic}} {{properties of}} phenol {{were used by}} Sir Joseph Lister (1827–1912) in his pioneering technique of antiseptic surgery. Lister decided that the wounds themselves had to be thoroughly cleaned. He then covered the wounds {{with a piece of}} rag or lint covered in phenol, or carbolic acid as he called it. The skin irritation caused by continual exposure to phenol eventually led to the introduction of <b>aseptic</b> (anti-septic, germ-free) techniques in surgery.|$|E
25|$|A relapse of {{symptoms}} may occur soon after initial treatment with IVIG. This usually requires rehospitalization and retreatment. Treatment with IVIG can cause allergic and nonallergic acute reactions, <b>aseptic</b> meningitis, fluid overload and, rarely, other serious reactions. Overall, life-threatening complications resulting from therapy for Kawasaki disease are exceedingly rare, especially {{compared with the}} risk of nontreatment. Also, evidence indicates Kawasaki disease produces altered lipid metabolism that persists beyond the clinical resolution of the disease.|$|E
25|$|Withdrawal of steroid {{medication}} {{can cause}} joint pain and diffuse muscle pain accompanied by fatigue; these symptoms resolve with recommencement of steroid therapy. Chronic steroid therapy {{can result in}} <b>aseptic</b> necrosis of the humoral or femoral head, resulting in shoulder or knee pain described as dull and aching, and reduced movement in or inability to use arm or hip. Aromatase inhibitors can cause diffuse muscle and joint pain and stiffness, and may {{increase the likelihood of}} osteoporosis and consequent fractures.|$|E
25|$|Most stores stock {{imperial}} sizes: 1 pint (568mL), 2 pints (1.136L), 4 pints (2.273L), 6 pints (3.408L) or {{a combination}} including both metric and imperial sizes. Glass milk bottles delivered to the doorstep by the milkman are typically pint-sized and are returned empty by the householder for repeated reuse. Milk is sold at supermarkets in either <b>aseptic</b> cartons or HDPE bottles. Supermarkets have also now begun to introduce milk in bags, to be poured from a proprietary jug and nozzle.|$|E
25|$|Disadvantages of {{injections}} include potential pain or discomfort for {{the patient}} and the requirement of trained staff using <b>aseptic</b> techniques for administration. However, in some cases, patients are taught to self-inject, such as SC injection of insulin in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. As the drug is delivered to the site of action extremely rapidly with IV injection, there is a risk of overdose if the dose has been calculated incorrectly, and there is an increased risk of side effects if the drug is administered too rapidly.|$|E
