The Charter also confirmed the harbour rights given earlier in 1512 and granted two weekly markets to be held on Tuesdays and Thursday; which replaced a single market previously held on Wednesdays.

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{synthesis}} of <b>artificial</b> transmission <b>lines</b> based on complementary split ring resonators (CSRRs). The considered structures are microstrip lines with CSRRs etched in the ground plane and microstrip lines loaded with both CSRRs and series capacitive gaps. An aggressive space mapping (ASM) optimization algorithm, able to automatically generate the layout of these <b>artificial</b> <b>lines,</b> has been developed. The tool has been optimized in order to achieve fast convergence and to provide accurate results. The main relevant aspects of the proposed algorithm (based on a novel two-step ASM optimization approach) are: 1) the capability to provide the implementable circuit elements of the equivalent circuit model of the considered <b>artificial</b> <b>lines</b> and 2) the ability to converge in a few (unprecedented) iteration steps, due to a new procedure to generate the initial layouts (which are very close to the final ones). First, the software is tested through the synthesis of several CSRR-based microstrip lines, and then some practical application examples of such <b>artificial</b> <b>lines</b> are reported to illustrate the potential of the proposed synthesis tool...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} recent {{advances}} in the modeling of transmission lines loaded with split ring resonators (SRRs). It {{is well known that}} these <b>artificial</b> <b>lines</b> can exhibit a negative effective permeability in a narrow band above the SRR fundamental resonance, providing stopband functionality. By introducing shunt inductive elements to the line, the stopband can be switched to a pass band with left-handed (LH) wave propagation. For the design of microwave circuits based on these <b>artificial</b> <b>lines,</b> accurate circuit models are necessary. The former circuit model of SRR-loaded lines was presented more than one decade ago and is valid under restrictive conditions. This paper presents the progress achieved in the modeling of these <b>artificial</b> <b>lines</b> during the last years. The analysis, restricted to coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission lines loaded only with SRRs (negative permeability transmission lines), includes the effects of SRR orientation, the coupling between adjacent resonators, and the coupling between the two SRRs constituting the unit cell. The proposed circuit models are validated through electromagnetic simulation and experimental data. It is also pointed out that the analysis can be easily extended to negative permittivity transmission lines based on complementary split ring resonators (CSRRs) ...|$|R

Using the bandpass structure for realizing the <b>artificial</b> transmission <b>lines,</b> this lost frequency region {{can be added to}} the upper limit of the gain-frequency band. Therefore, BP-CSSDA gives more bandwidth than CSSDA using the lowpass structured lines. The gain can be increased by increasing the interstage termination impedance (Z 0 int) without decreasing the bandwidth. A graphical method for determining the maximum Z 0 int is introduced in this paper. The simulation results given in this paper show the advantage of using the BP structured <b>artificial</b> <b>lines</b> in CSSDA...|$|R

5000|$|So far Gore's {{published}} views {{had been}} in consonance {{with those of the}} older Tractarians, but in 1890 a stir was created by the publication, under his editorship, of Lux Mundi, a series of essays by different writers attempting to bring the Christian creed into a harmonious relation to the modern growth of knowledge, scientific, historic, critical, and to modern problems of politics and ethics. Gore himself contributed an essay on [...] "The Holy Spirit and Inspiration" [...] and, from the tenth edition, one of Gore's sermons, [...] "On the Christian Doctrine of Sin", was included as an appendix. The book, which ran through twelve editions in little over a year, met with a mixed reception. Traditional clerics, both Evangelicals and Tractarians, were alarmed by views on the incarnate nature of Christ which seemed to them to impugn his divinity and, by concessions to the higher criticism in the matter of the inspiration of scripture, appeared to them to convert the [...] "impregnable rock" [...] (as Gladstone had called it) into a foundation of sand. Sceptics, however, were not impressed by a system of defence which seemed to draw an <b>artificial</b> <b>line</b> beyond which criticism was not to advance.

Campbell was tasked by AT&T to investigate the possibility of improving line quality with the use of iron-copper bimetallic cable invented by John S. Stone, another AT&T engineer. This cable of Stone's would similarly increase line inductance and had the potential to meet the Heaviside condition.
