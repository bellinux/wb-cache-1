40|$|Olfactory {{perception}} {{appears to}} be linked to personality traits. This study aimed to determine whether personality traits influence human <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>sense</b> of smell. Two-hundred participants’ <b>attitudes</b> toward their <b>senses</b> of smell and their personality traits were measured using two self-administered questionnaires: the Importance of Olfaction Questionnaire and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised (EPQ-R). Demographics and olfactory function were also assessed using a self-administered questionnaire. Gender-induced differences were present in <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>sense</b> of smell. Women participants were more dependent than men participants on olfactory cues for daily decision-making. In addition, as participants evaluated their own olfactory functions more positively, they relied more on olfactory information in everyday life. To determine a relationship between personality traits and <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>sense</b> of smell, Spearman partial correlation analyses were conducted with controlling the factors that might influence attitudes with respect to sense of smell (i. e., gender and self-awareness of olfactory function) as covariates. Participants who scoring high in lie-scale (i. e., socially desirable and faking good) tended to use olfactory cues both for daily decision-making related to social communication and product purchase. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate a significant association between personality traits and <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>sense</b> of smell...|$|R

40|$|AbstractJournal {{writing is}} a means of self expression, and has been used in many {{disciplines}} such as psychology, sociology, education and even mathematics and remains a valuable teaching/learning tool in many classrooms, because it not only teaches the students to write, it also encourages them to share their experiences and ideas. In this study a class comprising of 65 medical students were instructed to keep journals to see the level of change in the style, reflections, <b>attitudes</b> and <b>sense</b> of self. The students were instructed to reflect on being a medical student, their clinical experiences and anything that captures their attention. The students were given freedom and choice in choosing the topics and were ensured of confidentiality of their journals. The analysis of the journal contents were reported in 6 themes. The six main themes included of pedagogical, reflections on past experiences, change of <b>attitude,</b> <b>sense</b> of self, personal experiences, and worries about future career. The results indicated a change in all of the aspects of writing. The findings suggest that the process of reflection may be actively facilitated through journals...|$|R

40|$|Character {{education}} has been termed {{as a process of}} nurturing values to students to have self-reliance against God, themselves, others, environment and national awareness, which are implemented on their thought, <b>attitude,</b> <b>sense,</b> speech and action based on the norms of religion, law, ethics, culture and custom. Character education at school must involve the stakeholders. The implementation of character education is carried out through launching learning experience which is rooted from building character on students. Character education is integrated classroom practice of all subjects, which can adopt some approaches, one of which is contextual approach bringing real practice in classroom. This approach can hopefully achieve not only cognitive, but also affective and psychomotor skills...|$|R

For the Love of Dolly shows that fandom can give meaning to some people's lives, but it can also overwhelm the lives of others.|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{clinical}} {{expressions of}} prolonged grief in samples of 32 Chinese and 33 Swiss bereaved parents, {{according to the}} proposed International Classification of Diseases, 11 th Revision model of prolonged grief disorder (PGD). Sex differences and predictors (cultural <b>attitudes,</b> <b>sense</b> of coherence, and posttraumatic growth) of PGD were analyzed. In result, after controlling for sociodemographic and loss-related sample differences, both samples showed similar PGD symptom profiles, with Swiss parents exhibiting more severe grief-related preoccupation and Chinese parents exhibiting some accessory symptoms and functional impairment to a greater extent. Multivariate analyses revealed for the Chinese sample primary predictions of PGD by life satisfaction, general health and one's world view (social cynicism) and for the Swiss sample by female sex, sense of coherence, and life satisfaction. The findings substantiate the basic appropriateness of the International Classification of Diseases, 11 th Revision PGD in distinct cultural groups and may contribute {{to a better understanding}} of grief expression and its potential predictors across different cultures...|$|R

40|$|High {{performance}} Earth sensing for spin-stabilized vehicles can {{be achieved}} through a straightforward modification to a flight-proven conical Earth horizon sensor. The necessary hardware and therefore, cost and weight is essentially identical to hardware used by three-axis stabilized satellites making precision <b>attitude</b> <b>sensing</b> available to the entire spacecraft community, including small satellite builders. The Barnes Engineering Commandable Rate Scanner uses a rotating sensor on a spinning spacecraft to provide full-sky (4 x steradian) Earth coverage with a single sensor. The sensor provides data for any spacecraft attitude and altitude from LEO to above GEO. In LEO, a data rate of several hundred horizon crossings per minute is typical, allowing for extremely accurate (better than 0. 02 deg) <b>attitude</b> <b>sensing.</b> In addition, the principal biases which normally dominate attitude determination accuracy for spinning spacecraft are either eliminated or can be measured.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare teachers' {{organisational}} behaviour in publicly- and privately-funded schools in the Dutch Vocational Education and Training (VET) sector. Design/methodology/approach - A percentage of all middle managers in publicly and privately funded schools (72 per cent and 43 per cent respectively) distributed self-report questionnaires to their teachers measuring teachers' <b>attitudes,</b> <b>sense</b> of identification and perception of the school climate. The sample consisted of 705 teachers in publicly funded schools and 25 teachers in privately funded schools. Data were analysed through multilevel analysis accounting for the dependency of teachers working within the same teaching unit. Findings - The analyses show that teachers in publicly funded schools report a less curriculum-oriented <b>attitude,</b> a lower <b>sense</b> of identification, and perceive a less supportive school climate than teachers in privately funded schools. Funding did not have an effect on the extent to which teachers have a student-oriented attitude. In addition, the analyses show significant effects of teacher characteristics, the disciplinary sector, and affiliation characteristics on teachers' organisational behaviour. Research limitations/implications - The paper clearly indicates differences in teachers' organisational behaviour in publicly and privately funded schools. Contrary to common beliefs, the institutional context hardly influences the extent to which teachers have a student-oriented attitude. Originality/value - The paper contributes to insights in behavioural aspects of the fading boundary between the public and private sector...|$|R
