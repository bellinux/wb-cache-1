5000|$|Critical {{opinion was}} mixed. [...] It was {{described}} as having a [...] "somewhat leering tone", but also the [...] "best and brightest of CBS' new series" [...] {{as well as being}} a seeming extension of Colin's 1985 lawyer sitcom, the equally short-lived Foley Square (in which Colin had played an assistant district attorney). However even before its premiere, critics anticipated a quick demise due to its difficult programming slot, on Saturday nights opposite NBC's The Golden Girls and Amen. [...] Ratings were indeed dismal, as in its five weeks on the <b>air,</b> <b>Leg</b> Work was always rated within the bottom five network shows every single week.

5000|$|These are {{bladders}} or canisters of compressed air. A {{source of}} compressed air {{is required to}} maintain them. Air springs are rubber bladders which provide damping as well as isolation and are used in large trucks. Some pneumatic isolators can attain low resonant frequencies and are used for isolating large industrial equipment. Air tables consist of a working surface or optical surface mounted on <b>air</b> <b>legs.</b> These tables provide enough isolation for laboratory instrument under some conditions. Air systems may leak under vacuum conditions. The air container can interfere with isolation of low-amplitude vibration.|$|R

40|$|FY) 2016 {{document}} {{presents the}} current detailed plan {{for maintaining the}} Nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile. The FY 2016 SSMP builds upon last year’s SSMP in balancing NNSA’s investments in maintaining and modernizing the stockpile, revitalizing its physical infrastructure and workforce, and sustaining its research, development, testing, and evaluation programs. The joint DOE and Department of Defense “ 3 + 2 Strategy ” for stockpile modernization through life extension programs implemented by this SSMP provides the opportunity to continue the Administration’s commitment to maintaining a safe, secure, and effective deterrent while reducing {{the size of the}} stockpile. For example, once the B 61 - 12 life extension program is completed in FY 2025 and confidence is gained in the B 61 - 12 weapons in service, the B 83 - 1, the last megaton-class weapon in America’s nuclear arsenal, will be retired. The combination of these actions will result in a 50 percent {{reduction in the number of}} nuclear gravity bombs in the stockpile, the removal of a megaton-class weapon, an 80 percent reduction in amount of special nuclear material in the bomb portion of the <b>air</b> <b>leg,</b> and a reduction in the safety and security risks associated with the stockpile. Furthermore, consistent with life extension program plans, NNSA’s investments in plutonium will allow war-reserve-quality production of 30 plutonium pits per year by FY 2026 and 50 to 80 pits per year by 2030. Similarly, our Uranium Strategy will allow us to recapitalize critical enriched uranium operations that currently reside in outdated facilities. The plans described in this document for these essential capabilities are consistent with the requirements outlined in the FY 2015 National Defens...|$|E

60|$|The friend turns pale {{when this}} order is given, and paler still {{when it is}} {{followed}} up by a great pattering on the staircase, (not unlike the sound of rain upon a skylight,) a violent bursting open of the dining-room door, and the tumultuous appearance of six small children, closely succeeded by a strong nursery-maid with a twin in each arm. As the whole eight are screaming, shouting, or kicking-- some influenced by a ravenous appetite, some by a horror of the stranger, and some by a conflict of the two feelings--a pretty long space elapses before all their heads can be ranged round the table and anything like order restored; in bringing about which happy state of things both the nurse and footman are severely scratched. At length Mrs. Whiffler is heard to say, 'Mr. Saunders, shall I give you some pudding?' A breathless silence ensues, and sixteen small eyes are fixed upon the guest in expectation of his reply.

40|$|Background Disorders {{associated}} with excessive {{swelling of the}} lower extremities are common. They can be {{associated with}} pain, varicose veins, reduced blood pressure when standing and may cause syncope or fainting. The common physical remedy to these disorders is the use of compression stockings and pneumatic compression leg massagers, which both attempt to limit blood pooling and capillary filtration in the lower limbs. However, compression stockings provide a constant pressure, and their efficiency has been challenged according to some recent studies. <b>Air</b> compression <b>leg</b> massagers on the other hand, restricts patient mobility. In this work we therefore present an innovative active compression bandage based on the use of a smart materials technology that could produce intermittent active pressure to mitigate the symptoms of lower extremity disorders. Methods An active compression bandage (ACB), actuated by shape memory alloy (SMA) wires, was designed and prototyped. The ACB was wrapped around a calf model to apply an initial pressure comparable to the one exerted by commercial compression stockings. The ACB was controlled to apply differen...|$|R
