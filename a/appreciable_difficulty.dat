50|$|Depending on precise {{stress and}} {{environmental}} conditions, Supertherm {{can be used}} in severe applications involving service temperatures up to 2300 °F. Supertherm is manufactured by the foundry casting process and is readily weldable into assemblies using most welding processes, and can be machined without <b>appreciable</b> <b>difficulty.</b> The low coefficient of thermal expansion makes Supertherm an excellent choice for SPF platens and tooling where dimensional stability is important.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} three scientific applications {{which are}} implemented on the recently installed NEC Cenju- 3 at the Swiss Scientific Computing Center (CSCS-ETHZ) : the Laso code to simulate Newtonian flow, the molecular visualization code Molekel, and the tJ-Model code to detect superconductivity regions. These have been parallelized without <b>appreciable</b> <b>difficulty</b> using the recently finalized Message-Passing Interface (MPI) standard. For each application we supply a short problem description, discuss its parallel implementation and present the achieved performance. P. Flukiger, E. Heeb fi, N. Masuda y, W. Sawyer, C. Stern, F.

40|$|This paper {{tries to}} reveal the chief {{determinants}} of the Turkish Armed Forces’ (TAF) role in political sphere. In order to shed a light upon the “guardian” role of the TAF for the secular nation-state {{in general and the}} Kemalist ideology in particular; the historical, theoretical as well as legal and institutional traits of the military interventions in Turkey will be analyzed. As already known, Turkish military {{played a key role in}} the nationbuilding process, hence the modernization era was also stimulated by the Army. It can be argued that, having a role like this, the military elites from the very beginning of the Republican era up to present, have not been experiencing any <b>appreciable</b> <b>difficulties</b> in placing themselves in the political life. Unlike its counterparts, the Turkish Army has a considerable amount of political and institutional autonomy which ultimately leads to emphasize its role in guarding the state from “internal enemies”. This term of “internal enemy” refers to political Islam and Kurdish movement, and from time to time the TAF exercise direct and / or indirect political authority to a variety of extents. The question of why the military elites still regard themselves as the only guarantor of the Turkish state is a crucial one to be answered. The role of the civilians, the political culture, historical background, socio-cultural structure level of economic development and legal regulations of Turkey, all to some extent affect that role of the Army. Here I argue that multidimensional factors are determinant in shaping the military’s role in politics. In addition to that, by regarding the Islamic and Kurdish identities as security issues, the military gives itself the role of guardianship of the Turkish state too. The major argument of the paper is that, the Turkish Army protects the Turkish State from the Turkish nation in the context of “internal enemy” thanks to its so-called guardianship role of the Turkish State...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{determine}} the outcome for children after psychiatric intervention {{in cases of}} factitious illness by proxy.  METHODS—All 17 children from 16 families, selected for admission to the Park Hospital Oxford family unit 1992 - 96 were followed up after a mean of 27 months. Information was obtained on the children and their carers from general practitioners, social workers or both; 13 {{of the children and}} carers were interviewed.  RESULTS—All patients were at the severe end of the abuse spectrum; 12 involving direct induction of illness, 1 tampering with samples to mimic illness, and 4 fabrication of symptoms. The biological mother was the abuser in all cases. Four children and their parents had been initially admitted for assessment, and 13 for treatment to decide whether family reunification was viable. The 4 assessments clarified diagnosis, enabling improved care plans to be made. Of the 13 treatment cases, 10 were reunited with parents after a mean of 71 / 2 weeks' admission, whereas 3 were discharged to out of home care. There was a further episode of induced illness in 1 of the reunited children. Although some mothers had continuing mental health difficulties, only 1 of the other reunited cases had <b>appreciable</b> parent-child relationship <b>difficulties</b> (not requiring referral to psychiatric services). The children did well in their development, growth, and adjustment.  CONCLUSION—Family reunification is feasible for certain cases, but long term follow up is necessary to ensure the child's safety and to identify deterioration in parent's mental health. The outcome for reunited children compared well with reported untreated cases. ...|$|R
