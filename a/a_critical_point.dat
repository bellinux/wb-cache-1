This small, hard-won airfield was <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>point</b> in the entire island chain, and both military sides strategically considered that control of the airbase offered potential control of the local battle area airspace. In fact, Henderson Field and the aircraft based upon it soon resulted in telling effects on the movement of Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands and in the attrition of Japanese air forces in the South Pacific Area. Historically, Allied control of Henderson Field became the key factor in the entire battle for Guadalcanal.|$|E

5|$|With {{global warming}} causing glaciers and {{permafrost}} to melt rapidly and allowing {{a large amount}} of fresh water to flow into the oceans, there are concerns that if the amount of fresh water in the oceans reaches <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>point,</b> there will be a disruption in the thermohaline circulation. Considering the blue whale's migratory patterns are based on ocean temperature, a disruption in this circulation, which moves warm and cold water around the world, would be likely to have an effect on their migration.

5|$|Because the {{aircraft}} was fully booked, a passenger {{was allowed to}} sit in the jump seat in the cockpit. The passenger had no connection with the airline, but was granted permission by the captain via acquaintance in the airline. Several of the other passengers were employees in Widerøe and shouldaccording to the airline's rulesinstead have been seated there. From Namsos to Brønnøysund there were available seats in the cabin, but the jump seat passenger continued {{to sit in the}} cockpit. The commission felt that the passenger's conversation with the captain drew his attention and concentration away from his duties at <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>point</b> of the flight.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{with the}} aid of visual investigations that multiply reentrant liquid–liquid transitions can be obtained in ethyl alcohol (E) – water (W) mixtures, by the addition of ions. Multiplicity of reentrance can be tuned by changing the concentration, size, or the structure forming ability of the ions added. This is a route to the realization of various thermodynamic states, such as special <b>critical</b> <b>points</b> (SCPs), in the vanishing limit of reentrance. We show that in E+W+ ion systems, one can achieve <b>a</b> plait <b>point,</b> <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> double <b>point,</b> <b>a</b> double <b>critical</b> <b>point,</b> and <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> inflection <b>point,</b> in addition to <b>a</b> line of <b>critical</b> <b>points.</b> We adduce evidence for the presence of supramolecular structures and the associated nanoscopic length scale in these systems, by small angle X-ray scattering experiments. Structuring gives rise to the intriguing phase behavior and renders these systems potentially significant to study the role of supramolecular structuring on the approach to asymptotic Ising criticality near SCPs...|$|R
5|$|Mark Webster, {{an expert}} {{instructed}} by Bamber's defence team, argued that Hayward's tests had been inadequate, {{and that there}} was a real possibility, not a remote one, that the blood had come from Nevill and June. This was <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>point,</b> because the prosecution case rested on the silencer having been on the gun when Sheila was shot, something she could not have done herself because of the length of her arms. If she was shot with the silencer on the gun, it meant that someone else had shot her. If her blood was inside the silencer, it supported the prosecution's position that she had been shot by another party, but if the blood inside the silencer belonged to someone else, that part of the prosecution case collapsed.|$|E
5|$|The British {{capture of}} Martinique in 1809 marked <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>point</b> for the French on Guadeloupe; {{blockaded}} {{on all sides}} by the naval forces of the British, the French civilians and soldiers were reduced to near starvation.

Attacked on three sides at the end of January, Ernouff's force mounted a spirited, although short, defense and capitulated on 6February 1810, after which he was transported to Britain. He was repatriated to France in a prisoner exchange in 1811. Irritated at the loss of Guadeloupe to the British, Napoleon accused him of abuse of power, embezzlement, and treason. Ernouf spent 23months in captivity in France while the courts debated how to proceed.|$|E
5|$|The {{nationalisation}} of the AESC was {{the most}} prominent manifestation of Playford's economic pragmatism; although ideologically a supporter of free enterprise like his colleagues, he saw ideology as secondary if {{in the way of}} his objectives.

The struggle for Leigh Creek was seen as <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>point</b> in Playford's premiership; a second legislative failure was seen as being potentially fatal for Playford's leadership of his party, but the successful passage of the bill enhanced his image and gave himi enduring control over his party for the rest of his career, although it angered some of the staunch LCL conservatives in the upper house for some time; a significant number of them refused to talk to Playford for a substantial period of time thereafter.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel algorithm for handling occlusion in visual traffic surveillance (VTS) by geometrically splitting {{the model that}} has been fitted onto the composite binary vehicle mask of two occluded vehicles. The proposed algorithm consists of <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>points</b> detection step, <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>points</b> clustering step and a model partition step using the vanishing point of the road. The <b>critical</b> <b>points</b> detection step detects the major <b>critical</b> <b>points</b> on the contour of the binary vehicle mask. The <b>critical</b> <b>points</b> clustering step selects the best <b>critical</b> <b>points</b> among the detected <b>critical</b> <b>points</b> as the reference points for the model partition. The model partition step partitions the model by exploiting the information of the vanishing point {{of the road and}} the selected <b>critical</b> <b>points.</b> The proposed algorithm was tested on a number of real traffic image sequences, and has demonstrated that it can successfully partition the model that has been fitted onto two occluded vehicles. To evaluate the accuracy, the dimensions of each individual vehicle are estimated based on the partitioned model.
