Russia, Iran and the Persian Gulf countries were against {{the construction of the}} pipeline. The pipeline circumvents both Russia and Iran. Because it has decreased Western dependence on Middle Eastern oil, the pipeline has been <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the United States' support for Georgia.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, {{orangutan}} habitat has decreased rapidly due to logging and forest fires, {{as well as}} fragmentation by roads. <b>A</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> {{that period of time}} has been the conversion of vast areas of tropical forest to palm oil plantations in response to international demand. Palm oil is used for cooking, cosmetics, mechanics, and biodiesel. Hunting is also a major problem as is the illegal pet trade.|$|E
5|$|In May 2003, The New York Times {{reporter}} Jayson Blair {{was forced}} to resign from the newspaper after he was caught plagiarizing and fabricating elements of his stories. Some critics contended that African-American Blair's race was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> his hiring and in The New York Times initial reluctance to fire him.|$|E

5|$|Insects are <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the low {{yields of}} African cowpea crops, and they affect each tissue {{component}} and developmental {{stage of the}} plant. In bad infestations insect pressure is responsible for over 90% loss in yield. The legume pod borer, Maruca vitrata, is the main pre-harvest pest of the cowpea. Other important pests include pod sucking bugs, thrips and the post-harvest cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculatus.|$|E
5|$|MU5 was {{designed}} to be about 20 times faster than Atlas, and was optimised for running compiled programs rather than hand-written machine code, something that contemporary computers were unable to do efficiently. <b>A</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the MU5's much-improved performance over its predecessors was its incorporation of associative memory, which greatly speeded up access to its main store.|$|E
5|$|Meyerbeer's costly operas, {{requiring}} grand casts {{of leading}} singers, were gradually {{dropped from the}} repertoire in the early 20th century. They were banned in Germany from 1933, and subsequently in subject countries, by the Nazi regime because the composer was Jewish, and this was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> their further disappearance from the repertory.|$|E

5|$|A 2009 report, {{authored}} by Justice Manmohan Singh Liberhan, found that 68 people {{were responsible for}} the demolition, mostly leaders from the BJP. Among those named were Vajpayee, Advani, and Murli Manohar Joshi. The report also criticised Kalyan Singh, Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh during the demolition. He was accused of posting bureaucrats and police officers who would stay silent during the demolition. Anju Gupta, an Indian Police Service officer in charge of Advani's security, appeared as a prominent witness before the commission. She said that Advani and Joshi made provocative speeches that were <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the mob's behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Darlington {{moved to}} the all-seater, 25,000-capacity Darlington Arena in 2003. The cost of the stadium was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> driving the club into {{administration}}. In May 2012, the club was bought out of a period of administration without entering into a Creditors Voluntary Agreement (CVA). The Football Association ruled {{that it should be}} treated as a new club, which required a change of playing name. The name chosen was Darlington 1883, and that team was placed in the Northern League Division One, the ninth tier of English football, for the 2012–13 season. They won three promotions in four seasons before the FA approved their request to revert to their traditional name.|$|E

5|$|Language {{varieties}} of Toraja, including Kalumpang, Mamasa, Tae, Talondo, Toala, and Toraja-Sa'dan, {{belong to the}} Malayo-Polynesian language from the Austronesian family. At the outset, the isolated geographical nature of Tana Toraja formed many dialects between the Toraja languages themselves. After the formal administration of Tana Toraja, some Toraja dialects {{have been influenced by}} other languages through the transmigration program, introduced since the colonialism period, and it has been <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the linguistic variety of Toraja languages.|$|E
5|$|Malaria is {{not just}} a disease {{commonly}} associated with poverty: some evidence suggests that it is also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to economic development. Although tropical regions are most affected, malaria's furthest influence reaches into some temperate zones that have extreme seasonal changes. The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the slow economic development of the American southern states.|$|E

William tried to avoid abolishing Episcopacy but Dundee's 1689 Highland campaign on behalf of James highlighted his reliance on Presbyterian support. He withdrew his opposition and the measures were approved by Parliament in 1690. The Glorious Revolution in Scotland resulted in a Parliament and Kirk far more independent than before but ending Episcopacy isolated {{a significant part of}} the political class. This was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> political debates over the 1707 Act of Union and the Scottish Jacobite movement.|$|E

5|$|Pritchard {{was also}} music {{director}} of Glyndebourne Festival Opera in Sussex, and it was partly due to his influence that in 1964 the LPO replaced the RPO as Glyndebourne's resident orchestra, providing the players with stable guaranteed work in the slack summer months. The number of LPO concerts in the provinces fell during the 1960s, and ceased to be <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the orchestra's finances. During the 1960s the orchestra gave fund-raising concerts in which guests from outside the world of classical music appeared, including Danny Kaye, Duke Ellington and Tony Bennett.

5|$|The lack {{of flight}} {{recorder}} {{data for the}} last six minutes of the flight added significant complexity to the investigation and was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> its lengthy duration. The Transportation Safety Board team had to reconstruct the last six minutes of flight entirely from the physical evidence. As the aircraft was broken into 2 million pieces by the impact, this process was time-consuming and tedious. The investigation became the largest and most expensive transport accident investigation in Canadian history, costing C$57 million (US$48.5 million) over five years.|$|E
5|$|The {{victims of}} this {{poisoning}} were almost exclusively post-menopausal women with low iron and other mineral body stores.
