40|$|BACKGROUND: Mid- to late-stage {{dementia}} {{is often}} characterized by behavioural <b>and</b> psychological <b>symptoms,</b> including, {{but not limited}} to physical and verbal aggression. INTRODUCTION: Although there is a considerable research about the prevalence, aetiology, and management <b>of</b> behavioural <b>and</b> psychological <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> dementia, there is limited research about the experience of caring for people with such symptoms in long-term aged care facilities. AIM: The aims of the study were to describe: (i) nurses 2 ̆ 7 experiences of caring for people with behavioural <b>and</b> psychological <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> dementia in long-term aged care facilities, and (ii) strategies nurses used to deal with these symptoms. METHODS: A qualitative exploratory and descriptive design, involving focus group interviews with 30 nurses from three long-term aged care units in Australia. The transcripts were analysed using inductive content analysis. RESULTS: The findings revealed five interrelated themes: (i) working under difficult conditions, (ii) behavioural <b>and</b> psychological <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> dementia: an everyday encounter, (iii) making sense <b>of</b> behavioural <b>and</b> psychological <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> dementia, (iv) attempting to manage behavioural <b>and</b> psychological <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> dementia, <b>and</b> (v) feeling undervalued. CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the difficult conditions under which nurses worked and the complexity of caring for individuals who have behavioural <b>and</b> psychological <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> dementia. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: Organizational efforts to enhance the quality of care for individuals with behavioural <b>and</b> psychological <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> dementia in long-term aged care facilities should extend beyond staff education to heed nurses 2 ̆ 7 concerns about organizational barriers to interpersonal care...|$|R

5|$|Many {{people with}} Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} {{have experienced the}} signs <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> an infection in the 3–6 weeks prior to {{the onset of the}} neurological symptoms. This may consist of upper respiratory tract infection (rhinitis, sore throat) or diarrhea.|$|E
5|$|The signs <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> malaria {{typically}} begin 8–25 {{days following}} infection; however, symptoms may occur later {{in those who}} have taken antimalarial medications as prevention. Initial manifestations of the disease—common to all malaria species—are similar to flu-like symptoms, and can resemble other conditions such as sepsis, gastroenteritis, and viral diseases. The presentation may include headache, fever, shivering, joint pain, vomiting, hemolytic anemia, jaundice, hemoglobin in the urine, retinal damage, and convulsions.|$|E
5|$|The signs <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> {{paracetamol}} toxicity {{occur in}} three phases. The first phase begins {{within hours of}} overdose, and consists of nausea, vomiting, a pale appearance, and sweating. However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of metabolic acidosis and coma early {{in the course of}} poisoning.|$|E

5|$|Common signs <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> DVT include pain or tenderness, swelling, warmth, redness or discoloration, and distention {{of surface}} veins, {{although}} {{about half of}} those with the condition have no symptoms. Signs and symptoms alone are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to make a diagnosis, but when considered in conjunction with known risk factors, can help determine the likelihood of DVT. In most suspected cases, DVT is ruled out after evaluation, and symptoms are more often due to other causes, such as cellulitis, Baker's cyst, musculoskeletal injury, or lymphedema. Other differential diagnoses include hematoma, tumors, venous or arterial aneurysms, and connective tissue disorders.|$|E
5|$|Generally, if {{the patient}} is treated and survives then a full {{recovery}} is expected. Patients who present early to medical facilities and have prompt medical treatment typically will have a favorable outcome. Alternatively, patients presenting late with signs <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> coma, hyperkalemia, seizures, or severe acidosis have a poor prognosis. Patients who develop severe central nervous system manifestations or stroke who survive may have long term neurologic dysfunction; {{in some cases they}} may recover, although convalescence may be prolonged. The most significant long-term complication is related to the kidneys. Cases of permanent kidney damage, often requiring chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation, have been reported after severe poisoning.|$|E
5|$|It was {{considered}} {{more likely that}} Germany might employ such weapons against the United Kingdom, so four officers from the European Theater of Operations United States Army (ETOUSA) were summoned to Chicago where {{they were given a}} top secret briefing by the Manhattan District's Chicago area engineer, Major Arthur V. Peterson. They were told about possible forms such an attack might take, and what the effects <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> them were, and they were given survey instruments and shown how to use them. They were enjoined to tell other officers in the theater to report unexplained fogging of film or illnesses with symptoms corresponding to the effects of radiation sickness.|$|E

5|$|Most signs <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> AML {{are caused}} by the {{replacement}} of normal blood cells with leukemic cells. A lack of normal white blood cell production makes people more susceptible to infections; while the leukemic cells themselves are derived from white blood cell precursors, they have no infection-fighting capacity. A drop in {{red blood cell count}} (anemia) can cause fatigue, paleness, and shortness of breath. A lack of platelets can lead to easy bruising or bleeding with minor trauma.|$|E
5|$|Neuroacanthocytosis {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1950 as Bassen-Kornzweig disease, or Bassen-Kornzweig Syndrome, a rare, autosomal recessive, childhood-onset disorder {{in which the}} body fails to produce chylomicrons, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Symptoms include ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, retinitis pigmentosa {{and other forms of}} nerve dysfunction. It was first noted by the North American physician Frank Bassen, who later partnered with the ophthalmologist Abraham Kornzweig to identify and describe causes <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> the disease. Affected children appear normal at birth but usually fail to thrive during their first year.|$|E
5|$|Prominent signs <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> cholangiocarcinoma include {{abnormal}} {{liver function}} tests, abdominal pain, jaundice, and weight loss. Other {{symptoms such as}} generalized itching, fever, and changes in color of stool or urine may also occur. The disease is diagnosed {{through a combination of}} blood tests, imaging, endoscopy, and sometimes surgical exploration, with confirmation obtained after a pathologist examines cells from the tumor under a microscope. Known risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma include primary sclerosing cholangitis (an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts), infection with the parasitic liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini or Clonorchis sinensis, some congenital liver malformations, and exposure to Thorotrast (thorium dioxide), a chemical formerly used in medical imaging. However, most people with cholangiocarcinoma have no identifiable risk factors.|$|E

5|$|Signs <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> {{poisoning}} by A. ocreata are initially gastrointestinal {{in nature}} and include colicky abdominal pain, with watery diarrhea and vomiting which may lead to dehydration and, in severe cases, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and acid-base disturbances. The initial symptoms resolve {{two to three days}} after ingestion of the fungus. A more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement may then occur—jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma due to fulminant liver failure and attendant hepatic encephalopathy caused by the accumulation of normally liver-removed substances in the blood. Renal failure (either secondary to severe hepatitis or caused by direct toxic renal damage) and coagulopathy may appear during this stage. Life-threatening complications include increased intracranial pressure, intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and cardiac arrest. Death generally occurs six to sixteen days after the poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Signs <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> {{selenosis}} {{include a}} garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage. Extreme cases of selenosis can exhibit cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary edema, or death. Elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities {{because of low}} bioavailability. By contrast, selenates and selenites have an oxidant mode of action {{similar to that of}} arsenic trioxide and are very toxic. The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day. Hydrogen selenide is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas. Selenium also occurs in organic compounds, such as dimethyl selenide, selenomethionine, selenocysteine and methylselenocysteine, all of which have high bioavailability and are toxic in large doses.|$|E
5|$|Signs <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> {{the most}} common form of {{pancreatic}} cancer may include yellow skin, abdominal or back pain, unexplained weight loss, light-colored stools, dark urine and loss of appetite. There are usually no symptoms in the disease's early stages, and symptoms that are specific enough to suggest pancreatic cancer typically do not develop until the disease has reached an advanced stage. By the time of diagnosis, pancreatic cancer has often spread to other parts of the body.|$|E

5|$|Subclinical {{hypothyroidism}} is a milder form of hypothyroidism {{characterized by}} an elevated serum TSH level, but with a normal serum free thyroxine level. This milder form of hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In adults it is diagnosed when TSH levels are greater than 5 mIU/L and less than 10mIU/L. The presentation of subclinical hypothyroidism is variable and classic signs <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> hypothyroidism may not be observed. Of people with subclinical hypothyroidism, a proportion will develop overt hypothyroidism each year. In those with detectable antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO), this occurs in 4.3%, while in those with no detectable antibodies, this occurs in 2.6%. Those with subclinical hypothyroidism and detectable anti-TPO antibodies who do not require treatment should have repeat thyroid function tests more frequently (e.g. yearly) compared with {{those who do not}} have antibodies.|$|E
5|$|The {{clinical}} signs <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> AML {{result from the}} growth of leukemic clone cells, which tends to displace or interfere {{with the development of}} normal blood cells in the bone marrow. This leads to neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The symptoms of AML are, in turn, often due to the low numbers of these normal blood elements. In rare cases, people with AML can develop a chloroma, or solid tumor of leukemic cells outside the bone marrow, which can cause various symptoms depending on its location.|$|E
5|$|The signs <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> {{hypopituitarism}} vary, {{depending on}} which hormones are undersecreted and on the underlying cause of the abnormality. The diagnosis of hypopituitarism is made by blood tests, but often specific scans and other investigations are needed to find the underlying cause, such as tumors of the pituitary, and the ideal treatment. Most hormones controlled by the secretions of the pituitary can be replaced by tablets or injections. Hypopituitarism is a rare disease, but may be significantly underdiagnosed in people with previous traumatic brain injury. The first description of the condition was made in 1914 by the German physician Dr Morris Simmonds.|$|E
