It is manifested at least to the 100 th generations, which means that it is inherited epigenetically. Not only hormone synthesis but the receptorial hormone binding is also elevated, which means that the whole hormonal system is activated.

One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best documented responses to recent climate change is alterations in <b>the</b> migratory behavior <b>of</b> birds, but <b>the</b> mechanisms underlying these phenotypic adjustments are largely unknown. This knowledge is still crucial to predict whether populations of migratory birds will adapt to a rapid increase in temperature. We monitored migratory behavior in a population of blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) to test for evolutionary responses to recent climate change. Using a common garden experiment in time and captive breeding we demonstrated a genetic reduction in migratory activity and evolutionary change in phenotypic plasticity of migration onset. An artificial selection experiment further revealed that residency will rapidly evolve in completely migratory bird populations if selection for shorter migration distance persists. Our findings suggest that current <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> are favoring birds wintering closer to the breeding grounds and that populations of migratory birds have strongly responded to these changes in selection. <b>The</b> reduction <b>of</b> migratory activity is probably an important evolutionary process in <b>the</b> adaptation <b>of</b> migratory birds to climate change, because it reduces migration costs and facilitates the rapid adjustment to the shifts in <b>the</b> timing <b>of</b> food availability during reproduction. ...|$|R
