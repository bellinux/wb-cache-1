5|$|The {{goal is to}} {{increase}} the park's value and available money {{so that it can be}} sold and a new lot purchased from another part of the world to start a new theme park. Once enough money has been made, the player can auction the park <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> newer plots, located worldwide and having different factors affecting gameplay, including the economy, weather, terrain and land value. The Mega Drive and SNES versions feature different settings (e.g. desert and glacier) depending on the park's location.|$|E
5|$|With the Matabele wars over, Burnham {{decided it}} was time to leave Africa <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> other adventures. The family {{returned}} to California. Soon after, Fred traveled to Alaska and the Yukon to prospect in the Klondike Gold Rush, taking with him his eldest son Roderick, who was then 12 years old. On hearing of the Spanish–American War, Burnham rushed home to volunteer his services, but the war had ended before he could get to the fighting. Burnham returned to the Klondike having played no part in the war. Colonel Theodore Roosevelt regretted this as much as Burnham and paid him a great tribute in his book.|$|E

5|$|After the Kid {{returns and}} recovers, Rucks gives him another choice: He {{can have the}} Bastion rewind time to before the Calamity {{in the hopes of}} {{preventing}} it, or use it to evacuate the survivors <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> somewhere safe. Rucks is unsure if there is any way to prevent the Calamity from reoccurring if the time is rewound, as {{there was no way to}} test the process. The game ends either way, showing images of the characters (with the inclusion of Zulf if the player chose to rescue him) flying away or of their lives before the Calamity along with the credits. In the New Game+ mode, which is unlocked after beating the game once, it is hinted that restoring the world didn't prevent the Calamity.|$|E
5|$|The filming was {{supposed}} to begin in August 2009. However, due to the slow progress of Karthi's ongoing project, Aayirathil Oruvan, Paiyaa was postponed several times, since Karthi needed to maintain the continuity of his looks {{for his role in}} Aayirathil Oruvan. Its producer Ravindran complained at the Tamil Film Producers Council that Karthi was trying to change his look <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> Paiyaa before finishing his commitments, which forced Linguswamy to readjust the schedules. The shooting finally began in December 2008. The film's music was released in November 2009 along with the trailer. In late 2009, after finishing the filming of Paiyaa, Lingusamy disclosed his plans of remaking the film in Telugu and Hindi as well. Later, as Yuganikki Okkadu, the Telugu dubbed version of Karthi's Aayirathil Oruvan, emerged as successful in Andhra Pradesh, the team instead decided to dub and release the film in Telugu to cash in on Karthi's new-found popularity in the state. The Telugu version was titled Awara and its audio was released in March 2010; Awara was released simultaneously with the Tamil version. In March 2010, the film's distribution rights were acquired by Dhayanidhi Alagiri's Cloud Nine Movies.|$|E

25|$|The main {{chronology}} spans nine novels, {{which can}} be grouped into three sections: The Books of the North recount the Company's dealings with the Empire of Lady; the Books of the South follow the Company on its journey back to its beginnings in Khatovar; Glittering Stone sees the Company achieve victory over its employer's enemies, <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> its destiny.|$|E

However, the clans had already sided with Omar Samatar, so this was not as viable an option as it would appear.|$|E

25|$|Generally speaking, any {{research}} that combines psychological principles with legal applications or contexts {{could be considered}} legal psychology (although research involving clinical psychology, e.g., mental illness, competency, insanity defense, offender profiling, etc., is typically categorized as forensic psychology, and not legal psychology). For a time, legal psychology researchers were primarily focused on issues related to eyewitness testimony and jury decision-making; so much so, that the editor of Law and Human Behavior, the premier legal psychology journal, implored researchers to expand the scope of their research <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> other areas.|$|E

Finland came up with two wins to top the group <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the qualification round, along with Germany in second place and Denmark in third.

25|$|Part of his {{testimony}} concerned Muhammad's complete multiphase plan. His plan {{consisted of three}} phases in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metro areas. Phase One consisted of meticulously planning, mapping, and practicing their locations around the DC area. This way after each shooting {{they would be able}} to quickly leave the area on a predetermined path, <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the next location. Muhammad's goal in Phase One was to kill 6 white people a day for 30 days (180 per month). Malvo described how Phase One did not go as planned due to heavy traffic and the lack of a clear shot and/or getaway routes at different locations.|$|E
25|$|By 1870, the Democratic–Conservative {{leadership}} {{across the}} South decided {{it had to}} end its opposition to Reconstruction and black suffrage to survive <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> new issues. The Grant administration had proven by its crackdown on the Ku Klux Klan that it would use as much federal power as necessary to suppress open anti-black violence. Democrats in the North concurred with these Southern Democrats. They wanted to fight the Republican Party on economic grounds rather than race. The New Departure offered the chance for a clean slate without having to re-fight the Civil War every election. Furthermore, many wealthy Southern landowners thought they could control part of the newly enfranchised black electorate to their own advantage.|$|E

25|$|Typically, primary {{education}} {{is provided in}} schools, where the child will stay in steadily advancing classes until they complete it <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> secondary schooling. Children are usually placed in classes with one teacher who will be primarily responsible for their education and welfare for that year. This teacher may be assisted to varying degrees by specialist teachers in certain subject areas, often music or physical education. The continuity with a single teacher {{and the opportunity to}} build up a close relationship with the class is a notable feature of the {{primary education}} system. Pursuant to The Education Act, school attendance is compulsory for {{children between the ages of}} 7 and 16 years. In addition, schooling is provided to anyone between the ages of 6 to 21 years. Both primary and secondary education are free.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} points awarded on each hole is {{determined}} based on comparison {{of the number of}} strokes taken to a fixed score, usually par. This fixed score is then adjusted in relation to the player's handicap. Once players have taken two strokes more than the adjusted fixed score, they may abandon the hole <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the next, as it is then not possible to score any points on that hole. Because of this, it is still possible to be competitive even allowing for a few bad holes. At the end of the round, the {{number of points}} scored on each hole is totaled to give a final score. The winner of a Stableford competition is the player with the highest point total. Final scores may be modified for all players using the Competition Stableford Adjustment system.|$|E
25|$|The Colts won the J. Ross Robertson Cup in the 1999–2000 season, {{playing the}} seventh {{game on the}} road, {{defeating}} the Plymouth Whalers.

In the second game the Colts did not fare much better, losing to the Rimouski Océanic of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League 7–2. One day later Barrie defeated the Kootenay Ice of the Western Hockey League 3–2 in double overtime. This win allowed Barrie to finish ahead of Kootenay <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the semi-finals where they would again play the host team Halifax. Barrie stormed out of the gates defeating the host 6–3. Their final result in the tournament, however, was not the fairy-tale ending they anticipated: one day later the Colts played the Rimouski Océanic in the championship game, but were defeated with a final score of 6–2.|$|E
