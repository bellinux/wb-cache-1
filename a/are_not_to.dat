5|$|The National Flag of Portugal {{also serves}} as war flag and ensign, so being flown on {{military}} facilities and naval ships. There are however specific national military flags for specific uses, namely the military colors, the naval jack and the naval pennant. The military colors are occasionally referred as war flag, however they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be flown on military facilities but are only to be carried by the military units on parades.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Super Punch-Out!! {{is similar}} to that of its arcade and NES/FC predecessors. The player controls a nameable boxer as he fights his way to become W.V.B.A. Champion. The player controls the boxer from a third-person perspective, with him being translucent on the screen. Players can attack their opponents with jabs to the face or with body blows from either hand. The opponent can deflect punches, so players must aim at the opponent's open spot (where the gloves <b>are</b> <b>not)</b> <b>to</b> connect. Depending on the opponents' stances, they will guard themselves differently, so players need to use the correct punches.|$|E
5|$|According to Viktor Luneyev, the {{struggle}} against dissent operated on many more layers than those registered in court sentences. We {{do not know how}} many the secret services kept under surveillance, held criminally liable, arrested, sent to psychiatric hospitals, or who were sacked from their jobs, and restricted in all kinds of other ways in the exercise of their rights. No objective assessment {{of the total number of}} repressed persons is possible without fundamental analysis of archival documents. The difficulty is that the required data are very diverse and <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be found in a single archive. They are scattered between the State Archive of the Russian Federation, the archive of the Russian Federation State Statistical Committee (Goskomstat), the archives of the RF Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD of Russia), the FSB of Russia, the RF General Prosecutor's Office, and the Russian Military and Historical Archive. Further documents are held in the archives of 83 constituent entities of the Russian Federation, in urban and regional archives, as well as in the archives of the former Soviet Republics, now the 11 independent countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States or the three Baltic States (Baltics).|$|E

50|$|By {{the time}} of Chalcedon, {{it was agreed that}} monasteries <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> erected without the leave of the bishop; monks were to receive due honour, but <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> mix {{themselves}} up with the affairs of Church or State. They were to be subject to the bishop, etc. (can.iv). Clerics and monks <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> serve in war or embrace a secular life (can.vii).

5|$|All {{citizens}} of Canada, {{as well as}} corporate bodies, may petition the Crown for an award of arms. For an individual to obtain a grant of arms, a petition must {{be sent to the}} Chief Herald, providing a biography, references, and completed application forms. If the grant is approved, the individual then consults with heralds from the Authority to work out the design of their award. Upon completion of this process, the grant documents, in the form of letters patent, are created and provided to the grantee. The entire process is subject to certain fees required by the Government of Canada to cover costs of research and artwork; the fees <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> purchase the grant of arms. For corporations and institutions the process is similar.|$|E
5|$|In {{works from}} Jeux vénitiens, Lutosławski wrote long {{passages}} {{in which the}} parts of the ensemble <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be synchronised exactly. At cues from the conductor each instrumentalist may be instructed to move straight on to the next section, to finish their current section before moving on, or to stop. In this way the random elements within compositionally controlled limits defined by the term aleatory are carefully directed by the composer, who controls the architecture and harmonic progression of the piece precisely. Lutosławski notated the music exactly; there is no improvisation, no choice of parts is given to any instrumentalist, and there is thus no doubt about how the musical performance is to be realised.|$|E
5|$|Other than feral {{dogs and}} {{domestic}} cattle, {{the most frequently}} encountered non-human mammal is the hanuman, a long tailed grey langur prevalent in the Gangetic plain. Some wild boars and wolves may still be spotted in the small forests of Chinpai, Bandarsol and Charicha. Leopards and bears <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be seen any more in the wild. Sometimes during the season when mahua trees bloom, wild Asiatic elephants from Jharkhand come in trampling crops and threatening life and property. Birds of Birbhum include a mix of hilly and plain-land dwelling species like partridge, pigeon, green pigeon, water fowls, doyel, Indian robin, drongo, hawk, cuckoo, koel, sunbird, Indian roller, parrot, babbler, and some migratory birds.|$|E

60|$|Law {{is either}} archic[107] (of direction), meristic (of division), or critic (of judgment). Archic law {{is that of}} {{appointment}} and precept: it defines what <b>is</b> and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done. Meristic law is that of balance and distribution: it defines what <b>is</b> and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> possessed. Critic law is that of discernment and award: it defines what <b>is</b> and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> suffered.|$|R

5|$|Restoring the {{primitive}} scene {{is not done}} easily nor can it be done completely. Some species are extinct. Given time, an eastern hardwood forest can be regrown to maturity but the chestnut will be missing and so will the roar of pigeon wings. The colorful drapanid finches <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be heard again in the lowland forests of Hawaii, nor will the jack-hammer of the ivory-bill ring in southern swamps. The wolf and grizzly bear cannot readily be reintroduced into ranching communities, and the factor of human use of the parks is subject only to regulation, not elimination. Exotic plants, animals, and diseases are here to stay. All these limitations we fully realize. Yet, if the goal cannot be fully achieved it can be approached. A reasonable illusion of primitive America could be recreated, using the utmost in skill, judgment, and ecologic sensitivity. This in our opinion should be the objective of every national park and monument.|$|E
5|$|Some common {{structures}} {{are shown in}} figures 3 and 4, along with their lumped-element counterparts. These lumped-element approximations <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be taken as equivalent circuits {{but rather as a}} guide to the behaviour of the distributed elements over a certain frequency range. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show a short-circuit and open-circuit stub, respectively. When the stub length is λ/4, these behave, respectively, as anti-resonators and resonators and are therefore useful, respectively, as elements in band-pass and band-stop filters. Figure 3(c) shows a short-circuited line coupled to the main line. This also behaves as a resonator, but is commonly used in low-pass filter applications with the resonant frequency well outside the band of interest. Figures 3(d) and 3(e) show coupled line structures which are both useful in band-pass filters. The structures of figures 3(c) and 3(e) have equivalent circuits involving stubs placed in series with the line. Such a topology is straightforward to implement in open-wire circuits but not with a planar technology. These two {{structures are}} therefore useful for implementing an equivalent series element.|$|E
