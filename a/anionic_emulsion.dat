It covers {{a wide range}} of {{intersecting}} subjects, including biological sciences, dermatology, applied chemistry and physics. New raw materials for cosmetics and toiletries are continuously introduced into the competitive ingredients market. It is important that independent researchers perform strict, unbiased studies in order to assess their respective performance in the final products. This paper deals with a specific example of a relatively new class of emulsifying materials, the positively charged (cationic) emulsifiers. There are very few data regarding in-vivo skin performance of cationic emulsions against well-established non-ionic emulsifying systems, and no data regarding anionic/cationic comparison.

This thesis presents studies on hydroxypropyl guar (HPG) - borate, a Labile polyelectrolyte, interacting {{with a number}} of model tear film (eye) components including sulfate-stabilized polystyrene latex, <b>anionic</b> lipid-stabilized <b>emulsions</b> and cationic 1, 2 -dioleoyl- 3 -trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) liposomes. The presence of borate ions converts nonionic HPG into an anionic polyelectrolyte. However, the borate ions on HPG chains do not inhibit HPG-borate adsorption onto anionic polystyrene latex. Both HPG and HPG-borate show the same adsorption isotherms.

30|$|<b>Anionic</b> <b>emulsion</b> sizes {{consisting}} of rosin triglyceride esters and partly fortified rosin acids (i.e., rosin-ester sizes), {{have recently been}} used as internal sizes for alkaline papermaking. In this study, handsheets were prepared from pulp suspensions with alum and a rosin-ester size under various conditions, and sizing degree and size and aluminum contents of the handsheets were determined. Aluminum compounds originating from alum added to the pulp suspensions behave as retention aids of the rosin-ester size even in alkaline papermaking under limited conditions. Carboxyl groups in pulp are the primary retention sites of aluminum compounds in pulp suspensions. They form cationic sites on pulp fibers, and thus the anionic size emulsion particles are adsorbed on pulp fibers by electrostatic interactions. However, the cationic charges of aluminum compounds on pulp fibers decrease and finally disappear completely with the lapse of time after the alum addition by forming ionic bonds between the cationic sites and OH− ions. Thus, pH values of the pulp suspensions and timing of the size addition strongly influence the retention values of the rosin-ester size and the resultant sizing features.|$|E

At pH 3 – 5, anionic alginate adsorbed to the surfaces of β-Lg coated droplets due to electrostatic attraction. At pH 6 and 7 adsorption did not occur because of the strong electrostatic repulsion between the anionic alginate and <b>anionic</b> droplets. <b>Emulsion</b> droplets coated by β-Lg-alginate complexes were prone to bridging flocculation, which promoted creaming instability. However, high intensity ultrasound treatment was able to reduce the degree of droplet flocculation in these emulsions, thereby increasing their creaming stability. These results suggest that stable emulsions containing droplets surrounded by β-Lg–alginate interfacial complexes can be produced (at pH 4 and 5) by using ultrasound treatment to disrupt any flocs formed when the polysaccharide and emulsion are mixed together.

The mechanism of fat binding of chitosan is still not fully understood and {{has been the subject of}} controversy. This study was designed to improve the understanding of the underlying mechanism by investigating the interaction of chitosan with oil-in-water emulsion droplets. Our results indicated that (0. 1 % w/w) chitosan adsorbed to a 20 % w/w phosphatidylcholine-stabilized <b>anionic</b> primary <b>emulsion</b> to form a secondary cationic emulsion by electrostatic attraction forces under conditions resembling the stomach (pH 2). Bile salts (6 mM) were added to simulate secretion in the small intestine and pH increase. Bile salts adsorbed to the chitosan secondary emulsion, which resulted in aggregation of oil droplets followed by coalescence due to close packing of droplets. Increased viscosity (267 – 2531 cp) and increased degree of deacetylation (40 – 92 % DDA) of chitosan enhanced emulsion breakdown. Increasing the pH to 7. 5 without addition of bile salts yielded little aggregation. Pronounced aggregation is thought to decrease the accessibility of lipase to the oil resulting in lower bioavailability and reduced caloric intake. Understanding how chitosan interacts with oil droplets in the digestive tract is vital to developing a comprehensive model of the influence of chitosan on the bioavailability of dietary lipids. The information gained in this study may be useful for the interpretation and experimental design of animal and human feeding studies and for the rational design of chitosan-based functional foods for fat reduction...|$|R

40|$|Asphalt {{emulsions}} {{are one of}} {{the alternatives}} for stabilizing base layers. The use of asphalt emulsion treated mixtures can be cost effective especially in cold regions where supplying hot mix is not economical. However, in cold climates emulsion aggregate mixtures show low strength at early ages and require a longer curing time to develop breaking of asphalt emulsions throughout the aggregates. The breaking period depends on the rate of water loss from the mixture which is impacted by ambient temperatures. Type of asphalt emulsion, curing temperature, curing time and moisture content are four significant factors in early age development of engineering properties of the emulsion base aggregate mixture.

40|$|Emulsions form a {{major part}} of {{processed}} food formulations, either being the end products in themselves or as parts of a more complex food system. For the past few decades, colloid scientists have focussed mainly on the effects of processing conditions (e. g. heat, high pressure, and shear) on the physicochemical properties of emulsions (e. g. viscosity, droplet size distribution and phase stability). However, the information about the behaviour of food structures post consumption is very limited. Fundamental knowledge of how the food structures behave in the mouth is critical, as these oral interactions of food components influence the common sensorial perceptions (e. g. creaminess, smoothness) and the release of fat-soluble flavours. Initial studies also suggest that the breakdown of emulsions in the gastrointestinal tract and the generated interfacial structures impact lipid digestion, which can consequently influence post-prandial metabolic responses. This area of research needs to be intensively investigated before the knowledge can be applied to rational design of healthier food structures that could modulate the rate of lipid metabolism, bioavailability of nutrients, and also help in providing targeted delivery of flavour molecules and/or bioactive components. Hence, the objective of this research was to gain understanding of how emulsions behave during their passage through the gastrointestinal tract. In vitro digestion models that mimic the physicochemical processes and biological conditions in the mouth and gastrointestinal tract were successfully employed. Behaviour of model protein-stabilized emulsions (both positively charged (lactoferrin) as well as negatively charged [β-lactoglobulin (β-lg) ] oil-in-water emulsions) at each step of simulated physiological processing (using model oral, gastric and duodenal fluids individually) were investigated. In simulated mouth conditions, oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by lactoferrin or β-lg at the interfacial layers were mixed with artificial saliva at neutral pH that contained a range of mucin concentrations and salts. The β-lg emulsions did not interact with the artificial saliva due to the dominant repulsion between mutually opposite charges of anionic mucin and anionic β-lg interfacial layer at neutral pH. However, β-lg emulsions underwent some depletion flocculation on addition of higher concentrations of mucin due to the presence of unadsorbed mucin molecules in the continuous phase. In contrast, positively charged lactoferrin emulsions showed considerable salt-induced aggregation in the presence of salts (from the saliva) alone. Furthermore, lactoferrin emulsions underwent bridging flocculation because of electrostatic binding of anionic mucin to the positively charged lactoferrin-stabilized emulsion droplets. In acidic pH conditions (pH 1. 2) of the simulated gastric fluid (SGF), both protein-stabilized emulsions were positively charged. Addition of pepsin resulted in extensive droplet flocculation in both emulsions with a greater extent of droplet instability in lactoferrin emulsions. Coalescence of the droplets was observed as a result of peptic hydrolysis of the interfacial protein layers. Conditions such as ionic strength, pH and exposure to mucin were shown to significantly influence the rate of hydrolysis of β-lg-stabilized emulsion by pepsin. Addition of simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) containing physiological concentrations of bile salts to the emulsions showed competitive interfacial displacement of β-lg by bile salts. In the case of lactoferrin-stabilized emulsion droplets, there was considerable aggregation in the presence of intestinal electrolytes alone (without added bile salts) at pH 7. 5. Binding of anionic bile salts to cationic interfacial lactoferrin layer resulted in re-stabilization of salt-aggregated lactoferrin emulsions. On mixing with physiological concentrations of pancreatin (mixture of pancreatic lipase, amylase and protease), significant degree of coalescence and fatty acid release occurred for both the emulsions. This was attributed to the interfacial proteolysis by trypsin (proteolytic fractions of pancreatin) resulting in interfacial film rupturing. Exchange of initial interfacial materials by bile salts and trypsin-induced film breakage enhanced the potential for lipolytic fractions of pancreatin to act on the hydrophobic lipid core. The lipid digestion products (free fatty acids and mono and/or diglycerides) generated at the droplet surface further removed the residual intact protein layers from the interface by competitive displacement mechanisms. The sequential treatment of the cationic and <b>anionic</b> <b>emulsions</b> with artificial saliva, SGF and SIF, respectively, was determined to understand the impact of initial protein type during complete physiological processing from mouth to intestine. Broadly, both the protein-stabilized emulsions underwent charge reversals, extensive droplet flocculation, and significant coalescence as they passed through various stages of the in vitro digestion conditions. Except in the simulated mouth environment, the initial charge of the emulsifiers had relatively limited influence on droplet behaviour during the simulated digestion. The results contribute to the knowledge of how structure and charge of the emulsified lipid droplets impact digestion at various stages of physiology. This information might have important consequences for developing suitable microstructures that allow controlled breakdown of droplets in the mouth and predictable release of lipids in the gastrointestinal tract...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{aimed to}} assess the effect of {{exogenous}} lipid supplements on ocular comfort during contact lens wear and the biology underpinning those effects. A reliable device to measure the tear evaporation rate was developed and validated. Tear collection methods were optimised to characterise the tear lipidome. Electro spray tandem mass spectrometry was used to analyse individual lipid components. A pilot study demonstrated that the tear film stability during short-term contact lens wear was associated with ocular comfort, the activity of phospholipase A 2 enzyme (sPLA 2) and the concentrations of a lipid aldehyde, malondialdehyde (MDA). After 6 - 8 hours of lens wear, as the tear film stability increased so did the mole% of wax esters in the total lipidome whereas the mole% of cholesterol esters decreased. Higher tear evaporation rates were associated with reduced levels of phospholipids. The study also provided preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of an exogenous lipid supplement in improving ocular comfort and tear film stability during short-term contact lens wear. In the light of these preliminary findings, a double-masked, randomised crossover placebo controlled intervention study was conducted among habitual contact lens wearers to investigate {{various aspects of the}} lipid layer following the administration of two formulations of tear lipid supplements and their respective vehicle placebo. A transient improvement in tear film stability with the two lipid supplements was observed in symptomatic contact lens wearers. However, the improvement did not persist by the end of 2 -week long lens wear. Between the two supplements, the <b>anionic</b> phospholipid <b>emulsion</b> drop showed a superior effect in ocular comfort, lipid layer appearance and tear evaporation rate in symptomatic wearers compared to the zwitterionic phospholipid spray. Improved contact lens wear comfort was related to increased tear film stability and lipid layer thickness, and a reduced tear evaporation rate, sPLA 2 concentration and activity in tears. Increased concentration of sPLA 2 was also associated with higher concentrations of degraded phospholipids and reduced levels of (O-acyl) -ω-hydroxy fatty acids in tears. The study found significant associations between various aspects of the lipid layer and comfort of the eye. These associations suggests that alterations in lipid biochemistry might be modulating changes in clinical and functional aspects of lipid layer which triggers changes in lens wear comfort. The learnings may help to inform development of topical preparations to improve comfort. Thus, the thesis provided an evidence based assessment of the effect of topical lipid preparations on ocular comfort by a comprehensive exploration of the clinical, functional and biochemical aspects of tear lipid layer...|$|R
