25|$|Bernard Darwin was an {{authority}} on Charles Dickens. He frequently contributed the fourth leading article in The Times. The fourth Leader was devoted to flippant themes, and Darwin was known to insert quotes from or about Dickens in them. When Oxford Press issued all classics by Dickens around 1940, each with a foreword by a Dickensian scholar, Darwin was chosen to contribute the foreword to The Pickwick Papers. He was also asked by The Times to pen the main tribute to cricketer W.G. Grace when Grace's birth centenary was celebrated in 1948. The <b>article</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> included since in a few anthologies.|$|E

Nicholas Bollen, the E. Bronson Ingram Associate Professor in Finance, focuses his research on hedge funds; he discussed the subject “Do Hedge Fund Managers Misreport Returns?” at the Oxford Finance Symposium in 2008. The research of William G. Christie, Frances Hampton Currey Professor of Management, led to reform of NASDAQ trading practices.|$|E
25|$|However, the JRASC <b>article</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{criticized as}} lacking any error analysis. Since the {{triangulation}} base {{used by the}} astronomers in their calculations was very narrow, even very small errors in determination of directions {{could result in a}} very different triangulated trajectory. Measurement errors of slightly more than one-half degree would make possible a straight-line trajectory towards the Kecksburg area and a much shallower angle of descent than reported in the JRASC article. It was also pointed out that the photos used actually show the fireball trail becoming progressively thinner, suggesting motion away from the cameras, or in the direction of Pennsylvania. Had the trajectory been sideways to the cameras, as contended in the JRASC article, the trail would likely have remained roughly constant in thickness.|$|E
25|$|During {{a search}} among Mrs McGinty's possessions, Poirot finds a {{newspaper}} from which an <b>article</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> cut out. The newspaper is dated {{a few days}} before the murder. He later discovers that the missing article is about women connected with famous murder cases, and includes photographs of them. He also discovers that Mrs McGinty had purchased a bottle of ink in a local shop shortly before her murder. He concludes that she had recognised one of the women in the article, and had written to the paper in question. Someone must have found out about it and then killed her to prevent her from talking. Poirot and Spence, using the ages of people in the town, conclude that someone is either Lily Gamboll, who committed murder with a meat cleaver as a child, or Eva Kane, who had been the love interest who inspired a man to murder his wife and bury her in a cellar. Another possibility is that someone is Evelyn Hope, the daughter of Eva Kane. Shortly afterwards, Poirot discovers the murder weapon, a sugar hammer, left around in plain sight at his boarding house and accessible to all the suspects. In an attempt to flush out the murderer, Poirot claims to know more than he does and is nearly pushed under an oncoming train. Poirot decides to show most of the suspects the photos at a party. Mrs Upward claims to have seen the photo of Lily Gamboll, but does not say where.|$|E
