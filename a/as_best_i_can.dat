In order to help Doyle with this, Paolini recorded the pronunciation of every invented name and word in Brisingr from a list over nine pages long. It was tricky even for Paolini {{to do this because}} he cannot [...] "roll [...] r's" [...] properly. Doyle said he prepared for narrating Brisingr by going [...] "largely by physical description. If there are specific details about the voices, I latch onto those <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> But if a creature’s anatomical features are described, I try to imagine, for example, how the jaw might work...and then try and adapt that and attach it to something that sounds okay to the ear and is still slightly stranger than normal." ...|$|E

At present things look rather black for both of these; but personally I believe in them both: I believe that the Manx people will yet work out their economic solution, & that sometime sooner or later, they will awake to the beauty of their neglected language, & turn to it again with a rush of appreciation & true national feeling. Till then I am content to wait, & work <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> for Ellan Vannin." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{the modern}} style in which {{multiple}} sportscasters have an on-air conversation (usually with one functioning as play-by-play announcer and another as color commentator), Scully and his broadcast partners Jerry Doggett (1956–1987) and Ross Porter (1977–2004) called games solo with Scully working the entire game {{except for the}} 3rd and 7th innings. When Doggett retired after the 1987 season, he was replaced by Hall-of-Fame Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale, who previously broadcast games for the California Angels. Drysdale died {{in his hotel room}} following a heart attack before a game against the Montreal Expos in 1993, resulting in a very difficult broadcast for Scully and Porter, who were told of the death but could not mention it on-air until Drysdale's family had been notified and the official announcement of the death made. Scully announced the news of his death by saying, [...] "Never have I been asked to make an announcement that hurts me as much as this one. And I say it to you <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> with a broken heart." ...|$|E

50|$|I don’t {{have a set}} process, {{sometimes}} I get a {{beat and}} I work from that. Other times I’m driving my car and get an idea and start to work on something from there. The inspiration can come from anywhere. My writing is very honest, I just try to capture that moment <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can.</b>|$|R
40|$|Asia {{is a large}} continent, home {{to most of the}} world’s poor, and {{agriculture}} is the largest employer of the poor. The effects of agricultural trade liberalization in Asia are thus very important. Unfortunately, <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> tell, the literature on ex-post assessments of agricultural trade liberalization in Asia is somewhat thin. Much o...|$|R

5000|$|In a 1992 {{interview}} with Dr. Anthony Clare, Kitt spoke about her gay following, saying: [...] We're all rejected people, {{we know what}} it is to be refused, {{we know what it}} is to be oppressed, depressed, and then, accused, and I am very much cognizant of that feeling. Nothing in the world is more painful than rejection. I am a rejected, oppressed person, and so <b>I</b> understand them, <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> even though <b>I</b> am a heterosexual.|$|R

"I {{am going}} to meet the Arabs in the open battle, and fight them <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> If <b>I</b> crush them, my kingdom will then be put on a firm footing. But if I am killed honourably, the event will be {{recorded}} in the books of Arabia and India, and will be talked about by great men. It will be heard by other kings in the world, and it will be said that Raja Dahir of Sindh sacrificed his precious life {{for the sake of his}} country, in fighting with the enemy."

5000|$|... "Painting for me, can {{very much}} be like {{improvisation}} or devising in the theatre. One puts {{an idea of}} a kind down and one responds (truthfully) to it ... It's a constant conversation a visual dialogue with the subject matter always at the centre, until one arrives at the image which arguably has always been there since, I am always asking myself what is necessary ... Or responding honestly (<b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can)</b> to each part.

6000|$|Lord St. George walked {{about the}} room with the letter in his hand, meditating. [...] "The truth is," [...] he said, at last, [...] "we have made a mistake, and we must get out of it <b>as</b> <b>best</b> we <b>can.</b> <b>I</b> think my father is a little wrong about this clergyman's character." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is regrettable," [...] {{returned}} Robespierre, [...] "that {{you should}} have pledged your word in the matter. You will confess, Caron, {{that it was a}} little precipitate.

"If so, so let it be," [...] she replied, [...] "and I {{will bear}} all <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> I {{know nothing of}} these jewels, but if they still exist they are mine, not yours, and I am {{innocent}} of any witchcraft.

5000|$|Morissette {{has said}} that during the writing and {{recording}} of the album, she noticed a unifying theme emerging of [...] "the desire to mend unions and bridge gaps. Whether it be between genders or between human beings, between spirits." [...] She said that when she began working on the album, she was at [...] "the middle {{of the beginning of}} the end of a relationship", and that entering the studio and writing new material [...] "would propel me to face some of the truths that were scaring me. Inevitably, we ended up breaking up, so the record kind of followed the grieving of it, then the proverbial phoenix rising and continuing to grow." [...] Under Rug Swept was also influenced by the extensive travelling Morissette did between recording sessions, particularly her stay at a Navajo reservation: [...] "The sense of community the Navajo people really focus on, there's a similar sense of community I felt when I traveled, when we toured through the Middle East", she explained. [...] "It permeates what I yearn for and I try to create it <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> through the songs". She described the album as melodically and sonically [...] "more structured" [...] than her previous album, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie (1998).|$|R

"Quatermain," [...] he answered, [...] "I {{have come}} all the way from England, I will not say to kill, but to try to kill buffalo in the Lydenburg district, with you if possible, if not, without you, and thither I am going.

6000|$|As soon as Ned {{had left}} the room, sobbing {{in spite of his}} efforts to appear manly, the captain said: [...] "Now, gentlemen, since this must be done, I pray you to do it without loss of time.

6000|$|... "If I did {{not know}} you were prejudiced by a foolish and indiscreet woman, I should believe that {{you were trying to}} insult me as you have your adopted mother, and would save you the pain of doing both in HER house by leaving it now and forever.

6000|$|... "I don't know." [...] Mr. Carmyle frowned again. The {{subject of}} Ginger was plainly a sore one. [...] "And I don't want to know," [...] {{he went on}} heatedly, a dull flush rising in the cheeks which Sally was sure he had to shave twice a day. [...] "I don't care to know.

Since his arrest was a pure error, as I gather, you must repair that error <b>as</b> <b>best</b> you <b>can.</b> <b>I</b> am satisfied that you will do so, and need say no more. Your servant, sirs," [...] he added to intimate that he was now entirely at their disposal, and he stood waiting.|$|R
60|$|In answer I {{have to say}} that, {{having at}} the {{beginning}} of my official term expressed my intended policy as plainly as I was able, it is with deep regret and some mortification I now learn that there is great and injurious uncertainty in the public mind as to what that policy is, and what course I intend to pursue. Not having as yet seen occasion to change, it is now my purpose to pursue the course marked out in the inaugural address. I commend a careful consideration of the whole document <b>as</b> the <b>best</b> expression <b>I</b> <b>can</b> give of my purposes.|$|R
