It is a type of {{ownership}} right recognized by property law. This legal concept also supports the intent of a candidate not to abandon one's residence due to work or study.

50|$|Lodowick Post, a fox hunter, {{was chasing}} a fox through {{a vacant lot}} when Pierson came across the fox and, knowing it was being chased by another, killed the fox and took it away. Post sued Pierson on an action for {{trespass}} on the case for damages against his possession of the fox. Post argued that he had ownership of the fox as giving chase to an animal {{in the course of}} hunting it was sufficient to establish possession. The trial court found in favor of Post. On appeal after the trial, the issue put to the Supreme Court of Judicature of New York was whether one could obtain property rights to a wild <b>animal</b> (<b>Ferae</b> <b>naturae),</b> in this case the fox, by pursuit.|$|E
50|$|If the {{liability}} depended upon negligence, the negligence would consist in the owner's {{allowing it to}} be at large and not under control, although he knew, or ought to know, or {{must be taken to}} have known, that it was an <b>animal</b> <b>ferae</b> <b>naturae,</b> and that it might, therefore, at any time, indulge in its ferocious propensities. The test in determining whether or not a person was negligent in the keeping of a vicious animal was whether or not he acted as a reasonable man. The appellant was negligent in that he did not satisfy himself that the cage was in a satisfactory condition. The very fact that the baboon succeeded in escaping from the cage went to show that the cage was inadequate for the purpose it was intended to serve.|$|E
50|$|The {{commodity}} {{status of}} animals {{refers to the}} legal status as property of most non-human animals, particularly farmed animals, working animals and animals in sport, and their use as objects of trade. Free-roaming <b>animals</b> (<b>ferae</b> <b>naturae)</b> are (broadly) held in trust by the state; only if captured can be claimed as personal property.|$|R
50|$|It was {{therefore}} {{submitted by the}} State {{that it was not}} necessary to prove scienter of such viciousness before liability could be attached to a person having the ownership, custody or control over such an animal when it causes damage. Monkeys, the State noted, have been held to be <b>animals</b> <b>ferae</b> <b>naturae.</b> It was submitted that baboons also fell within this category.|$|R
50|$|Interest in {{personal}} property may be either absolute or qualified. The latter case {{is illustrated by}} <b>animals</b> <b>ferae</b> <b>naturae,</b> in which property is only coextensive with detention. Personal property may be acquired by occupancy (including the accessio, commixtio, and confusio of Roman law), by invention, as patent and copyright, or by transfer, either by the act of the law (as in bankruptcy, judgment and intestacy), or by the act of the party (as in gift, contract and will).|$|R
50|$|Res nullius (lit: nobody's thing) (also: Derelictio and Res derelictae is a Latin term {{derived from}} private Roman law whereby res (an {{object in the}} legal sense, {{anything}} that can be owned, even a slave, but not a subject in law such as a citizen nor land) is not yet the object of rights of any specific subject. Such items are considered ownerless property and are free to be acquired by means of occupatio. Examples of res nullius in the socio-economic sphere are wild <b>animals</b> (<b>ferae</b> <b>naturae)</b> or abandoned property (res derelictae). Finding can also be a means of occupation (i.e. vesting ownership), since a thing completely lost or abandoned is res nullius, and therefore belonged to the first taker. Specific legislation may be made, e.g. for beachcombing.|$|R
5000|$|Chose in {{possession}} {{is opposed to}} chose in action, and denotes not only the right to enjoy or possess a thing, but also the actual or constructive enjoyment of it. The possession may be absolute or qualified. It is absolute when the person is fully and completely the proprietor or owner of the thing; it is qualified when he [...] "has not an exclusive right, or not a permanent right, but a right that may sometimes subsist {{and at other times}} not subsist", {{as in the case of}} <b>animals</b> <b>ferae</b> <b>naturae</b> ("of a feral nature", or wild). A chose {{in possession}} is freely transferable by delivery. Previous to the Married Women's Property Act of 1882, a wife's choses in possession became vested in her husband immediately upon her marriage, while her choses in action did not belong to her husband until he had converted them to possession. However, this difference is now practically obsolete.|$|R

There is no {{strictly}} accurate {{definition of}} an estray {{to be found in}} any reported decision but from all of them may be deduced the following: An estray is an animal, by nature tame and reclaimable, having a value as property generally recognized by law, as a sheep, ox, hog, or horse, which is found wandering and the owner of which is unknown. Animals on which the law sets no value as a dog or cat and <b>animals</b> <b>ferae</b> <b>naturae</b> as a bear or wolf cannot be considered as estrays.2 Right to Forfeit. a. At Common Law The right to forfeit the title of the owner to estrays has been recognized from a very remote period. At the common law they were originally forfeited to the king as the general owner and lord paramount of the soil; and later they most commonly belonged to the lord of the manor by special grant from the crown.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recognised}} {{for some time}} that, in most situations, appropriate investment by private enterprise in sea ranching and stock enhancement requires that they have adequate property rights in the released animals (Hanson 1974). This presentation considers {{a number of different}} ways in which property rights or de facto property rights may achieve this fundamental objective. The English common law has, for the purpose of describing the rights of ownership of animals, divided animals into two classes, those the subject of absolute ownership (domitae naturae) and those the subject of a limited property right (<b>ferae</b> <b>naturae).</b> The principles underlying those concepts follow the Roman law concepts, as adopted in much of Europe. Domitae naturae consists of a number of populations of animals (e. g. cattle, sheep, pigs, horses, dogs, cats, etc.). As a class domitae naturae are generally tame and capable of living about humans. They are populations of animals useful to humans, identifiable as a population and are populations over which humans effect a level of subjugation or control. The law gives effect to this community recognition, stamping on the community the concept that an animal of that class belongs to somebody...|$|R

40|$|In Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., the United States Supreme Court {{seemingly}} {{laid to rest}} any lingering contentions of vested ownership theory {{relating to}} fisheries resources, stating that 2 ̆ 2 it is pure fantasy to talk of 2 ̆ 7 owning 2 ̆ 7 wild fish, birds, or animals. Neither the States nor the Federal Government, {{any more than a}} hopeful fisherman or hunter, has title to these creatures until they are reduced to capture. 2 ̆ 2 This doctrine, that common resources such as fish are of an inherently wild nature, or <b>ferae</b> <b>naturae,</b> such that actual possession is required in order to establish individual ownership, has survived as an unwavering fixture of the common law, and [...] has guided courts in their treatment of fishermen 2 ̆ 7 s rights and interests in the living resource that they harvest. In near defiance of this doctrine, some courts have {{gone so far as to}} suggest that fishermen hold a 2 ̆ 2 constructive property interest 2 ̆ 2 in fisheries, but in spite of such developments, the doctrine of <b>ferae</b> <b>naturae</b> has maintained its vitality and persists as theoretical support to another common law doc- trine, that of res communes, under which fisheries resources are owned in common, and which supports a common right to fish. However, traditional definitions of 2 ̆ 2 property 2 ̆ 2 recognize that the essence of property lies in the sum of fights and powers incident to ownership, with particular emphasis on rights of use. This Comment utilizes a 2 ̆ 2 sum of rights 2 ̆ 2 approach to discuss the modem proprietary relationship between fishermen and the fisheries that they depend upon. By analyzing this relationship from the perspective of specific legal contexts, this Comment argues that U. S. fishermen have acquired a sufficient quorum of property interests to recognize that they may hold some legitimate form of private property interest in fisheries resources, and that this interest may be recognized under the framework of the public trust doctrine in the furtherance of fisheries management and conservation efforts. This Comment begins its analysis in Part II, by outlining the common law doctrines that have historically limited the ability of fishermen to acquire proprietary interests in fisheries resources. Part III will then analyze the proprietary interests that are held by fishermen in fisheries resources, through the discussion of several specific legal contexts, including the ability of fishermen to recover for economic losses in tort. Next, Part IV discusses the extent to which the Fifth Amendment has provided constitutional protection for the proprietary interests of fishermen. Part V continues by outlining the various private interests that fishermen have acquired through rights based fishery management systems. Finally, Part VI discusses how proprietary interests in fisheries may be recognized under the public trust doctrine in the furtherance of fisheries management and conservation efforts. The recognition and future utilization of proprietary interests in U. S. fisheries management is a matter of particular importance in view of the Sustainable Fisheries Act, enacted in October of 1996, which amended the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act and which also mandated a moratorium on the implementation and approval of any fishery management plan that creates a new individual fishing quota program. This legislation also calls for a comprehensive study and report on the use of individual fishing quota programs, to be completed by October 1, 1998. As the federal government pauses to reconsider and evaluate the future use of such rights-based fishery management programs, it is important to realize, as this Comment argues, that the recognition of these proprietary rights is consistent with how the law has traditionally recognized such private interests in a variety of contexts. Moreover, the framework of the public trust doctrine, by providing for the concurrent existence of public and private interests in common resources, should to a large extent dispel the condemnation of rights-based fishery management programs as an unqualified give-away of public resources, and that this framework provides a foundation for recognizing more stable, long-term proprietary interests in fisheries that may enhance the overall effectiveness and conservation value of rights-based fishery management strategies in the future...|$|R
