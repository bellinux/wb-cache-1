50|$|Due to the {{clinical}} similarity between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, it was proposed {{that they may}} use the same cellular receptor; the exopeptidase, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (<b>ACE2).</b> However, it was later discovered that neutralization of <b>ACE2</b> by recombinant antibodies does not prevent MERS-CoV infection. Further research identified dipeptyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26) as a functional cellular receptor for MERS-CoV. Unlike other known coronavirus receptors, the enzymatic activity of DPP4 is not required for infection. As would be expected, the amino acid sequence of DPP4 is highly conserved across species and is expressed in the human bronchial epithelium and kidneys. Bat DPP4 genes {{appear to have been}} subject to a high degree of adaptive evolution as a response to coronavirus infections, so the lineage leading to MERS-CoV may have circulated in bat populations {{for a long period of}} time before being transmitted to people.|$|E
50|$|Proteins that {{contribute}} to the overall structure of all coronaviruses are the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). In the specific case of the SARS coronavirus (see below), a defined receptor-binding domain on S mediates the attachment of the virus to its cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (<b>ACE2).</b> Some coronaviruses (specifically the members of Betacoronavirus subgroup A) also have a shorter spike-like protein called hemagglutinin esterase (HE).|$|E
50|$|<b>A.C.E.2</b> is not {{a direct}} sequel to its predecessor, as it {{involves}} its own original plot, as well as covering events that already happened in A.C.E., albeit differently. This {{is not a}}n unusual occurrence, as Banpresto has done this with most entries in the Super Robot Wars franchise; most of the games in that series are not connected by an established continuity (exceptions include the Super Robot Wars Alpha games and the titles in the Super Robot Wars classic timeline), with remakes or updates abounding.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{data suggest}} an {{association}} of HCoV-NL63 infection with Kawasaki disease, a systemic vasculitis in childhood that may result in aneurysms of the coronary arteries. In the developed world, Kawasaki disease {{is the most common}} cause of acquired heart disease in children. Further analysis of HCoV-NL63 pathogenicity seems warranted, in particular because of recent evidence that this virus uses the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV (<b>ACE2).</b> HCoV-NL63 has also been found in the intestinal tract of infected individuals and linked to gastroenteritis. This type of infection is the direct result of the viral invasion of the mucosal lining of the intestines. The role of HCoV-NL63 in gastroenteritis is unclear due to typical co-infection with other viruses in this condition. HCoV-NL63 is likely under-detected due its role in many mild to moderate respiratory infections and comorbidity with other disease. Researchers have suggested that more comprehensive, population-based studies are necessary to determine the effects of this virus on systems outside of the respiratory tract.|$|E
5000|$|Transmission of HCoV-NL63 {{is likely}} through droplet {{expulsion}} from the respiratory tract, {{which may be}} airborne or spread through close personal contact. The virus is able to survive for up to seven days in respiratory secretions and remains infective at room temperature [...] Once the virus has entered the host it binds to cellular receptors using spike proteins, {{similar to those found}} in HIV-1. The virus is able to use Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (<b>ACE2)</b> as an entry receptor to bind to and enter target cells. No determination of the specific entry of the virus into the host cell has been completed. Therefore entrance into the cell is either through direct cell fusion with the plasma membrane or endocytosis followed by fusion with the membrane. Due to the lack of a cDNA clone of HCoV-NL63, research on the replication cycle is limited. Because it is a positive single-stranded RNA virus, the processes of replication via transcription and translation can be carried out in the cytoplasm of the infected cell.|$|E
40|$|Objective Previous {{analysis}} of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) gene in this laboratory showed that primary mesangial cells in culture are able to express ACE mRNA. Moreover, ACE is produced as an ectoenzyme and as a secreted form of the enzyme, indicating a potential effect of local angiotensin II production on glomerular microcirculation. {{the aim of this}} study was to purify and characterize the secreted end intracellular ACE forms from mesangial cells in culture. Methods and results Medium from Wister rats mesangial cells was collected (third passage), incubated for 20 h with RPMI without fetal bovine serum and concentrated 29 times in an Amicon concentrator. the concentrated medium was submitted to gel filtration on an AcA- 34 column and two peaks (ACE(1), mol. wt 130 000 and <b>ACE(2),</b> 60 000) with ACE on activity Hippuryl-His-Leu and Z-Phe-His-Leu were separated. the mesangial cells were collected and ACE enzyme was extracted using Triton X- 114, followed by centrifugation and concentration. the supernatant was submitted to the same chromatography as described above and two peaks with ACE activity (ACE(Int 1), mol. wt 130 000 and ACE(Int 2), 68 000) were separated. the purified ACE were inhibited by enalaprilat and captopril, two potent competitive inhibitors of ACE and by EDTA, using Hippuryl-His-Leu as a substrate. the K-m values were 2 mM for ACE(1) and <b>ACE(2)</b> and 3 mM for ACE(Int 1) end ACE(Int 2). the enzymes ACE(1) and <b>ACE(2)</b> presented an optimum pH of 8. 0 and ACE(Int 1) and ACE(Int 2) an optimum pH of 7. 5. Conclusion the activities of full-length wild-type and N-domain ACE were characterized by the ratio of the hydrolysis of Z-Phe-His-Leu/Hippuryl-His-Leu, which was 1 and 4, respectively. the ratios found for ACE(1), <b>ACE(2),</b> ACE(Int 1) and ACE(Int 2) in the present study were similar to those described above, suggesting that mesangial cells, besides showing the presence of intracellular ACE, are able to secret both full-length wild-type ACE and N-domain ACE. Thus, they may potentially have an effect, not only on bradykinin and angiotensin I (ACE wild-type), but also on substance P, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone and Met-enkephalin to interfere with glomerular haemodynamics and with the renal microcirculation.
