40|$|We {{consider}} {{two related}} but often-unlinked questions concerning <b>airport</b> <b>policy.</b> Should Canadian airports {{be subject to}} direct government regulation and how is this question informed by the role airports play in determining airline competition? We consider these questions {{in light of the}} recent history of devolution for Canadian airports under the National <b>Airport</b> <b>Policy,</b> and the current review of Canada’s Transportation Act by the Federal Government. We conclude that Canadian <b>airport</b> <b>policy</b> requires a series of substantial changes, the cumulative effects of which are required to address efficiency and airline competition issues. More generally we argue that the role of airports in fostering domestic airline competition strengthens the arguments against direct (pricecap) regulation. Keywords: JEL Classifications...|$|E

40|$|Advent of {{real-time}} information broadcasting technologies, {{growth in}} demand for air-cargo, and increased congestion and variability on air-road network, are the main forces compelling today 2 ̆ 7 s air-freight forwarders to improve their operational decision-making to be more competitive and responsive to needs of customers. This research studies the air-cargo transportation on both road (short-haul) and air (long haul) network {{from the perspective of}} a mid-size freight forwarder. We develop a routing algorithm for congestion avoidance on air-network based on historical data and introduce an innovative approach to incorporate real-time information to enable dynamic routing of cargo on a stochastic air-network. In the road network, we introduce a new class of pickup and delivery problems to carry out the customer load pickups, fleet management, cargo-to-flight assignments, and airport deliveries in a multiple airport region under alternative access <b>airport</b> <b>policy.</b> The main contributions of this research to the air-cargo literature are the study of the value of real-time information and introduction of the concept of dynamic air-cargo routing. In addition, this is the first study that provides an operational framework to implement the alternative access <b>airport</b> <b>policy.</b> This research also contributes to operations research and logistics literature by introducing a new class of pickup and deliveries with time-sensitive and pair-dependent cost structure. It also contributes an innovative algorithm based on successive subproblem solving for Lagrangian decomposed mixed integer programming that shows to be efficient in obtaining near optimal solutions in reasonable time. The performances of the algorithms presented in this research are tested through experimental and real-world case studies. The results demonstrate that dynamic routing with real-time information can dramatically improve delivery reliability and reduce expected cost on the air-network. Moreover, they confirm that alternative access <b>airport</b> <b>policy</b> can greatly enhance a forwarder 2 ̆ 7 s options and reduce the operational and service costs while improving the service levels...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{alternative}} policy options for tackling congestion and environmental {{problems in the}} German airport sector. The starting point of the discussion is the planned privatisation of several airports in Germany, which is normally justified on productive efficiency grounds. However, when designing an appropriate <b>airport</b> <b>policy,</b> allocative efficiency must also be regarded, which means the efficient usage of existing facilities and timely investment in new capacity. Airport charges must not only reflect operational costs of infrastructure supply but also {{take account of the}} social costs of airport usage. This paper shows the inefficiency of the current regulatory rules for solving congestion and environmental problems and proposes alternative solutions, taking into account the need for planning stability not only for the airlines but also for the airports, which is a prerequisite for lowering the transaction costs of the air transport and infrastructure system. ...|$|E

40|$|Internationally, {{governments have}} devolved {{responsibility}} for transport support industries {{from the public}} sector to the private sector. In Canada, this happened to airports under the Mulroney Conservative government {{through the creation of}} Local Airport Authorities (LAAs), and latterly through the implementation of the 1994 National <b>Airports</b> <b>Policy</b> (NAP) of the Chrétien Liberal government. Sufficient time has passed to consider the progress of this policy experiment.

The airport devolution process in Canada has been a success in many respects, but airport systems are complicated, capital intensive and long-lived. The success of airport commercialization in the longer term is yet to be determined. Many policy makers in other countries have been interested in the Canadian model of airport devolution. When Transport Canada began to contemplate devolution of the airports in the mid- 1980 s, its vision was not strictly privatization. Devolution policy embraced a combination of public ownership and private sector management of operations, termed as “commercialization. ...|$|R
40|$|ENG: As {{in other}} cities in the world, Buenos Aires airline {{operations}} take place {{in more than one}} airport. Indeed, the multi-airport system conformed by Aeroparque Jorge Newbery and Ezeiza International Airport agglomerates all the airline market supply of Buenos Aires. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze how both airports complement each other and how that model of complementation affects the airport- city relationship bases. For this purpose, various models of multi-airport operation were comparatively classified. On the other hand, the airport complementation model in Buenos Aires was analyzed in relation to other features of this activity to weight and prioritize the potential agenda of the metropolitan <b>airport</b> <b>policy</b> to encourage economic-productive positive impacts.

One of the primary policy concerns lies on the compatibility of alternative slot allocation strategies in different airport settings. The objective of this paper is threefold: (i) to develop and apply a methodological framework for the multi-criteria evaluation and selection of the most compatible slot allocation strategy with respect to policy criteria and priorities in various airport settings, (ii) to examine the applicability of policy compatibility results in various airport settings and their potential acceptability from different industry stakeholders, and (iii) to provide policy recommendations for European <b>airport</b> <b>policy</b> making and planning. ...|$|E

Methods: Tobacco industry document websites were searched for previously secret documents relating to efforts to maintain smoking in Lambert Airport. Testing of SHS contamination in non-smoking areas adjacent to a designated smoking room was conducted at Lambert Airport in 1997 – 98 and again in 2002. A 1998 comparative test was also performed inside nominally smoke-free Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac Airport). Tests were performed using either static or active nicotine monitors. Results: Industry documents show that the tobacco industry promoted the construction of designated smoking rooms {{as a way to}} sidetrack efforts to make Lambert Airport entirely non-smoking. Nicotine vapour air monitoring in a non-smoking area of the airport, adjacent to a smoking room located in Terminal C, reveals elevated levels of ambient nicotine vapour in excess of what would be expected in a completely non-smoking environment...|$|E

40|$|Using {{the case}} of Canada’s <b>airport</b> <b>policy,</b> this {{dissertation}} seeks {{to give an account}} of long-lasting conflicts between key actors of a policy sector who otherwise do not challenge the core policies and orientations of their sector and share the same core representations. The argument of this dissertation offers a response to the paradoxical outcome where a long-lasting policy has remained stable over time, despite engendering momentous conflicts and tensions between actors (to the point of threatening the stability of the policy sector) and being attacked by virtually all actors. This objective is sought by analyzing the Canadian airport sector and its four main platforms: Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary. The Canadian airport sector is highly puzzling, since long-lasting conflicts over the airport rent, the access to airport infrastructure and the funding and administration of airport screening have polluted the relations between the key stakeholders for years, while none of the key actors involved has challenged the main policy orientations and policy instruments used to regulate the sector. The study of the Canadian airport sector with a refocused and amended cognitive analysis of public policy framework developed by Muller and Jobert is really fruitful: it results in a comprehensive analysis of the conflicts, their nature, the possible ways to solve them, and it also considerably expands the explanatory power of the cognitive analysis of public policy...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the financing of}} U. S. public airports in a turbulent era of change, and projects toward the future. It begins by briefly outlining historical patterns that have changed the industry, and airport facilities in particular. It then develops basic principles of public finance as applied to public infrastructure, followed by the applicable principles of management. Following that, the current airport financing system is analyzed and contrasted with a socially optimal financing system. A concluding section suggests policy reforms and their likely benefits. The principles of finance and management discussed here are elementary. However, their implications are radical for U. S. <b>airport</b> <b>policy.</b> There {{is a great deal}} of room to improve the allocation of aviation infrastructure resources. The application of these basic principles makes it evident that in many cases, current practice is wasteful, environmentally unsound, overly costly, and inequitable. Future investments in public aviation capital will continue to be wasteful until more efficient pricing systems are instituted. Thus, problem in the U. S. is not one of insufficient investment in airport infrastructure, but investment in the wrong types of infrastructure. In the U. S., the vast majority of publically-owned airports are owned by local governments. Thus, while the federal government bad a great deal of influence in financing airports, ultimately these are local decisions. The same is true with many other public infrastructure issues. Katz and Herman (1997) report that in 1995, U. S. net public capital stock equaled almost $ 4. 6 trillion, 72 % of which ($ 3. 9 trillion) was owned by state and local governments, most of it in buildings, highways, Streets, sewer systems, and water supply facilities. Thus, public infrastructure finance is fundamentally a local government issue, with implications for federal and state governments in the design of their aid programs...|$|E
40|$|Noise {{pollution}} from aircraft, {{specifically in the}} vicinity of airports as aircraft takeoff and land, is a problem that has been shown to have negative impacts on the welfare of humans, animals, and the surrounding environment. The problem may only become worse as air travel increases for cargo and passenger operations, populations increase, and the overall number of aircraft increase. Currently, guidance has been issued from the International Civil Aviation Organization on how to combat the issue of noise pollution through policy, both at that national regulatory level, and at the local airport level. This study evaluated the local <b>airport</b> <b>policy</b> implementation schemes at 132 Class B and Class C airports in the United States. A latent class analysis was used to determine that six different airport clusters existed, each with a different set of noise pollution mitigation strategies ranging from the implementation of only noise mitigation strategies specifically approved by the FAA (e. g., noise abatement procedures), to airports that invest millions of dollars in the community for soundproofing homes and schools in addition to fines for aircraft violating specific noise threshold limits set in noise monitoring sensors around a community. In addition to the latent class analysis, this study found that several characteristics of the airport and the local surrounding community (within 10 miles) appeared to predict the potential policies that an airport might choose to implement. The region of the country in which an airport is located, and the population per square mile within ten miles of the center of the airport were significant predictors of the likelihood of an airport implementing a certain set of policies. Airports with larger population densities and located in the western portion of the United States, were more likely to belong to the cluster of airports that implemented a multitude of policy strategies than belong to the cluster of airports that sparsely implemented a few aircraft procedural policies. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} impact of Canada’s air {{transportation}} policy on air accessibility of remote and arctic communities {{in a context of}} liberalization of the aviation industry. The central objective is to examine policy’s impact on essential air service – travel and shipment. An observational study of the federal government’s National <b>Airports</b> <b>Policy</b> (NAP) of divesting smaller airports to local entities is conducted using airport cases {{both inside and outside the}} National Airports System (NAS) covering 12 communities in Ontario (Ont.), Manitoba (Man.), British Columbia (B. C.), Quebec (Que.), the Northwestern Territories (NWT), and Yukon Territory (YT). The paper also evaluates {{the impact of}} Airports Operations and Maintenance Subsidy Program (O&MSP) and investigates the impact of several federal government departments in assuring air accessibility to remote areas. It is argued that: (a) local management allows for greater entrepreneurship and leads to some efficiency gains, (b) remote and arctic airports seem to be unable to sustain and operate their infrastructures without receiving local or federal contributions, and (c) Health Canada, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC), and Inuit organizations, such as the Makivik Corporation through its subsidiaries carriers First Air and Air Inuit, play a significant role in making air travel accessible. It concludes that, although the decentralization strategy and the subsidy mechanisms are benefiting remote communities, Canada’s policy success is constrained by its failure to incorporate changing conditions, loss of focus, and flaws in performance evaluation.
