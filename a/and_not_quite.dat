[...] He believed that the principal aim of design was to achieve [...] "fitness for purpose", and repeatedly called for a style of architecture that avoided unnecessary architectural adornment.|$|E
500|$|The Poisoned Kiss (1927–29, premiered in 1936) {{is a light}} comedy. Vaughan Williams {{knew the}} Savoy operas well, and his music for this piece was and is widely {{regarded}} as in the Sullivan vein. The words, by an inexperienced librettist, were judged to fall far short of Gilbert's standards. Saylor sums up the critical consensus that the work is something between [...] "a frothy romantic comedy [...] a satirical fairy-tale", <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> successful in either category.|$|E
500|$|Following {{his rise}} to the throne, al-Mu'tadid {{continued}} his father's policies, and restored caliphal authority in the Jazira, northern Syria, and parts of western Iran. He established an effective administration, but the incessant campaigning, {{and the need to}} keep the soldiery satisfied, meant that it was almost totally geared towards providing the funds necessary to maintain the army. Nevertheless, al-Mu'tadid managed to accumulate a considerable surplus in his ten-year reign. At the same time the bureaucracy grew in power, it also saw a growth in factionalism, with two rival [...] "clans" [...] emerging, the Banu'l-Furat and the Banu'l-Jarrah. The two groups represented primarily different factions in a struggle for office and power, but there are indications of [...] "ideological" [...] differences as well: many of the Banu'l-Jarrah families hailed from converted Nestorian families and employed Christians in the bureaucracy, in addition to maintaining closer ties with the military, while the Banu'l-Furat tried to impose firm civilian control of the army <b>and</b> (<b>not</b> <b>quite</b> openly) favoured Shi'ism.|$|E

500|$|On a less {{positive}} note, Frank Jackson of Reynolds News quipped [...] "That TV pseudo-science shocker The Quatermass Xperiment {{has been}} filmed and quitermess they've {{made of it}} too", before slating the film as [...] "82 minutes of sick-making twaddle". The horror content of the film was mentioned in several reviews: Patrick Gibbs of the Daily Telegraph said the film [...] "gives the impression that it originated in the strip of some horror comic. It remains very horrid <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> coherent" [...] while the reviewer in the Daily Mirror found the film to be [...] "a real chiller thriller {{but not for the}} kids" [...] and Dilys Powell of The Sunday Times found the film [...] "exciting but distinctly nauseating". Another unimpressed critic was François Truffaut, who wrote in Cahiers du cinéma that [...] "This one is very, very bad, far from the small pleasure we get, for example, from the innocent science fiction films signed by the American Jack Arnold... The subject could have been turned into a good film, not lacking in spice; with a bit of imagination... None of this is in this sadly English film”.|$|E
500|$|James Berardinelli of ReelViews {{gave the}} film {{two and a}} half stars out of four, and claimed that many of the film's ideas for {{altering}} its familiar storyline [...] "sound better on paper than they turn out in execution." [...] Finding it tedious to view the film's story told multiple times, he wrote that the film [...] "slips into boredom." [...] Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle also gave the film {{two and a half}} stars, and although he praised its [...] "snappy dialogue and fresh characterizations", he considered the film's plot underdeveloped and characters lacking in motivation. Peter Rainer writing for The Christian Science Monitor gave the film a C+ and called it [...] "a moderately enjoyable escapade that isn't quite clever enough for adults <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> imaginative enough for children." [...] He was not overly critical of the film, but felt that it was a disappointment in comparison to the high standards for computer-animated films set by Pixar. Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News suggested that timelessness is a necessary component of an animated classic, and faulted the film for its attempt to be hip and current. While Ty Burr of The Boston Globe praised the film's vocal performances, he wrote, [...] "Hoodwinked never builds to a level of sustained comic mania... One aches to think what the great Looney Tunes directors could have done with this material." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics, {{with a few}} detractors. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book, Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, calling the script [...] "very stylish". The two noted that [...] " [...] Duchovny is very good here [...] and, as a counterbalance, [...] Anderson provides some great comic relief." [...] Shearman and Pearson concluded that the episode was [...] "a little too ponderously paced to be a classic episode, but it's clever and well crafted [...] a rewarding stand-out." [...] Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 4 out of 5 stars and wrote that [...] "Cawing birds, spirit portals and split personalities are {{the order of the}} day in a story that doesn't offer that much in genuine thrills, but the best moments are Scully's occasional complaints from the field." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. Despite noting that the episode [...] "gets off to an awkward start", Vitaris concluded that [...] "'Chimera' takes us into the heart of a quintessential X-Files family". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+", noting that, while the episode was good, it [...] "falls short of classic status, trying to make a metaphor into flesh, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> succeeding." [...] Although Handlen enjoyed the way the episode explores and then connects the main characters, his main critique was that Ellen's transformation is never explicitly explained. He explained that, [...] "If we had a sense of where her need comes from, if there was some hint at what drove her to this point, it would work; as is, the actress’s performance is excellent, but the character remains too generic." ...|$|E

2500|$|Michael Lopez-Alegria, the Spanish-born NASA {{astronaut}} {{who flew}} on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft {{on the return}} flight with Ansari, expressed his doubts to reporters before the flight: [...] "I'm {{not a big fan}} personally of having those guys go visit the space station because I think the space station is still a place that is under construction, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> operational. I don't think it's ideal." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, The Daily Telegraph {{gave the}} Xbox 360 version three-and-a-half stars {{out of five}} and called it [...] "a game that would have benefitted from being streamlined, with {{additional}} FPS levels replacing the awkward driving. It should have been an id game. Instead it occupies this weird halfway-house between Borderlands, MotorStorm and Doom, not quite an RPG, not quite a racer <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> an FPS." [...] The A.V. Club gave the same console version a C+ and said that its [...] "huge swaths... are lifted wholesale from Fallout 3, Borderlands, and BioShock, making Rage forever veer between loving homage and blatant plagiarism. In the end, Rage is an insecure, overly busy game that tries too hard to be too many things, and winds up with a greasy sheen of flop-sweat on its brow." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{interesting}} {{character of}} many Cyanea is {{their tendency to}} grow spines or thorns on the stem and leaves (see the photo of Cyanea platyphylla). [...] This is most pronounced in younger plants, and some species undergo a kind of metamorphosis as they mature, {{to the extent that}} different growth stages were described as separate species, {{due in part to the}} presence or absence of spines. [...] The purpose of the spines was puzzling, since in most island situations there is a tendency for plants to lose defenses - Hawaii is noted for its nettle-less nettles, mintless mints, <b>and</b> (<b>not</b> <b>quite)</b> thornless raspberries - and no native browsing animals were known. [...] However, it is now believed that the spines were a defense against the moa-nalo, giant browsing geese and goose-like ducks that formerly inhabited the islands (Givnish et al. 1995). [...] These birds were apparently driven extinct by the Hawaiians before Europeans reached the islands, but their evolutionary effects live on.|$|E
