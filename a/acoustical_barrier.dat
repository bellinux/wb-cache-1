Phase 2 renovations, completed in the 2002 season, featured the construction of a 150 ft proscenium stage house which included improvements such as: a fully functional fly system, larger stage platform, a completely protected stage, and a stage house that provides an <b>acoustical</b> <b>barrier</b> from other area events. The crowning achievement of the Bengt Sjostrom Theatre renovation was completed in June 2003—a motorized retractable roof.|$|E
40|$|Addendum {{experiment}} supplementing Daniel Zielinski's M. S. thesis work. Common carp are {{arguably the}} most invasive and damaging fish worldwide. Increasingly, invasive fish species are targeted for population control by limiting their dispersal. Because of the species’ dependence on migration through streams and rivers for reproduction, the fish might be targeted using barriers that impede migration. Fish barriers usually consist {{of some sort of}} device laid across a stream or river channel that emits an aversive stimulus (electrical, acoustic, physical, etc.). Ongoing research at the Sorensen Lab is looking into the development of bubble-based <b>acoustical</b> <b>barriers</b> to limit the migration of carps. These <b>acoustical</b> <b>barriers</b> are designed {{to take advantage of the}} fact that cyprinid fishes (the family that includes invasive carps) possess a very acute auditory sense which is analogous to human hearing. In this way, aversive acoustical stimuli released by barriers should be especially effective at controlling movement of cyprinids. This study serves to quantify and qualify the behaviour of common carp in daylight and darkness through video capture of crossing events occurring near an <b>acoustical</b> bubble <b>barrier.</b> The role of vision in the fish’s response is examined in this way. The existing barrier apparatus was designed and used by Dan Zielinski in his thesis research. In general it is concluded that the fish displayed significant avoidance behaviour but also will occasionally enter and/or cross the barrier (as suggested by previous work). At the same time, the video proves that conditioning to the aversion can happen quickly. The fish schooled the majority of the time during trials, and most crossings were done in a parallel orientation to water flow. The distance from barrier and other associated behaviours are highly variable between groups and over time, suggesting a heavy role of fish personality (shy-bold axis) and learning in the efficacy of the barrier. This research was supported by the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{strategic}} noise mapping research conducted in Dublin, Ireland. Noise maps are constructed for the day–evening–night-time and night-time periods {{and levels of}} population exposure are estimated for the same periods. In methodological terms, the research uses the UK’s calculation of road traffic noise (CRTN) method for calculating noise levels in the study area. This method has been adopted as the interim calculation method by the Irish authorities responsible for meeting the obligations {{set out in the}} EU Environmental Noise Directive (END). The research also investigates the usefulness of three noise mitigation measures for ‘acoustical planning’ purposes: traffic reductions, speed reductions and erection of <b>acoustical</b> <b>barriers.</b> The results indicate that levels of population exposure during night-time are extremely high relative to guideline limits set down by the World Health Organisation. In addition, the results highlight the significant role that certain noise mitigation measures can play in good ‘acoustical planning’...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} work is to demonstrate how an innovative mixedweight solution can lead to achieve more sustainable housing constructions, having in mind that functional aspects related with comfort- thermal, acoustical and natural illumination should be safeguarded. The integrated accomplishment of all these aspects is difficult and not easily predictable. That’s why, for this comparative study, two Test Cells were built and monitored. The proposed mixedweight strategy was evaluated on a Test Cell made with a heavyweight central area, theoretically conceived to lodge the resting areas of a house- bedrooms, bathroom and living room. North and South envelope façades, pavement and covering are lightweight and lodge the less protected areas, destined for working (office, dining room and kitchen) and a corridor / sunspace, respectively. These compartments also take the role of thermal and <b>acoustical</b> <b>barriers</b> to the resting zone. This mixedweight strategy allowed to significantly less environmental cost in comparison to a conventional heavyweight constructive solution using hollow brick and steel reinforced concrete evaluated on a Reference Test Cell and conceived in a monozone layout.

40|$|Low noise {{surfaces}} {{have been}} increasingly {{considered as a}} viable and cost-effective alternative to <b>acoustical</b> <b>barriers.</b> However, road planners and administrators frequently lack information on {{the correlation between the}} type of road surface and the resulting noise emission profile. To address this problem, a method to identify and classify different types of road pavements was developed, whereby near field road noise is analyzed using statistical learning methods. The vehicle rolling sound signal near the tires and close to the road surface was acquired by two microphones in a special arrangement which implements the Close-Proximity method. A set of features, characterizing the properties of the road pavement, was extracted from the corresponding sound profiles. A feature selection method was used to automatically select those that are most relevant in predicting the type of pavement, while reducing the computational cost. A set of different types of road pavement segments were tested and the performance of the classifier was evaluated. Results of pavement classification performed during a road journey are presented on a map, together with geographical data. This procedure leads to a considerable improvement in the quality of road pavement noise data, thereby increasing the accuracy of road traffic noise prediction models...|$|R

40|$|In {{support of}} the area-oriented {{national}} and provincial policy in rural areas, as presented {{in the framework of}} the Administrative agreement on Area-oriented rural development, RIVM and Alterra, the main centre of expertise on rural areas in the Netherlands, cooperated in an investigation focusing on the acoustic quality of several types of function-related rural area. Areas investigated were: - The Ecological Main Network (EMN) -Quiet zones-Rural living areas-Environmentally friendly recreation -Extensive recreation This investigation was a follow-up to the 'Quick-Scan' study carried out by Alterra to test the deterioration of the acoustical quality of these areas, determining noise hindrance (in LA eq., over 24 hours) from national noise maps for road (national and regional), rail and air traffic. Noise hindrance for the above-mentioned types was tested against the standard chosen for the area's function {{on the basis of this}} function. This method was used both in the current situation, making use of noise maps from the Environmental Balance of 2001 and the future scenario from the RIVM's Fifth Environmental Report for 2030. During the investigation an estimate was made of the costs necessary for adopting measures for national and provincial roads so that the standards could be met according to objectives D 1 (for noise levels under 37 dB(A) and D 2 (application of low-noise asphalt. The investigation has shown that in order to strictly meet the standards in the above-mentioned areas along large sections of national and provincial roads, <b>acoustical</b> <b>barriers</b> and walls will be necessary. This can lead to extra-proportional costs and practical objections. The alternative, in which a choice is made for the quietest form of road cover in the road cover replacement scheme for national and provincial roads, is considered as the most desirable solution, both from practical and visual points of view, and from the standpoint of costs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: With rapid urbanization, {{the volume}} of traffic in urban area has been {{significantly}} increased. This in turn led to problem which {{can be described as}} Road Traffic Noise. Currently, to alleviate the road traffic noise damage, a demand for installation of soundproofing walls is rising. Among different shapes of soundproof walls being installed, the reflection-type acoustical insulation panel is highly drawing attentions of residents {{due to the fact that}} it does not obstruct their field of vision in contrast with the opaque acoustical insulation panel. On the other hand, improving the soundproofing wall of the reflection-type <b>acoustical</b> insulation <b>barrier</b> panel needs to be focused on since it has a possibility to cause a secondary damage by reflected sounds. Therefore, in this research, study has been carried out to improve the forms in order to minimize travelling of reflected sounds through changing the frontal surface shape and geometrical shape of the reflection-type soundproofing panel. A result from comparison between the normal reflection-type soundproofing panel and the improved soundproofing panel, with reduction effects in the noise reflection, showed that the curved type of soundproofing panel has an impact on reducing the noise up to 1. 5 dB. Furthermore, from the research conducted, it appears that the increase and decrease in the reflected sounds can be changeable depending on various design factors. Thus, it turns out that the study shows a potential possibility to develop a reduction technology of the reflected sound...|$|R
