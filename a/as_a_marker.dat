40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{validate}} hydroxyphenyl propane (LIPE®) <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>marker</b> of fecal output in sheep, goats, chickens, ostriches, dairy cattle, equine, buffalo, and cattle species. Feces were carefully collected from the ground to avoid contamination put into polietilene bags and further weighed. LIPE® concentration in feces was determined using infrared spectroscopy. It was therefore necessary to create a standard curve; the concentration of LIPE® in an unknown sample is calculated by interpolation on the graph of the standard curve. The values for fecal output obtained using LIPE® <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>marker</b> were similar to those obtained by total feces collection. These studies thus validate LIPE® <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>marker</b> of fecal output. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>marker,</b> LIPE® is comparable to total feces collection in these species with a recovery rate ranging from 95. 8 to 106. 3 %. LIPE® can therefore be used to estimate fecal outpu...|$|R

5|$|The {{usage of}} ain't is a {{continuing}} subject of controversy in English. Ain't is commonly used by many speakers in oral and informal settings, especially in certain regions and dialects. Its usage is often highly stigmatized, {{and it can be}} used by the general public <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>marker</b> of low socio-economic or regional status or education level.

5|$|Carpentier’s {{historical}} {{account is}} greatly simplified {{in order to}} increase the contrast between the white land owners and their black slaves. The marvellous, one of the most notable features of the novel, is used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>marker</b> of contrast between the two groups: firstly, because mention of the magical always takes the form of the slaves' point of view, while the more real interpretation of each event is from the whites' perspective; secondly, because the marvellous is used as a weapon to fight injustice. Instances of cruelty and violence between the groups are recounted grotesquely in great detail, which enhances the rivalry. More importantly, by allowing readers to see through the slaves' point of view, Carpentier brings to light the power and durability of the Haitian community and destabilizes the narrative of Western supremacy.|$|E
5|$|Vascular land plants make lignin, a polymer used to {{strengthen}} the secondary cell walls of xylem tracheids and vessels {{to keep them from}} collapsing when a plant sucks water through them under water stress. Lignin is also used in other cell types like sclerenchyma fibres that provide structural support for a plant and is a major constituent of wood. Sporopollenin is a chemically resistant polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen of land plants responsible for the survival of early land plant spores and the pollen of seed plants in the fossil record. It is widely regarded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>marker</b> for the start of land plant evolution during the Ordovician period.|$|E

His {{sale of the}} casts were not successful, and at a low financial and personal ebb he asked that {{for one of the}} reproductions to act <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>marker</b> for his grave. A cast was not placed there until 1973. There are only three other surviving comments of his on the figure: on an 1895 presentation mount of two impressions of a woodcut of the Oviri figure he made to Stéphane Mallarmé where he called the figure a strange and cruel enigma; in an 1897 letter to Ambroise Vollard where he referred to it as La Tueuse ("The Murderess"); and in a c. 1899 drawing where he appends an inscription referencing Honoré de Balzac's novel Séraphîta. Oviri was exhibited at the 1906 Salon d'Automne (no.57) where it influenced Pablo Picasso, who based one of the figures in Les Demoiselles d'Avignon on it.|$|E
5|$|In 561, {{the king}} {{now known as}} Sky Witness {{installed}} a ruler {{at the site of}} Los Alacranes. Sky Witness played a major part in the political events of the Maya region. He became the overlord of the city of Caracol, to the south of Naranjo, which had previously been a vassal of Tikal. In 562, according to a damaged text at Caracol, Sky Witness defeated Tikal itself and sacrificed its king Wak Chan K'awiil, thus ending his branch of the royal dynasty at Tikal. This catastrophic defeat began a 130-year hiatus for Tikal, reflecting an extended period of dominance by Calakmul. This event is used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>marker</b> to divide the Early Classic from the Late Classic. Sky Witness is also mentioned at Okop, a site much further north in Quintana Roo. The last reference to Sky Witness occurs at Caracol and is dated to AD 572. The text is damaged but probably records the death of this powerful king.|$|E
