5|$|By 1990, Moffat {{had written}} two series of Press Gang, but the programme's high cost along with {{organisational}} changes at Central cast its future in doubt. As Moffat wondered {{what to do}} next <b>and</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> his future employment, Bob Spiers, Press Gangs primary director, suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Moffat's father had been a headteacher and Moffat himself had taught English before writing Press Gang, so his initial proposal was a programme similar to what would become Chalk, a series that eventually aired in 1997.|$|E

5|$|Though Ziegfeld {{anticipated}} {{opening his}} new theatre on Sixth Avenue with Show Boat, the epic {{nature of the}} work required an unusually long gestation period and extensive changes during out-of-town tryouts. Impatient with Kern and Hammerstein <b>and</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the serious tone of the musical (he strongly disliked the songs Ol' Man River and Mis'ry's Comin' Around), Ziegfeld decided to open his theatre in February 1927 with Rio Rita, a musical by Kern's collaborator Guy Bolton. When Rio Rita proved to be a success, Show Boats Broadway opening was delayed until Rita could be moved to another theatre.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Shoulder Arms, Chaplin {{requested}} more money from First National, which was refused. Frustrated with their lack of concern for quality, <b>and</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> rumours of a possible merger between the company and Famous Players-Lasky, Chaplin joined forces with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and D. W. Griffith {{to form a new}} distribution company – United Artists, established in January 1919. The arrangement was revolutionary in the film industry, as it enabled the four partners – all creative artists – to personally fund their pictures and have complete control. Chaplin was eager to start with the new company and offered to buy out his contract with First National. They declined this and insisted that he complete the final six films he owed them.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{guidance}} of writer-editor Stan Lee and artists/co-plotters such as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, Marvel began its own rise to prominence. With an innovation that changed the comic-book industry, The Fantastic Four #1 initiated a naturalistic style of superheroes with human failings, fears, and inner demons, who squabbled <b>and</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the likes of rent-money. In contrast to the straitlaced archetypes of superheroes at the time, this ushered in a revolution. With dynamic artwork by Kirby, Steve Ditko, Don Heck, and others complementing Lee's colorful, catchy prose, the new style became popular among college students who could identify with the angst and the irreverent nature of the characters such as Spider-Man, the X-Men and the Hulk during a time period of social upheaval {{and the rise of}} a youth counterculture.|$|E

Proponents of the domestic acquisitions argue they fill the same role as the standard police Lenco BearCat armored vehicles. Proponents, such as Sgt.

25|$|In New York, an anti-slavery Democratic faction {{known as}} the Barnburners {{strongly}} supported the Wilmot Proviso and rejected Cass. Joined by other anti-slavery Democrat from other states, the Barnburners held a convention nominating former President Martin Van Buren as their own presidential nominee. Though Van Buren had not been known for his anti-slavery views while president, he embraced them in 1848. Polk was surprised and disappointed by his former ally's political conversion, <b>and</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the divisiveness of a sectional party organized around abolitionism. Van Buren was joined on the Free Soil Party's ticket by Charles Francis Adams Sr., son of former President and prominent Whig John Quincy Adams.

25|$|Meanwhile, William Beresford's Allied army {{defeated}} Soult at the Battle of Albuera on 16 May 1811. Casualties in {{the engagement}} were appalling. French losses are estimated at 7,000 men killed, wounded, and captured. British casualties numbered 4,156, Spanish losses were 1,359, and 389 Portuguese fell, {{for a total}} of 5,904 Allied casualties. Despite the victory, the Second Siege of Badajoz ended with the Allies raising the siege on 10 June and falling back to Elvas in Portugal. This was because Marshal Auguste Marmont appeared on the scene with a second French army. Meanwhile, Joaquín Blake y Joyes took 10,000 Spanish troops and marched south. Hearing reports of Freire's activity <b>and</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> Blake's column, Soult marched away on 24 June, leaving Marmont to face the Allies. First he headed to Niebla where Blake was besieging a French garrison. The Spanish general marched rapidly south and his troops were taken on board a British squadron at Ayamonte on 8 July.|$|E

Adams was cast in the supporting part of a promiscuous cheerleader.

Hawke promised to see Peel that evening and took the twelfth man onto the field. According to Thompson, when Hirst went onto the field, he saw [...] "with dawning dismay that there were not eleven fieldsmen present but twelve. There, his face red, his cap awry, the ball in his hand, stood Peel". Peel was even more drunk than at breakfast, and Hawke ordered him from the field. Peel replied that he was fine, and according to Hirst bowled a ball to demonstrate his fitness, but in his confusion did so in the wrong direction. Peel was then led from the field. After falling asleep in the hotel, he was advised by Hirst to apologise to Lord Hawke, but refused, claiming that he was indispensable to the team and would be recalled.|$|E
