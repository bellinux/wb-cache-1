40|$|Abstract Introduction The {{most common}} cause of parotid fistula is trauma, {{followed}} by malignancy, operative complications (parotidectomy or rhytidectomy) and infection. <b>Acute</b> <b>suppurative</b> <b>parotitis</b> can rarely produce parotid fistula. There are various treatment options available, however it is necessary to standardize the treatment according to the duration of history and the patient's general condition. Case report A 13 -year-old Indo-Caucasian girl presented to us with a two-year history of clear watery discharge from a wound just above and behind the angle of her right jaw. A diagnosis of salivary (parotid) fistula was made based on clinical examination and investigations. The parotid fistula was successfully managed. Conclusion Parotid fistula secondary to suppurative parotitis is rare and difficult to manage successfully. Meticulous dissection, complete excision of the fistulous tract with closure of the parotid fascia and layered closure of the incision followed by application of a post-operative pressure bandage, anticholinergic agents and antibiotics contribute significantly to the successful management of this difficult clinical condition. </p...|$|E

40|$|Postsurgical <b>acute</b> <b>suppurative</b> <b>parotitis</b> is a {{bacterial}} gland infection that occurs {{from a few}} days up to some weeks after abdominal surgical procedures. In this study, the authors analyze the prevalence of this complication in Hospital das Clínicas/São Paulo University Medical School by prospectively reviewing the charts of patients who underwent surgeries performed by the gastroenterological and general surgery staff from 1980 to 2005. Diagnosis of parotitis or sialoadenitis was analyzed. Sialolithiasis and chronic parotitis previous to hospitalization were exclusion criteria. In a total of 100, 679 surgeries, 256 patients were diagnosed with parotitis or sialoadenitis. Nevertheless, only three cases of acute postsurgical suppurative parotitis associated with the surgery were identified giving an incidence of 0. 0028 %. All patients presented with risk factors such as malnutrition, immunosuppression, prolonged immobilization and dehydration. In the past, acute postsurgical suppurative parotitis was a relatively common complication after major abdominal surgeries. Its incidence decreased {{as a consequence of}} the improvement of perioperative antibiotic therapy and postoperative support.

Advisers : (1) Nanang Mardiraharjo* (2) Ruby Riana Asparini ** Background: The cause of <b>acute</b> <b>suppurative</b> otitis media (ASOM) is {{upper respiratory tract}} infection (URI), in which tonsillitis is one most frequently found URI.

Method: Analytic observational with cross sectional approach with total sampling data collection. The sample was 113 medical record files, consisted of 71 acute tonsillitis patients and 42 chronic tonsillitis patients.

Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective five years study of 72 patients with suppurative otitis media in patient 16 aged years and above, who presented to ENT clinic in a tertiary institution, North western Nigeria from January 2006 - December 20011. Results: A total number of 112 patients were diagnosed with suppurative otitis media, out of which 72 case files were accessible for review. The age range was 16 - 65 years with the mean of 31. 2 (SD - 13. 1). Most proportion (41. 7 %) of patients were between the age of 16 - 25 years Fifty five (76. 4 %) patients had chronic suppurative otitis media, of which 13 (18. 1 %) were bilateral, 30 (417 %) had pre-existing childhood recurrent otorrhoea while <b>acute</b> <b>suppurative</b> otitis media accounted for 23. 6 %.
