5|$|Alpha Flight's Northstar was {{the first}} major gay {{character}} in the Marvel universe and remains the most famous gay character in mainstream comics. Created by Marvel Comics in 1979 {{as a member of the}} original Alpha Flight superhero team, Northstar's sexual identity was hinted at early in his history, in 1983 in issues 7 and 8 of Alpha Flight, but not openly stated; his <b>apparent</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> interest in women was chalked up to his obsessive drive to win as a ski champion. The character was finally revealed to be gay in 1992's Alpha Flight issue 106 and his outing made national headlines.|$|E

5|$|NHL {{broadcaster}} Darren Eliot {{attributes the}} <b>apparent</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> playoff success {{to the different}} style of competition compared to the regular season: instead of playing different teams every night, {{the goal is to}} advance through four best-of-seven playoff series. The Presidents' Trophy winner may have to go through other playoff clubs who might have a hotter goaltender, a better defensive team or other players that pose match-up problems. If the regular-season champion's primary success was merely outscoring others, they may be out of luck facing goaltenders that can shut them out. The lack of playoff experience may have been to blame in the examples of the 1999–2000 St. Louis Blues and 2008–09 San Jose Sharks, as neither team had advanced past the second round for five or more seasons. Teams have often given up pursuit of finishing first in the League in order to avoid injuries and rest key players for the postseason.|$|E
5|$|No.33 Squadron, {{operating}} ex-Qantas Short Empire flying {{boats and}} several smaller transports, {{was raised in}} NEA on 19February 1942. Earlier that month, Lukis warned higher command of the poor state of preparedness and low morale of Australian Army troops at Port Moresby, {{due to lack of}} air cover and <b>apparent</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> interest from government echelons. On 25February, Nos.3 and 4Fighter Sector Headquarters were established to coordinate fighter operations; they were based at Townsville and Port Moresby respectively. Seventeen P-40 Kittyhawks of No.75 Squadron, recently formed at Townsville, were deployed to Port Moresby in mid-March. Commanded by Squadron Leader John Jackson, the squadron suffered heavy losses in the ensuing battle. At one point NEA headquarters gave Jackson permission to withdraw but he refused, and the squadron was eventually credited with destroying thirty-five Japanese aircraft in the air and on the ground, securing Port Moresby until relieved by the 35th and 36th Squadrons of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), operating P-39 Airacobras.|$|E
5|$|Since tool use is {{considered}} to be a key feature of primate intelligence, the <b>apparent</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> this behavior in wild lemurs, as well as the lack of non-food object play, has helped reinforce the perception that lemurs are less intelligent than their simian cousins. However, another study at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve examined the representation of tool functionality in both the ring-tailed lemur and the common brown lemur and discovered that, like monkeys, they used tools with functional properties (e.g., tool orientation or ease of use) instead of tools with nonfunctional features (e.g., color or texture). Although the ring-tailed lemur may not use tools in the wild, it can not only be trained to use a tool, but will preferentially select tools based on their functional qualities. Therefore, the conceptual competence to use a tool may have been present in the common primate ancestor, even though the use of tools may not have appeared until much later.|$|E

40|$|Innovation {{management}} has recently received much attention from research, industry and state support. However, {{much of the}} research has focused on large enterprises with much available financial wealth and required planning infrastructure, in order to be effective at managing innovation. This paper aims to understand the factors that affect the innovation management process within Turkish SMEs. A number of interviews are conducted with 25 SMEs using three different innovation auditing models to capture and validate best practice techniques. The goals of the analysis are (a) to understand the Turkish SMEs current capabilities and innovation management practices in each organization and (b) to identify a set of recommendations that may facilitate and enhance innovation management in all participated SMEs. Results showed {{that the majority of the}} SMEs have <b>apparent</b> <b>lacking</b> <b>of</b> innovation strategic plan, culture, formal process and assessment approach to measure impact of innovation project.

5|$|The Waleses made Sandringham House their {{preferred}} residence, with Marlborough House their London base. Biographers agree that their marriage {{was in many}} ways a happy one; however, some have asserted that Albert Edward did not give his wife as much attention as she would have liked and that they gradually became estranged, until his attack of typhoid fever (the disease which was believed to have killed his father) in late 1871 brought about a reconciliation. This is disputed by others, who point out Alexandra's frequent pregnancies throughout this period and use family letters to deny the existence of any serious rift. Nevertheless, the prince was severely criticised from many quarters of society for his <b>apparent</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> interest in her very serious illness with rheumatic fever. Throughout their marriage Albert Edward continued to keep company with other women, including the actress Lillie Langtry; Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick; humanitarian Agnes Keyser; and society matron Alice Keppel. Alexandra knew about most of these relationships, and later permitted Alice Keppel to visit the king as he lay dying. Alexandra herself remained faithful throughout her marriage.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of the}} circumstellar {{habitable}} zone {{was introduced}} in 1953 by Hubertus Strughold and Harlow Shapley and in 1959 by Su-Shu Huang as the region around a star in which an orbiting planet could retain water at its surface. From the 1970s, planetary scientists and astrobiologists began to consider various other factors required for the creation and sustenance of life, including the impact that a nearby supernova may have on life's development. In 1981, Jim Clarke proposed that the <b>apparent</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way {{could be explained by}} Seyfert-type outbursts from an active galactic nucleus, with Earth alone being spared from this radiation by virtue of its location in the galaxy. In the same year, Wallace Hampton Tucker analyzed galactic habitability in a more general context, but later work superseded his proposals.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} the current practices of customer satisfaction survey (CSS) among Malaysian libraries. A self-developed questionnaire was used to gauge the respondents’ opinions on the implementation of CSS in their library. The questionnaire was distributed to 150 Malaysian libraries comprising samples of academic, public and special libraries. Descriptive and crosstabs statistics {{were used in the}} data analysis. The results of the study revealed that most libraries 1) start to implement CSS from year 2000 to 2010; 2) have applied CSS as a part of ISO requirement; 3) generally CSS is managed by Customer Services Division, 4) use Self Develop Instruments and study will be done on a yearly basis. The results also revealed that there are <b>apparent</b> <b>lacks</b> <b>of</b> CSS training and results distribution among the library staff. There are few suggestions on improving CSS such as forming focus group discussion, online survey, involve more respondents and create CSS standard among Malaysian library...|$|R

A minimum sample of 370 families was used and distributed for them questionnaire using the Stratified Relatively Sample. Chi Square was employed to analyze the statistical data and converted them into tables, percentages and graphics. The environmental awareness of citizens and methods of getting rid of the domestic garbage are playing an effective role in limiting the size of the resulting garbage problem. Where, 41. 1 % of the families save the garbage in plastic bags, and this is Ineffective way, and 39 % of them do not commit to the specific times of removing the garbage. The <b>apparent</b> <b>lacks</b> <b>of</b> mechanisms, equipments and labors used in the process of cleaning in the Environment Protection Agency have led to the increase of the problem in the city.

40|$|Abstract. The {{gas in the}} cores of many {{clusters}} and groups of galaxies has a short radiative cooling time. Energy from the central black hole is observed to flow into this gas by means of jets, bubbles and sound waves. Cooling is thus offset by heating. We discuss the mechanisms involved and observed in the X-ray brightest {{clusters and}} explore {{the closeness of the}} heating/cooling balance. It is surprisingly tight on the cooling side when soft X-ray spectra are examined. Non-radiative cooling by mixing is suggested as a means to relax the <b>apparent</b> strong <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> cooling. Nevertheless the heating and cooling must balance on average to better than 20 per cent...|$|R
