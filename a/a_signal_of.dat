40|$|DE 102008052172 A 1 UPAB: 20100430 NOVELTY - The device (100) has <b>a</b> {{correction}} <b>signal</b> generator (110), {{which is}} designed to produce <b>a</b> correction <b>signal</b> (140) based on a superimposition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> digital reference <b>signal</b> (130) and <b>a</b> superimposed output <b>signal.</b> The superimposed output signal is based on the superimposition <b>of</b> the output <b>signal</b> (102) and <b>an</b> analog reference <b>signal</b> (120). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following: (1) a system for linearizing <b>an</b> output <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> non-linear element; (2) a method for producing <b>a</b> correction <b>signal</b> for linearizing <b>an</b> output <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> non-linear element; (3) a method for linearizing <b>an</b> output <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> non-linear element; and (4) a computer program. USE - Device for producing <b>a</b> correction <b>signal</b> for linearizing <b>an</b> output <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> non-linear element in a system (Claimed). ADVANTAGE - The device has <b>a</b> correction <b>signal</b> generator, {{which is designed}} to produce <b>a</b> correction <b>signal</b> based on <b>a</b> superimposition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> digital reference <b>signal</b> and <b>a</b> superimposed output <b>signal,</b> and hence ensures reducing the requirement of a portion of the used digital components...|$|R
5|$|Aerial {{operations}} for the incursion {{got off to a}} slow start. Reconnaissance flights over the operational area were restricted since MACV believed that they might serve as <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> intention. The role of the Air Force in the planning for the incursion itself was minimal at best, in part to preserve the secrecy of Menu which was then considered an overture to the thrust across the border.|$|E
5|$|Hannibal {{had been}} exposed to the {{combined}} French and Spanish fire for four hours, and had lost two masts and more than 140 men killed and wounded. In an effort to preserve the lives of his crew, Ferris ordered his men to shelter below decks, but at 14:00 fires broke out on the ship and Ferris, isolated by Saumarez's withdrawal, surrendered his ship. French boarding parties extinguished the fires and rehung the struck ensign upside down to signify that Hannibal had surrendered. However, in the Royal Navy an inverted flag is <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> distress, and at least one British ship's boat was captured while attempting to bring assistance to Ferris before the misunderstanding was realised.|$|E
5|$|The {{battleship}} race soon accelerated once more, {{placing a}} great {{burden on the}} finances of the governments which engaged in it. The first dreadnoughts were not much {{more expensive than the}} last pre-dreadnoughts, but the cost per ship continued to grow thereafter. Modern battleships were the crucial element of naval power in spite of their price. Each battleship was <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> national power and prestige, {{in a manner similar to}} the nuclear weapons of today. Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Japan and Austria all began dreadnought programmes, and second-rank powers including the Ottoman Empire, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile commissioned dreadnoughts to be built in British and American yards.|$|E

Woodfull started the season by scoring 121 and leading his state to an 88-run win over the tourists ahead of the Tests. It was <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> what was to follow in the Tests. He then managed only 32 and nine as Victoria narrowly lost to South Australia by 21 runs.|$|E
5|$|The kudu horn {{is another}} Wood Badge symbol. Baden-Powell first {{encountered}} the kudu horn at the Battle of Shangani, where he discovered how the Matabele warriors {{used it to}} quickly spread <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> alarm. He used the horn at the first Scout encampment at Brownsea Island in 1907. It is used from the early Wood Badge courses to signal {{the beginning of the}} course or an activity, and to inspire Scouters to always do better.|$|E
5|$|Thirteen {{species of}} fleas in the genera Ceratophyllus and Dasypsyllus {{have been found}} on this bunting, and {{internal}} parasites include Ascaridia galli. The yellowhammer may carry haematozoan blood parasites such as Haemoproteus coatneyi. Males with high parasite levels produced fewer offspring (there is no such effect for females), and {{tend to be less}} brightly coloured. The striking plumage of the male may therefore have arisen as <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> fitness to breed. Yellowhammers infected with Haemoproteus may have lower winter survival rates due to a tendency to having shorter wings.|$|E

5|$|Titian was a {{personal}} friend of Charles; the commissioning of the portrait was most likely intended by Paul as <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> allegiance to the emperor. Pressure from reforming monarchs in France and Spain, coupled with a general shift of influence in France's favour, ended the Farnese hold on the papacy soon after Paul's death. Ottavio excelled as a military commander and was awarded the Golden Fleece by the emperor. While the post had been given {{as a means to}} strengthen the family position, it did not come without cost. His success bred resentment amongst his family, as he began to see himself unaccountable to Rome.|$|E
5|$|About 90% of beetle species enter {{a period}} of adult diapause, a quiet phase with reduced {{metabolism}} to tide unfavourable environmental conditions. Adult diapause {{is the most common}} form of diapause in Coleoptera. To endure the period without food (often lasting many months) adults prepare by accumulating reserves of lipids, glycogen, proteins and other substances needed for resistance to future hazardous changes of environmental conditions. This diapause is induced by signals heralding the arrival of the unfavourable season; usually the cue is photoperiodic. Short (decreasing) day length serves as <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> approaching winter and induces winter diapause (hibernation). A study of hibernation in the Arctic beetle Pterostichus brevicorni showed that the body fat levels of adults were highest in autumn with the alimentary canal filled with food, but empty by the end of January. This loss of body fat was a gradual process, occurring in combination with dehydration.|$|E
5|$|Aloy {{helps the}} Nora tribe {{fight off the}} Eclipse and then enters the door beneath the Nora mountain. She finds a {{recording}} left behind by GAIA, revealing that <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> unknown origin caused HADES to activate and seize control of her functions. As a last resort, GAIA self-destructed {{in order to stop}} HADES. Without GAIA to maintain the terraforming process, the entire system began to break down. As a contingency plan, GAIA created a clone of Dr. Sobeck in the form of Aloy, in the hope that she would find GAIA's message, destroy HADES, and restore GAIA's functions. Aloy learns that Dr. Sobeck sacrificed her life to ensure the Faro robot swarm would not find GAIA. Aloy manages to obtain the System Override necessary to destroy HADES. Sylens admits that he was the original founder of the Eclipse, originally tempted by HADES' promises of knowledge. With Sylens's help, Aloy surmises that HADES wants to send a signal to reactivate the Faro robots so that they can once again extinguish all life on Earth. Aloy kills Helis and helps fight off waves of corrupted machines, before stabbing HADES with Sylens' lance, ending the war. Aloy then journeys to Dr. Sobeck's old home, where she finds her corpse, and has a moment of mourning for her predecessor. In a post-credits scene, HADES is shown to still be alive, but trapped by Sylens, who intends to interrogate HADES to find out who sent the signal that activated it in the first place.|$|E
