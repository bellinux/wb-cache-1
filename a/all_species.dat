5|$|Like <b>all</b> <b>species</b> in the Isopogon genus, I.anethifolius has 13 haploid chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|<b>All</b> <b>species</b> in {{the genus}} Adiantum are {{currently}} {{placed in the}} subfamily Vittarioideae of family Pteridaceae {{on the basis of}} molecular phylogenetic evidence.|$|E
5|$|<b>All</b> <b>species</b> of Cucurbita have 20 {{pairs of}} chromosomes. Many North and Central American species are visited by {{specialist}} pollinators in the apid tribe Eucerini, especially the genera Peponapis and Xenoglossa, and these squash bees can {{be crucial to}} the flowers producing fruit after pollination.|$|E
50|$|Pseudomicrodon is a genus of hoverflies, with 13 known <b>species.</b> <b>All</b> are <b>species</b> with petiolate abdomens.|$|R
50|$|The genus Planiliza was resurrected {{for nearly}} <b>all</b> Indo-Pacific <b>species</b> {{assigned}} to Liza because DNA-based cladistic analyses recovered Liza as polyphyletic, with some species placed as sister to the Chelon type <b>species</b> and nearly <b>all</b> Indo-Pacific <b>species</b> to Planiliza.|$|R
50|$|Until recently, the Burkholderia genus was {{inclusive}} of <b>all</b> Paraburkholderia <b>species.</b> However, the Paraburkholderia genus is phylogenetically distinct, {{and can be}} distinguished from <b>all</b> Burkholderia <b>species</b> on the premise of molecular signatures that are uniquely found for each genus.|$|R
5|$|Scientists have {{commonly}} understood Tyrannosauroidea {{to include}} the tyrannosaurids and their immediate ancestors. With the advent of phylogenetic taxonomy in vertebrate paleontology, however, the clade has received several more explicit definitions. The first was by Paul Sereno in 1998, where Tyrannosauroidea {{was defined as a}} stem-based taxon including <b>all</b> <b>species</b> sharing a more recent common ancestor with Tyrannosaurus rex than with neornithean birds. To make the family more exclusive, Thomas Holtz redefined it in 2004 to include <b>all</b> <b>species</b> more closely related to Tyrannosaurus rex than to Ornithomimus velox, Deinonychus antirrhopus or Allosaurus fragilis. Sereno published a new definition in 2005, using Ornithomimus edmontonicus, Velociraptor mongoliensis and Troodon formosus as external specifiers. The Sereno definition was adopted in a 2010 review.|$|E
5|$|The Viduidae is {{a family}} of small {{passerine}} birds native to Africa that includes indigobirds and whydahs. <b>All</b> <b>species</b> are brood parasites, which lay their eggs in the nests of estrildid finches. Species usually have black or indigo predominating in their plumage.|$|E
5|$|The below {{cladogram}} follows Longrich (2015), who named a {{new species}} of Pentaceratops, and included nearly <b>all</b> <b>species</b> of chasmosaurine.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{cholesterol}} pathways are conserved in <b>all</b> three <b>species</b> (and other primate <b>species).</b> In <b>all</b> three <b>species,</b> {{immune response}} genes are under positive selection, and genes of T cell-mediated immunity, signal transduction, cell adhesion, and membrane proteins generally. Genes for keratin, which produce hair shafts, were rapidly evolving in <b>all</b> three <b>species,</b> possibly because {{of climate change}} or mate selection. The X chromosome has three times more rearrangements than other chromosomes. The macaque gained 1,358 genes by duplication.|$|R

50|$|<b>All</b> {{nineteen}} <b>species</b> {{inhabit the}} Australasian region.|$|R
5|$|The procellariids are {{the most}} {{numerous}} family of tubenoses, and the most diverse. They {{range in size from}} the giant petrels, which are almost as large as the albatrosses, to the prions, which are as small as the larger storm petrels. They feed on fish, squid and crustacea, with many also taking fisheries discards and carrion. <b>All</b> <b>species</b> are accomplished long-distance foragers, and many undertake long trans-equatorial migrations. They are colonial breeders, exhibiting long-term mate fidelity and site philopatry. In <b>all</b> <b>species,</b> each pair lays a single egg per breeding season. Their incubation times and chick-rearing periods are exceptionally long compared to other birds.|$|E
5|$|A {{few other}} (but not <b>all)</b> <b>species</b> of maple (Acer) are also {{sometimes}} used {{as sources of}} sap for producing maple syrup, including the box elder or Manitoba maple (Acer negundo), the silver maple (A. saccharinum), and the bigleaf maple (A. macrophyllum). Similar syrups may also be produced from birch or palm trees, among other sources.|$|E
5|$|<b>All</b> <b>species</b> {{experienced}} over-hunting by sealers. The Hawaiian {{monk seal}} experienced population drops in the 19th century and during World War II, and the Caribbean monk seal was exploited since the 1500s until the 1850s, when populations were {{too low to}} hunt commercially. The Mediterranean monk seal has experienced commercial hunting since the Middle Ages and eradication by fishermen. Monk seals have developed a fear of humans, and may even abandon beaches due to human presence. There are currently around 1,700 monk seals in total.|$|E
50|$|<b>All</b> the <b>species</b> are {{endemic to}} Australia.|$|R
50|$|<b>All</b> the <b>species</b> {{are native}} to Jamaica.|$|R
50|$|<b>All</b> Cathartes <b>species</b> have featherless {{heads with}} brightly colored skin, yellow to orange in the yellow-headed vultures, bright {{red in the}} turkey vulture. <b>All</b> three <b>species</b> share a {{well-developed}} sense of smell, which is rare in birds, {{that enables them to}} locate carrion under the canopy.|$|R
5|$|<b>All</b> <b>species</b> of cone snails are venomous and can sting painfully when handled, {{although}} many species {{are too small}} to pose much of a risk to humans, and only a few fatalities have been reliably reported. Their venom is a complex mixture of toxins, some fast-acting and others slower but deadlier. The effects of individual cone-shell toxins on victims' nervous systems are so precise as to be useful tools for research in neurology, and the small size of their molecules makes it easy to synthesize them.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{immediately}} threatened, crested and marbled newts suffer from population declines, caused mainly by habitat loss and fragmentation. Both their aquatic breeding sites and the cover-rich, natural landscapes upon which they depend during their terrestrial phase are affected. <b>All</b> <b>species</b> are legally protected in Europe, {{and some of}} their habitats have been designated as special reserves.|$|E
5|$|Amanita exitialis is {{classified}} in the section Phalloideae of the genus Amanita. Species of this section share the following characteristics: spores that are not strongly elongated, and never with a cylindrical shape; flesh not reddening upon bruising; lamellulae (short gills that do not reach {{the edge of the}} cap) abruptly cut off; a well-formed pouch- or sac-like membranous volva. <b>All</b> <b>species</b> of Phalloideae are ectomycorrhizal and contain amatoxins.|$|E
40|$|The chemical, bioactive, and {{antioxidant}} {{potential of}} twenty wild culinary mushroom species being {{consumed by the}} people of northern Himalayan regions has been evaluated {{for the first time in}} the present study. Nutrients analyzed include protein, crude fat, fibres, carbohydrates, and monosaccharides. Besides, preliminary study on the detection of toxic compounds was done on these species. Bioactive compounds evaluated are fatty acids, amino acids, tocopherol content, carotenoids (β-carotene, lycopene), flavonoids, ascorbic acid, and anthocyanidins. Fruitbodies extract of <b>all</b> the <b>species</b> was tested for different types of antioxidant assays. Although differences were observed in the net values of individual <b>species</b> <b>all</b> the <b>species</b> were found to be rich in protein, and carbohydrates and low in fat. Glucose was found to be the major monosaccharide. Predominance of UFA (65 – 70 %) over SFA (30 – 35 %) was observed in <b>all</b> the <b>species</b> with considerable amounts of other bioactive compounds. <b>All</b> the <b>species</b> showed higher effectiveness for antioxidant capacities...|$|R

5|$|Clutch size {{depends on}} the {{location}} and the food source, but generally Aerodramus swiftlets lay one or two eggs. The eggs are a dull white, and are laid every other day. Many, if not <b>all,</b> <b>species</b> are colonial nesters; some build their nests in high, dark corners on cave walls.|$|E
5|$|Globally, pelican {{populations are}} {{adversely}} affected by four main factors: declining supplies of fish through overfishing or water pollution, destruction of habitat, direct effects of human activity such as disturbance at nesting colonies, hunting and culling, entanglement in fishing lines and hooks, and lastly the presence of pollutants such as DDT and endrin. Most species' populations {{are more or less}} stable, although three are classified by the IUCN as being at risk. <b>All</b> <b>species</b> breed readily in zoos, which is potentially useful for conservation management.|$|E
5|$|In <b>all</b> <b>species</b> {{copulation}} {{takes place}} at the nest site; it begins shortly after pairing and continues for 3–10days before egg-laying. The male brings the nesting material, in ground-nesting species (which may not build a nest) sometimes in the pouch, and in tree-nesting species crosswise in the bill. The female then heaps the material up to form a simple structure.|$|E

5|$|In nearly <b>all</b> <b>species</b> of birds, an individual's sex is {{determined}} at fertilisation. However, {{one recent study}} demonstrated temperature-dependent sex determination among the Australian brushturkey, for which higher temperatures during incubation resulted in a higher female-to-male sex ratio. This, however, was later proven to not be the case. These birds do not exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination, but temperature-dependent sex mortality.|$|E
5|$|Like <b>all</b> <b>species</b> {{remaining}} in the genus Collybia, C.cirrhata is saprobic, and is typically found growing on the decaying or blackened remains of other mushrooms; occasionally the fruit bodies may be found growing on moss or soil without any apparent connection to decaying mushrooms, although these observations may represent instances where the remnant host tissue—possibly from a previous season—has decayed {{to such an extent}} that it remains as buried fragments in the substrate. Known hosts include Lactarius, Russula, Meripilus giganteus, and Bovista dermoxantha.|$|E
5|$|More {{problematic}} for non-commercial plants is the fungus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. narcissi, which causes basal rot (rotting of the bulbs and yellowing of the leaves). This {{is the most}} serious disease of Narcissus. Since the fungus can remain in the soil for many years it is necessary to remove infected plants immediately, and to avoid planting further narcissi at that spot for a further five years. Not <b>all</b> <b>species</b> and cultivars are equally susceptible. Relatively resistant forms include N. triandrus, N. tazetta and N. jonquilla.|$|E
