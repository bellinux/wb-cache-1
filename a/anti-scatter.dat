50|$|The {{single most}} {{important}} parameter that influences {{the performance of a}} <b>anti-scatter</b> grid, is the grid ratio. The grid ratio is the ratio of the height to the width of the interspaces (not the grid bars) in the grid. Grid ratios of 8:1, 10:1, and 12:1 are most common on radiography. A 5:1 grid is most common for mammography. The grid is essentially a one-dimensional Collimator and increasing the grid ration increases the degree of collimation. Higher grid ratios provide better scatter cleanup, but they also result in greater radiation doses to the patient.|$|E

As a result, much effort is being placed on reducing the k 1 for hole patterning to the range of 0. 35 - 0. 40. However, the consequences of operating at such low k 1 values are a small DOF, reduced exposure latitude, and high MEF. To achieve this level of k 1, it is necessary to employ resolution enhancement techniques that require phase shifting reticles and/or strong off axis illumination. Recent results show that by using strong off axis illumination to achieve resolution for the dense pitch contacts and by adding subresolution scattering bars for the semi dense to isolated, it is possible to achieve contact hole imaging through the entire pitch range. [1] To generate such reticle designs, the current technique commonly used is to apply a set of rules to define the assist features (scattering bars, <b>anti-scattering</b> bars, non-printing assist features, phase shifted and non-phase shifted) through pitch, whether for binary or attenuated phase shifting reticles.

40|$|<b>Anti-scatter</b> grids {{have been}} widely used to reject scatter and {{increase}} the perceptibility of low-contrast object in chest radiography; however they also attenuate the primary x-rays, resulting in a substantial degradation of primary information. Compensation for this degradation requires the use of higher exposure technique hence higher dose to the patient. A more efficient approach to reject scatter is the slot-scan imaging technique which employs a narrow scanning x-ray fan beam in conjunction with a slit or slot shaped solid state detector or an area detector used with an aft-collimator. With this approach, scatter can be rejected effectively without the need to attenuate primary x-rays. This paper demonstrates an electronic aft-collimation method, referred to as the alternate line erasure and readout (ALER) technique, for implementing the slot-scan digital radiography with a modern flat-panel detector. With this technique, instead of first exposing the detector and then reading the image line by line, the image line on {{the leading edge of the}} scanning fan beam is reset to erase the scatter accumulated prior to the arrival of the fan beam x-rays, while the image line on the trailing edge of the scanning fan beam is read out to acquire the image signals following the fan-beam exposure. These reset and readout processes are alternated and repeated as the x-ray fan beam scans across the detector. An anthropomorphic chest phantom was imaged to evaluate the scatter rejection ability and the low-contrast performance for the ALER technique and compare them with those for the <b>anti-scatter</b> grid method in full-field chest imaging.

40|$|Breast {{cancer has}} a {{significant}} impact on the well-being of the female population both nationwide and worldwide. This bas motivated the establishment of national breast screening programmes in most western countries, in order to reduce the mortality associated with this disease via early detection. X-ray mammography is considered the current gold standard technique for breast cancer detection in such screening programmes. However, this suffers from performance limitations due to tissue superposition which can either mimic or obscure malignant pathology. Therefore, alternative X-ray modalities, such as digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), which employs a series of X-ray projections at different (but limited) angles, are being explored in order to improve breast cancer detection rates. In all such X-ray based imaging methods, scattered photons produced deleterious effects on image quality to varying degrees. In order to model such scatter distribution, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations is often chosen as the default approach, and as such is used in this thesis to quantify its effect-s in X-ray mammography and DBT scenarios. Following validation on the use of the GEANT 4 MC package for use in mammography, three commercially available full-field digital mammography (FFDM) systems were simulated with their corresponding <b>anti-scatter</b> grids using a CDMAM geometry. It was observed that, for the particular geometry studied, the scattered radiation recorded at the detector was 17 % using a linear <b>anti-scatter</b> grid design. However, this figure was reduced by a factor of three when employing a cellular <b>anti-scatter</b> grid geometry. In DBT geometries, scattered radiation is larger than in FFDM and, spatially, may vary more rapidly due to the absence of an <b>anti-scatter</b> grid. The excessively long times needed to run MC simulations (8 - 10 hours) for such analysis motivates the need for an alternative approach. A non-stationary kernel-based approach has thus been developed. It was found that using kernels based on breast thickness-only, can overestimate scatter radiation by more than 60 % (compared to MC simulations) at the breast edge region. Simulation work presented here shows that this overestimation in scatter is largely due to the air gap between the lower curved breast edge and the image receptor. In t his thesis, a more accurate scatter field estimator is proposed for use in DBT which not only considers the breast thickness and primary incidence angle, but also accounts for scatter exiting the breast edge region and traversing an air gap prior to absorption in the image receptor. This proposed approach has reduced such errors to an average error of 10 % in scatter, and a maximum of 20 % across the projected breast phantom, and has decreased the run-time ten-fold. Such an approach has potential applications in scatter correction methods in DBT, and as an efficient modelling tool in imaging system development and in evaluation of virtual clinical trials.

40|$|International audiencePurpose: In digital X-ray radiography, an <b>anti-scatter</b> grid is {{inserted}} between {{the patient and}} the image receptor to reduce scattered radiation. If the <b>anti-scatter</b> grid is used in a stationary way, gridline artifacts will appear in the final image. In most of the gridline removal image processing methods, the useful information with spatial frequencies close to that of the gridline is usually lost or degraded. In this study, a new stationary gridline suppression method is designed to preserve more of the useful information. Methods: The method is as follows. The input image is first recursively decomposed into several smaller sub-images using a multi-scale 2 D discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The decomposition process stops when the gridline signal is found to be greater than a threshold in one or several of these sub-images using a gridline detection module. An automatic Gaussian band-stop filter is then applied to the detected sub-images to remove the gridline signal. Finally, the restored image is achieved using the corresponding 2 D inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT). Results: The processed images show that the proposed method can remove the gridline signal efficiently while maintaining the image details. The spectra of a 1 -dimensional Fourier transform of the processed images demonstrate that, compared with some existing gridline removal methods, the proposed method has better information preservation after the removal of the gridline artifacts. Additionally, the performance speed is relatively high. Conclusions: The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

40|$|Radiography using {{film has}} been an {{established}} method for imaging the internal organs of the body for over 100 years. Surveys carried out during the 1980 s identified a wide range in patient doses showing that there was scope for dosage reduction in many hospitals. This paper discusses factors {{that need to be}} considered in optimising the performance of radiographic equipment. The most important factor is choice of the screen/film combination, and the preparation of automatic exposure control devices to suit its characteristics. Tube potential determines the photon energies in the X-ray beam, with the selection involving a compromise between image contrast and the dose to the patient. Allied to this is the choice of <b>anti-scatter</b> grid, as a high grid ratio effectively removes the larger component of scatter when using higher tube potentials. However, a high grid ratio attenuates the X-ray beam more heavily. Decisions about grids and use of low attenuation components are particularly important for paediatric radiography, which uses lower energy X-ray beams. Another factor which can reduce patient dose is the use of copper filtration to remove more low-energy X-rays. Regular surveys of patient dose and comparisons with diagnostic reference levels that provide a guide representing good practice enable units for which doses are higher to be identified. Causes can then be investigated and changes implemented to address any shortfalls. Application of these methods has led to a gradual reduction in doses in many countries. © 2007 Biomedical Imaging and Intervention Journal. All rights reserved.

Methods: An anthropomorphic pelvis phantom was placed on a device that allowed the adjustment of different air gap thicknesses introduced between the phantom and the image receptor of Computed Radiography (CR) and Digital Radiography (DR) systems. Grid and non-grid images with different air gap thicknesses of both systems were produced. Ovary and testes doses were measured using thermoluminescent dosimeters. Radiographic quality of all images was rated by 5 experienced radiographers blindly using the Image Quality Score (IQS) and Visual Grading Analysis (VGA) systems. Results: Images of diagnostic quality were produced while the grid was replaced by a range of 0 - 25 cm air gap thickness in the pelvic radiographic examination. At non-grid examination with 10 cm air gap thickness, a maximum of relative dose reduction by 70. 7 % and 81. 6 % at CR; 68. 6 % and 79. 4 % at DR were achieved respectively at ovary and testes locations of the phantom as compared with their corresponding grid examinations.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Current {{research}} in the area of two-phase flow utilizes a wide variety of sensing devices, but some limitations exist on the information which can be obtained. Neutron radiography is a feasible alternative to "see" the two-phase flow. A system to perform neutron radiographic analysis of dynamic events which occur on the order of several milliseconds has been developed at Oregon State University. Two different methods have been used to radiograph the simulated two-phase flow. These pulsed or "flash" radiography and high speed movie neutron radiography serve as a "snapshot" with an exposure time ranging from 10 to 20 milliseconds. In high speed movie radiography, a scintillator is used to convert neutrons into light which is enhanced by an optical intensifier and then photographed by a high speed camera. Both types of radiography utilize the pulsing capability of the OSU TRIGA reactor. In order to predict the visibility of the images in two-phase flow, two computer codes, an SN program and a Monte Carlo program, have been written. The visibility is expressed in the relative neutron density on the film. The principle difficulty with this type of neutron radiography is the fogging of the image due to the large amount of scattering in the water. This difficulty can be overcome by using thin regions for the two-phase flow, heavy water instead of light water, or an <b>anti-scatter</b> grid. The improvement using an <b>anti-scatter</b> grid has been modeled with the computer programs.

40|$|The {{main problem}} {{connected}} to cone beam computed tomography (CT) systems for industrial applications employing 450 kV X-ray tubes {{is the high}} amount of scattered radiation which {{is added to the}} primary radiation (signal). This stray radiation leads to a significant degradation of the image quality. A better understanding of the scattering and methods to reduce its effects are therefore necessary to improve the image quality. Several studies have been carried out in the medical field at lower energies, whereas studies in industrial CT, especially for energies up to 450 kV, are lacking. Moreover, the studies reported in literature do not consider the scattered radiation generated by the CT system structure and the walls of the X-ray room (environmental scatter). In order to investigate the scattering on CT projections a GEANT 4 -based Monte Carlo (MC) model was developed. The model, which has been validated against experimental data, has enabled the calculation of the scattering including the environmental scatter, the optimization of an <b>anti-scatter</b> grid suitable for the CT system, and the optimization of the hardware components of the CT system. The investigation of multiple scattering in the CT projections showed that its contribution is 2. 3 times the one of primary radiation for certain objects.

The angiogenic activity was blocked by specific <b>anti-scatter</b> factor antibodies. Scatter factor induced cultured microvascular endothelial cells to accumulate and secrete significantly increased quantities of urokinase, an enzyme associated with development of an invasive endothelial phenotype during angiogenesis. We further showed that immunoreactive scatter factor is present surrounding sites of blood vessel formation in psoriatic skin. These findings suggest that scatter factor may act as a paracrine mediator in pathologic angiogenesis associated with human inflammatory disease...|$|E

H 577 P HTI 2015 Chanxliii, 378 pages :illustrations (some color); 30 cmRadiation {{safety to}} the {{patients}} in medical imaging is always of high importance. Spine and pelvic radiographic examinations that involve a relatively high radiation dose to the radiosensitive organs of the patients are of particularly concern. A major reason for the relatively high dose being delivered to patients in these examinations {{is caused by the}} application of an <b>anti-scatter</b> grid. To this end, the main theme {{of this study was to}} explore the feasibility of replacing the <b>anti-scatter</b> grid by an optimal air gap in spine and pelvic radiography to maximize the dose reduction effect in patients while retaining the resultant images of diagnostic quality in computed radiography (CR) and digital radiography (DR) systems using an anthropomorphic RANDO phantom. To gain a holistic picture on the mechanism of this dose reduction method, it was important to uncover the scientific basis on the dose and scatter distribution patterns in diagnostic radiography. One objective of this research project was to uncover the air kerma distribution patterns of the x-ray tube output and the subsequent scatter distribution within and around a homogenous scattering medium by generating the 3 D dose maps. These were achieved by the physical measurement of air kerma at selected sites by an ionization chamber detector or thermoluminescent dosimeters and, coupled with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations on the measured data. Results on the investigation of air kerma distribution patterns among the three different brands of x-ray tube revealed the unique skewed shape 3 D distribution maps from the output of the studied x-ray tubes. This finding filled the knowledge gap on the anode heel effect investigation as was reflected on the characteristics variation of radiation intensity output of the x-ray tube. Findings on the investigation of air kerma distribution patterns on the water-equivalent dry slabs phantom by MC simulation on the photon transport uncovered the non-uniform distribution of scatter inside and around the scattering medium, and were presented in three-dimensional maps. Results on the investigation of dose reduction by the air gap method using the RANDO phantom confirmed that significant dose reduction effect with retention of image quality at diagnostic level was confirmed in all of the tested radiographic examinations in both the CR and DR systems. These examinations included cervical spine, thoracic spine, lumbar spine, pelvis and full spine. Image Quality Score (IQS) and Visual Grading Analysis (VGA) tests were employed as the image evaluation methods for the assessors to determine the image quality of the images in according to the pre-set criteria. Among the non-grid images with different air gap thicknesses in place, those images being rated with the highest scores in both tests were considered as the best in image quality. Results on the IQS and VGA scores uncovered that the optimal air gap thickness for each of the tested radiographic examinations was in the range of 5 cm to 20 cm. By replacing the <b>anti-scatter</b> grid with an optimal air gap thickness, a substantial dose reduction effect ranging from 46. 7 % to 81. 6 % at the regions of radiosensitive organs of the tested RANDO phantom was evidenced. Effective doses simulated from the PCXMC 2. 0 program further revealed that a substantial dose reduction effect ranging from 50. 3 % to 80 % was found in the non-grid examinations with the optimal air gap thickness, which indicated that the risks on cancer induction could be reduced in the similar fashion. Of the same kind of radiographic examination, a further reduction in both the effective and organ doses by 3. 8 % to 18. 2 % were achieved while changing the imaging system from CR to DR. In conclusion, the use of an optimal air gap to replace the <b>anti-scatter</b> grid was proven to be an effective dose reduction method on high dose spine and pelvis radiographic examinations in both the CR and DR systems with image quality retained at the diagnostic level as was proven in the present study on a RANDO phantom model.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to evaluate the image quality of clinical Full Field Digital Mammography (FFDM) systems. This is done by evaluating image ac-quisition performance of clinical FFDM in a comprehensive way that accounts for scatter, focal spot un-sharpness, detector blur and <b>anti-scatter</b> grid performance using an anthro-pomorphic phantom. Additionally we intend to provide a limited evaluation of the effects that image processing in clinical FFDM has in signal detectability. Methodology: We explored different strategies {{and a variety of}} mathematical model observers in order to evaluate the performance of clinical FFDM systems under different conditions. To evaluate image acquisition performance, we tested a system-model-based Hotelling observer (SMHO) model on a bench-top system using a uniform anthropomor-phic phantom for an signal known exactly background known exactly (SKE/BKE) task. We then applied this concept on two clinical FFDM systems to compare their perfor-mance. In a limited study to evaluate the effects of image processing in the detectability of FFDM, we implemented the channelized Hotelling observer (CHO) model on clinically realistic images of an anatomical phantom for an SKE/BKE task...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{scattered}} photons cause {{reduction of}} the contrast of radiographic image and it results in the degradation {{of the quality of}} the image. In order to acquire better quality image, an anti-scattering x-ray gird should be equipped in radiography system. Materials and Methods: The X-ray anti-scattering grid of the inclined type based on the hybrid concept for that of parallel and focused type was tested by MCNP code. The MCNPX 2. 7. 0 was used for the simulation based test. The geometry for the test was based on the IEC 60627 which was an international standard for diagnostic X-ray imaging equipment-Characteristics of general purpose and mammographic <b>anti-scatter</b> grids. Results and Discussion: The performance of grids with four inclined shielding material types was compared with that of the parallel type. The grid with completely tapered type the best performance where there were little performance difference according to the degree of inclination. Conclusion: It was shown that the grid of inclined type had better performance than that of parallel one. ope...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} the optimum technique for the horizontal beam lateral (HBL) hip projection considering image quality and radiation dose. Methods: Using digital radiography equipment an anthropomorphic phantom was positioned for a HBL {{projection of the}} hip. Radiographic exposures were undertaken {{across a range of}} acquisition parameters (tube potentials, source to image distances, object to detector distances, with and without an <b>anti-scatter</b> radiation grid/additional copper filtration). Each acquisition combination was imaged three times and the dose area product (DAP) and post-AEC mAs recorded. 168 images were acquired. A single observer evaluated five anatomical areas on all images using a two-alternative force choice technique. The reference image was selected based on the current locally accepted technique. 50 images out of the original 168 were independently assessed by a further four observers to ensure reliability of the results. Results: Image quality, when comparing all the images to the reference, was improved on in two cases; however the radiation dose had increased. 18 images had equal image quality with some having an 80...|$|E
40|$|In mammography, the {{reduction}} of scattered X-rays is vital due to the low contrast or small dimension of the details that are searched for. The typical method of doing so in current conventional mammography is the <b>anti-scatter</b> grid. The disadvantage of this method is the absorption of a proportion of the primary beam and therefore an increase in dose is required {{to compensate for the}} loss of counts. An alternative method is proposed, using quasi-monochromatic beams and a pixellated spectroscopic detector. As Compton-scattered X-rays lose energy in the scattering process, they are detected at a lower energy in the spectrum. Therefore the spectrum can be windowed around the monochromatic energy peak, removing the scattered Xrays from the image. The work presented here shows contrast improvement of up to 50 % and contrast to noise ratio improvements of around 20 % for scatter free imaging in comparison to full spectrum imaging. Contrast improvements of around 45 % were found when comparing scatter free images to conventional polychromatic imaging for both the low contrast test object and the Rachel anthropomorphic breast phantom...|$|E
40|$|The {{shape of}} the energy {{spectrum}} produced by an x-ray tube has a great importance in mammography. Many anode-filtration combinations have been proposed to obtain the most effective spectrum shape for the image quality-dose relationship. On the other hand, third generation synchrotrons such as the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble are able to produce a high flux of monoenergetic radiation. It is thus a powerful tool to study the effect of beam energy on image quality and dose in mammography. An objective method {{was used to evaluate}} image quality and dose in mammography with synchrotron radiation and to compare them to standard conventional units. It was performed systematically in the energy range of interest for mammography through the evaluation of a global image quality index and through the measurement of the mean glandular dose. Compared to conventional mammography units, synchrotron radiation shows a great improvement of the image quality-dose relationship, which is due to the beam monochromaticity and to the high intrinsic collimation of the beam, which allows the use of a slit instead of an <b>anti-scatter</b> grid for scatter rejection...|$|E
