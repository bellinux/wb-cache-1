Objective: To test the usefulness of this formula as a new non invasive screening tool <b>for</b> <b>PH</b> <b>in</b> IPF patients.

Materials and Methods: Cross-sectional study of 37 IPF patients from tertiary hospital. The accuracy of MPAP estimation was assessed by examining {{the correlation between the}} predicted MPAP using the formula and PH diagnosed by other screening tools and patients&#x 2032; clinical signs of PH. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in the prediction of PH using cut off point of 21 or 25 mm Hg (p 0 = 0. 24).

The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the relation of NT-proBNP, fibrin D-dimer, troponin-T, uric acid and exhaled nitric oxide (NO) to the presence of <b>PH</b> and mortality <b>in</b> ILD. MethodsIn a previously described cohort of 212 ILD patients of whom 29 had PH, levels of the above mentioned biomarkers were analyzed as routine tests. ResultsA value of NT-proBNP below 95  ng/l had a negative predictive value <b>for</b> <b>PH</b> of 99 % (95 % CI: 94 – 100). Values of troponin-T were higher <b>in</b> patients with <b>PH</b> (median (inter quartile range)  =  9 (9 – 20) vs. 9 (9 – 10)  ng/l), and the odds ratio (OR) <b>for</b> <b>PH</b> was increased <b>in</b> patients with abnormal levels of uric acid (OR (95 % CI)  =  3. 1 (1. 1 – 8. 8)). NT-proBNP and troponin-T values above the 50 th percentile, and uric acid and fibrin D-dimer values above the 90 th percentile were each associated with increased mortality. ConclusionsA value of NT-proBNP below 95  ng/l may be used as a rule-out test <b>for</b> <b>PH</b> <b>in</b> ILD, while an abnormal value of uric acid is a risk factor <b>for</b> <b>PH.</b> NT-proBNP, troponin-T, uric acid and fibrin D-dimer have prognostic value in ILD patients, while exhaled levels of NO do not seem to predict PH or mortality...|$|R
