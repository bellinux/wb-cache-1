25|$|There is {{no simple}} method to measure the tension of <b>a</b> <b>fastener</b> already in place other than to tighten it and {{identify}} {{at which point the}} fastener starts extending. This is known as re-torqueing. An electronic torque wrench can be used on the fastener in question, so that the torque applied can be constantly measured as it is slowly increased in magnitude.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> Captive <b>fastener</b> {{is often}} made with thread locking, press-fitting, or {{broaching}} to accomplish an anchor-hold {{within a larger}} assembly housing. However, <b>a</b> captive <b>fastener</b> may also be melded with the material into which it is joined, either through cold forming or welding.|$|R

50|$|To become <b>a</b> proper <b>fastener,</b> <b>a</b> rivet {{should be}} placed in hole ideally 4-6 {{thousandths}} of an inch larger in diameter. This allows the rivet to be easily and fully inserted, then setting allows the rivet to expand, tightly filling the gap and maximizing strength.|$|R
25|$|A {{torque wrench}} {{is a tool}} used to {{precisely}} apply a specific torque to <b>a</b> <b>fastener</b> such as a nut or bolt. It is usually {{in the form of}} a socket wrench with special internal mechanisms. It was invented by Conrad Charles Bahr in 1918. However, it wasn't until much later on March 16, 1937, that Bahr received U.S. patent #2,074,079 for the invention of the torque wrench.|$|E
25|$|The clamp load, {{also called}} preload of <b>a</b> <b>fastener,</b> is created when a torque is applied, and so {{develops}} a tensile preload that is generally a substantial {{percentage of the}} fastener's proof strength. Fasteners are manufactured to various standards that define, among other things, their strength. Torque charts are available to specify the required torque for a given fastener based on its property class (fineness of manufacture and fit) and grade (tensile strength).|$|E
25|$|A bandeau may be {{fastened}} in {{the front}} or back or be sufficiently elastic {{so as not to}} need <b>a</b> <b>fastener</b> at all. A bandeau may come with a detachable halter strap, for extra support. A strapless bandeau, or tube top, was also worn as casual wear and sports wear starting in the 1970s, and is sometimes worn as part of a sportswear ensemble. Actress Halle Berry wore a skimpy bikini top with matching pants to the MTV Video Music Award, fueling the trend of wearing a bandeau top as an out-of-home dress.|$|E

25|$|In some applications, joints are {{designed}} so that the fastener eventually fails before more expensive components. In this case, replacing <b>an</b> existing <b>fastener</b> with <b>a</b> higher strength <b>fastener</b> can result in equipment damage. Thus, it is generally good practice to replace old fasteners with new fasteners of the same grade.|$|R
50|$|A crossbar, {{sometimes}} called a bolt, is <b>a</b> primitive <b>fastener</b> consisting simply of a post barring a door.|$|R
25|$|When <b>a</b> <b>fastener</b> is torqued, {{a tension}} preload {{develops}} in the bolt and an equal compressive preload develops in the parts being fastened. This can be modeled as a spring-like assembly {{that has some}} assumed distribution of compressive strain in the clamped joint components. When an external tension load is applied, it relieves the compressive strains induced by the preload in the clamped components, hence the preload acting on the compressed joint components provides the external tension load with a path (through the joint) other than through the bolt. In a well designed joint, perhaps 80-90% of the externally applied tension load will pass through the joint and the remainder through the bolt. This reduces the fatigue loading of the bolt.|$|E
25|$|The nail's design {{began when}} its inventor, civil {{engineer}} Ed Sutt, {{traveled to the}} Caribbean {{in the wake of}} Hurricane Marilyn. Sutt's trip to the Caribbean was part of a team examining the wreckage of the 80% of the island's homes and business that had been destroyed in the hurricane's winds of 95mph (155km/h). The finding among the homes that had been destroyed was that wood failure was not the cause of destruction; instead, the findings showed that the nails holding the wood together had failed, leading to the buildings' ultimate collapse. Sutt's research began after taking a research assistantship program at the Clemson Wind Load Test Facility, which had received funding through a grant from FEMA. The grant was used to research wooden-framed structures and the relationship of their failure to wind velocity. The outcome of the project's research showed {{that the best way to}} strengthen a structure was to improve the fasteners that held the roofing and wall sheathing to the internal frame, and with this information Sutt signed on as <b>a</b> <b>fastener</b> engineer for the Stanley subsidiary, Bostitch.|$|E
25|$|A {{lockbolt}} is <b>a</b> <b>fastener</b> {{similar to}} a bolt in appearance and function. However, instead of using screw threads which connect to a nut using a turning motion, a lockbolt has annular grooves around the shaft of the bolt (pin). After placing the lockbolt in a hole, a threadless collar is forced at high pressures around the annular grooves, deforming the collar and permanently locking it into place around the grooves. Swaging is the generic term for setting a lockbolt and collar assembly. During the installation cycle of a lockbolt, the collar is deformed around the pin with locking grooves using special tooling. The tool engages onto the pintail, which is an extra portion of pin material protruding past the collar that the tool grabs and pulls. This force on the pintail pushes the joint together, and the conically-shaped cavity of the tooling is forced down the collar, which reduces its diameter and progressively swages the collar material into the grooves of the harder pin. As the force required for swaging increases during the process, the installation is finalised when the pintail breaks off.|$|E

25|$|The preload {{achieved}} by torquing a bolt {{is caused by}} the part of the torque that is effective. Friction in the threads and under the nut or bolt head use up some fraction of the applied torque. Much of the torque applied is lost overcoming friction under the torqued bolt head or nut (50%) and in the threads (40%). The remaining 10% of the applied torque does useful work in stretching the bolt and providing the preload. Initially, as the torque is applied, it must overcome static friction under the head of the bolt or nut (depending on which end is being torqued) and also in the threads. Finally, dynamic friction prevails and the torque is distributed in a 50/40/10 % manner as the bolt is tensioned. The torque value is dependent on the friction produced in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut and the fastened material or washer if used. This friction can be affected by the application of a lubricant or any plating (e.g. cadmium or zinc) applied to the threads, and the fastener's standard defines whether the torque value is for dry or lubricated threading, as lubrication can reduce the torque value by 15% to 25%; lubricating <b>a</b> <b>fastener</b> designed to be torqued dry could over-tighten it, which may damage threading or stretch the fastener beyond its elastic limit, thereby reducing its clamping ability.|$|E

2500|$|Considering {{the early}} cemeteries of Kent, most {{relevant}} finds come from furnished graves with distinctive {{links to the}} Continent. However, there are some unique items, these include pots and urns and especially brooches, {{an important element of}} female dress that functioned as <b>a</b> <b>fastener,</b> rather like a modern safety pin. The style of brooches (called Quoits), is unique to southern England in the fifth century AD, with the greatest concentration of such items occurring in Kent. Seiichi Suzuki defines the style through an analysis of its design organisation, and, by comparing it with near-contemporary styles in Britain and on the continent, identifying those features which make it unique. He suggests that the quoit brooch style was made and remade as {{part of the process of}} construction of new group identities during the political uncertainties of the time, and sets the development of the style in the context of the socio-cultural dynamics of an emergent post-Roman society. The brooch shows that culture was not just transposed from the continent, but from an early phase a new [...] "Anglo-Saxon" [...] culture was being developed.|$|E

For plating, medium usage is usually 1 part medium for every workpiece, but for galvanization the ratio is 2:1.
