I just fell in love with it; it gets under your skin. Woodside Petroleum are planning to build one of the world's biggest LNG (liquified natural gas) processing plants on the Kimberley coast, just north of Broome. They would be drilling for the gas out at sea and bringing it onshore at this plant, which would just be devastating for the region.

500|$|The series' {{introduction}} of the Inhumans was seen by Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club as making Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. {{an essential part of}} the MCU and Marvel Studios' plans, with the connections between the series and the films previously having always been reactive on the series' behalf, with [...] "stuff" [...] happening in the films, and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. dealing with the fallout of it.

500|$|Merrill Barr of Forbes {{thought that}} by not only {{introducing}} the Inhumans {{ahead of the}} film, but by depicting the spreading of the race throughout the world, {{was part of the}} series cementing its [...] "right to exist" [...] apart from the films.

Come the final frame, all anyone – Marvel fan or otherwise – will be <b>asking</b> <b>is</b> when season three begins. The note the show leaves viewers on is one that will make them realize, perhaps for the first time, that the journey of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is not only worth it now, but perhaps always has been." ...|$|E

Blige, [...] "The One". It premiered on VEVO on April 12, 2010. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, when asked about how the connection came about, Mandler said, [...] "I’m {{a big fan of}} Drake and I was really excited when he called me about doing it, and really put a lot into making it special and capturing what I think is an image he hasn’t had yet. Here’s a guy whose lyrical presence does not equal his visual presence yet, by any means. That’s something that he and I spoke a lot about. He felt strongly that nobody had really captured him, and some of the videos that had been done were less iconic than he would like to be represented as." [...] On Drake and the song he said, [...] "It’s so refreshing that he’s confident, but he’s not arrogant. I think that dimensionality is so important in a genre that is very one note with words like “bravado” and “swagger” and “arrogance” and “promiscuity.” Here’s a guy that’s finally putting a duality to the words and saying, “Yeah, I have all that and I do all that, but I’m also somebody that’s <b>asking,</b> <b>is</b> that what I should be doing with my life?" [...] When asked of the concept of the [...] "Over" [...] video, Mandler said that it was something that would not be expected. Mandler explained, [...] "Drake and I were very conscious about trying to push the limits and trying to push things forward. He came to me because he wanted to throw away the conventions of a medium, and take chances and be daring and take certain themes that are relevant to him and try to visualize them in not the obvious way".|$|E
