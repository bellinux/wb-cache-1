500|$|The war {{remained}} a frustrating stalemate for two years, with over 30,000 Americans killed, until an armistice ended {{the fighting in}} 1953. [...] In February 1952, Truman's <b>approval</b> <b>mark</b> stood at 22% according to Gallup polls, which is the all-time lowest <b>approval</b> <b>mark</b> for an active American president, though it was matched by Richard Nixon in 1974.|$|E
5000|$|The {{dismissal}} of General Douglas MacArthur ignited {{a firestorm of}} outrage against Truman and support for MacArthur. Fierce criticism from virtually all quarters accused Truman of refusing to shoulder the blame for a war gone sour and blaming his generals instead. Others, including Eleanor Roosevelt, supported and applauded Truman's decision. MacArthur meanwhile returned to the U.S. to a hero's welcome, and addressed {{a joint session of}} Congress. In part due to the {{dismissal of}} MacArthur, Truman's <b>approval</b> <b>mark</b> in February 1952 stood at 22% according to Gallup polls, which was, until George W. Bush in 2008, the all-time lowest <b>approval</b> <b>mark</b> for an active American president.|$|E

50|$|This {{first phase}} {{appeared}} in 1997 with the eMate, followed in 1998 {{with the release}} of the original Bondi-blue iMac (see below). This motif was later applied to the first iBook models released in 1999, and the Blue and White Power Mac G3 and their accompanying Studio Displays. The design was characterised by translucent surfaces with either a candy-like or milky-white coloring and soft, bulging contours. Subdued vertical pinstripes were made to show through the translucent faces of these products. Printed on the back panel for ports and agency <b>approval</b> <b>marks</b> was a lenticular plaque that contains a wavy 3D pattern.

[...] Of course, the VGN's more modern gradient and facilities and profitability were all coveted by the competition. There were many attempts to acquire it. All failed throughout {{the first half of the}} 20th century. Finally, as the Interstate Commerce Commission began to realize that railroads needed to be able to compete successfully with trucking and other modes of transportation more than primarily each other, in 1959, the Norfolk and Western succeeded in reaching a merge with the VGN and gaining regulatory <b>approvals,</b> <b>marking</b> what became called the [...] "modern merger era" [...] in North American railroading which eventually resulted in Princeton's current service by Norfolk Southern Railway, one of only 6 large class 1 railroads operating in the United States in the 21st century.|$|R

50|$|Johnson {{expected}} to lose {{seats in the}} 1966 mid-term elections, and chose to pursue a housing discrimination bill as his final major legislative goal of the 89th Congress. In April 1966, Johnson submitted a bill to Congress that barred owners from refusing to enter into agreements {{on the basis of}} race; the bill immediately garnered opposition from many of the northerners who had supported the last two major civil rights bills. Though a version of the bill passed the House, it failed to win Senate <b>approval,</b> <b>marking</b> Johnson's first major legislative defeat. The law gained new impetus after the April 4, 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., and the civil unrest across the country following King's death. On April 5, Johnson {{wrote a letter to the}} U.S. House of Representatives urging passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. With newly urgent attention from legislative director Joseph Califano and Democratic House Speaker John William McCormack, the bill passed the House by a wide margin on April 10. The Fair Housing Act, a component of the bill, outlawed housing discrimination, and allowed many African-Americans to move to the suburbs.|$|R
50|$|Visual {{prosthetics}} {{are being}} developed as a potentially valuable aid for individuals with visual degradation. Argus II, co-developed at the University of Southern California (USC) Eye Institute and manufactured by Second Sight Medical Products Inc., is now the only such device to have received marketing <b>approval</b> (CE <b>Mark</b> in Europe in 2011). Most other efforts remain investigational; the Retina Implant AG's Alpha IMS won a CE Mark July 2013 and is a significant improvement in resolution. It is not, however, FDA-approved in the US.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2017, pembrolizumab {{received}} an accelerated {{approval from the}} FDA for use in any unresectable or metastatic solid tumor with DNA mismatch repair deficiencies or a microsatellite instability-high state (or, {{in the case of}} colon cancer, tumors that have progressed following chemotherapy). This <b>approval</b> <b>marked</b> the first instance in which the FDA approved marketing of a drug based only on the presence of a genetic mutation, with no limitation {{on the site of the}} cancer or the kind of tissue in which it originated. [...] The approval was based on a clinical trial of 149 patients with microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient cancers who enrolled on one of five single-arm trials. Ninety patients had colorectal cancer, and 59 patients had one of 14 other cancer types. The objective response rate for all patients was 39.6%. Response rates were similar across all cancer types, including 36% in colorectal cancer and 46% across the other tumor types. Notably, there were 11 complete responses, with the remainder partial responses. Responses lasted for at least six months in 78% of responders. [...] Because the clinical trial was fairly small, Merck was obligated to conduct further post-marketing studies to ensure that the results are valid.|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, a {{piece of}} {{property}} became available at 1025 Bunn Drive in the northeast section of Princeton, with zoning appropriate for a church. After a lengthy process of <b>approvals,</b> <b>marked</b> by some vocal opposition, the congregation gained the requisite permissions to build and relocate. A new LEED certified facility of nearly 50,000 square feet was opened in December 2013. The church granted a permanent conservation easement over the wetlands on the southern third of the site, allowing for trail access to the Herrontown Woods Arboretum from Bunn Drive. With the departure from Westerly Road, a name change was deemed appropriate, and the church elders unanimously agreed upon Stone Hill Church of Princeton. The Stone Hill is {{a reference to the}} Rocky Hill Ridge on which the new building is located and the significant amount of stone that needed to be removed to allow for the foundation. [...] The original building was demolished to allow for subdivision into residential lots in accordance with the zoning. The new fellowship hall was named in honor of the Harris family, the three siblings who founded the church and donated the original land. The new prayer chapel was named in honor of Westerly and became home to the previous building's communion table and cross.|$|R

Some of these are legal in the country they are {{manufactured}} in, but do not meet BS 1363 - these can be brought into the UK by unsuspecting travellers, or people purchasing electrical goods online. They can also be purchased through many UK electrical component distributors. There are also counterfeit plugs which appear to meet the standards (and are marked as such) but do not in fact comply. Legislation was introduced, with the last revision in 1994, to require plugs sold to meet the technical standard. [...] Counterfeit products are regularly seized when found, to enforce the safety standards and to protect the <b>approval</b> <b>marks</b> and trademarks of imitated manufacturers. [...] The pressure group PlugSafe reported in March 2014 that since August 2011 [...] "thousands" [...] of listings of products including illegal plugs had been removed from the UK websites ebay.co.uk and amazon.co.uk. [...] The UK Electrical Safety Council expressed shock at the magnitude of the problem and published a video showing a plug exploding due to a counterfeit BS 1362 fuse.

40|$|European {{approval}} for Roche’s Pegasys personalises {{treatment for a}} subgroup of hepatitis C patients: chance for cure with only four months of treatment Roche also announces start of NCORE study to determine best length of treatment in patients who do not experience a rapid response Roche announced today that the European Commission has approved a shortened, 16 -week course of treatment with Pegasys (peginterferon alfa- 2 a (40 KD)) plus Copegus (ribavirin) for certain hepatitis C patients. The four-month treatment course will be for patients with particular strains of chronic hepatitis C (genotype 2 or 3) who have low virus levels before starting treatment, and who show a rapid virological response by clearing the virus from the blood within the first 4 weeks of treatment. This shorter treatment duration with Pegasys/Copegus will provide patients with the full benefits of therapy while reducing unnecessary drug exposure. This {{is good news for}} eligible patients as previously, all patients with genotype 2 or 3 hepatitis C (HCV) received 24 weeks of Pegasys/Copegus therapy, regardless of their baseline virus levels and response while on treatment. The <b>approval</b> <b>marks</b> an important milestone in a new treatment concept in hepatitis C, which is called “response-guided therapy ” and seeks to customise regimens for patients based on how well they respond to treatment. Response-guided therapy is enabled by the use of Roche's highly sensitive, real-time PCR diagnostic tests, which accurately measure the levels of virus in the patient's blood. The automated COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV Test is the newest and most advanced Roche product for measuring hepatitis C virus levels.
