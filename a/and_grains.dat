5|$|About {{three-quarters of}} dietary calcium is from dairy {{products}} <b>and</b> <b>grains,</b> the rest being {{accounted for by}} vegetables, protein-rich foods, fruits, sugar, fats, and oil. Calcium supplementation is controversial, as the bioavailability of calcium {{is strongly dependent on}} the solubility of the salt involved: calcium citrate, malate, and lactate are highly bioavailable while the oxalate is much less so. The intestine absorbs about one-third of calcium eaten as the free ion, and plasma calcium level is then regulated by the kidneys. Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D promote the formation of bone by allowing and enhancing the deposition of calcium ions there, allowing rapid bone turnover without affecting bone mass or mineral content. When plasma calcium levels fall, cell surface receptors are activated and the secretion of parathyroid hormone occurs; it then proceeds to stimulate the entry of calcium into the plasma pool by taking it from targeted kidney, gut, and bone cells, with the bone-forming action of parathyroid hormone being antagonised by calcitonin, whose secretion increases with increasing plasma calcium levels.|$|E

5|$|South Wind Through the Kitchen (1997) was the {{completion}} {{of one of the}} projects of David's later years on which she worked with Norman: a single-volume collection of the best of her extensive writings. Norman invited chefs, writers and David's friends to choose their favourite of her articles and recipes. Many of the contributors, such as the chef Simon Hopkinson, contributed an introduction or afterword to the pieces they chose. The extracts and recipes are taken from all David's books published by 1996. There are more than 200 recipes, organised in the customary way with sections on courses and ingredients—eggs and cheese, fish and shellfish, meat, poultry and game, vegetables, pasta, pulses <b>and</b> <b>grains,</b> sauces, sweet dishes and cakes, preserves, and bread—interspersed, as in David's earlier works, with articles and essays. The title of the book comes from an essay published in 1964 and reprinted in An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, and is a reference to South Wind, a novel by David's mentor Norman Douglas.|$|E
30|$|The smg 11 mutant {{produced}} small <b>grains</b> <b>and</b> dense, erect {{and short}} panicles, indicating that SMG 11 influences <b>grain</b> <b>and</b> panicle size. The secondary panicle branches <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> number per panicle in smg 11 were increased compared with KYJ, suggesting a possible balance mechanism between <b>grain</b> size <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> number. The smg 11 mutation {{occurred in the}} cytochrome P 450 CYP 90 D 2 /D 2, which is involved in BR biosynthesis (Hong et al., 2005). smg 11 is a novel allele of D 2 /CYP 90 D 2. The smg 11 also showed similar phenotypes to BR defective mutants, such as reduced leaf angle <b>and</b> small <b>grains</b> (Additional file 1 : Figures S 5 and S 6 a). Exogenous application of BL rescued the leaf angle phenotype of smg 11 (Additional file 1 : Fig. S 6), further suggesting that the smg 11 mutation influences BR biosynthesis. Although several rice d 2 alleles have been previously reported (Hong et al., 2003; Hong et al., 2005; Li et al., 2013), none of these alleles was reported to increase the panicle branches <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> number per panicle. Consistent {{with the role of}} SMG 11 in panicle branch <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> number control, expression of SMG 11 complemented the panicle branch <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> number phenotypes of smg 11, and strong expression of SMG 11 decreased panicle branches <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> number per panicle.|$|R

5|$|This sparrow feeds {{mainly on}} the seeds of herbs <b>and</b> <b>grains,</b> but it also eats berries and insects, {{particularly}} during the breeding season. This diet makes it a minor pest in agricultural areas, but also a predator of insect pests. While breeding, it is not social, as its nests are dispersed. It forms flocks when not breeding, although it associates with other bird species infrequently. In some parts of its range, the russet sparrow migrates, at least to lower altitudes. Its nest {{is located in a}} tree cavity, or a hole in a cliff or building. The male chooses the nest site before finding a mate and uses the nest for courtship display. The typical clutch contains five or six whitish eggs. Both sexes incubate and feed the young.|$|E

Analysis of hgw mutant phenotypes indicate that the hemizygous hgw mutation decreases latitudinal cell number in the lemma and palea, both composing the spikelet hull that is known to determine {{the size and shape}} of brown <b>grain.</b> Molecular cloning <b>and</b> characterization of the HGW gene showed that it encodes a novel plant-specific ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain protein localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and functions as a key upstream regulator to promote expressions of heading date- <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> weight-related genes. Moreover, co-expression analysis in rice and Arabidopsis indicated that HGW and its Arabidopsis homolog are co-expressed with genes encoding various components of ubiquitination machinery, implying a fundamental role for the ubiquitination pathway in heading date <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> weight control...|$|R
