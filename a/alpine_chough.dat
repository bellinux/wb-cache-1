5|$|The <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> has two extant subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed chough is {{unlikely}} to be confused with any other species of bird. Although the jackdaw and <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> share its range, the jackdaw is smaller and has unglossed grey plumage, and the <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> has a short yellow bill. Even in flight, the two choughs can be distinguished by Alpine's less rectangular wings, and longer, less square-ended tail.|$|E
5|$|Both species lay 3–5 {{normally}} whitish eggs blotched {{with brown}} or grey, which are incubated by the female alone. The chicks hatch after {{two to three}} weeks. Red-billed chough chicks are almost naked, but the chicks of the higher altitude <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> hatch with a dense covering of natal down. The chicks are fed by both parents and fledge in 29–31 days after hatching for <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough,</b> and 31–41days for red-billed.|$|E

50|$|The {{varieties}} of birds {{of the range}} include griffons, Egyptian vultures, golden eagles, and bearded vultures, <b>Alpine</b> <b>choughs,</b> wood pigeons and black woodpeckers.|$|R
50|$|The {{combination}} of alms and rugged rocky terrain {{is not only}} unique in the German Alpine region, but also offers habitats for several species of animal, such as chamois, <b>Alpine</b> marmots, <b>Alpine</b> <b>choughs,</b> <b>Alpine</b> salamanders, adders, golden eagles and many species of marten.|$|R
5|$|In {{the western}} Italian Alps, the <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> nests {{in a greater}} variety of sites than red-billed chough, using natural cliffs, pot-holes and {{abandoned}} buildings, whereas the red-billed uses only natural cliffs (although it nests in old buildings elsewhere). The <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> lays its eggs about one month later than its relative, although breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The similarities between the two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental constraints on breeding behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The {{rippling}} preep and whistled sweeeooo {{calls of}} the <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> {{are quite different}} from the more typically crow-like chee-ow vocalisations of the jackdaw and the red-billed chough. It also has a rolling churr alarm call, and a variety of quiet warbles and squeaks given by resting or feeding birds. In a study of chough calls throughout the Palearctic region it was found that call frequencies in the <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> showed an inverse relationship between body size and frequency, being higher-pitched in smaller-bodied populations.|$|E
5|$|Where the two chough species occur together, {{there is}} only limited {{competition}} for food. An Italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the red-billed chough was almost exclusively Gagea bulbs, whilst the <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> took berries and hips. In June, red-billed choughs fed on Lepidoptera larvae whereas Alpine choughs ate cranefly pupae. Later in the summer, the <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> mainly consumed grasshoppers, whilst the red-billed chough added cranefly pupae, fly larvae and beetles to its diet. Both choughs will hide food in cracks and fissures, concealing the cache with a few pebbles.|$|E
500|$|<b>Alpine</b> <b>choughs</b> {{have been}} {{observed}} diving at a Tibetan red fox. It seems likely that this [...] "mobbing" [...] behaviour may be play activity to give practice for when genuine defensive measures {{may be needed to}} protect eggs or young.|$|R
500|$|Plant {{matter is}} also eaten, and red-billed chough will take fallen grain where the {{opportunity}} arises; {{it has been}} reported as damaging barley crops by breaking off the ripening heads to extract the corn. <b>Alpine</b> <b>choughs</b> rely more on fruit and berries at times of year when animal prey is limited, and will readily supplement their winter diet with food provided by tourist activities in mountain regions, including ski resorts, refuse dumps and picnic areas. Both Pyrrhocorax species feed in flocks on open areas, often some distance from the breeding cliffs, particularly in winter. Feeding trips may cover [...] distance and [...] in altitude. In the Alps, the development of skiing above [...] has enabled more <b>Alpine</b> <b>choughs</b> to remain at high levels in winter.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} {{identified}} as an IBA by BirdLife International because it supports populations of 162 species of birds, including Himalayan snowcocks, saker falcons, cinereous vultures, solitary snipes, European rollers, <b>Alpine</b> <b>choughs,</b> Hume's short-toed larks, sulphur-bellied warblers, wallcreepers, white-winged snowfinches, brown accentors, water pipits, red-fronted serins, crimson-winged finches, red-mantled rosefinches and white-winged grosbeaks.|$|R
5|$|Giovanni da Udine {{painted in}} Raphael's {{workshop}} in the 16th century. His Mistle Thrush and <b>Alpine</b> <b>Chough</b> was a sketch for his Bird with Garland and Fruit, and {{this in turn}} {{was the basis for}} a Raphael fresco in the Apostolic Palace.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> is {{a host of}} the {{widespread}} bird flea Ceratophyllus vagabunda, two specialist chough fleas Frontopsylla frontalis and F.laetus, a cestode Choanotaenia pirinica, and various species of chewing lice in the genera Brueelia, Menacanthus and Philopterus.|$|E
5|$|Where their ranges overlap, the two chough {{species may}} feed {{together}} in the summer, although there is only limited competition for food. An Italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the red-billed chough was almost exclusively Gagea bulbs, whilst the <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> took berries and hips. In June, red-billed choughs fed mainly on caterpillars whereas Alpine choughs ate cranefly pupae. Later in the summer, the <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> consumed large numbers of grasshoppers, while the red-billed chough added cranefly pupae, fly larvae and beetles to its diet. In the eastern Himalayas in November, Alpine choughs occur mainly in Juniper forests where they feed on juniper berries, differing ecologically from the red-billed choughs in the same region {{and at the same}} time of year, which dig for food in the soil of the villages' terraced pastures.|$|E
40|$|Until quite recently, the {{epistemology}} {{of logical}} laws {{has not been}} much discussed and neither has how one can be justified in claiming that a particular inference is valid. The transfer of warrant from premises to conclusion(s) in modus ponens will be examined in the paper through assessing Paul Boghossian's inferentialist proposal of assuming 'blind reasoning'. It will be argued that merely being justified in inferring according to a logical law a priori is worthless unless one can also be justified in claiming that the inference is valid. An alternative to Boghossian's solution will be presented which addresses this need {{as well as the}} needs Boghossian had identified previously. 1. The Problem: Transmitting Justification in Deductive Reasoning Assume that I want to go on a hike in the Swiss Alps. I'm planning a suitable route and consider the weather; the reports for the area are rather unreliable and I reason: 1) If <b>alpine</b> <b>choughs</b> occur in large groups, the weather in the area will change in the next 2 days. 2) <b>Alpine</b> <b>choughs</b> occur in large groups...|$|R
25|$|The rocks {{around the}} Zugspitze are a habitat for chamois, whilst marmots are {{widespread}} {{on the southern}} side of the massif. At the summit there are frequently <b>alpine</b> <b>choughs,</b> drawn there by people feeding them. Somewhat lower down the mountain there are mountain hare and the hazel dormouse. Alpine birds occurring on the Zugspitze include the golden eagle, rock ptarmigan, snow finch, alpine accentor and brambling. The crag martin which has given {{its name to the}} Schwalbenwand ("Swallows' Wall") at Kreuzeck is frequently encountered. The basins of Mittenwald and Seefeld, as well as the Fern Pass are on bird migration routes.|$|R
50|$|Also goshawk, buzzard, rock partridge, <b>alpine</b> and red-billed <b>chough,</b> {{peregrine}} falcon and sparrow hawk are some important bird species that breed inside the park.|$|R
5|$|As a high {{altitude}} species with limited contact with humans until {{the development of}} mountain tourism activities, the <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> has little cultural significance. It was, however, featured together with its wild mountain habitat in Olivier Messiaen’s Catalogue d'oiseaux ("Bird catalogue"), a piano piece written in 1956–58. Le chocard des alpes ("The Alpine Chough") is the opening piece of Book 1 of the work.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Alpine</b> <b>Chough</b> breeds in {{mountains}} from Spain eastwards through southern Europe and the Alps across Central Asia and the Himalayas {{to western}} China. There are also populations in Morocco, Corsica and Crete. It is a non-migratory resident throughout its range, although Moroccan birds {{have established a}} small colony near Málaga in southern Spain, and wanderers have reached Czechoslovakia, Gibraltar, Hungary and Cyprus.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight of}} the <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> is swift and acrobatic with loose deep wing beats. Its high {{manoeuvrability}} is accomplished by fanning the tail, folding its wings, and soaring in the updraughts at cliff faces. Even in flight, it can be distinguished from the red-billed chough by its less rectangular wings, and longer, less square-ended tail.|$|E
5|$|There {{are more}} than 100 bird species in the park, {{including}} Eurasian eagle-owl, rock ptarmigan, <b>alpine</b> accentor, and <b>chough.</b> Golden eagles nest on rocky ledges, and sometimes in trees. Wallcreeper are found on steep cliffs. There are black woodpeckers and nutcrackers in the park's woodlands.|$|R
50|$|There {{are more}} than 100 bird species in the {{protected}} area. Birds of prey include bearded vulture, golden eagle and Eurasian eagle-owl. Other birds found in the park are black woodpeckers, rock ptarmigans, <b>Alpine</b> accentors, nutcrackers, <b>choughs</b> and black grouses.The wallcreeper is found on steep cliffs especially for nesting.|$|R
5|$|Where their ranges overlap, the two chough {{species may}} feed {{together}} in the summer, although there is only limited competition for food. An Italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the red-billed chough was almost exclusively Gagea bulbs dug from the ground, whilst the <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> took berries and hips. In June, red-billed choughs fed mainly on caterpillars whereas Alpine choughs ate crane fly pupae. Later in the summer, the <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> consumed large numbers of grasshoppers, while the red-billed chough added cranefly pupae, fly larvae and beetles to its diet. In the eastern Himalayas in November, Alpine choughs occur mainly in juniper forests where they feed on juniper berries, differing ecologically from the red-billed choughs in the same region {{and at the same}} time of year, which feed by digging in the soil of terraced pastures of villages.|$|E
5|$|Choughs {{breed in}} mountains, from Morocco and Spain eastwards through {{southern}} Europe and the Alps, across Central Asia and the Himalayas to western China. The <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> {{is also found}} in Corsica and Crete, and the red-billed chough has populations in Ireland, the UK, the Isle of Man, and two areas of the Ethiopian Highlands. Both species are non-migratory residents throughout their range, only occasionally wandering to neighbouring countries.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> , or yellow-billed chough, (Pyrrhocorax graculus) is {{a bird in}} {{the crow}} family, {{one of only two}} species in the genus Pyrrhocorax. Its two {{subspecies}} breed in high mountains from Spain eastwards through southern Europe and North Africa to Central Asia and Nepal, and it may nest at a higher altitude than any other bird. The eggs have adaptations to the thin atmosphere that improve oxygen take-up and reduce water loss.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> lays its eggs {{about one}} month later than its relative, {{although}} breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The similarities between the two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental constraints on breeding behaviour. The first-year survival rate of the juvenile red-billed chough is 72.5 percent, and for the Alpine it is 77%. The annual adult survival rate is 83–92% for Alpine, but is unknown for red-billed.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed chough's loud, ringing chee-ow call {{is similar}} in {{character}} {{to that of other}} corvids, particularly the jackdaw, although it is clearer and louder than the call of that species. In contrast, the <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> has rippling preep and whistled sweeeooo calls quite unlike the crows. Small subspecies of both choughs have higher frequency calls than larger races, as predicted by the inverse relationship between body size and frequency.|$|E
5|$|Both choughs {{occupied}} {{more extensive}} ranges in the past, reaching to more southerly and lower altitude areas than at present, with the <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> breeding in Europe {{as far south}} as southern Italy, and both the decline and range fragmentation continue. Red-billed choughs have lost ground in most of Europe, and Alpine choughs have lost many breeding sites in the east of the continent. In the Canary Islands, the red-billed chough is now extinct on two of the islands on which it formerly bred, and the Alpine was lost from the archipelago altogether.|$|E
5|$|Choughs can be locally {{threatened}} by the accumulation of pesticides and heavy metals in the mountain soils, heavy rain, shooting and other human disturbances, but a longer-term threat comes from global warming, which would cause the species' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely. Fossils of both chough species {{were found in the}} mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.|$|E
5|$|In Spain, the red-billed chough has {{recently}} expanded its range by utilising old buildings, with 1,175 breeding pairs in a mi) study area. These new breeding areas usually surround the original montane core areas. However, the populations with nest sites on buildings {{are threatened by}} human disturbance, persecution {{and the loss of}} old buildings. Fossils of both chough species were found in the mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> has an {{extensive}} though sometimes fragmented range, estimated at 1–10millionsquare kilometres (0.4–3.8million sq mi), {{and a large}} population, including an estimated 260,000 to 620,000 individuals in Europe. The Corsican population has been estimated to comprise about 2,500 birds. Over its range as a whole, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the global population decline criteria of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} from the Pleistocene of Europe {{includes}} a form {{similar to the}} <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough,</b> and sometimes categorised as an extinct subspecies of that bird, and a prehistoric form of the red-billed chough, P. p. primigenius. There are eight generally recognised extant subspecies of red-billed chough, and two of Alpine, although all differ only slightly from the nominate forms. The greater subspecies diversity in the red-billed species arises from an early divergence of the Asian and geographically isolated Ethiopian races from the western forms.|$|E
5|$|This bird has glossy black plumage, {{a yellow}} beak, red legs, and {{distinctive}} calls. It has a buoyant acrobatic flight with widely spread flight feathers. The <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> pairs {{for life and}} displays fidelity to its breeding site, which is usually a cave or crevice in a cliff face. It builds a lined stick nest and lays three to five brown-blotched whitish eggs. It feeds, usually in flocks, on short grazed grassland, taking mainly invertebrate prey in summer and fruit in winter; it will readily approach tourist sites to find supplementary food.|$|E
5|$|In the summer, the <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> feeds {{mainly on}} {{invertebrates}} collected from pasture, such as beetles (Selatosomus aeneus and Otiorhynchus morio {{have been recorded}} from pellets), snails, grasshoppers, caterpillars and fly larvae. The diet in autumn, winter and early spring becomes mainly fruit, including berries such as the European Hackberry (Celtis australis) and Sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), rose hips, and domesticated crops such as apples, grapes and pears where available. It has been observed eating flowers of Crocus vernus albiflorus, including the pistils, perhaps {{as a source of}} carotenoids. The chough will readily supplement its winter diet with food provided by tourist activities in mountain regions, including ski resorts, refuse dumps and picnic areas. Where additional food is available, winter flocks are larger and contain a high proportion of immature birds. The young birds principally frequent the sites with the greatest food availability, such as refuse dumps. Both chough species will hide food in cracks and fissures, concealing the cache with a few pebbles.|$|E
5|$|At the {{greatest}} {{extent of the}} last glacial period around 18,000 years ago, southern Europe was characterised by cold open habitats, and the <b>Alpine</b> <b>chough</b> was found as far as south as southern Italy, well outside its current range. Some of these peripheral prehistoric populations persisted until recently, only to disappear within {{the last couple of}} centuries. In the Polish Tatra Mountains, where a population had survived since the glacial period, it was not found as a breeding bird after the 19th century. In Bulgaria, the number of breeding sites fell from 77 between 1950 and 1981 to just 14 in the 1996 to 2006 period, and the number of pairs in the remaining colonies were much smaller. The decline was thought to be due to the loss of former open grasslands which had reverted to scrubby vegetation once extensive cattle grazing ceased. Foraging habitat can also be lost to human activities such as the construction of ski resorts and other tourist development on former alpine meadows. Populations of choughs are stable or increasing in areas where traditional pastoral or other low intensity agriculture persists, but are declining or have become locally extinct where intensive farming methods have been introduced, such as Brittany, England, south-west Portugal and mainland Scotland.|$|E
