I'm sorry. Sorry, sir.' So I ask him another question, he looks <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> I said, 'You're done, get out of here." [...] Millen said he then told Russell to go to see head coach Rod Marinelli, who later also told Russell to leave his office. [...] "So I'm done, I can't believe what I just witnessed, and so I call Al," [...] Millen said, [...] "I get on the phone and I say, 'Coach, I don't know what you're thinking, but don't take JaMarcus Russell. Don't take Calvin Johnson, but don't take JaMarcus Russell." ...|$|E
60|$|Canon Spratte looked <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> {{gave her}} a reassuring smile.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he glanced}} <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> up at Mr. Wrenn impatiently.|$|E
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> again, <b>and</b> {{the world}} grew black. It was twelve minutes after ten.|$|R
60|$|They waited, Jimmy quietly glancing <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> now <b>and</b> then; {{and at last}} Moran {{stretched}} out a pointing hand.|$|R
6000|$|... 'O, only looking <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> sometimes, <b>and</b> humming tunes, {{and playing}} rat-a-tat-tat upon the table. He says he don't mind waiting a bit.' ...|$|R
60|$|The Baron looked <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> gave a {{guttural}} exclamation of disappointment.|$|E
60|$|Left by himself, Crayford looked <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> <b>and</b> {{called to}} a sailor outside.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bashwood looked <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> <b>and</b> hurriedly {{took his}} hat from a side-table.|$|E
6000|$|Midmore looked <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> again <b>and</b> {{found himself}} saying with no good grace: 'Well, I suppose she'd better have it--for the present at any rate.' ...|$|R
60|$|Awoke to find Jonas {{standing}} <b>at</b> <b>his</b> bedside <b>watching</b> him. <b>And</b> {{that very}} door wide open.|$|R
60|$|Derek drew <b>at</b> <b>his</b> cigar, <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> {{the smoke}} as it curled to the ceiling.|$|R
60|$|Her husband looked <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> <b>and</b> {{then held}} {{it with the}} face toward her.|$|E
60|$|The Major looked <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> <b>and</b> rose--with fluent {{apologies for}} {{abruptly}} leaving the table.|$|E
60|$|The Prince glanced <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> <b>and</b> then at {{the bridge}} tables ready set out.|$|E
60|$|Sir Timothy glanced {{presently}} <b>at</b> <b>his</b> thin gold <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> {{put it back}} in {{his pocket}} regretfully.|$|R
60|$|Carefully and slowly, with {{trembling}} fingers, Deacon {{counted the}} cards he had taken. There were twenty-five. He {{reached over to}} the corner of the table, took up the rules Grief had written, folded them, and put them in his pocket. Then he emptied his glass, and stood up. Captain Donovan looked <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> yawned, <b>and</b> also arose.|$|R
60|$|She {{meant it}} too. I know {{the signs of}} anger in a woman's face {{as well as most}} men, and they were written there plainly enough. So for a most uncomfortable period of time we waited there until Allan, after a glance <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> went <b>and</b> opened the door. She passed out without remark, but from the {{threshold}} outside she turned and looked at me.|$|R
60|$|Wemmick, having {{finished}} his breakfast, here looked <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> <b>and</b> {{began to get}} his coat on.|$|E
60|$|Wingate's nerves {{were all}} on edge. He glanced <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> rose regretfully to his feet.|$|E
60|$|James deigned no answer, looked <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> <b>and</b> {{found it}} time {{to return to the}} school.|$|E
60|$|CAPT. G. (Pulling <b>at</b> <b>his</b> {{moustache}} <b>and</b> <b>watching</b> it sideways {{down his}} nose.) Ha--Hamm. (Aside.) 'Wonder what the little beast can talk about. 'Must make {{a shot at}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} she is married to my cousin," [...] said Will Ladislaw, sauntering down the hall with a preoccupied air, while his German friend kept <b>at</b> <b>his</b> side <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> him eagerly.|$|R
6000|$|When {{the ladies}} came downstairs they found their host and Erskine {{in the picture}} gallery, famous in the {{neighborhood}} for the sum it had cost Sir Charles. There was a new etching to be admired, and they were called on to observe what the baronet called its tones, and what Agatha would have called its degrees of smudginess. Sir Charles's attention often wandered from this work of art. He looked <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> twice, <b>and</b> said to his wife: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{stood for}} a moment on the pavement. Then he glanced <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> hailed a cab.|$|E
60|$|The Professor, who was comfortably {{seated in}} Quest's {{favourite}} easy-chair, glanced <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> shook his head.|$|E
60|$|Sir Lothian Hume {{had been}} looking impatiently <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> <b>and</b> now he shut it with a triumphant snap.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And now,' said Daniel, looking <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> 'as time <b>and</b> tide {{wait for}} no man, my trusty partner, and as I am ready for starting, bag and baggage, {{at the gate}} below, let me say a last word. I want you to grant a request of mine.' ...|$|R
60|$|And {{thus the}} forenoon passes away. Now it is twelve o'clock. The master looks <b>at</b> <b>his</b> great silver <b>watch,</b> <b>and</b> then, with {{tiresome}} deliberation, puts the ferule into his desk. The little multitude await {{the word of}} dismissal with almost irrepressible impatience.|$|R
50|$|Actually Mystique had duped Shepard, and had communicated {{a plan to}} Fantomex on a sub-aural {{level that}} he could hear but others could not - by {{morphing}} her vocal cords. She and Fantomex grabbed Shepard and Fantomex revealed that Shepard was in fact Prudence's brother, who had joined hIS sister, who now inhabited the body of Steinbeck and had taken on the Quiet Man identity. Mystique chopped off Shepard's hand to get <b>at</b> <b>his</b> teleporter <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> went to deal with The Quiet Man.|$|R
60|$|At last, when Harding {{felt the}} tension {{becoming}} unendurable, Clarke glanced <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> reopened the small bottle.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, {{have they}} done now?' replied the Doctor, looking <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> <b>and</b> {{clapping}} his hands. 'Come! make haste! where's Clemency?' ...|$|E
60|$|Felix laughed softly; {{his face}} was full of admiration. He looked <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> <b>and</b> began to gather {{together}} his belongings.|$|E
60|$|How strangely silent {{the place}} seemed! Not a {{footstep}} {{to be heard}} or {{the sound of a}} human voice. He looked <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> again, <b>and</b> saw that it was six o'clock, not five, or so the thing said. But that was impossible, for the Museum shut at five; evidently the desert sand had got into the works. The room in which he stood was that known as Room I, and he had noticed that its Arab custodian often frequented Room K or the gallery outside. He would find him and ask what was the real time.|$|R
60|$|Jarwin, therefore, essayed to {{quit his}} abode, but {{was stopped by}} the taciturn savage, {{who said that he}} must {{consider}} himself a prisoner until the palaver had come to an end. He was therefore fain to content himself with standing <b>at</b> <b>his</b> door <b>and</b> <b>watching</b> the gesticulations of the members of council.|$|R
60|$|Everything was wonderfully simplified. If only {{he could}} get across, once reach New York! Meanwhile, he looked <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> again <b>and</b> {{discovered}} that it wanted but ten minutes to three. He {{made his way back}} down to his stateroom, which was already filled with his luggage. He shook out an ulster from a bundle of wraps, and selected a tweed cap. Already there was a faint touch of the sea in the river breeze, and he was impatient for the immeasurable open spaces, the salt wind, {{the rise and fall of}} the great ship. Then, as he stood on the threshold of his cabin, he heard voices.|$|R
