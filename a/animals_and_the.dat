5|$|Hunting is {{permitted}} {{in most of}} Black Moshannon State Park. It helps to prevent an overpopulation of <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> resulting overbrowsing of the understory. The most common game species are ruffed grouse, eastern gray squirrel, wild turkey, and white-tailed deer. However, the hunting of groundhogs is prohibited.|$|E

5|$|The German {{psychologist}} Adolf Zeising (1810–1876) {{claimed that}} the golden ratio was expressed in the arrangement of plant parts, in the skeletons of <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> branching patterns of their veins and nerves, {{as well as in}} the geometry of crystals.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} {{agriculture}} records the domestication of plants and <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> development and dissemination of techniques for raising them productively.

5|$|Although Herrerasaurus {{shared the}} body {{shape of the}} large {{carnivorous}} dinosaurs, it lived {{during a time when}} dinosaurs were small and insignificant. It was the time of non-dinosaurian reptiles, not dinosaurs, and a major turning point in the Earth's ecology. The vertebrate fauna of the Ischigualasto Formation and the slightly later Los Colorados Formation consisted mainly of a variety of crurotarsal archosaurs and synapsids. In the Ischigualasto Formation, dinosaurs constituted only about 6% {{of the total number of}} fossils, but by the end of the Triassic Period, dinosaurs were becoming the dominant large land <b>animals,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other archosaurs and synapsids declined in variety and number.|$|E

5|$|Before being {{acquired}} by the society, the Corstorphine hill site was a nursery, once owned by Thomas Blaikie, who planted many of the great French parks such as ‘La Bagatelle’. On this site two nurserymen raised the famous apple cultivars ‘John Downie’ and ‘James Grieve’. Today, the zoo {{has one of the}} most diverse tree collections in the Lothians with 120 species. The south-facing aspect allows bananas to be grown outside. Increasingly, horticulture is seen as a discipline in its own right, with the focus on habitat creation within enclosures, food stuffs for the animals, and enrichment for both the <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> visiting public.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is the {{concealment}} {{of animals}} or objects of military interest by {{any combination of}} methods that helps them to remain unnoticed. This includes the use of high-contrast disruptive patterns as used on military uniforms, but anything that delays recognition {{can be used as}} camouflage. Camouflage involves deception, whether by looking like the background or by resembling something else, which may be plainly visible to observers. This article lists methods used by <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> military to escape notice.|$|E
5|$|During 2004, some {{leaders of}} the White Stag Academy {{organized}} a comparable program for the Girl Scouts of California's Central Coast. The program teaches the eleven leadership skills used by White Stag. It was held at Cutter Scout Reservation {{for two years and}} is currently held at Boulder Creek Scout Reservation in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The Girl Scouts assumed leadership of the program after 2006 and renamed it Camp Artemis, after the Greek goddess who protects young girls, <b>animals,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> natural environment. The Youth Staff are referred to as members of ALTA (Artemis Leadership Training Adventure). They have continued to run Camp Artemis as a resident camp for girls 11 – 17 each summer.|$|E

Known at different times as the Minneapolis Humane Society, the Animal Rescue League, and the Animal Humane Society of Hennepin County, today's Animal Humane Society (AHS) was located there near Loring Park for 40 years.

5|$|Garner {{has also}} criticised Cochrane's {{rejection}} of liberty rights for animals; others to challenge this include Hadley and the philosophers Andreas T. Schmidt, Valéry Giroux, and Jason Wyckoff. Cochrane has developed his account in subsequent work, tying {{his work to}} cosmopolitan theory in a 2013 paper and developing an account of labour rights for animals in a 2016 paper. As of 2016, Cochrane {{is working on a}} book on the topic of animal rights and global justice, covering questions of cross-border obligations to nonhuman <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> idea of international politics taking the rights of all sentient beings seriously. The book is intended for 2017 or 2018 release.|$|E
5|$|Nazi {{society had}} {{elements}} supportive of animal rights {{and many people}} were fond of zoos and wildlife. The government took several measures to ensure the protection of <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> environment. In 1933, the Nazis enacted a stringent animal-protection law that affected what was allowed for medical research. However, the law was only loosely enforced {{and in spite of}} a ban on vivisection the Ministry of the Interior readily handed out permits for experiments on animals.|$|E

5|$|Pink Floyd {{achieved}} international {{success with}} the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, <b>Animals,</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Wall. By the early 1980s, they {{had become one of}} the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful groups in the history of popular music; by 2013, they had sold more than 250 million albums worldwide. Amid creative differences, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute with the remaining members over their use of the band's name and material. They settled out of court in 1987, and nearly eighteen years passed before he performed with them again.|$|E
5|$|Production of {{the film}} began in January 2006. Several visual effect {{companies}} were used to provide CGI for the numerous <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> climactic flood scene. The main plot is a modern-day retelling of Noah's Ark. By the time the film had completed production, it had become the most expensive comedy film ever at the time; it was later overtaken by Men in Black 3. In October 2007, the film was released on DVD and HD DVD.|$|E

5|$|The calcium {{carbonate}} or silica spicules of most sponge genera make them too rough for most uses, but two genera, Hippospongia and Spongia, have soft, entirely fibrous skeletons. Early Europeans used soft sponges for many purposes, including padding for helmets, portable drinking utensils and municipal water filters. Until {{the invention of}} synthetic sponges, they were used as cleaning tools, applicators for paints and ceramic glazes and discreet contraceptives. However, by the mid-20th century, over-fishing brought both the <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> industry close to extinction.|$|E
5|$|The giraffe (Giraffa) is a genus of African even-toed {{ungulate}} mammals, the tallest living terrestrial <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> largest ruminants.

Taxonomic classifications {{of one to}} eight extant giraffe species have been described, based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements of Giraffa, but the IUCN currently recognizes only one species with nine subspecies.|$|E
