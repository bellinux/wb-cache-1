25|$|The doctor {{warned me}} – {{and so did}} members of my family soon {{afterward}} – that if I did not keep my epilepsy a secret, people would fear me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> subject to discrimination. Even now, seven years after that scene in the dining hall, {{it is difficult for}} me to say that I have epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the years since, I have had hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out were my real concern.|$|E
25|$|The Cheyennes do {{not fight}} {{at all this}} side of the Arkansas; they do not trouble Texas, but north of the Arkansas they are almost always at war. When lately north of the Arkansas, some young Cheyennes were fired upon and then the fight began. I have always done my best to keep my young men quiet, but some will not listen, and since the {{fighting}} began I {{have not been able to}} keep them all at home. But we all want peace, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> glad to move all my people down this way; I could then keep them all quietly near camp. My camp is now on the Washita, 40 miles east of the Antelope Hills, and I have there about 180 lodges. I speak only for my own people; I cannot speak nor control the Cheyennes north of the Arkansas.|$|E

500|$|Recording of {{the song}} started in September 1990 at Bearsville Studio A in Woodstock, New York. The song was {{arranged}} {{in the studio with}} mandolin, electric bass, and drums. Bassist Mike Mills came up with a bassline inspired by the work of Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie; by his own admission he could not come up with one for the song that was not derivative. Buck said the arrangement {{of the song}} [...] "had a hollow feel to it. There's absolutely no midrange on it, just low end and high end, because Mike usually stayed pretty low on the bass." [...] The band decided to have touring guitarist Peter Holsapple play acoustic guitar on the recording. Buck reflected, [...] "It was really cool: Peter <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in our little booth, sweating away, and Bill and Mike would be out there in the other room going at it. It just had a really magical feel." [...] Singer Michael Stipe's vocal was recorded in a single take. Orchestral strings, arranged by Mark Bingham, were added to the song by members of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra at Soundscape Studios in Atlanta, Georgia in October 1990.|$|E

2500|$|According to Gomez, one of {{the main}} inspirations behind the track was the body-shaming she dealt with from tabloids and social media, after photos {{surfaced}} online of the singer in a bikini during a trip to Mexico in April 2015. [...] Many claimed she gained weight, with some news outlets going as far as to label her a [...] "mess", and suggested Gomez was [...] "going off the deep end". She commented: [...] "I was getting a lot of hate for my body and ‘you’re gaining weight,’ and so I was in Mexico and I was just feeling all of this stuff <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> lying to you if I said it didn’t kind of hurt my feelings, but I kind of channeled that into my music."

In 2010, he explained that for him [...] "Ferrari has always been the number one car" [...] to own and drive, and that he always supported Ferrari on the road and in Formula One motor racing.

After the third series, James Corden stated: 'As far as [...] "specials" [...] are concerned, I think if we had an idea for a story with these characters then maybe, but I don't think that'll happen any time soon.' In January 2010, Larry Lamb predicted a future Christmas [...] "special", stating 'Clearly the audience loves it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very surprised if it did not come back for a Christmas episode.'

2500|$|McConnell {{is named}} by Weir {{to have been}} {{involved}} in a gun and bomb attack against a pub in Crossmaglen in November 1974, resulting in the fatal injury of Thomas McNamee. Weir also alleged {{that he was one of}} the accomplices in the killing of high-ranking IRA member John Francis Green outside Castleblaney in the Irish Republic on 10 January 1975. Green was shot six times in the head at close range by a group of gunmen who had burst through the front door of the [...] "safe" [...] house where he was staying; the UVF later claimed responsibility for the attack in the June 1975 edition of their journal Combat.

2500|$|In 1997 {{the band}} {{recorded}} Musical Monkey, an album which captured their chaotic energy and sharp sense of humor. It {{is considered by}} many to be the best representation of their [...] "classic" [...] sound, and songs such as [...] "Lucky the Donkey," [...] "Do the Hustle," [...] "Lipstick" [...] and [...] "Perfect World" [...] became staples in their live set. The following year they released Live From the Pharmacy, a recording of a live show from 1994 that also included four new songs engineered by Vandals guitarist Warren Fitzgerald and liner notes written by Nunn recounting the band’s history. In 1998 Guttermouth was banned from performing in Canada for one year on charges of public indecency after Adkins exposed himself onstage in Saskatoon. According to Adkins: [...] "oh, I was guilty [...] What I would do is grab two young girls out of the audience and I would have them hold up this sheet in front of me, and Jamie, the drummer at the time, would say this magical incantation, if you will, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> standing there stark naked." [...] Combined with a drunk driving charge from the United States, the incident led Adkins to be arrested on immigration charges, detained for five days, and then deported, though Guttermouth would return to Canada a few years later. After obtaining a full pardon from the Canadian judicial system known as the crown. No record remains on file.|$|E
2500|$|Stuart's career {{advanced}} when English director James Whale chose her for {{the glamour}} role as a sentimental wife who winds up stranded among strangers at a spooky mansion in his ensemble cast (Boris Karloff, Melvyn Douglas, Charles Laughton, Lilian Bond, Ernest Thesiger, Eva Moore and Raymond Massey) for The Old Dark House (1932). The film was critically praised, and The New York Times called Stuart's performance [...] "clever and charming," [...] with the movie later becoming a cult classic. Stuart's experience filming The Old Dark House also became integral {{to the formation of}} the Screen Actors Guild in 1933: [...] "James [...] joined all the English actors,” Stuart recalled. “So {{on one side of the}} set they had their ‘elevensies’ and `foursies,’ and Melvyn [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> sitting together, not invited. One day, Melvyn said to me, `Are you interested in forming a union together?’ I said, ‘What’s a union?’ He said, ‘Like in New York – Actor’s Equity. The actors get together and work for better working conditions.’ I said, ‘Oh wonderful,’ because I was getting up at five every morning; in makeup at seven, in hair at eight, wardrobe at quarter of nine, and then sometimes if production wanted you to, you worked until four or five the next morning. There was no overtime. They fed us when they felt like it, when it was convenient for production. It was really very, very hard work." [...] After filming completed, Stuart began canvassing, and was one of the union's first founding members.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{cast and}} crew members warned the {{audience}} of the graphic content of the episode. Prior to the episode's release, certain scenes {{were reported to have}} been cut from the official broadcast, having been deemed too disturbing. The scenes remaining in the episode have been met with comparable observations by the show's actors. Steven Yeun, who portrays Glenn Rhee, said: I remember a couple of scenes I would look over at {{what was going on in}} the scene <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> like, ‘What the eff?

It would not work on network television, let me tell you that. Lauren Cohan, who portrays Maggie Greene, made similar comments regarding the episode, saying some of the scenes were [...] "so disturbing", she did not think they would make it on TV. The series' composer, Bear McCreary, tweeted to parents of young children: [...] "Do not let children watch The Walking Dead tonight. Or ever again.

Despite his warning, McCreary said that [...] "No Sanctuary" [...] was his [...] "favorite episode in years, and, , the scariest score I've ever done." [...] Series creator and executive producer Robert Kirkman stated that the episode's opening presented to the audience the threat that the characters face, although he said, [...] " [...] actually adds a tremendous amount of value to the story, and so that’s what justifies these great lengths that we go to to, you know, disgust the audience." [...] Gimple said that there was concern of the graphic nature of the episode, but both he and the network eventually felt it was necessary for the episode's plot, and that it contained meaning within the story. He also stated that the disturbing acts of the people in Terminus was important to convey the terror of [...] "institutional evil", saying: ...|$|E
