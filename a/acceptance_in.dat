5|$|Finally, Burton {{argued that}} the Eastern District of Missouri was an unconstitutional venue and vicinage (an {{argument}} that the Court had accepted in Burton I).

The Court held that the agreement had occurred in St. Louis (as the jury had been instructed that it was required to find) based on Rialto's <b>acceptance</b> <b>in</b> St. Louis, the telegram, and the letter. The Court bolstered this view by citation to its own and other precedents concerning offer and <b>acceptance</b> <b>in</b> contract law. The Court further cited its earlier precedents holding that the venue provision of Article III {{does not require the}} physical presence of the defendant in the forum state.|$|E

An Englishman Colebrooke later translated into English the section on inheritance giving it currency in the British Indian court system.

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, African-American workers gained greater <b>acceptance</b> <b>in</b> industry than previously, but discrimination remained a problem for many black workers. During the war, city officials passed the first municipal integration ordinance, allowing African Americans to eat at city-owned (but not private) lunch counters. In May 1944, when a black sailor in uniform was refused service at a privately owned lunch counter, the action prompted peaceful sit-in protests at several downtown diners. No changes in Jim Crow segregation policies at lunch counters resulted, but Saint Louis University admitted its first black students starting in August 1944.|$|E

5|$|Objections to {{evolution}} {{have been}} raised since evolutionary ideas came to prominence in the 19th century. When Charles Darwin published his 1859 book On the Origin of Species, his theory of evolution (the idea that species arose through descent with modification from a single common ancestor in a process driven by natural selection) initially met opposition from scientists with different theories, but eventually came to receive overwhelming <b>acceptance</b> <b>in</b> the scientific community. The observation of evolutionary processes occurring (as well as the modern evolutionary synthesis explaining that evidence) has been uncontroversial among mainstream biologists since the 1940s.|$|E

40|$|Objectives The aims of {{this study}} were: (1) {{investigate}} relations between pain acceptance, depressive symptoms, catastrophizing, and functional disability in pediatric patients in an interdisciplinary chronic pain rehabilitation program, (2) examine changes <b>in</b> <b>acceptance</b> from pre- to posttreatment, and (3) test if changes <b>in</b> <b>acceptance</b> predict changes <b>in</b> depressive symptoms, catastrophizing, and functional disability from pre-to posttreatment. Methods 112 participants, ages 11 – 18 years, completed the Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire, Adolescent Version, Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression-Children’s Scale, Pain Catastrophizing Scale for Children, and Functional Disability Inventory on admission to and completion of the program. Results Significant and strong relations between acceptance, depression, catastrophizing, and functional disability were demonstrated. Participants demonstrated significant increases <b>in</b> <b>acceptance</b> and de-creases <b>in</b> depression, catastrophizing, and functional disability. Finally, changes <b>in</b> <b>acceptance</b> significantly predicted changes in depressive symptoms, catastrophizing, and functional disability. Conclusions Pain acceptance is an important variable {{in the treatment of}} pediatric chronic pain. Key words acceptance; chronic pain; functional disability; rehabilitation...|$|R
5|$|Bernstein {{states that}} Washington's lynching {{was a unique}} event because it {{occurred}} {{in a city with}} a reputation for progressiveness, but was attended by thousands of people who were excited by the brutal torture. Similar acts of mob violence typically occurred in smaller towns with fewer spectators. William Carrigan of Rowan University argues that the culture of central Texas had glorified retributive mob violence for decades before Washington's lynching, maintaining that this culture of violence explains how such a brutal attack could be publicly celebrated. Hale posits that Washington's death signaled a transition in the practice of lynching, demonstrating its <b>acceptance</b> <b>in</b> modernized, 20th-century cities. She notes that Washington's lynching illustrates how technological innovations, such as telephones and inexpensive photographs, could empower lynch mobs but also increase society's condemnation of their actions.|$|E
5|$|Birth control {{practices}} were generally adopted earlier in Europe {{than in the}} United States. Knowlton's book was reprinted in 1877 in England by Charles Bradlaugh and Annie Besant, {{with the goal of}} challenging Britain's obscenity laws. They were arrested (and later acquitted) but the publicity of their trial contributed to the formation, in 1877, of the Malthusian League– the world's first birth control advocacy group– which sought to limit population growth to avoid Thomas Malthus's dire predictions of exponential population growth leading to worldwide poverty and famine. By 1930, similar societies had been established in nearly all European countries, and birth control began to find <b>acceptance</b> <b>in</b> most Western European countries, except Catholic Ireland, Spain, and France. As the birth control societies spread across Europe, so did birth control clinics. The first birth control clinic in the world was established in the Netherlands in 1882, run by the Netherlands' first female physician, Aletta Jacobs. The first birth control clinic in England was established in 1921 by Marie Stopes, in London.|$|E
5|$|From the onset, {{parent company}} General Motors was {{interested}} in incorporating a left-hand drive Commodore in its Buick lineup, as manifested by the unveiling of the Buick XP2000 concept car in 1996. Although this idea was ultimately abandoned (due to pressures by the North American automotive trade unions to retain local production), the GM-funded project allowed Holden {{to enter into a}} range of left-hand export markets. Thus began the Commodore's rapid expansion into parts of Indochina, the Middle East and South Africa badged as the Chevrolet Lumina and Brazil as the Chevrolet Omega 3.8 V6. In its home market, the VT series was awarded the 1997 Wheels Car of the Year award, the fourth such award in Commodore's history. It found ready <b>acceptance</b> <b>in</b> the market as many buyers steered away from the slow selling Ford AU Falcon, becoming the best selling Commodore to date and cementing its place as number one in Australian sales.|$|E

5|$|Holden's {{most popular}} car to date, the Commodore, was {{introduced}} in 1978 as the VB. The new family car was loosely based on the Opel Rekord E body shell, but with the front from the Opel Senator grafted to accommodate the larger Holden six-cylinder and V8 engines. Initially, the Commodore maintained Holden's sales leadership in Australia. However, some of the compromises resulting from {{the adoption of a}} design intended for another market hampered the car's <b>acceptance.</b> <b>In</b> particular, it was narrower than its predecessor and its Falcon rival, making it less comfortable for three rear-seat passengers. With the abandonment of left-hand drive markets, Holden exported almost 100,000 Commodores to markets such as New Zealand, Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, Malta and Singapore.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Anatoly Nikolaevich Riabinin named Albertosaurus pericolosus {{based on}} a tooth from China, that {{probably}} belonged to Tarbosaurus. In 1932, Friedrich von Huene renamed Dryptosaurus incrassatus, not considered a nomen dubium by him, to Albertosaurus incrassatus. Because he had identified Gorgosaurus with Albertosaurus, in 1970, Russell also renamed Gorgosaurus sternbergi (Matthew & Brown 1922) into Albertosaurus sternbergi and Gorgosaurus lancensis (Gilmore 1946) into Albertosaurus lancensis. The former species is today seen as a juvenile form of Gorgosaurus libratus, the latter as either identical to Tyrannosaurus or representing a separate genus Nanotyrannus. In 1988, Gregory S. Paul based Albertosaurus megagracilis on a small tyrannosaurid skeleton, specimen LACM 28345, from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana. It was renamed Dinotyrannus in 1995, but is now thought to represent a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex. Also in 1988, Paul renamed Alectrosaurus olseni (Gilmore 1933) into Albertosaurus olseni; this has found no general <b>acceptance.</b> <b>In</b> 1989, Gorgosaurus novojilovi (Maleev 1955) was renamed by Bryn Mader and Robert Bradley as Albertosaurus novojilovi; today this {{is seen as a}} synonym of Tarbosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Local {{influences}} {{have also}} been a strong part of Scouting. By adopting and modifying local ideologies, Scouting {{has been able to}} find <b>acceptance</b> <b>in</b> a wide variety of cultures. In the United States, Scouting uses images drawn from the U.S. frontier experience. This includes not only its selection of animal badges for Cub Scouts, but the underlying assumption that American native peoples are more closely connected with nature and therefore have special wilderness survival skills which can be used as part of the training program. By contrast, British Scouting makes use of imagery drawn from the Indian subcontinent, because that region was a significant focus {{in the early years of}} Scouting. Baden-Powell's personal experiences in India led him to adopt Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book as a major influence for the Cub Scouts; for example, the name used for the Cub Scout leader, Akela (whose name was also appropriated for the Webelos), is that of the leader of the wolf pack in the book.|$|E
