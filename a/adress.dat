This feature was dropped in subsequent games because the requirement for master tracks would have restricted the studio's choice of songs. SingStar for PlayStation 3 introduced the ability to digitally suppress vocals, using <b>ADRess</b> (Azimuth Discrimination and Resynthesis) technology developed by Dan Barry at the Audio Research Group, based in the Dublin Institute of Technology. The <b>ADRess</b> settings vary for each track, and the technology is able to successfully remove the vocal tracks from 80% of songs.|$|E

5000|$|Charles-Henri Sanson {{performed}} 2,918 executions, including Louis XVI. Even {{though he}} was not a supporter of the monarchy, he was initially reluctant to execute the king but in the end performed the execution. As David Jordan notes, “No Monsieur de Paris had ever had the honor of executing a king, and Sanson wanted precise instructions.” Sanson experienced the political and psychological pressures of revolutionary Paris. He had the duty to execute Louis XVI under the power of the sitting Provisional Government. Being the heir to a line of executioners, to refuse this duty would have brought shame to the family name and danger to himself and to his family members. He experienced the stress of having to execute not only the king, but successive waves of officials as those in power shifted rapidly in a time of revolutionary change. But the execution of Louis XVI was of particular import. Fearing rescue efforts, the streets of Paris were lined with troops as Louis’s carriage took its somber two hours to travel to the scaffold arriving at 10 am on January 21, 1793. After Sanson efficiently cut his hair, Louis attempted to address the crowd but was silenced with a drum roll and Louis was executed, Sanson pulling his head from the basket to show to the crowd. [...] But the execution may not have gone as smoothly as possible: “One of two accounts of Louis’ death suggest the blade did not sever his whole neck in one go, and had to be borne down on by the executioner to get a clean cut.” Quite possibly, then, the execution went from being quick and fast to being more difficult and painful. As David <b>Adress</b> notes, however, “With his spine severed already, it is nevertheless unlikely that Louis could have uttered the ‘terrible cry’ that one account claims.” ...|$|E
50|$|One of {{the biggest}} Vrkoč‘s success is {{dragging}} {{the general manager of}} a competitive project to his own project. Other collaborators include the project’s main engineer and designer who worked on Queen Mary II., Stephen Payne and Ivan Samák, a former director of Czech shipyard in Chvaletice. Samák figures in the project as a natural person only.Because of the safety reasons, the ship reduction in size and also the fuel consumption, the original coal boilers will be exchanged for modern diesel engines. The exterior was designed the same as the original appearance of Titanic with regard to the safety reasons and the usage of modern technologies. The actual construction of the ship will be made using modern materials, which will be hidden and as a result, some elements will only have the esthetic meaning. The interior was designed based on the original ship as well, and because of safety reasons the second and third class cabins would be partially removed. The first class cabins, dining room, stairs etc., would maintain the same. The project is open to compromise, as mentioned above, in sense of fake rooms which would worked as small museums. There are newly designed two classes: first class remains the same and carries the name Titanic class, the second class will be named FUN TANIC class, replacing the original second and third class.The original plan for investors was to <b>adress</b> wide public, but that was evaluated as unrealistic. Among the investors we include steel magnate who would give us the steel, followed by some major operators of ships. The price of a standard ticket for the weekly cruise is currently estimated at 20 000 CZK. Routes should be placed mainly in the Caribbean, but ship would sail during the annual anniversary along the original route of the Titanic from Southampton to New York. During the anchoring in ports, the ship should be accessible to the public and also to act as a museum. The project manager negotiate with owners about getting the original parts of the Titanic and about the placement these parts to a new Titanic as a symbol of honor to the victims of the tragedy. This could be for instance the angel on the original stairs.|$|E
