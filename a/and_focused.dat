40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the role of}} topic <b>and</b> <b>focus</b> in sentence processing, with particular attention to Hungarian. It is proposed that sentence topic <b>and</b> contrastive <b>focus</b> have a privileged relation to any prior discourse-related phrases, allowing them to influence the processing of the current sentence. The dissertation describes a series of experiments designed to test a distinction in processing of the discourse-related phrases topic <b>and</b> <b>focus</b> on the one hand, and non-discourse-related (background) constituents on the other. I argue that topic <b>and</b> <b>focus</b> receive discourse-interpretation during their initial processing; by contrast, elements in the background (other than inherently discourse-related ones) are incorporated into the discourse only after the entire proposition has been processed. This has important consequences for the types of information used by the parser when processing topic <b>and</b> <b>focus</b> vs. background. In particular, I propose that topic plays a distinguished role in constructing the contrast set for a contrastively focused item. ^ The privileged role of topic <b>and</b> <b>focus</b> is argued to follow from a syntactic property of Hungarian, namely, the structural marking of topic <b>and</b> <b>focus.</b> This allows the parser to identify the discourse-related status of topic <b>and</b> <b>focus</b> {{as soon as they}} are encountered. Immediate discourse interpretation of topic <b>and</b> <b>focus</b> is further related to the possibility of multiple filler-gap dependencies in Hungarian, which raises special issues in processing complexity and memory limitations. I examine some grammatical and parsing principles necessary to interpret simultaneous dependencies between two topics or wh-phrases and their traces. I propose that the parser constructs temporary memory buffers on the spot for each type of A'-dependency (topic, wh-phrase) separately, to help relieve the burden on immediate memory posed by a series of unassigned fillers. ...|$|R
5|$|By the 19th century, Victorian {{scholars}} such as William Stubbs, James Ramsay, and William Hunt {{sought to}} understand how the English political system had evolved under Henry. They explored the emergence of Parliamentary institutions during his reign, and sympathized with the concerns of the chroniclers over the role of the Poitevins in England. This focus carried on into early 20th-century research into Henry, such as Kate Norgate's 1913 volume, which continued to make heavy use of the chronicler accounts <b>and</b> <b>focused</b> primarily on constitutional issues, with a distinctive nationalistic bias.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin's {{loneliness}} {{was relieved}} when he met 21-year-old actress Paulette Goddard in July 1932, and the pair began a successful relationship. He {{was not ready to}} commit to a film, however, <b>and</b> <b>focused</b> on writing a serial about his travels (published in Woman's Home Companion). The trip had been a stimulating experience for Chaplin, including meetings with several prominent thinkers, and he became increasingly interested in world affairs. The state of labour in America troubled him, and he feared that capitalism and machinery in the workplace would increase unemployment levels. It was these concerns that stimulated Chaplin to develop his new film.|$|E
5|$|Editing {{took two}} years; Paul Martin Smith started {{the process in}} England <b>and</b> <b>focused</b> on dialogue-heavy scenes. Ben Burttwho was also the film's sound editorwas {{responsible}} for action sequences under Lucas' supervision. Non-linear editing systems played a large part in translating Lucas' vision; he constantly tweaked, revised and reworked shots and scenes. The final sound mix was added in March 1999 and the following month the film was completed after the delivery of the remaining visual effects shots.|$|E
40|$|Adaptive optics {{systems can}} measure {{high-order}} aberrations using an artificial laser beacon {{without the need}} for a relatively bright object near the object being imaged. Unfortunately, tilt <b>and</b> <b>focus</b> measurements are difficult to obtain from a laser beacon. One solution is to use light from the object being imaged to measure tilt <b>and</b> <b>focus.</b> Through analysis, I estimate the performance of using a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor with 2 by 2 sub-apertures for measuring tilt <b>and</b> <b>focus.</b> Specifically, I discuss implementing this scheme for the sodium beacon adaptive optics upgrade to the Starfire Optical Range (SOR) 3. 5 m telescope. I use wave-optics simulation tools to evaluate the performance of the tilt <b>and</b> <b>focus</b> sensor in the SOR sodium beacon system. 1...|$|R

5|$|Goffman's {{early works}} consist of his {{graduate}} writings of 1949–53. His master's thesis was {{a survey of}} audience responses to a radio soap opera, Big Sister. One of its most important elements was a critique of his research methodology – of experimental logic and of variable analysis. Other writings of the period include Symbols of Class Status (1951) and On Cooling the Mark Out (1952). His doctoral dissertation, Communication Conduct in an Island Community (1953), presented a model of communication strategies in face-to-face interaction, <b>and</b> <b>focused</b> on how everyday life rituals affect public projections of self.|$|E
