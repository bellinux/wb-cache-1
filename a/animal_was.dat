5|$|Finally, it {{is quite}} {{possible}} that the sail or hump combined these functions, acting normally as a heat regulator, becoming a courting aid during the mating season, being used to cool itself and, on occasions, turning into an intimidating device when an <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> feeling threatened.|$|E
5|$|Le Règne <b>Animal</b> <b>was</b> {{influential}} in being widely read, and in presenting accurate descriptions of groups of related animals, {{such as the}} living elephants and the extinct mammoths, providing convincing evidence for evolutionary change to readers including Charles Darwin, although Cuvier himself rejected the possibility of evolution.|$|E

5|$|Basque {{people were}} the first to hunt right whales commercially, {{beginning}} as early as the 11th century in the Bay of Biscay. They initially sought oil, but as meat preservation technology improved, the <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> also used for food. Basque whalers reached eastern Canada by 1530 and the shores of Todos os Santos Bay (in Bahia, Brazil) by 1602. The last Basque voyages were made before the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). All attempts to revive the trade after the war failed. Basque shore whaling continued sporadically into the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles (born April 30, 1983) is {{a common}} chimpanzee, known for being the {{one-time}} companion animal of American recording artist Michael Jackson, who bought the primate from a Texas research facility in the early 1980s. The <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> a frequent travel companion to the singer, whose attachment to the animal led to media mockery and, among other factors, a public perception of Jackson as eccentric. During the Bad world tour, for example, Jackson brought Bubbles with him to Japan, where they both drank tea with the mayor of Osaka.|$|E
5|$|Common {{trees are}} oaks, willows and alders, which {{tolerate}} wet soils. Because the phreatic table {{is very close}} to the surface, soils hardly freeze in winter and drought rarely occurs in summer. The nature reserve also has meadows and reed beds. Common animals include a large variety of birds (storks, curlews, harriers), amphibians and mammals (beavers). The reserve is home to the largest fallow deer population in France. This <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> introduced to the area in 1854.|$|E
30|$|Anaesthetized rats {{underwent}} the sCASP procedure, whereas sham <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> sham operated {{and control}} <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> just monitored invasively. Haemodynamic variables and blood gases were continuously measured. After 24 h, <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> reanesthetized; cardiac output (CO), inulin and PAH clearances were measured {{and later on}} kidneys were harvested; and creatinine, urea, cystatin C and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) were analysed. Additional sCASP-treated <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> investigated after 3 and 9 days.|$|R

30|$|Twenty-four intact male {{yearling}} Washera sheep {{with similar}} body condition and initial body weight of 18.14 [*]± 1.07  kg (mean[*]±[*]SD) were bought {{from a local}} market of Genet Abo town. Age of the <b>animals</b> <b>was</b> determined by dentition and information obtained by the owners. <b>Animals</b> <b>were</b> neck tagged for identification, and were quarantined for 21 days. During this time, <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> dewormed for internal parasites using albendazol and fasinex and sprayed for external parasites using diazinon. Experimental <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> also vaccinated against pasteurollosis and anthrax based on recommendation of a veterinarian. After the quarantine period, <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> housed individually in separate pens.|$|R
5|$|During this episode, {{the dogs}} had to {{interact}} with the main characters, which proved difficult. Actor Sean Bean reported that for the final scene where he has to sacrifice Lady, the <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> too scared to remain still. They had to keep rehearsing the scene until the dog felt comfortable, making a shot that should have taken a few minutes about three hours long.|$|E
5|$|From a {{behavioral}} standpoint, {{one of the}} most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the Gobi Desert in 1971. It included a Velociraptor attacking a Protoceratops, providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other. Additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially healed tail of an Edmontosaurus, a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged {{in such a way that}} shows the <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived. Cannibalism amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in Madagascar in 2003, involving the theropod Majungasaurus.|$|E
5|$|Further work {{to improve}} {{the image of the}} town {{continues}} with the latest Central Basingstoke Vision project coordinated by the Borough Council. In the mid-1990s, numerous reports described sightings of the Beast of Basingstoke, a big cat believed to be a lion or a puma, possibly two. Local legend suggests the <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> shot and killed, although no official news sources document any capture or killing of the beast.|$|E

5|$|Gigantic and {{visually}} impressive, the Megalosaurus {{became one of}} the park's three 'mascot dinosaurs' along with the Iguanodon and (less so) the Ichthyosaurs. Working from fragmentary evidence from Jurassic fossils found in England, consisting mainly of a hip and femur (thigh bone), with a rib and a few vertebrae, Owen conjectured the <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> quadrupedal; palaeontologists now believe it to have been bipedal (standing like Tyrannosaurus rex). The first suggestion that some dinosaurs might have been bipedal came in 1858, just too late to influence the model.|$|E
5|$|Histological {{analysis}} of the lines of arrested growth within the tibiae from the various ontogenetic stages of Limusaurus indicates that the <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> skeletally mature at six years in age. In older specimens, the outermost lines of arrested growth are very close together (forming {{what is known as}} the external fundamental system), indicating that rapid growth had ceased in these particular individuals.|$|E
5|$|Koalas were hunted by {{indigenous}} Australians and {{depicted in}} myths and cave art for millennia. The first recorded encounter between a European and a koala was in 1798, and {{an image of}} the <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> published in 1810 by naturalist George Perry. Botanist Robert Brown wrote the first detailed scientific description of the koala in 1814, although his work remained unpublished for 180 years. Popular artist John Gould illustrated and described the koala, introducing the species to the general British public. Further details about the animal's biology were revealed in the 19th century by several English scientists. Because of its distinctive appearance, the koala is recognised worldwide as a symbol of Australia. Koalas are listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The Australian government similarly lists specific populations in Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable. The <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> hunted heavily in the early 20th century for its fur, and large-scale cullings in Queensland resulted in a public outcry that initiated a movement to protect the species. Sanctuaries were established, and translocation efforts moved to new regions koalas whose habitat had become fragmented or reduced. The biggest threat to their existence is habitat destruction caused by agriculture and urbanisation.|$|E

5|$|Majungasaurus was a {{main focus}} of the fifth episode of the mini-series When Dinosaurs Ruled hosted by Jeff Goldblum. It also {{featured}} in the pilot episode of Jurassic Fight Club, in which its cannibalistic behavior was explored. In both series, the <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> referred to as Majungatholus. It was properly referred to as Majungasaurus in the third episode of BBC's Planet Dinosaur, in which its killing technique {{as well as its}} cannibalistic nature were explored.|$|E
5|$|Marsh {{and then}} Hatcher {{assumed that the}} <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> aquatic, because of the {{position}} of its nasal openings at the apex of the cranium. Similar aquatic behavior was commonly depicted for other large sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. A 1951 study by Kenneth A. Kermack indicates that sauropods probably could not have breathed through their nostrils {{when the rest of the}} body was submerged, as the water pressure on the chest wall would be too great. Since the 1970s, general consensus has the sauropods as firmly terrestrial animals, browsing on trees, ferns, and bushes.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists have {{proposed}} {{many ways in}} which the sail could have functioned in life. Some of the first to think about its purpose suggested that the sail may have served as camouflage among reeds while Dimetrodon waited for prey, or as an actual boat-like sail to catch the wind while the <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> in the water. Another is that the long neural spines could have stabilized the trunk by restricting up-and-down movement, which would allow for a more efficient side-to-side movement while walking.|$|E

[...] When known strains of bacteria or microbiota are introduced to a germ-free <b>animal,</b> it usually <b>is</b> referred to as a gnotobiotic animal, however technically speaking, germ-free <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> also gnotobiotic because the status of their microbial community is known.|$|R
5|$|The {{ancestor}} of Noronhomys {{may have been}} a semiaquatic animal, similar to living Holochilus or Lundomys, that arrived on Fernando de Noronha by chance on a floating log. The morphology of the limb bones in Noronhomys suggests that the <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> not semiaquatic like its relatives, but terrestrial, consistent with its occurrence on a small island, where streams and pools are rare or absent.|$|E
5|$|The <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> {{examined}} by scholars and the curious, and letters describing the fantastic creature {{were sent to}} correspondents throughout Europe. The earliest known image of the animal illustrates a poemetto by Florentine Giovanni Giacomo Penni, published in Rome on 13 July 1515, fewer than eight weeks after its arrival in Lisbon. The only known copy of the original published poem is held by the Institución Colombina in Seville.|$|E
5|$|The current {{president}} is Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, {{who took over}} from Paul Nurse on 30 November 2015. Historically, {{the duties of the}} president have been both formal and social. The Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 left the president {{as one of the few}} individuals capable of certifying that a particular experiment on an <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> justified. In addition, the president is to act as the government's chief (albeit informal) advisor on scientific matters. Yet another task is that of entertaining distinguished foreign guests and scientists.|$|E
50|$|Eating live <b>animals</b> <b>is</b> the {{practice}} of humans eating <b>animals</b> that <b>are</b> still alive. It is a traditional practice in many Asian food cultures.
