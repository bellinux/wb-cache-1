5|$|Gazan {{lawyer and}} church {{historian}} Sozomen, also {{a law student}} at Beirut, wrote in his Historia Ecclesiastica about Triphyllius, <b>a</b> <b>convert</b> to Christendom who became the bishop of Nicosia.

5|$|Some {{converts}} were sincerely devout {{in their}} Christian faith. Cisneros {{said that some}} converts chose to die as martyrs when demanded to recant by the Muslim rebels in Granada. <b>A</b> <b>convert</b> named Pedro de Mercado {{from the village of}} Ronda refused to join the rebellion in Granada; in response, the rebels burned his house and kidnapped members of his family, including his wife and a daughter. The crown later paid him compensation for his losses.|$|E
5|$|Back in London Emmeline {{was visited}} by Sylvia, {{who had not}} seen her mother in years. Their {{politics}} were by now very different, and Sylvia was living, unmarried, with an Italian anarchist. Sylvia described a moment of familial affection when they met, followed by a sad distance between them. Emmeline's adopted daughter Mary, however, remembered the meeting differently. According to her version, Emmeline set her teacup down and walked silently out of the room, leaving Sylvia in tears. Christabel, meanwhile, had become <b>a</b> <b>convert</b> to Adventism and devoted {{much of her time}} to the church. The British press sometimes made light of the varied paths followed by the once indivisible family.|$|E
5|$|From the 2nd to the 4th centuries, the Christian {{authors who}} would become the Latin Church Fathers were in active {{dialogue}} with the Classical tradition, within {{which they had been}} educated. Tertullian, <b>a</b> <b>convert</b> to Christianity from Roman Africa, was the contemporary of Apuleius and one of the earliest prose authors to establish a distinctly Christian voice. After the conversion of Constantine, Latin literature is dominated by the Christian perspective. When the orator Symmachus argued for the preservation of Rome's religious traditions, he was effectively opposed by Ambrose, the bishop of Milan and future saint—a debate preserved by their missives.|$|E

5|$|In {{the midst}} of the Great Depression, Calgary schoolteacher and radio evangelist William Aberhart became <b>a</b> <b>convert</b> to a British {{economic}} theory called social credit. Believing it could end the depression and restore prosperity, he began to promote it around Alberta. When the provincial government proved resistant to adopting it, Aberhart resolved to field social credit candidates in the 1935 provincial election. These candidates won 56 of the province's 63seats, and Aberhart became Premier of Alberta.|$|E
5|$|Ralph Adams Cram, the university's supervising architect, {{designed}} and oversaw {{construction of the}} new chapel. Cram sought to build a crown jewel for the Collegiate Gothic motif he had championed on the Princeton campus. The university's president, John Grier Hibben, also had {{a stake in the}} project: student hostility toward Princeton's brand of mainline Presbyterianism was on the rise. An ordained minister, Hibben hoped the new chapel's majesty would inspire students to attend services of their own volition. Cram, <b>a</b> <b>convert</b> to High Church Episcopalianism from Unitarianism, also lent support to this aim.|$|E

Samuel did not enroll his son in public schools. Despite his lack of formal education, Sadler read many books about history as a child and became a skilled public speaker at a young age. Samuel was <b>a</b> <b>convert</b> to the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and William was baptized into the {{denomination}} in 1888 and became devoutly religious.|$|E

The date of {{construction}} is unknown, {{but there was a}} church on this site in 1254 and the earliest feature to which a date can be given is a doorway in a 15th-century style dating to around 1500. When the church was restored in 1867 after being struck by lightning, stained glass with Islamic-influenced patterns was included in the windows, a requirement of Lord Stanley of Alderley, the church's benefactor, who was <b>a</b> <b>convert</b> to Islam.|$|E
5|$|Chief of the OKH, General Franz Halder, Fedor von Bock, the {{commander}} of Army Group Center, and almost all the German generals involved in Operation Barbarossa argued vehemently in favor of continuing the all-out drive toward Moscow. Besides the psychological importance of capturing the Soviet capital, the generals pointed out that Moscow was a major center of arms production, {{the center of the}} Soviet communications system and an important transport hub. Intelligence reports indicated that the bulk of the Red Army was deployed near Moscow under Semyon Timoshenko for the defense of the capital. Panzer commander Heinz Guderian was sent to Hitler by Bock and Halder to argue their case for continuing the assault against Moscow but Hitler issued an order through Guderian (bypassing Bock and Halder) to send Army Group Center's tanks to the north and south, temporarily halting the drive to Moscow. Convinced by Hitler's argument, Guderian returned to his commanding officers as <b>a</b> <b>convert</b> to the Führer's plan, which earned him their disdain.|$|E
5|$|John Michael Wright (May 1617 – July 1694) was a {{portrait}} painter in the Baroque style. Described variously as English and Scottish, Wright trained in Edinburgh under the Scots painter George Jamesone, and acquired a considerable {{reputation as an}} artist and scholar during a long sojourn in Rome. There he was admitted to the Accademia di San Luca, and was associated with some of the leading artists of his generation. He was engaged by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, the governor of the Spanish Netherlands, to acquire artworks in Oliver Cromwell's England in 1655. He took up permanent residence in England from 1656, and served as court painter before and after the English Restoration. <b>A</b> <b>convert</b> to Roman Catholicism, he was a favourite of the restored Stuart court, a client of both Charles II and James II, and was a witness to many of the political maneuverings of the era. In the final years of the Stuart monarchy he returned to Rome as part of an embassy to Pope Innocent XI.|$|E
