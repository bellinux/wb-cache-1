5|$|As {{early as}} 1969, the AMX-30 and {{variants}} were ordered by Greece, soon followed by Spain. In the coming years, the AMX-30 would be exported to Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Cyprus and Chile. By {{the end of}} production, 3,571 units of AMX-30s and its variants had been manufactured. Both Spain and Venezuela later began extensive modernization programs to {{extend the life of}} their vehicles <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> their tanks up to more modern standards. In the 1991 Gulf War, AMX-30s were deployed by both the French and Qatari armies. Qatari AMX-30s saw action against Iraqi forces at the Battle of Khafji.

5|$|Masashi Kishimoto {{developed}} {{the concept of}} jutsu in order to explain the superhuman feats that ninja performed in the Naruto series.

The use of hand seals substitutes for the incantations for magic found in other sources, and {{was based on the}} motions of ninja in various role-playing games.

5|$|The modern Norman Cob is {{slightly}} heavier {{than it was}} in the early 20th century, due to lighter horses of the breed being absorbed into the Selle Francais breed. In 1976, the National Stud at Saint-Lo had 186 stallions, including 60 Norman Cobs. In the same year, the breed registry was reorganized, and the Norman Cob placed in the draft horse category. The reorganization of the breed registry helped to reinvigorate Norman Cob breeding, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> attention to the risk of extinction of the breed. In 1980, the Institut national de la recherche agronomique and Institut national agronomique performed demographic and genetic analysis of threatened breeds of horses within France. In 1982, researchers concluded that the Norman Cob has been inbred and suffered genetic drift from its original population. The increasing average age of Norman Cob breeders also made the breed's situation precarious.|$|E

Though a friend of Pitt's government, he rarely {{attended}} the House; George Rose commented in a letter that Villiers's loss would have {{no impact on the}} Tories. While a member of parliament, in 1798, he married Lord Boringdon's daughter, Theresa, who would bear him ten children over the next two decades. After leaving Parliament, Villiers continued his presence at Court, and carried messages from the Princess Royal in Stuttgart to the king. In 1803, the duties of his office as paymaster were extended, and on 9 May, he was reappointed as Paymaster and Inspector-General of Marines, with a salary of £1,000 p.a. In the same year, he was commissioned a captain in the Watford Volunteer Cavalry. Villiers was prepared to intercede with the king on behalf of Pitt to fulfill the latter's desire for a more comprehensive ministry, which, however, was frustrated; <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> Pitt's friends into the Ministry of All the Talents in 1806.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} Middle Ages, Scottish armies were still largely {{assembled}} {{on the basis}} of common service and feudal obligations, with the addition of troops maintained by money contracts of bonds or bands of manrent. Common service theoretically called all men between the ages of 16 and 60 for a maximum of 40 days in one year. Such troops were expected to serve at their own expense <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> their own supplies, a factor that severely limited the ability of Scottish armies to take part in sustained campaigning. Feudalism had been introduced to Scotland in the twelfth century, meaning that knights held castles and estates in exchange for service, providing troops on a 40-day basis, particularly heavily armed noble cavalry. Bonds of manrent were similar to English indentures of the same period, used to retain more professional troops, particular men-at-arms and archers. Scotland relied on these systems longer than was the case in England. In practice, forms of service tended to blur and overlap, and major Scottish lords continued to bring contingents from their kindred. In 1513 for the Flodden campaign these systems were successful in producing a large and formidable force, but in the religious and politically divided mid-sixteenth century there is evidence that the authorities were experiencing increasing difficulty in recruitment.|$|E
5|$|On 27 June, Maisky {{agreed to}} the sending of two {{commissions}} to Spain, to enumerate foreign volunteer forces, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> about their withdraw. It was estimated to cost £1,750,000 to £2,250,000, borne by member countries of the Committee. The Nationalists wished to prevent {{the fall of the}} favourable Chamberlain government in the United Kingdom, and so were seen to accept the plan. With much bemoaning, the Republicans also accepted the plan. The Nationalists demanded belligerent rights first, then withdrawals of 10,000 from each side after, which amounted to a rejection of the plan. Following the Munich Agreement – judged by Chamberlain to have been a success – Britain would host similar mediation in Spain. Negrín would propose the removal of the International Brigades, a majority of whom were now Spaniards, at the last meeting of the League of Nations, thereby showing his contempt for the Non-Intervention Committee. Similarly, Italians would leave Spain under the Anglo-Italian agreement, not through the Committee.|$|E

5|$|Over the Stock Exchange floor, Pflueger {{mounted a}} ceiling {{composed}} of interconnected sheet metal strips above {{which he used}} indirect lighting to soften the edges and reduce shadows made by traders on the floor below. The result was so effective that Pflueger used it on a much larger scale above the audience seating at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, where it extended from and formed a continuity with the incised art on the proscenium. In Oakland, Pflueger flanked the stage with structures {{that appeared to be}} pillars supporting the proscenium but were instead layered, curved sheets of thin metal behind which lighting instruments cast light indirectly to give the columns a suffused glow. In 1931, he used the same concept to frame the stage at the Bal Tabarin (now Bimbo's 365 Club), <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> a changing palette of color to the ceiling above the dance floor. Pflueger filed for and, in 1934, received two architectural lighting design patents, one for his ceiling grid with indirect lighting and one for the thin metal panels hiding lighting instruments. He used the patented ceiling grid once more in the Patent Leather Bar, in 1939.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty {{ordered that}} the troops, but not their equipment, be {{unloaded}} from the cruisers {{on the evening}} of the 8th, and that the cruisers were to search forthwith for the German ships known to be at sea. This was later cancelled and the squadron was ordered to rendezvous with {{the main body of the}} Home Fleet. Later that day, German bombers attacked the British ships and Devonshire suffered a near-miss. On the 11th, the squadron was detached on an unsuccessful search for German ships in the area around Trondheim and rejoined the fleet two days later. Cunningham's ships were then detached to Tromsø where he conducted negotiations with local officials to refuel there <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> Norwegian troops west from Kirkenes. The squadron arrived there on the afternoon of the 15th and escorted Norwegian troopships back to Tromsø. Devonshire covered the evacuation of British and French troops from Namsos at the beginning of May and was nearly hit when the evacuation forces were attacked by German aircraft as they were withdrawing on 3 May.|$|E
5|$|Written {{language}} {{was introduced to}} Japan around 400 AD {{in the form of}} Chinese books written in Classical Chinese. Japanese interest in Chinese writings and culture gradually increased {{towards the end of the}} 6th century when Japanese rulers sent missions to the mainland for cultural studies, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> back books. During circa 300 years in the Sui and Tang Dynasties, a large number of Chinese books were brought to Japan. By the 8th century, Chinese works were customarily copied at Japanese libraries to satisfy the demand for education of the male aristocracy. Until the early 17th century, copying in Japan was largely by hand. However, Chinese printed editions of the Song Dynasty were imported following an increased trading activity at the start of the Kamakura period (after 1192). The designated manuscripts are either transcriptions of the original works produced in China or in Japan or are Chinese printed editions. The Chinese manuscripts, both handwritten and printed editions, were imported to Japan at the time. The designated treasures are housed in temples, museums, libraries, shrines, universities and in private collections.|$|E
