40|$|International audienceThe {{comparison}} of segment lengths, relief, and gravity signature along the very slow spreading Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) between 49 øE and 69 øE {{suggests that the}} marked change in segmentation style that occurs across the Melville transform (60 ø 45 'E) reflects {{a change in the}} modes of formation of the axial topography. We propose that the <b>axial</b> <b>relief</b> east of Melville is largely due to volcanic constructions that load the axial lithosphere from above. By contrast, the <b>axial</b> <b>relief</b> in segments west of the Melville fracture zone appears to be primarily due, as proposed for segments of the faster spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge, to along-axis changes in the depth of the axial valley, and to partial compensation of negative loads (thicker lower crust and/or lighter upper mantle) acting within the plate, or {{at the bottom of the}} plate. In terms of geology, this means that the contribution of the uppermost, effusive, part of the crust to along-axis crustal thickness variations may be greater east of Melville than in other regions of the study area. Regional axial depths suggest that the ridge east of Melville is also characterized by a low melt supply and is underlain by cold mantle. A simple model of mantle melting and regional isostatic compensation suggests that differences in mantle temperature and in melt thickness between this deep eastern ridge region, and the shallower region west of the Gallieni transform (52 ø 20 'E), are of the order of 80 øC and 4 km, respectively...|$|E
40|$|We use {{data from}} an {{extensive}} multibeam bathymetry {{survey of the}} Chile Ridge to study tectonomagmatic processes at the ridge axis. Specifically, we investigate how abyssal hills evolve from axial faults, how variations in magmatic extension influence morphology and faulting along the spreading axis, and how these variations correlate with ridge segmentation. The bathymetry data are used to estimate the fraction of plate separation accommodated by normal faulting, and the remaining fraction of extension, M, is attributed primarily to magmatic accretion. Results show that M ranges from 0. 85 to 0. 96, systematically increasing from first-order and second-order ridge segment offsets toward segment centers as the depth of ridge axis shoals relative to the flanking highs of the axial valley. Fault spacing, however, does not correlate with ridge geometry, morphology, or M along the Chile Ridge, which suggests the observed increase in tectonic strain toward segment ends is achieved through increased slip on approximately equally spaced faults. Variations in M along the segments follow variations in petrologic indicators of mantle melt fraction, both showing a preferred length scale of 50620 km that persists even along much longer ridge segments. In comparison, mean M and <b>axial</b> <b>relief</b> fail to show significant correlations with distance offsetting the segments. These two findings suggest a form of magmatic segmentation that is partially decoupled from the geometry of the plate boundary. We hypothesize this magmatic segmentation arises from cells of buoyantly upwelling mantle that influence tectonic segmentation from the mantle, up...|$|E

40|$|A new marine {{geophysical}} {{study in the}} central Gulf of California provides new insights into uppercrustal processes associated with the transition from continental rifting to seafloor spreading. This research {{is based on the}} collection and processing of multibeam bathymetry, 3. 5 kHz profiles, and two multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection grids collected throughout the central Gulf of California. One high-resolution MCS profile collected across the Southern Trough of Guaymas Basin shows alternations of seismically transparent sedimentary units and horizontally layered strata with high-amplitude internal reflectors. Correlation with DSDP drilling results reveals that reflector alternations are due to cyclical changes between diatomaceous mud turbidites and mud turbidites rich in terrigenous clastics driven by glacial/interglacial cyclicity. This correlation is also supported by the spatial extent of the seismic units, specifically the distance off-axis at which they intercept an intrusion-sediment complex that spreads away from the axis at ̃ 23 km/Myr. Seismic stratigraphy also shows that during glacials, accumulation rates in the southwest part of Guaymas Basin increased significantly, filling the axial trough. During interglacials, greater aridity and higher sea-level reduced the delivery of terrigneous clastics and axial extension outpaced sedimentation, resulting in regeneration of the <b>axial</b> rift <b>relief.</b> Throughout the central Gulf, analysis of MCS and 3. 5 kHz profiles and multibeam bathymetry reveals extensive evidence of shallow, young magmatic intrusions into unconsolidated hemipelagic muds blanketing axial troughs, off-axis oceanic crust, and thinned continental crust. Multiple sills 1 - 2 km in diameter have a characteristic concave-upwards profile are most common as off-axis intrusions into unconsolidated hemipelagic muds flooring the Guaymas, Carmen, and Farallon Basins, and within the sediment cover of subsided continental crust at the basins' margins. Integration of geophysical datasets suggests that concave-upwards sills have circular to elliptical three-dimensional geometry. Plotting concave upwards sill width against emplacement depth reveals an overall linear trend (deeper = wider sill) and modeling results suggest emplacement depth as a main control on sill structure. MCS and 3. 5 kHz profiles also show extensive evidence of hydrothermal fluid flow and hydrocarbon generation above multiple sills including pipe -like features, pockmarks, acoustic turbidity, bright spots, negative polarities, and eye-like structures interpreted as hydrothermal deposit...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} an elastohydrodynamic {{lubrication}} (EHL) solution method {{has been developed}} for helical Gears. Helical gears mesh {{with each other and}} develop contact areas under load that are approximately elliptical in shape. The contact ellipses have aspect ratios which are large and lubricant entrainment takes place in the rolling / sliding direction which is along the minor axis of the contact ellipse. The contact between helical gear teeth is therefore considered as a point contact EHL problem and the EHL analysis has been developed to include all aspects of the correct gear geometry. This includes the variation in radius of relative curvature at the contact over the meshing cycle, the introduction of tooth tip relief to prevent premature tooth engagement under load, and <b>axial</b> profile <b>relief</b> to prevent edge contact at the face boundaries of the teeth. The EHL solution is first obtained as a quasi-steady state analysis at different positions in the meshing cycle and then developed into a transient analysis for the whole meshing cycle. The software developed has been used to assess the effects of geometrical modifications such as tip <b>relief</b> and <b>axial</b> crowning on the EHL performance of a gear, and different forms of these profile modifications are studied. The analysis shows that the transient squeeze film effect becomes significant when the contact reaches the tip relief zone. Thinning of the film thickness occurs in this region and is associated with high values of pressure which depend on the form of tip relief considered. A transient EHL analysis for helical gears having faceted tooth surfaces has also been developed. Such surface features arise from the manufacturing process and can {{have a significant effect on}} the predicted transient EHL behaviour. The EHL results have been found to depend significantly on the facet spacing and thus on the manufacturing process. The important effect of surface roughness is also considered by developing a three dimensional line contact model to include real surface roughness information by considering a finite length of the nominal contact in the transverse direction of the tooth. This model is based on the use of the fast Fourier transform method to provide the repetition of the solution space along the nominal contact line between the helical teeth with the inclusion of cyclic boundary conditions at the transverse boundaries of the solution space. In helical gears the lay of tooth roughness (direction of finishing) is generally inclined to the direction in which rolling (entrainment) and sliding take place, and this is found to have a significant effect on both film thickness and pressure distribution...|$|R
40|$|The {{rheology}} of oceanic lithosphere {{is primarily}} a function of temperature, the abundance and distribution of lithologies and fluids, and their mechanical properties. Rheology controls the overall strength and mode of deformation. Seafloor morphology is the surface expression of this deformation, modified by additional processes such as volcanism. Rheological models are key to interpreting both naturally deformed rocks as direct indicators of deformation conditions and the resulting morphology. Simple thermo-mechanical models have proven useful to study ridge processes, but are limited by {{lack of knowledge of}} lithospheric architecture, composition, and rheology. The mechanical properties of some components (olivine, dolerite, olivine plus melt, serpentinite) are reasonably known, but must be extended to other important materials such as alteration products and include the role of fluids and compositional variations. While the overall composition of oceanic lithosphere is relatively well known, particularly for fast-spreading ridges, the distribution and abundance of melt and alteration products is not. Though sparse, these weak phases can strongly control the overall strength, mode and localization of deformation. Thermo-mechanical models successfully reproduce observed <b>axial</b> <b>relief</b> and general faulting patterns. They provide plausible mechanisms of lithospheric behavior, but cannot constrain actual deformation processes. In particular, they must assume rheology, thermal structure, and composition and distribution of materials, and are non-unique. The most accurate constraints on rheology and deformation processes will come from study of naturally deformed rocks. This will guide the choice of the models used to interpret morphology and infer the detailed thermal structure under ridges. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{results of}} surveys conducted along the slow to ultra-slow spreading {{axis of the}} Northern North Fiji Basin (NNFB), including the Hazel Holmes, Tripartite and South Pandora Ridges, and the newly discovered Futuna and North Cikobia spreading centers. Spreading segments along these axes display highly contrasted axial morphologies, ranging from a rift valley to a prominent axial high. In some places, abrupt inversions of topography are observed between neighboring segments. Detailed analyses of bathymetry and backscatter maps reveal that axial highs are spotted with numerous coalescent volcanoes forming features ranging from irregular terrains to well-organized ridges. The volcanic edifices are distributed over a wide neovolcanic zone, which corresponds to the <b>axial</b> <b>relief,</b> suggesting on important contribution of volcanism to the relief construction. Comparisons between various ridge-shaped segments reveal that axial volcano-tectonic patterns {{are directly related to}} the local magma production and delivery, in a context of tectonic extension related to plate divergence, and suggest that coalescent volcanoes are fed from multiples short-lived and unconnected magma lenses. In the competition between horizontal and vertical accretion of oceanic crust, the spreading centers of the NNFB represent a special case where lava production is locally high enough and spreading rate is low enough to allow prominent axial highs to develop. The along axis morphologic variability is related to intermittent volcanic activity that may result from rapid temporal and spatial variations in the distribution of upper mantle convection cells below accretion centers, superimposed on the regional thermal anomaly located under the whole basin...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a recent {{bathymetric}} and geophysical investigation of a 650 km-long portion of the very slowly opening (16 mm=yr full rate) Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) between 15 º 300 E and 25 ºE are presented. Bathymetry and mantle Bouguer gravity anomalies (MBA), caused by variations in crustal thickness and=or crustal and upper mantle densities, show different characteristics from those observed at faster spreading centers like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) (20 – 30 mm=yr full rate). With {{the exception of the}} Du Toit Transform, none of the ridge-axis discontinuities have offsets greater than 10 km and few of the discontinuities have clearly defined off-axis traces. The MBA patterns associated with individual segments are much more complex than the simple circular bull’s eyes lows reported along the MAR. While the short wavelength ridge segment length is comparable to that of the MAR, there is little correlation with MBA amplitude and segment length and <b>axial</b> <b>relief.</b> Furthermore, an eastward propagating magma source and an 84 km-long zone of oblique spreading appears to define a fundamental boundary along the SWIR between two 250 – 300 km-long sections characterized by distinctly different axial morphology and gravity signatures. We interpret these results to indicate a long-wavelength segmentation pattern of the underlying upwelling mantle. Melt separates from the upwelling mantle {{at the base of the}} lithosphere and is channeled to the surface along dikes.

40|$|Niu, Y., O'Hara, M. J. (2008). Global {{correlations}} of ocean ridge basalt chemistry with axial depth: A new perspective. Journal of Petrology, 49 (4), 633 - 664. The petrological parameters Na- 8 and Fe- 8, which are Na 2 O and FeO contents in mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) melts corrected for fractionation effects to MgO 8 wt, {{have been widely}} used as indicators of the extent and pressure of mantle melting beneath ocean ridges. We find that these parameters are unreliable. Fe- 8 is used to compute the mantle solidus depth (P-o) and temperature (T-o), and it is the values and range of Fe- 8 that have led to the notion that mantle potential temperature variation of Delta T-P= 250 K is required to explain the global ocean ridge systematics. This interpreted Delta T-P= 250 K range applies to ocean ridges away from hotspots. We find no convincing evidence that calculated values for P-o, T-o, and Delta T-P using Fe- 8 have any significance. We correct for fractionation effect to Mg#= 0. 72, which reveals mostly signals of mantle processes because melts with Mg#= 0. 72 are in equilibrium with mantle olivine of Fo(896) (vs evolved olivine of Fo(881796) in equilibrium with melts of Fe- 8). To reveal first-order MORB chemical systematics as a function of ridge axial depth, we average out possible effects of spreading rate variation, local-scale mantle source heterogeneity, melting region geometry variation, and dynamic topography on regional and segment scales by using actual sample depths, regardless of geographical location, within each of 22 ridge depth intervals of 250 m on a global scale. These depth-interval averages give Fe(72) 7585, which would give Delta T-P= 41 K (vs similar to 250 K based on Fe- 8) beneath global ocean ridges. The lack of Fe 72 Si 72 and Si(72) ridge depth correlations provides no evidence that MORB melts preserve pressure signatures as a function of ridge axial depth. We thus find no convincing evidence for Delta T-P> 50 K beneath global ocean ridges. The averages have alsorevealed significant {{correlations of}} MORB chemistry (e. g. Ti- 72, Al- 72, Fe- 72, Mg- 72, Ca- 72, Na- 72 and Ca- 72 /Al- 72) with ridge axial depth. The chemistrydepth correlation points to an intrinsic link between the two. That is, the similar to 5 km global ridge <b>axial</b> <b>relief</b> and MORB chemistry both result from a common cause: subsolidus mantle compositional variation (vs Delta T-P), which determines the mineralogy, lithology and density variations that (1) isostatically compensate the similar to 5 km ocean ridge relief and (2) determine the first-order MORB compositional variation on a global scale. A progressivelymore enriched (or less depleted) fertile peridotite source (i. e. high Al 2 O 3 and Na 2 O, and low CaO/Al 2 O 3) beneath deep ridges ensures a greater amount of modal garnet (high Al 2 O 3) and higher jadeite/diopside ratios in clinopyroxene (high Na 2 O and Al 2 O 3, and lower CaO), making a denser mantle, and thus deeper ridges. The dense fertile mantle beneath deep ridges retards the rate and restricts the amplitude of the upwelling, reduces the rate and extent of decompression melting, gives way to conductive cooling to a deep level, forces melting to stop at such a deep level, leads to a short melting column, and thus produces less melt and probably a thin magmatic crust relative to the less dense (more refractory) fertile mantle eneath shallow ridges. Compositions of primitive MORB melts result from the combination of two different, but genetically related processes: (1) mantle source inheritance and (2) melting process enhancement. The subsolidus mantle compositional variation needed to explain MORB chemistry and ridge axial depth variation requires a deep isostatic compensation depth, probably in the transition zone. Therefore, although ocean ridges are of shallow origin, their working is largely controlled by deep processes as well as the effect of plate spreading rate variation at shallow levels.
