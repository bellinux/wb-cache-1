500|$|According to Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot, Yeezus is a [...] "hostile, {{abrasive}} and intentionally off-putting" [...] {{album that}} combines [...] "the worlds of" [...] 1980s Chicago acid-house and 2013 Chicago drill music, 1990s industrial music, and the [...] "avant-rap" [...] of Saul Williams, Death Grips and Odd Future. The Independent, [...] Mass Appeal, and The Village Voice {{described it as}} an experimental release. Rolling Stone described it as [...] "an extravagantly abrasive album full of grinding electro, pummeling minimalist hip-hop, drone-y wooz and industrial gear-grind." [...] Slant Magazine critic Ted Scheinman described the album as [...] "built on alien, angular beats, slowly morphing drones and sirens, abrupt periods of silence, and a pulse-quickening style of delivery from Yeezy himself," [...] writing that West reconceives the [...] "notion {{of what kind of}} music (or noise) can underpin hip-hop." [...] According to Charles Aaron of Spin, Yeezus is [...] "a hip hop album, not a rap album", because of how its sounds and subject matter are assembled together, and although listeners can hear [...] "'punk' or 'post-punk' or 'industrial'" [...] throughout, [...] "hip-hop has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>about</b> noise and dissonance and dance music as agitation". The album also incorporates elements of industrial and trap music. The record [...] "most closely resembles" [...] 1990s industrial rock, during which the genre had a significant pop culture impact, with artists such as Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, and Marilyn Manson gaining success. The industrial scene created a [...] "vast global underground community," [...] and Esquire notes that one of its epicenters was in Chicago, where West was raised. Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club characterized its opening series of songs as electro and industrial hip hop. West, himself would later go onto describe the sound of the album as [...] "a protest to music" ...|$|E

For instance, the historian Owen Davies believed that the written charms supplied by cunning folk displayed the [...] "intrinsic Christian content of [...] magic" [...] {{and the influence of}} mystical and magical words taken from the Bible. Historian Ronald Hutton concurred with this assessment, remarking that [...] "Looking at the recorded charms dispensed by magical practitioners, it is obvious that many – perhaps the majority – are Christian in character. They quote from the Bible, or appeal to the Trinity, or to Jesus, or to saints. In most cases, to be sure, they are using the trappings and symbols of Christianity with little regard to what the churchmen would have regarded as its essence; the Bible...

2500|$|Tying {{artificial}} flies has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>about</b> imitating {{some form}} of fish prey. Significant literature on the concepts of imitation exists especially for trout flies. A Book of Trout Flies – Jennings (1935), Streamside Guide to Naturals & Their Imitations – Art Flick (1947), Matching the Hatch – Schweibert (1955), Selective Trout - Swisher and Richards (1971), Nymphs - Schweibert (1973), Caddisflies - LaFontaine (1989), Prey - Richards (1995) are a few 20th-century titles that deal extensively with imitating natural prey. From a human perspective, many fly patterns do not exactly imitate fish prey found in nature, but they are nevertheless successful. A successful or [...] "killing" [...] fly pattern imitates something that the target species preys on. This has resulted in fly tyers and fishers devising additional terms to characterize those flies that obviously do not imitate anything in particular, yet are nevertheless successful at catching fish. These additional terms are inconsistently but commonly associated with trout-fly patterns because of their huge variety, both historical and contemporary. The term Attractor pattern {{has been applied to}} flies which resemble nothing in particular but are successful in attracting strikes from fish (Trout Fishing, Brooks 1972). In Flies for Trout (1993) Dick Stewart characterizes these same patterns as General Purpose. Dave Hughes, in Trout Flies-The Tier’s Reference (1999), describes the same flies as Searching flies and characterizes three levels of imitation: Impressionistic, Suggestive and Imitative.|$|E

The release of this nature, was due to illegal downloading, and the record label was attempting to avoid illegal downloads as much as possible as Roberts stated, [...] "it's now harder for artists". Talking of Girls Aloud, Roberts stated she was used to releasing a song after around six weeks of promotion, including radio, television and press promotion, and commented that it was [...] "very scary" [...] to release a song without this publicity. She also noted the effect of this kind of release against chart positions, she said, [...] "I think it's harder for the public now because it's <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>about</b> the chart position.

[...] The album artwork and track-listing were confirmed on 22 August 2011 on Roberts official website, the announcement came with confirmation that fans who pre-ordered the album on Play.com would receive a signed poster, and those who pre-ordered the song from digital store iTunes would have an exclusive highlight video montage of her webisode series Through Nicola's Eyes.
