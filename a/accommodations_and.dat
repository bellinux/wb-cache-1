About 1.25 million people fled the storm in Florida alone, contributing to a region-wide total of nearly 2 million evacuees.

5|$|From 4 September 1939 to 19 June 1940, Styer was {{a student}} at the Army Industrial College. He became the {{commanding}} officer of the 8th Engineer Squadron at Fort McIntosh, Texas, from 3 August to 24 November 1940, and was executive officer of the Engineer Replacement Center at Fort Humphreys and Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. On 12 December 1940, he was assigned to the Construction Division in the Office of the Quartermaster General. The US Army was about to embark on a national mobilization, and it was the task of the Construction Division to prepare the necessary <b>accommodations</b> <b>and</b> training facilities for the vast army that would be created. This enormous construction program had been dogged by bottlenecks, shortages, delays, spiralling costs, and poor living conditions at the construction sites, and newspapers published accounts charging it with incompetence, ineptitude, and inefficiency.|$|E
5|$|Groves {{instituted a}} series of reforms. He {{installed}} phone lines for the Supervising Construction Quartermasters, demanded weekly reports on progress, ordered that reimbursement vouchers be processed within a week, and sent expediters to sites reporting shortages. He ordered his contractors to hire whatever special equipment they needed and to pay premium prices if necessary to guarantee quick delivery. Instead of allowing construction of camps to proceed in whatever order the contractors saw fit, Groves laid down priorities for completion of camp facilities, so that the troops could begin moving in even while construction was still under way. By mid-December, {{the worst of the}} crisis was over. Over half a million men had been mobilized and essential <b>accommodations</b> <b>and</b> facilities for two million men were 95 per cent complete. Between 1 July 1940 and 10 December 1941, the Construction Division let contracts worth $1,676,293,000 ($ with inflation), of which $1,347,991,000 ($ with inflation), or about 80 per cent, were fixed-fee contracts.|$|E
40|$|Poor visual {{ergonomics}} {{is associated}} with visual and neck/shoulder discomfort, but the relation between visual demands and neck/shoulder muscle activity is unclear. The aims {{of this study were}} to investigate whether trapezius muscle activity was affected by: (i) eye-lens accommodation; (ii) incongruence between <b>accommodation</b> <b>and</b> convergence; and (iii) presence of neck/shoulder discomfort. Sixty-six participants (33 controls and 33 with neck pain) performed visually demanding near work under four different trial-lens conditions. Results showed that eye-lens accommodation per se did not affect trapezius muscle activity significantly. However, when incongruence between <b>accommodation</b> <b>and</b> convergence was present, a significant positive relationship between eye-lens <b>accommodation</b> <b>and</b> trapezius muscle activity was found. There were no significant group-differences. It was concluded that incongruence between <b>accommodation</b> <b>and</b> convergence {{is an important factor in}} the relation between visually demanding near work and trapezius muscle activity. The relatively low demands on <b>accommodation</b> <b>and</b> convergence in the present study imply that visually demanding near work may contribute to increased muscle activity, and over time to the development of near work related neck/shoulder discomfort...|$|R

5|$|In 2014 and 2015 several {{incidents}} involving worker mistreatment surfaced, {{indicating that}} employment agencies often neglect workers' rights or are complicit in {{the cycle of}} abuse; {{there have also been}} many instances of failure to provide service to employers. According to media reports, between 2009 and 2012 the Consumer Council in Hong Kong received nearly 800 complaints about agencies. Many complaints concerned workers who did not match the descriptions provided, {{to the extent that it}} was suspected that the agencies deliberately misrepresented the workers' experience. The 2015 death of Elis Kurniasih, awaiting her work visa before beginning employment, exposed grey areas and legal loopholes in the Employment Agency Regulations; Kurniasih was crushed to death by falling masonry at an agency boarding house in North Point. Worker protections against illegal fees, unsanitary <b>accommodations</b> <b>and</b> lack of insurance were criticised as inadequate.|$|E
5|$|Such {{restrictions}} dated back {{to colonial}} times, and were {{found throughout the}} United States. After the end of legal slavery in the North {{and later in the}} South after the Civil War, most freedmen continued to live at little more than a subsistence level, but a minority of African Americans gained a measure of prosperity. They could plan leisure travel for the first time. Well-to-do blacks arranged large group excursions for as many as 2000 people at a time, for instance traveling by rail from New Orleans to resorts along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. In the pre-Jim Crow era this necessarily meant mingling with whites in hotels, transportation and leisure facilities. They were aided in this by the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which had made it illegal to discriminate against African Americans in public <b>accommodations</b> <b>and</b> public transportation.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} and political differences between western and eastern Virginia began to grow. Following Virginia's secession from the Union in 1861, the Restored Government of Virginia was established at Wheeling during the American Civil War. Despite West Virginia receiving Union statehood on June 20, 1863, sympathies and loyalties within the state's borders remained divided, especially within areas economically dependent upon the plantation system. However, slaveowners in western Virginia tended to own fewer slaves {{than their counterparts in}} eastern Virginia and many did not support Virginia's secession. In Mason County, where small farms were reliant upon slavery, its residents overwhelmingly supported the Union cause. During the war, many plantations in West Virginia served as preferred venues for military headquarters and meeting places for both Union and Confederate military officers due to their adequate <b>accommodations</b> <b>and</b> resources. Altona near Charles Town was utilized as a military headquarters and meeting place for Union generals Philip Sheridan and Ulysses S. Grant, with Sheridan making use of the farm's horses and carriage. Other plantations, like Mill Island and Willow Wall near Moorefield, and Elmwood near Shepherdstown, were utilized as hospitals for wounded soldiers and irregulars.|$|E
