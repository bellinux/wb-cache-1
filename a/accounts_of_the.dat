5|$|In William Urban's summary, {{almost all}} <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle {{made before the}} 1960s were more {{influenced}} by romantic legends and nationalistic propaganda than by fact.

5|$|The {{agents of}} the Catholic Church wrote {{detailed}} <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maya, in support of their efforts at evangelization, and absorption of the Maya into the Spanish Empire. This was followed by various Spanish priests and colonial officials who left descriptions of ruins they visited in Yucatán and Central America. In 1839, American traveller and writer John Lloyd Stephens set out to visit a number of Maya sites with English architect and draftsman Frederick Catherwood. Their illustrated <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ruins sparked strong popular interest, and brought the Maya {{to the attention of}} the world. The later 19th century saw the recording and recovery of ethnohistoric <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maya, and the first steps in deciphering Maya hieroglyphs.|$|E
