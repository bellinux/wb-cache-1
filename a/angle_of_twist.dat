40|$|In this article, the postbuckling {{analysis}} of axially compressed elements of arbitrary cross section is presented {{taking into account}} moderately large displacements, moderately large <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> and employing nonlinear relationships between bending moments and curvatures. The elements are supported by the most general boundary conditions including elastic support or restraint. Based on Galerkin's method and approximating the displacement field of the element by polynomial expressions the governing differential equations lead to a nonlinear algebraic system. The geometric, inertia, torsion and warping constants of the arbitrary beam cross section are evaluated employing the boundary element method. The proposed formulation does not stand on the assumption of a thin-walled structure and therefore the cross section's torsional rigidity is evaluated exactly without using the so-called Saint-Venant's torsional constant. Both the Wagner's coefficients and the shortening effect are taken into account, while their influence is examined and discussed.

40|$|In this paper, a {{boundary}} element method is {{developed for the}} nonuniform torsion of simply or multiply connected bars of doubly symmetrical arbitrary constant cross section, taking into account secondary torsional moment deformation effect. The bar is subjected to arbitrarily distributed or concentrated twisting and warping moments, while its edges are restrained by the most general torsional boundary conditions. To account for secondary shear deformations, the concept of shear deformation coefficient is used leading to a secondary torsion constant. Four boundary value problems {{with respect to the}} variable along the bar primary and secondary <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> and to the primary and secondary warping functions are formulated and solved employing a pure BEM approach, that is only boundary discretization is used. The warping and the primary torsion constants are evaluated employing the aforementioned primary and secondary warping functions using only boundary integration, while the secondary torsion constant is computed employing an effective automatic domain integration. Numerical examples with great practical interest are worked out to illustrate the efficiency and the range of applications of the developed method. The influence of the secondary torsional moment deformation effect of closed shaped cross sections is verified, while the accuracy of the proposed numerical procedure for the calculation of the secondary torsion constant compared with a FEM one is noteworthy.

40|$|Recently, {{morphing}} structures {{have found}} increased interest {{due to their}} potential for combining conflicting requirements of strength, flexibility and low mass. Many concepts depend on continuously powered actuators to deform the structure. Others possess multiple stable states, i. e. multi-stability and power is only needed to change the shape, not to hold it. This dissertation explores the design space of a helical morphing, composite, <b>twisting</b> structure capable <b>of</b> large deformations along its axis <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> with non-linear stiffness properties. Multi-stability is achieved {{by a combination of}} pre-stress, geometry of the structure and material properties. Multi-stability is fully exploited by demonstrating the capability of the helix to be bi-stable or, depending on the design parameters, to hold any twisted configuration; hence presenting the remarkable property of zero torsional stiffness. Three proof-of-concept case studies are detailed: simple helices, a wind turbine twisting tip and a bi-stable I-beam. In the first instance, the helical structure is investigated and analytically modelled. Prototypes are developed to verify the non-linear stiffness properties of the structure and experimental results are correlated against analytical and finite element model data. Three different stability characteristics are explored and detailed. Multi-stability is analysed using a simple analytical model, predicting the positions of stable and unstable states for different design parameters and material properties. Actuation using piezoelectric material is also explored in a separate analytical study. Then, the negative stiffness property of the pre-stressed structure is incorporated into a half-scale twisting wind turbine blade. Overall, the manufactured blade achieves zero stiffness in torsion for <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> between _ 5 ° to + 5 ° due to the added helical structure. Finally, a common structural component, the I-beam, is redesigned to show bi-stability. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
