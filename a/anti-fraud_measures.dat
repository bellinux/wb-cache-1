5000|$|Gold {{trading was}} {{significant}} for the U.S.'s foreign trade, {{but the majority of}} trading on the Exchange was speculative. Historian John Steele Gordon notes that [...] "hundreds of pure speculators" [...] traded at Gilpin's, but that [...] "respectable merchants who needed gold for business purposes or to hedge against fluctuations in the price of greenbacks" [...] also traded there. Business historian Robert Sobel has called the gold exchange [...] "the most informal and certainly the wildest market in American history" [...] because of its wild profit and loss swings, its high rate of bankruptcy and frequent occurrences of [...] "short-changing, adulteration, and late delivery" [...] of gold. After a series of robberies of gold, brokers at the exchange set up a system of private certificates which could be drawn upon deposits at the Bank of New York. As a result of the arrangement, the Bank of New York became the second-largest holder of gold in the nation, after the U.S. federal government. In 1865, however, E. B. Ketchum of Ketchum, Son & Co. forged more than $1.5 million certificates and then fled; this and other such episodes prompted the establishment of a Gold Exchange Bank, with daily account reserve statements and other <b>anti-fraud</b> <b>measures.</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The FSA Financial Crime Sector Leader, Philip Robinson, {{outlined}} the FSA's new policy on fraud within the regulated sector in his October 2004 speech. The FSA subsequently undertook {{a review of}} 16 regulated firms and how to prevent and detect fraud. This paper considers {{the findings of the}} FSA's Firm's High-Level Management of Fraud Risk Report and the reference to financial crime in the FSA's recent Financial Risk Outlook 2006 and Business Plan 2005 / 2006. Design/methodology/approach – The topic has been approached to consider the development of the FSA's policy on fraud with reference to speeches and policy documents. Findings – That financial crime is a significant threat to the financial services sector. Firms have taken proactive steps to tackie fraud, but more can be done. The 2006 may see greater focus by the FSA on firms' <b>anti-fraud</b> <b>measures.</b> Originality/value – In examining the FSA's policy on anti-fraud management this papers seek identify what the FSA requires from firms in terms of <b>anti-fraud</b> <b>measures.</b> This paper should be of interest to compliance officers, MLRO Officers, fraud investigators and regulatory lawyers.

5000|$|Second, Title II of the CFMA treated credit default swaps tied to [...] "securities" [...] as [...] "security-related swaps" [...] {{for which}} the SEC was granted limited {{authority}} to enforce [...] "insider trading", fraud, and anti-manipulation provisions of the securities laws. Before the CFMA, it was generally agreed most swaps were not securities, but the SEC had always maintained that swaps tied to securities were securities, particularly when such swaps could reproduce the attributes of owning the underlying security. In granting the SEC authority over [...] "security-related swaps", the CFMA specifically prohibited applying any [...] "prophylactic" [...] <b>anti-fraud</b> or anti-manipulation <b>measures.</b> The SEC has complained this has prevented it from collecting information, and requiring disclosures, regarding credit default positions of investors. The SEC has argued this handicaps its ability to monitor possible manipulations of security markets through credit default swaps.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>anti-fraud</b> <b>measures</b> currently {{operating in}} Australia's welfare system, {{administered by the}} government agency, Centrelink. Using official data, an examination is made of the operations and rationales of different strategies and their impacts, including estimated savings. The paper covers nine strategies, including data-matching, public tip-offs, media campaigns, stepped-up investigations and recovery action. The findings indicate that Centrelink has adopted international best practice measures to combat fraud {{and appears to be}} particularly successful at detecting and stopping fraud. At the same time, the main challenge appears to lie in the area of finding and demonstrating more effective primary prevention measures.

40|$|This Article {{examines}} the significant problem of fraud within nonprofit organizations and demonstrates that current <b>anti-fraud</b> <b>measures</b> do not adequately reflect {{the important role}} employees play in perpetuating or stopping fraudulent activity. Psychological and organizational behavior studies have established the importance of (1) participation and (2) peers in shaping the behavior of individuals within the organizational context. This Article builds on that research and establishes that to successfully combat fraud, organizations must integrate employees into the design, implementation, and enforcement of anti-fraud strategy and procedures. Engaged, empowered employees will {{be less likely to}} commit fraud and more likely to dissuade their peers from fraudulent behavior. After examining the theory underlying the proposed approach, this Article sets forth directions and specific suggestions for designing an anti-fraud program that empowers employees...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} income-related housing {{support in}} Britain and the Netherlands. It considers the main {{issues that are}} at stake in current policy discussions, compares the arguments that are put forward {{in the two countries}} and draw conclusions about the future of income-related housing support. In both Britain and the Netherlands political discussions about the possible introduction of housing vouchers are observed. The most complicated issues are the poverty trap and unemployment trap, and housing consumption incentives. Moral hazard concerns can result in complicated <b>anti-fraud</b> <b>measures</b> that may add to the burden of administering income-related support. It is expected that the way in which income-related housing support schemes in both countries are designed and administered may come under closer scrutiny. Politicians want these schemes to be in tune with the need for labour and housing market mobility, wage flexibility, and the need to bring the public budget under control. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this chapter is to explore the {{financial}} crisis {{through the lens of}} market construction and thereby investigate the EU’s current strategies to tackle the financial crisis through measures taken to fight irregularities in the market. Before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty the EU had a very limited competence in the field of criminal law and therefore developed a unique tapestry for the enactment of sanctions through the framework of the internal market powers of Article 114 Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Although being a somewhat late response to the European financial crisis that started in 2008, the EU has in recent years increasingly focused on the need to adopt <b>anti-fraud</b> <b>measures</b> and other measures to stabilize the market. There is now an increased move towards regulatory strategies across different sectors in EU law particularly with regard to EU action within the financial market sphere...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{continuous}} assurance is not new, {{with a history}} spanning close to three decades in various guises. Recently there has been renewed attention in the area due to compliance imperatives, trends in governance and risk, <b>anti-fraud</b> <b>measures</b> and technological advances. However significant uncertainty surrounds the practicalities of how continuous assurance may be effectively implemented into an organisation’s governance, risk and compliance (GRC) landscape for auditors and managers. The aim {{of this paper is}} to report on the first stage of a research study investigating the adoption and implementation of continuous assurance in an Australian company. A socio-material practice perspective is adopted and Power’s (2007) concept of organised uncertainty is explored to progress thinking in continuous assurance theory and practice. Key findings emerging from this study include the heterogeneous and fluid nature of continuous assurance, the duality of mobility involving system dependencies and audit independence, and the unanticipated usages and politics of information...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this paper}} is to present the {{challenges}} and developments of the Albanian insurance market during the process of its liberalization. Consequently the insurance market has shown instability with regard to the fluctuations of the premium levels. A fair pricing based on the market conditions is one of the biggest challenges of the albanian insurance market. By means of an econometric model, the correlation between the liberalization process and profitability of insurance companies has been shown. This paper discusses also the efficiency of the Bonus-Malus System, which is expected to be implemented in Albania in 2018 in order to stabilize the insurance market. In this regard the elasticity according to Loimaranta (1972) is calculated for Albania. As the Bonus-Malus System is already implemented in other region countries, the paper suggests that in addition to the advantages this system can bring, there is also the risk of the phenomenon known in the literature as “ Hunger for Bonus”, according to which, people tend to not report the claims. Under such conditions the result would be a lower claim frequency deriving from the non-reporting of claims and not from the implementation of the Bonus-Malus System. The implementation of the Bonus-Malus system must be accompanied by an increase of <b>anti-fraud</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|E
40|$|Neither Congress, the {{procuring}} agencies, the media, nor {{the public}} will condone government contractors reaping what are perceived as excessive profits. Accordingly, the procurement process employs an unduly complex, burdensome, risk-laden, and ineffective mechanism that erects significant barriers to civil/military integration. This paper (presented at the 1999 Defense Systems Management College (DSMC) Acquisition Research Symposium) examines certain policy implications associated with the Truth In Negotiations Act (TINA), the existing audit regime, {{and the use of}} criminal and civil <b>anti-fraud</b> <b>measures</b> to scrutinize deviations from these complex cost, pricing, and profit policies and controls. It re-visits the long-extinct Renegotiation Act and finds it less troubling than the existing quagmire. It analogizes to recent experience in the public utilities industry, which employs a sharing mechanism as an explicit, transparent means for addressing excessive profits. The paper proposes to simplify and decriminalize Federal procurement pricing and profit policy by drawing from the historical renegotiation experience. A transparent renegotiation regime (1) could be one less burdensome or complex element of a regulatory scheme that presents suppliers with a menu of regulatory options; (2) would allow contractors to select the approach that best corresponds to their own assessment of which contractual rules will minimize their costs; and (3) could permit the Government to share, directly or indirectly, in these increased efficiencies and savings...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore whether {{opportunities}} for fraud and corruption might be reduced or increased by rules governing public procurement. The focus is on specific European legislation – Procurement Directive 2004 / 18 on the coordination of procedures for the award of contracts for public works, public supply and public services by public bodies within all EU Member States – however similar issues would arise in other jurisdictions. Design/methodology/approach – The procurement process is examined in relation to three stages of procedure: preparation of specifications, selection of tenderers, and execution of contracts, within each of which some specific risks (red flags) are identified. Findings – Particular risks that may not have been sufficiently addressed, in terms of research or legislation, arise at the first of these stages; accordingly this paper focuses there. Generally, risks are summarised in terms of insider-driven specifications, low visibility of procurement processes, and ample opportunities for renegotiation of terms. Risks may be increased by innovative procurement practices that have the effect of extending the manoeuvring between tenderers and public bodies, such as competitive dialogue. Research limitations/implications – Fraud and corruption risk in public procurement is an area deserving detailed and comparative study, with special attention to the pre-contracting stage. Research on this topic within EU Member States should go hand in hand with enquiry into international procurement, and into the EC's own rules as applied by its institutions and bodies. Practical implications – Suggestions for risk-reduction are put forward in relation to quality standards and pre-award publicity. Originality/value – After some time as the Cinderella of crime policies, large-scale frauds attract greater interest. This paper gives grounds for asking whether, in relation to procurement fraud, a combination of traditional practices and modernisation may outpace <b>anti-fraud</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|E
