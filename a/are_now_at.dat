5|$|The Marshlink Action Group is a {{volunteer}} group {{set up in}} 2003 {{in the interests of}} passengers using the line. The group are concerned about its facilities, particularly the use of Class 171 DMUs when all connecting lines have been electrified. They have reported a high proportion of children and the elderly use the line compared to others in the south east, and that trains <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> capacity but there is no additional stock because of its state as an isolated non-electric line. In 2016, Rudd chaired a working group to look at short and long-term plans for upgrading the Marshlink line, including the potential accommodation of Class 395 rolling stock.|$|E
5|$|The {{submarine}} {{was used}} in filming the 1950 film, Morning Departure, a naval film directed by Roy Ward Baker. During the course of filming, the submarine depot ship HMS Maidstone {{was used as a}} mother ship for Tiptoe. In 1952 a further cinematic link was made when ballet dancer Moira Shearer presented a pair of size 3.5 satin ballet shoes to Tiptoe that she had worn in the 1948 film The Red Shoes. These <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> the Royal Navy Submarine Museum. Whilst in Tromsø harbour on 18 July 1955 Tiptoe was damaged when a coastal steamer collided with her. The steamer, a 2,162 tonne vessel called Nordlys, was entering the harbour when she collided with the British destroyer HMS Chevron. The steamer bounced off the destroyer and collided with Tiptoe, snapping her moorings as she was pushed halfway under a wooden quay.|$|E

25|$|The {{first of}} the new light rail systems in North America began {{operation}} in 1978 when the Canadian city of Edmonton, Alberta, adopted the German Siemens-Duewag U2 system, followed three years later by Calgary, Alberta, and San Diego, California. The concept proved popular, and although Canada has few cities big enough for light rail, there <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> least 30 light rail systems in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Since J. R. R. Tolkien {{had studied}} {{philology}} at Oxford and {{eventually became a}} professor, he was very familiar with the Red Book of Hergest which is kept at the Bodleian on behalf of Jesus College.

25|$|Ubiquitous as they <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> shrines, Komainu {{have been}} used {{outdoors}} only since the 14th century. In Asia, the lion was popularly believed to {{have the power to}} repel evil, and for this reason it was habitually used to guard gates and doors. In Japan, too it ended up being installed at the entrance of shrines and temples next to the lion-dog. As a protection against exposure to Japan's rainy weather, the komainu started being carved in stone.|$|E
25|$|The two wooden {{memorial}} crosses erected at High Wood and Eaucourt l'Abbaye by 47 Divisional Engineers in 1916 {{were falling}} into disrepair by 1925, {{when they were}} replaced in stone. The restored wooden crosses were preserved at the Duke of York's Headquarters in London (the former divisional HQ) until that building was sold in 2003, and <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> Connaught House, the HQ of the London Irish Rifles {{on the site of}} the former First Surrey Rifles drill hall at Flodden Road, Camberwell.|$|E
25|$|PRR's {{competitors}} managed {{this period}} better with their diesel locomotive rosters. PRR voluntarily preserved a roundhouse full of representative steam locomotives at Northumberland, Pennsylvania in 1957 and kept them there for several decades. These locomotives, {{with the exception}} of I1sa #4483 which is on display at Hamburg, New York, <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg, Pennsylvania. In sharp contrast, NYC's Alfred E. Perlman deliberately scrapped all but two large steam locomotives, and these survived only by accident.|$|E

25|$|Lead {{smelters}} {{contribute to}} several environmental problems, especially raised blood lead levels {{in some of}} the town population. The problem is particularly significant in many children who have grown up in the area. There is a government project to address this. Nyrstar plans to progressively reduce lead in blood levels such that ultimately 95% of all children meet the national goal of 10 micrograms per decilitre. This has been known as the tenby10 project. Community lead in blood levels in children <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> less than half the level that they were in the mid 1980s.|$|E
25|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union, Baku embarked on a process of restructuring on a scale unseen in its history. Thousands of buildings from the Soviet period were demolished {{to make way for a}} green belt on its shores; parks and gardens were built on the land reclaimed by filling up the beaches of the Baku Bay. Improvements were made in the general cleaning, maintenance, and garbage collection, and these services <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> Western European standards. The city is growing dynamically and developing at full speed on an east-west axis along the shores of the Caspian Sea. Sustainability has become a key factor in future urban development.|$|E
25|$|To {{the north}} of the Royal Ordnance Factory (ROF), Risley, was the site chosen for the design offices and {{headquarters}} of the Department of ATomic ENergy (DATEN) after the Second World War. Later to become the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), the offices were charged with the manufacture of the Nuclear Reactors and process plants at Windscale to help build the UKs atomic defence. Following on from the weapons program, the Risley offices were responsible for the building of the Magnox and AGR designs of reactor in the UK. In 1971 BNFL was set up from the production division of the (UKAEA), and until 2003 its headquarters were at Risley, near Warrington. BNFLs headquarters <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> Daresbury Park industrial estate, also near to Warrington.|$|E

25|$|Doctors' groups, patients, and {{insurance}} companies have criticized medical malpractice litigation as expensive, adversarial, unpredictable, and inefficient. They claim {{that the cost of}} medical malpractice litigation in the United States has steadily increased at almost 12 percent annually since 1975. More recent research from the same source has found that tort costs as a percentage of GDP dropped between 2001 and 2009, and <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> their lowest level since 1984. Jury Verdict Research, a database of plaintiff and defense verdicts, says awards in medical liability cases increased 43 percent in 1999, from $700,000 to $1,000,000. However, more recent research from the U.S. Department of Justice has found that median medical malpractice awards in states range from $109,000 to $195,000.|$|E
25|$|Koons {{then moved}} on to the Banality series. For this project he engaged {{workshops}} in Germany and Italy that had a long tradition of working in ceramic, porcelain, and wood. The series culminated in 1988 with Michael Jackson and Bubbles, a series of three life-size gold-leaf plated porcelain statues of the sitting singer cuddling Bubbles, his pet chimpanzee. Three years later, one of these sold at Sotheby's New York for US$5.6 million. Two of these sculptures <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM) in downtown Los Angeles. The statue was included in a 2004 retrospective at the Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art in Oslo which traveled a year later to the Helsinki City Art Museum. It also featured in his second retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, in 2008. The statue is currently back at the newly opened Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art at Tjuvholmen in Oslo.|$|E
