5|$|A related {{problem for}} aerobic organisms is {{oxidative}} stress. Here, processes including oxidative phosphorylation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of disulfide bonds during protein folding produce {{reactive oxygen species}} such as hydrogen peroxide. These damaging oxidants are removed by antioxidant metabolites such as glutathione and enzymes such as catalases and peroxidases.|$|E
5|$|All {{actinides}} are pyrophoric, {{especially when}} finely divided, that is, they spontaneously ignite upon reaction with air. The melting point of actinides {{does not have}} a clear dependence on the number of f-electrons. The unusually low melting point of neptunium and plutonium (~640°C) is explained by hybridization of 5f and 6d orbitals <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of directional bonds in these metals.|$|E

5|$|Bristol lies {{on one of}} the UK's lesser coalfields, {{and from}} the 17th century collieries opened in Bristol, and what is now North Somerset and South Gloucestershire.

5|$|Geothermal {{activity}} and the emission of volcanic gases are ongoing, and the volcano has been prospected {{for the possibility of}} obtaining geothermal energy. The geothermal activity has resulted in widespread rock alteration <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of sulfur deposits, which were mentioned in a 1909 report and later mined. Koh-i-Sultan also has deposits of other minerals.|$|E
5|$|Glycocalyx is {{produced}} by many bacteria to surround their cells, and varies in structural complexity: ranging from a disorganised slime layer of extracellular polymeric substances to a highly structured capsule. These structures can protect cells from engulfment by eukaryotic cells such as macrophages (part of the human immune system). They can also act as antigens and be involved in cell recognition, as well as aiding attachment to surfaces <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of biofilms.|$|E

5|$|PID {{can cause}} {{scarring}} inside the reproductive system, which can later cause serious complications, including chronic pelvic pain, infertility, ectopic pregnancy (the {{leading cause of}} pregnancy-related deaths in adult females), and other complications of pregnancy. Occasionally, the infection can spread to in the peritoneum causing inflammation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of scar tissue on the external surface of the liver (Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome).|$|E

In this episode, the story moves to the year 2370, when Commander William Riker grapples with making a difficult admission to his commanding officer about a cover-up. Riker, after consulting Counselor Troi, turns to the simulated events of the year 2161 for guidance, when the crew of Enterprise travels home to Earth for both decommissioning <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of the United Federation of Planets.|$|E
5|$|The IgG {{antibodies}} form {{a complex}} with heparin and PF4 in the bloodstream. The {{tail of the}} antibody then binds to the FcγIIa receptor, a protein {{on the surface of}} the platelet. This results in platelet activation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of platelet microparticles, which initiate the formation of blood clots; the platelet count falls as a result, leading to thrombocytopenia.|$|E

5|$|The first siding west of Saskatoon was Goodrich, {{which is}} more {{commonly}} known as Radisson today. There were two L.I.D.'s that formed the municipality. the northern one was L.I.D. 21-D-3 and the southern portion was L.I.D. 20-D-3 The local improvement districts administered the area between 1906 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of Great Bend No. 405 in 1910.

5|$|The most {{noteworthy}} {{reaction of}} TiCl4 is its easy hydrolysis, signaled by {{the release of}} hydrogen chloride <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of titanium oxides and oxychlorides, as described above {{for the production of}} TiO2. Titanium tetrachloride has been used to create naval smokescreens. The hydrogen chloride immediately absorbs water to form an aerosol of hydrochloric acid that efficiently scatter light. In addition, the highly refractive titanium dioxide is also an efficient light scatterer. This smoke is however corrosive.|$|E
50|$|The Spences Bridge Group is a 100-million-year-old {{volcanic}} {{group of}} the southern Intermontane Belt in British Columbia, Canada.

5|$|Wilson Popenoe and {{his wife}} in 1931, at a site in Honduras dating back to 600 AD, found the lower {{mandible}} of a young Mayan woman, with three missing incisors replaced by pieces of shell, shaped to resemble teeth.

5|$|After Dieppe the {{headquarters}} staff changed again. Lovat {{was promoted to}} brigadier and given command of the 1st Special Service Brigade. Mills-Roberts was promoted and sent to North Africa to take over command of No. 6 Commando. They were replaced by Robert Dawson as the CO and Ronald Menday as 2IC. Other changes included moving to a new base in Falmouth <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of a heavy weapons troop in each commando. The new troop with mortar and Vickers machine gun sections provided the heavy weapons needed for their new role as assault infantry. By now the Commandos had started {{to move away from}} smaller raiding operations. They were formed into units intended to spearhead future Allied landing operations. To assist in this they were given the organic fire support weapons, that had been absent when they were a raiding force.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{has also}} revealed two distinct lineages within this species, one occupying the western Atlantic {{and the other}} occupying the eastern Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. This suggests that Indo-Pacific blacktip sharks are descended {{from those in the}} eastern Atlantic, while the western Atlantic sharks became isolated by the widening Atlantic Ocean on one side <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of the Isthmus of Panama on the other. Blacktip sharks from these two regions differ in morphology, coloration, and life history characteristics, and the eastern Atlantic lineage may merit species status. Fossil teeth belonging to this species have been found in Early Miocene (2316 Ma) deposits in Delaware and Florida.|$|E
