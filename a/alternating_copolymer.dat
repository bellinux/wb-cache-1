40|$|This work aims to {{understand}} the mechanism of the thermal degradation of the ethylene-carbon monoxide (E-CO) <b>alternating</b> <b>copolymer</b> under mild conditions. The copolymer was subjected to accelerated ageing in an oven at different temperatures below the copolymer melting point, under argon atmosphere, {{and in the absence}} of light. The properties of the aged samples were compared with the properties of the untreated copolymer. Untreated and aged samples were analysed by mass spectroscopy (MS) with the direct introduction probe (DIP) and pyrolysis (Py) techniques. The accelerated ageing experiments showed that the thermal degradation of the E-CO <b>alternating</b> <b>copolymer</b> under inert atmosphere is characterized by chain cross-linking, loss of water, and changes in the UV absorption spectrum. The IR spectrum shows modifications only for highly degraded samples in which O-H and C=C groups are present. The experiments performed with the DIP-MS technique have confirmed that the E-CO <b>alternating</b> <b>copolymer</b> loses water during its thermal ageing. The pyrolysis products of the copolymer are linear molecules with 1, 4 -diketonic structure, 2 -cyclopentenone derivatives, alkyl furans, and aromatic compounds.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We study {{theoretically}} the viscoelastic {{relaxation of}} cross-linked copolymers {{in the framework}} of generalized Gaussian structures (GGS), which are extensions of the Rouse model to arbitrary geometries. The model holds for general homogeneous copolymers under free-draining conditions; it is especially suitable for treating <b>alternating</b> <b>copolymers.</b> We calculate the storage G′(ö) and the loss G′′(ö) moduli both for un-cross-linked and for cross-linked copolymer chains, and observe a variety of features: <b>alternating</b> <b>copolymers</b> differ from homopolymers in the high-frequency domain, where G′′(ö) may display two maxima. Cross-linking <b>alternating</b> A-B <b>copolymer</b> chains into regular networks (lattices) leads to the appearance of a network-dominated, low-frequency relaxation domain. In the case of very large differences in the mobility of the A monomers, of the B monomers, and of the cross-links, G′(ö) is very structured, displaying three relaxation domains, separated by two plateaus. G′′(ö) shows three peaks. We expect that these features can be readily detected through appropriate mechanical relaxation experiments. 1...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a growing}} demand for “tailor-made“ new {{materials}} for special applications, in particular when the reservoir of the presently used raw materials is limited. Conjugated polymers, especially <b>alternating</b> <b>copolymers</b> meet these requirement and can be “tailor-made“ for particular application or processing issues. In this thesis, several conjugated, <b>alternating</b> <b>copolymers</b> with fused ring systems for optoelectronical applications are presented. The mostly used building blocks are benzothiadiazole, benzobis(thiadiazole), cyclopentadithiophene, and indoloindole. <b>Alternating</b> <b>copolymers</b> based on cyclopentadithiophene and benzothiadiazole- or benzobis(thiadiazole) -moieties (with and without additional thiophene “spacers“) are described in Chapter 2 and 3, respectively. Due to the smaller HOMO/LUMO energy gap of benzobis(thiadiazole) compared to benzothiadiazole, the absorption maxima of the corresponding copolymers are bathochromically shifted to wavelengths above 1 000 nm. The benzothiadiazole-based copolymers were tested with different acceptor materials (fullerenes, nanoparticles) in bulk-heterojunction-type organic solar cells. The best power conversion efficiency of ca. 4. 5 % was reached with poly[2, 6 -(4, 4 -bis(2 -ethylhexyl) - 4 H -cyclopenta[2, 1 - b; 3, 4 - b‘]-dithiophene) - alt - 4, 7 -[2, 1, 3]-benzothiadiazole] and C 70 -PCBM as acceptor in the active layer.

40|$|The {{influence}} of backbone composition {{on the physical}} properties of donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers composed of varying amounts of benzodithiophene (BDT) donor with the thienoisoindoledione (TID) acceptor is investigated. First, the synthesis of bis- and tris-BDT monomers is reported; these monomers are subsequently used in Stille copolymerizations to create well-defined alternating polymer structures with repeating (D–A), (D–D–A), and (D–D–D–A) units. For comparison, five semi-random D–A copolymers with a D:A ratio of 1. 5, 2, 3, 4, and 7 were synthesized by reacting trimethyltin-functionalized BDT with various ratios of iodinated BDT and brominated TID. While the HOMO levels of all the resultant polymers are very similar, a systematic red shift in the absorbance spectra onset of the D–A copolymer films from 687 to 883 nm is observed with increasing acceptor content, suggesting the LUMO can be fine-tuned over a range of 0. 4 eV. When the solid-state absorbance spectra of well-defined <b>alternating</b> <b>copolymers</b> are compared to those of semi-random copolymers with analogous D:A ratios, the spectra of the <b>alternating</b> <b>copolymers</b> are significantly more red-shifted. Organic photovoltaic device efficiencies show that the semi-random materials all outperform the well-defined <b>alternating</b> <b>copolymers,</b> and an optimal D:A ratio of 2 produces the highest efficiency. Additional considerations concerning fine-tuning the lifetimes of the photoconductance transients of copolymer:fullerene films measured by time-resolved microwave conductivity are discussed. Overall, {{the results of this}} work indicate that the semi-random approach is a powerful synthetic strategy for fine-tuning the optoelectronic and photophysical properties of D–A materials for a number of systematic studies, especially given the ease with which the D:A ratios in the semi-random copolymers can be tuned. 6 page(s...|$|R
