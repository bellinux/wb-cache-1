Without effective SOA governance, organizations will experience some significant challenges including difficultiesin designing effective decision structures and managing services. To address SOA challenges, organizations require a comprehensive SOA governance framework to implement management and control mechanisms. Study of existing frameworks reveals that these frameworks are not expressive enough to cover all elements of SOA governance and also, they do not completely document underpinning structuressuch as processes, procedures, responsibilities and measurement metrics. In this paper, we propose a new SOA governance framework that is more comprehensive and expressive than its counterparts. In the process of developing the framework, a set of important elements for a desired SOA governance framework is proposed. Based on these elements, a new SOA governance framework is developed. The proposed framework is obtained by extending characteristics of COBIT and applying ITIL service lifecycle activitiesto support the SOA governance principles and requirements.

The company's Department of Information Technology (IT) is collecting huge databases {{of information about the}} information systems (IS), to store performance and <b>activities</b> variables, called <b>metrics.</b> However, their exploitation is under-optimized, because their systematic analysis is not the priority of IT professionals. In this context, we are willing to develop statistical tools, helping IT professionals (i. e. understandable by non-statisticians) {{to take advantage of this}} amount of information. We are particularly interested in two activities of the ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) Capacity Management process: IS monitoring and IS modelling. As the starting point, STMicroelectronics IT Department was manually monitoring a selected set of performance and <b>activities</b> <b>metrics.</b> This was time-consuming and inefficient: only a little part of the IS was under control and many exceptional IS activities were not detected. We implemented a statistical answer, built on a Holt-Winters based monitoring coupled with a robust standard-deviation estimator. This solution is already up and running and allows a fully automated monitoring of several hundred <b>metrics.</b> The modelling <b>activity</b> is aiming at evaluating the interactions between business and IS activities. STMicroelectronics is doing this work by rule of thumb, without any support from a quantified tool. We are currently working on developing such a tool, based on a multivariate statistical analysis of the available metrics. At the present time, we have already identified and quantified some interesting pat- terns, helping at understanding several interactions between the different layers (resource-application- business) of the IS. Beyond the answer to the ITIL process, we are also happy to see that this work really helps at developing a "statistical culture" within the IT Department: brainstorming meetings and presentation of our research results are developing a positive emulation about the use of statistics...|$|R

We explore the use of <b>activity</b> <b>metrics</b> previously introduced and applied to CSCL settings. We argue that these metrics, if adapted in a meaningful way, will provide insight of the progress of a location-based gaming activity and its quality regarding the score. Moreover, we assert that this can be achieved in an automated way. A small set of <b>activity</b> <b>metrics,</b> related to game characteristics and player activity, is applied to a set of gaming activities. The results are analyzed regarding team performance and score. The paper proposes a way to analyze group activity in the context of location-based games while taking into account the characteristics of successful collaborative activities. Future work is proposed towards the development of automated metrics for the analysis of location-based gaming activities with emphasis on collaboration and group dynamics...|$|E

To explore the relationship between conductances, and in particular how they influence the activity of motor neurons in the well characterized leech heartbeat system, we developed a new multi-compartmental Hodgkin-Huxley style leech heart motor neuron model. To do so, we evolved a population of model instances, which differed in the density of specific conductances, capable of achieving specific output activity targets given an associated input pattern. We then examined the sensitivity of measures of output activity to conductances and how the model instances responded to hyperpolarizing current injections. We found that the strengths of many conductances, including those with differing dynamics, had strong partial correlations and that these relationships appeared to be linked by their influence on heart motor neuron activity. Conductances that had positive correlations opposed one another and had the opposite effects on <b>activity</b> <b>metrics</b> when perturbed whereas conductances that had negative correlations could compensate for one another and had similar effects on <b>activity</b> <b>metrics...</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: There is {{a global}} {{interest}} for deploying faculty members′ activities evaluation systems, however implementing a fair and reliable system is a challenging issue. In this study, the authors devised a model for evaluation of faculty members′ activities {{with regard to their}} viewpoints and meta-evaluation standards. Materials and Methods: The reliability of the current faculty members′ <b>activities</b> <b>metrics</b> system was investigated in Medical School of Tehran University of Medical Sciences in 2014. Then authors conducted semi-structured interviews regarding meta-evaluation standards and designed a questionnaire based on interviews′ results which were delivered to faculty members. Finally, they extracted the components of the model regarding interviews′ content analysis and questionnaire′s factor analysis and finalized them in a focus group session with experts. Results: Reliability of the current system was 0. 99 (P < 0. 05). The final model had six dimensions (mission alignment, accuracy, explicit, satisfaction, appropriateness, and constructiveness) derived from factor analysis of the questionnaire and nine factors (consensus, self-reporting, web-based system, evaluation period, minimum expectancies, analysis intervals, verifiers, flexibility, and decision making) obtained via qualitative content analysis of the interviews. Conclusion: In this study, the authors presented a model for faculty members′ activities evaluation based on meta-evaluation of the existing system. The model covered conceptual and executive aspects. Faculty members′ viewpoints were the core component of this model, so it would be acceptable in a medical school to use the model for evaluating their activities...|$|R

This study investigates the effects of consumer activity in online media (paid, owned, and earned) on sales and their interdependencies with the traditional marketing mix elements of price, advertising and distribution. We develop an integrative conceptual framework that links marketing actions to online consumer <b>activity</b> <b>metrics</b> along the consumer’s path to purchase (P 2 P). Our framework proposes that the path to purchase has three basic stages–learning (cognitive), feeling (affective), behavior (conative) —and that these can be measured with novel online consumer <b>activity</b> <b>metrics</b> such as clicking on a paid search ads (cognitive) or Facebook likes and unlikes of the brand (affective). Our empirical analysis of a fast moving consumer good supports a know–feel–do pathway for the low–involvement product studied. We find, for example, that earned media can drive sales. However, we find that the news is not all good as it relates to online consumer activity: higher consumer activity on earned and owned media can lead to consumer disengagement in the form of unlikes. While traditional marketing such as distribution (60 %) and price (20 %) are the main drivers of sales variation for the studied brand, online owned (10 %), (un) earned (3 %), and paid (2 %) media explain a substantial part of the path to purchase. It is noteworthy that TV advertising (5 %) explains significantly less than online media in our case. Overall, our study should help strengthen marketers’ case for building share in consumers’ hearts and minds, as measured through consumer online activity and engagement. Google WP...|$|E
40|$|Quality system {{auditing}} {{has been}} a topic of much recent discussion but {{there has not been}} a commensurate amount of research on how the audit process can make more effective use of auditor time and improve the quality of their judgements. An approach certification bodies and their clients may adopt is to measure the quality system activities of the client, and use these measurements (or metrics) to improve their understand of the quality system. If these metrics were available to auditors, they could identify the strengths and weaknesses of the quality system and assist in deciding if the client complies with ISO 9000. This could make the audit process more cost-effective and focused. A detailed study of the current auditing process used by certification bodies, and a survey of auditors, identified the quality system activities that provide the most confidence that the company has a compliant quality system. The "quality loop" activities of internal audit/management review and corrective action were found to be both the most important activities in showing compliance and provide the basis of metrics that can inform the auditor about the state of health of these <b>activities.</b> <b>Metrics</b> capable of measuring the other quality system activities required by ISO 9000 are identified, and their effectiveness in monitoring the quality system is discussed. The research shows that metrics concerned with the quality loop can provide useful information to an auditor and can help them in reaching a judgement.

40|$|The {{architecture}} of a software product line {{is one of}} its most important artifacts as it represents an abstraction of the products that can be generated. It is crucial to evaluate the quality attributes of a product line architecture in order to: increase the productivity of the product line process {{and the quality of the}} products; provide a means to understand the potential behavior of the products and, consequently, decrease their time to market; and, improve the handling of the product line variability. The evaluation of product line architecture can serve as a basis to analyze the managerial and economical values of a product line for software managers and architects. Most of the current research on the evaluation of product line architecture does not take into account metrics directly obtained from UML models and their variabilities; the metrics used instead are difficult to be applied in general and to be used for quantitative analysis. This paper presents a Systematic Evaluation Method for UML-based Software Product Line Architecture, the SystEM-PLA. SystEM-PLA differs from current research as it provides stakeholders with a means to: (i) estimate and analyze potential products; (ii) use predefined basic UML-based metrics to compose quality attribute metrics; (iii) perform feasibility and trade-off analysis of a product line architecture with respect to its quality attributes; and, (iv) make the evaluation of product line architecture more flexible.
