5|$|Another theory {{states that}} {{chromosomal}} toxin-antitoxin systems <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal. RelE, for example, {{is a global}} inhibitor of translation during nutrient stress, and its expression reduces the chance of starvation by lowering the cell's nutrient requirements. A homologue of mazF toxin called mazF-mx is essential for fruiting body formation in Myxococcus xanthus.|$|E
5|$|Auditory camouflage, {{at least}} in the form of noise reduction, is practised in various ways. The {{rubberized}} hull of military submarines absorbs sonar waves and {{can be seen as a}} form of auditory camouflage. Some modern helicopters <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quiet. Combat uniforms are usually equipped with buttons rather than snap fasteners or velcro to reduce noise.|$|E

5|$|During normal {{passenger}} {{operation on}} revenue tracks, trains <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> controlled by an integrated Automatic Train Operation (ATO) and Automatic Train Control (ATC) system that accelerates and brakes trains automatically without operator intervention. All trains are still manned with train operators who {{open and close}} the doors, make station announcements, and supervise their trains. The system was designed so that an operator could manually operate a train when necessary.|$|E
5|$|LARP {{events have}} {{a wide variety of}} styles that often overlap. Simple distinctions can be made {{regarding}} the genre used, the presence of simulated weapons or abstract rules, and whether players create their own characters or have them assigned by gamemasters. There is also a distinction between scenarios that are only run once and those that <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> repeatable. A number of other common classifications follow.|$|E
5|$|Most {{stations}} on the Bloor–Danforth line have side platforms; however, {{there are}} still a few stations which use a centre platform instead. At the surface, some stations <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a part of the shopping area which are located above the subway. Other stations are large facilities on the surface which also contain bus and/or streetcar platforms to allow transfers to take place.|$|E

5|$|Primary school {{teachers}} are general {{teachers who have}} received their training at either the University of Iceland or the University of Akureyri. The typical course lasts three years. Lower secondary teachers may also be trained at the University of Iceland. A BA or BS degree is required in this situation. The courses <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> both academic and practical. Municipalities {{are responsible for the}} employment of teachers. Optional in-service teacher training courses are offered on an annual basis.|$|E
5|$|The {{objectives}} of the BSA {{are referred to as}} Aims of Scouting: moral character development; citizenship training; and development of physical, mental, and emotional fitness. The BSA pursues these aims through an informal education system called the Scout method, with variations that <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> appropriate for the age and maturity of each membership division. Each unit is sponsored by a community organization as part of their youth program and is involved in the neighborhood and community.|$|E
5|$|These moves <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used in flurry combinations. For instance, {{the player}} can Seismic Slam an opponent, which pulls in enemies, and {{progress}} into a Rising Uppercut, which tosses the opponent into the air. During that toss, the player can charge the Rocket Punch and release as the opponent {{returns to the}} ground. Alternatively, the player can launch into the air, pick an opponent to slam, and punch them at close range. The character is built for aggressive playstyles and advanced players.|$|E

5|$|Bulkers <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> easy {{to build}} and to store cargo efficiently. To {{facilitate}} construction, bulkers are built with a single hull curvature. Also, while a bulbous bow allows a ship to move more efficiently through the water, designers lean towards simple vertical bows on larger ships. Full hulls, with large block coefficients, are almost universal, and as a result, bulkers are inherently slow. This is offset by their efficiency. Comparing a ship's carrying capacity in terms of deadweight tonnage to its weight when empty {{is one way to}} measure its efficiency. A small Handymax ship can carry five times its weight. In larger designs, this efficiency is even more pronounced: Capesize vessels can carry more than eight times their weight.|$|E
5|$|Marvel One-Shots are {{a series}} of direct-to-video short films {{produced}} by Marvel Studios, set within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), released from 2011 to 2014. They are included as special features in the MCU films' Blu-ray and digital distribution releases, but are not included in the DVD releases. Each of the films, which range from 4 to 15 minutes, <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a self-contained story that provides more backstory for characters or events introduced in the films. Two of the shorts have been the inspiration for television series set in the MCU.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from a first-person {{perspective}} and allows the player to undertake a series of assassination missions {{in a variety of}} ways, with an emphasis on player choice. Missions can be completed through stealth, combat, or a combination of both. Exploring each level opens new paths and alternatives for accomplishing mission goals, and it is possible to complete all missions, eliminating all of Corvo's targets, in a non-lethal manner. The story and missions are changed in response to the player's violent actions or lack thereof. Magical abilities and equipment <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> combined to create new and varied effects.|$|E

5|$|Many {{recently}} developed SGDs include performance measurement and analysis tools to help monitor the content used by an individual. This raises concerns about privacy, and {{some argue that}} the device user {{should be involved in}} the decision to monitor use in this way. Similar concerns have been raised regarding the proposals for devices with automatic content generation, and privacy is increasingly a factor in design of SGDs. As AAC devices <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used in all areas of a user’s life, there are sensitive legal, social, and technical issues centred on a wide family of personal data management problems that can be found in contexts of AAC use. For example, SGDs may have to be designed so that they support the user's right to delete logs of conversations or content that has been added automatically.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. also {{increased}} the installation {{and use of}} full-body scanners in many of its major airports {{as a result of}} the attack. The scanners <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to detect bombs under clothing, and 11 airports, including O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, began to receive the machines in March 2010. The TSA said that it had plans to have 1,000 of the machines in airports by the end of 2011. Before, the U.S. had only 40 scanners across 19 airports. The government also said that it planned to buy 300 additional scanners in 2010 and another 500 in the following fiscal year, starting October 2010. It costs around an estimated $530 million to purchase the 500 machines and hire over 5,300 workers to operate them. However, the U.S. government has stated that being scanned is voluntary and that passengers who object to the process could choose to undergo a pat-down search or be searched with hand-held detectors. Under new rules prompted by the incident, airline passengers traveling to the U.S. from 14 nations would undergo extra screening: Afghanistan, Algeria, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The inclusion of non-Muslim Cuba on the list was criticized.|$|E
