There might be a natural entity, as for example {{described}} in the theory of quantum physics, that could adopt a third status between to be or not to be, but it does not belong to the realm of human reasoning. Moreover, the future is not an external natural entity either, thus, the future and all the assumptions about it belong to the realm of human reasoning, where the laws of thought apply. Hence, assumptions regarding the future have to be true or false and cannot be undefined, tertium non datur [4].

40|$|The {{development}} of the Semantic Web (SW) raises a number of difficult and interesting technical issues.

How does technology affect the social networks in which it is embedded? How can technology be successfully transplanted into a new context? And, perhaps most importantly for us, how is technology affected by its context? In particular, I want to look at how our decisions about how we treat knowledge can impact quite dramatically on the technologies we produce.

Questions arise in respect of research conducted by ICT practitioners: (1) What is the context of the IS professional when conducting practitioner-based research; and (2) Does practitioner-based research have a theoretical base and does practitioner-based research challenge the traditional dichotomy between positivist and interpretivist research in IS? An investigation and discussion of these questions in the IS discipline is the objective of this article. In this article, ICT practitioner-based research in organisations is discussed.

Isan (a region of north-eastern Thailand) has been reported as having one of the most rapidly increasing older populations in the country. In order to care for and promote the health of older people, healthcare providers should understand how healthy ageing is perceived by this target group. Although healthy ageing has been studied in different contexts as well as perspectives, no studies have previously focused on older persons’ experiences of healthy ageing from a lifeworld perspective in Isan-Thai.

In view of the progressive concern with more advanced stages, we aim to show that focusing on L 3 initial stages should be one continued priority of the field, even—or especially—if the field is ready to shift towards modeling L 3 development and ultimate attainment. Approach: We argue that L 3 learnability is significantly impacted by initial stages transfer, as such forms {{the basis of the}} initial L 3 interlanguage. To illustrate our point, the insights from studies using initial and intermediary stages L 3 data are discussed in light of developmental predictions that derive from the initial stages models. Conclusions: Despite a shared desire to understand the process of L 3 acquisition in whole, inclusive of offering developmental L 3 theories, we argue that the field does not yet have—although is ever closer to—the data basis needed to effectively do so. Originality: This article seeks to convince the readership for the need of conservatism in L 3 acquisition theory building, whereby offering a framework on how and why we can most effectively build on the accumulated knowledge of the L 3 initial stages in order to make significant, steady progress.

40|$|This {{portfolio}} examines, contextualises and {{evaluates the}} contribution of six selected publications focussed on the social model of disability and discrimination within adult nursing in the UK. The publications all appear in peer reviewed journals and trace a developing understanding of the concept "disability‟, recognition {{of the impact of}} discrimination and the role that nurses play in sustaining this situation. It develops the idea that a shift towards the social model of disability will be instrumental in challenging disability related discrimination. Implications for adult nursing are examined including the potential of social advocacy and the need for a closer relationship between nursing studies and disability studies. The contribution to the knowledge base is unique in the context of adult nursing suggesting that embracing the social model may facilitate a legitimate contribution to the aims of the disability movement. A framework is developed for the evaluation of {{the contribution of}} the submitted papers using the concepts; Model of disability, Interests being served, Non-exploitative approaches and Challenging disablism by extensive dissemination [MINC]. The portfolio draws on many more than the six submitted papers in demonstrating an extensive dissemination strategy.

Contemporary critical theory is drawn on as <b>an</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>base</b> combining critical analysis and reflexivity with empirical procedures. It concludes with tangible links into future developments of this body of work in championing the need for challenging discrimination and the potential use of the social model as a valuable tool in moving towards this goal...|$|R

40|$|International audienceModels and {{modeling}} {{are a major}} issue in science studies and in science education. In addressing such an issue, we first propose <b>an</b> <b>epistemological</b> discussion <b>based</b> on the works of Cartwright (1983, 1999), Fleck (1935 / 1979), and Hacking (1983). This leads us to emphasize the transitions between the abstract and the concrete in the modeling process, by using the notions of nomogical machine (Cartwright, 1999), language game (Wittgenstein, 1953 / 1997), and thought style (Fleck, 1935 / 1979). Then, in the light of our epistemological approach, we study four cases coming from the implementations of research-based design activities (SESAMES, 2007). These four case studies illustrate how students are engaged in constructing relations between the abstract and the concrete through modeling activities, by elaborating at the same time specific language games and appropriate thought styles. Finally, we draw some implications for science teaching. It is suggested that considering didactic nomological machines as embedding knowledge on the one hand, and classes as thought collectives, on the other hand, may relevantly contribute to science education and science education research...|$|R
40|$|School {{principals}} {{are expected}} to play {{a pivotal role in}} enhancing quality teaching and learning in their schools. As leaders of organisations called schools, where teaching and learning take place, they need to possess particular skills to enable them to effectively deliver on their responsibilities of supporting teaching and learning. This means that a school principal is at the centre of any change that must occur at school level. He/she is expected to create a positive learning space by providing a healthy climate for teaching and learning in the school. However, some secondary schools in the King William’s Town Education District are performing far below the national average {{when it comes to the}} Grade 12 results. For this reason, this study sought to explore the views of the school management team members in two such schools on the role of principals as instructional leaders. The case study was premised within the qualitative research approach and the interpretivist paradigm was used as <b>an</b> <b>epistemological</b> <b>base</b> to investigate the views of the school management teams on the role of principals as instructional leaders. Eight school management team members were selected from both schools and the data was collected by means of face-to-face semi-structured interviews and documentary analysis. The data showed that participants had divergent views on how principals play the instructional leadership role. It appeared that principals employed different strategies in supporting teaching and learning in their schools and the focus was on control rather than support. It also emerged from the data that there was a lack of professional support at all levels in the selected schools, and parents were not involved in their children’s academic work. The researcher concludes that there seemed to be no systemic and coherent support strategy focusing on teaching and learning, as there were divergent views on how principals perform their instructional leadership roles. The study therefore recommends that principals be trained on instructional leadership to give them a deeper insight into supporting curriculum implementation in their schools...|$|R

The {{first part of the}} paper introduces shortly principles of feedbacks from cybernetics, especially understanding the behaviours of positive and negative feedbacks. Then, the Activity Theory and related concepts from social autopoietic theory are introduced. The aim of introducing those concepts is to provide the basic elements/components to the construction of a double-loops feedback model in the second part. In the last, the current {{economic crisis}} is interpreted based on the constructed model, to verify the usability of the proposed model. Full text also available at: [URL]...|$|R

Based on, among others, the structure of the interplay between the fiction and the imaginary proposed by Wolfgang Iser (Prospecting, The Fictive and the Imaginary), Ferruccio Masini’s and Eugen Fink’s interpretation of the Nietzsche’s philosophy (founded on the “transfigured dialectic” of play), and Walter Benjamin’s conception of artistic creation influenced by Freud (On some motifs in Baudelaire), my presentation will focus on describing my theoretical approach and point out its originality, after a diachronic description of the “Aristotelian tradition” {{in the history of the}} narratology...|$|R
