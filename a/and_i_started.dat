5|$|Avril {{talked about}} her life and what things were {{important}} to her – she was {{the inspiration for the}} song :-) :-). Matthew began creating the melody and track, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> working on the lyrics. I remember staying in bed for three days, writing 25 versions of the lyric. I love being in bed and writing lyrics, and having my dog Jet and my kitty Dash on the bed. Anyway, we finally finished the lyric, then we completed the demo.|$|E
5|$|I {{remember}} {{being in the}} back part of the studio, and we were sitting there {{late at night and}} writing. I was strolling through some sounds and came upon a particular sound from a steel acoustic guitar. I played these really beautiful chord changes that eventually led to 'My All.' She started singing <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> playing, and we came up with the basis for the song. I put a little drum groove down {{and it was one of}} the easier songs to write with her.|$|E
5|$|Jermaine, Manuel and I {{sat down}} and Jermaine {{programmed}} the drums. I told him the feel I wanted and Manuel {{put his hands on}} the keyboards <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> singing the melody. We went back and forth with the bridge and the B-section. I had the outline of the lyrics and started singing 'Always be my baby' {{off the top of my}} head.|$|E
5000|$|On March 18, 2013, Olivo {{announced}} on her website {{she was taking}} a break from acting, saying [...] "with this knowledge <b>I</b> <b>start</b> a new chapter. I leave behind the actor <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> learning how to be me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Kit. [...] "Tom <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> for Swinset to-morrow to try {{to bring}} them back. But if you'll wait a moment, I'll open the gate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he continued, [...] "we'll go on {{a little}} further. It seems better that I should make what's in my mind quite clear to you. You see, Captain Dampier <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> in a week." ...|$|R
25|$|I {{stopped being}} a hippie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> {{to develop the}} idea of devolution. I got real, real pissed off.|$|E
25|$|I get {{the tune}} and then I {{just keep on}} singing the tune until the words come out from the tune. It's kind of a {{hypnotic}} state that you reach after a while when you keep on playing it where words just evolve from it. So you take those words and just let them go whichever way they want...'Moonshadow'? Funny, that was in Spain, I went there alone, completely alone, {{to get away from}} a few things. And I was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya know, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment that you want to find when you're writin' songs.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{got that}} gun <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> {{shooting}} at Jap planes," [...] Finn {{said in a}} 2009 interview. [...] "I was out there shooting the Jap planes and just every so often I was a target for some," [...] he said, [...] "In some cases, I could see their [...] faces." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, good gracious!" [...] he {{retorted}} quite sharply, [...] "what rubbish next? As if {{the affairs}} of Europe {{were going to be}} arranged by Providence according to whether you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> for an excursion on a Thursday or a Friday!" ...|$|R
50|$|Compton's film {{work is not}} as {{well known}} as her stage appearances. She {{appeared}} in more than forty films between 1914 and 1970. Her most popular performances in films are Odd Man Out (1947), Laughter in Paradise (1951), Orson Welles' Othello (1952), The Haunting (1963) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Start</b> Counting (1969).|$|R
5000|$|The album marked Vangelis' first {{collaboration}} with singer Jon Anderson, who sings on [...] "So Long Ago, So Clear", the closing section of Part One. Vangelis recalls how they [...] "sat down one day <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> {{to play the}} melody and he felt so comfortable that immediately he started to write the words".|$|R
500|$|... 'Don't Forget About Us' was a {{song that}} Jermaine [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> writing and didn't finish, and L.A. Reid heard it. He was excited about it and he was like, 'We should re-release the album. I agreed because {{were trying to figure}} out what to do with the song because we loved it so much, and we didn't want to wait until the next album to send it to radio.|$|E
500|$|During an interview, with Rolling Stone, Mars {{explained}} {{the origin of}} [...] "Moonshine", by saying [...] "We all [...] went out one night, and they had actual moonshine on the menu. We drank it all night, then headed to the studio– Jeff got on keyboards, Mark starts playing electronic drums that sound like Eighties Prince <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> screaming, 'Moonshine, {{take us to the}} stars!' There were a lot of nights like that".|$|E
500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} do {{something}} that had a happy feeling, something that was more open and released, and that's really not Dave. It's very anti what he's about. So he said, 'Oh, {{you want to do that}} happy stuff? All right, all right.' He was not into doing it. Then we started listening to a lot of different and old loops and we used the 'Blind Alley' loop <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> singing the melody over it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "DEAR SIR--One line to {{say that}} your letter has just reached me at my lodging in London. I think I know who sent the strange man to inquire at Allonby. It matters little. Before he finds out his mistake, I shall be at Dumfries. My luggage is packed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> for the North by the next train.|$|R

500|$|When Dylan played Shelton the song, {{shortly after}} {{recording}} it, he claimed, [...] "This {{is the best}} song I've ever written." [...] Around the same time, Dylan enthused to journalist Jules Siegel, [...] "Just listen to that! That's old-time religious carnival music!" [...] However, in 1969, Dylan confessed to Rolling Stones editor, Jann Wenner, [...] "I just sat down at a table and started writing... And I just got carried away with the whole thing... I just started writing and I couldn't stop. After a period of time, I forgot {{what it was all}} about, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> trying {{to get back to the}} beginning [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first two}} {{books in the}} Inheritance Cycle, Eragon and Eldest, sold over 15million copies {{worldwide}} together. Alfred A. Knopf Books for Young Readers, an imprint of Random House Children's Books and {{the publisher of the}} books, prepared Brisingrs release by printing 2.5million copies in advance, Random House's biggest initial print run of a children's book. Paolini said he tried not to let the expectations surrounding Brisingr affect him, stating that [...] "As an author, I found that I can't really allow myself to think about those things. I actually fell into that trap with the first part of Brisingr. I sat there <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> obsessing about every single word." [...] He turned away from his computer and began writing on parchment paper instead. The pages were rewritten on a computer document afterwards by his mother.|$|E
500|$|Israeli actress Hadas Yaron, then aged 20, {{was cast}} {{for the role}} of Shira, the protagonist of the film. She commented that her {{character}} [...] "is much more naïve at 18 than I was when I was 18, and there was something so special about that and it was like going back to the basics". Yaron was unfamiliar with Orthodox practice prior to participating in Fill the Void. In order to become better acquainted with Shira's lifestyle, she started memorizing all of the Hebrew blessings, saying, [...] "There's something so beautiful about it because you're being so grateful all the time for everything you do and hoping that everything works out okay <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> doing those blessings every day and it sounds silly but it helps you feel that you are closer to the character." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have I ever broken my word? I {{promise you}} that the day the Scarlet Pimpernel <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> for France, <b>I</b> will send you that {{imprudent}} letter of his by special courier. More than that, I will pledge you the word of France, that the day I lay hands on that meddlesome Englishman, St. Just will be here in England, safe {{in the arms of}} his charming sister." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{had someone}} build me a guitar, Rick McCurdy as it happens, {{and he made}} me a {{beautiful}} guitar <b>and</b> so <b>I</b> <b>started</b> using it on the concert stage.|$|R
5000|$|I {{imagine the}} story as a moving film or piece of theatre, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> {{building}} the props and setting the scenery around the characters. <b>I</b> love atmosphere, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> guess that's what I wanted to contribute. If I'd been left alone I would have avoided all of the key scenes, I was nervous about dealing with them, but Ben was fantastic in giving the book structure and, thankfully, insisting that I should tackle the explosive, energetic elements of the book.|$|R
500|$|The {{premise of}} Community {{was based on}} Harmon's real-life experiences. In an attempt to save his {{relationship}} with his then-girlfriend, he once enrolled in Glendale Community College, north of Los Angeles, where they would take Spanish together. Harmon got involved in a study group and – somewhat against his own instincts – became closely connected to the group of people with whom he had very little in common. [...] "...I was in this group with these knuckleheads <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> really liking them," [...] he explained, [...] "even though they {{had nothing to do with}} the film industry and I had nothing to gain from them and nothing to offer them." [...] With this as the background, Harmon wrote the show with a main character largely based on himself. He had, like Jeff, been self-centered and independent to the extreme before he realised the value of connecting with other people.|$|E
500|$|... "From This Moment On" [...] {{was written}} during a soccer game in Italy. Twain once explained, “We were in Italy at a soccer game. My husband loves sports. I don’t know {{the game that}} well, so my mind drifted <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> writing.” Initially, Twain thought that [...] "From This Moment On" [...] would be perfect for singer Celine Dion; however, as Twain and Lange {{developed}} the song, they concluded that it would work best as a duet. While their first choice for the duet was Elton John, they chose country singer Bryan White. Twain later described White as [...] "the best male voice in country music. Beyond country music! He's an excellent singer. So {{he needed to be}} on this record, because the song soars. It demands that. It demands dynamics." [...] White explained that, by the time he went to the recording, the song was mostly finalized, and described it as 'extremely challenging' vocally.|$|E
500|$|Following the election, Ann Romney {{received}} {{an offer to}} appear on the spring 2013 season of Dancing with the Stars, but although she was a fan of the show, she declined: [...] "I would've loved to have done it, and I am turning 64, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> thinking about it. I'm not really as flexible as I should be." [...] She still mourned the election loss, perhaps more than her husband did. [...] In a late February 2013 interview, she said, [...] "And you know, the other part of it was an amazing thing, and it was really quite a lot of energy and a lot of passion and a lot of – {{a lot of people around}} us and all of a sudden, it was nothing," [...] then adding, [...] "But the good news is we like each other." [...] In October 2013, she published, and made promotional appearances for, The Romney Family Table: Sharing Home-Cooked Recipes & Favorite Traditions, a cookbook that made the New York Times Best Seller list.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose they}} are getting on all right," [...] she said. [...] "I have done nothing {{for the last two}} days but try them on. You see, we put them out to three milliners, and they all three seem to reach the same point together, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> after breakfast, <b>and</b> it takes about two hours at each place. You don't know what trouble you have given me by hurrying things on so unreasonably." ...|$|R

500|$|Though {{critics have}} pointed out the song's {{similarities}} {{to some of the}} hits by the Police, Mars told MTV News that he did not intend to write anything mimicking by the Sting-fronted band. Instead, it came to him out of the blue, one night during his studio sessions prior to recording the Unorthodox Jukebox album. [...] "I don't think it initially tried to sound like anybody else, but I picked up the guitar and just started playing ," [...] Mars explained. [...] "That's how it normally works; I'll pick up a guitar and I'll start humming a melody, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> singing that, and I was up there in Sting-ville, in that register, so that's what you get...". John Marx, a partner in the music division at William Morris Endeavor (WME), who was responsible for managing the Moonshine Jungle Tour said [...] "it's the type of song that really motivates people to purchase a ticket. It has that live element to it; it was a very active track".|$|E
500|$|In the World Rally Championship, Mouton {{made her}} driver debut in 1974, {{finishing}} 12th in the Tour de Corse in an Alpine A110. It was rumoured her good performances {{were the result}} of a special engine, however her car passed inspection by WRC scrutineers. At the end of the year, Mouton was crowned both French and European ladies' champion. Re-entering the Tour de Corse the following season, she took seventh place. Mouton successfully defended her ladies' titles, and also competed in circuit racing: In an all-female team with Christine Dacremont and Marianne Hoepfner, she won the two-litre prototype category of the 1975 24 Hours of Le Mans. Recalling the race in 2008, Mouton said: [...] "It started to rain I remember, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> to pass everybody. I was running on slicks. In the pits they were saying 'Michele you must stop', but I did not want to because I was passing everyone." [...] Her results attracted a major sponsor {{in the form of the}} French oil company Elf. In 1976, Mouton drove the A110 to 11th place in Monte Carlo and retired at the Rallye Sanremo. At the Tour de Corse, her debut in the newer A310 also ended in retirement.|$|E
500|$|English fantasy author Neil Gaiman guest {{starred in}} the episode as himself, helping Homer and the others write the book. He {{recorded}} his lines in January 2011 in Los Angeles, California {{under the direction of}} Selman. Gaiman has said that when he first agreed to guest star, he assumed he would only be getting a brief appearance, popping up for a few seconds. He told the press that [...] "when they actually sent me the script <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> to read it and discovered that I was in it all the way through and was actually having to act and that stuff happened, it was enormously fun." [...] Gaiman also noted that he does not think the episode gives an entirely accurate portrayal of him, commenting: [...] "Truthfully, the real-life me almost never hangs around in Barnes & Noble-like bookstores waiting to find groups of local townsfolk who've decided to write pseudonymous young adult fantasy series, offering my services. And even if I did, I probably wouldn't be doing the catering." [...] On his official Tumblr page, Gaiman noted that while he did not have much input on the story, he got to improvise while recording and gave suggestions on how to make his dialogue sound as close to something he might actually say in real life.|$|E
