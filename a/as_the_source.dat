This prior information suggests that to detect and locate forced oscillations, one may want to place more attentions on the generation sides.|$|R

5|$|A long-standing {{problem in}} {{astronomy}} {{has been the}} identification of supernova progenitors. Direct observation of a progenitor would provide useful constraints on supernova models.

Previous observations with the Hubble Space Telescope did not show a star at {{the position of the}} event, thereby excluding a red giant <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>source.</b> The expanding plasma from the explosion was found to contain carbon and oxygen, making it likely the progenitor was a white dwarf primarily composed of these elements.|$|E
