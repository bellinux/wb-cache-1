50|$|The {{linearity}} of {{the bump}} steer curve {{is important and}} relies {{on the relationship of}} the control arms and tie rod pickup points, and the length of each part. As the suspension goes through bump and droop, each part follows an arc resulting in a change of effective length. Whichever parts are longest tend to have less change in effective length because their <b>arc</b> <b>radius</b> is longer. This is the determining factor in designed bump steer. Another factor that affects bump steer is bushing compliance and deflection and arm bending. During a turn, if {{some or all of the}} bushings deflect then their pickup points have changed If any of the arms and tie rods bend then their effective length will change resulting in a change of toe.|$|E

The model is separated into a pre-breakdown kinetic model and a post-breakdown fluid model. The kinetic model is used to simulate streamer formation, and the fluid model is used to simulate the behavior of the conducting arc. Intrinsic switch parameters that were varied in the kinetic model included electric field, gas pressure and gas type. Laser triggering parameters varied included spot shape, spot area, and laser power. Parameters varied in the fluid model were the initial <b>arc</b> <b>radius,</b> arc conductivity, and gas density. Initial <b>arc</b> <b>radius</b> and conductivity for the fluid model are found from the end result of the kinetic model. The goal was to evaluate parameters to discover their effects on the resistive fall time of the switch. Increasing the initial <b>arc</b> <b>radius</b> and conductivity were a large factor in decreasing the resistive fall time.

However, this paper proposes a kind of curvilinear tooth gear which is processed by a parallel linkage with a single blade cutter. For the purpose of identifying the meshing and contact characteristics of curvilinear tooth gears, the paper covers the following: (i) equations of tooth surfaces are deduced from the meshing theory, and a parameterized geometric model is developed by applying computer graphics; (ii) an investigation into meshing characteristics for an ideal assembly condition is performed, and an instantaneous contact curve is obtained from the developed tooth contact algorithm; (iii) based on {{the application of the}} finite element method, the evolution of contact and bending stresses during the cycle of meshing and between different <b>arc</b> <b>radii</b> of the curvilinear tooth is illustrated by numerical examples.

In order to analyze the relation between rock-breaking energy consumption and bit crown shape quantificationally, the paper puts forward an idea to take “per revolution-specific rock-breaking work” as objective function, and analyzes the relationship between rock properties, inner cone angle, outer cone <b>arc</b> <b>radius,</b> and per revolution-specific rock-breaking work by means of explicit dynamic finite element method. Results show that the change law between per revolution-specific rock-breaking work and the radius of gyration is similar for rocks with different properties, it is beneficial to decrease rock-breaking energy consumption by decreasing inner cone angle or outer cone <b>arc</b> <b>radius.</b> Of course, we should also consider hydraulic structure and processing technology in the optimization design of PDC bit crown.|$|E
