40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{probe the}} effects of {{acupuncture}} reinforcing <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> methods on the human body. MethodsStudied acupuncture reinforcing <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> actions in the ancient literature, based on modern clinical and experimental studies, in combination with experience of acupuncture teaching and clinical treatment. ResultsThe key to the generation of reinforcing <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> actions is not the acupuncture reinforcing <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> methods themselves, but instead the functional state of the patient during the acupuncture. When reinforcing <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> methods act on the human body, a reinforcing-reducing effect is produced through regulation of Qi, indicating that {{the production of the}} reinforcing-reducing effect requires a certain condition. Specifically, acupuncture does not produce the reinforcing-reducing effect under all conditions, but can produce a reinforcing effect in patients with deficiency syndrome <b>and</b> a <b>reducing</b> effect in patients with excess syndrome. ConclusionReinforcing <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> methods each have therapeutic effects on both deficiency syndrome and excess syndrome, but a reinforcing method should be selected first for deficiency syndrome <b>and</b> a <b>reducing</b> method should be selected first for excess syndrome...|$|R

In controlled experiments, artificial moon-like illumination stimulates similar responses in their foraging behavior, suggesting that this behavior has evolved to reduce predation risk.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{uncommon in}} people who smoke, {{and there is also}} a correlation between habit duration and severity of the condition. Tobacco use is associated with an increase in keratinization of the oral mucosa. In extreme forms, this may manifest as leukoplakia or stomatitis nicotina (smoker's keratosis). This increased keratinization may mechanically reinforce the mucosa <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> the tendency of ulcers to form after minor trauma, or present a more substantial barrier to microbes and antigens, but this is unclear. Nicotine is also known to stimulate production of adrenal steroids <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> production of TNF-α, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. Smokeless tobacco products also seem to protect against aphthous stomatitis. Cessation of smoking is known to sometimes precede the onset of aphthous stomatitis in people previously unaffected, or exacerbate the condition in those who were already experiencing aphthous ulceration. Despite this correlation, starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A new {{mechanism}} of saving energy <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> pollution is brought forward by analyzing water characters in high temperature condition and all factors which bring saving energy <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> {{pollution in the}} combustion process of emulsification oil. The theory shows that the reason of saving energy <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> pollution is that emulsification oil can reduce surplus air ratio effectively in the combustion process. These reasons include that of improving the burning flame temperature, avoiding the local super-high temperature, decreasing the amount of NOX and the conversion of SO 2 oxidize to SO 3, strengthening the burning and heat transmission <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> the soot of the flue gas. By this new theory, the reasons of saving energy <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> pollution in the combustion process of emulsification gasoline, emulsification diesel oil, emulsification heavy oil and other slurry fuel of W/O or O/W can be well explained. At the same time, the new mechanism was well validated in the combustion process of hard asphalt water slurry...|$|R

5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle compartment <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> the risk of compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E
