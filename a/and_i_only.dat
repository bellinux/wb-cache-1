5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it. At first I got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E

She once attended a Catholic school, {{though she was}} raised as a Buddhist. She has recalled some portions of her childhood as [...] "painful", explaining that [...] "I loved my father very much <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> got to see him during the school holidays. But I {{think it was an}} advantage that they split up when I was very young, so I could get used to it." [...] She visited her father in Falsterbo, Sweden, during school breaks and talked to him regularly over the phone. She cites her parents as [...] "supportive, positive influences" [...] in her life.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the podium}} ceremony, {{in which two}} Brazilian drivers participated {{for the first time}} since the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix, the top three {{finishers}} appeared in the obligatory press conference. Hamilton said that the decision to not make a pit stop during the safety car period was the team's decision: [...] "We had two very comfortable, two very decent stints and the team opted for me to stay out. I guess they thought I could pull out a gap but it was a 23 second gap I needed <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> had seven laps or something, so I don't know how that worked out." [...] Hamilton added that he felt that things looked good for the rest of the season, stating that [...] "if we [...] can continue with this momentum we have got we are looking very good".|$|E

500|$|John Metcalf for The Spectator {{thought the}} book [...] "utterly disgraceful—and highly enjoyable... without [...] no {{forthcoming}} railway journey should be undertaken", although he also considered {{that it was}} [...] "not one of Mr. Fleming's best". Anthony Boucher, writing in The New York Times, was equivocal, saying [...] "I don't know anyone who writes about gambling more vividly than Fleming <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> wish {{the other parts of}} his books lived up to their gambling sequences". Richard Lister in the New Statesman thought that [...] "Mr. Fleming is splendid; he stops at nothing." [...] Writing for The Washington Post, Al Manola believed that the [...] "British tradition of rich mystery writing, copious description and sturdy heroism all blend nicely" [...] in Moonraker, providing what he considered was [...] "probably the best action novel of the month".|$|E
500|$|As many expected, {{the highly}} {{anticipated}} domestic clash was a savage brawl from round one. Gomez won the opening rounds {{and threatened to}} overpower Johanneson from the opening seconds. The Leeds fighter then gained the upper hand as the fight went on, flooring Gomez in the sixth round only for the [...] "Irish Mexican" [...] {{to rise from the}} canvas. Soon after, with Gomez appearing unsteady on his feet, referee Mickey Vann stopped the fight. Gomez said that Vann had stopped the fight early, adding, [...] "When the stoppage came, I wasn't wobbling or staggering, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> dropped my hands in the fight to show Johanneson that he couldn't hurt me. But the referee simply got the wrong message. It was bad refereeing. I told him straight away I was fine, but he insisted on showing me to my corner." [...] The former champion was clear that he wanted another opportunity to fight for the British title.|$|E
500|$|The storyline was criticised by {{some former}} Coronation Street cast members, who {{believed}} the producers {{were using the}} subject of rape to gain higher ratings than rival soap opera EastEnders. Taylor defended the storyline and hoped that it would help other {{women who had been}} attacked to seek help. She stated [...] "The main focus of the storyline is the psychological effect that the attack has on Toyah. There are many women out there who have been raped or sexually assaulted and we owe it to them {{to make sure that the}} story-line is handled sensitively and accurately. There is no denying that rape is a sensitive and controversial storyline. But I have put my heart and soul into it trying to portray it accurately <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> hope that women who have experienced it will think I have given it justice." [...] A show spokesperson commented that the storyline would be [...] "handled sensitively" [...] and that it would not become [...] "a whodunnit". Some of the male residents came under suspicion and were forced to give DNA samples. Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) briefly became the prime suspect, but DNA soon eliminated him from enquires.|$|E

500|$|Two riders very {{disappointed}} with their results were Michael Matthews and Fabian Cancellara. Matthews crashed {{at high speed}} shortly before the Cipressa and arrived at the finish with a bandaged right elbow. He said: [...] "Obviously I'm devastated. [...] This was everything, this was my world championships {{for the start of}} the season. [...] I was really looking forward to making a good finale, it's really unfortunate that a crash stopped me from doing that." [...] Cancellara, who was riding the event for the last time before retirement at the end of the 2016 season, was held up in Gaviria's crash after having stayed in the leading group. He described his final kilometres as difficult, as he had been isolated from his teammates, saying that the other riders mainly attacked him and did not work with him. Another rider who was almost involved when Gaviria fell was Peter Sagan, who confirmed that the peloton had covered Cancellara in particular. He went on to describe the moment of Gaviria's crash: [...] "Then I got away with Boasson Hagen, Gaviria and someone else. Then with about 500 metres to go, Gaviria looked around because the group was coming up. He went down <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> just managed to avoid him. I stayed up but I lost a lot speed and never managed to get going again in the final metres." ...|$|E

I only accepted the job because of Mijatović, who is currently the football director at Real".|$|E

2500|$|After {{the main}} filming over 1967–68 in India and the United States, {{financial}} and technical problems interrupted production on Raga. According to Worth's recollection, the original financier for the project, whom {{he describes as}} [...] "Ravi's manager", was forced to back out, having been committed to a psychiatric ward. In Raga Mala, Shankar says that he financed the film himself, adding: [...] "which was rather sad because it cost a large amount <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> realised this later!" ...|$|E

On several occasions when the Congress seemed to disagree with Gandhi on policy, Bacha Khan remained his staunchest ally. In 1931 the Congress offered him {{the presidency of the}} party, but he refused saying, [...] "I am a simple soldier and Khudai Khidmatgar, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> want to serve." [...] He remained a member of the Congress Working Committee for many years, resigning only in 1939 because of his differences with the Party's War Policy. He rejoined the Congress Party when the War Policy was revised.|$|E

2500|$|Late that year, an {{incident}} involving Xu Yushi's son Xu Ziran (許自然) {{would lead to}} Xu Yushi's removal. [...] Xu Ziran, {{who was in charge}} of imperial wagons, had gone out on a hunt, and during the hunt, he had damaged a farmer's crops. [...] When the farmer became angry, Xu Ziran fired arrows toward the farmer. [...] Xu Yushi caned Xu Ziran 100 times, but did not report this to the emperor. [...] When the farmer submitted a formal accusation, the accusation was initially put aside by the official Yang Deyi (楊德裔), but another official, Yuan Gongyu (袁公瑜), then resubmitted the accusation directly to the emperor under a pseudonym. [...] Emperor Gaozong, in anger, stated, [...] "Xu Yushi is a chancellor, but when the people's lives and properties were interfered with, he did not report to me. [...] Is this not an abuse of power?" [...] Xu responded, [...] "I serve in a key position of the government, and I serve Your Imperial Majesty with honesty and fairness, and I could not please everyone. [...] That is why I am being attacked. [...] As for abusing power, only someone who commands strong troops or is stationed at a key military post can do so. [...] I am but a civilian who serves the emperor, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> know how to perfect myself behind closed doors. [...] How can I abuse power?" [...] This caused Emperor Gaozong to be angrier, and he stated, [...] "Are you displeased that you do not command troops?" [...] Another chancellor, Xu Jingzong, who happened to be present, stated, [...] "For an imperial subject to have this kind of attitude, death would be too good of a treatment for him!" [...] Emperor Gaozong ordered that Xu Yushi be expelled from his presence and removed from his post.|$|E
