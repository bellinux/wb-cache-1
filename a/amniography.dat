40|$|Historical {{and ethical}} aspects of direct {{treatment}} of the fetus J. W. DUDENHAUSEN During the last 2 O to 25 years perinatal medicine has developed significantly, and the main points of interest have been the diagnosis of {{the well-being of the}} fetus. There were only some new aspects in treatment. For in-stance the RH disease and the intrauterine blood trans-fusion. But the main stream of all the scientific in-vestigations was concerned with diagnostic problems. The technical development of sonography, fetoscopy, amnio-centesis, <b>amniography</b> and fluid collection enable us to make a prenatal diagnosis of the defects of the fetus. And with these diagnostic possibilities we stand today on the brink of an age when direct therapy of the fetu...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Thyroid {{hyperplasia}} {{was identified}} at necropsy in 16 of 70 cases of haemolytic {{disease of the}} newborn due to rhesus isoimmunisation dying in the years 1959 - 76. No hyperplasia {{was found in the}} thyroids from 140 nonrhesus-affected infants matched for date of birth, bodyweight and length, and gestation, or in cases of haemolytic disease born before 1966. All 16 infants with thyroid hyperplasia had received intrauterine transfusions and the iodine-containing contrast media used for preliminary <b>amniography</b> were the only goitrogenic factors identified. Lipiodol, first used in 1966, was considered to have the greatest effect. The 16 infants with hyperplastic thyroids were less mature and smaller than 22 infants with normal thyroids who had been similarly exposed to contrast media. The high incidence of hyperplasia may be due to immaturity of the adaptive mechanisms which allow most normal individuals to escape the goitrogenic effects ofiodine compounds. In a preliminary report in 1976 we described the finding of hyperplasia of the thyroid glands in some infants with haemolytic disease due to rhesus isoimmunisation. 1 Thyroid hyperplasia had not previously been described in association with thi...|$|E
