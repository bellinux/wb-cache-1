We studied a total of 200 patients, including 62 patients with schistocytosis, 8 postsplenectomy patients, and 108 healthy controls. Peripheral blood (2 µl) was stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated (PE) antihemoglobin antibody (<b>anti-Hb)</b> in 0. 6 % (w/v) NaCl solution, and analyzed by flow cytometry omitting the washing step. The proportion of RBCs stained by <b>anti-Hb</b> was 0. 55 % (SD ± 0. 23 %) in normal controls and was significantly higher in patients with schistocytosis (2. 95 ± 2. 95 %, p mean+ 2 SD of normal controls). The number of schistocytes counted by microscopic examination correlated with the proportion of RBCs stained by <b>anti-Hb</b> (r = 0. 637, p < 0. 001). The proportions of stained RBCs in blood samples with malaria, spherocytosis, and elliptocytosis were also significantly higher than in normal controls.

40|$|A {{total of}} 1, 270 nursing {{students}} of Nagasaki University School of Health Sciences were examined for serum HBsAg and <b>anti-HBs</b> {{at their first}} year between 1990 and 2006. The prevalence of HBsAg was 0. 39 % (5 / 1, 270); 0. 52 % (4 / 762) in 1990 - 1999, 0. 27 % (1 / 368) in 2000 - 2004, and 0 % (0 / 140) in 2005 - 2006. The prevalence of <b>anti-HBs</b> was 1. 81 % (23 / 1, 270); 1. 97 % (15 / 762) in 1990 - 1999, 0. 82 % (3 / 368) in 2000 - 2004, and 3. 57 % (5 / 140) in 2005 - 2006. A total of 650 students who were negative for HBsAg and <b>anti-HBs</b> in 1998 - 2006 received a primary series of hepatitis B vaccinations. Subsequently, 98. 2 % (638 / 650) acquired <b>anti-HBs.</b> The median titer of <b>anti-HBs</b> concentrations at 4 weeks after primary vaccination was 2, 145. 0 mIU/mL. Eleven among 12 {{students who did not}} acquire <b>anti-HBs</b> after a primary vaccination received a second series of vaccinations, after which eight (72. 7 %) acquired <b>anti-HBs.</b> Overall 99. 4 % (646 / 650) of the students vaccinated acquired <b>anti-HBs.</b> Among 286 students who acquired <b>anti-HBs</b> after the primary series of vaccinations, 17 (5. 9 %) became negative for <b>anti-HBs</b> in their third year. Nursing students should be educated about the risks for and prevention of blood borne infections, including the need to be vaccinated against hepatitis B. Moreover, nursing students who do not acquire <b>anti-HBs</b> after primary vaccination should receive a 3 -dose revaccination series...|$|E
40|$|A 27 {{year old}} white female is 20 weeks pregnant. During a {{prenatal}} visit, her liver enzymes were normal but her hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis e antigen was positive. HBV DNA levels are detectable at 10, 000 IU/ml. What strategy is recommended to best {{reduce the risk}} of vertical transmission? A. Vaccinate the mother now. B. Vaccinate the infant at the time of birth. C. Give Hepatitis B immune globulin and vaccinate the infant at the time of birth. D. Treat the mother with lamivudine now. E. Treat the mother with entecavir now. Answer: C Infants born to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected mothers are at high risk of acquiring HBV infection themselves, particularly if the mother has a high level of HBV DNA and hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) in her plasma. Without intervention the risk of transmission from an HBeAg seropositive mother is 70 %- 90 % compared with the risk of about 10 % from an HBeAg negative mother(1, 2).

40|$|The risk of {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) trans-mission by transfusion in sub-Saharan Africa {{is considered to}} be relatively low, and testing of blood donors is often not done or is done relatively poorly. To re-examine this attitude, we identified HBV chronically infected blood donors from a major hospital in Ghana with a range {{of hepatitis}} B surface antigen (HBsAg) as-says. Test efficacy was estimated using HBV DNA as a gold standard, and the risk of HBV infection in blood recipients was estimated for different testing strategies. Particle agglutination, dipstick, and en-zyme immunoassay (EIA) HBsAg screen-ing detected 54 %, 71 %, and 97 % of HBV infectious donors, respectively. The risk of HBV transmission to recipients less than 10 years old ranged between 1 : 11 and 1 : 326 with blood unscreened and screened by EIA, respectively. For older recipients, the risk decreased a further 4 -fold because of the high frequency of natural exposure to HBV. A total of 98 % of HBsAg-confirmed positive samples con-tained HBV DNA. HBV DNA load was less than 1 104 IU/mL in 75 % of HBsAg-reactive samples, most of them <b>anti-HB...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{recombinant}} {{surface antigen}} of hepatitis B virus (HBsAg), purified from transgenic plants, {{proved to be}} efficient when utilized for raising <b>anti-HB</b> antibodies {{for the prevention of}} hepatitis B. Because of the important role of the HBsAg antigen in hepatitis B prevention, the coding sequence of HBsAg antigen, with or without the addition of the carboxi-terminus sequence for protein retention in the endoplasmatic reticulum, was linked to cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter, tobacco mosaic virus leader sequence Ω, and the transcription terminator sequence. The aim of this work was to clone the chimeric gene 35 SHBsAgER in the plant expression vector pGPTV/Kan/Asc. The resulting plasmid, called pG 35 SHBsAgER, and another plasmid produced previously in our laboratory called pG 35 SHBsAg, were transferred to Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and tobacco leaves, of the SR 1 cultivar were used as explants for genetic transformation. Twenty-one fully regenerated plants were obtained (10 for the pG 35 SHBsAg construction and 11 for the pG 35 SHBsAgER construction). The genomic DNA of all plants was analyzed by PCR, and the presence of the transgene was confirmed in all plants...|$|R
