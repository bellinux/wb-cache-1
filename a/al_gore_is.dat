500|$|Back in {{the present}} day, Peter discovers that his past actions have had drastic effects on the world: he and Molly {{have been married for}} 20 years; Judd Nelson crashes at their house once or twice a week; Lois is married to Quagmire; <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> <b>is</b> now the President of the United States; Chris, Meg, and Stewie have Quagmire's chin, nose, and mannerisms; and Chevy Chase is the host of The Tonight Show. Brian {{explains}} to Peter that by missing out on his date with Lois and making out with Molly, he altered the time line. Despite Brian's objections about leaving the [...] "perfect" [...] world (in which there are flying cars that run on vegetable oil and Gore has killed Osama bin Laden by strangling him with his bare hands), Peter wants {{to go back to the}} past so he can undo his mistake. Brian says that this is impossible because Death can only be summoned if someone dies and thanks to Gore's universal health care, people are living much longer along with a strong, well-funded educational system and zero tolerance gun control that has eliminated street crime. However, when Jane Jetson suddenly falls on the sidewalk and dies, Death arrives and again grants Peter's wish to return to the past. Back in the past, Peter is determined to accept Lois' invitation but repeatedly blows his opportunity and ends up repeatedly asking Death for a do-over. When Peter finally gets it right, he forgets a few hours later and parties with Cleveland instead of keeping the date. He asks Death for another chance but Death, fed up with Peter's continued blunders, tells him that he will have to fix the problem on his own.|$|E

500|$|The Back to the Future trilogy is parodied and {{referenced}} {{throughout the}} episode, {{along with many}} other movies and famous people throughout the 1980s. Other cultural references include how after going back in time, Peter becomes excited about his new prospects in life, and states to Cleveland {{that he is going to}} [...] "raise more hell than Hellraiser" [...] from the 1987 horror film Hellraiser. It also depicts Pinhead as weak and ridiculous, stating that the worst he can do is unscrew a salt shaker and trick someone into using it, causing salt to come out all over their food. The first scene where Lois appears at the swimming pool is a reference to a scene from the 1980 film Caddyshack, featuring the song [...] "Mr. Night" [...] by Kenny Loggins. Once Lois appears, she asks Peter if he would like to see the 1982 film Zapped!. Rejecting her offer, Peter decides to go partying with Cleveland instead and play the video game Menstrual Ms. Pac-Man, in addition to making out with actress Molly Ringwald. While there, Brian gets into a fight, and instructs the bar patron to meet him on top of the World Trade Center to fight him at eight A.M. on September 11, 2001. While downstairs in the alternate universe, Peter makes a reference to the Twilight Zone episode, [...] "The Eye of the Beholder." [...] The joke about the World Trade Center has been edited from current versions of the show accessible on Netflix as of January 2012. Returning to the present, Peter and Brian decide to watch television, and are shocked to discover that actor Chevy Chase is now the host of The Tonight Show. They also discover that former Vice President <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> <b>is</b> now President of the United States, and flying cars running on vegetable oil exist. A parody of the 1962 ABC animated series, Hanna-Barbera's The Jetsons, is then shown. In the alternate reality, Death refers to the Dick Cheney hunting accident, explaining that the [...] "Chairman of Halliburton" [...] accidentally shot and killed Karl Rove, Antonin Scalia, and Tucker Carlson (Brian groans that Peter and he can't change this wonderful future, but Peter flatly says [...] "I don't know who any of those people are"). The main plot of the episode, complete with the scene in which Peter and Brian are in the living room, with Brian explaining to Peter what happened using a chalk board, is a reference to the alternate universe scene in Back to the Future Part II.|$|E

2500|$|Former Vice President of the United States and {{prominent}} environmentalist <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> <b>is</b> a recurring guest star, {{due in part}} to his daughter Kristin Gore's involvement in the show as a staff writer and story editor. He has appeared as himself in story segments set in the early 21st century ("Anthology of Interest I" [...] and Bender's Big Score) and as his own head in a jar in the 31st century ("Crimes of the Hot" [...] and Bender's Big Score).
