5|$|In European Salamandridae, {{albinism}} {{has been}} recorded in the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra), gold-striped salamander (Chioglossa lusitanica), Italian crested newt (Triturus carnifex), marbled newt (Triturus marmoratus), Iberian ribbed newt (Pleurodeles waltl), <b>alpine</b> <b>newt</b> (Ichthyosaura alpestris) and two sub-species of the smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris vulgaris and Lissotriton vulgaris meridionalis).|$|E
5|$|Triturus {{included}} most European newt species {{until the}} end of the 20th century, but was substantially revised after it was shown to be polyphyletic. Three separate genera now accommodate former members of the genus: the small-bodied newts (Lissotriton), the banded newts (Ommatotriton), and the <b>alpine</b> <b>newt</b> (Ichthyosaura). The monophyly of the genus Triturus in the strict sense is supported by molecular data and synapomorphies such as a genetic defect causing 50% embryo mortality (see below, Egg deposition and development).|$|E
5|$|The aquatic {{habitats}} {{preferred by}} the newts are stagnant, mid- to large-sized, unshaded water bodies with abundant underwater vegetation but without fish, which prey on larvae. Typical examples are larger ponds, which {{need not be}} of natural origin; indeed, most ponds inhabited by the northern crested newt in the UK are human-made. Examples of other suitable secondary habitats are ditches, channels, gravel pit lakes, garden ponds, or (in the Italian crested newt) rice paddies. The Danube crested newt is more adapted to flowing water and often breeds in river margins, oxbow lakes or flooded marshland, where it frequently co-occurs with fish. Other newts {{that can be found}} in syntopy with Triturus species include the smooth, the palmate, the Carpathian, and the <b>alpine</b> <b>newt.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Alpine</b> <b>newts</b> {{typically}} inhabit forests {{with good}} {{access to water}} in hilly to mountainous regions. They are mostly absent in forest-poor areas. They populate well in thick deciduous forests, as well as parkland and natural gardens. Outside the spawning season, <b>Alpine</b> <b>newts</b> live terrestrially. During the day it then stays {{in all kinds of}} undergrowth. After the adults come out of winter dormancy, they migrate to their spawning pools (forest pools, artificial pools) and live the mating season in cool water.|$|R

40|$|In June 2004 and June 2005, {{we checked}} 40 and 134 ponds {{respectively}} for alive and dead <b>alpine</b> <b>newts,</b> common toads, common frogs, and their clutches on the "Kirchfeld" plateau in the Northern Limestone Alps of Austria. We found several hundred dead common frogs and <b>alpine</b> <b>newts</b> {{in the two}} consecutive years and also observed an unusually high number of heterospecific matings between common toads and common frogs in 2004. In order to test whether the observed mortalities were caused by disease, we screened 98 individuals of the three species for chytridiomycosis, a highly infective fungal disease, in 2008. All samples proved to be negative. We therefore assume that the high losses for the common frog population (26 % in 2004 and 9 % in 2005) during the spring migration, {{as well as the}} breakdown of the temporal premating isolation between the common frog and common toad, were caused by temperature anomalies alone, i. e. sudden low temperatures after a warm spring period. The high number of dead <b>alpine</b> <b>newts</b> found in 2005 was negatively correlated to the oxygen saturation of the ponds, frequently covered by ice during the early breeding season. We discuss the possible effects of climate change on phenological timing, breeding isolation and chytridiomycosis in alpine amphibian populations...|$|R

5|$|Historically, most European newts were {{included}} in the genus, but taxonomists have split off the <b>alpine</b> <b>newts</b> (Ichthyosaura), the small-bodied newts (Lissotriton) and the banded newts (Ommatotriton) as separate genera. The closest relatives of Triturus are the European brook newts (Calotriton).

Their ranges are largely contiguous but where they do overlap, hybridisation may take place.|$|R
40|$|The usual {{life cycle}} of <b>Alpine</b> <b>newts</b> {{comprises}} an aquatic larval stage and a terrestrial juvenile and adult stage. However, some populations differ from this pattern in exhibiting facultative paedomorphosis where some individuals reach sexual maturity while retaining larval traits such as gills and gill slits. While paedomorphic newts can, in some circumstances, initiate metamorphosis, once a newt has commenced metamorphosis, the state is irreversible. Because the frequency of this switching from one morph to the other has never been quantified in the wild, we attempted to estimate switching rate and survival by carrying out a 3 -year monitoring survey of a population inhabiting an alpine lake. While morph switching did occur in this population, it involved a relatively low proportion of the paedomorphs (approx. 12 %), suggesting that metamorphosis is not favoured in the study population. The hypothesis of paedomorphic advantage was not supported since neither survival nor body condition differed between morphs. The ontogenetic pathway of wild <b>Alpine</b> <b>newts</b> is thus characterised by two forks in the developmental pathway. The first occurs during the larval stage (metamorphosis vs. paedomorphosis), and the second occurs in paedomorphic adults (switching for metamorphosis vs. continuation of the paedomorphic lifestyle).

40|$|Facultative paedomorphis is a {{developmental}} {{process in which}} larvae opt for metamorphosis before maturity or reach sexual maturity while retaining larval traits (e. g., gills). Although metamorphosis is not reversible, the paedomorphic state is not a dead end as branchiate adults are able to metamorphose. However, the extent of this process has never been quantified in the wild. Our aim was then to estimate switching rate by carrying out a 3 -year monitoring survey of a population of <b>Alpine</b> <b>newts</b> (Triturus alpestris) inhabiting an alpine lake. The data were analysed using a multi-state capture-recapture model. While morph switching did occur in this population, it involved only 12 % of the paedomorphs each year (i. e., 17 % of recaptured individuals), suggesting that metamorphosis was not favoured in this population during the study period. This rate is lower than in laboratory experiments during which newts from the same population were placed in water drying conditions, but as shown previously paedomorphs can avoid metamorphosis in migrating to permanent water bodies when their pond dries out. These results are in agreement with other studies showing an advantage of a dimorphism in heterogeneous habitats. The ontogenetic pathway of wild <b>Alpine</b> <b>newts</b> is thus characterised by two forks in the developmental pathway. The first occurs during the larval stage, and the second occurs in paedomorphic adults. Such a two-level decision process may allow individuals to cope with environmental uncertainty.

The aim {{of this study was to}} find out whether heterochronic morphs occupy particular micro-habitats and focus on specific prey items. Resource partitioning was found between morphs. It concerns mainly food selection with paedomorphs preying more on plankton and less on terrestrial invertebrates than metamorphs. Some habitat specializations were also found with metamorphs being more abundant at the water surface than paedomorphs. Diel variation in habitat use of the two different morphs was minimal. Polymorphism allows <b>Alpine</b> <b>newts</b> to exploit the different resources in the lakes in order to minimize intraspecific competition, but the extent of resource partitioning depends on habitat characteristics.

40|$|Evolutionary theory {{assumes that}} facultative paedomorphosis in newts and {{salamanders}} is adaptive in allowing either a younger age at maturity or resource partitioning between the heterochronic morphs. In newt populations that only take the metamorphic ontogenetic pathway, juveniles are terrestrial and avoid food competition with larvae and breeding adults. In contrast, in populations where paedomorphosis occurs, branchiate newts of all sizes coexist in the aquatic habitats, posing {{the question of whether}} intramorph competition exists and its relationship with the evolution of paedomorphosis. We studied size-related predation in such a size-structured community of branchiate <b>Alpine</b> <b>newts</b> (Triturus alpestris) inhabiting a deep alpine lake. Although gape limitation may explain such size-related predation, individuals also exhibited selectivity according to prey size. Amongst small prey that were within the capture range of all newt size classes, smaller newts preyed on smaller items than did larger ones. We assume that such decisions favour the coexistence of different-sized individuals. It is suspected that such size-selective predation on items which are avoided by water-living metamorphs allows the maintenance of facultative paedomorphosis, in favouring resource partitioning between morphs.
