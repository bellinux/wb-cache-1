25|$|Michael Parkinson always sought guests who, {{besides being}} well known, {{had some sort}} of story to relate. He then saw his job as {{allowing}} them to tell it and did so by being open, relaxed and attentive. (He learnt very early on that in order to be an adept interviewer, he had to be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>listener.)</b> He researched his subjects thoroughly, and, in the early shows, always had his list of questions to hand. Having guided them to an area of discussion, he rarely interrupted his guests — except to provide the occasional prompt — instead letting them expand on a particular topic. Sometimes, a person would warm to this style with unpredictable results. For example, he regards his chats with Shirley MacLaine as bordering on flirtatious. In his final programme, broadcast 22 December 2007, Parkinson stated that one of his most memorable interviews was with Jacob Bronowski in 1973.|$|E
25|$|When he was 11 years old, Plenty Coups had {{a second}} vision {{involving}} the Little People, one that changed the fate of his entire tribe. Plenty Coups' family had moved to be with other bands of Crow lodging in the Beartooth Mountains. All the young men were challenged {{to go into the}} hills to seek visions, and Plenty Coups did so. Plenty Coups walked for two days (fasting as he went) and entered the Crazy Mountains, but had no vision. He returned a few days later with three friends, fasted, and took sweat-baths. He decided to cut off the tip of his left index finger as an offering to the spirits. That night, he dreamt of the chief of the Little People again. The chief introduced Plenty Coups to a buffalo that turned into a man with buffalo-like features (the buffalo-man), who led him underground and down a tunnel or path toward the Pryor Mountains. For two days, he traveled underground among throngs of American bison. Finally, the buffalo-man showed Plenty Coups a vision of endless streams of bison coming out of {{a hole in the ground}} but disappearing. Then a second stream of bison—with different colors (even spots), tails, and sounds—came up out of the ground, and remained on the plains. Plenty Coups had a vision of himself as an old man lodged near the Medicine Rocks, and of a vast forest whose trees had been felled by a great wind. Only a chickadee remained. A voice told Plenty Coups that the day of the Plains Indian was ending, and that white men would swarm over the land like buffalo. But the chickadee remains, because it is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>listener,</b> develops its mind, and survives by its wits.|$|E
500|$|According to Walker, {{the power}} of words is another theme that appears {{repeatedly}} in Caged Bird. For example, Maya chooses to not speak after her rape because she is afraid of the destructive power of words. Mrs. Flowers, by introducing her to classic literature and poetry, teaches her about the positive power of language and empowers Maya to speak again. [...] The importance of both the spoken and written word also appears repeatedly in Caged Bird and in all of Angelou's autobiographies. Referring {{to the importance of}} literacy and methods of effective writing, Angelou once advised Oprah Winfrey in an 1993 interview to [...] "do as West Africans do... listen to the deep talk", or the [...] "utterances existing beneath the obvious". McPherson says, [...] "If there is one stable element in Angelou's youth it is [...] dependence upon books". The public library is a [...] "quiet refuge" [...] to which Maya retreats when she experiences crisis. Hagen describes Angelou as a [...] "natural story-teller", which [...] "reflect <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>listener</b> with a rich oral heritage". Hagen also insists that Angelou's years of muteness provided her with this skill.|$|E

These interpolations were managed with much tact; sometimes they were in the form of questions, which reminded me of something I had intended to say, but had omitted, which led me to speak further upon the subject, perhaps on some other phase of it.

This is intrinsic to his worldview. He cares very strongly for those close to him, and holds a surprisingly pacifistic outlook considering his profession. JJ acts very childlike at times, and this causes his colleagues to dismiss him automatically. However he proves to be <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>listener,</b> {{despite the fact that}} he doesn't usually appear to be taking things in.

40|$|Listening {{is the one}} of four {{important}} {{skills to}} study {{and it is a}} basic skill that is needed to communicate.

50|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the show, Charlie always has had a friend on the show and, now that she is a key character, is a friend also to a group of characters. Charlie's best friend was the devious Clarissa for the first years. Even though Clarissa betrayed Charlie a couple of times, the two remained as friends until Clarissa's exit in 2001. The friendship between the two woman was very unequal. While Clarissa was scheming, Charlie became <b>a</b> <b>good</b> person. And even in {{the beginning}}, Charlie was portrayed as little bit dumb and quirky, while Clarissa seemed intelligent and elegant. Over the years Charlie changed and has proven that she has become an intelligent businesswoman. After Clarissa's exit, Charlie's stupidity was gone too. Cécile de Maron, played by Yvonne Burbach, becomes Charlie's new best friend. Charlie develops as good soul and loyal friend to Cécile and also to Clarissa's stepson Henning, last played by Patrick Fichte. She is shown as someone who likes to play amour and <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>listener.</b> Charlie also becomes friends with other characters, most notable Arno Brandner, played by Konrad Krauss and Elisabeth von Lahnstein, played by Martina Servatius. In 2008, Charlie becomes friends with Nathalie von Lahnstein, played by Jenny Winkler, a woman that had committed a hit and run by Charlie. Also involved in this was her friend Elisabeth, who kept Nathalie's crime as a secret. Charlie forgives both of them, which once again shows the mentioned weakness in her personality.|$|R
