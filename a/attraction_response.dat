40|$|Fish live {{in waters}} of {{contaminant}} flux. In three urban, fish-bearing waterways of British Columbia, Canada, {{we found the}} active ingredients of WeedEx®, KillEx®, and Roundup® herbicide formulations (2, 4 -D, dicamba, glyphosate, and mecoprop) at low to high ng/L concentrations (0. 26 to 309 [*]ng/L) in routine conditions, i. e., no rain {{for at least one}} week. Following rain, these concentrations increased by an average of eightfold, suggesting runoff as a major route of herbicide introduction in these waterways. To determine whether fish might be able to limit point-source exposures through sensory-driven behaviors, we introduced pulses of representative herbicide mixtures to individual adult zebrafish (a model species) in flow-through tanks. Fish did the opposite of limit exposure; they chose to spend more time in pulses of herbicide mixtures representative of those that may occur with rain events. This <b>attraction</b> <b>response</b> was not altered by a previous 4 -d exposure to lower concentrations of the mixtures, suggesting fish will not learn from previous exposures. However, previous exposures did alter an <b>attraction</b> <b>response</b> to an amino acid prevalent in food (L-alanine). The present study demonstrates that fish living within urban waterways may elect to place themselves in herbicide-contaminated environments and that these exposures may alter their behavioral responses to cues necessary for survival.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that clothing is an important determinant of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s initial impression of a stranger. Color is a readily perceived feature of clothing, and thus may be one dimension of attire that contributes to the impression conveyed by the wearer. Using the premises of attraction theory and the findings of investigations concerning color meaning and affect, it was hypothesized that clothing color would influence <b>attraction</b> <b>responses</b> toward a stranger and attributions of the stranger 2 ̆ 7 s personality traits. ^ Three levels of clothing color pleasantness were factorially arranged with three levels of personal trait similarity to provide the experimental conditions under which to test the hypotheses. The experimental manipulations were accomplished by varying both the stimulus person 2 ̆ 7 s clothing color and the information given to subjects concerning the stimulus person 2 ̆ 7 s personal traits. The clothing color corresponded to the subject 2 ̆ 7 s choice of a pleasant, neutral, or unpleasant color as determined by pretests, and the trait information was contrived to be either similar or dissimilar to the subject 2 ̆ 7 s own traits, also determined by pretests. The third level of personal trait similarity constituted a Control condition in which no trait information was given. Subjects responded to a picture of a female stimulus person, expressing their impressions on measures of attraction, general affect, and personality trait ratings. ^ Analyses of variance showed that neither the clothing color nor the trait similarity manipulation influenced <b>attraction</b> or affective <b>responses.</b> In addition, trait attributions were not {{made on the basis of}} clothing color. Further analysis using multiple regression techniques indicated that two independent measures of perceived trait similarity were significant predictors of <b>attraction</b> <b>responses</b> but not of general affect.

We test our approach by deriving the apparent alignment and <b>attraction</b> <b>responses</b> from simulated trajectories of animals moving side by side, or one in front of the other. We show that the anisotropic positioning of individuals, in combination with noise, is sufficient to reproduce several aspects of the movement responses observed in real animal groups. This anisotropy at the level of interactions should be considered explicitly in future models of flocking and schooling. By making a distinction between interaction responses involved in maintaining a preferred flock configuration, and interaction responses directed at changing it, our work provides a frame to discriminate movement interactions that signal directional conflict from interactions underlying consensual group motion...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} two potential conservation {{problems for}} a residential sub-population of 75 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in Cockburn Sound, a small embayment within the southern metropolitan waters of Perth, Western Australia: (1) human-induced habitat change and (2) illegal feeding (i. e. unregulated provisioning) of dolphins. The work {{is important because}} Cockburn Sound is the most intensively utilised marine environment in Western Australia and industrial, commercial, and recreational uses of the area will intensify in coming decades. These considerations, coupled with the demographic and ecological vulnerability of residential populations of small cetaceans, suggested a risk of population decline without a more informed scientific basis for management. This study (2000 - 2003) complemented an earlier study of the Cockburn Sound dolphins (1993 - 1997) to provide a decade-long longitudinal study of the population. The original contributions of this study relate to: (a) the foraging ecology of dolphins;(b) the effects and mechanisms of human-dolphin interaction, particularly interactions based on unregulated provisioning; and (c) an integration of previous research and other information. Studies of the foraging ecology of dolphins within Cockburn Sound were undertaken between 2000 - 2 to determine the areas used by dolphins and their feeding behaviours so that the implications of human-induced habitat change could be assessed. These studies used belt transect sampling and event-specific sampling of foraging aggregations of dolphins to quantify the foraging habitat use of dolphins within the Sound and to characterise spatial and temporal patterns in aggregations of foraging dolphins. The {{results showed that the}} density of foraging dolphins varied significantly across habitats and that foraging aggregations consistently occur in an area known as the Kwinana Shelf during the austral autumn-spring period. The studies also suggested that the foraging ecology of dolphins in Cockburn Sound reflects the consistent utilisation of both: (a) low-density prey species (i. e. individual or weakly-schooling prey) and (b) high-density prey species (i. e. schooling species such as forage fish). These findings indicate that ecosystem-based conservations of the population should consider the conservation requirements of dolphin prey species and the ecological integrity of key foraging habitats like the Kwinana Shelf. Human-dolphin interactions based on the illegal feeding of dolphins in Cockburn Sound escalated between 1993 and 2003. By 2003, a total of 14 individuals exhibited behaviours indicative of conditioning to human interaction by food reinforcement, including some individuals that engaged in provisioning interactions on a chronic (i. e. long-term) basis. Observations of the effects of unregulated provisioning indicated that: (a) provisioned dolphins sustained increased higher rates of human-induced injury than non-provisioned dolphins and (b) provisioning was associated with substantial and enduring behavioural changes including changes in ranging and association patterns. Other observations of human-induced injury in Cockburn Sound included seven instances of calf entanglement. These findings indicate that the effects of illegal feeding and other forms of direct human-dolphin interaction (e. g. entanglement) could achieve biological significance for the population. The possible contribution of (a) human influences, (b) social learning, and (c) behavioural propensities (e. g. age and sex) on the acquisition of an <b>attraction</b> <b>response</b> to human provisioning was examined through logistic regression analysis using age, sex, use of high-boat density areas, and the number of close associates that were previously provisioned as predictor variables and the acquisition of an <b>attraction</b> <b>response</b> as the dependent variable. This analysis was supplemented by behavioural observations of interactions between provisioned and naive individuals during provisioning interactions. The results supported three findings: (1) a relatively high level of exposure to human provisioners was a significant predictor for the acquisition of an <b>attraction</b> <b>response</b> by dolphins; (2) social learning contributed to the acquisition of an <b>attraction</b> <b>response</b> in those individuals that more frequently utilised high-boat density areas; and (3) the potential contribution of behavioural propensities relating to age and sex was uncertain. These conclusions suggest that the acquisition of an <b>attraction</b> <b>response</b> to human provisioning can best be understood as the outcome of a complex of interacting factors. The findings also indicate: (a) the management value of individual-specific and longitudinal data for the management of harmful human-wildlife interactions and (b) the potential for social learning to contribute to the development and persistence of these interactions. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} population decline in Cockburn Sound could be induced by: (1) a reduction in the Sound?s environmental carrying capacity or (2) mortality, injury, and behavioural changes resulting from interactions with humans. The potential for such a decline and evidence demonstrating the harmful effects of human activities on dolphins supports the application of preventative approach to the management of illegal feeding and entanglement and a precautionary approach to environmental impact assessments of proposed developments. Mitigation of direct human-dolphins like illegal feeding requires an enforcement and education program to encourage more responsible human attitudes towards interactions with dolphins. Research on the ecology and composition of finfish assemblages and the trophic structure of the Kwinana shelf would assist efforts to mitigate the impact of human-induced habitat change...|$|E

These bioassays showed that the E,Z isomer of MD is the most active when tested with chalcogran.

We observed high variations in factors like slopes, thresholds, and peaks of responses that, in agreement with previous studies, suggest that the responses of different receptors are quite different for the similar change in concentration of various ligands. We also observed that lower attraction thresholds predicted higher peak amplitude. This suggests that if odor responses encompassed wider concentration range than can be covered by the dynamic range of a single receptor, then responses tend to be high in magnitude. © The Author 2013.

40|$|Background: Biting {{habit of}} {{mosquitoes}} {{plays an important}} role in the epidemiology of mosquito-borne diseases. Mosquitoes use a set of elaborate sensory modalities to find their preferred hosts by exploiting cues emanating from a nearby host. It has been suggested that the chemical profile of skin can provide further support for anthropophilic mosquito species to find their suitable hosts. This study aimed at revealing the value of skin emanation for a zoophilic species like Anopheles stephensi as a model. Methods: Skin emanations of a man, a cow and a Guinea pig were collected by ethanol soaked cottons. Upwind responses of mosquitoes to 100 and 200 2 l of filtered skin materials were non-competitively explored in a dual-choice olfactometer. L-lactic acid and other chemical content of the skin samples were identified by an enzymatic kit and GC-MS, respectively. Results: Unexpectedly, only human skin emanation was resulted in the statistically significant activation and <b>attraction</b> <b>responses</b> of An. stephensi in the wind tunnel. L-lactic acid content of this skin sample was 10 and 29 times more than the cow and the Guinea pig, respectively. The possible role of lactic acid and a few other identified compounds have been discussed here. Conclusion: An. stephensi showed higher and more specific upwind responses to human skin emanation in the olfactometer. Undoubtedly, the thorough explanation of this unexpected finding needs further investigation. But, if new data verify this result, then, it may be necessary to reconsider the role of skin emanation and thence the human blood index and vectorial capacity of this zoophilic mosquito. </p...|$|R
40|$|For many organisms {{the ability}} to transduce light into {{cellular}} signals is crucial for survival. Light stimulates DNA repair and metabolism changes in bacteria, avoidance responses in single-cell organisms, <b>attraction</b> <b>responses</b> in plants, and both visual and nonvisual perception in animals. Despite these widely differing responses, in all of nature there are only six known families of proteins that can transduce light. Although the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans has none of the known light transduction systems, we show here that C. elegans strongly accelerates its locomotion in response to blue or shorter wavelengths of light, with maximal responsiveness to ultraviolet light. Our data suggest that C. elegans uses this light response to escape the lethal doses of sunlight that permeate its habitat. Short-wavelength light drives locomotion by bypassing two critical signals, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and diacylglycerol (DAG), that neurons use to shape and control behaviors. C. elegans mutants lacking these signals are paralyzed and unresponsive to harsh physical stimuli in ambient light, but short-wavelength light rapidly rescues their paralysis and restores normal levels of coordinated locomotion. This light response is mediated by LITE- 1, a novel ultraviolet light receptor that acts in neurons {{and is a member}} of the invertebrate Gustatory receptor (Gr) family. Heterologous expression of the receptor in muscle cells is sufficient to confer light responsiveness on cells that are normally unresponsive to light.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Response {{behavior}} of a nonlinear structural system subject to environmental loadings is investigated in this study. The system contains a nonlinear restoring force due to large geometric displacement. The external excitation is modeled as a narrowband stochastic process possessing dynamic characteristics of typical environmental loadings. A semi-analytical method is developed to predict the stochastic nonlinear response behavior under narrowband excitations in both the primary and the subharmonic resonance regions. Preservation of deterministic response characteristics under the narrowband random field is assumed. The stochastic system response induced by variations in the narrowband excitations is considered as a sequence of successive transient states. Due to the system nonlinearity, under a combination of excitation conditions, several <b>response</b> <b>attraction</b> domains may co-exist. Presence of co-existence of attraction domains and variations in the excitation amplitude often induce complex response inter-domain transitions. The response characteristics {{are found to be}} attraction domain dependent. Among different <b>response</b> <b>attraction</b> domains, their corresponding response amplitude domains overlap. In addition, within an individual <b>attraction</b> domain, <b>response</b> amplitude domains corresponding to different excitation amplitudes also overlap. Overlapping of response amplitude domains and the time-dependent variations in the excitation parameters induce response intra-domain transitions. Stationary Markovian assumption is employed to characterize the stochastic {{behavior of}} the response amplitude process and the excitation parameter processes. Based on the stochastic excitation properties and the deterministic response characteristics, governing equations of the response amplitude probability inter- and intra-domain transitions are formulated. Numerical techniques and an iteration procedure are employed to evaluate the stationary response amplitude probability distribution. The proposed semi-analytical method is validated by extensive numerical simulations. The capability of the method is demonstrated by good agreements among the predicted response amplitude distributions and the simulation results in both the primary and the subharmonic resonance regions. Variations in the stochastic response behavior under varying excitation bandwidth and variance are also predicted accurately. Repeated occurrences of various subharmonic responses observed in the numerical simulations are taken into account in the proposed analysis. Comparisons of prediction results with those obtained by existing analytical methods and simulation histograms show that a significant improvement in the prediction accuracy is achieved...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the first}} study to {{investigate}} the source of visitor first awareness of a low profile <b>attraction.</b> Questionnaire <b>responses</b> from 976 walk-in visitors to South Carolina's Francis Beidler Forest reveal word of mouth (WOM) {{as the most important}} source, followed by regionally placed brochures and local highway signage. Sample segmentation indicated that local residents are more likely to experience habitual exposure based on routine travel and newspaper subscriptions, while visitors from other parts of South Carolina exhibit social exposure as indicated by a much higher rate of WOM citation. Out of state and international visitors are more likely to experience opportunistic exposure through encounters with tourism publications and with brochures encountered at state welcome centers and in accommodations or attractions in the greater Charleston area.

40|$|A triple cage {{olfactometer}} {{provided with}} insect traps {{was used for}} evaluating behavioral responses of Stomoxys calcitrans (L.) females to human skin and breath, CO 2, and L-lactic acid analogs. After demonstrating {{there were no significant}} differences caused by cage location or time of day, 3 sets of 3 olfactometer tests were performed in a day, every 2 h beginning at 0900 hours. When a human hand was used as attractant, the attraction (expressed as percentage of trapped flies) increased as a function of the time; an inverted U-shaped relationship between attractancy and air speed was observed; and variation in fly density in the range 25 - 75 per cage did not affect the <b>attraction</b> <b>response.</b> When human breath was used as attractant the attraction increased linearly as a function of time and it was exhalation frequency dependent; when air flow was absent the highest response was observed; and 24 - to 38 -h-old flies were more attracted than younger and older. When CO 2 was tested, activation and orientation and probing behavior were concentration dependent with flows ranging between 0. 0001 and 0. 038 liter s- 1, but attraction was not. No attraction was observed with 10, 100, or 1, 000 µg of compounds related to L-lactic acid and several synthetic human odors and related compounds, although orientation was often observed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{response}} {{behavior of}} three dissimilatory perchlorate-reducing bacteria to different electron acceptors (nitrate, chlorate, and perchlorate) was investigated with two different assays. The observed response was species-specific, {{dependent on the}} prior growth conditions, and was inhibited by oxygen. We observed attraction toward nitrate when Dechloromonas aromatica strain RCB and Azospira suillum strain PS were grown with nitrate. When D. aromatica and Dechloromonas agitata strain CKB were grown with perchlorate, both responded to nitrate, chlorate, and perchlorate. When A. suillum was grown with perchlorate, the organism responded to chlorate and perchlorate but not nitrate. A gene replacement mutant in the perchlorate reductase subunit (pcrA) of D. aromatica resulted {{in a loss of}} the <b>attraction</b> <b>response</b> toward perchlorate but had no impact on the nitrate response. Washed-cell suspension studies revealed that the perchlo-rate grown cells of D. aromatica reduced both perchlorate and nitrate, while A. suillum cells reduced perchlorate only. Based on these observations, energy taxis was proposed as the underlying mechanism for the responses to (per) chlorate by D. aromatica. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first investigation of the response behavior of perchlorate-reducing bacteria to environmental stimuli. It clearly demonstrates attraction toward chlorine oxyanions and the unique ability of these organisms to distinguish structurally analogous compounds, nitrate, chlorate, and perchlorate and respond accordingly...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{new possibilities}} to control whiteflies in greenhouse ornamental crops with omnivorous predatory bugs and volatiles. Besides the well-known Macrolophus pygmaeus, we tested 4 {{new species of}} predatory bugs: Dicyphus errans, Dicyphus eckerleini, Dicyphus maroccanus and Dicyphus tamaninii. We assessed both their potential to control whiteflies and their possible plant damaging effects through plant feeding. The best control of whiteflies was achieved by the species M. pygmaeus, D. tamaninii and D. maroccanus. Significant flower damage was only observed for the predator M. pygmaeus. The degree of flower damage depended strongly on the gerbera cultivar, but damage was observed for both large-flowered and small-flowered types. All 5 species of predatory bugs were able to establish in a winter crop of 2 gerbera cultivars and the exotic plant Lantana camara. The most promising candidate predatory bug for biological control in gerbera is D. maroccanus. This species established well on the 2 tested gerbera cultivars, gave in all cases an excellent control of pests and no significant plant damage was observed. The predatory bugs gave, besides whiteflies, a good control of Echinothrips {{and in some cases}} a suppression of aphids and western flower thrips. The volatile limonene showed no significant effect on the oviposition of tobacco and greenhouse whiteflies. Neither did they repel adults of these whiteflies. The mixture of (E) - 2 -hexenal and 3 -hexen- 1 -ol did not induce a significant <b>attraction</b> <b>response</b> of the adult whiteflies...|$|E
40|$|Understanding what psycho-physiological and {{behavioural}} factors influence aversiveness {{of sound}} in marine mammals {{is important for}} conservation and practical applications. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine predictors for impact of anthropogenic noise and to develop a target-specific predator deterrence system for use on fish farms. Three classes of stimuli were tested: 1.) grey seal underwater communication calls expected to be used in territorial defence, 2.) high duty-cycle moderately loud artificial sounds (some of which were based on models of unpleasantness for humans), 3.) brief, intense pulses designed to elicit the acoustic startle reflex. Communication calls had no deterrence effect but instead caused <b>attraction</b> <b>responses.</b> Tests with high duty-cycle artificial sounds showed that food-motivated animals habituate quickly, although sound exposure caused subtle changes in diving patterns over a longer time. Field trials using the same stimuli were used to determine avoidance thresholds but also indicated that sound features like ‘roughness’ play a role. The startle eliciting stimuli, however, had the most dramatic effects. To this stimulus most seals exhibited rapid flight responses, hauled out, sensitised and showed signs of fear conditioning. Startle thresholds were found to be 80 - 85 dB above the assumed hearing threshold. The data showed that startle thresholds are a crucial predictor for the occurrence of strong avoidance behaviour and suggests that the startle response evolved to increase an animal’s propensity for flight. Finally, a prototype predator deterrence system based on the startle sounds was developed to repel seals whilst not affecting toothed whales. In fish farm trials, seals were deterred at close ranges but local abundance of cetaceans did not change showing that it is possible to cause differential responses between species based on differences in their audiograms. The results are used to develop noise exposure criteria and to elucidate acoustic parameters that can be used to predict responses to anthropogenic noise.

40|$|High-risk human papillomaviruses (hrHPVs) infect keratinocytes and {{successfully}} evade host immunity {{despite the fact}} that keratinocytes are well equipped to respond to innate and adaptive immune signals. Using non-infected and freshly established or persistent hrHPV-infected keratinocytes we show that hrHPV impairs the acetylation of NFκB/RelA K 310 in keratinocytes. As a consequence, keratinocytes display a decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production and immune cell <b>attraction</b> in <b>response</b> to stimuli of the innate or adaptive immune pathways. HPV accomplishes this by augmenting the expression of interferon-related developmental regulator 1 (IFRD 1) in an EGFR-dependent manner. Restoration of NFκB/RelA acetylation by IFRD 1 shRNA, cetuximab treatment or the HDAC 1 / 3 inhibitor entinostat increases basal and induced cytokine expression. Similar observations are made in IFRD 1 -overexpressing HPV-induced cancer cells. Thus, our study reveals an EGFR-IFRD 1 -mediated viral immune evasion mechanism, which can also be exploited by cancer cells...|$|R
