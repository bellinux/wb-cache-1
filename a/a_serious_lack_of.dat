5|$|Through the {{decryption}} of German radio communications, the Allied headquarters {{became aware}} of the German withdrawal plan. They recognized the open German flank to the east of the Rhône at Grenoble due the retreat of the 157th Infantry Division towards the Alps. To seize this opportunity, Taskforce Butler was ordered to advance in this direction, paralleling the German evacuation effort and ultimately cutting them off further north. While doing so, it fought some scattered German resistance, and finally, after turning left, found itself near Montélimar, a small city on the east bank of the Rhône River. This town lay directly on the German escape route. Following Taskforce Butler was the 36th Infantry Division. Together, they were tasked on 20August to block the German force at Montélimar as well as continue the northward advance to Grenoble, while VICorps was pursuing the Germans from behind. However, after this speedy advance, the forward Allied forces suffered now from <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> fuel and supplies, which made this task difficult.|$|E

40|$|A DAEE {{working paper}} on urban {{agricultural}} activities in Zimbabwe. Crop production on open municipal and undeveloped lands {{has become a}} significant source of the food security and indirectly sources of household cash income generation or savings. Advent of economic reforms has exacerbated urban agriculture. This is because of the removal of subsidies on food commodities and retrenchments in the formal employment sectors. These have in turn contributed to falling real incomes and reduced food security status of urban households. Urban cultivation had become an important strategy through which families cope with the impact of the economic structure adjustment programme. Though a widespread practice, urban agriculture is not planned for or supported by other planners and managers as a legitimate form of urban land use. Urban agriculture comes into direct conflict with planning provisions for urban space. This study examines the socio-economics of urban crop on municipal lands, cultivators’ views and perceptions on the use of urban space for agricultural activities and related issues in Harare, Zimbabwe. Urban agriculture is used for subsistence maize production. It improves food grain availability, thus increasing household food security and real incomes available for other household requirements as contributes to savings on food expenditure. This is the incentive for cultivation on undeveloped urban land spaces. The study gives empirical insight on the uses of urban space for agricultural activities from the cultivators' perspectives.

Qualitative research method was used for this study. In total, forty-four interviews were conducted in selected public and private hospitals equally, of which thirty-seven were semi-structured interviews and remaining seven were informal interviews.

Using in-depth interviews, it found that social grants did help reduce poverty, both in terms of helping meet basic needs and enabling grant recipients to make more choices, including facilitating job searches and small businesses.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Women {{awaiting}} abdominal hysterectomy have {{a further}} {{decision to take}} [...] {{whether or not to}} undergo a prophylactic oophorectomy. Prophylactic oophorectomy (removal of healthy ovaries) is commonly undertaken as an adjunct to hysterectomy to prevent ovarian cancer in women who are already having a hysterectomy for menorrhagia, fibroids or severe menstrual pain. It causes an immediate 'surgical menopause' [...] women no longer produce endogenous oestrogens and they are advised to take hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This descriptive study was undertaken {{as part of a larger}} pilot study. DESIGN: Qualitative interviewing study. SETTING: Hospital outpatient departments in southern England. SAMPLE: Women on waiting lists for hysterectomy for benign conditions. METHODS: In-depth semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 16 women awaiting hysterectomy to examine their views of prophylactic oophorectomy, menopause and HRT use. Interviews were transcribed. Nud*ist was used to organise the data. Analysis was undertaken by two researchers working independently who then met to agree themes. RESULTS: Women held treatment preferences both about the removal or retention of their ovaries and about subsequent HRT use. Many of the women did not want oophorectomy because of a dislike of a sudden menopause. Those who were planning to have an oophorectomy tended to have more severe symptoms. Some women were fearful of ovarian cancer [...] one woman described it as a 'silent killer'. A further theme was apparent in the discussion of ovaries as 'redundant' with further discussion of healthy versus problematic ovaries. Many women felt inadequately informed about their treatment options and were unaware of important longer term outcomes of oophorectomy such as an increased risk of osteoporosis or of coronary heart disease. CONCLUSION: It appears that many women emphasise the 'natural' when considering oophorectomy and the use of HRT. Women were uneasy both about a sudden menopause and about the risks of ovarian cancer. And although these women were all about to undergo surgery, they had experienced <b>an</b> apparent <b>serious</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> information especially about long term risks and benefits on which they might base their decision...|$|R

In order to achieve the aim of the study, the objective of the study were to investigate the economic and social reasons why adult learners do not attend classes. The research focus on a critical issue of absenteei(sm by adult learners at SEKGOSESE West Circuit adult centre in Limpopo Province. Literature review was engaged in the field of Adult Education and related to the research problem. The literature review presented an insight into theoretical frameworks and conceptual frameworks about causes of adult learner’s absenteeism. The researcher used sources which included journals, books, articles and dissertations. To collect information. This qualitative study explored the causes of adult learner absenteeism and came with strategies to reduce adult learner absenteeism. Critical theory was used as a theoretical framework. The theory deals with social economic factors and conditions under which people live. Data was collected through focus group interviews. There were sixteen participants who attend classes at Mosima adult learning centre, and they were selected homogeneously. It was discovered that adult learner absenteeism is caused by <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> motivation, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> support from departmental officials, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> adult learner commitment, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> facilities, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> qualified adult educators, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> respect amongst adult learners and adult educators as <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> matter, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> parental support for those who are still under parental care and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> transport for adult learners who stay far from the centre.
