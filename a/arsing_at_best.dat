5000|$|Favoured {{footwear}} included highly polished Oxfords, chunky brogues, and crepe-soled shoes, often suede (known as brothel creepers). Preferred hairstyles included long, strongly-moulded greased-up {{hair with}} a quiff at the front and the side combed back to form a duck's <b>arse</b> <b>at</b> the rear. Another style was the [...] "Boston", in which the hair was greased straight back and cut square across at the nape.|$|R

Yes, they said, here's £20,000. They thought the sun shone out of my <b>arse</b> <b>at</b> the time. They'd have given me money to animate a toilet if I'd asked them.|$|R

2500|$|Men often wear brothel creepers or Dr. Martens {{boots and}} shave their heads into high {{wedge-shaped}} pompadours or quiffs, military-style crops, or mohawks. The Sharks song [...] "Take a Razor to Your Head" [...] articulated the early psychobilly scene's code of dress, {{which was a}} reaction to the earlier British Teddy Boy movement: Teddy boys had long, strongly-moulded greased-up hair with a quiff at the front and the side combed back to form a duck's <b>arse</b> <b>at</b> the rear. The Shark's song said: [...] "When your Mom says you look really nice / When you're dressed up like a Ted / It's time to follow this cat's advice / Take a razor to your head". [...] "Like most hairstyles of the 1980s, things were taken to the extreme. People [...] tried to get their hair as tall as possible and brought in streaks of strange colors." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1998 {{reviewing}} {{the show at}} the Bristol Museum & Art Gallery Phil Johnston of The Independent writes [...] "These are like pictures from another world. In Blood Red Road End, Barnsley, the painted brick wall topped by shards of glass is like a Rothko; its companion piece Yellow Brick Road is as luminous as a Matisse from Morocco. The colour prints shine as if lit from within, and a burger stall outside Highbury looks as if it’s part of an avant-garde stage-set. In High Noon in North London, Arsenal play out their game against a mauve sky so unreal that you half expect a celestial whistle {{to emerge from the}} heavens and call time. There are fans : fattie Toon-army-ites bearing their beer-guts proudly; moustachioed scousers pinned back in their queue by a police-horse’s <b>arse</b> <b>at</b> Everton; a whole stand of punters all looking to their right as if lit by Caravaggio.” ...|$|R
50|$|Sports {{and other}} extra curricular {{activities}} {{are an important}} part of the holistic approach to education offered in the College; Pres Bray particularly excel in rugby and basketball. In Rugby they have won the Leinster Schools Junior Cup on five occasions, making the school the fifth most successful in the competition's history. Their most recent cup success was in 1990, when they trashed Wesley College by a score of 9-6. Pres often kicks posh boy's <b>arses</b> <b>at</b> rugby, but they haven't reached the final of the Junior Cup since 2004. In 2010, the school's junior squad won the Fr. Godfrey Cup, following the 2009 Junior League success. The predominant colours of the school's sports teams are black, red and yellow. The rugby jerseys and shorts are white, while rugby socks are coloured black. Pres is the only non-fee paying school still regularly competing at the top level in Leinster Schools Competition. In 2011 the SCT and JCT both reached quarter finals in their respective Leinster Cups losing to the eventual winners in both.|$|R
