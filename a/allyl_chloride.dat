Preparation of the robust air- and moisture-stable PCS-pincer palladium complex 5 [X] started from the symmetrical,-dibromo-meta-xylene and involved the selective substitution of one bromide by PPh 2 (BH 3), followed by substitution of the second bromide by SPh and subsequent introduction of the palladium. The new PCS complexes (5 [X]) were employed as catalysts in two important organic transformations. Firstly, complex 5 [Cl] displays high catalytic activity in aldol reactions but enters the catalytic cycle as a precatalyst. Secondly, complex 5 [BF 4] displays tandem catalytic activity in the coupling of <b>allyl</b> <b>chlorides</b> with aldehydes and imines {{in the presence of}} hexamethylditin. In these tandem catalytic reactions the first process is the conversion of <b>allyl</b> <b>chlorides</b> into trimethylallyltin (and trimethyltin chloride) with Sn 2 Me 6, which is followed by catalytic allylation of aldehyde and sulfonimine substrates. In addition, we present a new catalytic process for the one-pot allylation of 4 -nitrobenzaldehyde with vinyloxirane. The catalytic performance of the novel PCS-pincer palladium complex was compared to those of its symmetrical PCP- and SCS-pincer complex analogues. It was concluded that the unsymmetrical PCS complex advantageously unifies the attractive catalytic features of the corresponding symmetrical pincer complexes including both (π-) electron-withdrawing (such as phosphorus) or (σ-) electron-donating (such as sulfur and nitrogen) heteroatoms.

40|$|Allyl phenyl sulfides {{have proven}} to be {{extremely}} versatile and widely used reagents in organic chemistry. There are thousands of publications that relate their uses in synthesis. However, the conventional method of preparing ã-substituted allyl phenyl sulfides by alkylation of deprotonated commercially available allyl phenyl sulfides, only allows electrophilic groups to be introduced. This method fails if the alkylating agent is tertiary, secondary, vinylic, or arylic. In this work a new method, in which a nucleophilic group can be introduced at the carbon atom bearing the phenylthio group, referred to as ã-allylic substitution, is thoroughly studied and used in several examples to demonstrate its significance for synthesis. This procedure should vastly increase access {{to a wide variety of}} allyl phenyl sulfides. In this work, copper mediated ã-allylic substitution reactions of organozinc reagents with <b>allyl</b> <b>chlorides</b> bearing a ã-phenylthio group are reported and the best reaction conditions for mono- and dialkylzincs are revealed. The scope and limitations of ã-allylic substitutions of organozincs with a variety of different <b>allyl</b> <b>chlorides</b> were thoroughly investigated and an important temperature effect was observed and used to expand the scope of these reactions. Furthermore, this work deals with an important aspect of the preparation of the organometallic nucleophiles required for these ã-substitutions. Many of these can be prepared by reductive lithiation of readily available alkyl phenyl thioethers by aromatic radical-anions. However, large-scale preparations suffer from the requirement of separation of the desired product from the aromatic byproduct using either slow column chromatography or vacuum sublimation. An improved procedure for reductive lithiation of phenyl thioethers with 1 -(N,N-dimethylamino) naphthalenide was developed to overcome this drawback. Reductive lithiation was then used not only as a preliminary step in the preparation of organozincs for copper mediated ã-regioselective substitution reactions but also as a key step in the enantioselective synthesis of (R) -(+) -dihydro-á-ionone.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on two {{important}} fields of palladium catalysis: the development of electrophilic allylic substitution reactions via bis-allylpalladium intermediates; and application of palladium pincer-complexes in the synthesis and transformations of organometallic compounds. Palladium-catalyzed electrophilic allylation of aldehyde and imine substrates could be achieved using readily available <b>allyl</b> <b>chlorides</b> and acetates by employing hexamethylditin or bis(pinacolato) diboron reagents. The reaction proceeds under mild and neutral reaction conditions with high regioselectivity, providing the branched homoallylic products. The stereoselectivity of the reaction depends on the steric and electronic effects of the allylic substituents of the substrates. DFT modeling of the electrophilic attack on the bis-allylpalladium intermediate of the reaction revealed {{the origin of the}} regio- and stereoselectivity of the reaction. Palladium pincer-complexes were employed as catalysts in a variety of reactions such as stannylation, selenylation, allylation, and cross coupling reactions with various electrophiles. Allylic stannylation in the presence of hexamethylditin was achieved by use of an NCN palladium pincer-complex catalyst. In contrast to the reactions catalyzed by traditional palladium catalysts, isolation of functionalized allyl stannanes was possible due to the special features of the pincer-complex catalyst. Extension of the scope of the palladium pincer-complex catalyzed electrophilic allylation reactions was achieved by using potassium trifluoro(allyl) borate instead of allyl stannanes.
