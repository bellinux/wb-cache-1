5|$|In February 2008, Lazcano Lazcano sent Treviño Morales to kill rival {{drug traffickers}} and {{take control of}} the drug {{trafficking}} routes in Guatemala. Reportedly, he carried out a military-like ambush that resulted in the death of the Guatemalan drug lord Juan José León Ardón (alias Juancho) in March. An unnamed U.S. official said that Treviño Morales may have been the man who fired the bullet that killed the drug kingpin. Having succeeded outside of Mexico, Treviño Morales was appointed by Lazcano Lazcano as the national commander of Los Zetas, a position traditionally reserved to Zetas members with military background. In this position, Treviño Morales had a say in nearly <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> Los Zetas made at a national level, creating some resentment among the old-generation commanders of Los Zetas who, unlike him, had been in the Mexican Armed Forces before turning to the drug trade.|$|E

25|$|Broadfield House is a 19th-century villa-style {{house in}} the Broadfield {{neighbourhood}} of Crawley, a town and borough in West Sussex, England. Built in 1830 on the extensive land of the Tilgate Estate south of the small market town of Crawley, it was extended later in the 19th century and converted into a country club. After World War II, Crawley was designated a New Town and had to prepare for rapid, strictly planned growth.

25|$|The silverback is {{the center}} of the troop's attention, making <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions,</b> {{mediating}} conflicts, determining the movements of the group, leading the others to feeding sites, and taking responsibility for the safety and well-being of the troop. Younger males subordinate to the silverback, known as blackbacks, may serve as backup protection. Blackbacks are aged between 8 and 12 years and lack the silver back hair. The bond that a silverback has with his females forms the core of gorilla social life. Bonds between them are maintained by grooming and staying close together. Females form strong relationships with males to gain mating opportunities and protection from predators and infanticidal outside males. However, aggressive behaviours between males and females do occur, but rarely lead to serious injury. Relationships between females may vary. Maternally related females in a troop tend to be friendly towards each other and associate closely. Otherwise, females have few friendly encounters and commonly act aggressively towards each other.|$|E
25|$|Peasants {{continued}} to center {{their lives in}} the village, where they were members of a corporate body, and to help manage the community resources and monitor the community life. In the East, they were serfs who were bound permanently to parcels of land. In most of Germany, farming was handled by tenant farmers who paid rents and obligatory services to the landlord, who was typically a nobleman. Peasant leaders supervised the fields and ditches and grazing rights, maintained public order and morals, and supported a village court which handled minor offenses. Inside the family the patriarch made <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions,</b> and tried to arrange advantageous marriages for his children. Much of the villages' communal life centered around church services and holy days. In Prussia, the peasants drew lots to choose conscripts required by the army. The noblemen handled external relationships and politics for the villages under their control, and were not typically involved in daily activities or decisions.|$|E

500|$|After the {{disaster}} at Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt {{turned to the}} most aggressive sailor available, Admiral Ernest J. King (1878-1956). Experienced in big guns, aviation and submarines, King had a broad knowledge and a total dedication to victory. He {{was perhaps the most}} dominating admiral in American naval history; he was hated but obeyed, for he made <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> from his command post in the Washington, and avoided telling anyone. [...] The civilian Secretary of the Navy was a cipher whom King kept in the dark; that only changed when the Secretary died in 1944 and Roosevelt brought in his tough-minded aide James Forrestal. [...] Despite the decision of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Admiral William D. Leahy to concentrate first against Germany, King made the defeat of Japan his highest priority. For example, King insisted on fighting for Guadalcanal despite strong Army objections. [...] His main strike force was built around carriers based at Pearl Harbor under the command of Chester Nimitz. [...] Nimitz had one main battle fleet, with the same ships and sailors but two command systems that rotated every few months between Admiral Bull Halsey and Admiral Raymond A. Spruance. The Navy had a major advantage: it had broken the Japanese code. [...] It deduced that Hawaii was the target in June 1942, and that Yamamoto’s fleet would strike at Midway Island. King only had four carriers in operation; he sent them all to Midway where in a miraculous few minutes they sank the Japanese carriers. This gave the Americans the advantage in firepower that grew rapidly as new American warships came on line much faster than Japan could build them. King paid special attention to submarines to use against the overextended Japanese logistics system. They were built for long-range missions in tropical waters, and set out to sink the freighters, troop transports and oil tankers that held the Japanese domains together. The Southwest Pacific theatre, based in Australia, was under the control of Army General Douglas MacArthur; King assigned him a fleet of his own without any big carriers.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe dynamic multi-attribute {{decision}} making problems with intuitionistic fuzzy information are investigated. The notions of intuitionistic fuzzy variable and uncertain intuitionistic fuzzy variable are defined, and two new aggregation operators: dynamic intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging (DIFWA) operator and uncertain dynamic intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging (UDIFWA) operator are presented. Some methods, including the basic unit-interval monotonic (BUM) function based method, normal distribution based method, exponential distribution based method and average age method, {{are introduced to}} determine the weight vectors associated with these operators. A procedure based on the DIFWA operator is developed to solve the dynamic intuitionistic fuzzy multi-attribute {{decision making}} (DIF-MADM) problems where <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> information about attribute values {{takes the form of}} intuitionistic fuzzy numbers collected at different periods, and a procedure based on the UDIFWA operator is developed for DIF-MADM under interval uncertainty in which <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> information about attribute values takes the form of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers collected at different periods. Finally, a practical case is used to illustrate the developed procedures...|$|R
