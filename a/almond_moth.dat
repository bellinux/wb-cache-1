50|$|The <b>almond</b> <b>moth</b> or {{tropical}} {{warehouse moth}} (Cadra cautella) is a small stored-product pest. It belongs to the snout moths (family Pyralidae), more specifically to the tribe Phycitini of the huge snout moth subfamily Phycitinae. This species is often confused with the related Indian mealmoth (Plodia interpunctella).|$|E
50|$|Anna Levinson has {{collaborated with}} {{national}} and international research teams like those of Wittko Francke, Christoph Reichmuth, Kenji Mori, Robert M. Silverstein and Konstantin Buchelos investigating the mode of action and employment of pheromone traps for stored product beetles and moths, particularly khapra beetles, hide beetles, tobacco beetles, grain moths, meal moths, flour moths, tobacco moths as well as <b>almond</b> <b>moths.</b> These traps were eventually patented in numerous countries and are routinely used until now. They significantly {{reduce the number of}} insecticidal treatments required in the storage environment. In total she wrote more than 100 scientific papers.|$|R
500|$|Like other Iridomyrmex species, {{the meat}} ant is an omnivore, {{retrieving}} food sources from various insects it tends, including caterpillars and various sorts of butterflies, particularly the larvae of the Waterhouse's hairstreak (Jalmenus lithochroa). Meat ants usually feed on honeydew from sap-sucking insects, flower nectar, sugar and other sweet substances. In captive colonies, workers prefer to consume {{small pieces of}} grapes rather than honey solutions and other sweet foods. These ants prey on various insects and animals, collecting both live and dead invertebrates and acquire meat from dead vertebrates. Insects the meat ants prey on include giant lacewings, which they swarm up trees to kill, the butterfly genoveva azure Ogyris genoveva, Indian mealmoths, <b>almond</b> <b>moths,</b> the Western Australian jarrah leafminer and the larvae of the wasp Trichogramma. Large and developed larvae of the [...] cabbage butterfly (Pieris rapae) are attacked more effectively by meat ant workers than those of other Iridomyrmex species. On sandy beaches, this species is observed preying on the polychaete annelid worm, Armandia intermedia, causing high mortality rates on them (rates of 30 percent). These ants will feed {{on a number of}} dead or alive animals, including metamorphic crucifix toads, snakes, lizards, and birds. On some occasions, swarms of workers have been found on dead foxes. The meat ant is the only known ant in Australia that feeds on fresh guano. The collection of guano by a nearby meat ant colony shows the opportunistic nature of the species. Observations show that trails of workers in groups of two to four were found collecting the guano under an active bat roost within an abandoned mine and proceeded to return it to the nest. The collection of guano by any Australian ant colony was never recorded prior to these observations, but it is unknown why meat ants collect fresh guano.|$|R
5000|$|The Indian mealmoth (Plodia interpunctella), {{alternatively}} spelled Indianmeal moth, is a pyraloid moth {{of the family}} Pyralidae. Alternative common names are weevil moth, and pantry moth; less specifically, it may {{be referred to as}} flour moth or grain moth. The <b>almond</b> <b>moth</b> (Cadra cautella) is commonly confused with the Indian mealmoth.|$|E
50|$|Cadra {{species can}} usually be {{recognized}} by their reduced forewing venation: veins 4, 7 and 9 are missing, making {{for a total of}} nine veins in the forewing. Some members of this genus are significant pests of dry plant produce, such as seeds and nuts. The <b>almond</b> <b>moth</b> (C. cautella) is a well-known example of these.|$|E
40|$|The larvicidal and pupicidal {{effects of}} {{methoprene}} were studied on the third-instar larvae of <b>almond</b> <b>moth,</b> Ephestia cautella Walker. The <b>almond</b> <b>moth,</b> E. cautella {{is a serious}} pest of stored cereals and cereal products. Methoprene is a safe alternative to conventional insecticide. In presented studies was demonstrated, that methoprene causes a significant enhancement in the larval mortal ity and {{a significant reduction in}} pupation and adult emergence. At 1 ppm of methoprene, larval mortal ity was 11. 80 ± 1. 70 % that increased to 1 00 % at 1 4 ppm. At 1 2 ppm of methoprene, 1 5. 00 ± 3. 03 % larvae pupate but al l get perished and hence none of them emerge.

40|$|Turkey {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} dried figs producing and exporting country, with a production amounting to some 50, 000 tones annually, comprising from 60 to 75 % of the international market. <b>Almond</b> <b>moth</b> {{is one of the}} main pests of dried fruits in Turkey. To control storage pests, which infest dried fruits in the processing and storage, methyl bromide (MB) had been used to disinfest for many years in Turkey. MB is already banned-out in post harvest sector in Turkey. The only chemical alternative to MB available in Turkey, is phosphine. The current study was conducted to determine the mortality of life stages of <b>almond</b> <b>moth,</b> Ephestia cautella (Walker) (Lepidoptera, Pyralidae), exposed to low level of phosphine at 20 oC and 65 % relative humidity. Egg (0 - 1, 1 - 2, and 2 - 3 d-old), larva (25 d-old), pupa (1 - 2 d-old), and adult (0 - 1 d-old) stages of E. cautella were exposed to a fixed gas concentration (100 ppm) of phosphine in a recirculation apparatus consisting of four flasks over a range of exposure periods, from 30 min to 72 h. The recirculation apparatus was setup to provid...|$|E
30|$|Previously, {{methyl bromide}} {{was used to}} control insect pests in stored dates as {{fumigant}} because it was effective in killing most insect stages; but this fumigant appeared to be ozone-depleting agents (Marcotte 1993). Therefore, it was prohibited since 2005 in developing countries and by 2015 in under developed countries according to Montreal Protocol (Al-Taweel et al. 2014). Therefore, alternative safe control methods are needed. One of these methods is using biological control agents specifically the egg parasitoid, Trichogramma evanescens West. (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) in date orchards to minimize the percentage of dates infestation with lepidopteran insect pests as the Greater date moth (Arenipses sabella Hampsm), <b>Almond</b> <b>moth</b> (Cadra cautella Walk), Indian meal moth Plodia interpunctella Hub., and pomegranate fruit butterfly (Virachola livia Klug).|$|E
40|$|The {{total body}} lipid and fatty acid {{composition}} of last instar larvae of the Indian-meal moth, Plodia interpunctella, and <b>almond</b> <b>moth,</b> Cadra cautella, reared on a turkey mash diet was determined. Male P. interpunctella larvae contained significantly higher (lA-fold) total body lipid than females, while {{no differences between}} the sexes of C. cautella larvae were observed. The relative abundance of the fatty acids palmitate, palmitoleate, stearate, oleate, lineoleate, and linolenate was similar in both sexes of P. interpunctella and C. cautella. The accumulation of individual fatty acids in larvae of both the moth species did not correspond to levels of fatty acids in the diet. The accumulation of palmitate, palmitoleate, and oleate in moth larvae of both the species was greater than linoleate and linolenate, suggesting a sparing effect by the former on the latter, more unsaturated fatty acids...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} food eaten by larval insects will affect traits such as gamete production, fat reserves, muscle bulk and body {{size in the}} adult. Moreover, larvae also depend on high {{moisture}} content in the diet for survival. The <b>almond</b> <b>moth</b> (Ephestia cautella) (W.) (Lepidoptera; Pyralidae) does not feed as an adult although it continues to drink water. We tested the idea that an <b>almond</b> <b>moth</b> could compensate for a low-water diet as a larva by increasing its water intake as an adult. We reared larvae on two different food sources with different moisture regimes; standard laboratory diet with glycerol (relatively wet) and standard diet without glycerol (relatively dry). Half the adult moths from each treatment were given water to drink before their first and only mating. Our results show that wet larval diets (i. e. containing glycerol) significantly decreased fecundity (total number of eggs laid {{and the proportion of}} hatched larvae), whilst it significantly increased male and female longevity. The interaction effect of water access for adult males and females was significant, independent of the glycerol in the larval diet. Longevity in females that were not presented with water as adults was slightly higher if mated with a male that had had access to water, suggesting a mating donation of water. However, females that received water as adults showed a decreased longevity if mated with a male who had also had access to water as an adult, indicating a negative effect of water if received by both males and females. In addition, when the larval diet included glycerol, increased number of eggs laid decreased female longevity, whilst an absence of glycerol in the larval diet resulted in low female longevity that was unlinked with fecundity. Glycerol is used in many artificial insect diets {{and the fact that it}} shows a strong effect on key life-history traits (reproductive output and longevity in this species), merits careful re-examination of its effects on these important traits in other laboratory models. We also discuss the possibility that larval diet can affect female reproductive decisions...|$|E
40|$|Wolbachia {{is known}} as the causative agent of various {{reproductive}} alterations in arthropods. The <b>almond</b> <b>moth</b> Cadra cautella is doubly infected with A- and B-group Wolbachia and expresses complete cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). The Mediterranean flour moth Ephestia kuehniella carries A-group Wolbachia and expresses partial CI. In the present study, the Wolbachia in C. cautella was transferred to E. kuehniella from which the original Wolbachia had been removed. We obtained transfected lines of three different infection states: single infection with A, single infection with B, and double infection with A and B. The doubly transfected lines and those transfected with only A produced exclusively female progeny. Two lines of evidence suggested that the sex ratio distortion was due to male killing. First, reduced egg hatch rate was observed. Second, removal of the Wolbachia from the transfected lines resulted in the recovery of a normal sex ratio of approximately 1 : 1. The occurrence of male killing following transfection showed that host factors influence the determination of the reproductive phenotype caused by Wolbachia. The transfected E. kuehniella males carrying exclusively B-group Wolbachia expressed partial incompatibility when crossed with the uninfected females. In addition, the transfected lines were bidirectionally incompatible with the naturally infected strain, which was the first demonstration of bidirectional CI in a lepidopteran...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe spatial {{distribution}} of eggs laid over a 48 -h period by individual female almond moths, Cadra cautella Walker (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), was examined in bioassays where peanuts covered either the center quarter (quarter-coverage) or the whole (whole-coverage) of a 120 -cm square arena gridded into 3 by 3 -cm cells. The mean total of eggs laid in quarter-coverage bioassays was {{not significantly different from}} the mean in whole-coverage bioassays, i. e., neither food coverage limited oviposition. However, the maximum count of eggs laid in any cell was higher in whole- than in quarter-coverage bioassays, and eggs were more aggregated near edges of the arena in whole-coverage bioassays than near edges of the peanuts in quarter-coverage bioassays. In addition, eggs were aggregated near the release point where females initially encountered food cues. These results suggest that <b>almond</b> <b>moth</b> oviposition behavior in continuous areas of peanuts was similar to patterns observed previously for stored-product insect oviposition in small, scattered food patches. In both cases, females walked or flew between separate oviposition events where eggs were laid in small clumps or lines. Possible behaviors resulting in aggregations of eggs near edges of food, walls, boundaries, or entrances are discussed and implications for precision targeting of insects in food storage areas are considered...|$|E
40|$|Three pyralid moths, the Mediterranean flour moth (Ephestia kuehniella), the <b>almond</b> <b>moth</b> (Ephestia cautella) and the Indian {{meal moth}} (Plodia interpunctella), infest food {{products}} {{all over the}} world and cause severe problems in factories, shops and households. For health and environmental reasons chemical control becomes more and more restricted. We here present some promising results offering efficient detection and control of these species based on semiochemicals. The pheromone mating disruption technique (MD) was employed in three mills, a chocolate factory, a pet shop and in a pet food warehouse during 7 - 21 months, including localities with infestations of all three species. Catches of monitoring traps decreased instantaneously and measured air concentrations of the main pheromone component, released form the MD-dispensers, increased immediately. Fewer moths were observed in the localities and the number of complaints from customers of mill products decreased. In the chocolate factory, it was possible to use traps baited with water to obtain an additional and independent measurement of the E. cautella population level. Catches in these traps showed a decrease in population density. From the MD-experiments we can conclude that this technique has a large potential for controlling all three moth species. For more efficient monitoring and evaluation of control measures, we have done a series of studies to improve pheromone traps and to make trapping of E. kuehniella and P. interpunctella females possible (E. cautella females are readily caught by water traps). Improved pheromone baits for E. cautella and P. interpunctella and potential female attractant blends will be presented...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the plume {{structure of a}} piezo-electric sprayer system, set up to release ethanol in a wind tunnel, using a fast response mini-photoionizaton detector. We recorded the plume structure of four different piezo-sprayer configurations: the sprayer alone; with a 1. 6 -mm steel mesh shield; with a 3. 2 -mm steel mesh shield; and with a 5 cm circular upwind baffle. We measured a 12 ?×? 12 -mm core {{at the center of}} the plume, and both a horizontal and vertical cross-section of the plume, all at 100 -, 200 -, and 400 -mm downwind of the odor source. Significant differences in plume structure were found among all configurations in terms of conditional relative mean concentration, intermittency, ratio of peak concentration to conditional mean concentration, and cross-sectional area of the plume. We then measured the flight responses of the <b>almond</b> <b>moth,</b> Cadra cautella, to odor plumes generated with the sprayer alone, and with the upwind baffle piezo-sprayer configuration, releasing a 13 : 1 ratio of (9 Z, 12 E) -tetradecadienyl acetate and (Z) - 9 -tetradecenyl acetate diluted in ethanol at release rates of 1, 10, 100, and 1, 000 pg/min. For each configuration, differences in pheromone release rate resulted in significant differences in the proportions of moths performing oriented flight and landing behaviors. Additionally, there were apparent differences in the moths’ behaviors between the two sprayer configurations, although this requires confirmation with further experiments. This study provides evidence that both pheromone concentration and plume structure affect moth orientation behavior and demonstrates that care is needed when setting up experiments that use a piezo-electric release system to ensure the optimal conditions for behavioral observations. <br/...|$|E
40|$|The pilot {{feed mill}} at Kansas State University was heated to {{temperatures}} of X 501 C for 28 – 35 h during August 4 – 6, 1999 using natural gas heaters to kill stored-product insects. A three-parameter nonlinear regression model satisfactorily described temperature profiles {{on each of}} the four mill floors and was useful in showing differences among floors in the number of hours taken to reach 501 C and hours above 501 C. Pitfall traps with food and pheromone lures and sticky traps with pheromone lures were used to sample adults of beetles and moths, respectively, between July 8 and December 1, 1999 to evaluate heat treatment effectiveness. A total of 32 insect species representing 26 families in seven orders were captured in traps. Immediately after heat treatment, there was 95 % reduction in total beetle captures in pitfall traps and 99 % reduction in moth captures in sticky traps. Trap captures of the <b>almond</b> <b>moth,</b> Cadra cautella (Walker) and cigarette beetle, Lasioderma serricorne (L.) were significantly reduced and remained low after heat treatment. However, trap captures of the flat grain beetle, Cryptolestes pusillus (Sch. oenherr), Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella (H. ubner), and red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) increased gradually after heat treatment, especially on the 1 st and 4 th floors. Our results indicated that traps are valuable tools for gauging the degree and duration of insect suppression obtained by heat treatment. In addition to trapping, visual inspection of the mill areas and absolute sampling of ingredients, products and spillage should be undertaken, so that areas of incipient insect reinfestation can be identified and potential problems rectified or averted...|$|E
40|$|Habrobracon hebetor Say (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a gregarious ecto-parasitoid that attacks larvae {{of several}} species of Lepidoptera, mainly pyralid moths infesting stored products. Host quality {{strongly}} influences the reproductive success of the parasitoid. In this study, we assessed the reproductive performance of the parasitoid, H. hebetor {{in a series of}} laboratory experiments using six different pyralid host species: Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hübner), Mediterranean flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella (Zeller), <b>almond</b> <b>moth,</b> Ephestia cautella (Walker), rice moth, Corcyra cephalonica (Stainton), navel orangeworm, Amyelois transitella (Walker), and greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella L. Experiments were conducted using petri dishes (100 by 15 mm) as experimental arenas at 29 ± 1 °C, 65 ± 5 % relative humidity, and a photoperiod of 14 : 10 (L:D) h. Two-day-old H. hebetor females were introduced singly into experimental arenas and given a single host larva every day throughout their lifetime. The numbers of hosts paralyzed and parasitized, numbers of eggs laid each day on each host, egg-to-adult survivorship, and progeny sex ratio were used as parameters for assessing host suitability. Paralysis of hosts by H. hebetor females was significantly affected by host species. H. hebetor paralyzed > 95 % of the preferred host larvae that were offered and also used ≈ 90 % of those for oviposition. Daily fecundity was highest on G. mellonella (22. 1 ± 0. 4) and C. cephalonica (21. 6 ± 0. 3), and lowest on E. cautella (13. 4 ± 0. 2). The egg-to-adult survivorship and progeny sex ratio were also significantly affected by the host species. The highest percentage of parasitoid survival was on A. transitella (75. 7 ± 2. 0) and C. cephalonica (75. 4 ± 2. 5), and lowest on G. mellonella (49. 7 ± 4. 8). Our studies clearly showed that H. hebetor females can paralyze and lay eggs on several pyralid species, but it cannot necessarily develop and reproduce optimally on all host species that it can paralyze and parasitize...|$|E
40|$|Moths use {{chemical}} signals {{emanating from}} food to find sites for oviposition and subsequent larval feeding. By identifying these odours, novel approaches to pest management can be developed, such as monitoring of females in pest populations. The pyralid moths studied in this thesis, the <b>almond</b> <b>moth</b> (Ephestia cautella), the Mediterranean flour moth (E. kuehniella) and the Indian meal moth (Plodia interpunctella) are severe worldwide pests {{of a variety}} of stored products. The aim was to find food-derived chemical signals that are attractive to and mediate oviposition behaviour in females. Both sexes of E. cautella and P. interpunctella were attracted to and landed on three chocolate products in a flight tunnel. Chocolate is mainly infested by E. cautella, but the chocolate products were also suitable food for P. interpunctella in our laboratory. Behavioural activity was also observed when testing extracts of the chocolate products. Three compounds were identified by mass spectrometry after electrophysiological investigation of the moths' antennae, i. e. ethyl vanillin, nonanal and phenylacetaldehyde. A blend of the three compounds evoked the whole behavioural sequence including landing rates corresponding to that of the chocolate products. Chocolate extracts were active on antennae of both sexes of E. kuehniella as well. This species is specialised on cereal products, making the responses to chocolate compounds unexpected, but the identified compounds, namely benzyl alcohol, nonanal and phenylacetaldehyde, might also be found in cereal products. The chemicals stimulated oviposition in E. kuehniella females when presented one by one. A blend of the three compounds trapped males in a small-scale trapping experiment in tents. The results from these two behavioural studies indicate that chocolate-derived volatiles might have a future in pest management of the moths. Water was attractive to E. cautella in a trapping experiment in a chocolate factory. The water did not trap any E. kuehniella when tested in a flour mill. Water is attractive to E. cautella since it is probably a limited resource for this species, whereas E. kuehniella is more adapted to dry habitats. Experience was shown {{to play a role in}} the search for food in E. cautella and P. interpunctella. The influence of exposure during adult emergence was most pronounced on the most crucial behaviour for larval viability, i. e. the oviposition. Flight behaviour, in response to food odours, was also enhanced by prior exposure during adult emergence and larval feeding experience had some enhancing effect on E. cautella flight behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Spinosad is a reduced-risk {{insecticide}} {{derived by}} fermentation {{from the soil}} actinomycete, Saccharopolyspora spinosa Mertz & Yao. Spinosad is currently registered in several countries as a grain protectant at a maximum labeled use rate of 1 ppm (1 mg a. i. /kg of grain) and with the Maximum Residue Level (MRL) or tolerance on grains set at 1 or 1. 5 ppm. Global launch of spinosad as a grain protectant is expected in the near future, pending final acceptance of international residue tolerances for spinosad by major grain importing and exporting countries. Spinosad effectively controls economically important beetle and moth pests associated with stored grain and is also effective against certain psocid species. Spinosad provides grain protection through control of adult and/or immature life stages of pest insects. The pest spectrum of spinosad under commercial grain storage conditions is still being defined, {{but it is clear}} from available laboratory and field evaluations on various grains that the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.); larger grain borer, Prostephanus truncatus (Horn); rusty grain beetle. Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens); flat grain beetle, Cry ptolestes pusillus (Schonherr); red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst); confused flour beetle. Tribolium confusum Jacquelin du Val; Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hubner); rice moth, Corcyra cephalonica (Stainton); Angoumois grain moth, Sitotroga cerealella (Olivier); <b>almond</b> <b>moth.</b> Cadra cautella Walker; and the psocid species Lepinotus reticulatus Enderlein and Liposcelis entomophila (Enderlein) are susceptible to spinosad and complete control is to be expected. Other pest species such as the maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais Motchulsky; rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L); and sawtoothed grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L) are susceptible to spinosad to varying degrees, but their overall level of control remains to be verified under commercial grain storage conditions. Spinosad residues are highly stable on grains stored in bins, with a length of protection ranging from 6 months to 2 years. Numerous factors have been shown to impact the overall performance of spinosad, including insect pest species, pest life stage, grain type, grain variety, and formulation type. Spinosad possesses a unique mode of action in insects and controls insect strains resistant to other grain protectants. When launched globally, spinosad will represent a valuable new addition to the limited arsenal of grain protectants and can positively impact global food security. Its combination of high efficacy, broad insect pest spectrum, low mammalian toxicity, and sound environmental profile is unique among existing products currently used for stored-grain protection.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the factors {{relating}} to insect infestation of produce manufactured at the Cadbury Schweppes' Tasmanian confectionery plant, in order to determine means by which the incidence of product infestation could be minimized. Analysis of the company's infestation-related consumer complaint databases revealed that: assortments (boxed-chocolates) were most likely to be infested; the geographic distribution of complaints was temperature-dependent; 'old' stock and/or produce manufactured during spring was most likely to be infested; infested goods were more likely to be purchased from smaller retail outlets and; the costs associated with infestation were substantial. Phycitine moths were almost exclusively responsible for infestation, and it was estimated that most cases of infestation occurred post-packaging, most likely while stock was in the hands of independent wholesalers and retailers. A small proportion of infestation probably originated at the Hobart plant, caused by a resident population of the <b>almond</b> <b>moth,</b> Ephestia cautella (Walker). This population was traditionally suppressed by the blanket application of synergised pyrethrins throughout the factory, although, an extensive pheromone trapping program indicated that the spraying of pyrethrins affected neither the distribution of E. cautella, nor the capture rate, and the distribution of E. cautella within the factory was primary dependent upon hygiene conditions. A single room within the factory was identified as the primary source of migratory E. cautella, and a control strategy, based on the mass trapping technique, successfully reduced E. cautella numbers in this room to negligible levels. The influence of trap design on E. cautella catch was also evaluated. Aspects of phycitine ecology with regard to the post-packaging infestation of produce were examined, and it was found that both adult and juvenile phycitines responded positively to odours escaping from chocolate boxes. The integrity of packaging significantly influenced the likelihood, and extent, of infestation, while the polyvinyl chloride film used to overwrap assortment boxes was found to be readily penetrated by several stored-product insect species. An alternative polypropylene film offered significantly improved insect barrier properties. A number of measures aimed at minimizing both pre- and post- packaging infestation were recommended. At the factory, it was recommended that an insect pest control strategy relying on advanced insect detection methods and improved sanitary procedures, supported by an appropriate management structure, be adopted in preference to the current chemical-based strategy. With regard to post-packaging infestation, it was recommended that wholesalers and retailers be educated about the dangers that stored-product insects pose to goods, and methods through which insect apparency can be minimized. It was also recommended that the utility of packaging materials and/or technologies that completely retained odours and provide superior insect barrier qualities be investigated. Also, that quality control procedures be implemented to monitor the integrity of product packaging...|$|E
