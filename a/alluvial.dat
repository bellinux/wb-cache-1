5|$|Platinum is an {{extremely}} rare metal, occurring at a concentration of only 0.005 ppm in Earth's crust. It is sometimes mistaken for silver. Platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum and as alloy with the other platinum-group metals and iron mostly. Most often the native platinum is found in secondary deposits in <b>alluvial</b> deposits. The <b>alluvial</b> deposits used by pre-Columbian people in the Chocó Department, Colombia are still a source for platinum-group metals. Another large <b>alluvial</b> deposit is in the Ural Mountains, Russia, {{and it is still}} mined.|$|E
5|$|The {{identification}} of stolen diamonds presents {{a set of}} difficult problems. Rough diamonds will have a distinctive shape depending on whether their source is a mine or from an <b>alluvial</b> environment such as a beach or river - <b>alluvial</b> diamonds have smoother surfaces than {{those that have been}} mined. Determining the provenance of cut and polished stones is much more complex.|$|E
5|$|The {{surficial}} geology near Shickshinny Creek mainly {{consists of}} urban land, fill, alluvium, <b>alluvial</b> terrace, <b>alluvial</b> fan, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Delta, Wisconsinan Bouldery Till, Wisconsinan Till, lakes, and wetlands. The lower {{reaches of the}} creek are in a water gap between Huntington Mountain and Shickshinny Mountain. A lake known as Shickshinny Lake is in the watershed and is dammed by the Shickshinny Lake Dam.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, Murray cod inhabit {{a remarkably}} {{wide variety of}} habitats, from cool, clear, fast-flowing streams with riffle-and-pool {{structure}} and rocky substrates in upland areas to large, slow flowing, meandering rivers in the extensive <b>alluvial</b> lowland reaches of the Murray-Darling basin.|$|E
5|$|Glaciation {{took place}} around the volcano roughly 6700 years BP, carving out U-shaped valleys. At the {{southwest}} {{flank of the}} island, a crater, likely a maar, can be found amid an <b>alluvial</b> plain.|$|E
5|$|In {{its lower}} reaches, the {{surficial}} geology {{in the vicinity}} of Shickshinny Creek consists of urban land highly disrupted by cut and fill, alluvium, <b>alluvial</b> terrace, fill, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift containing stratified sand and gravel, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Delta containing sand and gravel, Wisconsinan Bouldery Till (a glaicial or resedimented till containing boulders, and bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. The bedrock mainly occurs on the mountains {{in this part of the}} watershed. In the middle reaches of the creek, the surficial geology mainly features bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale, alluvium, and a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till. Some Wisconsinan Outwash and <b>alluvial</b> terrace is also present near Koonsville. Some patches of Wisconsinan Bouldery Till and wetlands are also present. In its upper reaches, the creek is almost entirely dominated by Wisconsinan Till, bedrock, and some lakes. However, there is a patch of <b>alluvial</b> fan immediately north of Shickshinny Lake and some Wisconsinan Bouldery Till and Wisconsinan Outwash not far from the creek's source.|$|E
5|$|In the Sybertsville quadrangle, the {{surficial}} geology in {{the valley}} of Little Wapwallopen Creek mainly consists of alluvium, <b>alluvial</b> terrace, <b>alluvial</b> fan, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, and some small patches of Wisconsinan Till. The surficial geology on the valley slopes and uplands mainly consists of bedrock. In the quadrangle of Freeland, the surficial geology near Little Wapwallopen Creek mainly features Wisconsinan Till, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, and alluvium. The surficial geology near the creek in the Wilkes-Barre West quadrangle mainly consists of Wisconsinan Till, with some scattered areas of bedrock and alluvium.|$|E
5|$|Once {{diamonds}} {{have been}} {{transported to the}} surface by magma in a volcanic pipe, they may erode out and be distributed over a large area. A volcanic pipe containing diamonds {{is known as a}} primary source of diamonds. Secondary sources of diamonds include all areas where a significant number of diamonds have been eroded out of their kimberlite or lamproite matrix, and accumulated because of water or wind action. These include <b>alluvial</b> deposits and deposits along existing and ancient shorelines, where loose diamonds tend to accumulate because of their size and density. Diamonds have also rarely been found in deposits left behind by glaciers (notably in Wisconsin and Indiana); in contrast to <b>alluvial</b> deposits, glacial deposits are minor and are therefore not viable commercial sources of diamond.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{quantities}} of Sarawak soil are lithosols, up to 60 percent, and podsols, around 12 percent, while abundant <b>alluvial</b> soil {{is found in}} coastal and riverine regions. 12 percent of Sarawak is covered with peat swamp forest.|$|E
5|$|Some eggs {{tentatively}} {{assigned to}} Macroolithus are {{known from the}} Wangshi Group in Laiyang, Shandong. The formations of the Wangshi group were deposited in <b>alluvial</b> fans, braided channels and shallow lakes. Common fossils include hadrosaurids and dinosaur eggs.|$|E
5|$|Taiwan's Austronesian {{speakers}} were formerly distributed {{over much}} of the island's rugged central mountain range and were concentrated in villages along the <b>alluvial</b> plains. The bulk of contemporary Taiwanese aborigines now live in the mountains and in cities.|$|E
5|$|The Shishugou Formation {{represents}} {{a variety of}} depositional environments, including <b>alluvial</b> fans and <b>alluvial</b> plains, streams, wetlands, and shallow lakes. During the time when Limusaurus lived, the environment would have been consistently warm and dry, judging by the abundance of coal and carbon-rich deposits. The climate was probably highly seasonal due to monsoonal influences, with warm, wet summers and dry winters. The climate enabled {{the growth of a}} richly forested environment; the forest would have been dominated by Araucaria trees, with the undergrowth being occupied by Coniopteris tree ferns, Anglopteris and Osmunda ferns, Equisetites horsetails, and Elatocladus shrubs.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of soil in the Languedoc varies from the chalk, limestone and gravel based soils inland to more <b>alluvial</b> soils near the coast. Some of the more highly rated vineyards are laid on top of ancient riverbed stones {{similar to those of}} Châteauneuf-du-Pape.|$|E
5|$|The {{district}} of Faisalabad {{is part of}} the <b>alluvial</b> plains between the Himalayan foothills and the central core of the Indian subcontinent. The <b>alluvial</b> deposits are typically over a thousand feet thick. The interfluves are believed to have been formed during the Late Pleistocene and feature river terraces. These were later identified as old and young floodplains of the Ravi River on the Kamalia and Chenab Plains. The old floodplains consist of Holocene deposits from the Ravi and Chenab rivers.|$|E
5|$|Within Earth's crust, osmium, like iridium, {{is found}} at highest {{concentrations}} in {{three types of}} geologic structure: igneous deposits (crustal intrusions from below), impact craters, and deposits reworked {{from one of the}} former structures. The largest known primary reserves are in the Bushveld Igneous Complex in South Africa, though the large copper–nickel deposits near Norilsk in Russia, and the Sudbury Basin in Canada are also significant sources of osmium. Smaller reserves {{can be found in the}} United States. The <b>alluvial</b> deposits used by pre-Columbian people in the Chocó Department, Colombia are still a source for platinum group metals. The second large <b>alluvial</b> deposit was found in the Ural Mountains, Russia, which is still mined.|$|E
5|$|A lack of {{preparation}} for the disaster contributed to the high death toll. Armero had been built on an <b>alluvial</b> fan that had been overrun by historic mudflows; authorities had ignored a hazard-zone map that showed the potential damage to the town from lahars. Residents stayed inside their dwellings to avoid the falling ash, as local officials had instructed them to do, not thinking {{that they might be}} buried by the mudflows.|$|E
5|$|Above the Lias is the Lower Oolite Series {{which are}} chiefly clays and oolitic limestone. The famous Bath Stone is {{obtained}} from the Great Oolite bed. Oxford Clay is the chief member of the Middle Oolite Series; and above this are the Upper Cretaceous rocks with Gault, Upper Greensand and Chalk. <b>Alluvial</b> flats and peat bogs occupy much of the centre of Somerset.|$|E
5|$|Almost all of Manila sits on top {{of centuries}} of prehistoric <b>alluvial</b> {{deposits}} built by {{the waters of the}} Pasig River and on some land reclaimed from Manila Bay. Manila's land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable land reclamation along the waterfronts since the American colonial times. Some of the city's natural variations in topography have been evened out. , Manila had a total area of 42.88 square kilometers.|$|E
5|$|Built {{on top of}} an <b>alluvial</b> fan {{that had}} been host to {{historic}} lahars, the town was previously destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 1595 and by mudflows in 1845. In the 1595 eruption, three distinct Plinian eruptions produced lahars that claimed the lives of 636people. During the 1845 event, 1,000people were killed by earthquake-generated mudflows near the Magdalena River.|$|E
5|$|Historically {{diamonds}} {{were known}} to be found only in <b>alluvial</b> deposits in southern India. India led the world in diamond production from the time of their discovery in approximately the 9th century BC to the mid-18th century AD, but the commercial potential of these sources had been exhausted by the late 18th century and at that time India was eclipsed by Brazil where the first non-Indian diamonds were found in 1725.|$|E
5|$|Located on the <b>alluvial</b> {{plain of}} the Nagara River, Gifu has taken {{advantage}} of the surrounding natural resources to create both traditional industries (including Mino washi and agriculture) and tourism opportunities like cormorant fishing. Mount Kinka, one of the city's major symbols, is home to a nationally designated forest and Gifu Castle, a replica of Nobunaga's former castle. Gifu also hosts many festivals and events throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|Most of Lower Silesia is {{a rolling}} plain of fertile land. It {{includes}} black and <b>alluvial</b> soils near Breslau (Wrocław) and in river valleys, mixed with more sandy soils. Located between the Oder {{river and the}} foot of the Sudeten Mountains, its mild climate, fertile soils and extensive water network made it a coveted agricultural resource.|$|E
5|$|Over about 80 million years, erosion {{caused the}} {{transportation}} of {{massive amounts of}} <b>alluvial</b> sediment {{to the floor of}} the Central Valley, where it was trapped between the California Coast Range on the west and the Sierra Nevada on the east, forming an incredibly flat and fertile land surface. The present-day form of the upper Merced River watershed, however, was formed by glaciers, and the lower watershed was indirectly but significantly affected.|$|E
5|$|Soils in the San Juan {{watershed}} {{are mostly}} sedimentary rock and are highly erosive, resulting in large <b>alluvial</b> deposits along floodplains. Soil {{types in the}} San Juan watershed {{can be divided into}} the Metz-San Emigdio, Sorrento-Mocho, Myford, Alo-Bosanko, Cieneba-Anaheim-Soper, and Friant-Cieneba-Exchequer associations, in order from low to high elevations. Steep hills in the San Juan watershed are prone to collapse during heavy rainfall or seismic activity.|$|E
5|$|The Sava River basin is very {{significant}} {{because of its}} biological diversity, and it contains large <b>alluvial</b> wetlands and lowland forests. This led to designation of six protected areas under provisions of the Ramsar Convention by {{the countries in the}} basin. Those are Lake Cerknica in Slovenia, Lonjsko Polje and Crna Mlaka in Croatia, Lake Bardača in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Obedska and Zasavica bogs in Serbia.|$|E
5|$|The central {{business}} district is focused around the commercial and recreational grid bounded by Best and Tarcutta Streets and the Murrumbidgee River and the Sturt Highway. The main shopping street of Wagga is Baylis Street which becomes Fitzmaurice Street at the northern end. The city is in an <b>alluvial</b> valley {{and much of the}} city has a problem with urban salinity.|$|E
5|$|The main {{geological}} outcrops {{around the}} lake are mudstone, largely consisting of red siltstone resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of sandstone from the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent <b>alluvial</b> deposits beside {{the course of the}} River Chew.|$|E
5|$|A small prickly leaved shrub between 0.2 and 3m (8 in to 10ft) high, G. juniperina grows {{generally}} on clay-based or <b>alluvial</b> soils in eucalypt woodland. The flower heads, {{known as}} inflorescences, appear from winter to early summer and are red, orange or yellow. Birds visit and pollinate the flowers. Grevillea juniperina plants {{are killed by}} bushfire, regenerating afterwards from seed. Grevillea juniperina adapts readily to cultivation and has been important in horticulture {{as it is the}} parent of many popular garden hybrids.|$|E
5|$|Big Run, a {{tributary}} stream of the South Branch Potomac River, flows north bisecting the Wappocomo property, bordered by dense foliage. Shortly before it enters Wappocomo farm, Big Run flows alongside ledges of gray shale known to contain Chonetes and Camarotoechia fossils. A smaller unnamed stream {{flows through the}} front lawn of the house at Wappocomo before curving northwest toward its confluence with Big Run. Corn is the primary crop produced in Wappocomo's agricultural fields along the South Branch Potomac River, which consist of rich <b>alluvial</b> soils.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{resident}} {{rainbow trout}} usually inhabit and spawn in small to moderately large, well oxygenated, shallow rivers with gravel bottoms. They are {{native to the}} <b>alluvial</b> or freestone streams that are typical tributaries of the Pacific basin, but introduced rainbow trout have established wild, self-sustaining populations in other river types such as bedrock and spring creeks. Lake resident rainbow trout are usually found in moderately deep, cool lakes with adequate shallows and vegetation to support production of sufficient food sources. Lake populations generally require access to gravelly bottomed streams to be self-sustaining.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{the bedrock}} of {{the west of the}} town {{consists}} of coal measures, which were exploited by the coal mining industry, while the east is mainly millstone grit. Overlying the bedrock are deposits of glacial sand and gravel, clay, and some <b>alluvial</b> deposits. Ashton Moss, a peat bog, lies {{to the west of the}} town and was originally much larger. The River Tame forms part of the southern boundary, dividing the town from Stalybridge and Dukinfield, and the River Medlock runs to the west.|$|E
5|$|Geographically, {{this area}} {{lies at the}} northeastern end of the Chota Nagpur Plateau, as it slopes down and merges with the <b>alluvial</b> plains of the Ganges. In the {{district}} there is only hilly area of natural rock formation situated near Dubrajpur town called Mama Bhagne Pahar (Hill). The western portion of the district is historically known as Vajjabhumi or Bajrabhumi. It is an undulating upland that is generally barren. The comparatively more fertile eastern portion, constituting the northeastern Rarh region, merges with the Gangetic plain. Vajjabhumi {{is included in the}} Rarh region, and the rest of Rarh is called Sumha to differentiate it from Vajjabhumi.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{diamonds}} {{were found}} only in <b>alluvial</b> deposits in Guntur and Krishna district of the Krishna River delta in Southern India. India led the world in diamond production {{from the time of}} their discovery in approximately the 9th century BC to the mid-18th century AD, but the commercial potential of these sources had been exhausted by the late 18th century and at that time India was eclipsed by Brazil where the first non-Indian diamonds were found in 1725. Currently, {{one of the most prominent}} Indian mines is located at Panna.|$|E
5|$|Platinum {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{reactive}} metals. It has remarkable resistance to corrosion, even at high temperatures, and is therefore considered a noble metal. Consequently, platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum. Because it occurs naturally in the <b>alluvial</b> sands of various rivers, it was first used by pre-Columbian South American natives to produce artifacts. It was referenced in European writings as early as 16th century, {{but it was not until}} Antonio de Ulloa published a report on a new metal of Colombian origin in 1748 that it began to be investigated by scientists.|$|E
5|$|Since {{settlement}} it {{has repeatedly}} flooded, sometimes with disastrous consequences. Adelaide's western suburbs were especially {{prone to flooding}} due to their location on the river's <b>alluvial</b> fan. As development of Adelaide progressed the amount of rainfall required for flooding decreased and consequent damage increased. Increased stormwater runoff, modification of the river's banks and other changes all served to exacerbate the problem. Work done by various groups to minimise flooding was often counter productive {{with the creation of}} levees, moving and widening channels and other works simply shifting the flooding elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Soil {{cover in}} the city region is {{predominantly}} sandy due to its proximity to the sea. In the suburbs, the soil cover is largely <b>alluvial</b> and loamy. The underlying rock of the region is composed of black Deccan basalt flows, and their acidic and basic variants {{dating back to the}} late Cretaceous and early Eocene eras. Mumbai sits on a seismically active zone owing to the presence of 23 fault lines in the vicinity. The area is classified as a Seismic Zone III region, which means an earthquake of up to magnitude 6.5 on the Richter magnitude scale may be expected.|$|E
