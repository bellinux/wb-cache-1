A number of mechanisms have been proposed, including the dehydration of clay-rich, gel-rich, or organic-rich cores; shrinkage of the concretion's center; expansion of gases produced by the decay of organic matter; or brittle fracturing or shrinkage of the concretion interior by either earthquakes or compaction (Pratt 2001; McBride et al. 2003).

The stability Cavallo's plan helped bring about, however, opened prospects for more privatizations than ever. Going on to total over 200 state enterprises, these included: the costly state railroads concern, the state oil monopoly YPF, several public utilities, two government television stations, 10,000km (6000mi) of roads, steel and petrochemical firms, grain elevators, hotels, subways and even racetracks. <b>A</b> <b>panoply</b> <b>of</b> provincial and municipal banks were sold to financial giants abroad (sometimes over the opposition of their respective governors and mayors) and, taking {{a page from the}} Chile pension system privatization, the mandatory National Pension System was opened to choice through the authorization of private pension schemes.|$|E
500|$|Massengale {{points out}} that in the Epistles, Bellman employs a variety of methods to make the poetry work. For example, in Epistle 35, Bröderna fara väl vilse ibland, Bellman uses <b>a</b> <b>panoply</b> <b>of</b> {{metrical}} devices to counteract the [...] "metrically plodding melody". He uses the rhetorical figure anadiplosis (repeating the last word of a clause {{at the start of the}} next) in verse 3 with [...] "...skaffa jag barnet; barnet det dog,..." [...] (...got I the child; the child died...) and again in verse 4. He uses epanalepsis (repeating the first word of a clause at its end) in verse 3, with [...] "Men, min Anna Greta, men!" [...] (But, my Anna Greta, but!), and again in verse 5. And he uses anaphora (repeating a word at the starts of neighbouring clauses) in verse 4, [...] "häll den på hjärtat, häll man fyra!" [...] (pour ... pour out four!), and again in verse 5. Massengale observes that good musical poetry, like this Epistle, is always a compromise, as it has both to fit its music or be no good as a musical setting, and to contrast with its music, or be no good as poetry. The final verse, containing all three metrical devices, is not, argues Massengale, an example of [...] "decay", but shows Bellman's freedom, change of focus (from lament to acceptance), and the closure of the Epistle.|$|E

To emphasize {{his role as a}} villain, Kishimoto worked towards making him appear [...] "pasty and sickly" [...] as part of his theme of distinguishing villains from the protagonists. In the series, Orochimaru is a former ninja of Konohagakure and a student of the Third Hokage. During his time in the village, he distinguished himself as one of the village's most powerful ninja along with his teammates, Jiraiya and Tsunade. His desire to obtain immortality and learn all known techniques led him to conduct experiments on other Konohagakure ninja, and to establish his own ninja village, Otogakure, as both his personal laboratory to continue his work and to amass a personal army to destroy Konoha with. His immortality technique involves transferring his consciousness between different host bodies, and his desire for a new host, particularly Sasuke Uchiha, is one of his driving motivations throughout most of the series. Because of his different host bodies and the disguises he assumes, <b>a</b> <b>panoply</b> <b>of</b> voice actors are used for Orochimaru; his voice actor for his normal form in the Japanese anime is Kujira, and his corresponding English voice actor is Steven Blum [...] except in the spin off Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals, where he is voiced by Vic Mignogna.|$|E

[...] She said [...] "where Tobey Maguire in the original Spider-Man trilogy was earnest, Garfield's Spider-Man is whip-smart and likably cheeky, with an undercurrent of teenage angst." [...] She also called the film [...] "as much a coming-of-age story as a crime-fighting action saga." [...] Christy Lemire of the Associated Press described Garfield's Spider-Man as an arrogant and misunderstood outsider, giving the film a [...] "restless, reckless energy and a welcome sense of danger." [...] She also concluded that Webb was a different sort of director, saying that while Webb's big set pieces lacked Raimi's imagination, they conveyed [...] "emotional truth" [...] and [...] "a pervasive sense of humanity". However, Ty Burr of The Boston Globe felt that the film lacked the original's pop grace and the pulpy joy, saying the film was [...] "dumbed down, tarted up" [...] and [...] "almost shockingly uninspired". Burr evaluated it as [...] "the worst superhero film since Green Lantern". Colin Covert of the Star Tribune also felt that The Amazing Spider-Man is weaker than its predecessor and described it as [...] "The Notebook in spandex". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt that the reboot provided better reasons for why Peter Parker adopts his superhero role, even if the origin story didn't need to be told once again. He also remarked that it was [...] "probably the second best" [...] of the four Spider-Man films after Spider-Man 2, explaining that Lizard was lackluster compared to that film's villain, Doctor Octopus, and had the dramatic range of Godzilla.|$|E
