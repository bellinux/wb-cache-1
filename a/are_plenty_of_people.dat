2500|$|Kessler said in {{his book}} that the {{measures}} Woodward took to conceal his meeting with Felt lent [...] "credence" [...] {{to the notion that}} Felt was Deep Throat. After Woodward confirmed that Felt was Deep Throat, the New York Post said on June 3, 2005, [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> claiming they knew Deep Throat was actually former FBI man Mark Felt... On May 3, 2002, PAGE SIX reported that Ronald Kessler, author of The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI, says that all the evidence points to former top FBI official W. Mark Felt." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mulholland {{has said}} her {{favourite}} character is Eliza Doolittle from My Fair Lady. [...] "I love her transformation from a rough and ready girl to a sophisticated lady". And she credits influences such as Julie Andrews, Judy Garland, and Dionne Warwick. She recalled the best {{piece of advice}} she received was: [...] "Believe in yourself. There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> in life waiting to knock you down {{but if you have}} confidence in your talent, in your own ability, nobody can take that away from you and you will succeed. Never give up. Learn from your mistakes and move on." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2011, MK Otniel Schneller (Kadima) said to Ben-Ami {{during a}} Knesset {{committee}} meeting: [...] "You are not Zionists {{and you do}} not care about Israeli interests. Fifty rockets a day are fired on the South and you fight against the American veto against condemnations of Israel. You are not Zionists {{and you do not}} care about Israel. Only here in Israel do we determine Israeli democracy, and you cannot determine what Israel's interests are." [...] Ben Ami responded by saying, [...] "An absolute parameter has to be the recognition of the fundamental right of the Jewish people to their own state. There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> even within the American Jewish community, who are anti-Zionist and who do not recognize that right. Second, they must recognize Israel's right to defend itself against threats – Israel must be strong, because it lives in a hard neighborhood, as we've even seen this morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There will <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> {{thinking}} <b>of</b> him,' said Mr. Cassilis. 'Egad! {{you gentlemen}} must stir yourselves, {{if you mean}} to be turned off. You will have rivals.' ...|$|R
60|$|The scandals {{about them}} were {{confirmed}} {{in the eyes}} of every one that looked on; for there <b>were</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> present in whose view of things the worst possible interpretation was the most probable one.|$|R
60|$|DANCY. I don't care a damn {{what people}} think monkeys and cats. I never could stand their rotten menagerie. Besides, {{what does it matter}} how I act; if I bring an action and get damages--if I pound him to a jelly-- it's all no good! I can't prove it. There'll <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> unconvinced.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{must take}} his chance," [...] Gerald replied. [...] "He's all {{right where he}} is. The car won't upset and there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who'll see if we get into trouble. Come, let's make a dash for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am not a}} traitor, Your Majesty," [...] protested Files. [...] "I {{resigned}} in a proper manner, not liking the job. But there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> to take my place. Why not make Shaggy Man the private soldier?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do {{you want}} to talk to me like that?" [...] Teddy cried, looking around in vain for a friend. [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> here who know me, for I live down at the Run, an' never swindled anybody." ...|$|E
60|$|Besides, {{there was}} still another {{important}} factor in the case. I knew well enough that if the money was not recovered, there would <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> mean enough to intimate that I had {{had something to do with}} its disappearance. The Strong honor was considered low by many, and they would not hesitate to declare that I was only following in my father's footsteps.|$|R
6000|$|Though Nature maintains, {{and must}} prevail, {{there will always}} <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> and good people, who cannot, or think they cannot, see {{anything}} in that last, wisest, most envelop'd of proverbs, [...] "Friendship rules the World." [...] Modern society, in its largest vein, is essentially intellectual, infidelistic--secretly admires, and depends most on, pure compulsion or science, its rule and sovereignty--is, in short, in [...] "cultivated" [...] quarters, deeply Napoleonic.|$|R
60|$|There {{are other}} things that will be stated in other volumes to follow. Don't be alarmed; there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> miserable <b>people</b> left.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is true enough," [...] Cuthbert laughed, [...] "but {{you must}} {{remember}} that critics do not buy either books or paintings, and that there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who buy the idiotic books and are perfectly content with pictures without a particle of artistic merit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear young lady," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "such {{questions}} are absolutely impossible! When a man comes on to a market, he comes on secretly. There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who {{would give you}} a handsome cheque to hear Mr. Wingate's answer to that question." ...|$|E
60|$|Why {{everybody}} should be indignant with me I could not comprehend. There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> {{who do not}} understand Scandinavian. It was absurd to be vexed with me because I did not. I do know a little, and {{that is more than}} some people do.|$|E
50|$|The quarry {{now had a}} name, but not the town, {{because there}} was no town, just the granite works and a {{railroad}} siding. Griffith’s employees all lived in the immediate area, so there <b>were</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> but no businesses outside of what amounted to a small “company store” near the quarry. The nearest supply centers of any consequence were Newcastle and Smithville, near present-day Loomis. Griffith’s early ledgers record numerous transactions at both places.|$|R
60|$|The negroes {{were all}} {{attached}} to the captain's domestic family. Maka and Cheditafa were not such proficient attendants as the captain might have employed, but he desired to have these two near him, and intended to keep them there {{as long as they}} would stay. Although Mok and the three other Africans had much to learn in regard to the duties of domestic servants, there would always <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> to teach them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn’t answer ’im a word. I might ha’ told ’im {{that there}} <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> arter me {{ready to give}} me double the money, but I knew he could never get anybody to do their dooty by the wharf like I ’ad done, so I kept quiet. It’s the way I treat my missis nowadays, and it pays; {{in the old days}} I used to waste my breath {{answering}} ’er back.|$|R
6000|$|... "And as for debts,--people, if they're called away by {{telegraph}} in a minute, can't pay {{all that}} they owe. There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> in Baslehurst that owe a deal more than he does, I'm sure. And he's got his share in the brewery, so that nobody need be afraid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Paros and Manuhungi--no entrances, no people. Nengo-Nengo is {{forty miles}} beyond them, in turn, {{and it has}} no people and no entrance. But there is Hao Island. It is just the place. The lagoon is thirty miles long and five miles wide. There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> You can usually find water. And any ship {{in the world can}} go through the entrance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, of course, {{there was}} the theory about the Prince and his suite, {{and to this day}} I fancy there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> in Liverpool, and also in London, who declare that the {{so-called}} Russian police officer was a confederate. No doubt that theory was very plausible, and Messrs. Winslow and Vassall {{spent a good deal of}} money in trying to prove a case against the Russian Prince.|$|E
25|$|There {{have always}} been {{politicians}} or business people who have wanted to cut the BBC back or stop it saying the sort of things it says. There's always been trouble about the licence and if you dropped your guard you could bet our bottom dollar there'd <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who'd {{want to take it}} away. The licence fee is the basis on which the BBC is based and if you destroy it, broadcasting... becomes a wasteland.|$|R
60|$|This is {{necessarily}} {{the end of}} Fantine. There are other things that will be stated in other volumes to follow. Don't be alarmed; there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> miserable <b>people</b> left.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{cousin was}} perplexed, and sad. 'There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> poor <b>people</b> in the town,' he said, 'many of them most {{interesting}} cases, {{and you could}} have the entire care of them all. There'd be no opposition whatever, I'm positive.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Curtis paused, Miss Wellwood was as pink as her cap strings. Rachel {{grasped the}} meaning at last. [...] "Oh!" [...] she said, with less reticence than her elders, [...] "there must needs be a spice of flirtation to give piquancy to the mess of gossip! I don't wonder, there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who judge others by themselves, {{and think that}} motive must {{underlie}} everything! I wonder who imagines that I am fallen so low?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed! Going to see {{the lovely}} Beatrice, I suppose. You had better be careful, Geoffrey. That girl will get you into a mess, {{and if she does}} there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who are ready to make an example of you. You have enemies enough, I can tell you. I am not jealous, it is not in my line, but you are too {{intimate}} with that girl, and you will be sorry for it one day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} safe now, mademoiselle," [...] he said to Marie, [...] "for us to proceed. There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> about in the streets; but as the news has, no doubt, already been spread that {{the daughters of the}} Marquis de St. Caux had left the house before those charged with their father's arrest arrived, it will be better for you not to keep together. I would suggest that you should walk on with Virginie. I will follow with Jeanne a hundred yards behind, so that I can keep you in sight, and will come up if anyone should accost you." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{night was}} warm, and there <b>were</b> still <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> about. A woman touched his arm; her {{hackneyed}} greeting {{filled him with}} inexpressible horror. He stared at her, barely conscious {{of what he was}} doing, filled with an indescribable sickness of heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} may not get into a scrape, Harriet, {{whenever}} he does marry;--I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife--for though his sisters, from a superior education, {{are not to be}} altogether objected to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates. There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman's daughter, and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power, or there will <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who would take pleasure in degrading you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some of 'em do, of course," [...] said Sally. [...] "You {{know there}} <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> busy <b>people</b> among them who go about working, read their Bible, an' {{try to make}} other <b>people</b> happy, so <b>of</b> course they must be happy themselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> {{who knew}} all about it; but such stories get packed away like old letters. They {{interest}} me. I like to know the manners of my time--contemporary gossip, not antediluvian. These Dryasdust fellows get a reputation by raking up some small scandal about Semiramis or Nitocris, {{and then we have}} a thousand and one poems written upon it by all the warblers big and little. But I don't care a straw about the faux pas of the mummies. You do, though. You are one of the historical men--more interested in a lady when she's got a rag face and skeleton toes peeping out. Does that flatter your imagination?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “She thinks so, {{but half}} the people don’t care for us. They’re not so good as we and they know it—I’ll do them that justice—so that they wonder why we should care for them. When we’re polite to them they think the less of us; there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> like that. Mamma thinks so much of them simply because they’re foreigners. If I could tell you all the ugly stupid tenth-rate people I’ve {{had to talk to}} for no better reason than that they were de leur pays!—Germans, French, Italians, Turks, everything. When I {{complain}} mamma always says that at any rate it’s practice in the language. And she makes so much of the most impossible English too; I don’t know what that’s practice in.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do," [...] Thomson asserted. [...] "It isn't {{only the}} fact of the attacks {{themselves}} miscarrying, but it's the knowledge {{on the other side of}} exactly how best to meet that attack. It's the exact knowledge they have as to our dispositions, our most secret and sudden change of tactics. We've suffered enough, Ambrose, in this country from civil spies--the Government are to blame for that. But there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who go blustering about, declaring that two of our Cabinet Ministers ought to be hung, who'd turn round and give you the life if you hinted for a moment that the same sort of thing in a far worse degree was going on amongst men who are wearing the King's uniform." ...|$|E
5000|$|From Bettina Federigi's diaries you {{can even}} imagine {{what was it like}} to be in such a {{dramatic}} situation. Saturday, July, 29th 1944Yesterday, at almost 6 pm, the Germans spread sheets reporting displacement order for the inhabitants. Time: until the first of August 1944. ... All the people I know run away carrying with them only few things; the Germans start shooting with their gun machines ..., they already blasted two houses ...How many people riversed in the streets, somebody's crying, somebody's screaming, calling, asking for a help. The German Command headquarter, where they issued the displacement sheet, <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> and their stuff. Many cannot manage to avoid the queue and demand for their safety pass. Bettina Federigi ...|$|R
60|$|Chickerel hastily entered with Mountclere, Sol joined them, {{and they}} sped on. Christopher drove close in their rear, not quite certain whether {{he did well}} in going further, now that there <b>were</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> {{to attend to the}} business, but anxious to see the end. The other three sat in silence, with their eyes upon their knees, though the clouds were dispersing, and the morning grew bright. In about twenty minutes the square unembattled tower of Knollsea Church {{appeared}} below them in the vale, its summit just touching the distant line of sea upon sky. The element by which they had been victimized on the previous evening now smiled falsely to the low morning sun.|$|R
5000|$|Overconsumption is {{the most}} {{significant}} concern associated with water consumption during marathons. Drinking excessive amounts of fluid during a race can lead to dilution of sodium in the blood, a condition called exercise-associated hyponatremia, which may result in vomiting, seizures, coma and even death. Dr. Lewis G. Maharam, medical director for the New York City Marathon, stated in 2005: [...] "There are no reported cases of dehydration causing death in the history of world running, but there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> cases <b>of</b> <b>people</b> dying <b>of</b> hyponatremia." ...|$|R
