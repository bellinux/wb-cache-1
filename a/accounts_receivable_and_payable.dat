50|$|A {{company can}} be endowed with assets and {{profitability}} but short of liquidity if its assets cannot readily {{be converted into}} cash. Positive working capital is required {{to ensure that a}} firm is able to continue its operations and that it has sufficient funds to satisfy both maturing short-term debt and upcoming operational expenses. The management of working capital involves managing inventories, <b>accounts</b> <b>receivable</b> <b>and</b> <b>payable,</b> and cash.|$|E
50|$|One {{measure of}} cash flow is {{provided}} by the cash conversion cycle—the net number of days from the outlay of cash for raw material to receiving payment from the customer. As a management tool, this metric makes explicit the inter-relatedness of decisions relating to inventories, <b>accounts</b> <b>receivable</b> <b>and</b> <b>payable,</b> and cash. Because this number effectively corresponds to the time that the firm's cash is tied up in operations and unavailable for other activities, management generally aims at a low net count.|$|E
5000|$|Notice how in year 2 {{when the}} payable is paid off, {{the amount of}} cash paid {{is equal to the}} forward rate of {{exchange}} back in year 1. Any change in the forward rate, however, changes the value of the forward contract. In this example, the exchange rate climbed in both years, increasing the value of the forward contract. Since the derivative instruments are required to be recorded at fair value, these adjustments must be made to the forward contract listed on the books. The offsetting account is other comprehensive income. This process allows the gain and loss on the position to be shown in Net income. The second is a fair value hedge. Again, according to IAS 39 this is “a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss”. [...] More simply, this type of hedge would eliminate the fair value risk of assets and liabilities reported on the Balance sheet. Since <b>Accounts</b> <b>receivable</b> <b>and</b> <b>payable</b> are recorded here, a fair value hedge may be used for these items. The following are the journal entries that would be made if the previous example were a fair value hedge.|$|E

In a second section we a basic reviews of subjects that will be needed for forecasting financial statements. We discuss the use of plugs for financial forecasting. We show an alternate approach to avoid such popular practice. The approach we propose follows the Double Entry Principle. This principle guarantees consistent and error free financial statements. We show with a simple example how the plug works and its limitations and problems that arise when using it. Next, the reader will find what information is needed for the forecasting of financial statements and where and how to find it. We present the procedure to identify policies that govern the ongoing of a firm such as <b>accounts</b> <b>receivable</b> <b>and</b> <b>payable,</b> inventories, dividend payout, and identify price increases and other basic variables. We also deal with the real life problem of a firm with multiple products and/or services.

We use a detailed example to illustrate the method. We derive the cash flows that will be used in the book to value a firm. This type of models might be used by non traded firm for a permanent assessment of the value creation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} how the Business Research program at Biola University can meet the needs of small business. The Business Research program originated at Biola University was a capstone course for all business seniors in which student consulting teams used previous classroom and book knowledge to analyze and make recommendations to small business firms selected by the faculty. An eighty-one item survey was administered by mail to forty-seven business firms which had participated in the business research course at any time during its seven year history. Responses from the thirty-eight firm administrators who returned the completed survey were analyzed with frequency distributions, measures of central tendency, Chi-square, Kendall's tau, a contingency table, and a summary of narrative statements. Conclusions(1) While Business Research students appear to benefit more from working with a corporation which contains a well developed management team, the client does not find student recommendations to be as valuable as a smaller, less sophisticated firm might. (2) Special emphasis should be placed on market research, relating to others, and ethical and moral values because clients appeared to value these skills and related them directly to their evaluation of the overall project. (3) As the program became more refined over time, businesses perceived faculty as more aware of business problems and found students better able to express themselves on paper. (4) Evaluation of teaching techniques in sales promotion, inventory control, <b>accounts</b> <b>receivable</b> <b>and</b> <b>payable,</b> computer usage, and information on competitors should be considered since clients tended to find student performance in these areas less than satisfactory.

40|$|Chapter 1 studies {{endogenous}} {{medium term}} cycles in a Schumpterian growth model. New firms {{are created by}} imitating existing firms and they drive the least productive firms out of business. In this manner, firm entry speeds up the process of creative destruction, reallocating economic resources from less to more productive firms. Furthermore, the rate of firm entry and intensity of reallocation are procyclical in this model, and therefore transient business cycle shocks are propagated into persistent medium term swings in productivity. While the model generates substantial amount of medium term cycles, their magnitudes are not as large as {{those found in the}} data. This is due to an endogenous tension arising from business stealing effect of Schumpeterian models that weakens the basic transmission mechanisms in this model. Chapter 2 develops a model of explicit marketplace competition between firms. Firms compete through technological innovation; a firm with superior technology captures larger market share and earns higher profits than its rival. Arrow's replacement effect in this model implies that industry followers have more to gain from innovations than leaders, and consequently followers invest more heavily than leaders. Therefore, followers derive higher proportions of their firm values from present value of growth opportunities, and this implies that technological leaders and laggards are value and growth firms, respectively. A novel, central empirical prediction of the model is that when realized return on the value-minus-growth portfolio is positive, value firms decrease their investments relative to growth firms, and vice versa. This prediction holds for capital expenditures, but not for R&D expenses in the data. Chapter 3 (joint with Yichuan Liu) presents three sets of empirical results pertaining to cross-sectional patterns in stock returns associated with various accounting ratios such as return on assets, return on equity, gross and net profit margins, and turnover ratios of <b>accounts</b> <b>receivable</b> <b>and</b> <b>payable.</b> First, we show that recent changes in these accounting ratios, rather than their levels, are responsible for large returns spreads. Second, we document fundamental momentum; long-short portfolios formed by sorting on recent changes in these accounting ratios have significant alphas after controlling for Fama-French three-factor and Carhart four-factor models. Third, we examine the findings of Chordia and Shivakumar (2006) who conclude that the well-known price momentum effect is a manifestation of earnings momentum. We find, on the contrary, that price momentum is not fully explained nor subsumed by earnings momentum. by Eung Jun Brandon Lee. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|In Chapter 1, I {{propose that}} {{abnormal}} returns generated by price momentum {{can be explained}} away {{within the framework of}} an existing risk factor model such as the Fama-French three-factor model. Two features of a systematic factor, weakly positive autocorrelation and the leverage effect, generate a small positive alpha in the factor portfolio scaled by its own past returns. The momentum portfolio magnifies this alpha by taking long positions in stocks with highly positive (negative) betas and short positions in stocks with highly negative betas given a positive (negative) realized factor return. Time-varying stock betas enhance the degree of magnification significantly. I demonstrate that a simulated market in which asset returns obey the three-factor model can produce realistic momentum dynamics and substantial abnormal profits comparable to those found in the data. In empirical tests, I show that a replicating portfolio with time-varying betas accounts for 84 % of the mean return and 75 % of the alpha of the value-weighted momentum portfolio. Among firms larger than the NYSE median, momentum has negligible return and alpha after taking into account the dynamic replicating portfolio. Among small firms, the addition of a financial distress factor is sufficient to explain away momentum alpha. Chapter 2 confirms the idea that momentum is a dynamic portfolio of existing risk factors and suggests that momentum profit should be positive and may be justified as compensation for risk. Using select factors extracted from principal component analysis, I can construct replicating portfolios that match the equally-weighted momentum returns and even achieve a higher Sharpe ratio, whereas previous attempts based on the Fama-French factors failed to do so. Analyzing the replicating portfolio reveals that momentum derives its returns from a diverse base of existing risk factors, proportional to the amount of cross-sectional dispersion in risk premia they can explain. Momentum returns are positive because it tends to have positive loadings on stocks with positive risk premia and vice versa. The numerous and constantly changing sources of momentum profit make it unlikely that a parsimonious model of a few long-lasting risk factors can completely explain momentum; in that sense, momentum may yet be considered a quasi-risk factor. In Chapter 3, a joint work with Eung Jun Brandon Lee, we present three sets of empirical results pertaining to cross-sectional patterns in stock returns associated with various accounting ratios such as return on assets, return on equity, turnover ratios of <b>accounts</b> <b>receivable</b> <b>and</b> <b>payable,</b> and gross and net profit margins.
