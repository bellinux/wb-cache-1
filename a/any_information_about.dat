5|$|After the incident, {{the event}} was halted for 15 minutes, until Vince McMahon and other WWF Corporate {{officials}} {{made the decision to}} continue the event. Hart's coworkers, professional wrestlers, and other miscellaneous workers, appeared somber after Hart's fall as they continued to do their jobs. An hour after the event restarted, Ross informed pay-per-view viewers that Hart had {{died at the age of}} 34 at a nearby hospital. The fans in attendance were not told <b>any</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> what had happened to Hart, and they did not hear the announcement of his death.|$|E
5|$|Several reviewers have {{likened the}} album to a bootleg. Neither Wheeler nor Parallel World {{provided}} <b>any</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the artists or {{names of the}} tracks. When re-issued in 2003, reviewer Mack Hagood criticized Parallel World for reifying its bootleg status by retaining the anonymous track list rather than working to look for surviving artists or their families, who would likely benefit greatly from royalties. With information more widely available on the Internet {{and the opportunity to}} collaborate, all tracks have since been identified.|$|E
5|$|Under US and UN pressure, Pakistan {{arrested a}} few members of Jamaat ud-Dawa and briefly put its founder under house arrest, but he was found to be free a few days later. A year after the attacks, Mumbai police {{continued}} to complain that Pakistani authorities were not co-operating by providing information for their investigation. Meanwhile, journalists in Pakistan said security agencies were preventing them from interviewing people from Kasab's village. Home Minister P. Chidambaram said the Pakistani authorities had not shared <b>any</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> American suspects Headley and Rana, but that the FBI had been more forthcoming.|$|E

5|$|The Assembly was {{strictly}} {{under the control}} of Parliament, and was only to debate topics which Parliament directed. Assembly members were not permitted to state their disagreements with majority opinions or share <b>any</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the proceedings, except in writing to Parliament. Parliament chose William Twisse, an internationally respected theologian, to be the Assembly's prolocutor or chairman. Due to Twisse's ill health, Cornelius Burges, whom Parliament appointed as one of several assessors, served as prolocutor pro tempore for most of the Assembly. Twenty-two appointed members of the Assembly died before 1649, and they along with those who did not attend for other reasons were replaced by another nineteen members. Three non-voting scribes were also added in 1643.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruins of}} three Byzantine-era churches {{are located in}} Bayt Jibrin. A church on a {{northern}} hill of the town, later used as a private residence, had elaborate mosaics depicting the four seasons which were defaced in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. A church south of the town, known as Khirbet Sandahanna, was dedicated to Saint Anne. The New Testament does not give <b>any</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> {{the mother of the}} Virgin Mary, but the widely circulated apocryphal Gospel of James gives her name as Anne, and her birthplace as Bethlehem. In another Christian tradition though, Bayt Jibrin is the birthplace of Saint Anne. The initial Byzantine church was rebuilt by Crusaders in the 12th century. Today, the apse with its three arched windows and half-dome ceiling are still intact.|$|E
5|$|West {{attacks and}} kills a {{fisherman}} in a wood, then encounters and frightens {{a little girl}} (Julie Drazen) there, but she escapes unharmed. Nelson tracks West by following his radiation trail with a geiger counter, but only finds his detached ear stuck to a tree branch. Perry arrives by plane, and is picked up by Nelson; shortly thereafter, they visit the crime scene where the fisherman's body was found. Sheriff Neil Blake (Michael Alldredge) suspects that Nelson knows something, but Nelson tells the sheriff nothing because Perry had earlier informed him that <b>any</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> West was classified. Later that night, Nelson returns home to his pregnant wife Judy (Ann Sweeny), who tells him that her elderly mother Helen (Dorothy Love) and Helen's boyfriend Harold (Edwin Max) are coming over for dinner. On their way, however, Helen and Harold are attacked by West in their car, and he kills them both.|$|E

25|$|All of the non-updated {{shares the}} {{attacker}} accumulated become useless. An attacker can only recover the secret {{if he can}} find enough other non-updated shares to reach the threshold. This situation should not happen because the players deleted their old shares. Additionally, an attacker cannot recover <b>any</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the original secret from the update files because they contain only random information.|$|E
25|$|In late 2006, the {{foundation}} {{sent out a}} holiday card featuring a picture of Electric Cord (1961), a painting that had been missing since 1970 after being sent out to art restorer Daniel Goldreyer by the Leo Castelli Gallery. The card urged the public to report <b>any</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> its whereabouts. In 2012, {{the foundation}} authenticated the piece when it surfaced at a New York City warehouse.|$|E

25|$|Healthcare in Canada is {{delivered}} through a publicly funded healthcare system, which is mostly free {{at the point}} of use and has most services provided by private entities. The system was established by the provisions of the Canada Health Act of 1984. The government assures the quality of care through federal standards. The government does not participate in day-to-day care or collect <b>any</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> an individual's health, which remains confidential between a person and his or her physician.|$|E
25|$|The {{book also}} {{presents}} evidence {{which suggests that}} Justice Minister Judith Collins leaked the name of public servant, Simon Pleasants, to Cameron Slater. Pleasants worked in the ministerial property department at Internal Affairs, and Collins assumed {{he was responsible for}} leaking details of Mr English's accommodation payments to Labour in 2009. Slater then published a series of blog attacks on Pleasants – who subsequently received a torrent of abuse including death threats. Pleasants denies ever leaking <b>any</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> English.|$|E
25|$|On 26 August, NBI {{reported}} that they had released the second suspect arrested on 23 August and cleared him of all charges. On 27 August, it was {{reported that}} Abderrahman Mechkah was not the main suspect's real name, nor was he 18-years old as previously thought. He was later confirmed to be 22-year-old Abderrahman Bouanane. On 29 August, however, Abdelhak Khiame, Head of the Moroccan Anti-Terrorism Intelligence Agency, informed the tabloid Ilta-Sanomat that his office did not have <b>any</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> a person of that name.|$|E

50|$|Thereafter, Muthuvelu and Kaveri fall in {{love with}} each other. At first, Kaveri's father Ramasamy (Shanmugasundaram) accepts for their marriage. Sundaram enters their home pretending to be Muthuvelu's father. Deivanai claims that he is not her husband, when Kaveri's father Ramasamy asks about her husband's identity, she refuses to tell. Ramasamy puts his foot down when she refuses to reveal <b>any</b> <b>informations</b> <b>about</b> Muthuvelu's father. Ramasamy is now {{grateful}} to Sundaram and he appoints him to work in his factory.|$|R
25|$|The Soviet {{leadership}} undertook extensive {{efforts to}} prevent the spread of <b>any</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the famine by keeping state communications top secret and taking other measures to prevent word of the famine from spreading. When Ukrainian peasants traveled north to Russia seeking bread, Joseph Stalin and Vyacheslav Molotov sent a secret telegram to the party and provincial police chiefs with instructions to turn them back, alleging Polish agents were attempting to create a famine scare. OGPU chairman Genrikh Yagoda subsequently reported that over 200,000 peasants had been turned back.|$|E
25|$|In decrees issued {{two days}} before the presidential election, the Afghan {{government}} imposed censorship for election day, barring news organizations from reporting <b>any</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> violence between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. out of concern that reports of violence could reduce voter turnout and damage chances of staging a successful election. Low turnout could undermine the credibility of the election – and could also hurt Karzai's results in the election if not enough ethnic Pashtun people, who form his base of support, turned out for the vote in the insurgent-dominated south of Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|Leibniz the philologist {{was an avid}} {{student of}} languages, eagerly {{latching}} on to <b>any</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> vocabulary and grammar that came his way. He refuted the belief, widely held by Christian scholars in his day, that Hebrew was the primeval language of the human race. He also refuted the argument, advanced by Swedish scholars in his day, that a form of proto-Swedish was the ancestor of the Germanic languages. He puzzled over {{the origins of the}} Slavic languages, was aware of the existence of Sanskrit, and was fascinated by classical Chinese.|$|E

25|$|Several European {{countries}} (particularly {{the former}} Soviet satellites and republics) {{have been accused}} of and have denied hosting black sites: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Armenia, Georgia, Latvia, Bulgaria, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. Slovak ministry spokesman Richard Fides said the country had no black sites, but its intelligence service spokesman Vladimir Simko said he would not disclose <b>any</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> possible Slovak black sites to the media. EU Justice commissioner Franco Frattini has repeatedly asserted suspension of voting rights for any member state found to have hosted a CIA black site.|$|E
25|$|The hostages' {{family members}} panicked as the {{government}} refused to release <b>any</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> which hospitals their loved ones had been taken to, or even whether their relatives were among the dead. The official number of the dead rose to 90, including 25 children, {{while it was still}} claimed that the final attack was provoked by the terrorists executing their captives. Later the same day, the official death toll among hostages had risen to at least 118 and the officials had not specified exactly what killed them. By 28 October, of the 646 former hostages who remained hospitalized, 150 were still in intensive care and 45 were in critical condition.|$|E
25|$|If a {{participant}} indicated a {{tip of the}} tongue state, {{they were asked to}} provide <b>any</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the target word they could recall. Brown and McNeill found that participants could identify the first letter of the target word, the number of syllables of the target word, words of similar sound, words of similar meaning, syllabic pattern, and the serial position of some letters in the target word better than would be expected by chance. Their findings demonstrated the legitimacy of the feeling of knowing experienced in a tip of the tongue state. This study was the foundation for subsequent research about tip of the tongue phenomenon.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, Pukeko Pictures and Heavy Metal {{magazine}} {{announced their}} intent to adapt Rat Queens as a 30-minute animated television series. There {{has not been}} <b>any</b> new <b>information</b> <b>about</b> {{the development of the}} series since.|$|R
