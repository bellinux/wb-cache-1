2500|$|From July 31, 2005 until September 2, 2017 the TTC ran a {{pilot project}} of {{time-based}} transfers on this route, under which passengers who take a transfer may disembark and then board another streetcar from the same route, even one going in the opposite direction, {{as long as they}} do so within a certain amount of time after their original boarding. This means that one can stop part-way through a journey and then continue, or even make a round trip, without paying multiple fares. Since December 14, 2015, passengers who pay the driver at the farebox are now required to obtain a time-based transfer as a result of the Proof-of-payment (POP) system now in place on all TTC streetcar routes as passengers maybe asked at anytime to show POP. (NOTE: The time-based transfer pilot is not available on the Presto card itself, meaning Presto users who wish to take advantage of this pilot project will need to board at the front door of the vehicle in order to obtain the special time-based transfer). This program will cease to exist as of September 3, 2017, when the new air-conditioned and accessible Flexity Outlook streetcars are rolled out onto this route, as drivers of the new streetcars are situated inside an enclosed cab meaning they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> fare collection or providing paper transfers.|$|E
