50|$|Peptides {{released}} {{near the}} median eminence from hypothalamic nuclei are {{transported to the}} anterior pituitary, where they <b>apply</b> <b>their</b> <b>effects.</b> Branches from the internal carotid artery provide the blood supply to the pituitary. The superior hypophyseal arteries form the primary capillary plexus that supplies blood to the median eminence. From this capillary system, the blood is drained in hypophyseal portal veins into the secondary plexus. The peptides released at the median eminence enter the primary plexus capillaries. From there, they are transported to the anterior pituitary via hypophyseal portal veins to the secondary plexus. The secondary plexus is a network of fenestrated sinusoid capillaries that provide blood to the anterior pituitary. The cells of the anterior pituitary express specific G protein-coupled receptors that bind to the neuropeptides, activating intracellular second messenger cascades that produce the release of anterior pituitary hormones.|$|E

The sample of this study consisted of third grade students of guidance school, and first and second grades of high school students of Isfahan. 100 students (50 girls and 50 boys) in the age range of 14 - 18 were randomly chosen and were asked to fill out the meta-cognitive questionnaire and Young questionnaire. The analysis of data showed that the total scores of maladaptive schemas had a negative and significant relation with the scores of meta-cognitive states (R= - 0. 22 and p< 0. 05). Multivariable regression analysis showed that among 16 available schemas, failure (R= - 0. 40, p< 0. 004), and emotional inhibition, (R= - 0. 42, P< 0. 002) in the boys, showed significant correlations with the total scores of meta-cognitive states. According to the findings, it seems that, the activation of failure schema in the girls, leads to the belief of being a failure and inevitability of failure, and the boys suffering from activation of emotional inhibition by which they extremely inhibit their emotion and action, in order to avoid the feelings of rejection and shame, are faced with deficits in meta-cognitive processing and have more cognitive and emotional distress during learning process...|$|R

Account for dynamic system elements, especially when in systems with minimum static pressure controls. 4. Consider changes in fan efficiency. 5.

In this work we biofabricated a thick dermal-like tissue by sequentially combining two steps: a μTPs production and assembly followed by tissue maturation in a purpose-built bioreactor. The μTPs were produced by first seeding bovine primary fibroblasts on gelatine microparticles and then cultivating them in stirring conditions until {{a thick layer}} of ∼ 80 μm of de novo synthesized extracellular matrix uniformly covered the microparticle surface.

However, the intimate mechanisms involved, {{as well as}} its effect on the production of signalling molecules associated with the host plant–AM fungus interaction remains largely unknown. In the present work, the effects of drought on lettuce and tomato plant performance and hormone levels were investigated in non-AM and AM plants.

AMplants showed an improved growth rate and efficiency of photosystem II than non-AM plants under drought from very early stages of plant colonization.

The levels of strigolactones and the expression of corresponding marker genes were affected by both AM symbiosis and drought. The results suggest that AM symbiosis alleviates drought stress by altering the hormonal profiles and affecting plant physiology in the host plant. In addition, a correlation between AM root colonization, strigolactone levels and drought severity is shown, suggesting that under these unfavourable conditions, plants might increase strigolactone production in order to promote symbiosis establishment to cope with the stress...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{recognized}} {{for some time that}} biogenic amines occur {{in a wide range of}} foods, among them meat and meat products. Meat is an important component of the diet in developed countries. The presence of these amines in food is of interest for two reasons: firstly, for toxicological reasons, in the sense that high levels of dietary biogenic amines can be toxic for certain consumers, and secondly, for their role as possible quality indicators. Based on these two premises, the present article offers a new analysis on aspects of toxicology and on the use of biogenic amines as a quality control method, as well as on their presence in meat and meat products. The article focuses particularly on factors affecting the production of biogenic amines, with reference to various parameters relating to microorganisms, meat raw materials, and processing conditions. A better understanding of the factors determining their formation (i. e., microorganisms, raw materials used, and technological processes <b>applied)</b> and <b>their</b> <b>effects</b> could lead to ways of controlling their production, limiting their presence in the end product, and hence, rendering them less toxic.

In this work we propose four novel techniques to speed up algorithms that solve the GA problem by exploring a search tree.

We formally prove that a GA algorithm that uses these techniques correctly computes the automorphism group of the input graph. We also describe how the techniques have been incorporated into the GA algorithm conauto, as conauto- 2. 03, with at most an additive polynomial increase in its asymptotic time complexity. We have experimentally evaluated the impact of each of the above techniques with several graph families. We have observed that each of the techniques by itself significantly reduces the number of processed nodes of the search tree in some subset of graphs, which justifies the use of each of them. Then, when they are <b>applied</b> together, <b>their</b> <b>effect</b> is combined, leading to reductions in the number of processed nodes in most graphs.

First, we treat the octahedral case for which the standard S. D. S model Hamiltonian cannot be applied due to a zero-field splitting {{in the absence of}} anisotropy induced by the spin-orbit coupling between the two spatial components of the (5) E(g) state at second-order of perturbation. Next, the symmetry is lowered to D(4 h) and D(2 h) and the anisotropic spin Hamiltonian is extracted using effective Hamiltonian theory. A simple relation is derived between the ratio E//D/ and the applied rhombic and axial distortions. Moreover, it is shown that close to O(h) symmetry, the orbital mixing due to spin-orbit coupling can be accurately described with Stevens fourth-order operators. The calculated tendencies are interpreted within a refined Racah plus ligand field model and it is shown that the ZFS parameters in Mn(III) complexes follow special rules that are nonintuitive compared to other d(n) configurations. Finally, some angular distortions are <b>applied</b> to study <b>their</b> <b>effect</b> on the anisotropy...|$|R
