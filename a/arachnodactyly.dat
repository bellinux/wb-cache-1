50|$|Marfanoid (or Marfanoid habitus) is a {{constellation}} of symptoms resembling those of Marfan syndrome, including long limbs, with an arm span that exceeds {{the height of the}} individual, and a crowded oral maxilla, sometimes with a high arch in the palate, <b>arachnodactyly,</b> and hyperlaxity.|$|E
50|$|Achard {{syndrome}} is a syndrome consisting of <b>arachnodactyly,</b> receding lower jaw, and joint laxity {{limited to the}} hands and feet.

5000|$|In 1896, Marfan {{described}} a hereditary disorder of connective tissue {{that was to}} become known as Marfan syndrome, the term first being used by Henricus Jacobus Marie Weve (1888-1962) of Utrecht in 1931. Today, {{it is thought that}} Marfan's patient (a five-year-old girl named Gabrielle) was affected by a condition known as congenital contractural <b>arachnodactyly,</b> and not Marfan's syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|Malouf {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} [...] "congestive cardiomyopathy-hypergonadotropic hypogonadism syndrome") is a congenital disorder that causes {{one or more}} of the following symptoms: mental retardation, ovarian dysgenesis, congestive cardiomyopathy, broad nasal base, blepharoptosis, and bone abnormalities, and occasionally marfanoid habitus (tall stature with long and thin limbs, little subcutaneous fat, <b>arachnodactyly,</b> joint hyperextension, narrow face, small chin, large testes, and hypotonia).|$|E
50|$|Along {{with his}} musical gifts, Rachmaninoff possessed {{physical}} gifts {{that may have}} placed him in good stead as a pianist. These gifts included exceptional height and extremely large hands with a gigantic finger stretch (he could play the chord C E G C G with his left hand). This and Rachmaninoff's slender frame, long limbs, narrow head, prominent ears, and thin nose suggest {{that he may have}} had Marfan syndrome, a hereditary disorder of the connective tissue. This syndrome would have accounted for several minor ailments he suffered all his life, including back pain, arthritis, eye strain, and bruising of the fingertips, although others have pointed out that this was more likely because he was playing the piano all day long. This Marfan speculation was proposed by Dr. D. A. B. Young (formerly principal scientist of the Wellcome Foundation) in a 1986 British Medical Journal article. Twenty years later, an article in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, by Ramachandran and Aronson differed greatly from Young's speculation:The size of Rachmaninov's hands may have been a manifestation of Marfan's syndrome, their size and slenderness typical of <b>arachnodactyly.</b> However, Rachmaninov did not clearly exhibit any of the other clinical characteristics typical of Marfan's, such as scoliosis, pectus excavatum, and eye or cardiac complications. Nor did he express any of the clinical effects of a Marfan-related syndrome, such as Beal's syndrome (congenital contractural <b>arachnodactyly),</b> Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, homocystinuria, Stickler syndrome, or Sphrintzen-Goldberg syndrome.

5000|$|Humans {{usually have}} five toes on each foot. When {{more than five}} toes are present, {{this is known as}} polydactyly. Other {{variants}} may include syndactyly or <b>arachnodactyly.</b> Forefoot shape, including toe shape, exhibits significant variation among people; these differences can be measured and have been statistically correlated with ethnicity. [...] Such deviations may affect comfort and fit for various shoe types. Research conducted for the U.S. Army indicated that larger feet may still have smaller arches, toe length, and toe-breadth.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the signs}} of MWS are present during the {{neonatal}} period. The most common signs at this state are multiple congenital joint contractures, dysmorphic features with mask-like face, blepharophimosis, ptosis, micrognathia, cleft or high arched palate, low-set ears, <b>arachnodactyly,</b> chest deformation as pectus, kyphoscoliosis and absent deep tendon reflexes are frequent minor malformations have also been described and consist of renal anomalies, cardiovascular abnormalities, hypospadias, omphalomesenteric duct, hypertriphic pyloric stenosis, duodenal bands, hyoplastic right lower lobe of the lung, displacement of the larynx {{to the right and}} vertebral abnormalities, cerebral malformations.|$|E
50|$|Prof. Munis Dundar MD, PhD (Turkish: Munis Dündar) is a {{professor}} of Medical Genetics and Head of the Medical Genetics Department at Erciyes University, Kayseri, Turkey. He is founder and head of the Medical Genetics Department at Erciyes University and has carried out various administrative tasks since 1996. He defined four genetic syndromes in the medical literature: the “Dundar Syndrome”, “Dundar Acropectoral Syndrome”, “Scoliosis, Blindness and <b>Arachnodactyly</b> Syndrome” and “Multiple Congenital Abnormalities and Mental Retardation Syndrome”. He has taken part as project coordinator and assistant investigator in many research projects and has prepared articles published in international journals since 1995. He is president of the EBTNA (European Biotechnology Thematic Network Association), and representative from Turkey.|$|E
50|$|TGF-β {{signaling}} {{also likely}} {{plays a major}} role in the pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome, a disease characterized by disproportionate height, <b>arachnodactyly,</b> ectopia lentis and heart complications such as mitral valve prolapse and aortic enlargement increasing the likelihood of aortic dissection. While the underlying defect in Marfan syndrome is faulty synthesis of the glycoprotein fibrillin I, normally an important component of elastic fibers, it has been shown that the Marfan syndrome phenotype can be relieved by addition of a TGF-β antagonist in affected mice. This suggests that while the symptoms of Marfan syndrome may seem consistent with a connective tissue disorder, the mechanism is more likely related to reduced sequestration of TGF-β by fibrillin.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are four}} {{recessive}} defects {{that can affect}} calves worldwide. A recessive defect occurs when both parents carry a recessive gene that will affect the calf.

50|$|Another {{suggestion}} by Burridge is that Akhenaten {{may have}} suffered from Marfan's Syndrome. Marfan's syndrome, unlike Froelich's, does not result in any lack of intelligence or sterility. It {{is associated with a}} sunken chest, long curved spider-like fingers (<b>arachnodactyly),</b> occasional congenital heart difficulties, a high curved or slightly cleft palate, and a highly curved cornea or dislocated lens of the eye, with the requirement for bright light to see well. Marfan's sufferers tend towards being taller than average, with a long, thin face, and elongated skull, overgrown ribs, a funnel or pigeon chest, and larger pelvis, with enlarged thighs and spindly calves. Marfan's syndrome is a dominant characteristic, and sufferers have a 50% chance of passing it on to their children. All of these symptoms arguably sometimes appear in depictions of Akhenaten and of his children. Recent CT scans of Tutankhamun report a cleft palate and a fairly long head, as well as an abnormal curvature of the spine and fusion of the upper vertebrae, a condition associated with scoliosis, all conditions associated with Marfan's syndrome. However, DNA tests on Tutankhamun, in 2010, proved negative for Marfan Syndrome. More recently, Homocystinuria was suggested as a possible diagnosis. Patients suffering from homocystinuria have Marfan habitus. However, as an autosomal recessive disease, it seems to fit better into Akhenaten's family tree — Akhenaten's parents, Amenhotep III and Tiye, were probably healthy, and Marfan Syndrome was ruled out following DNA tests on Tutankhamun in 2010.|$|E
5000|$|POR {{deficiency}} is {{the newest}} form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia first described in 2004. The index patient was a newborn 46,XX Japanese girl with craniosynostosis, hypertelorism, mid-face hypoplasia, radiohumeral synostosis, <b>arachnodactyly</b> and disordered steroidogenesis. However, the clinical and biochemical characteristics of patients with POR deficiency are long known in the literature as so-called mixed oxidase disease, as POR deficiency typically shows a steroid profile that suggests combined deficiencies of steroid 21-hydroxylase and 17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase activities. The clinical spectrum of POR deficiency ranges from severely affected children with ambiguous genitalia, adrenal insufficiency, and the Antley-Bixler skeletal malformation syndrome (ABS) to mildly affected individuals with polycystic ovary syndrome-like features. Some of the POR patients were born to mothers who became virilized during pregnancy, suggesting deficient placental aromatization of fetal androgens due to a lesion in microsomal aromatase resulting in low estrogen production, which was later confirmed by lower aromatase activities caused by POR mutations. However, {{it has also been}} suggested that fetal and maternal virilization in POR deficiency might be caused by increased dihydrotestosterone synthesis by the fetal gonad through an alternative [...] "backdoor" [...] pathway first described in the marsupials and later confirmed in humans [...] Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of urinary steroids from pregnant women carrying a POR-deficient fetus described in an earlier report also supports the existence of this pathway, and the relevance of the [...] "backdoor" [...] pathway along with POR dependent steroidogenesis have become clearer from recent studies. The role of POR mutations beyond CAH are being investigated; and questions such as how POR mutations cause bony abnormalities and what role POR variants play in drug metabolism by hepatic P450s are being addressed in recent publications. However, reports of ABS in some offsprings of mothers who were treated with fluconazole, an antifungal agent which interferes with cholesterol biosynthesis at the level of CYP51 activity - indicate that disordered drug metabolism may result from deficient POR activity.|$|E
5000|$|Congenital contractural <b>arachnodactyly</b> (CA) is a {{non-lethal}} {{autosomal recessive}} genetic disorder in cattle. [...] An autosomal recessive defect {{is a disease}} caused {{by the presence of}} two recessive mutant genes on an autosome. CA is classified as a heritable disorder of connective tissue, specifically a disorder of the endomysium and perimysium. The defect in the muscle connective tissue results in a reduced range of elastic extension. CA is also known as 'Fawn calf syndrome'. CA is predominately associated with Angus cattle, however it has also been detected in other Angus associated breeds such as Murray Greys. CA was first identified in Victoria, Australia in 1998. However, it has now been discovered in many other countries. CA calves are almost always born alive, most being able to walk and suckle on their mother's teat leading to their survival in the early stages, although around 20% of CA calves die soon after birth. Differences in phenotypes are not normally noticeable and the weight of new born CA calves are seen to be normal, this means that CA is not always recognised. [...] CA is caused by a specific error in the DNA. This means it can be passed on from parents to offspring. Any cattle known to carry any category one genetic condition such as CA cannot be registered with cattle societies. The carriers of category 1 defects are all identifiable in the Australian Angus database. CA calves that survive are exposed to joint dislocation and early onset of arthritis. This is a result of their flexible joint laxity. Although CA is not as severe as other genetic diseases in cattle such as Mannosidosis (MA), Arthrogryposis multiplex (AM), CA is nonetheless a cause of calf deaths in herds where prevalence of the CA mutation in the herd is high and carrier sires are still being used. Diagnosis of CA can be made with a physical examination of new born calves. This should be done in the first 24 hours after birth, preferably done by a veterinarian or experienced breeder. Despite the variations between severe and non-severe cases, CA is easily diagnosed in a live new born calf. Both males and females can be affected. The following symptoms are observed: congenital proximal limb contracture, congenital distal limb hyperextension, congenital kyphosis and significant postnatal improvement in these clinical signs as the calf grows and matures. CA is not a difficult diagnosis however it requires careful physical examination of the calf followed by constant observation for improvement. Additional signs are present in the calves CA causes but can be more difficult to identify especially in mild cases. These include abnormal long leg bones resulting in a tall stature, loose jointedness, poor muscling and knee knocking [...] To prevent cattle being affected by CA, sires should be pedigree analysed to minimise the chance of the mutation. If CA is identified in a herd, other bloodlines which have tested negative for CA should be purchased. Some predominant Angus sires identified with CA are Rambo 465T of JRS, Te Mania Kelp K207, Bon View Bando 598, SAF 598 Bando 5175 and Boyd On Target 1083.|$|E

40|$|In {{this report}} we have {{described}} an affected sib {{in a large}} Turkish family who {{appears to have a}} new distinct dominantly-inherited blindness, scoliosis and <b>arachnodactyly</b> syndrome. The combination of clinical abnormalities in these patients did not initially suggest Marfan syndrome or other connective tissue disorders associated with ectopia lentis. The proband was a 16 -year-old boy who was referred to our clinics for scoliosis. He had <b>arachnodactyly</b> of both fingers and toes. He had been suffering from progressive visual loss and strabismus since he was eight-years-old. His 20 -year-old brother had severe kyphoscoliosis, and <b>arachnodactyly</b> of fingers and toes. He was 130 cm tall and was bilaterally blind. His 23 -year-old sister had only eye findings but no <b>arachnodactyly</b> or scoliosis. His 60 -year-old father had mild scoliosis, blindness and <b>arachnodactyly</b> and mother was normal. We performed routine mutation analyses in the genes FBN 1, TGFBR 1 and TGFBR 2, but no mutation has been detected. Our Turkish patients are most likely affected by a hitherto unrecorded condition which is caused by an autosomal dominant gene defect with variable expression but we can not exclude multigenic inheritance. Further studies are needed to assess the contribution of sex influence to the syndrome because the female relative is less affected...|$|E
