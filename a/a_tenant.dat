5|$|In the Greco-Roman {{world of}} Classical antiquity, Roman {{agriculture}} {{was built on}} techniques originally pioneered by the Sumerians, transmitted to them by subsequent cultures, with a specific emphasis on the cultivation of crops for trade and export. The Romans {{laid the groundwork for}} the manorial economic system, involving serfdom, which flourished in the Middle Ages. The farm sizes in Rome can be divided into three categories. Small farms were from 18-88 iugera (one iugerum is equal to about 0.65 acre). Medium-sized farms were from 80-500 iugera (singular iugerum). Large estates (called latifundia) were over 500 iugera. The Romans had four systems of farm management: direct work by owner and his family; slaves doing work under supervision of slave managers; tenant farming or sharecropping in which the owner and <b>a</b> <b>tenant</b> divide up a farm’s produce; and situations in which a farm was leased to <b>a</b> <b>tenant.</b>|$|E

In the 1920s the house was renovated, the stable block turned into a residence and several outbuildings, gardens and gateways constructed.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp is {{sometimes}} known as Walter de Beauchamp of Elmley, to distinguish {{him from the}} members of the Beauchamp family of Bedford. He married the daughter of Urse d'Abetot, who is usually named Emeline, although her name is not given in contemporary records. Urse d'Abetot was the Sheriff of Worcestershire from around 1069 to around 1108. Beauchamp may have been <b>a</b> <b>tenant</b> of his father-in-law prior to his marriage. Nothing is known for sure of Beauchamp's background, and he first witnessed a royal charter sometime between 1108 and 1111. Some documents suggest that his father may have been named Peveral de Beauchamp and that he had a brother named William Peveral de Beauchamp, but the only identifiable Peveral is younger than Walter.|$|E

A new grandstand with roof was completed in 1962, and floodlights were installed in 1968. The oldest of the current stands were built in 1996, along with new lighting. Three more grandstands were built between 2000 and 2002, which also saw {{the removal of the}} athletics facilities and the sale of the stadium from Trondheim Municipality to Rosenborg. Further expansions plans have been launched, to increase capacity by filling in the corners and possibly by building a retractable roof.|$|E
5|$|Sometime between 1130 and 1133, Beauchamp {{died and}} his son William de Beauchamp took over his lands.

The {{historian}} David Crouch says that another son was Walter, who is recorded as William's brother and was a follower of Waleran, Count of Meulan.
