40|$|In this study, {{we design}} and {{construct}} a {{solid fuel rocket}} that utilizes an ammonium perchlorate composite propellant. We also design and simulate an <b>air</b> <b>augmented</b> <b>rocket,</b> {{an example of a}} combined cycle. The results show that the primary solid fuel rocket acted in accordance with the theoretical model. The primary rocket achieved a thrust force of 48. 64 lbf and 57. 96 lbf in two separate tests, compared to the theoretical value of 51. 07 lbf. The discrepancies between these values can be attributed to non-idealities in the nozzle flow. The ideal specific impulse for the rocket was computed as 167. 0 s. Two types of air augmented rockets, a high and low bypass type, were simulated in SolidWorks' Floxpress CFD code. The high bypass <b>air</b> <b>augmented</b> <b>rocket</b> showed promising results in the simulation, as it produced a thrust force of 107. 77 lbf, and had a specific impulse of 265 s. The low bypass <b>air</b> <b>augmented</b> <b>rocket</b> was not very efficient, producing a thrust of 43. 5 lbf and a specific impulse of 107. 0 s. The drag force of the air augmented rockets were significantly higher than the original single stage rocket, and this can be attributed to poor aerodynamic design. The net force for the primary rocket, the high and low bypass air augmented rockets were 34. 9 lbf, 35. 6 lbf, and - 27. 2 lbf, respectively.

40|$|Abstract] A vital {{technical}} {{problem to}} be tackled {{in the development of}} advanced air breathing propulsion systems like <b>air</b> <b>augmented</b> <b>rockets</b> and dual mode combustion ramjets is the enhancement of mixing between two high speed gaseous streams. A radially lobbed nozzle is a potential candidate to enhance the mixing of two supersonic streams. In this study a computational work is carried out on supersonic mixing using a new radially lobbed nozzle called clover nozzle. Three-dimensional, compressible Navier-Stokes equations discretized using a coupled implicit finite volume method are used. Mixing characteristics of two types of clover nozzles are studied. The mixing is characterized by a parameter called momentum flux. The result has been compared with a conventional conical nozzle of same throat diameter and experimental results. The stagnation pressure loss is also analyzed. The result shows a complete mixing of the streams with marginal stagnation pressure loss within a short mixing length...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{air-breathing}} {{rocket engine}} inhales oxygen {{from the air}} for about half the flight, so it doesn't have to store the gas onboard. So at take-off, an air-breathing rocket weighs much less than a conventional rocket, which carries all of its fuel and oxygen onboard. Air breathing rockets, combine the performance characteristics of both rocket and ramjet engines. An air-breathing engine gets its initial take-off power from specially designed rockets, called air-augmented rockets, that boost performance about 15 percent over conventional rockets. When the vehicle's velocity reaches twice the speed of sound, the rockets are turned off and the engine relies totally on oxygen in the atmosphere to burn the hydrogen fuel. Once the vehicle's speed increases to about 10 times the speed of sound, the engine converts to a conventional rocket-powered system to propel the vehicle into orbit. And therefore reducing a vehicle's weight decreases cost significantly. And since an air breathing engine cannot get required initial take off thrust, various launch types like <b>air</b> <b>augmented</b> <b>rockets,</b> horizontal launch mode courtesy hybrid engine, magnetic levitation launch systems are used for initial thrust requirements,thus reducing fuel emissions and increases net efficiency of rockets. Hence air breathing engines can be implemented to address energy considerations and reduce costs...|$|R

40|$|An Axisymmetric Rocket Ejector Simulation (ARES) was {{developed}} to numerically analyze various configurations of an <b>air</b> <b>augmented</b> <b>rocket.</b> Primary and secondary flow field visualizations are presented and performance predictions are tabulated. A parametric study on ejector geometry is obtained following a validation of the flow fields and performance values. The primary flow is calculated using a quasi- 2 D, irrotational Method of Characteristics and the secondary flow is found using isentropic relations. Primary calculations begin at the throat and extend through the nozzle {{to the location of}} the first Mach Disk. Combustion properties are tabulated before analysis to allow for propellant property selection. Secondary flow calculations employ the previously calculated plume boundary and ejector geometry to form an isentropic solution. Primary and secondary flow computations are iterated along the new pressure distributions established by the 1 D analysis until a convergence tolerance is met. Thrust augmentation and Specific Impulse values are predicted using a control volume approach. For the validation test cases, the nozzle characteristic net is very similar to that of previous research. Plume characteristics are in good agreement but fluctuate in accuracy due to flow structure formulation. The individual unit processes utilized by the Method of Characteristics are found to vary their outputs by up to 0. 025 % when compared to existing sources. Rocket thrust and specific impulse are increased by up to 22 % for a static system and 15 % for an ejector flow at Mach 0. 5. Evidence of Fabri conditions were observed in the flow visualization and graphically through the performance predictions. It was determined that the optimum ejector divergence angle for an <b>air</b> <b>augmented</b> <b>rocket</b> greatly depends on the stagnation pressure ratio between the primary and secondary flows...|$|E

The primary rocket ejector was supplied with high pressure nitrogen at a maximum chamber pressure of 1758 psia {{and a maximum}} mass flow rate of 1. 4 lb/s. The secondary flow air was entrained from a fixed volume plenum chamber producing pressures as low as 3. 3 psia. The maximum total pressure ratio achieved was 221. The original CPAAR apparatus was rebuilt re-instrumented and capability expanded. A fixed volume plenum {{was attached to the}} secondary ducts through a constant area square section to mimic the cross section of the secondary ducts with a bell mouth inlet. The mixing duct length was increased from 8 in. to 18 in. An investigation of the mixing duct flow-field was done with data from pressure and temperature instrumentation. A study of the transient operation of the rocket was compared with results from former research to qualify the quasi-steady assumption of the flow-field. The CPAAR produced Fabri-choked operation, the startup transient observed caused the secondary flow to become established during Fabri-choke mode operation. The supersonic saturated mode was not observed during quasi-steady operation. The quasi-steady operation was defined based on characteristics from previous quasi-steady models of transient operation of supersonic ejectors. The measurement of the data during testing resulted in a 2. 96 % experimental uncertainty in the entrainment ratio calculation. The smallest entrainment ratio observed was 0. 05 at a total pressure ratio of 220. The location of the Fabri-choke point was shown through the interpretation of the primary and secondary flow {{as a result of the}} pressure and temperature measurements. The experimental evidence showed the location of the secondary choke point has a logarithmic relationship with the total pressure ratio. At a total pressure ratio of 220, the area of the aerodynamic throat of the secondary flow is 0. 26 in 2 and the location occurs 6 inches downstream from the nozzle exit. The secondary flow un-choke is related to the breakdown of the shock structure of the primary flow and produces a flow-field asymmetry which blocks the right duct flow. The CPSE simulation was unable to accurately predict AAR performance when the inputs are changed from the original CPAAR configuration. At high pressure ratios (PR= 220), the error in the prediction is 90 %...|$|E

40|$|Cold-flow {{tests were}} {{performed}} using a simulated <b>Air</b> <b>Augmented</b> <b>Rocket</b> (AAR) operating as a mixer-ejector {{in order to}} investigate the effects of varied primary nozzle lip thickness on mixing and entrainment. The simulated primary rocket ejector was supplied with nitrogen at a maximum chamber stagnation pressure of 1712 psi, and maximum flow rate of 1. 67 lbm/s. Secondary air was entrained from a plenum, producing pressures as low as 6. 8 psi and yielding maximum stagnation pressure ratios as high as 160. The primary ejector nozzles each had an area ratio of approximately 20, yielding average primary exit Mach numbers between 4. 34 and 4. 57. The primary flow was ejected into an 18. 75 inch-long mixing duct with a rectangular cross-sectional area of 2. 10 in 2. The secondary flow was entrained into the mixing duct through a total cross section of 0. 94 in 2. Two mixing duct configurations were used, one with plexiglass upper and lower surfaces for flow visualization and one with pressure ports along the lower surface for primary plume measurements. Shadowgraph images were used to characterize the mixing duct flow field, while pressure and temperature instrumentation allowed for calculation of various ejector performance characteristics. Experimentally-calculated performance characteristics were compared to inviscid theoretical predictions. Varying degrees of flow field asymmetry were observed with each nozzle. Test repeatability {{was found to be}} excellent for all nozzles. Several distinct phenomena were observed in both the primary plume and secondary streams. The duration of secondary flow choking was found to be inversely proportional to nozzle lip thickness, due to the primary plume being physically closer to the secondary flow with a thinner nozzle lip. This indicated that the ejectorâs ability to choke the secondary flow is primarily an inviscid phenomenon. Secondary flow blockage was demonstrated in two consecutive tests using the thickest nozzle lip. Only the left secondary duct became blocked in each case. Blockage was only demonstrated in the centerline pressure configuration, so no visual evidence was able to support the blocked flow theory. At every pressure ratio, entrainment ratio was shown to increase with nozzle lip thickness. The original conical nozzle produced the largest level of entrainment, indicating that the angle of primary flow impingement was the largest contributing factor to secondary entrainment. The increase in efficiency resulting from a bell-mouth nozzle was less than the increase in entrainment efficiency of a conical nozzle, indicating that the conical design was more efficient overall for <b>air</b> <b>augmented</b> <b>rocket</b> applications...|$|E

40|$|A hot-flow {{axisymmetric}} <b>Air</b> <b>Augmented</b> <b>Rocket</b> (AAR) {{test apparatus}} was constructed to test various mixing duct configurations at static conditions. Primary flow for the AAR was provided through a liquid methanol-gaseous oxygen bipropellant rocket. Experimental thrust measurements were recorded and propellant {{mass flow rate}}s and chamber conditions were calculated using an iterative solver dependant on recorded propellant line stagnation pressures. Primary rocket flow produced thrust ranging from 14 to 17. 9 lbf. Primary mass flow rate through testing ranged from 0. 071 to 0. 085 lbm/s with calculated chamber pressures between 298 - 362 psia. Calculated primary flow velocity ranged from 6, 600 ft/s to 8, 000 ft/s depending on propellant pressure inputs and calculated chamber conditions. The AAR test apparatus was capable of testing various mixing duct geometries and measuring the axial thrust of the mixing ducts separately from the total thrust of the system. Two mixing duct geometries, a straight wall mixing duct and diverging wall mixing duct, with identical exterior dimensions and inlet geometry were tested {{for a range of}} air/fuel mixture ratios from 0. 82 to 2. 2 spanning the stoichometric mixture ratio of 1. 5. Mixing duct thrust did not vary greatly with primary flow characteristics. Straight mixing duct thrust averaged 0. 97 lbf and diverging mixing duct thrust averaged 0. 18 lbf. Total system thrust decreased by an average of 0. 62 lbf with a straight mixing duct and 0. 74 lbf with a diverging mixing duct. Decreases in total thrust are attributed to low pressure flow interaction between the mixing duct and the primary rocket assembly. Visual flow comparison between mixing duct configurations and fuel ratio cases were carried out using high definition video recording with a grid reference for comparison. The diverging mixing duct produced the greatest variation in visible flow when compared to a straight mixing duct and no mixing duct configuration. This indicated that the diverging mixing duct had a greater influence on primary and secondary flow field mixing than the straight mixing duct...|$|E

40|$|Performance {{characterization}} {{was undertaken}} for an <b>air</b> <b>augmented</b> <b>rocket</b> mixing duct with annular cavity configurations intended to produce thrust augmentation. Three mixing duct geometries and a fully annular cavity {{at the exit}} of the nozzle were tested to enable thrust comparisons. The rocket engine used liquid ethanol and gaseous oxygen, and was instrumented with sensors to output total thrust, mixing duct thrust, combustion chamber pressure, and propellant differential pressures across Venturi flow measurement tubes. The rocket engine was tested to thrust maximum, with three different mixing ducts, three major combustion pressure sets, and a nozzle exit plane annular cavity (a grooved ring). The combustion pressures tested were,, and allowing for a nozzle pressure ratio range of relative to ambient pressure. The mixture ratio was fuel rich throughout all tests. The engine operated very consistently throughout all the tests performed; however, pressure losses in the feed system prevented higher combustion pressures from being tested. Three mixing ducts of the same outer diameter were tested. The short and diverging ducts were the same length and the long duct was long. The short and long ducts created positive mixing duct thrust and the diverging duct created negative mixing duct thrust. The long duct case did show better performance than the no duct case when the total thrust was divided by combustion pressure and nozzle throat area. The long duct always created several times more mixing duct thrust than either the short or diverging ducts, {{but none of the}} mixing ducts created positive overall thrust augmentation in the over expanded cases tested. The mixing duct thrusts ranged between and. As the combustion pressures were increased, getting closer the nozzleâs optimal expansion, the mixing duct thrusts started converging indicating a difference between nozzle operation at over expanded and under expanded. The annular cavity had a noticeable effect on the thrust of the engine and the appearance of the plume. The total thrust of the system was decreased by a maximum of and the plume was more sharply defined when the annular cavity was attached. Better mixing between the primary (engine exhaust) flow and the secondary (ambient air) flow was promoted by the annular cavity because it increased the shear layerâs turbulence and the increased turbulence reduced thrust. The greater mixing also allowed for secondary combustion which made the plumes more sharply defined. The annular cavity was also seen to enhance the mixing duct thrusts for all three mixing ducts...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} on the Cal Poly <b>air</b> <b>augmented</b> <b>rocket</b> (AAR) in order to characterize two-dimensional flowfield phenomenon occurring in the mixing duct. The testing utilized a direct connect system where high pressure nitrogen is fed into the combustion chamber, to form a primary flow. The high pressure nitrogen is then expanded through a nozzle, with an area ratio of 22 and an exit area of 0. 75 in 2, up to Mach 4. 3. Secondary air is entrained from a plenum chamber {{which is used to}} create a lower stagnation pressure for the secondary flow. The two flows mix in a duct that has a cross sectional area of 2. 06 in 2. The maximum pressure ratio, the ratio of primary to secondary stagnation pressure, achieved during testing was 132. The stagnation pressures of the primary and secondary flows are transient throughout the test. The quasi-steady portion of each run increased with increasing pressure ratio. Pressure and temperature measurements were collected from ten test runs. Shadowgraph images were taken of the mixing duct during testing in order to image the interactions between the primary and secondary flows. The images show an oblique shock forming in the primary flow. The angle of the shock matches theoretical predictions to within 8. 41 %. The oblique shock begins at a distance of 1. 5 inches downstream of nozzle exit when the AAR is operating in the Fabri choked condition. The images also show the mixing region which forms between the primary and secondary flows. The mixing region represents as much as 25 % of the cross-sectional area of the flow field in the mixing duct two inches downstream of the nozzle exit. An analysis of the secondary Mach number in the mixing duct shows that Fabri choking is occurring during testing. The secondary Mach number decreases as pressure ratio increases, in the Fabri choked condition. The transition to Fabri choking occurs at a pressure ratio of 100, suggesting that this is the pressure ratio of the saturated case. The shape of the primary plume was compared to results from a 2 -D simulation developed to predict the flow field inside the Cal Poly AAR. Although, the simulation is unable to predict the entire flowfield, modifications made it able to predict the velocity of the secondary, entrained, flow within 3. 7 %. The modified simulation also predicts the that the primary plume will have expanded 98 % of its total distance from the centerline of the mixing duct 1. 7 inches downstream of the primary nozzle exit. Pressure data taken along the wall of the mixing duct was used to identify the location of Fabri choking in the mixing duct. Tests showed that Fabri choking is occurring between 1 inch and 2. 5 inches downstream of the nozzle exit. The location of Fabri choking moves farther downstream of the nozzle as pressure ratio increases...|$|E

A normal Bussard ramjet would have an infinite supply of both, however theory suggests that where a Bussard ramjet would suffer drag from the fact that the interstellar gas ahead of it would have to be accelerated to its speed before entering the fusion reactor, whereas a RAIR system would be able to transfer energy via the [...] "accelerator" [...] mechanism from the reactor to the interstellar gas without having to accelerate the gas up to the ship's speed before putting this gas through the [...] "accelerator", and so would suffer far less drag.|$|R
