500|$|On {{the story}} side, reviewers agreed the {{professional}} actors, such as Ian Ziering, did <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> bringing their respective characters to life. [...] However, criticism {{was placed on}} the lone voice who voiced all the generic male encounters for his monotonous delivery and making all his characters sound alike. [...] The long cutscenes, which cannot be skipped, frustrated game journalist Tom Chick; he wanted to skip the scenes and continue playing instead of being forced to watch a clichéd story. [...] Other reviewers expressed their own frustrations with the story, such as being forced to move to another star system at undesired times, or leaving them without an objective after the campaign abruptly ended.|$|E
500|$|Aitraaz {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, who praised its direction, music and performances, particularly Chopra's. It was {{noted for its}} bold subject of sexual harassment. Several critics observed that the premise {{was similar to the}} American film Disclosure (1994). Writing for the BBC, critic Jay Mamtora praised the film's theme, music and performances, and remarked that [...] "Abbas-Mustaan have done <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> 'Indianising' the whole concept". He went on to describe it as [...] "a gripping edge of the seat drama that keeps viewers glued to their seats". Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama rated the film 3.5 out of 5, calling it [...] "a well-crafted thriller" [...] and complimenting the directors' opting for [...] "a theme that has been untouched on the Indian screen so far" [...] and the film's [...] "dramatic moments".|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally, {{a utility}} player is an unheralded but {{nonetheless}} important player.

2500|$|After the Ward Churchill controversy, a {{telephone}} survey of “a thousand Americans aged 18 and older” by the American Association of University Professors found that, while “generally {{supportive of the}} tenure system”, [...] "only about 17.9 percent of respondents say the tenure system should remain as it is". Another poll found that 65% believed that [...] "non-tenured professors are more motivated to do <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> the classroom".|$|E
2500|$|In 1947, Rother {{established}} her {{own design}} {{studio in the}} Fisher Building, where she specialized in designs for automotive interiors, furniture, and stained glass windows. Her business was named Helene Rother Associates. In 1948 she published a technical paper with the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) asking [...] "Are we doing <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> our car interiors" [...] She participated in SAE conferences describing that much can be and {{should be done in}} improving automobile interior design and the materials used at that time, summarizing what determines quality in textiles [...] "You get exactly what you pay for." ...|$|E
40|$|As idealistic {{as it may}} sound, {{the truth}} is that NGOs act {{to make the world a}} better place. They often do that by taking action in areas where the {{government}} fails to succeed or does not do <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>job.</b> <b>In</b> this context I would like to present a very special NGO: CIVITAS Foundation for Civil Society, evaluating its governance and services. </p...|$|R

The wolves are one of two antagonists on the show.|$|R
50|$|The mascot of Tartu Toy Museum is Teddy Flower-paw, who was sewn in 1994 by Kai Maser. The {{name of the}} teddy in the {{national}} folk costume skirt comes from the flower-patterned cloth {{that was used to}} sew its paws. Teddy Flower-paw has done <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> representing the museum: there are books written about her, postcards drawn, she has appeared on television and at events.|$|R
2500|$|She also {{remarked that}} [...] "combining {{non-human}} qualities with an attractive human appearance," [...] as in Seven's character, {{was a great}} move by the producers. She felt that the writers did <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> not pushing the character to be more human and having Seven enter into relationships on the show, Ryan was concerned {{that it could have}} turned out to be [...] "Seven's sexual escapades on Voyager". In terms of portrayal, she said that [...] "keeping a straight face" [...] while showing suppressed emotion was an enjoyable challenge. Regarding her form-fitting one-piece costume, Ryan commented that it was extremely impractical and uncomfortable, but worth the reward of portraying a character like Seven.|$|E
2500|$|..... the {{provision}} of job satisfaction, a sense of identity, self-worth, emotional well-being and dignity ... may indeed be amongst the consequences of having <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> a company run by good management, something to which every employee would aspire. However, emotions such as senses of identity, self-worth and dignity are felt in the breast of the employee, are highly subjective and would, necessarily, be felt to differing extents by different employees within the same working environment. I {{do not believe that}} the common law has come close to making the employer responsible for emotions of this kind, or to giving legal consequences to the fact that they are not generated in a particular situation.|$|E

40|$|To conclude, Dyson {{had clearly}} {{developed}} the research themes {{based on what}} she observed from the children’s literacy learning experiences to show how their worldviews were developed through their meaning-making negotiations and constructions with people around them. She was very deliberate and detailed in explaining the literacy world of children. She had done <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> associating children’s literate behaviors with Bakhtin’s concept of language as social dialogues Geertz’s concept of “imaginative universe”...|$|R

Certainly Jeff Saxton's painless worship did not turn him into the {{likeness}} of a knight among banners. Yet the good Geoffrey loved her, while to Milt Daggett she could {{be nothing more than}} a strange young woman in a car with a New York license. If her tiny gift could so please him, how poor he must be.

60|$|Well, that's that. What I {{am really}} writing about {{is to tell}} you that you have got to come over here. I've taken a house at Brookport, on Long Island, for the summer.

The {{managers}} have only got to see you and they'll all want you. I showed one of them that photograph you gave me, and he went up in the air. They pay twice as big salaries over here, you know, as in England, so come by the next boat.|$|E

Using Bayesian methods {{we find that}} the model does <b>a</b> fairly <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> replicating the data. Surprisingly, we find a large value for the worker’s bargaining power and low vacancy posting costs. The model generates a strong Beveridge curve and matches the standard deviations of all variables but vacancies. We identify technology and separation shocks to be the main driver of fluctuations. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{education}} system and larger political economy it serves influence why mothers {{become obsessed with}} children's education. Social prejudices influence media stereotypes of kyōiku mamas that blame women rather than political conditions. Getting <b>a</b> <b>good,</b> steady <b>job</b> <b>in</b> the future very much depends on getting into <b>a</b> <b>good</b> university, which depends on attaining high scores on the national university exams in a student's last year of high school. Ordinary people, including mothers, feel powerless to change this system.|$|R

The books in this series focus upon selected areas of archaeology, including method and theory. Quilter states the truism that "archaeologists have not done <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> discussing {{the history of their}} own discipline" (p. vi).
