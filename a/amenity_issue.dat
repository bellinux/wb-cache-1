40|$|This update briefly reviews {{some of the}} {{principles}} of sustainability which require the attention of applicants and approval authorities, especially relevant in the consideration of development applications for multi-residential construction. In New South Wales, Australia, this issue is dealt with almost exclusively under the SEPP BASIX regulations. The paper comments briefly on some trends under BASIX, withsome prognosis for the future. Within the broader framework of sustainability concerns, the two amenity requirements of solar access and natural ventilation have become increasingly influential determinants of the architectural design of apartments. Because they are often poorly understood, both have tended to be interpreted rather mechanically both by designers and Council officers. This paper highlights some experiences when one approaches these <b>amenity</b> <b>issues</b> with greater technical sophistication...|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} employees´ <b>amenities</b> <b>issue.</b> Employees´ <b>amenities</b> {{belong to the}} inseparable instruments of contemporary management of human capital. Employees´ amenities affect positively employees´ contentment. Furthermore, they restrain fluctuation, encourage loyalty and motivate to higher and better performances. The goal of this thesis was to characterize employees´ amenities, their historical evolution and main meaning. The thesis was also focused on survey of the most known employees´ amenities and their tax perspective from the employees´ and employers´ points of view. The practical part was focused on analysis of employees´ amenities which are provided in labour-law relations. A conducted survey showed how employees perceive their amenities, if they use them, are satisfied with them or if they prefer other amenities. The survey was realised in the JIP { [...] } Papírny Větřní, a. s. company and other companies of the Czech South territory as well so that the comparison of the survey was enabled...|$|R
40|$|Overbank flow in a {{meandering}} channel displays a complex coherent flow structure {{resulting from the}} interplay between the floodplain and main channel flows. Understanding and modeling such coherent flow structure are of great importance for addressing river engineering and management issues where the design solutions are required to retain natural channel features and to maintain a balance between environmental, ecological and <b>amenity</b> <b>issues.</b> In recent years, numerical models have increasingly been used for river flow modeling {{in order to understand}} their flow behavior. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} predict and investigate the overbank flow behavior in the physical model of {{meandering channel}}s using three-dimensional (3 D) numerical model. The performance of the model is first assessed by comparing predicted results with the limited experimental data. The experiment data were obtained from a 1 : 5 scale physical model of the River Blackwater and a flume study in Loughborough University. The predicted distributions of the streamwise velocity, secondary vectors, turbulent parameters and bed shear stress are used to investigate the coherent flow structures along the channel, in both the horizontal and inclined floodplain cases and main channel mobile sand bed case. The results show that the three-dimensional model predicts the coherent flow structures reasonably well. ...|$|R
40|$|This article deals {{with the}} {{definition}} of amenity and more specifi- cally with cultural <b>amenity</b> <b>issues.</b> The very concept of amenity still remains unclear though it has been widely used both in the environmental field since the 70 ’s, and in the cultural one {{since the beginning of}} the twentieth century. In the latter stream of literature, it is used to discuss urban development based on culture and creative class theory. However, the concept is often reduced to the amount of cultural equipment available in a city. We define an amenity as a non-market service provided by the specific features pertaining to an area. In addition, the amenity is a non-excludable and non-rivalrous service within this area. The originality of this paper lies in the analysis of the conditions under which cultural amenities can be generated and strengthened at a city scale. The process of cultural amenity generation depends on three main features concerning cultural assets: their density, their anchorage in the city and the implementation of flagship assets. Cultural activities can be instrumental in shaping charm, image and ambiance of cities. The last three items are examples of amenities. The randomness, the complexity and the bottom-up aspect of the amenity generation phenomenon is also discussed. Side issues that are at stake such as city gentrification, strategies of access to amenities are also part of our reflection. ...|$|R

40|$|On a quiet Sunday {{afternoon}} in January 2015, a 12 year old girl was assaulted in Geelong’s Market Square mall. The attack sparked a media furore over {{what should be}} done to address the ongoing safety and <b>amenity</b> <b>issues</b> of this intractable public space. The city’s mayor, Cr Darryn Lyons, responded to the situation by declaring the mall a ‘haunt for bogans and scumbags’ and renewed calls for its demolition. Such rhetoric highlights the exclusionary mindset that casts certain types of people as undesirable inhabitants of public spaces. It also bolsters negative public perceptions of the mall. Once formed, such attitudes are difficult to shift, despite an overall improvement in the area’s crime rates over recent years. Poor perceptions are further reinforced by the soulless nature of the mall’s built fabric and weak urban interfaces. Its formal language is one of hostility, not only towards would-be delinquents, but to all people. The space is furnished with cold stainless steel seats, CCTV cameras and limp, pavement water spouts, while its inactive edges consist of loading bays, security grilles and neglected facades. This paper considers how a more inclusive architecture might be utilised to create a kinder, more generous physical environment that reflects the public nature of the space. While not a quick fix, fostering an architecture that encourages a more equitable use of the mall may diminish the sense of fear, anxiety and suspicion that the space currently elicits, tackling the problem at both a structural and social level...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the urban {{form of a}} city, planners must engage with complex questions of density, land use distribution, and accessibility to services and <b>amenities.</b> These <b>issues,</b> in turn, relate to critical strategic planning goals, such as regional equity, attractiveness, and environmental sustainability. In our research, conducted {{on behalf of the}} Nordic Working Group for Green Growth - sustainable urban regions, we tested a new methodological approach for integrating and measuring several of these dimensions. In doing so, we provided a spatial analysis of population density, service accessibility, and commuting pattern metrics of four case study areas in the Nordic Region: Funen (DK),Stockholm (SE), Tampere (FI) and Trondheim (NO). This analysis was applied with the following general principle in mind: where many types of services, public transportation and other amenities that people take benefit from in their everyday life are available within a convenient time distance, we can talk of well-functioning nodes in the urban form of a city. By considering this principle in relation to the urban patterns that are mapped, we aimed to determine how our analytical approach can be relevant for strategic planners working at the municipal or regional level. ...|$|R
40|$|Contingent {{valuation}} {{surveys have}} become an important tool in placing monetary values on non-market goods and <b>amenities.</b> Many policy <b>issues</b> involve evaluation of several alternatives such as different environmental quality levels, different levels of risk, etc. Contingent valuation then involves asking the respondent a sequence of nested questions. Asking and analyzing a nested sequence of questions is an efficient approach to data gathering and preference revelation. The resultant sequentially censored data set cannot be efficiently analyzed with the standard regression models like the Tobit or nested logit models. The nested Tobit model is proposed as an efficient and consistent method of estimating regressions using sequentially censored data. An empirical application suggests greater efficiency {{in comparison to the}} Heckman two-stage procedure. Copyright 1994 by MIT Press. ...|$|R
40|$|Metropolitan {{agriculture}} is economically important, {{especially in the}} Northeast. Wh]le faced with substantial economic and regulatory obstacles, commercial farming in urban areas is surviving and even prospering. In terms of standard models of agriculture in economic development, this is a puzzle. But more detailed, spatial economic models indicate how labor-intensive production of perishable commodities in urbanized areas can make economic sense, especially when coupled with environmental amenities that farming generates for nonfarm people. At the same time, environmental disamenities of agriculture are larger in densely populated areas. The political economy outcomes {{have tended to be}} favorable to continued farming, albeit with increased regulation. Nonetheless, many questions remain about the dynamics of agricultural adjustment to urbanization, and the possible steady-state mix of farm and nonfarm activities. Agriculture in an urbanized area faces both prob-lems and opportunities that are specific to such locations, and which have been somewhat ne-glected in the main stream of work by agricultural economists. The most salient current issues in-volve policy and regulation, generated by the more intense interaction between farm and nonfarm ac-tivities that results from close proximity of farm and nonfarm people, and from increased competi-tion for natural resources such as water, air qual-ity, and environmental <b>amenities.</b> The <b>issues</b> confront more than a small minority of farmers, especially in the Northeast. About 30 percent of U. S. farms (by the U. S. Census farm definition) are located in metropolitan statistical areas, and in the Northeast (New England, Ne...|$|R
40|$|Evidence is {{emerging}} linking environmental noise to health problems. Noise can affect health directly and indirectly: For example, noise sensitivity moderates {{the effects of}} noise annoyance, which in turn mediates the effects of noise exposure. An alternative hypothesis is that noise sensitivity marks the presence of susceptibility to health problems in general, including annoyance from noise. Whether noise sensitivity causes poor health {{or whether it is}} a marker of susceptibility to health problems was addressed by comparing the results of a community-based survey of people with similar noise sensitivity profiles but different environmental noise exposures. A questionnaire was delivered to people living in two socio-economically-matched areas: One was within 50 m of a motorway and the other was away from any significant source of environmental noise. The questionnaire contained 58 questions comprised of the World Health Organization health-related quality of life questionnaire (WHOQOL), and questions about <b>amenity,</b> neighborhood <b>issues,</b> environmental annoyances, demographics, and noise sensitivity. Noise sensitivity did not vary with proximity to the motorway but annoyance with traffic noise and fumes was greater in those living close to the motorway than in those who were not. Scores on the four WHOQOL domains (physical, psychological, social, and environmental) were lower in those living close to the motorway, and the WHOQOL domain scores correlated negatively with noise sensitivity in those who lived near motorways but not in those who lived in the quieter areas. This suggests that noise sensitivity is related to poor health outcomes rather than being a trait marker of susceptibility to health problems in general...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{consolidation}} involving increasing densification around existing nodes {{of urban}} infrastructure {{is a strategy}} pursued by {{all levels of government}} for addressing rapid population growth in urban regions. This has both positive and negative impacts on the everyday lives of residents (or their urban liveability as perceived by them), even though urban consolidation is commonly resisted by residents. This paper aims to better understand impacts of urban consolidation on liveability by comparing similarities and differences in impacts between two Brisbane suburbs: an outer fringe suburb (Wynnum) and an inner city suburb (West End). Wynnum residents generally expressed less resistance to urban consolidation, with some residents willing to trade additional densification for additional <b>amenities.</b> Two <b>issues</b> concerning residents in both suburbs were aesthetics of high-rise development and traffic congestion. Building heights more than a few storeys above surrounding buildings were commonly seen as detracting from urban liveability, though buildings up to 30 stories were accepted by some if close to the Commercial Business District. Traffic congestion was seen as a problem in both suburbs reflecting widespread car dependency. Other impacts differed between suburbs, reflecting their different values and ways of living. For example, most West End residents were concerned about losing social diversity with declining housing affordability while many Wynnum residents were concerned about gaining more public or social housing and disadvantaged residents. The impacts of urban consolidation on liveability differ between suburbs, and local neighbourhood plans should be sensitive to local notions of urban liveability because residents often stay after urban consolidation, even if they perceive negative impacts on their liveability. These interviews reinforce liveability as primary focus for urban planning, and thus urban consolidation at the expense of liveability is a poor outcome for both local residents and urban planning...|$|R
40|$|With {{the global}} water crisis as catalyst, Water+Works {{acts as a}} model for a {{localized}} water initiative that will mitigate flooding and provide a freshwater resource in times of crisis, while enriching urban ecosystems and creating a vibrant recreational amenity for a new civic public. The new typology creates a gradual transition from land to water to contend with sea level rise and increased storm surge flooding. During calm weather conditions, the graduated edge of tidal estuaries will enrich the bay ecology, while creating a sustainable and resilient ecosystem that works to remediate the polluted harbor water. Urbanistically, this will open up the waterfront for recreational facilities including indoor and outdoor public pools, public boat docks and a new water taxi pier providing increased access to the area. This model becomes a new precedent for building civic <b>amenities,</b> where multiple <b>issues</b> are conflated to generate a richer, more dynamic urban condition. by Lisa Kristin Hedstrom.

40|$|Amenity {{values on}} urban {{arterial}} roads are fraught. This is {{largely due to}} the traditional traffic capacity versus amenity trade-off. This trade-off implies that high-capacity roads must be inherently deficient in <b>amenity</b> due to <b>issues</b> of air quality, noise nuisance and the physical barrier of streams of traffic. However, a more nuanced position – and one adopted by this thesis - is that arterial roads can be both busy thoroughfares and active, enjoyable destinations. This design-led research explores retrofitting amenity values onto existing arterial roads, creating new spaces and improving qualities of a system not originally constructed with amenity in mind. Cuba Street in Lower Hutt is a regionally significant connector intended for future densified development. In addition to the current link function, this road needs to become more attractive as a destination and address. Consideration at the urban scale encourages broad, strategic planning to support amenity holistically. This urban planning addresses topics like desirable densification, transit-oriented development, walkable centres and how these affect the arterial road condition. In moving from urban-scaled to architectural design, the detailed implementation of the greater policies is tested. Architecture is engaged to respond to the immediate arterial road conditions with spaces and surfaces, protective buffers and layers. In this way - with architectural refinement and a comprehensive, coherent strategy - traffic capacity and amenity can be brought into balance...|$|R

40|$|Sustainability is a {{relatively}} new field simultaneously addressing economic health, environmental <b>amenities,</b> and social <b>issues.</b> Sustainable Community Assessment and Planning (SUS 350) is a new course in the Sustainable Community Development major, minor, and undergraduate certificate at Stephen F. Austin State University. It is designed to introduce students to: a) varied methods of data collection; b) complex community planning issues; c) synthesis of economic, environmental, and social issues. Distance (online) education is not typically associated with field-based learning. However, field work in sustainability can be encouraged through activities such as: monitoring energy/cost saving; measuring biological status; and citizen social surveys. Student online journal notes/discussions related to these field exercises were assessed using a rubric for evaluation of information, creative thinking, problem solving, and communication of content. The rubric has a scale of 1 - 4 (4 is highest). Most all scores were 2 or 3, with an overall average of 2. 3. Higher scores (averaging 2. 5 and 2. 7) were found in field activities that most synthesized economy and environment on campus, such as a campus energy monitoring workshop, a campus food waste audit, and discussions centered around a future campus green fund. Despite moderate scores, students did show capability for higher-order thinking, especially in synthesizing economy and environment on campus.

40|$|Recent work {{on health}} and place has {{examined}} {{the impact of the}} environment on health. At the local level, research has followed several strands, such as contextual effects of neighborhoods, the impact of differential access to services and amenities, effects of a neighborhood's collective efficacy, and the relationship between social capital and health. Of these four approaches, social capital has generated the most debate; some scholars discuss social capital as a key epidemiological variable, while others discount or dismiss its utility. We undertook this research to assess whether the concept of social capital could increase our understanding of the impact of neighborhoods on residents' health. We utilized key informant interviews and focus groups to understand ways in which residents of diverse neighborhoods in one large California city perceived that their local communities were affecting health. We argue in this paper that using the term "social capital" to discuss social resources and their mobilization in a particular neighborhood highlights the ways in which social resources can vary in relation to economic resources, and that residents of neighborhoods with differing levels of services and <b>amenities</b> face different <b>issues</b> when mobilizing to improve their neighborhoods. Additionally, the projects that people invest in vary by neighborhood socioeconomic status. We draw on the paired concepts of "bridging" and "bonding" social capital, and discuss that while stores of bonding social capital may be more uniform across neighborhoods of varying SES, bridging social capital tends to be found in greater amounts in neighborhoods of higher SES which allows them greater success when mobilizing to improve their neighborhoods.

50|$|Transition from {{a secluded}} {{area on the}} city’s {{outskirts}} having only graveyards and grape wines to a partially developed, semi urban residential area. This is what Konanakunte has witnessed {{over the last two}} decades. Konanakunte, as the name goes likely means “Buffaloe pond”. As we enter the area, Harijan colony in Konanakunte a small area occupied by slum dwellers had a natural pond, which was put into use as a source of drinking water for buffalos. The vast portion of Konanakunte was filled with cultivation of crops such as avarekai, huchellu & Ragi to name a few. It gained popularity during the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in early 90’s. The main accused Shivarasan along with his aides was found to be hiding here. The only landmark in the area was the huge Khodays factory, employing local people. Over the years, Konanakunte has experienced a great deal of development in terms of population infrastructure and urbanization. But urbanization has brought along with it the evils such as improper civic <b>amenities</b> and security <b>issues.</b> The area has as come under the influence of cosmopolitan life but with out forgoing the characters of a typical Indian village. The city of Bangalore is attracting immigration {{from all parts of the}} country. Konanakunte once known as the sleeping village on the city’s outskirts known only for farming and underemployment is today a sprawling locality with people of various origins making it their home. The main attraction in this colony and the crux of the issue is the booming real estate opportunities. Thousands of hectares of land in and around Konanakunte has been converted into residential layouts and the value of land had gone up in geometrical proportions. In spite of the area attracting inhabitants and business, civic amenities are as low as it could be infrastructure like stable roads; drainage, streetlights, security and medical facilities are not in place.Soon with the completion of the ambitious Namma Metro project, Konanakunte will become much more easily accessible and hence it is foreseen that a further surge in the population of this area will occur.|$|R
40|$|The {{severity}} of the January 2003 Canberra bushfires initiated a national enquiry on bushfire mitigation and management by the Council of Australian Governments. One of the core messages conveyed by the enquiry was a concern about community complacency, particularly in the rural-urban interface, that previous and subsequent enquiries and research have also expressed. The enquiry also highlighted the importance of retaining local environmental knowledge on bushfire considering the demographic changes associated with <b>amenity</b> migration. These <b>issues</b> form {{the core of this}} thesis. This thesis examines how experiences of place, culture, events and context mediate how diverse types of landholders in changing rural landscapes in southeast Australia relate to bushfire risk. It builds on a growing international concern about the increasing number of people living in rural-urban interface areas in light of the increased frequency of tragic bushfires, and the predicted increase iii high fire danger weather with climate change. It focuses on the dynamics of local environmental knowledge and bushfire management in changing rural landscapes by investigating: i) how amenity migration is influencing awareness, preparedness and attitudes to bushfire; and ii) how amenity migration is influencing and challenging the interpretation and uptake of bushfire risk communication. A mixed-methods research approach, involving postal surveys and in-depth interactive interviews, was used to explore the significant factors that influence if, how and to what extent landholders 2 ̆ 7 prepare for bushfires. The qualitative data particularly provided insights into how landholders gain knowledge on bushfire issues, and the actual characteristics of local environmental knowledge present within changing rural landscapes. The thesis develops a nuanced, complex and critical understanding of landholders 2 ̆ 7 engagement with bushfire risk in changing rural landscapes. It demonstrates how attitudes, awareness, and actions towards bushfire management are tied to a range of emotions and experiences that are deeply embedded in traditions as well as dilemmas in everyday life. While acknowledging the importance of the scientific discourses that underpin official bushfire management policy and practice, the thesis reveals that official rationality often does not translate well into landholders 2 ̆ 7 everyday life. Instead local knowledge, lifestyles, gender roles, learning styles, and conflicting priorities, all mediate how landholders 2 ̆ 7 relate to living with fire on the land. It is these complex frames of reference in everyday life that determine if, how, and to what extent landholders prepare for bushfire, rather than landholders 2 ̆ 7 risk awareness. The thesis concludes with one core recommendation: the need to include meaningful engagement in future bushfire risk communication, education, and management programmes in the form of local, context specific, and interactive initiatives. This recommendation is all the more pertinent given the findings of the 2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission into the 2 ̆ 2 Black Saturday 2 ̆ 2 bushfires. It is a tragic irony that Australia is licking its 2 ̆ 7 burn wounds once again as this PhD project comes to a close...|$|R
