40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of Artemisia argyi aqueous extract (AAE) on antioxidant indexes in the small intestine. A total of 192 Arbor Acre broiler chickens (one-day-old) were randomly divided into 4 treatments with 6 replicates of 8 chickens. These 4 diets were formulated by adding 0, 500, 1, 000 and 2, 000  mg/kg AAE to the basal diet. The results showed as follows: 1) compared with the control, the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in ileum for the 2, 000  mg/kg treatment group was significantly increased at 21 days of age (P <  0. 05); the T-AOC levels in jejunum and ileum were significantly increased in broilers supplemented with 500  mg/kg AAE at 42 days of age (P <  0. 05), and the T-AOC levels in jejunum and ileum were significantly improved in 1, 000  mg/kg treatment group (P <  0. 01). 2) At 21 days of age, supplementation of 500  mg/kg AAE significantly increased the catalase (CAT) <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> small intestine, and the glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> jejunum was improved (P <  0. 01), meanwhile, the GSH-Px <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> duodenum and the total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> duodenum and jejunum were significantly higher than those of the control group (P <  0. 05); supplementation of 1, 000  mg/kg AAE significantly increased the CAT <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> duodenum and ileum and the GSH-Px <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> duodenum and jejunum (P <  0. 05), and the ileum GSH-Px activity was significantly increased (P <  0. 01); supplementation of 2, 000  mg/kg AAE significantly increased the CAT <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> duodenum and ileum (P <  0. 05). At 42 days of age, supplementation of 500  mg/kg AAE significantly increased the GSH-Px <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> ileum and the T-SOD <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> duodenum (P <  0. 05), meanwhile, the T-SOD <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> jejunum was significantly increased (P <  0. 01); supplementation of 1, 000  mg/kg AAE significantly increased the CAT <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> jejunum and the T-SOD <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> ileum (P <  0. 01), and the GSH-Px <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> jejunum was significantly increased (P <  0. 05); supplementation of 2, 000  mg/kg AAE significantly increased the T-SOD <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> ileum (P <  0. 05), but significantly decreased the CAT <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> ileum and the GSH-Px <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> jejunum (P <  0. 05). 3) The malondialdehyde (MDA) levels of 3 AAE supplementation groups were significantly decreased at 21 and 42 days of age (P <  0. 05).
