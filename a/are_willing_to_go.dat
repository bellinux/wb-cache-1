25|$|Depending {{on whether}} selling or buying, sellers or buyers use a ridiculously high, or ridiculously low opening offer {{that is not}} achievable. The {{theory is that the}} extreme offer makes the other party reevaluate their own opening offer and move close to the {{resistance}} point (as far as you <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to reach an agreement). Another advantage is that the party giving the extreme demand appears more flexible when they make concessions toward a more reasonable outcome. A danger of this tactic is that the opposite party may think negotiating is a waste of time.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{uncertainties}} {{in the text}} comes in the word , which indicates that the seaweed has a hold on the castaway. Some scholars prefer to read , indicating that he spews out seaweed. Scholars often contrast the poem's realism with the artificiality of Horace's Epode 10, but not all scholars <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> along with this view, citing the Homeric diction as a literary device {{and the absence of}} proof that the oath-breaker was ever a real man rather than just a scapegoat or imaginary exemplar. Yet the poet has made the context seem real.|$|E
500|$|The Immaculate Collection, Madonna's first greatest-hits {{compilation}} album, {{was released}} in November 1990. It included two new songs, [...] "Justify My Love" [...] and [...] "Rescue Me". The album was certified diamond by RIAA and sold over 30 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling compilation album by a solo artist in history. [...] "Justify My Love" [...] reached {{number one in the}} U.S. becoming her ninth number-one Its music video featured scenes of sadomasochism, bondage, same-sex kissing, and brief nudity. The video was deemed too sexually explicit for MTV and was banned from the network. Madonna responded to the banning: [...] "Why is it that people <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and watch a movie about someone getting blown to bits for no reason at all, and nobody wants to see two girls kissing and two men snuggling?" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} also {{intended to}} tease {{the audience that}} after the brutal killing of Ben Kaplan (Alex Lanipekun) from the previous episode, they would think that things could not get worse for the team, until the nuclear threat in the finale. The scene where the team breaks Connie out was intended to show the audience that the protagonists <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to extreme measures to stop serious threats. Cross {{wanted to make it}} a very pure Spooks episode by setting up the entire plot in one scene, and then include a chase throughout London between FSB officers and the main characters. Cross enjoyed creating the FSB team featured in the episode, especially as he created them as a Russian version of the Spooks protagonists, but also make their base much more lit with windows. The bomb defusal scene was originally set at a graveyard, but the producers decided {{it would be best to}} set it underground. Though it took several rewrites, the script remained [...] "fundamentally the same" [...] throughout the writing process.|$|E
500|$|The 167 Bikini islanders {{first learned}} their fate four days later, on Sunday, February 10, when Navy Commodore Ben H. Wyatt, United States {{military}} {{governor of the}} Marshall Islands, arrived by seaplane from Kwajalein. Referring to Biblical stories which they had learned from Protestant missionaries, he compared them to [...] "the children of Israel whom the Lord saved from their enemy and led into the Promised Land." [...] He also claimed it was [...] "for the good of mankind and to end all world wars." [...] There was no signed agreement, but he reported by cable [...] "their local chieftain, referred to as King Juda, arose {{and said that the}} natives of Bikini were very proud {{to be part of this}} wonderful undertaking." [...] On March 6, Wyatt attempted to stage a filmed reenactment of the February 10 meeting in which the Bikinians had given away their atoll. Despite repeated promptings and at least seven retakes, Juda confined his on-camera remarks to, [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> Everything is in God's hands." [...] The next day, LST-861 moved them and their belongings [...] east to the uninhabited Rongerik Atoll, to begin a permanent exile. Three Bikini families returned in 1974 but were evacuated again in 1978 because of radioactivity in their bodies from four years of eating contaminated food. As of 2015, the atoll remains unpopulated.|$|E

50|$|The mesolimbic pathway is {{involved}} in motivation cognition. Depletion of dopamine in this pathway, or lesions at its site of origin, decrease {{the extent to which}} an animal <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> obtain a reward (e.g., the number of lever presses for nicotine or time searching for food). Dopaminergic drugs are also able to increase the extent an animal <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> get a reward, and the firing rate of neurons in the mesolimbic pathway increases during anticipation of reward. Mesolimbic dopamine release was once thought to be the primary mediator of pleasure, but is now believed to have only a minor role in pleasure perception.|$|R

2500|$|Chechen militants {{interviewed by}} the Financial Times and Vice News said that they became {{involved}} in the conflict on the orders of the Chechen president. President Kadyrov strongly denied these reports on 1 June. In his statement, he said that there were [...] "74,000 Chechens who <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to bring order to the territory of Ukraine", and that he would not send them to Donetsk, but to Kiev. As of May 2015, majority of previously pro-Russian Chechen paramilitaries exited the conflict, because of the two known incidents with Zakharchenko and his people, according to Akhmed Zakayev.|$|E
2500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN rated it 6 out of 10 in his review: [...] "It {{crossed a}} line, {{but not one}} of gore. Or death, even. Not necessarily. It {{basically}} broke the final shred of trust in the show to service characters over gimmickry." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C-, the lowest grade given by the website to the show thus far: [...] "The show is so stupid that it thinks we're stupid, prays we're stupid; cross its fingers and hopes like hell that its legion of loyal, obsessive followers will rend their garments at the horrible death of a fan favorite, but still be back next week." [...] According to Stuart Jeffries of The Guardian, [...] "This was, to put it mildly, uncomfortable viewing: 45-plus minutes of torture porn mingled with something even more unpalatable ... this wasn't so much entertainment as psychic evisceration for us." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Vox wrote, [...] "I've {{had a lot of}} issues with The Walking Dead of late — especially with that genuinely terrible season six finale — but I probably still would have called myself, in general, a “fan” of the show until tonight". Brian Lowry from CNN also criticized the episode: [...] "Nevertheless, its most admirable qualities have increasingly been overshadowed by its more distasteful ones -- not merely in demonstrating just how brutal humanity can be, but by toying with its audience." [...] Jeff Stone of IndieWire wrote in his review, [...] "It was miserable, and tedious, and made me feel bad. Not in an emotionally compelling way, just in a 'I could be watching something of value' way", and he graded the episode D-. Kristi Turnquist of The Oregonian was also critical: [...] "The most shocking reveal was just how low executive producer and showrunner Scott M. Gimple and [...] "Walking Dead" [...] comics creator Robert Kirkman <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> for the sake of sensationalism and torture porn." ...|$|E
