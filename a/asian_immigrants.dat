5|$|In Europe and the Americas, a {{relatively}} small number of DPB cases have been reported in <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrants</b> and residents, as well as in individuals of non-Asian ancestry. Misdiagnosis has occurred in the West owing to less recognition of the disease than in Asian countries. Relative to the large number of Asians living in the west, the small number of them thought to be affected by DPB suggests non-genetic factors may play some role in its cause. This rarity seen in Western Asians may also be partly associated with misdiagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Tea is {{the second}} most {{consumed}} beverage in the world, after water. Argo was founded in response to a realization that Americans had so few tea offerings that they generally were unfamiliar with anything but bagged teas. At the time, most tea retailers either supplied bulk tea for home brewing or traditional sit-down service, but Argo focused on premium specialty drinks in paper cups. Meanwhile, a minority of <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrants</b> from countries such as India, Vietnam and China where tea is the national beverage were spreading some of their traditions. Argo endeavored to emphasize the healthy aspects of tea as an alternative to coffee. When it was founded, Argo was part of a field of blossoming tea cafe franchises meeting a burgeoning demand. By 2002, there were 1,100 tearooms with sit-down service. In 2003, retail sales of tea totaled $5.1billion, and in 2005, as the specialty tea market was growing 20percent per year, the total retail tea market was expected to surpass $10 billion by 2010.|$|E
40|$|During acculturation, <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> {{adolescents}} have numerous challenges such as language barriers, {{cultural and}} ethnic differences, different school environments, discrimination experiences, and intergroup conflicts and tension. These challenges generate acculturative stress, which negatively affects {{the perception of}} health and well-being among <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> adolescents. This article explored how <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> adolescents perceive and cope with acculturative stress. In particular, {{this study examined the}} stress-coping strategies in the adaptation process as experienced by Korean immigrant adolescents. Three main themes associated with the stress-coping strategies were captured: (a) engagement in meaningful activities; (b) social support; and (c) positive emotion. This finding implies that <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> adolescents create and develop their own strategies to deal with acculturative stress, which results in a sense of happiness and psychological well-being. This study discuss the future implications on how to improve the perception of health and well-being among <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> adolescents...|$|R
40|$|This counseling-practice {{oriented}} paper examines clinical {{challenges that}} therapists face {{in working with}} <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> women and their families. Salient Asian cultural factors are discussed to help non-Asian therapists {{gain a better understanding}} of their Asian clients in a therapeutic relationship. A clinical case vignette is incorporated in the paper to illustrate how cultural factors influence <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> women and their families in therapy. A case-study method was employed in this present study as a method of data collection. The results reflect that cultural competence is greatly needed when working with <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> women and their families, taking into consideration the systemic nature of this population’s ways handling both individual and familial struggles with mental health issues. Lastly, the paper offers therapists/clinicians culturally sensitive therapeutic assessment and intervention strategies that are deemed effective in working with <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> women and their families struggling with mental health issues...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} on immigrant integration {{has tended to}} focus on economic and social integration. As such, the factors shaping health integration are less understood. At the same time, health researchers suggest that immigrants in Canada may underutilize certain health services. For instance, studies have documented the low participation rates of cervical cancer screening among <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> women in Canada (Xiong, Murphy, Matthews, Gadag, 2 ̆ 6 Wang, 2010; McDonald 2 ̆ 6 Kennedy, 2007; Woltman 2 ̆ 6 Newbold, 2007). This study sheds light on immigrant integration by exploring the experiences of <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> women with cervical cancer screening and Canadian healthcare services more broadly. Through in-depth interviews, <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> women share their experiences in the healthcare system. They report many difficulties including language, relationships with healthcare providers, cultural perspectives toward health, adjustment to a new healthcare system, and access to information.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{quantitative}} {{study was to examine}} the impact of acculturation, neighborhood cohesion, gender, and marital status on the mental health of <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> adults. Methods: A sample population of <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> adults was extracted (n= 708) from the California Health and Interview Survey (CHIS) 2011 - 2012 data. Descriptive and parametric inferential statistics were used for data analysis. Results: The results of the study indicated that higher levels of acculturation were related to better mental health outcomes. Neighborhood cohesion was found to have very little impact on mental health. <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> females were found to have higher levels of mental health problems than males. Additionally, married individuals were found to have better mental health than unmarried individuals.

40|$|This study explores why South <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> {{women with}} {{experiences}} of partner abuse delay seeking help from professionals. Three focus groups {{were conducted in}} Hindi language with South <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> women in Toronto. Twenty-two women participated {{with a mean age}} of 46 years (range 29 - 68 years). Thematic analysis was conducted on the transcribed data using constant comparison techniques within and across the groups. We found that three major themes emerged from the discussions: reasons for delayed help-seeking, turning points and talking to professionals. Women expressed delaying help-seeking to the point when "Pani sar se guzar jata he" (water crosses over your head). Their dominant reasons for delayed help-seeking were social stigma, rigid gender roles, marriage obligations, expected silence, loss of social support after migration and limited knowledge about available resources and myths about partner abuse. Women usually turned for help only after experiencing pronounced mental and physical health problems. The findings are interpreted in light of participants' immigration context and the socio-cultural norms of patriarchy, collectivism and familism. Prevention approaches to address partner abuse and delayed help-seeking among South <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> women should include tailored community education, social services to reduce vulnerability, and cultural competency of professionals. Further research and program evaluation is needed to advance the field. Partner abuse Women South <b>Asian</b> <b>Immigrant</b> Help-seeking Canada...|$|R

The main aim {{of this study was to}} gain deeper knowledge of the educational experiences and needs of <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> high school students who reside in the Midwest. I conducted an in-depth case study using phenomenology as the theoretical framework to look into what it is like to be an <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> high school student in the Midwest. I obtained small samples, three foreign-born Asian high school students, a Chinese male, a Japanese female and a Filipina, and one second-generation Asian American high school student who still practices her heritage culture and language at home, at a Midwestern large urban high school. In order to collect data, I conducted my fieldwork at the Midwestern high school for four months. Direct observations and in-depth interviews were the principal components of my fieldwork. In this study, I found that the large urban high school in the Midwest that the <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> students in this study attend does not provide opportunities for them to embrace their ethnic background and to feel pride in their heritage. ^ The Asian students are marginalized in the host school society; consequently, their ethnic values as well as their voices are generally disregarded in the Midwestern educational environ. Additionally, I found that the recent <b>immigrant</b> <b>Asian</b> students in this study frequently experienced feelings of isolation due to their unfamiliarity with the dominant school culture and the language barriers between them and their mainstream peers. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the study}} of <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> {{communities}} and culture in North America, particularly in arts and literature, two intellectual approaches have emerged: the transnational which focuses on country and culture of origin regardless of {{the location of the}} diaspora community; and, the national which de-emphasizes diaspora in favour of a racial character distinct to the new generations of Asians born and residing in the U. S. and Canada today. In her talk, Angela Pao engages both approaches by presenting the benefits and drawbacks of examining social and cultural institutions, artistic products, and processes through a transnational and consequently de-territorialized perspective, as opposed to a domestic one that continues to emphasize Asian histories specific to a destination country or territory. Race and the context of uneven social and power relations between immigrant and local communities, more specifically, are the primary bases on which Pao examines the development of <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> culture, in particular, Chinese literature in North America, and its usefulness in helping interpret the local and global <b>Asian</b> <b>immigrant</b> experiences...|$|R
