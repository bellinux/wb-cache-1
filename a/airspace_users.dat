The strategy relies on subliminal speed control. Owing {{to the complexity of}} this kind of optimisation problem, a simulated annealing metaheuristic approach is employed. A scenario with four hours of traffic overflying the Spanish (structured, continental) airspace has been selected. Traffic has been retrieved from NEST Eurocontrol database with the corresponding wind ensemble probabilistic forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Due to uncertainties and to the little range of speed changing allowed by a subliminal control, it becomes not possible to resolve all conflicts.

40|$|The National Airspace System is {{a highly}} complex system of systems within which a number of {{participants}} with widely varying business and operating models exist. From the <b>airspace</b> <b>user's</b> perspective, {{a means by which}} to operate flights in a more flexible and efficient manner is highly desired to meet their business objectives.

Enhancing the communication between <b>airspace</b> operators and <b>users</b> is essential in order to meet these demands. In the spring of 2015, a prototype system that implemented an airborne tool to optimize en-route flight paths for fuel and time savings was designed and tested. The system utilized in-flight Internet as a high-bandwidth data link to facilitate collaborative decision making between the flight deck and an airline dispatcher. The system was tested and demonstrated in a laboratory environment, as well as in-situ.

40|$|Tailored Arrivals (TA) is a {{comprehensive}} method of planning, communicating, and flying highly-efficient arrival trajectories from cruise altitude to the runway threshold. TA trajectories are optimised for each aircraft to permit a fuel-efficient, low-noise descent profile that will provide separation assistance while complying with arrival sequencing requirements and other airspace constraints. With airline partnership and FAA support, NASA Ames and Boeing have recently embarked on a collaborative R&D effort aimed at TA concept exploration and system validation in the U. S. This effort will initially focus on trans-oceanic arrival operations due to the availability of airborne and ground-based data-link support infrastructure present in the oceanic control environment.

40|$|The modern {{aeronautical}} scenario has {{welcomed the}} massive diffusion of new key elements, including the Remote Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), initially used {{for military purposes}} only. The current decade has seen RPAS ready to become a new <b>airspace</b> <b>user</b> in a large variety of civilian applications. Although RPAS can currently only be flown into segregated airspaces, due to national and international Flight Aviation Authorities′ (FAAs) constraints, they represent a remarkable potential growth in terms of development and economic investments for aviation. Full RPAS development will only happen when flight into non‐segregated airspaces is authorized, as for manned civil and military aircraft. The preliminary requirement for disclosing the airspace to RPAS is the implementation of an ad hoc Safety Management System (SMS), as prescribed by ICAO, for every aeronautical operator. This issue arises {{in the context of}} the ongoing restructuring of airspaces management, according to SESAR‐JU in Europe and NextGen in the USA (SESAR‐JU has defined how RPAS research should be conducted in SESAR 2020, all in accordance with the 2015 European ATM Master Plan).

40|$|While en route, aircrews submit {{trajectory}} change {{requests to}} {{air traffic control}} (ATC) to better meet their objectives including reduced delays, reduced fuel burn, and passenger comfort. Aircrew requests are currently made with limited to no information on surrounding traffic. Consequently, these requests are uninformed about a key ATC objective, ensuring traffic separation, and therefore {{less likely to be}} accepted than requests informed by surrounding traffic and that avoids creating conflicts. This paper studies the benefits of providing aircrews with on-board decision support to generate optimized trajectory requests that are probed and cleared of known separation violations prior to issuing the request to ATC. These informed requests are referred to as traffic aware strategic aircrew requests (TASAR) and leverage traffic surveillance information available through Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) In capability. Preliminary fast-time simulation results show increased benefits with longer stage lengths since beneficial trajectory changes can be applied over a longer distance. Also, larger benefits were experienced between large hub airports as compared to other airport sizes. On average, an aircraft equipped with TASAR reduced its travel time by about one to four minutes per operation and fuel burn by about 50 to 550 lbs per operation depending on the objective of the aircrew (time, fuel, or weighted combination of time and fuel), class of <b>airspace</b> <b>user,</b> and aircraft type.

This new report takes into account, as far as possible, relevant changes in the economic and regulatory environment since the earlier work. Whilst account has also been taken of the limited literature since 2004, the authors {{are not aware of}} any other new work comprehensively addressing European airline delay costs. Cost comparisons between the values reported earlier and the 2010 values are in unadjusted Euros, unless stated otherwise. The report is designed as a reference document for European delay costs incurred by airlines, both at the strategic (planning) and tactical stages. Quantifying these costs is essential to the objectives of SESAR, offering future solutions to the <b>airspace</b> <b>user,</b> which are focused on the “best business outcome”?. It includes extensive tabulations of costs and guidelines on how to use them. The results may be used by airline operators to gain operationally meaningful insights into typical European delay costs, a pre-requisite of delay cost management, including trade-offs between delays in different phases of flight (e. g. en-route and at-gate) and for a range of specific aircraft types and cost scenarios, reflecting different airline cost bases. The results may equally be used by policy makers and airspace managers and designers to quantify the benefits of improved service delivery (such as more direct routes, fewer aircraft delays at-gate, etc.). Assigning these costs is complex and draws {{on a wide range of}} disciplines, with relatively little published elsewhere with regards to quantifying European costs. A number of the costs modelled necessarily draw on expert judgement and assumptions, based on published statistics and robust data wherever possible.

40|$|Aviation {{has grown}} {{dramatically}} over the last decades. Worldwide air traffic {{is expected to continue}} to grow at rates of 3 - 5 % per year. Air traffic currently experiences long delays at major airports, noticeable impact on the environment, and high work load on air traffic controllers. Future operational concepts to deal with these problems and to support sustainable growth of the Air Navigation Industry have been defined by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and major Air Traffic Control (ATC) authorities including both Eurocontrol and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). One of these concepts is User Preferred Routes (UPR), representing the routes with the best business outcome from the <b>airspace</b> <b>user’s</b> perspective. Aircraft would generally be free to fly user-preferred routes, and modify their trajectories without, or with minimal, intervention by ATC. There has been limited research on optimisation methods for UPR and on investigating the impact of UPR on the environment, delays, safety, etc. In this thesis a framework is designed and developed to find user preferred routes for flights and evaluate the UPR concept. The main contribution of the thesis is a set of three different methods for finding UPR. Through the experiments with the two first methods, which are based on Genetic Algorithms and Learning Classifier Systems and act as the black and white box optimisation approaches, we found the pros and cons for these different optimisation philosophies. The third method is a scalable algorithm that is fast and reliable. It can optimise routes efficiently for different mixes of users. To enable the investigation and optimisation of UPR, a simulation and evaluation environment is established. In this environment, I developed a real time weather system to retrieve and process weather data. This data is then stored in a database for aviation decision support in general and for aircraft UPR in particular. Second, flight and weather scenarios are designed to test UPR methods and assess user preferred routes provided by these methods. Third, a segment based simulation environment is developed to simulate any type of route segment (climb, cruise, or descent). The simulation uses point mass model of aircraft, and is implemented in a continuous environment, as well as in a fast time mode. This simulation environment is applied effectively and flexibly to evaluate UPR. The impact of different emissions on the environment is measured effectively. I developed a real time flight data management system with algorithms to process, estimate, and integrate information for every flight in the airspace and to construct flight objects. Then another real time system is developed to estimate aviation emission using the flight objects provided by the flight data management system. The aviation emission is stored in 4 -D database to analyse the impact of aviation emission on the environment. A number of models for emissions analysis are designed and implemented. The models developed here are then used for the calculation and analysis of fuel and emissions for UPR routes. I demonstrate that, if UPR routes that have been optimised either vertically or horizontally, they can help to reduce on average about 3 % and 2 % fuel burn in comparison with the original flight plans respectively. If UPR routes are optimised both vertically and horizontally, they can save on average 5 % fuel burn. I also demonstrate that the delay in departure times of UPR and non-UPR flights is insignificant (the average delay is less than 1 minute) ...|$|R

First of all, an introductory and theoretical study about aviation weather has been done being directly related with any type of flight, even it has been mainly focused on commercial ones. This short summary, gives a future user of this tool the appropriate environment, allowing him to easily recognize the causes of the obtained results that are associated to specific meteorological phenomena. Secondly, the methodology used to design a Matlab program able to optimize aerial trajectories in function of atmospheric conditions has been explained.

40|$|The National Airspace System (NAS) is a {{complicated}} large-scale aviation network, consisting of many static sectors wherein each sector is controlled {{by one or more}} controllers. The main purpose of the NAS is to enable safe and prompt air travel in the U. S. However, such static configuration of sectors {{will not be able to}} handle the continued growth of air travel which is projected to be more than double the current traffic by 2025. Under the initiative of the Next Generation of Air Transportation system (NextGen), the main objective of Adaptable Dynamic Airspace Configuration (ADAC) is that the sectors should change to the changing traffic so as to reduce the controller workload variance with time while increasing the throughput. Change in the resectorization should be such that there is a minimal increase in exchange of air traffic among controllers. The benefit of a new design (improvement in workload balance, etc.) should sufficiently exceed the transition cost, in order to deserve a change. This leads to the analysis of the concept of transition workload which is the cost associated with a transition from one sectorization to another. Given two airspace configurations, a transition workload metric which considers the air traffic as well as the geometry of the airspace is proposed. A solution to reduce this transition workload is also discussed. The algorithm is specifically designed to be implemented for the Dynamic Airspace Configuration (DAC) Algorithm. ^ A graph model which accurately represents the air route structure and air traffic in the NAS is used to formulate the airspace configuration problem. In addition, a multilevel graph partitioning algorithm is developed for Dynamic Airspace Configuration which partitions the graph model of <b>airspace</b> with given <b>user</b> defined constraints and hence provides the user more flexibility and control over various partitions. In terms of air traffic management, vertices represent airports and waypoints. Some of the major (busy) airports need to be given more importance and hence treated separately. Thus the algorithm takes into account the air route structure while finding a balance between sector workloads. ^ The performance of the proposed algorithms and performance metrics is validated with the Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS) air traffic data. ...|$|R
