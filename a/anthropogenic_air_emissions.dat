The preventative measures of mercury need to start from the detection and removal of the elemental form as (i) it represents 66 - 94 % of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>air</b> <b>emissions,</b> (ii) is hard to detect/remove and (iii) it can travel over long distances globally before converting to more toxic forms (oxidized/organic mercury). Therefore elemental mercury needs to be detected and removed at its point source before it can be converted into the more toxic compounds.

It also presents the national emissions of these substances in 2014 by the major source categories and defines the share of metal production in these emissions. Analysis is based on national emission inventory reports. Most important source of air emission in case of CO 2 and SO 2 is 1. A. 1 Energy industries category. TSP and PCDD/F are emitted mainly from fuel combustion in small sources (i. a. households). Emission of heavy metals (Pb and Cd) is connected mostly with 1. A. 2.

40|$|Wildfires pose a {{significant}} risk to human livelihoods {{and are a}} substantial health hazard due to emissions of toxic smoke. Previous {{studies have shown that}} climate change, increasing atmospheric CO 2, and human demographic dynamics can lead to substantially altered wildfire risk in the future, with fire activity increasing in some regions and decreasing in others. The present study re-examines these results from the perspective of air pollution risk, focussing on emissions of airborne particulate matter (PM 2. [*] 5), combining an existing ensemble of simulations using a coupled fire–dynamic vegetation model with current observation-based estimates of wildfire emissions and simulations with a chemical transport model. Currently, wildfire PM 2. [*] 5 emissions exceed those from anthropogenic sources in large parts of the world. We further analyse two extreme sets of future wildfire emissions in a socio-economic, demographic climate change context and compare them to anthropogenic emission scenarios reflecting current and ambitious air pollution legislation. In most regions of the world, ambitious reductions of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>air</b> pollutant <b>emissions</b> have the potential to limit mean annual pollutant PM 2. [*] 5 levels to comply with World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines for PM 2. [*] 5. Worst-case future wildfire emissions are not likely to interfere with these annual goals, largely due to fire seasonality, as well as a tendency of wildfire sources to be situated in areas of intermediate population density, as opposed to anthropogenic sources that tend to be highest at the highest population densities. However, during the high-fire season, we find many regions where future PM 2.

40|$|We use a {{regional}} model of atmospheric chemistry and transport to investigate trends in sulphur and nitrogen deposition over Europe {{during the first}} half of the 21 st century. To assess changes due to climate change, the model was operated with meteorology from {{a regional}} climate model simulating present and future climates. The sensitivity of the deposition calculations to uncertainties in the climate projections was explored by using output from three different climate models. Changes in <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>air</b> pollution <b>emissions</b> in Europe were extracted from the gridded RCP 4. 5 emission inventory. The modelling systems were evaluated by comparing average modelled precipitation, deposition and concentrations over a 20 -year period with observations collected around the year 2000. We conclude that the deposition of sulphur and nitrogen containing species will mainly be governed by changes in European emissions of these species over the period 2000 - 2050. If future emissions follow the pathway of the RCP 4. 5 scenario, Europe can expect significantly lower deposition of sulphur and oxidised nitrogen in 2050 compared to 2000. For reduced nitrogen, large areas of western Europe will receive considerably more deposition in 2050 than in 2000, due to feedback of decreased sulphur concentrations on the atmospheric turnover time of reduced nitrogen. Domain averaged reductions of total deposition from 2000 to 2050 are 63, 41 and 0. 9 % for sulphur, oxidised-and reduced nitrogen, respectively. Climate change results in decreased wet deposition of sulphur and reduced nitrogen leading to increased atmospheric turnover time of these species. Climate and emission changes lead to decreased atmospheric turnover times of reduced nitrogen but increased atmospheric turnover times of sulphur and oxidised nitrogen. These relations are likely leading to altered source-receptor relations in the future...|$|R

Modelers use emissions inventories {{to represent the}} temporal and spatial distribution of these emissions needed to estimate their impacts on regional and global air quality. However, large uncertainties exist in emissions estimates. Thus, assessing differences in these inventories {{is essential for the}} better understanding of air pollution over China. We compare five different emissions inventories estimating emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO x), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10  µm or less (PM 10) from China. The emissions inventories analyzed in this paper include the Regional Emission inventory in ASia v 2. 1 (REAS), the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC), the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research v 4. 2 (EDGAR), the inventory by Yu Zhao (ZHAO), and the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS). We focus on the period between 2000 and 2008, during which Chinese economic activities more than doubled. In addition to national totals, we also analyzed emissions from four source sectors (industry, transport, power, and residential) and within seven regions in China (East, North, Northeast, Central, Southwest, Northwest, and South) and found that large disagreements exist among the five inventories at disaggregated levels. These disagreements lead to differences of 67  µg m − 3, 15  ppbv, and 470  ppbv for monthly mean PM 10, O 3, and CO, respectively, in modeled regional concentrations in China. We also find that all the inventory emissions estimates create a volatile organic compound (VOC) -limited environment and MEIC emissions lead to much lower O 3 mixing ratio in East and Central China compared to the simulations using REAS and EDGAR estimates, due to their low VOC emissions. Our results illustrate that a better understanding of Chinese emissions at more disaggregated levels is essential for finding effective mitigation measures for reducing national and regional air pollution in China...|$|R
40|$|The Arctic is a {{sensitive}} region {{in terms of}} climate change and a rich natural resource for global economic activity. Arctic shipping is an important contributor to the region's <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>air</b> <b>emissions,</b> including black carbon – a short-lived climate forcing pollutant especially effective in accelerating the melting of ice and snow. These emissions are projected to increase as declining sea ice coverage due to climate change allows for increased shipping activity in the Arctic. To understand the impacts of these increased emissions, scientists and modelers require high-resolution, geospatial emissions inventories {{that can be used}} for regional assessment modeling. This paper presents 5 km&times; 5 km Arctic emissions inventories of important greenhouse gases, black carbon and other pollutants under existing and future (2050) scenarios that account for growth of shipping in the region, potential diversion traffic through emerging routes, and possible emissions control measures. Short-lived forcing of ~ 4. 5 gigagrams of black carbon from Arctic shipping may increase climate forcing; a first-order calculation of global warming potential due to 2030 emissions in the high-growth scenario suggests that short-lived forcing of ~ 4. 5 gigagrams of black carbon from Arctic shipping may increase climate forcing due to Arctic ships by at least 17 % compared to warming from these vessels' CO 2 emissions (~ 42 000 gigagrams). The paper also presents maximum feasible reduction scenarios for black carbon in particular. These emissions reduction scenarios will enable scientists and policymakers to evaluate the efficacy and benefits of technological controls for black carbon, and other pollutants from ships...|$|E

40|$|The {{monitoring}} of air quality to develop meaningful air programs and policies {{has been an}} on-going initiative {{in the province of}} Ontario, Canada. Ontario has been monitoring and reporting on air quality throughout the province since the 1970 s. In 1993 the Ontario Ministry of the Environment (MOE) embarked on its first effort to inventory Ontario’s point source emissions {{through the use of a}} voluntary survey. This survey was distributed annually to industrial facilities throughout the province, requesting annual activity data for the estimation of Ontario facility <b>air</b> <b>emissions.</b> This exercise consistently yielded a low response from Ontario point sources. In January of 2000, the MOE proposed an air quality initiative that would consist of a regulation requiring the mandatory monitoring and reporting of <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> from point sources. This proposal became reality when Ontario Regulation 227 (O. Reg. 227 / 00 - "Electricity Generation- Monitoring and Reporting") came into effect in May of 2000. This regulation applied to certain Ontario electricity generation facilities and regulated 28 airborne contaminants. The goal of a regulated <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> inventory program applicable to a wide spectrum facilities was realized when the MOE promulgated Ontario Regulation 127 (O. Reg. 127 / 01) regulating <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> from industrial, commercial, institutional, and municipal point sources in the province. Facilities are able to report their <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> under O. Reg. 127 / 01 via the MOE’s web-based reporting and registration site titled “OnAIR”. This study will chronicle the evolution of <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> inventories in the province of Ontario, describing the progression from voluntary to mandatory point source <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> reporting, provide observations of the <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> reports submitted by Ontario point sources, and discuss the future direction of <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> reporting in the province...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} the reduction of <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> from ships. Ships are large contributors to air pollution with implications for climate change and human health. Regulations have entered into force or will in the near future, which will force shipowners to reduce the <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> from their vessels. Multiple technologies or operational measures reducing these main pollutants are available and the term <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> control has here been defined as any effort made by ship-owners, operators or designers {{to reduce the amount}} of <b>emission</b> to <b>air</b> from a vessel. Knowing which <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> control to install and when to do so to comply with regulations is a challenging decision problem. This thesis develops optimization models for selecting <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> controls enabling a ship to comply with <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> regulations. This work consists of four papers. The first one establishes the <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> reduction problem in shipping and presents a deterministic optimization problem solving it.

The aims of this study are to calculate <b>air</b> <b>emissions,</b> modeling of <b>air</b> quality and discuss emission abatement strategies for Saigon port, Vietnam. Saigon Port within the port system of the Vietnam Maritime sector is one the port having the highest throughput and productivity in the country. The air quality in the area around the port is polluted. Then the <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> results are used for modelling air quality in Saigon Port.

40|$|Advanced {{petroleum}} {{and natural}} gas production technologies are increasingly used to help meet the demand for energy in both the United States and globally. As conventional resources become more scarce, research and innovation by {{the oil and gas}} industry has resulted in techniques for tapping unconventional resources, including hydrocarbons trapped in shale formations found in a number of locations throughout the United States. A key technology for accessing such resources is hydraulic fracturing (fracking), which has transformed natural gas production over the past several years and is also being applied for oil production. These new energy supply technologies also bring new environmental management challenges. Among the issues of concern are the <b>air</b> pollution <b>emissions</b> from fracking operations and whether they can potentially impact air quality at well sites and in surrounding communities. A significant opportunity exists to improve the sustainability of energy production by reducing the <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> from fracking operations. This Master’s Project focuses on the characterization and modeling of these <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> to help improve environmental management efforts by the industry and to inform the application of regulations for guiding efforts to reduce emissions. The emissions addressed include criteria air pollutants and their precursors. The work involved identifying major sources of emissions during fracking operations, evaluating current models used for <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> characterization, and developing refinements to the models to enable better emissions management. The project team travelled to a well site and to testing facilities to learn about operations in two different shale formations and to gather data needed to improve emissions characterization.
