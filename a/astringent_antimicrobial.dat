However, these fungi may cause opportunistic infections in humans with certain physiological disorders, or in patients who have become immunocompromised or are undergoing therapy with istic mycoses are caused by Candida sp. [1], and C. albi-cans is still the major pathogenic species worldwide, causing 90 % of vulvovaginal candidiasis [2] and 50 – 70 % of invasive candidiasis cases [3], with a mortality rate of 30 – 40 % [3]. In Brazil, Stryphnodendron adstringens (Mart.) Coville (Leguminosae) is one of the most frequently used medi-cinal plants in the treatment of vaginal infections and wounds, and it is also used as <b>astringent,</b> anti-diarrhoeal, <b>antimicrobial</b> or hypoglycaemic agent [4].

50|$|Varaka is {{mentioned}} in several ancient Sanskrit documents, particularly in Ayurvedic and medical literature. Varaka means cloth, cloak or {{a thing that}} covers something else. The word varaka {{is mentioned}} with swarna (gold), tara (silver) or rupera (silver) in these documents; the discussion is in three forms of these precious metals: patra (leaf), varaka (thin foil) and bhasma (ash). Ayurvedic documents consider silver as an <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>astringent,</b> while gold is claimed to be an aphrodisiac. This {{is not unique to}} Indian subcontinent; in Europe, edible gold (Aureum potabile) and silver were also claimed to have medicinal properties; later studies found that they can indeed be antibacterial owing to Oligodynamic effect.|$|R

40|$|The {{roots of}} Krameria lappacea are used {{traditionally}} against oropharyngeal inflammation. So far, the <b>astringent</b> and <b>antimicrobial</b> properties of its proanthocyanidin constituents {{are considered to}} account for the anti-inflammatory effect. The aim {{of the present study was}} to characterize pharmacologically a lipophilic extract of K. lappacea roots and several isolated lignan derivatives (111) in terms of their putative anti-inflammatory activity. The dichloromethane extract (ID 50 77 μg/cm 2) as well compounds 111 (ID 50 0. 310. 60 μmol/cm 2) exhibited topical antiedematous properties comparable to those of indomethacin (ID 50 0. 29 μmol/cm 2) in a mouse ear in vivo model. Two of the most potent compounds, 2 -(2 -hydroxy- 4 -methoxyphenyl) - 5 -(3 -hydroxypropyl) benzofuran (5) and (+) -conocarpan (7), were studied regarding their time-dependent edema development and leukocyte infiltration up to 48 h after croton oil-induced dermatitis induction, and they showed activity profiles similar to that of hydrocortisone. In vitro studies of the isolated lignan derivatives demonstrated the inhibition of NFkB, cyclooxygenase- 1 and - 2, 5 -lipoxygenase, and microsomal prostaglandin E 2 synthase- 1 as well as antioxidant properties, as mechanisms possibly contributing to the observed in vivo effects. The present findings not only support the ethnopharmacological use of K. lappacea roots but also reveal that the isolated lignan derivatives contribute strongly to the anti-inflammatory activity of this herbal drug...|$|R
40|$|Leaves of Arrabidaea chica (Bonpl.) B. Verl., Bignoniaceae, are {{commonly}} used in the Amazon region as anti-inflammatory, <b>antimicrobial,</b> <b>astringent</b> and as a wound healing agent. In the Southeast Region of Brazil, this species is used for urinary infection treatment. Ethanol extract from leaves of Arrabidaea chica and its fractions were prepared and tested for antioxidant, cytotoxic, antibacterial and diuretic activities. All samples, {{with the exception of}} the hexane fraction, showed a potential antioxidant activity. Hexane, ethyl acetate fraction and luteolin, a flavone isolated from dichlorometane fraction, demonstrated diuretic activity. None of the samples assayed showed cytotoxicity or antimicrobial activity. Therefore, our results suggest that folk use to treat urinary tract infections may be modulated by the diuretic activity found, since increase of water diuresis serves to ‘flush out’ the urinary tract of infecting organisms. This could reduce bacterial multiplication in the bladder...|$|R
40|$|Sara F Maher Physical Therapy Program, Department of Healthcare Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA Abstract: Topical zinc {{has been}} used in the {{treatment}} of wounds for over 3, 000 years, and is reported to have antiseptic, <b>astringent,</b> anti-inflammatory, <b>antimicrobial,</b> and wound healing properties. Fourteen studies were identified and reviewed, to assess the efficacy of this treatment modality as either a bandage or skin protectant in the treatment of venous ulcers. The authors of three studies reported improved healing time or success rate in wounds treated with zinc-based products. However, the authors of one study attributed the faster healing rate mainly to the extra compression (that improved venous blood return), delivered by the non-elastic paste bandage, and not by the zinc oxide alone. The quality of evidence is fair, as 50 % of the studies were conducted prior to 2000 and 50 % of the studies utilized fewer than 45 patients randomized to two or more groups. Other treatments have been reported to be more cost-effective than zinc, including hydrocolloids, four-layer compression systems, and CircAid Thera-boots. Finally, zinc was reported to be less comfortable, less easy to use, and caused increased pain, in comparison to other products on the market. This literature review, therefore, demonstrated that current evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of zinc-based products in the treatment of venous wounds. Future research is needed focusing on larger, high-quality trials with an emphasis on quality of life issues and cost-effectiveness of treatment. Keywords: chronic wounds, leg ulcers, venous insufficiency, topical zin...|$|R
40|$|Arbutin {{is found}} in the dried leaves of a number of {{different}} plant species including bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi). The leaves and leaf extracts from uva ursi are used in non-prescription medicinal products mainly to treat urinary tract infection, cystitis, kidney stones, and as a diuretic. The active component, arbutin, is converted to hydroquinone (HQ) which has <b>antimicrobial,</b> <b>astringent,</b> and disinfectant properties. Arbutin is also an inhibitor of melanin formation and is use in some skin-lightening products. It is rapidly metabolized and excreted in rats as unchanged arbutin and in humans as HQ, HQ glucuronide, and HQ sulfate. HQ induced renal tubule adenomas in male rats and liver adenomas and thyroid gland follicular cell hyperplasia in mice. It was negative in the Ames assay but induced mutations and micronuclei in mouse L 5178 Y lymphoma and chromosome aberrations and sister-chromatid exchange in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Side effects reported from the ingestion of dried uva ursi leaves included nausea and vomiting, irritability, insomnia, and an increased heart rate. Extremely high doses can cause ringing in the ears, shortness of breath, convulsions, collapse, and delirium. Uva ursi has also been linked with albuminuria, hematuria, and urine cast; liver damage is also a risk with long-term use. In vitro studies of human melanocytes exposed to arbutin at concentrations below 30...|$|R
40|$|Background: Purple coneflower (Echinaceae purpurea L.) is a {{perennial}} herbaceous with <b>astringent</b> properties, disinfectant, <b>antimicrobial</b> and anti intoxication activity. The main {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of shoot essential oil of purple coneflower against some microorganisms including gram positive, gram negative bacteria, filamentous fungi and yeasts. Material and Methods: In this experimental and laboratory investigation, plant samples were collected in full blooming stage. Shoot essential oil was extracted by hydro-distillation technique using Clevenger apparatus. The chemical constitutes of this oil was analyzed by GC and GC/MS method. Anti microbial properties of the essential oil were determined using micro broth dilution and well disk diffusion methods. At the end, data were analyzed by the SPSS version 15 software, using the T-test and Duncan s' test. Results: Twenty nine components were identified by GC and GC/MS in the essential oil of purple coneflower representing 96. 21 % of total oil. The major components were Germacrene D (53. 30 %), -Cymene (9. 78 %), β-Caryophyllene (7. 52 %), α-Humulene (5. 22 %), β-Bisabolene (4. 43 %) and α-Pinene (4. 23 %), respectively. This oil exhibited strong antifungal activity against filamentous fungi and yeast with average of inhibition zone (AIZ) 39. 63. Microorganisms differ in their resistance to purple coneflower oil. All of the bacteria including gram positive and gram negative bacteria are more resistant than fungi and gram negative bacteria are more resistant than gram positive bacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium were more resistant than others. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that coneflower essential oil with significant antimicrobial effects and can be used instead of synthetic antibiotics that microbial resistance towards them is increasing...|$|R
40|$|For ages {{plants have}} not only been used as a source of food but also to prevent or treat various diseases. Their healing effects are {{provided}} by biologically active substances, especially the products of secondary metabolism. Primary metabolites, such as carbohydrates, lipids and proteins, are particularly important from the nutritive point of view. They are {{an essential part of}} our diet. The same level of importance also applies to vitamins that serve as catalysts in a great number of metabolic reactions. The aim of this thesis was to describe biologically active substances found in medicinal plants of the Rosaceae, Lamiaceae and Asteraceae families and to summarize their effects on human health. These families include many species of plants that have demonstrated positive effects on human health. The effects are mainly attributed to phenolic compounds, most of which are represented by flavonoids, phenolic acids and tannins. Furthermore, essential oils and vitamin C also have a positive impact on our health. Medicinal plants from the previously mentioned families often have <b>astringent,</b> spasmolytic and <b>antimicrobial</b> properties, for which they owe to phenolic compounds, especially tannins, flavonoids and phenolic acids. Due to the content of essential oils and their spasmolytic effects they counteract cramps and diarrhoea, increase the production and secretion of bile and also have antimicrobial effects. Plants that contain vitamin C, an important antioxidant, can boost our immunity in general. Another aim of this work was to define external factors that can influence the content and the metabolism of biologically active substances. Considering climatic conditions we have to mention temperature and light, which primarily influence the content of essential oils. Other factors could be soil composition, methods of cultivation, harvesting and post-harvest processing. During the process of drying there comes the loss of essential oils and vitamin C. The integral part of this thesis was also to create an overview of selected medicinal plants of the Rosaceae, Lamiaceae and Asteraceae families, thein plant-based drugs, biologically active substances and their effects on human health...|$|R
