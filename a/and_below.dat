Finally, Ras Ali and Kassa fought the battle in Ayshal and Ras Ali fled to Yeju after losing the battle.

5|$|All three regiments of the NK 2nd Division-the 4th, 17th, and 6th, in {{line from}} north to south-crossed during the night to {{the east side of}} the Naktong River into the 23rd Regiment sector. The NK 2nd Division, {{concentrated}} in the Sinban-ni area west of the river, had, in effect, attacked straight east across the river and was trying to seize the two avenues of advance into Changnyong above <b>and</b> <b>below</b> Lake U-p'o. On August 31, 1950, Lake U-p'o was a large body of water although in most places very shallow.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the closest}} scattered-disc objects {{approach}} the Sun at about 30–35AU, their orbits can extend well beyond 100AU. This makes scattered objects {{among the most}} distant and coldest objects in the Solar System. The innermost portion of the scattered disc overlaps with a torus-shaped region of orbiting objects traditionally called the Kuiper belt, but its outer limits reach much further away from the Sun and further above <b>and</b> <b>below</b> the ecliptic than the Kuiper belt proper.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage for {{equipment}} and positions was extensively developed for military {{use by the}} French in 1915, soon followed by other World War I armies. In both world wars, artists were recruited as camouflage officers. Ship camouflage developed via conspicuous dazzle camouflage schemes during WWI, but since the development of radar, ship camouflage has received less attention. Aircraft, especially in World War II, were often painted with different schemes above <b>and</b> <b>below,</b> to camouflage them against the ground and sky respectively.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s, Walter Alvarez {{was doing}} {{geologic}} research in central Italy. There he had located an outcrop {{on the walls}} of a gorge whose limestone layers included strata both above <b>and</b> <b>below</b> the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. Exactly at the boundary is a thin layer of clay. Walter told his father that the layer marked where the dinosaurs and much else became extinct and that nobody knew why, or what the clay was about — it was a big mystery and he intended to solve it.|$|E
5|$|Each worm {{begins the}} round with a {{specific}} amount of health, which is predefined by the chosen game options or by scripting in campaign levels.

All students of HCI's high school section also move on automatically to the college section and undertake the GCE Advanced Level examination, unless they fail to meet requirements (students must have an MSG of 3.00 <b>and</b> <b>below</b> {{at the end of}} Secondary 4) or specifically applied to leave.|$|E

5|$|In most of Brassey's {{contracts}} {{he worked}} in partnership with other contractors, in particular with Peto and Betts. The planning {{of the details of}} the projects was done by the engineers. Sometimes there would be a consulting engineer <b>and</b> <b>below</b> him another engineer {{who was in charge of}} the day-to-day activities. During his career Brassey worked with many engineers, the most illustrious being Robert Stephenson, Joseph Locke and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The day-to-day work was overseen by agents, who managed and controlled the activities of the subcontractors.|$|E

Mendelevium metal has not yet been prepared in bulk quantities, and bulk preparation is currently impossible. Nevertheless, a number of predictions and some preliminary experimental results have been done regarding its properties.|$|E
5|$|Instead, {{a system}} of {{multiple}} receiver antennas was adopted, each one located so that only a certain section of the sky was visible. Two horizontal receivers were mounted {{on either side of}} the fuselage and only saw reflections from the left or right, slightly overlapping in the middle. Two vertical receivers were mounted above <b>and</b> <b>below</b> the wing, seeing reflections above or below the aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Killer whales {{have good}} {{eyesight}} above <b>and</b> <b>below</b> the water, excellent hearing, {{and a good}} sense of touch. They have exceptionally sophisticated echolocation abilities, detecting the location and characteristics of prey and other objects in their environments by emitting clicks and listening for echoes, as do other members of the dolphin family.|$|E
5|$|Like other theridiid spiders, the web is a disorganised, {{irregular}} {{tangle of}} fine textured silk. It is hammock-shaped and {{is made up}} of opaque yellowish-white silk. The web consists of a broad base with many supporting threads above <b>and</b> <b>below,</b> including a number of sticky guy lines anchored to debris in the sand. A cone-shaped retreat is built in {{the lower part of the}} web, although the katipo can normally be found near the main body of the web. The plants it builds its web in provide support and shelter for the nest.|$|E
5|$|Long, highly {{sensitive}} whiskers and front paws help the sea otter find prey by touch when waters are dark or murky. Researchers have noted when they approach in plain view, sea otters react more rapidly {{when the wind}} is blowing towards the animals, indicating the sense of smell is more important than sight as a warning sense. Other observations indicate the sea otter's sense of sight is useful above <b>and</b> <b>below</b> the water, although not as good as that of seals. Its hearing is neither particularly acute nor poor.|$|E
