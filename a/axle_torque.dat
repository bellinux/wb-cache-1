50|$|The first {{generation}} 4Matic system was originally a complex electronically controlled system with automatically engaging four-wheel drive (4WD), the system employs locking central and rear differentials {{to provide additional}} traction in slippery conditions. The centre differential, {{also known as the}} transfer case, contains two clutches. Each hydraulically enabled clutch is controlled separately to allow for three modes of operation: 2WD (mode 0) where 100% of available torque is available to the rear axle while the front axle is disconnected, and two 4WD modes which allow for 35/65 front/rear <b>axle</b> <b>torque</b> split (mode 1) or 50/50 front/rear <b>axle</b> <b>torque</b> split (mode 2). The rear differential lock, previously known as ASD on Mercedes-Benz models, can also be locked (mode 3) if rear wheel slip is still present when the transfer case 50/50 4WD mode 2 is engaged. Due to safety and stability concerns there is no front differential lock. The 4Matic system uses inputs from the three channel ABS system and a steering wheel angle sensor to decide when to intervene. 4WD is disengaged automatically if the ABS service brakes are applied. Engine throttle control is not inherent in the W124 system. Two W124 variants of the 4Matic system were produced: the first system (1986-1991) used a mechanical pressure test lever to disable the system hydraulically while the second system variant (1992/1993) used an electrical test switch to break power to the system. The later system variant when in test mode allows for continued operation of the rear shock self-levelling system (SLS) when installed. Initially plagued with reliability factors, the multi-plate clutch central differentials were subject to failure; it was discontinued in 1993.|$|E

50|$|How: Normally {{front-wheel drive}} vehicle. A Haldex Traction LSC unit may divert up {{to a maximum}} 100% of the torque to the rear axle as {{conditions}} warrant. Many people find the torque distribution on Haldex Traction systems confusing. Under normal operating conditions, the Haldex LSC clutch operates at 5% (divide 5% between front and rear, and 97.5% torque goes to the front, and 2.5% goes to the rear). Under adverse conditions where both front wheels lose traction, the Haldex clutch can lock at 100% clamping force. This means, that {{since there is no}} torque transferred to the front <b>axle,</b> all <b>torque</b> (minus losses) must be transferred to the rear <b>axle.</b> The <b>torque</b> split between left and right wheels is achieved with a conventional open differential. If one side of the driven axle loses grip, then the Electronic Differential Lock (EDL) controls this. EDL brakes a single spinning wheel, and therefore torque gets transferred to the opposite wheel via the open differential. On all transverse-engined cars with the Haldex Traction LSC four-wheel drive system, the EDL only controls the front wheels, and not the rear.|$|R

5000|$|The {{architecture}} of an AWD/4WD {{system can be}} described by describing its possible operating modes. A single vehicle may {{have the ability to}} operate in multiple modes depending on driver selection. Mohan describes the modes as follows:Two Wheel Drive (2WD) Mode - In this mode only one axle (typically the rear axle) is driven. The drive to the other axle is disconnected. The operating torque split ratio is 0:100. Four Wheel Drive (4WD) Mode - Here, depending on the nature of torque transfer to the axles, we can define three sub-modes (below).:Part-time Mode - The front and rear axle drives are rigidly coupled in the transfer case. Since the driveline does not permit any speed differentiation between the axles and would cause driveline wind-up, this mode is recommended only for ‘part-time’ use in off-road or loose surface conditions where driveline wind-up is unlikely. Up to full torque could go to either axle depending on the road condition and the weight over the axles. :Full-time Mode - Both axles are driven at all times but an inter-axle differential permits the axles to turn at different speeds as needed. This allows the vehicle to be driven ‘full-time’ in this mode, regardless of the road surface, without fear of driveline wind-up. With standard bevel gear differentials the torque split is 50:50. Planetary differentials can provide asymmetric torque splits as needed. A system that operates permanently in the full-time mode is sometimes called ‘All-the-Time 4WD’, 'All-Wheel-Drive' or ‘AWD’. If the inter-axle differential is locked out then the mode reverts to a ‘part-time mode’. :On-Demand Mode - In this mode the transfer case operates primarily in the 2WD mode. Torque is transferred to the secondary axle as needed by modulating the transfer clutch from ‘open’ to a rigidly coupled state while avoiding any driveline wind-up. The torque modulation may be achieved by active electronic/hydraulic control systems, or by passive devices, based on wheel slip or wheel torque, as described in the section on traction control systems.In addition to these basic modes there could be implementations that combine these modes. The system could have a clutch across the center differential, for example, capable of modulating the front <b>axle</b> <b>torque</b> from a Full-time mode with the 30:70 torque split of the center differential to the 0:100 torque split of the 2WD mode ...|$|E

Usual kinematics con-straints are not always sufficient to provide feasible trajectories; thus, we focus on velocity limitation and the motor’s current and slew rate constraints. Optimal velocity is determined for AGVs along a specified path with a known curvature. The main result concerns the realistic situation when the parameters of the model describing the movement of the vehicle are not well known.

40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} to reveal the effect of different tillage depths, hence, different draft forces required by a plow, on the weight transferred from a tractor front axle to rear axle, and on the torque applied to tractor rear wheels.

In addition to the horizontal draft force, the dynamic weights on tractor front and rear axle were measured for each tillage depth and transferred weight was determined. For each tillage depth, total increase in tractor rear axle weight (transferred weight plus effect of draft force) was calculated. Increase in torque at the tractor rear wheels due to the total increase in rear axle weight was also determined. Results showed that, when the tillage depth increased from 5 to 25 cm, the average required horizontal draft force increased from 10. 55 to 15. 45 kN (46. 4 %), however, front axle dynamic weight decreased, on the average, from 18. 20 to 14. 50 kN (20. 3 %).

Equipment performance and in-field efficiency are two variables that can be improved to minimize fuel consumption and ultimately reduce input costs for crop production. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of transmission gear selection on fuel costs, draft, and other equipment performance variables using two deep tillage implements. Three different transmission gears were selected which represented slow, normal, and fast operating speeds for two typical in-row, integral subsoilers (KMC generation I rip-strip and Bigham Brothers ParatillTM). Tractor fuel consumption, slip, <b>axle</b> <b>torque,</b> and engine speed were measured in real-time along with transverse and vertical draft forces. Results indicated a 105 % increase in fuel consumption rate, a 28 % increase in implement draft, and a 255 % increase in power between the slow and fast speed for the ParatillTM. The KMC showed a 115 % increase in fuel consumption rate, a 37 % increase in implement draft, and a 283 % increase in power between the slow and fast speeds. Good comparisons were found between measured and estimated, using published equations, for fuel consumption (- 5. 3 % to 4. 9 %) and draft (- 3. 6 % to 17. 7 %). For the ParatillTM, the normal speed produced the lowest fuel cost ($ 5. 10 /ha) but operating at this speed reduced productivity rate from 4. 55 ha/h at the fast speed down to 3. 23 ha/h. Conversely, the KMC fast speed provided the lowest fuel cost ($ 5. 35 /ha) and highest productivity rate (4. 35 ha/h) for this implement. In general, the ParatillTM provided the highest productivity and lowest fuel cost when operated at the typical speeds in the Southeastern US (around the normal to fast) mostly likely due to the lower required draft. In summary, the minimum fuel usage for each implement occurred at a different ground speed however, productivity was maximized at the fast speed with data reported useful to practitioners managing these style tillage implements...|$|E
