These platforms further reiterate the need for individuals to compare themselves with others online, resulting in higher expectations towards their standards of beauty. Hence, 42% of women stated social media caused them to feel worse about their bodies, while another study by the University of South Australia, discovered that individuals who frequently uploaded or viewed appearance-related items were more likely to internalise the thin ideal.|$|E

In 1962, Cardinale was interviewed by the writer Alberto Moravia, who focused exclusively on her sexuality <b>and</b> <b>body</b> <b>image</b> in film, treating her as an object. Cardinale remarked to him: [...] "I used my body as a mask, as a representation of myself". The interview was published in Esquire under the title [...] "The Next Goddess of Love".

2500|$|In a {{study done}} at Old Dominion University, Thomas F. Cash, Julie R. Ancis and Melissa D. Strachan studied college women and their attitudes toward gender, feminist {{identity}} <b>and</b> <b>body</b> <b>image.</b> [...] "Relative to men, women are considerably more psychologically invested in their appearance. Moreover, women's poor evaluations of and stronger investments in their looks potentiate greater body-image dysphoria in women's daily lives." [...] A contributing factor in this scenario that leads women to greater objectification of their bodies are the images that are seen throughout media. Women who are portrayed in the media often possess unattainable beauty. [...] "Furthermore, the social construct of femininity is partially tied to perceived beauty, as evinced by the 'what is beautiful sex-typed' stereotype." [...] These internalized ideals along with the pursuit for this unattainable beauty of one's body image can lead to body dysmorphic disorder, body objectification, eating disorders, anxiety, depression and other related psychological difficulties.|$|E
