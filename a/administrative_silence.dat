50|$|As to 2011, a {{research}} by the Open Cyprus Project showed {{that there was a}} level of 75% of <b>administrative</b> <b>silence</b> island-wide, in response to information requests. Over half of the respondents to this survey stated that, in practice, access to key documents is not possible.|$|E
50|$|The {{process for}} {{appealing}} an administrative decision on FOI requests has two phases: {{the first is}} ad administrative complaint filed to the respective agency; the second is to the courts. The first procedure also covers <b>administrative</b> <b>silence,</b> meaning when no answer is provided within the legal time frame. As for appeals to the courts, enforcement of the FOIA has widely relied on the judicial system and on precedents by courts sanctions.|$|E
40|$|<b>Administrative</b> <b>silence</b> is a {{situation}} in which the competent authority, within the statutory deadline, has not issued an administrative act at the request of the party. In the case of <b>administrative</b> <b>silence,</b> given the fact that the citizens are unable to protect their rights and legal interests without an administrative act, they are provided with legal protection. In this case, the same legal relationship is created, directly on the basis of the statute, as in the situation in which the party's request is rejected. This means that the party may, under the conditions prescribed by the statute, initiate the procedure of judicial review of <b>administrative</b> <b>silence.</b> In the paper, the author explains the conditions under which the judicial review of <b>administrative</b> <b>silence</b> can be initiated and the role of the court in this judicial procedure...|$|E

Šutnja uprave tako se izdvaja iz šireg problema neaktivnosti javne uprave te nakon toga promatra u svjetlu osnovnih načela postupovnoga prava za jamčenih pojedinim ustavnim i zakonskim odredbama u Republici Hrvatskoj. Također, ukratko se opisuje razvoj instituta zaštite građana od šutnje uprave. Osnovni smjerovi i sustavi zaštite stranaka od šutnje uprave detaljnije se razrađuju te iznose dobre i loše strane svakoga od njih. U zaključku rada zalaže se za dosljednu primjenu sustava negativne fikcije kojim se uspješno rješavaju problemi koje šutnja uprave nameće. At the {{beginning}} of the paper the author stresses the importance of expedient procedure {{for the rule of law}} in modern states. It is necessary to establish normative mechanisms that would protect the citizens from stalling in administrative and court procedures. The protection of citizens from stalling of administrative procedures, i. e., from the <b>administrative</b> <b>silence,</b> has had a place in Croatian law for a long time – it is regulated by the Law on General Administrative Procedure and Law on Administrative Disputes. After the term <b>administrative</b> <b>silence</b> has been related to the wider terms of not doing and neglect of administration, the issue of <b>administrative</b> <b>silence</b> is considered with regard to the fundamental values and purpose of procedural law, i. e., to the principles of legal security, equality, and justice. The author points out that the <b>administrative</b> <b>silence</b> is contrary to all the stated principles. The second part of the paper briefly outlines the development of protection of citizens from the <b>administrative</b> <b>silence</b> in the French, Austrian, and Croatian laws, respectively. The main part of the paper contains the description of two different approaches to <b>administrative</b> <b>silence</b> – the one that gives certain importance to it, and the other that denies it any importance at all. Thus, by describing silence of administration as an occurrence that has certain meaning, the author outlines advantages and disadvantages of two opposite fictions – the positive one and the negative one. He also describes the problems that may occur if <b>administrative</b> <b>silence</b> is denied any importance. In the conclusion, the author supports a consistent implementation and evelopment of the system of negative fiction in the Republic of Croatia...|$|E
40|$|Macedonian {{municipalities}} should pass anti-corruption ordinances {{in order}} to reduce corruption. The paper reviews the legal issues involved in drafting such ordinances and provides legal advisors to local councils with the legal and economic analysis needed to tackle some of the more difficult and detailed questions. The most important issue revolves around the creation of a model ordinance which Macedonian municipalities (or the Association of Units of Local Self-Government of the Republic of Macedonia) could adopt {{in order to}} set-up and run municipal-level anti-corruption agencies. The location of such agencies as well as their competencies (to monitor conflicts of interests, oversee asset declarations, and conduct corruption risk-audits among others) are analysed. The paper also provides legal interpretations of Macedonian legislation and their likely impact on municipal council ordinance design in the area of anti-corruption - providing the legal basis for positive <b>administrative</b> <b>silence,</b> the splitting of municipal procurement contracts, and (most controversially) qui tam rewards at the municipal level. A brief regulatory impact analysis of the ordinance shows a gain of Euro 162, 900 in social welfare if such a programme were rolled-out in Macedonia. ...|$|E
40|$|In the Republic of Macedonia "administrative silence" means a legal {{presumption}} {{according to which}} {{on the occasion of}} a request submitted by the party to the state authority, the authority does not respond to the request in the legally prescribed period and it is considered rejected by the party's request. However in this general rule of "administrative silence means rejection" there is an exception, which is widely represented in the substantive law. This research proves that the application of "administrative silence" in the Law of Administrative Procedure does not produce efficiency in resolving legal complaints. Furthermore, it confirms that precise and clear establishment of "administrative silence means approval” in the Law on Administrative Procedure as an exception to the general rule can positively affect handling of administrative cases and shall exercise their rights, obligations and legal interests of the parties in the administrative procedure. This research addresses the basic principles of administrative procedure and mostly the principles closely related to the institute of "administrative silence means approval”. Furthermore, this research examines the question whether the institute of "administrative silence means approval" can be equally applicable to all of the administrative procedures. The response is, of course, negative. The conclusion from the survey implies that that the current rule "administrative silence means rejection" provides guidelines and recommendations for future successful and simpler treatment by introducing the model of "administrative silence means approval" where it does not jeopardize the public interest and does not violate the rights of the third parties. Moreover, this research contributes to strengthening, improvement and further development of the principles of effective public administration and greater achievement of the "administrative silence" institute in the Republic of Macedonia. Keywords: <b>administrative</b> <b>silence,</b> administration, legal structure, practical applicability, principles, efficiency, responsibility. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{reform of}} {{administrative}} procedure and the applicable General Administrative Procedure Act (GAPA) calls {{for determining the}} 'open' and 'disputable' issues {{in the application of}} this Act. The process of reforming the administrative legislation does not only imply taking into account the EU standards but also considering the complex, abundant and diverse national administrative practice and case law. The Serbian administrative practice points to some 'open' questions in the application of the current GAPA which should be the cornerstones in the reform of administrative legislation. In that course, it is crucial to start from the current administrative legislation and administrative practice. It is worth noting that the GAPA is already subject to permanent reform through the process of amending the subject-specific substantive provisions governing special administrative proceedings. Such practice should be upheld because the area of special administrative procedure is a dynamic environment where the APA is actually being modeled by amending the special administrative proceedings but in full compliance with the fundamental GAPA principles. Thus, the GAPA should be subject to minimal reform, primarily in the regulation of those procedural matters which have already passed the application test in both national and comparative practice; these 'safe points of reference' significantly improve the process in line with the basic administrative principles and largely contribute to its efficiency, as opposed to other alternative proposals on procedural solutions. The basic presumption for a successful APA reform is the functional analysis of the Draft GAPA. Some of the disputable issues include {{the subject matter of the}} GAPA, the enactment of administrative acts and concluding administrative agreements. In case of expanding the scope of the GAPA subject matter, the legislator is obliged to expressly regulate the administrative proceeding for concluding administrative agreements under the GAPA rules. This can be achieved either by amending the APA or by enacting a subject-specific act. The former option includes a number of possible solutions that we may consider (the Croatian APA, the ghastly Serbian draft GAPA, or the relevant application of the Public Procurement Act, etc.). Another previous and/or related question is what kind of concept of administrative procedure we shall opt for: the narrow (Austrian) or the broader (German) concept, where any action of the public administration is regarded as an administrative proceeding. There is a number of other disputable issues open for further discussion: shall the public authority be delegated only by means of a legislative act or agreement, and who is to scrutinize these processes; what is the inter-relation between the administrative procedure and the inspection procedure (in terms of general and subject-specific administrative procedures, or special administrative proceedings); can the administrative procedure institutes be accordingly applied in the inspection procedure (e. g., 'silence' of the inspection); what is the statutory time limit for the validity of interim administrative decisions; are the extraordinary legal remedies justifiable; is it practicable to shorten the time limit for issuing a decision; is the favorable concept of <b>administrative</b> <b>silence</b> sustainable; what are the legal effects of the E-governance procedure, etc...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse the {{institutional}} problems which restrain the repatriation of refugees and displaced persons to and within Bosnia and Hercegovina with examples from the municipalities of Ilidza, Bosnia and Hercegovina. With intention to fulfil the {{aim of this}} study we will try to answer what problems that are connected to the Dayton Peace Agreement and how those problems impact the repatriation issue. Further we intend to discern what role the culture, values and norms play in the repatriation process. We also try to answer what formal institutional problems exist in BiH and what importance they constitute on the repatriation process. Finally we are discussing whether it is possible or not to institutionalise the repatriation process. The thesis is based on the interviews we made in BiH during the spring 2001. During the war in BiH, more than 2, 3 million people were displaced from their homes. Each of the wartime regimes allocated abandoned properties and established complex legal and administrative barriers to return, designed to make the separation of the population irreversible. In this way the separation of the population was permanent. Several years of international efforts have achieved a legal framework that recognises property rights as they stood at the beginning of the conflict, and establishes a legal and administrative claims process for the repossession of the property. DPA is considered one of the most complicated peace agreements ever constructed and it consists of several objectives, which aim to uphold a tolerant and democratic constitutional state. There are several paradoxes connected to Annex 7 and the fact that both entities were allowed to have their own constitutions, in which they do not recognise each other constitutional rights, may seem peculiar when they at the same time are supposed to constitute one unity, one country. The federal bodies in the country began to develop before the national bodies were functioning. This has created inconsistencies between the different bodies and between the different legal frameworks and DPA still has a long way to go before being completely implemented. Ethnic nationalist feelings play an important role in political life in BiH and they constitute an effective impediment in the repatriation process. Nationalism has become a common element in the daily life in BiH. Thinking of that the entity constitutions refer to the citizens in the opposite entity as others shows how they perceive each other. After the war each ethnic group seems to concentrate on protecting their own rights, otherwise they will be lost. Citizens in BiH do not have the same constitutional rights in both entities and before this question is solved, a safe minority return is not possible. The functioning of the judicial system is an important factor in the repatriation process. A problem is that the laws are often contradictory or incomplete. This problem is visible on the local level, where politicians often do not know which law to refer to the result is that the local actors do not know how to interpret the laws and then they often do it arbitrarily or they just ignore the laws. The result is often a situation of passing the buck and the citizen stands powerless to the public officials’ demands. This problem is referred to as the state wall of <b>administrative</b> <b>silence</b> and it is a frequent phenomenon at the local level that severely delays the repatriation process. This attitude reciprocity has been common in both municipalities for a long time, as well as in BiH in general, which has resulted in a slow and inefficient repatriation process. Post-war Bosnia and Hercegovina finds itself at a crossroads between an antiquated mechanism that protects state authorities on the one hand, and a modern state institution that serves the citizens and protects their rights on the other. In BiH the new institutions imposed by external powers meet the old institutions, which still are powerful. Those are not synchronised in a way they should, i. e. the old structure or the structure leftover from the collapse of Yugoslavia impedes the new structure rather then collaborating with it. The issue of repatriation has been caught in a structural chaos and BiH has a long way to go before a non-political integration can become a reality...|$|E
