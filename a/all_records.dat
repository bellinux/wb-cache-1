5|$|To {{show off}} their new fighter, the Navy led a series of record-breaking flights early in Phantom development: All in all, the Phantom set 16 world records. Except for Skyburner, <b>all</b> <b>records</b> were {{achieved}} in unmodified production aircraft. Five of the speed records remained unbeaten until the F-15 Eagle appeared in 1975.|$|E
5|$|<b>All</b> <b>records</b> of {{an early}} {{existence}} of Christians in South Canara were lost {{at the time of}} their deportation by Tipu Sultan in 1784. Hence, it is not known exactly when Christianity was introduced in South Canara, although it is possible that Syrian Christians settled in South Canara, just as they did in Kerala, a state south of Canara. The Italian traveller Marco Polo recorded that there were considerable trading activities between the Red Sea and the Canara coast in the 13th century. It can be surmised that foreign Christian merchants were visiting the coastal towns of South Canara during that period for commerce; it is possible some Christian priests might have accompanied them for evangelistic work.|$|E

5|$|As in {{many other}} ISSF events, the target for air pistol was reduced in size in 1989, also {{lowering}} the scores (although not by much), and thereby resetting <b>all</b> <b>records.</b> The development after this shows a contrast to that of air rifle shooting: whereas in air rifle the winning score of the 1989 World Championships would not have reached the final 17 years later, the same result increase has not occurred in air pistol, and Sergei Pyzhianov's world record of 593 points, set in the first World Cup Final with the new targets, remained unbeaten for almost 20 years.|$|E
5|$|Lifting off and {{entering}} orbit, Ross attempts to dock with Phoenix. However, Doppelganger experiences a technical malfunction. The shuttle detaches from Phoenix and falls {{through the atmosphere}} towards the Space Centre. EUROSEC is unable to repair the fault from the ground, and Doppelganger crashes into a parked spacecraft. Ross is incinerated in the collision and a chain reaction destroys much of the Space Centre, killing personnel and destroying <b>all</b> <b>records</b> of Ross's presence on the Counter-Earth.|$|E
5|$|No. 33 Squadron was {{immediately}} put on alert. At noon, Pattle {{was ordered to}} fly a fighter patrol over the Rupel Pass, Bulgaria, another Axis partner. Here he had his first encounter with the Luftwaffe. No. 33 Squadron attacked 20 Bf 109s and claimed five without loss. Pattle claimed two victories over Bf 109Es over the Rupel Pass —Oberleutnant Arno Becker was killed and Leutnant Klaus Faber was captured. These successes represented his 26th and 27th aerial victories. Thereafter, details vary as to his score as <b>all</b> <b>records</b> were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{research}} into Pattle's claims {{has shown that}} at least 27 claimed victories can be directly linked to specific Italian and German losses, while only six claims are discounted as no Axis losses are recorded. Other research dedicated {{to the history of}} German bomber units, some of which took part in the air battles against Pattle's unit, have drawn {{attention to the fact that}} 97–98 percent of all German primary records belonging to the Luftwaffe have been lost either through Allied bombing or through Hermann Göring's order to destroy <b>all</b> <b>records</b> in the first week of May 1945. This makes any {{research into}} German losses difficult.|$|E

5|$|Top Hat began filming on April 1, 1935 {{and cost}} $620,000 to make. Shooting ended in June {{and the first}} public previews were held in July. These led to cuts of {{approximately}} ten minutes, mainly in the last portion of the film: the carnival sequence and the gondola parade which had been filmed {{to show off the}} huge set were heavily cut. A further four minutes were cut before its premiere at the Radio City Music Hall, where it broke <b>all</b> <b>records,</b> went on to gross $3 million on its initial release, and became RKO's most profitable film of the 1930s. After Mutiny on the Bounty, it made more money than any other film released in 1935.|$|E
5|$|According to {{an account}} by Claude Hémeré, {{a friend and}} {{librarian}} of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used {{the records of the}} collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet. <b>All</b> <b>records</b> from Saint-Quentin were destroyed in 1669; however the collegiate chapel there was a center of music-making for the entire area, and in addition was an important center of royal patronage. Both Jean Mouton and Loyset Compère were buried there and it is certainly possible that Josquin acquired his later connections with the French royal chapel through early experiences at Saint-Quentin.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} the Allies' {{occupation}} of Japan, special-service officers of the Imperial Japanese Navy destroyed virtually <b>all</b> <b>records,</b> drawings, and photographs of or relating to the Yamato-class battleships, leaving only fragmentary records of the design characteristics and other technical matters. The destruction of these documents was so efficient that until 1948 the only known images of Yamato and Musashi were those taken by United States Navy aircraft involved in the attacks on the two battleships. Although some additional photographs and information, from documents that were not destroyed, have come to light over the years, the loss of the majority of written records for the class has made extensive research into the Yamato class somewhat difficult. Because of the lack of written records, information on the class largely came from interviews of Japanese officers following Japan's surrender.|$|E

5|$|Sheinberg {{also learned}} of a {{licensing}} agreement between Nintendo and Coleco, {{a producer of}} home video game consoles. Sheinberg scheduled a meeting with Coleco president Arnold Greenberg on April 27, 1982, ostensibly to discuss possible investment in Coleco. Instead, Universal admonished Greenberg for copyright infringement and threatened to sue if the ColecoVision shipped with Donkey Kong as planned. The next day, Universal telexed Coleco and Nintendo giving them 48 hours to cease marketing Donkey Kong, to dispose of all Donkey Kong inventory, and to hand over <b>all</b> <b>records</b> of profits made from the game. On May 5, Greenberg agreed to pay Universal royalties of 3% of Donkey Kongs net sale price, amounting to six million units and worth about $4.6 million. A week later, he signed an agreement that stated that Universal would not sue Coleco as long as Coleco paid royalties.|$|E
5|$|The IAAF ratifies {{track and}} field world records if they meet their set criteria. The IAAF first {{published}} a world records list in 1914, initially for men's events only. There were 53 recognised records in running, hurdling and relay, and 12 field records. World records in women's events began in 1936 as more events were gradually added to the list, but significant changes {{were made in the}} late 1970s. First, <b>all</b> <b>records</b> in imperial measurements were abandoned in 1976, with the sole exceptional being the mile run due to the prestige and history of the event. The following year, all world records in sprint events would only be recognised if fully automatic electronic timing was used (as opposed to the traditional hand-timing stopwatch method). In 1981, electronic timing was made compulsory for all world record runs in {{track and field}}, with times being recorded to within one hundredth of a second. Two additional types of world record were introduced in 1987: world records for indoor competitions, and world records for junior athletes under 20 years old.|$|E
5|$|The storm dropped heavy {{rainfall}} while crossing the Lesser Antilles. In Martinique, the highest 24‑hour total was 26.8inches (680mm) in Fourniols, which was twice the average rainfall for August. Additionally, {{the capital city}} of Fort-de-France reported 13.4in (341mm). There, the rainfall broke <b>all</b> <b>records</b> for durations up to 24hours; about 1inch (26mm) fell in 5minutes, and in one hour a station reported 6.02inches (153mm). The rainfall caused flooding and mudslides, as well as rivers exceeding their banks; several bridges collapsed during the storm, and many homes were washed away. During the passage of the storm, sustained winds on the island reached 67mph (108km/h), with gusts reaching 99mph (160km/h) in the Caravelle peninsula. Throughout the country, the storm destroyed 186homes and left 700people homeless. The passage of Dorothy left heavy crop damage on the island, totaling 32millionfrancs (1970FRF, $5.8million 1970USD); a total of 3.75mi² (9.72km²) of banana crop was destroyed, and 2.16mi² (5.6km²) of sugar cane was destroyed. Damage on the island totaled 190millionfrancs (1970FRF, $34million 1970USD).|$|E

5|$|World War I caused {{problems}} for the breed in the United Kingdom, and when {{the war was over}} there were no dogs whose parents had registered pedigrees. The breed restarted with the remaining unregistered dogs, and it is these dogs that formed the modern day breed. The breeders in the 1920s and 1930s developed these dogs into the type of Welsh Springer Spaniel which remains today. The Welsh Springer Spaniel Club (UK) was formed in 1923, registrations slowly increased between the wars but <b>all</b> <b>records</b> held by the breed club were destroyed in an air raid during World War II. Following the two World Wars, it was thought that no Welsh Springers remained in the United States. The breed was reintroduced, and the descendants of those dogs make up the breed today in the United States and Canada. The breed was officially imported into Australia in 1973.|$|E
