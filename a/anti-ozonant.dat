50|$|An antiozonant, {{also known}} as <b>anti-ozonant,</b> is an organic {{compound}} that prevents or retards the degradation of material caused by ozone (ozone cracking). Antiozonants are used as additives to plastics and rubber, especially in tire manufacturing.|$|E
40|$|A {{dose-response}} {{study with}} the <b>anti-ozonant</b> ethylenediurea (EDU) and a near-ambient level of ozone (6 -h mean of 48 nmol mole(- 1) per 6 days each week) was performed in closed chambers on Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv. Lit. Analyses of morpho-functional parameters and biomass measurements were conducted when plants had reached pod maturation (green harvest). The exposure to ozone caused the appearance of extensive symptoms of injury on leaves and their premature abscission; O- 3 affected the production of dry matter significantly (52 and 57 % reductions in the dry weight of pods and of the total above-ground biomass, respectively), caused a decrease of 50 % in the photosynthetic capacity, reduced the chlorophyll a content (36 %) and influenced peroxidase activity. All these effects were limited or avoided by the EDU treatment, The efficacy of this protection was {{directly related to the}} EDU concentration (varying from 60 to 120 mg per plant), being total at the higher level of the <b>anti-ozonant.</b> EDU, even at the highest concentration, never caused evidence of phytotoxicity. Total peroxidase activity and photosynthetic capacity were not influenced by EDU per se but the obtained results showed that EDU allows the plant to avoid the oxidative stress and to maintain an efficient photosynthetic capacity after chronic exposure to ozone...|$|E
40|$|Ethylenediurea (EDU) is an <b>anti-ozonant</b> {{substance}} that {{is recognized as}} a versatile research tool, andã€€recently attracts increasing interest. As many wild plant species are forced into complex responses by tropospheric ozone (O 3), these responses are crucial for the functioning of ecosystems and consequently for the biosphere; thus, countermeasures are required. A plethora of substances have been evaluated as to their effectiveness in protecting plants against O 3. EDU is the most widely-used substance in O 3 research, in order to moderate O 3 effects on plant growth. We present a synoptic table with recent literature on EDU applications to plants as a protectant against O 3. This table summarizes important information on these publications, {{and we hope to}} be usefull to researchers intended to employ EDU in their research with wild plants, but also to researchers working with air pollution control and other scientists...|$|E

25|$|A static {{discharge}} {{in the presence}} of air or oxygen can create ozone. Ozone can degrade rubber parts. Many elastomers are sensitive to ozone cracking. Exposure to ozone creates deep penetrative cracks in critical components like gaskets and O-rings. Fuel lines are also susceptible to the problem unless preventive action is taken. Preventive measures include adding <b>anti-ozonants</b> to the rubber mix, or using an ozone-resistant elastomer. Fires from cracked fuel lines have been a problem on vehicles, especially in the engine compartments where ozone can be produced by electrical equipment.|$|R
50|$|Polymers for example, can be {{attacked}} by aggressive chemicals, and if under load, then cracks will grow by {{the mechanism of}} stress corrosion cracking. Perhaps the oldest known example is the ozone cracking of rubbers, where traces of ozone in the atmosphere attack double bonds in the chains of the materials. Elastomers with double bonds in their chains include natural rubber, nitrile rubber and styrene-butadiene rubber. They are all highly susceptible to ozone attack, and can cause problems like vehicle fires (from rubber fuel lines) and tyre blow-outs. Nowadays, <b>anti-ozonants</b> are widely added to these polymers, so the incidence of cracking has dropped. However, not all safety-critical rubber products are protected, and, since only ppb of ozone will start attack, failures are still occurring.|$|R
40|$|Aromatic amines are {{environmental}} pollutants {{and represent}} {{one of the}} most important classes of industrial and natural chemicals. Some types of complex effluents containing these chemical species, mainly those originated from chemicals plants are not fully efficiently treated by conventional processes. In this work, the use of electrochemical technology through an electrolytic pilot scale flow reactor is considered for treatment of wastewater of a chemical industry manufacturer of antioxidant and <b>anti-ozonant</b> substances used in rubber. Experimental results showed that was possible to remove between 65 % and 95 % of apparent colour and chemical oxygen demand removal between 30 and 90 % in 60 min of treatment, with energy consumption rate from 26 kWh m(- 3) to 31 kWh m(- 3). Absorbance, total organic carbon and toxicity analyses resulted in no formation of toxic by-products. The results suggest that the presented electrochemical process is a suitable method for treating this type of wastewater, mainly when pre-treated by aeration...|$|E
50|$|Cracks can {{be formed}} in many {{different}} elastomers by ozone attack. Tiny traces of the gas in the air will attack double bonds in rubber chains, with Natural rubber, polybutadiene, Styrene-butadiene rubber and NBR being most sensitive to degradation. Ozone cracks form in products under tension, but the critical strain is very small. The cracks are always oriented {{at right angles to}} the strain axis, so will form around the circumference in a rubber tube bent over. Such cracks are dangerous when they occur in fuel pipes because the cracks will grow from the outside exposed surfaces into the bore of the pipe, and fuel leakage and fire may follow. The problem of ozone cracking can be prevented by adding <b>anti-ozonants</b> to the rubber before vulcanization. Ozone cracks were commonly seen in automobile tire sidewalls, but are now seen rarely thanks to these additives. On the other hand, the problem does recur in unprotected products such as rubber tubing and seals.|$|R
