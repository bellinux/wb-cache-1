5|$|Many {{thermoplastics}} {{can also}} be welded using chemical solvents. When placed {{in contact with the}} plastic, the solvent will begin to soften it, bringing the surface into a thick, liquid solution. When two melted surfaces are pressed together, the molecules in the solution mix, joining them as one. Because the solvent can permeate the plastic, the solvent evaporates out through the surface of the plastic, causing the weld to drop out of solution and solidify. A common use for solvent welding is for joining PVC or ABS (<b>acrylonitrile</b> <b>butadiene</b> <b>styrene)</b> pipes during plumbing, or for welding styrene and polystyrene plastics in the construction of models. Solvent welding is especially effective on plastics like PVC which burn at or below their glass transition, but may be ineffective on plastics like Teflon or polyethylene that are resistant to chemical decomposition.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{measurement}} {{data regarding}} the influent and effluent of {{wastewater treatment plant}} (WWTP) provides a general overview, demonstrating an overall performance of WWTP.

Methods: A full-scale evolution of <b>acrylonitrile,</b> <b>butadiene</b> and <b>styrene</b> (ABS) resin manufacturing WWTP was carried out. Data reconciliation technique was employed to fulfil the mass conservation law and also enhance the accuracy of the flow measurements. Daily average values from long-term measurements by the WWTP library along with the results of four sampling runs, were utilized for data reconciliation with further performance evaluation and characterization of WWTP.

40|$|The damping {{properties}} of <b>acrylonitrile</b> <b>butadiene</b> rubber/Norsorex® blends were investigated by dynamic mechanical analysis. The effects of Norsorex on the {{damping properties}} of <b>acrylonitrile</b> <b>butadiene</b> rubber/Norsorex blends were also studied. The {{results showed that}} 30 -phr Norsorex could dramatically improve the damping of 70 -phr <b>acrylonitrile</b> <b>butadiene</b> rubber. Compared with <b>acrylonitrile</b> <b>butadiene</b> rubber, the LA value of <b>acrylonitrile</b> <b>butadiene</b> rubber/Norsorex[*]=[*] 70 / 30 increased to 7. 3 [*]×[*] 108 from 3. 0 [*]×[*] 108 [*]Pa[*]K and the TA value increased from 26. 6 to 28. 4 [*]K. To test the new high-damping-performance blends, shaking table tests on a four-story steel frame with viscoelastic damping wall were designed and the simulations were provided for verification. The experimental {{results indicated that the}} viscoelastic damping wall controlled the inter-story displacement well under apg[*]=[*] 7 [*]m/s 2, which exceeded the specified limit under uncontrolled conditions. The viscoelastic damping wall showed a better control effect on the displacement response than on the acceleration response subjected to El Centro ground motion for the second to fourth stories.

40|$|Two {{flame retarded}} {{plastics}} have been pyrolysed {{in the presence}} of two Zeolite catalysts to remove the organobromine compounds from the derived pyrolysis oil. The flame retarded plastics were, <b>acrylonitrile</b> – <b>butadiene</b> – <b>styrene</b> (ABS) that was flame retarded with tetrabromobisphenol A and high-impact-polystyrene (HIPS) that was flame retarded with decabromodiphenyl ether. The two catalysts investigated were Zeolite ZSM- 5 and Y-Zeolite. Pyrolysis was carried out in a fixed bed reactor at a final pyrolysis temperature of 440 ºC. The pyrolysis gases were passed immediately to a fixed bed of the catalyst bed. It was found that the presence of Zeolite catalysts increased the amount of gaseous hydrocarbons produced during pyrolysis but decreased the amount of pyrolysis oil produced. In addition, significant quantities of coke were formed {{on the surface of the}} catalysts during pyrolysis. The Zeolite catalysts were found to reduce the formation of some valuable pyrolysis products such as styrene and cumene, but other products such as naphthalene were formed instead. The Zeolite catalysts, especially Y-Zeolite, were found to be very effective at removing volatile organobromine compounds. However, they were less effective at removing antimony bromide from the volatile pyrolysis products, although some antimony bromide was found on the surfaces of the spent catalysts...|$|R

25|$|Minifigures {{have also}} {{featured}} unique head sculpts {{that differ from}} the traditional cylindrical shape; the first was Jar Jar Binks, included in a Star Wars set in 1999, followed by Yoda, C-3PO, Harry Potter goblin figures, Kit Fisto, and Plo Koon. Kit Fisto was the first minifigure to not use an <b>acrylonitrile</b> <b>butadiene</b> <b>styrene</b> head. The minifigure used rubber instead. Traditional accessories, such as hats and helmets, cannot be placed on these non-standard heads. Some minifigures, such as Wookiees, Gamorrean Guards and Ewoks use a sandwich board piece which fits over the body. SpongeBob has a sculpted Lego brick head that fits like a standard head, similar to the ghost figures, except that these figures use short or standard legs instead of a brick.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, newer {{materials}} were superseding Bakelite in many areas.

Items such as billiard balls, dominoes and pieces for board games like chess, checkers, and backgammon are constructed of Bakelite for its look, durability, fine polish, weight, and sound.

Experimental results from TGA and XRD showed that both SSS- and SDBS-intercalated LDHs were successfully obtained.
