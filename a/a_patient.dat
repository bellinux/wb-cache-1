5|$|Once <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> is {{enrolled}} in hospice, the hospice becomes the insurance payor for that patient for any hospice-related illnesses. In other words, if <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> is on hospice for end-stage congestive heart failure, the hospice {{is responsible for}} all care related to the heart failure. However, if the patient were to see a podiatrist, this would be billed through their regular insurance.|$|E

50|$|Fundus {{photographs}} are ocular documentation that record {{the appearance of}} <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> retina. The photographs allow the clinician to study <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> retina, detect retinal changes and review <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> retinal findings with a coworker.

50|$|Capnography, {{because it}} {{provides}} a breath by breath measurement of <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> ventilation, can quickly reveal a worsening trend in <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> condition by providing paramedics with an early warning system into <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> respiratory status. Clinical studies are expected into the uses of capnography in asthma, congestive heart failure, diabetes, circulatory shock, pulmonary embolus, acidosis, and other conditions, with potential implications for the prehospital use of capnography.|$|R

5|$|Oliver {{discovers that}} Penny has {{been having a}} {{relationship}} with <b>a</b> <b>patient,</b> Scott (Joshua Bowman), endangering her career. She plans to move to Spain with him and abandon her training, but Oliver convinces Scott to leave without her. Keen to earn praise from his consultants, Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) and Elliot Hope (Paul Bradley), Oliver claims Penny's research as his own, and is awarded her place in an operation. He is promoted to F2 level, and betrays Penny further by revealing her affair with Scott, which results in her failing her cardiothoracic rotation and being moved to the AAU. A rivalry develops between them, but {{they are forced to}} call a truce when a series of pranks endanger <b>a</b> <b>patient.</b>|$|E
5|$|Should <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> be {{transferred}} to an assisted living facility, nursing home, or hospital, the hospice would continue to provide care to the patient which is on par with the services provided under the routine home care benefit. In this way, {{the only difference between}} respite and routine care is that the hospice pays the room and board charges of the facility. Should <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> receive respite in an inpatient hospice unit the care would be similar to what other patients of the hospice unit receive. Respite is provided for a maximum of five days every benefit period.|$|E

40|$|<b>A</b> {{subset of}} <b>patients</b> with common {{variable}} immunodeficiency (CVID), group 1 a of the Freiburg classification, {{is characterized by}} increased B cells expressing low levels of CD 21 (CD 21 (low)), lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity. The CD 21 (low) B cells {{have been shown to}} be profoundly anergic, and defects of BCR-mediated calcium signaling and of T cells have been described in CVID 1 a. We found that also the classical naive B cells from CVID 1 <b>a</b> <b>patients,</b> but not from CVID non- 1 <b>a</b> <b>patients,</b> proliferated poorly. The B cells of CVID 1 <b>a</b> <b>patients</b> had <b>a</b> reduced capacity to divide reminiscent of the proliferative arrest associated with replicative senescence. Thus, we investigated whether lymphocyte dysfunction in CVID 1 a was related to telomere-dependent replicative senescence, and found that both the B and the T cells from CVID 1 <b>a</b> <b>patients</b> had significantly shorter telomeres compared with B and T cells from CVID non- 1 <b>a</b> <b>patients.</b> Telomere lengths in B and T cells were significantly correlated, indicating that the rate of telomere attrition in lymphocytes is an individual characteristic of CVID patients. Our findings suggest that telomere-dependent replicative senescence contributes to the immune dysfunction of CVID 1 <b>a</b> <b>patients,</b> and may provide an important clue for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of CVID...|$|R

In this paper, we present two dynamic cardiac risk estimation models, focusing on different temporal signatures in <b>a</b> <b>patient’s</b> risk trajectory. These models can track <b>a</b> <b>patient’s</b> risk trajectory in real time, allow interpretability and predictability of a cardiac arrest event, provide an intuitive visualization to medical professionals, offer a personalized dynamic hazard function, and estimate the risk for <b>a</b> new <b>patient.</b> ...|$|R
