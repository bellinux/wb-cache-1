40|$|<b>A</b> <b>turning</b> <b>points</b> {{analysis}} {{is used to}} capture the negotiating dynamics that occur within {{the structure of the}} GATT and the WTO. Ministerial/Council-level operations and Committee-level operations are distinguished. Within WTO Doha Development Agenda negotiations (2001 –present), we isolate Ministerial/Council-level data and within GATT, we isolate Committee-level data by examining Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights negotiations conducted during the GATT Uruguay round (1985 – 1994) and at the WTO Doha Ministerial (2001). A detailed chronology of each case is compiled, followed by the identification of precipitants, departures and consequences, which are the three parts of <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> <b>points</b> analysis. We conclude that the precipitants that led to negotiation <b>turning</b> <b>points</b> in the Ministerial/Council environment are exclusively internal and generally procedural. The precipitants creating <b>turning</b> <b>points</b> within the Committee environment are generally internal and substantive. These conclusions have implications for our understanding of international environments and their impact on negotiation process. 42 page(s...|$|R
