40|$|ABSTRACT: Plasma <b>arc</b> <b>torches</b> {{are being}} applied today as unique heating tools in {{industrial}} processes. The many benefits of using plasma torches are being demonstrated in different production plants and prototype equipment around the world. And the successful demonstration of this versatile, low-mass, controlled high-enthalpy, selective-atmosphere, heat source is generating new applications. Industry today is benefiting from plasma heating and {{will in the}} future derive more benefits from this proven heating technology. There are {{many different types of}} plasma <b>arc</b> <b>torches</b> available. Single torch power ratings range from 20 kilowatts to 60 megawatts. The plasma heaters at the low and high ends of the power range are employed in the universities and in the national research laboratories for basic scientific studies. The industrial sector, with its emphasis on longevity and economy, has adapted only the plasma heaters in the range from 20 k ~ to 8 mW. The operating life of plasma systems is very important in industry for economic reasons. Industrial processes that use plasma torches must be capable of many hours or weeks of continuous or cumulative operating life, unlike the several minutes of operating life demanded of the 60 -mW plasma heater that is used for re-entry heating simulation at NASA's Ames Research Center in California.

40|$|An {{aerospace}} fluid management technology called ``platelets`` {{has been}} applied to components that are critical to the economic operation of waste management systems. Platelet devices are made by diffusion bonding thin metal plates which have been etched with precise flow passage circuitry to control and meter fluid to desired locations. Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) is a promising waste treatment technology for safe and environmentally acceptable destruction of hazardous wastes. Performance and economics of current SCWO systems are limited by severe salt deposition on and corrosion of the reactor walls.

40|$|Evaporation of hafnium cathode in a {{plasma cutting}} <b>arc</b> <b>torch</b> was {{investigated}} numerically and experimentally {{to assess the}} effects of cathode diameter and operating parameters such as gas pressure, gas flow rate and arc current. A numerical model was developed for arc plasma with consideration of hafnium cathode evaporation.

Simulated results show that the cathode surface temperature decreases at the hafnium cathode centre with increasing gas flow rate and cathode diameter. However, an increase in gas pressure elevates the surface cathode temperature in the radial range of 0. 35 mm. The total amount of mass loss of hafnium cathode evaporation was predicted to be enhanced with increasing gas flow rate, gas pressure and cathode diameter as well.

40|$|Double-arcing is a {{phenomenon}} that occurs when a transferred arc, flowing inside an electrically insulated nozzle, breaks into two separate arcs: one that connects the cathode with the nozzle, and another that connects the nozzle with the anode. Experimental {{evidence suggests that the}} reason for double-arcing is a Townsend like breakdown occurring in the thin space-charge layer, which separates the plasma from the metallic nozzle, due to the high voltage drop across it. Breakdown phenomena in a gas between metallic electrodes have been extensively studied; however the present case involves breakdown of a high-temperature gas between one electrode (the nozzle) and a plasma boundary.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to study the effect of process parameters on the formation of nanostructured silicon carbide films by hypersonic plasma particle deposition (HPPD). In HPPD, vapor phase precursors are injected into a thermal plasma generated by a DC <b>arc</b> <b>torch.</b> The plasma is then quenched by supersonic expansion in a ceramic lined nozzle, resulting in the nucleation and growth of ultrafine particles.

40|$|Abstract—Atmospheric-pressure plasmas {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} {{materials}} processes. Traditional sources include transferred <b>arcs,</b> plasma <b>torches,</b> corona discharges, and dielectric barrier discharges. In <b>arcs</b> and <b>torches,</b> the electron and neutral tem-peratures exceed 3000 C and the densities of charge species range from 1016 – 1019 cm 3. Due to the high gas temperature, these plasmas are used primarily in metallurgy. Corona and di-electric barrier discharges produce nonequilibrium plasmas with gas temperatures between 50 – 400 C and densities of charged species typical of weakly ionized gases. However, since these discharges are nonuniform, their use in materials processing is limited. Recently, an atmospheric-pressure plasma jet has been developed, which exhibits many characteristics of a conventional, low-pressure glow discharge. In the jet, the gas temperature ranges from 25 – 200 C, charged-particle densities are 1011 – 1012 cm 3, and reactive species are present in high concentrations, i. e., 10 – 100 ppm. Since this source may be scaled to treat large areas, it could be used in applications which have been restricted to vacuum.
