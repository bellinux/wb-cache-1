5|$|Nynaeve, {{under the}} {{instruction}} of Cadsuane, locates Tam al'Thor, Rand's father, who meets with Rand {{in an attempt to}} break his emotional isolation. Rand becomes angry when he learns that Tam was sent by Cadsuane, nearly killing his father before fleeing in horror at what he had <b>almost</b> <b>done.</b> Rand Travels to the Seanchan-held city of Ebou Dar, intending to destroy their entire army, but he becomes reluctant to act after seeing how peaceful the city is. Nearly mad with rage and grief, he Travels to the top of Dragonmount, the location where he killed himself in a past life. Angry at the futility of life bound to the Wheel, he uses the Choedan Kal to draw enough power to destroy the world. Lews Therin, a voice in Rand's head from his past life, suggests that by being reborn one has the opportunity to do things right. Agreeing, Rand turns the power of the Choedan Kal against itself, destroying it. Rand is finally able to laugh again.|$|E
5|$|The {{background}} {{to the development}} of the Dorchester Hotel is complicated. Sir Malcolm McAlpine, a partner in the building company, Sir Robert McAlpine & Sons, and Sir Frances Towle, the managing director of Gordon Hotels Ltd., shared a vision of creating the 'perfect hotel': ultramodern and ultra-efficient, with all the conveniences modern technology could supply. The two companies purchased Hertford House in 1929 and quickly demolished it. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) had also shown an interest in purchasing it and had <b>almost</b> <b>done</b> so prior to the McAlpine acquisition, but instead they turned their attention to Foley House. The purchase and destruction of Hertford House was part of significant redevelopment which took place on Park Lane during this period; it followed the gutting of Grosvenor House and the building of the Grosvenor House Hotel, which was completed in 1929.|$|E

When David Geffen stopped by the studio for a preview, he was warned {{that it was a}} work in progress, but it was <b>almost</b> <b>done.</b> That was a mistake, because only a few tracks had been finished, and most of them were in demo phase. He heard enough to tell {{producers}} that it was not good enough; the project was canceled. It would be released years later in 1996, under the title I'm a Rainbow.|$|E

25|$|In {{his effort}} to have Solor killed and have Nikiya for himself, the jealous High Brahmin informs the Rajah that the warrior has already vowed eternal love to Nikiya over a sacred fire. But the High Brahmin’s plan backfires when, rather than {{becoming}} angry with Solor, the Rajah decides that it is Nikiya who must die. Gamzatti, who has eavesdropped on this exchange, summons Nikiya to the palace {{in an attempt to}} bribe the bayadère into giving up her beloved. As their rivalry intensifies, Nikiya picks up a dagger in a fit of rage and attempts to kill Gamzatti, only to be stopped {{in the nick of time}} by Gamzatti’s aya. Nikiya flees in horror at what she has <b>almost</b> <b>done.</b> As did her father, Gamzatti vows that the bayadère must die.|$|E
25|$|According to tradition, Muhammad {{played a}} role in the {{restoration}} of the Kaaba, after parts of it had been destroyed by one of Mecca's frequent flash floods. When the reconstruction was <b>almost</b> <b>done,</b> disagreements arose among the clan leaders as to who would have the honor of lifting the sacred Black Stone into place. The disagreements increased to the point where the clans were about to take up arm against each other, when one of the elders suggested they take the advice of the next person who entered the gates of the Haram. This happened to be Muhammad. He spread out his cloak, put the stone in the middle and had members of the four major clans raise it to its destined position. Then he took it in his own hands and fitted it in its place. The cloak became an important symbol for later poets and writers because of this event and what happened later as described in the Hadith of the Cloak.|$|E
25|$|In July 2014, Microsoft {{announced}} plans to lay off 18,000 employees. Microsoft employed 127,104 people as of June 5, 2014, making this about a 14 percent reduction of its workforce as the biggest Microsoft lay off ever. This included 12,500 professional and factory personnel. Previously, Microsoft has laid off 5,800 jobs in 2009 in line with US financial crisis. In September 2014, Microsoft laid off 2,100 people, including 747 people in the Seattle-Redmond area, where the company is headquartered. The firings came as a second wave of the layoffs that were previously announced. This brings the total number to over 15,000 out of the 18,000 expected cuts. In October 2014, Microsoft revealed that it was <b>almost</b> <b>done</b> with the elimination of 18,000 employees which was its largest ever layoff sweep.

25|$|In May 2011, Azerbaijan had {{discussed}} {{the purchase of}} long-range rockets from two Chinese companies, the minister of the defence industry has said. Other arms deals were signed with Turkey. Turkish Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul and Yaver Jamalov signed a protocol of intent on future joint production of two types of output – 107-mm rockets and the national rifle, possibly the Mehmetçik-1. A protocol of intent was signed the same day with the Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation MKEK on the joint production of 120-mm mortar launchers. This project will come into force {{in a few months}} time. Agreement has also been reached with Turkish company Aselsan on the production of some types of defence output in Azerbaijan, specifically the latest types of weapons' sights. These projects will probably happen in the near future too. Recently, Turkish defense industries secretariat told that an export version of the T-155 Firtina self-propelled howitser is <b>almost</b> <b>done</b> and could start production. T-155 has been powered by a German MTU power pack, which restricts the sale to some countries like Azerbaijan. The Turkish manufacturer MKEK, has announced that they have found an alternate supplier for the power pack where Azerbaijan showed interest to buy the high tech, more capable 155mm 52 caliber from Turkish authorities.|$|E

Director Kim Manners used 360-degree shots and close-ups to make the sequence exciting. In the scene following the exorcism, in which Bobby is bent over a dying Meg, Aycox and Ackles read their lines off-screen so that Beaver's reaction could be shot. However, the two were [...] "so slap-happy" [...] to be <b>almost</b> <b>done</b> that they could not stop laughing; to everyone's surprise, Beaver was able to keep a straight face.

500|$|Game {{director}} Mark Pacini {{stated that}} the biggest concern Retro had during production was the controls, which had [...] "too many functions {{for the amount of}} buttons". Pacini also said the Wii Zapper, a gun shell peripheral, was never considered because it was announced when the game's development was <b>almost</b> <b>done.</b> Retro president Michael Kelbaugh said that the delays for the game's release gave them more time to tune the controller, which took a year. He also stated that while Retro did [...] "a great job on the multiplayer in Metroid Prime 2", focus was centered on the single player portion of the game, which was considered to be [...] "the core strength of the franchise". Art director Todd Keller declared the graphics to be focused in both texture detail and variety, with every single texture being hand-made and trying to [...] "make every room its own custom stage". During development, the Nintendo EAD team involved with Corruption suggested Retro to turn Hypermode into the core of the game, saying it would enhance the tension as it made players powerful but if used excessively would lead to a game over. Retro initially disagreed, saying {{it would be difficult to}} implement the feature without dampening the entertainment value, but after discussion decided to turn Hyper Mode into a regular functionality of the game.|$|E
