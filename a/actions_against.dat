5|$|Graham Cluley, a {{security}} expert for Sophos, argued that Anonymous' <b>actions</b> <b>against</b> child porn websites hosted on a darknet could be counterproductive, commenting that while their intentions may be good, {{the removal of}} illegal websites and sharing networks should be performed by the authorities, rather than Internet vigilantes.|$|E
5|$|Odex's <b>actions</b> <b>against</b> {{file sharing}} were legal <b>actions</b> <b>against</b> Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and their {{subscribers}} in Singapore by Odex, a Singapore-based company that virtually distributes sub-licensed Japanese anime. From early 2007 to January 2008 Odex took action against {{anyone who had}} downloaded anime through BitTorrent for alleged copyright infringement. Odex tracked their IP addresses without their consent and sought subpoenas to compel the ISPs to disclose the personal details of these subscribers. After rulings from the Subordinate Courts, Odex took personal data from affected ISPs and sent letters demanding payment in place of litigation. More {{than a third of}} the individuals contacted by Odex opted to settle out of court for at least S$3,000 (US$2,000) to S$5,000 (US$4,000) each.|$|E

50|$|Burundi - On Monday, December 31, 2007, at 6:30 pm, an <b>Action</b> <b>Against</b> Hunger {{vehicle was}} {{targeted}} by shooters {{in the city}} of Ruygi in the East of Burundi.

Several political decisions were made during the meeting, most notably military <b>actions</b> <b>against</b> Germany.|$|E
5|$|Several {{insurers}} and actuary groups cited uncertainty created by President Trump, specifically non-enforcement {{of the individual}} mandate and not funding cost sharing reduction subsidies, as contributing 20-30 percentage points to premium increases for the 2018 plan year on the ACA exchanges. In other words, absent Trump's <b>actions</b> <b>against</b> the ACA, premium increases would have averaged 10% or less, rather than the estimated 28-40% under the uncertainty his actions created.|$|E

5|$|Several writers omit key {{details of}} the story. According to Pausanias, Tereus was so remorseful for his <b>actions</b> <b>against</b> Philomela and Itys (the nature of the actions is not described) that he kills himself.

5|$|The Singaporean anime {{community}} considered Odex's {{actions to}} be controversial, sudden, and heavy-handed—especially {{when it was}} discovered that the youngest person threatened was nine years old. In response, Odex dropped its pay-or-be-sued letter approach in favour of cease-and-desist emails to downloaders. Odex halted active enforcement after its third subpoena was rejected by the courts and lost a lawsuit when trying to obtain customer data from another ISP. In January 2008, Odex appealed the decision, and the High Court of Singapore ruled that one ISP was required to release data, but only directly to Japanese anime studios. Subsequently, these studios started their own legal <b>actions</b> <b>against</b> Singaporean downloaders. Some observers predicted that the High Court's decision would set a precedent for online privacy in Singapore by making it more difficult for copyright licensees to take legal action against downloading. The case raised issues of individual privacy, intellectual property, and free use of the Internet. Odex's actions attracted widespread criticism in Singapore and international attention and press coverage, which coincided with similar <b>actions</b> <b>against</b> consumer file sharing of music in the United States.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, {{at a party}} meeting, {{it was decided that}} {{administrative}} <b>actions</b> <b>against</b> the writers who openly expressed support of reformation would be taken. Since {{only a small part of}} the union held these beliefs, the remaining members were relied upon to discipline their colleagues. Control over Literární noviny and several other publishing houses was transferred to the Ministry of Culture, and even members of the party who later became major reformers — including Dubček — endorsed these moves.|$|E

However following the publication, the British Government obtained a High Court order to confiscate all proceeds from the book, {{on the grounds that}} the government owned the copyright to anything written by Tomlinson. In September 2008, MI6 ended all legal objection to the publication of The Big Breach, released the proceeds from the publication to Tomlinson, and admitted that the organisation's previous legal <b>actions</b> <b>against</b> him were disproportionate. However, it still refused to reinstate him or compensate him for the loss of his career and pension. Since 2009, Tomlinson can now travel freely to the UK.|$|E
5|$|Although characterised at {{the time}} and since as <b>actions</b> <b>against</b> piracy, this charge has been disputed by historians and archivists in the UAE in particular, notably the current Ruler of Sharjah, HH Dr Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi in his book 'The Myth of Arabian Piracy in the Gulf'. The {{counter-argument}} is that the Al Qasimi, a strong and independent maritime force, were the subject of British aggression in an attempt to stamp its authority - and that of its Omani allies - on trade routes thought of as important to Iraq and India.|$|E
5|$|Amin {{was born}} in either Koboko or Kampala to a Kakwa father and Lugbara mother. In 1946 he joined the King's African Rifles (KAR) of the British Colonial Army.

Following Uganda's independence from the United Kingdom in 1962, Amin remained in the armed forces, rising {{to the position of}} major and being appointed Commander of the Army in 1965. Aware that Ugandan President Milton Obote was planning on arresting him for misappropriating army funds, Amin launched a 1971 military coup and declared himself President.|$|E

On January 15, 2008, the gossip blog Gawker posted a video in which celebrity Scientologist Tom Cruise praised the religion; and the Church responded with a cease-and-desist letter for violation of copyright. 4chan users organized a raid against the Church in retaliation, prank-calling its hotline, sending black faxes designed to waste ink cartridges, and launching DDoS attacks against its websites.|$|E
5|$|Another factor behind Echmarcach's <b>actions</b> <b>against</b> Sitriuc could concern Knútr. Echmarcach's {{seizure of}} Dublin {{occurred}} {{only a year}} after the latter's death in 1035. There appears to be numismatic evidence, annalistic evidence, and charter evidence indicating that Knútr and Sitriuc had cooperated together in terms of trade and military operations in Wales. In contrast to this apparent congeniality, the relationship between Knútr and Echmarcach appears to have been less amiable. In fact, it is possible that Echmarcach's meeting with Knútr may have bound him from taking action against Sitriuc, and that the confusion caused by Knútr's demise may have enabled Echmarcach to exploit the situation by seizing control of the Irish Sea region.|$|E
5|$|By 2011, Rowling {{had taken}} more than 50 <b>actions</b> <b>against</b> the press.

In 2007, Rowling's young son, David, assisted by Rowling and her husband, lost a court fight to ban publication of a photograph of him. The photo, taken by a photographer using a long-range lens, was subsequently published in a Sunday Express article featuring Rowling's family life and motherhood.

Other major scenes of fighting occurred at Isqat, Jisr al-Hadid, Kafr Takharim, Darkush, Talkalakh and the areas of al-Qusayr and Antioch. At around the same time, Kurdish tribal forces countered the French at Viranşehir, east of Aleppo, and Bedouin forces commanded by ex-Ottoman officer Ramadan al-Shallash, who declared his support for Hananu, began guerrilla <b>actions</b> <b>against</b> French forces in the general vicinity of Raqqa.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1940, Hitler {{considered}} the possibility of occupying the Portuguese Azores, Cape Verde and Madeira and the Spanish Canary islands to deny the British a staging ground for military <b>actions</b> <b>against</b> Nazi-controlled Europe. In September 1940, Hitler further raised the issue in a discussion with the Spanish Foreign Minister Serrano Súñer, offering now Spain to transfer one of the Canary islands to German usage {{for the price of}} French Morocco. Although Hitler's interest in the Atlantic islands must be understood from a framework imposed by the military situation of 1940, he ultimately had no plans of ever releasing these important naval bases from German control.|$|E
5|$|Elephants can exhibit {{bouts of}} {{aggressive}} behaviour {{and engage in}} destructive <b>actions</b> <b>against</b> humans. In Africa, groups of adolescent elephants damaged homes in villages after cullings in the 1970s and 1980s. Because of the timing, these attacks have been interpreted as vindictive. In parts of India, male elephants regularly enter villages at night, destroying homes and killing people. Elephants killed around 300 people between 2000 and 2004 in Jharkhand while in Assam, 239 people were reportedly killed between 2001 and 2006.|$|E
