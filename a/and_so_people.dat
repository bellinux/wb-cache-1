25|$|In October 1925 he {{was ordained}} Hieromonk and Confessor by Metropolitan John Tsiaparaski of Grouzia Sceta (Georgia), {{and was given}} the new name George.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to cutaneous LP, which is self limited, lichen planus lesions {{in the mouth}} may persist for many years, and tend {{to be difficult to}} treat, with relapses being common. Atrophic/erosive lichen planus is associated with a small risk of cancerous transformation, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>people</b> with OLP tend to be monitored closely over time to detect any potential change early. Sometimes OLP can become secondarily infected with Candida organisms.|$|E
25|$|Social {{motivation}} {{is tied to}} one's activity in a group. It cannot form from a single mind alone. For example, bowling alone is naught but the dull act of throwing a ball into pins, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>people</b> are {{much less likely to}} smile during the activity alone, even upon getting a strike because their satisfaction or dissatisfaction {{does not need to be}} communicated, and so it is internalized. However, when with a group, people are more inclined to smile regardless of their results because it acts as a positive communication that is beneficial for pleasurable interaction and teamwork. Thus the act of bowling becomes a social activity as opposed to a dull action because it becomes an exercise in interaction, competition, team building, and sportsmanship. It is because of this phenomenon that studies have shown that people are more intrigued in performing mundane activities so long as there is company because it provides the opportunity to interact in one way or another, be it for bonding, amusement, collaboration, or alternative perspectives. Examples of activities that may one may not be motivated to do alone but could be done with others for social benefit are things such as throwing and catching a baseball with a friend, making funny faces with children, building a treehouse, and performing a debate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{book also}} advocates a generous welfare state, {{on the grounds}} that people of lower social status are {{unlikely}} to be able to advance very far in life, contrary to the widespread American Dream ideology of [...] "anyone can make it in America if they work hard enough", <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>people's</b> advantages in life come about mostly through accident of birth, not effort.|$|R

2500|$|Demmin's current chronicler, then 14 years old, recalls:My {{mother was}} also raped. And then, {{together}} {{with us and}} with neighbors, she hurried towards the Tollense river, resolutely prepared to jump into it. [...] My siblings [...] realized only much later that I had held her back, that I had pulled her out {{of what may be}} called a state of trance, to prevent her from jumping into the water. There were people. There was screaming. The people were prepared to die. Children were told: 'Do you want to live on? The town is burning. These and those are dead already. No, {{we do not want to}} live any more.' <b>And</b> <b>so,</b> <b>people</b> went mostly into the rivers. [...] That made even the Russians feel creepy. There are examples where Russians, too, tried to pull people out or hinder them. But these hundreds of people, they were unable to withhold. And the population here was extremely panicked.|$|E
2500|$|Numbers 15, 19, 22 and 25 {{were later}} cut, the last {{replaced}} by a waltz song for Sombra, [...] "Here amid the city's clamour". Another edition of the vocal score, also dated 1909 but evidently printed later than that cited above, includes four new numbers: [...] "I'm a case of complete reformation" [...] (Simplicitas and Chorus, Act I, music by Talbot), which was later cut; [...] "The only girl alive" [...] (Jack, Act III) and [...] "Come back to Arcady" [...] (Sombra, Act III), both with music by Talbot; and most notably one of the show's big hit songs, [...] "All down Piccadilly" [...] (Simplicitas and Chorus, Act II), with music by Monckton who also co-wrote the words with Wimperis. Other numbers added during the run were [...] "People often tell us luck and love are jealous" [...] (Jack and Chorus) and [...] "Little George Washington, once on a day, took out his hatchet <b>and,</b> <b>so</b> <b>people</b> say" [...] (Simplicitas, Jack and Bobbie).|$|E
2500|$|As wages {{increase}} {{above the}} subsistence level (discussed below), {{there are two}} considerations affecting a worker's choice of how many hours to work per unit of time (usually day, week, or month). The first is the substitution or incentive effect. With wages rising, the tradeoff between working an additional hour for pay and taking one extra hour of unpaid time changes in favor of working. Thus, more hours of labour-time will be offered at the higher wage than the lower one. The second and countervailing effect is that the hours worked at the old wage rate now all gain more income than before, creating an income effect, which encourages more leisure to be chosen {{because it is more}} affordable. Most economists assume that unpaid time (or [...] "leisure") is a normal good <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>people</b> want more of it as their incomes (or wealth) rise. Since a rising wage rate raises incomes, all else constant, the attraction of unpaid time rises, eventually neutralising the substitution effect and causing the backward bend.|$|E
50|$|According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), 1.00% of {{the total}} {{population}} in UK is homosexual <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> 480,000 <b>people</b> consider themselves gay or lesbian.|$|R

5000|$|Months are {{not equal}} in length, nor {{regularly}} distributed across the year, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> some <b>people</b> rely on mnemonics (e.g., [...] "Thirty days hath September" [...] or knuckle counting) {{to remember the}} lengths of months.|$|R

50|$|The Gulf toadfish is {{commonly}} considered a trash fish. They appear dangerous <b>and</b> slimy <b>so</b> <b>people</b> refrain from eating them.

6000|$|... "No, laddie dear, {{they are}} not queer at all; they are strange and {{beautiful}} thoughts for a little boy to think, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>people</b> who couldn't think anything of the sort themselves, if they tried for a hundred years, think them queer.

60|$|The spire of Shakespeare's church--the Church of the Holy Trinity--begins to {{show itself}} {{among the trees}} at a little {{distance}} from Stratford. Next we see the shabby old dwellings, intermixed with mean-looking houses of modern date; and the streets being quite level, you are struck and surprised by {{nothing so much as}} the tameness of the general scene, as if Shakespeare's genius were vivid enough to have wrought pictorial splendors in the town where he was born. Here and there, however, a queer edifice meets your eye, endowed with the individuality that belongs only to the domestic architecture of times gone by; the house seems to have grown out of some odd quality in its inhabitant, as a sea-shell is moulded from within by the character of its innate; and having been built in a strange fashion, generations ago, it has ever since been growing stranger and quainter, as old humorists are apt to do. Here, too (as so often impressed me in decayed English towns), there appeared to be a greater abundance of aged people wearing small-clothes and leaning on sticks than you could assemble on our side of the water by sounding a trumpet and proclaiming a reward for the most venerable. I tried to account for this phenomenon by several theories: as, for example, that our new towns are unwholesome for age and kill it off unseasonably; or that our old men have a subtile sense of fitness, and die of their own accord rather than live in an unseemly contrast with youth and novelty but the secret may be, after all, that hair-dyes, false teeth, modern arts of dress, and other contrivances of a skin-deep youthfulness, have not crept into these antiquated English towns, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>people</b> grow old without the weary necessity of seeming younger than they are.|$|E
