5|$|Norway has {{a unified}} police, {{which means that}} there is a single police {{organization}} and that police power and prosecutor power is not granted to other agencies within Norway. The sole exception is the military police, albeit which only has jurisdiction over military personnel and on military installations, except during martial law. The police are decentralized and generalized to allow a more flexible resource allocation, while remaining under political control. This entails that police officers have no geographical or sector limitations to their powers. The Police Act and several special laws regulate the agencies and the officer's powers and responsibilities. The police are required to assist other public institutions, including the healthcare authorities, and can be asked by other agencies to assist when it is necessary to enact a decision by force. Conversely, the police can ask for assistance from the Coast Guard when necessary. The police are responsible for <b>all</b> <b>responses</b> against terrorism and sabotage unless Norway is under armed attack.|$|E

The survey also showed that 34.7% of the evacuees have suffered salary cuts of 50% or more since {{the outbreak of the}} nuclear disaster. A total of 36.8% reported a lack of sleep, while 17.9% reported smoking or drinking more than before they evacuated.|$|E

After the confederate was separated from the subject, the confederate set up a tape recorder integrated with the electroshock generator, which played prerecorded sounds for each shock level. After a number of voltage-level increases, the actor started to bang on the wall that separated him from the subject.

25|$|Google Wave {{was a new}} Internet {{communications}} platform. It {{was written}} in Java using OpenJDK and its web interface used the Google Web Toolkit. Google Wave works like previous messaging systems such as email and Usenet, but instead of sending a message along with its entire thread of previous messages, or requiring <b>all</b> <b>responses</b> to be stored in each user's inbox for context, message documents (referred to as waves) that contain complete threads of multimedia messages (blips) are perpetually stored on a central server. Waves are shared with collaborators who can be added or removed from the wave at any point during a wave's existence.|$|E

25|$|When {{the monarchy}} was {{restored}} in 1660, theatres re-opened. Early {{interpretations of the}} play, from the late 17th to early 18th century, typically showed Prince Hamlet as a heroic figure. Critics responded to Hamlet {{in terms of the}} same dichotomy that shaped <b>all</b> <b>responses</b> to Shakespeare during the period. On the one hand, Shakespeare was seen as primitive and untutored, both in comparison to later English dramatists such as Fletcher and especially when measured against the neoclassical ideals of art brought back from France with the Restoration. On the other, Shakespeare remained popular not just with mass audiences but even with the very critics made uncomfortable by his ignorance of Aristotle's unities and decorum.|$|E
25|$|But not <b>all</b> <b>responses</b> were positive. Joseph Stalin {{argued in}} 1924 that Reed was {{misleading}} {{in regards to}} Leon Trotsky. The book portrays Trotsky (head of the Red Army) {{as a man who}} co-led the revolution with Lenin and mentions Stalin only twice—one of them being only in the recitation of a list of names, as both Lenin and Trotsky were internationally known, whereas the activities of other Bolshevik militants were virtually unknown. Russian writer Anatoly Rybakov elaborates on Stalinist Soviet Union’s ban on Ten Days that Shook the World: “The main task was to build a mighty socialist state. For that, mighty power was needed. Stalin was at the head of that power, which mean that he stood at its source with Lenin. Together with Lenin he led the October Revolution. John Reed had presented the history of October differently. That wasn’t the John Reed we needed.” After Stalin’s death, the book was allowed to recirculate.|$|E
500|$|They {{are usually}} not {{produced}} in a natural immune response, but only in diseased states like multiple myeloma, or through specialized laboratory techniques. Because of their specificity, monoclonal antibodies are used in certain applications to quantify or detect the presence of substances (which act as antigen for the monoclonal antibodies), and for targeting individual cells (e.g. cancer cells). [...] Monoclonal antibodies find use in various diagnostic modalities (see: western blot and immunofluorescence) and therapies—particularly of cancer and diseases with autoimmune component. But, since virtually <b>all</b> <b>responses</b> in nature are polyclonal, it makes production of immensely useful monoclonal antibodies less straightforward.|$|E
25|$|Resource {{co-ordination}} organises resources across <b>all</b> <b>response</b> agencies. Agencies inform {{each other}} of their available capabilities and resources so that procurement {{and use of}} resources can be managed efficiently.

500|$|In his Sprawl and Bridge trilogies, Gibson is {{credited}} with {{being one of the}} few observers to explore the portents of the information age for notions of the sociospatial structuring of cities. Not <b>all</b> <b>responses</b> to Gibson's visions have been positive, however; virtual reality pioneer Mark Pesce, though acknowledging their heavy influence on him and that [...] "no other writer had so eloquently and emotionally affected the direction of the hacker community," [...] dismissed them as [...] "adolescent fantasies of violence and disembodiment." [...] In Pattern Recognition, the plot revolves around snippets of film footage posted anonymously to various locations on the Internet. Characters in the novel speculate about the filmmaker's identity, motives, methods and inspirations on several websites, anticipating the 2006 lonelygirl15 internet phenomenon. However, Gibson later disputed the notion that the creators of lonelygirl15 drew influence from him. Another phenomenon anticipated by Gibson is the rise of reality television, for example in Virtual Light, which featured a satirical extrapolated version of COPS.|$|E
