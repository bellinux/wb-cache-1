5|$|In 1979, Davies {{completed}} his O-Levels and stayed at Olchfa with the ambition to study English literature at the University of Oxford; he abandoned his aspirations {{of becoming a}} comic artist after a careers advisor convinced him that his colour-blindness would make that path unlikely. During his studies, he participated in the WGYTC's assignments to create Welsh-language drama to be performed at the National Eisteddfod of Wales, including Pair Dadeni, a play based on the Mabinogion myth cycle, and Perthyn, a drama <b>about</b> <b>community</b> belonging and identity in early-1980s West Glamorgan. In 1981, he was accepted by Worcester College, Oxford to study English literature. At Oxford, he realised that he was enamoured with the narrative aspect of fiction, especially 19th-century literature such as Charles Dickens.|$|E

Adults often talk <b>about</b> <b>communities.</b> Many people, including those in government who make decisions about our country and our lives, say it is important to have ‘strong communities’.

500|$|Chapter four, [...] "A Circle {{within a}} Circle: The Neo-Pagan Community", {{looks at the}} wider {{community}} beyond the coven structure, interpreting it through theoretical ideas <b>about</b> <b>community</b> in late modernity. Moving on, Berger looks at ideas of community memory and community building amongst U.S. Pagans, before examining {{the manner in which}} some Pagans engage in both emancipatory politics and life politics. The fifth chapter, entitled [...] "The Next Generation", is devoted to the place of children within the Pagan community, and deals with ideas of rites of passage, attitudes towards children's sexuality {{and the extent to which}} children are involved in rituals.|$|E
500|$|Several James Turner Street {{residents}} have claimed they were tricked into {{appearing in the}} series by Love Productions, who they say told them it would be <b>about</b> <b>community</b> spirit. One resident told the Birmingham Mail, [...] "They {{told me it was}} about living as a community and how we all got along. But the actual programme doesn't show any of that. If they had said it was about benefits and making the street look bad I would not have taken part. They tricked us." [...] Responding to allegations the residents were duped, Nick Mirsky said that Love Productions had spent much time consulting the residents before filming began, and that process continued afterwards: [...] "Key contributors have been offered viewings of the programmes during the editing period and were given the opportunity to comment on them. Both Love and Channel 4 listened to any concerns raised, and in some cases made changes to the programme to accommodate them." [...] Dierdre Kelly, however, subsequently told ITV's This Morning that she believed the programme had provided a one-sided view of her community, and that the residents [...] "went into the show naively". Gareth Price of The Guardian suggested the show's producers [...] "adeptly edited their film in order to provoke a response from its intended audience".|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Previous {{models of}} {{communities}} and their history {{have focused on}} the entities in those communities such as their locations and people. We introduce models which incorporate behaviors and processes. We propose that approaches based on object-oriented modeling are particularly useful. Specifically, we explore the feasibility of developing object-oriented models which employ linguistic frames adapted from the FrameNet corpus. We apply these models to relatively straightforward and self-contained historical scenarios. We implement the models in Java and analyze some of advantages and challenges in that approach. Historical newspapers are particularly rich sources of natural language descriptions <b>about</b> <b>communities</b> but there are many sources of non-linguistic information <b>about</b> <b>communities</b> which may also be incorporated. We consider the possibilities of developing more coherent models of communities based on modeling processes, partonomies, systems, and situations. Finally, we consider enabling greater interactivity with the structured models and alternative architectures for the models...|$|R
