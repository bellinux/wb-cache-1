She returned to stripping {{in the small town}} of McMinnville, Oregon, where she was recognized by customers at the bar. This prompted Love to go into isolation, so she relocated to Anchorage, Alaska, where she lived for three months to [...] "gather her thoughts," [...] supporting herself by working at a strip club frequented by local fishermen. [...] "I decided to move to Alaska because I needed to get my shit together and learn how to work", she said in retrospect. [...] "So I went on this sort of vision quest.

500|$|Former {{executives}} at Sega have mixed {{opinions of the}} 32X. [...] Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves {{as a warning to}} the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the Kinect and PlayStation Move for doing so. [...] Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, [...] "The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on. [...] An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device." [...] Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, [...] "I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a whole bunch of reasons why we couldn’t ultimately do what we had to do with that platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, but I still think the project was a success for <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> reasons. In hindsight, it was not a great idea for a whole bunch of other reasons." ...|$|E
500|$|Produced by Madlib, [...] "The Healer" [...] is an ode to hip hop {{culture and}} a {{proclamation}} of its scope. It {{opens with a}} brief snippet from a song by Malcolm McLaren featuring the World's Famous Supreme Team. Frere-Jones notes [...] "bells, unidentifiable knocks, a lonesome instrument {{that might be a}} sitar, or a guitar, and lots of empty space" [...] in the musical backdrop, adding that [...] "the music flirts with total stasis, though it still has an audible beat." [...] Badu's lyrics, delivered in an incantation style, make reference to various names of God, including Allah, Jehovah, Yahweh, Jah, and Rastafari, while asserting hip hop to be [...] "bigger than" [...] social institutions such as religion and government. She explained the lyrics and religious references, saying [...] "to me, hip-hop is felt in all religions - it has a healing power. I've recently been to Palestine, Jerusalem, Africa and <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> places, and everyone is listening to hip-hop. There's something about that kicking snare sound that all kinds of people find meaning in." [...] The autobiographical song [...] "Me" [...] discusses Badu's thoughts and feelings about her life, including the struggle of growing as a public figure. She mocks others' perception of her, which she has explained as [...] "everything you can see of Erykah Badu — the Ankhs, the powers, the 5 Percenters, the mysteries, it’s all true. The lies; it’s all true. Had two babies with different daddies. Thirty-six years old and addicted to a variety of spending." [...] The song's jazz conclusion has Badu singing about her mother's life and resilience in unison with a muted trumpet.|$|E

2500|$|When Riddle {{learned of}} Ronstadt's {{desire to learn}} more about {{traditional}} pop music and agreed to record with her, he insisted on a whole album or nothing.

You can't put something like that in the middle of <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> things. The mood comes and then it changes. It's like putting a picture in a bad frame." [...] Riddle was at first skeptical of Ronstadt's proposed project, but once he agreed, his career turned upside down immediately. [...] For her to do [...] "elevator music", as she called it, was a great surprise to the young audience. Joe Smith, the president of Elektra, was terrified that the albums would turn off the rock audience. The three albums together sold over seven million copies and brought Riddle back to a young audience during the last three years of his life. Arrangements for Linda Ronstadt's What's New (1983) and Lush Life (1984) won Riddle his second and third Grammy Awards.|$|E

I'm not sure where the musicians info above was received from, I'm holding the album (10") as I speak and the musicians listed are Milt Raskin piano, Willie Smith alto, Red Callender bass and Dave Coleman drums. I'm Dave Coleman's son and I have the letter from Norman Granz telling my dad he was putting the album out with a check stub for $60 if I remember correctly. A lot of these tunes were done with lots of musicians, but the ones on the 10 inch album are as I have listed above done in one night.

Crane and Kauffman had {{originally}} written {{the role of}} Monica for comedian Janeane Garofalo, their first choice, because they were attracted to her [...] "edgier and snarkier" [...] voice.

Actress Jami Gertz was also offered the role but declined, while actress Leah Remini auditioned for Monica before ultimately being cast as Carrie Heffernan in the sitcom The King of Queens in 1998; Remini would eventually guest star in an episode of Friends. Before being cast as Monica in Friends, Cox was best known for appearing in singer Bruce Springsteen's [...] "Dancing in the Dark" [...] music video; within the television industry for her recurring role as Lauren Miller, Alex P. Keaton's girlfriend, on the sitcom Family Ties; and Melissa Robinson in the comedy film [...] (1994), opposite Jim Carrey. After guest starring on the sitcom Seinfeld as Meryl, main character Jerry Seinfeld's girlfriend, the producers offered Cox the role of Monica's spoiled best friend Rachel because the actress [...] "had this cheery, upbeat energy", which was significantly different than how they had envisioned Monica at the time. Feeling she was not [...] "quirky" [...] enough to portray Rachel, Cox lobbied in favor of playing Monica instead because she {{was drawn to the}} character's [...] "strong" [...] personality, but the producers feared that she was not [...] "tough" [...] enough for the role, which was offered to actress Jennifer Aniston, alongside whom Cox would eventually co-star. Meanwhile, a close competitor for the role was actress Nancy McKeon; Littlefield recalled having greatly enjoyed both actress' auditions equally, and left the final decision up to Crane and Kauffman.
