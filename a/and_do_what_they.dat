James Kang, marketing director for Warner Music in Asia, noted that Koda's sexy image is popular not only with men but also with women, even [...] "", because she uses her image to [...] "make a feminist statement [...] She's constantly telling women to believe in themselves <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want to do". In 2007, it was proposed that the term [...] "ero-kakkoii" [...] be added to the Japanese Encyclopedia of Contemporary Words.|$|E
500|$|The film's plot survives {{because of}} Universal's {{publication}} of the details in Moving Picture News. The official description is as follows, [...] "Charity, through excessive organization, often defeats its own purpose. William Weldon, a telegraph lineman, {{is the father of}} a large family, and finds it a hard struggle to make ends meet on his small wages. By a fall from a telegraph pole one afternoon he sustains injuries which force a lay-off for several weeks. His family is left destitute and, after a time, seek aid from various charity organizations. In each case the organization promises to make a full investigation <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> can, but by the time all the red tape and rules are complied with, the family would starve. In the meantime, Marx, a gentleman thief who has a secret retreat in the same building in which the Weldon family live, meets the invalid daughter, Alice Weldon. She tells him of the family's condition and Marx endeavors to aid her, although at the time he is out of ready cash himself. Taking desperate measures, he holds up a doctor and forces him to attend to Weldon. Then, in company with the female leader of the gang, he attends the charity ball. There he makes a haul — plucking jewelry and trinkets from every one with whom he comes in contact. He pawns the stolen articles and uses the money to help the Weldons. After the family has recovered, through Marx's aid, the charity organizations finally send a few dollars and a skimpy supply of food. Marx decides to reform — in fact, his reformation has been intended for some time, and his last [...] "job" [...] was only the outcome of his desire to do a worthy charity. He goes to the police, declares himself, and surrenders. Marx is sentenced, and while sitting in his cell a vision of Alice appeared before him, repaying him for his sacrifice and charity." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Culture {{stories are}} largely about {{problems}} and paradoxes that confront liberal societies. The Culture itself is an [...] "ideal-typical" [...] liberal society; that is, as pure an example {{as one can}} reasonably imagine. It is highly egalitarian; the liberty of the individual is its most important value; and all actions and decisions {{are expected to be}} determined according to a standard of reasonability and sociability inculcated into all people through a progressive system of education. It is a society so beyond material scarcity that for almost all practical purposes its people can have <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want. If they do not like the behavior or opinions of others, they can easily move to a more congenial Culture population centre (or Culture subgroup), and hence there is little need to enforce codes of behavior.|$|E

2500|$|The {{death at}} age 29 from heart failure of former WWE wrestler, Lance Cade, in August 2010 renewed {{controversy}} over WWE. Cade had abused painkillers and steroids {{during his career}} in WWE. When a reporter asked her about Cade, McMahon replied the WWE had no more ability to prevent his death [...] "than a studio could have prevented Heath Ledger's death", and said, [...] "who knows what causes people to have addictions <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> do?" [...] She also told the Connecticut Post [...] "I may have met him once". Cade's father disputed McMahon's assertion of so distant a connection, and her remarks prompted former WWE wrestler Christopher Nowinski {{to speak out against}} McMahon and the WWE. He alleged that the abuse of steroids and painkillers was encouraged and rewarded by the company, saying McMahon was [...] "just kicking dirt on the guy's grave." [...] He also related a conversation he'd had with Cade in which Cade expressed a desire to stop using steroids, but said, [...] "the pressure is to use them, because the WWE rewards the guys who use them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The protagonist, Bruce Delamitiri, is {{an artist}} {{who works in the}} motion picture industry. Many people in the US think that, by making these movies, Bruce makes killing cool. Numerous {{characters}} throughout the book imply that he encourages everyone who's watching these movies to kill for fun. Bruce, on the other hand, defends himself by telling everyone that he doesn’t think he encourages anyone to do anything. He says that there has always been violence but humans are not like robots, seeing something on the screen does not necessarily make us want to do it ourselves( [...] p.13 [...] "people get up from the movie theatre or the TV <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> just saw"). He also claims that he is just showing existing violence. Unfortunately for Bruce, Wayne and Scout (a pair of psychopaths known in the media as the [...] "Mall Murderers") have formulated a plan to hold him hostage and have him publicly announce that his movies are responsible for their crimes so they can avoid the death penalty (Wayne has a lengthy speech giving examples of how in America it is possible to be guilty and innocent at the same time.) As the novel progresses, Bruce and a critically injured Brooke Daniels are joined inside his house by his wife and daughter and a TV camera crew. The siege reaches its climax as Wayne holds a ratings monitor and announces on live TV that he will spare the hostages if everyone stops watching the siege in the next few minutes - however, this does not happen and he begins firing as the LAPD begin a frantic attempt to subdue him. Many of the characters die in the ensuing violence and the epilogue of the story reveals grim details as to how all the survivors have found a way of escaping responsibility for the tragedy using varying routes from lawsuits and finding religion to making documentaries which explicitly blame everyone else. The book ends with the line [...] "No one has taken responsibility" [...] — echoing an earlier rant by Bruce that we have created a blame free society in which any problem or shortcoming can be blamed on others rather than accepting responsibility for our own actions.|$|E

60|$|The laws of England and America do take it away, do select but one class, {{the people}} who create the {{literature}} of the land.
