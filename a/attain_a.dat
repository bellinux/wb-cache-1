5|$|BLEU’s {{output is}} always a number between 0 and 1. This value {{indicates}} how similar the candidate text is to the reference texts, with values closer to 1 representing more similar texts. Few human translations will <b>attain</b> <b>a</b> score of 1, since this would indicate that the candidate is identical {{to one of the}} reference translations. For this reason, {{it is not necessary to}} <b>attain</b> <b>a</b> score of 1. Because there are more opportunities to match, adding additional reference translations will increase the BLEU score.|$|E

An additional player may play during battle scenarios, with control of individual characters assigned from the configuration menu.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his success}} as a producer, West's true {{aspiration}} {{was to be a}} rapper.

5|$|Other critics even {{in later}} years insisted that the {{character}} of Shylock is that of an outsider separated from society, that the Jewish Shylock represented an older form of justice, meant to be supplanted by the Christian view, represented by Portia, who argued for the prevalence of mercy.

5|$|Due to its {{distance}} {{away from any}} major land masses, Carrie caused relatively minor damage along its path. On September16, the hurricane passed well north of Bermuda, causing minimal damage despite its intensity at the time, though hurricane reconnaissance flights in the area were postponed due to damage sustained {{by one of the}} aircraft. As it was transitioning to an extratropical cyclone southwest of the Azores, the German ship Pamir encountered the storm and capsized on September21, resulting in the deaths of 80crew members on board. As an extratropical storm, Carrie brought strong storm surge and heavy rain to the British Isles, which claimed three lives. The hurricane's long duration and path in open water also helped it <b>attain</b> <b>a</b> number of Atlantic hurricane records.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1991 Gulf War and the {{subsequent}} dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United States Navy began to decommission and mothball many of the ships it had brought out of its reserve fleet in the drive to <b>attain</b> <b>a</b> 600-ship Navy.

5|$|In 1953, {{almost half}} of the Tories' {{campaign}} funds were spent in Quebec, a province in which the party won only four of seventy-five seats. After the 1953 election, Tory MP Gordon Churchill studied the Canadian federal elections since Confederation. He concluded that the Progressive Conservatives were ill-advised to continue pouring money into Quebec in an effort to win seats in the province; the Tories could win at least a minority government by maximizing their opportunities in English-speaking Canada, and if the party could also manage to win twenty seats in Quebec, it could <b>attain</b> <b>a</b> majority. Churchill's conclusions were ignored by most leading Tories—except Diefenbaker.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Fefa was {{forecast}} {{to intensify}} slightly after reaching hurricane status to reach peak winds of 80mph (130km/h). However, it quickly intensified after a large, ragged eye developed early on August 1.

Based on higher Dvorak numbers, the hurricane could have peaked with winds stronger than 120mph (195km/h). Fefa encountered cooler waters shortly after peaking in intensity, and subsequently began to weaken. The hurricane gradually weakened {{as it turned}} more to the west, a change in motion due to building high pressures to its north, and on August 3 the winds of Fefa dropped to 85mph (135km/h) due to cooler water and dry air.|$|E
