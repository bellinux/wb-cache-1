5|$|Elemental iodine is also <b>a</b> <b>skin</b> irritant, {{and direct}} contact with skin can cause damage and solid iodine {{crystals}} should be handled with care. Solutions with high elemental iodine concentration, such as tincture of iodine and Lugol's solution, are capable of causing tissue damage if used in prolonged cleaning or antisepsis; similarly, liquid Povidone-iodine (Betadine) trapped against the skin resulted in chemical burns in some reported cases.|$|E

5|$|Inspired by {{the skyline}} of the Colosseum in Rome, the roofs have <b>a</b> <b>skin</b> {{suspended}} from two masts. The buildings {{were inspired by}} Le Corbusier's Philips Pavilion designed for Brussel's World Fair and the Ingalls Rink Yale University's hockey stadium by Eero Saarinen (both structures completed in 1958). The roof of the Philips pavilion was created by complex hyperbolic paraboloid surfaces stretched between cables. In both cases Tange took Western ideas and adapted them to meet Japanese requirements.|$|E

5|$|The parsnip {{is usually}} cooked, {{but can also}} be eaten raw. It is high in {{vitamins}} and minerals, especially potassium. It also contains antioxidants and both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber. It can be cultivated in deep, stone-free soils. It is attacked by the carrot fly and other insect pests, viruses, and fungal diseases, of which canker is the most serious. Handling the stems and foliage can cause <b>a</b> <b>skin</b> rash if the skin is exposed to sunlight after handling.|$|E
50|$|The African golden cat {{is placed}} in the {{subfamily}} Felinae and the family Felidae.

Subsequently, <b>a</b> brownish grey <b>skin</b> from Sierra Leone was described as F. neglecta, <b>a</b> chestnut <b>skin</b> as F. rutilus, <b>a</b> dark grey <b>skin</b> as F. chrysothrix cottoni, and <b>a</b> black <b>skin</b> from Congo-Brazzaville as F. maka.|$|R

On February 18, 2011, before the game's release, Special Edition and Hero Edition versions of Infamous 2 were announced for pre-order. The Special Edition included <b>an</b> Original Cole <b>skin,</b> <b>a</b> Golden Amp <b>skin,</b> and the Electrocution Grenade power. The Hero Edition included everything from the Special Edition but also included: a Cole MacGrath statue, a sportable sling pack modeled after Cole’s, <b>a</b> Kessler <b>skin,</b> the Lightning Hook power, <b>a</b> Reaper <b>skin,</b> <b>a</b> Sly Cooper's cane <b>skin,</b> <b>a</b> samurai sword <b>skin,</b> <b>a</b> caveman club <b>skin,</b> the Infamous #1 comic, and Infamous 2 The Red Soundtrack.

5|$|The ringed caecilian (Siphonops annulatus) has {{developed}} a unique adaptation {{for the purposes of}} reproduction. The progeny feed on <b>a</b> <b>skin</b> layer that is specially developed by the adult in a phenomenon known as maternal dermatophagy. The brood feed as a batch for about seven minutes at intervals of approximately three days which gives the skin an opportunity to regenerate. Meanwhile, they have been observed to ingest fluid exuded from the maternal cloaca.|$|E

5|$|A few sheep {{conditions}} are transmissible to humans. Orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is <b>a</b> <b>skin</b> disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores {{can be transmitted}} in unwashed wool. More seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are the prion disease scrapie and {{the virus that causes}} foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.|$|E

In Florence, one of said cities, Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi is investigating the disappearance of a library curator. Pazzi questions Lecter, who is masquerading as Dr. Fell, the assistant curator and caretaker.|$|E
5|$|Another 2016 {{study used}} laser-stimulated {{fluorescence}} imaging {{to analyze the}} internal structure of the bristles. The highly cornified bristles are arranged in tight clusters of three to six individual bristles, with each bristle being filled with pulp. The authors considered the bristles as being homologous to the quills of Tianyulong, the elongated broad filamentous feathers (EBFFs) of Beipiaosaurus, and possibly the feathers of birds as well. Similar bristles are found in extant birds such as the horned screamer; these structures differ from feathers in {{that they do not}} develop from a follicle, but both arise from discrete cell populations. A darkened soft-tissue structure was also found near the jugal horn; this may represent a keratinous sheath or <b>a</b> <b>skin</b> flap.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1840s, European {{settlers}} cleared vast {{tracts of}} land for farming and grazing, further reducing kakapo habitat. They brought more dogs and other mammalian predators, including domestic cats, black rats and stoats. Europeans knew little of the kakapo until George Gray of the British Museum described it from <b>a</b> <b>skin</b> in 1845. As the Māori had done, early European explorers and their dogs ate kakapo. In the late 19th century, the kakapo became well known as a scientific curiosity, and thousands were captured or killed for zoos, museums and collectors. Most captured specimens died within months. From at least the 1870s, collectors knew the kakapo population was declining; their prime concern was to collect {{as many as possible}} before the bird became extinct.|$|E

5|$|Crested newts {{are dark}} brown, with black {{spots on the}} sides, and white {{stippling}} in some species. Their belly is yellow to orange with black blotches, forming a pattern characteristic for individuals. Females and juveniles of some species have a yellow line running down their back and tail. During breeding phase, crested newts change in appearance, most markedly the males. These develop <b>a</b> <b>skin</b> seam running along their back and tail; this crest is the namesake feature of the crested newts and can be up to 1.5cm high and very jagged in the northern crested newt. Another feature of males at breeding time is a silvery-white band {{along the sides of}} the tail.|$|E
5|$|Her name {{given at}} birth was Yalurrngali: Peggy Rockman was a name {{subsequently}} {{given to her}} by white administrators.

These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and {{may be associated with}} particular totems. Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans. Thus 'Peggy Rockman' is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers.|$|E

5|$|In 1898, the British naturalist Henry Ogg Forbes {{described}} a second species of Necropsar, N. leguati, based on <b>a</b> <b>skin</b> in the World Museum Liverpool, specimen D.1792, which was labelled as coming from Madagascar. He {{suggested that this}} was actually the bird mentioned by Tafforet, instead of N. rodericanus from mainland Rodrigues. Walter Rothschild, however, believed the Liverpool specimen to be an albinistic specimen of a Necropsar species supposedly from Mauritius. In 1953, Japanese writer Masauji Hachisuka suggested that N. leguati was distinct enough to warrant its own genus, Orphanopsar. In a 2005 DNA analysis, the specimen was eventually identified as an albinistic specimen of the grey trembler (Cinclocerthia gutturalis) from Martinique.|$|E
5|$|In July 1977, Marley {{was found}} to have a type of {{malignant}} melanoma under the nail of a toe. Contrary to urban legend, this lesion was not primarily caused by an injury during a football match that year, but was instead a symptom of the already-existing cancer. Marley turned down his doctors' advice to have his toe amputated (which would have hindered his performing career), citing his religious beliefs, and instead the nail and nail bed were removed and <b>a</b> <b>skin</b> graft taken from his thigh to cover the area. Despite his illness, he continued touring and {{was in the process of}} scheduling a world tour in 1980.|$|E

The film was shelved at the {{outbreak}} of the Croatian War of Independence, and was not released until 1997. Pitt made two motion picture appearances in 1989: the first in a supporting role in the comedy Happy Together; the second a featured role in the horror film Cutting Class, the first of Pitt's films to reach theaters.
