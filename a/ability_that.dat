5|$|In 1831, Wagner {{enrolled}} at the Leipzig University, where he {{became a member of}} the Saxon student fraternity. He took composition lessons with the Thomaskantor Theodor Weinlig. Weinlig was so impressed with Wagner's musical <b>ability</b> <b>that</b> he refused any payment for his lessons. He arranged for his pupil's Piano Sonata in B-flat major (which was consequently dedicated to him) to be published as Wagner's Op. 1. A year later, Wagner composed his Symphony in C major, a Beethovenesque work performed in Prague in 1832 and at the Leipzig Gewandhaus in 1833. He then began to work on an opera, Die Hochzeit (The Wedding), which he never completed.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to gaining levels, Guardian Forces earn Ability Points (AP) after battles, which are automatically allocated to special abilities that Guardian Forces can learn. When a Guardian Force has learned an <b>ability,</b> <b>that</b> ability becomes available for any character or the character party, {{as is the}} case with field abilities. These abilities allow characters to attack more efficiently, refine magic spells from items, receive stat bonuses upon leveling up, access shops remotely and use additional battle commands.|$|E

5|$|In {{intelligent}} mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum {{is larger}} {{relative to the}} rest of the brain. Intelligence itself is not easy to define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioral flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered to be highly intelligent, as they can learn and perform new tasks, an <b>ability</b> <b>that</b> may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat. In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat, which must think to outwit its prey.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} year he became Home Secretary in India {{in the administration of}} Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India, and in 1909 was temporarily a member of the governing council. His experience of administrative matters, including with regard to policing, proved to be useful to Curzon during the government's 1905 partition of Bengal along communal lines. So useful was his knowledge and <b>ability</b> <b>that</b> his term in India was extended for two years beyond the usual retirement age. This was to enable him to provide the summarisation, negotiation and drafting skills necessary to ensure success in administrative reform of the Provincial Councils by Curzon's successor as Viceroy, Lord Minto.|$|E
5|$|Players {{navigate}} the knight {{to collide with}} enemies. The elevation of an enemy {{in relation to the}} player's knight determines the outcome of the collision. If the protagonist is higher than the enemy, the villain is defeated and vice versa. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other. Joust 2 introduced a transformation <b>ability</b> <b>that</b> morphs the player's bird into a pegasus, which provides better offensive capabilities while on ground but poor flight capabilities. A second player can join the game. The two players can either cooperatively complete the waves or attack each other while competitively defeating enemies.|$|E
25|$|No {{specific}} actions {{take place at}} the beginning of combat step. This step mainly exists to allow players to cast spells and activate <b>abilities</b> <b>that</b> may alter how combat progresses. As the most common example, only untapped creatures may attack, so the defending player may cast instants or activate <b>abilities</b> <b>that</b> will tap a creature, preventing it from attacking.|$|R

5|$|We played Birmingham City in {{pre-season}} {{and he got}} {{a lovely}} ovation from their supporters and it was the same at Yeovil last year. He got a lovely clap at Northampton a few weeks ago when he was taken off. I don't think that happened by coincidence. And I've got a feeling that if he leaves Cheltenham he will get a similar reception if he comes back with another club. Supporters recognise him and they see the whole-heartedness and the commitment and the <b>ability</b> <b>that</b> he has got.|$|E
5|$|Wesley awakens in {{a factory}} {{surrounded}} by Fox and other assassins. The group's leader, Sloan, forces Wesley at gunpoint to shoot the wings off of several flies, which he does, much to Wesley's shock. Sloan explains that Wesley's panic attacks are actually a rare <b>ability</b> <b>that</b> allows him to distribute massive amounts of adrenaline to his brain,slowing his perception of his surroundings and granting him superhuman strength and speed. He reveals that Wesley's father, as well as Cross, {{were members of the}} Fraternity, a society of assassins that maintains balance in the world. Sloan wants to train him so that he may help kill Cross.|$|E
5|$|A mysterious {{recruiter}} approaches Wilson, {{offering an}} experimental cure for his cancer. He {{is taken to}} Ajax and Angel Dust, who inject him with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes. They then subject him to days of torture to induce stress to trigger any mutation Wade may have, but without success. Wilson discovers Ajax's real name, Francis, and mocks him for it. In response, Ajax leaves Wilson in a hyperbaric chamber that takes him to the verge of asphyxiation periodically over a weekend. It finally activates a superhuman healing <b>ability</b> <b>that</b> cures his cancer, but leaves him severely disfigured with burn-like scars over his entire body. He escapes from the chamber and attacks Ajax, but relents when told that his disfigurement can be cured. Ajax subdues Wilson and leaves him for dead in the burning laboratory.|$|E

5|$|Clyde began 1974 {{season with}} a 3–0 record, but became embroiled in {{controversy}} following a dispute between new manager Billy Martin and general manager Bobby Brown. Martin and Brown argued about what {{was the best way}} on handling Clyde's future development, which led to Brown's resignation and caused Clyde to miss a month before remaining on the Rangers roster {{for the rest of the}} year. He played in 28 games (21 starts) and finished with 3–9 record, and a 4.38 ERA. He started one game in 1975 (a loss) before injuring his shoulder and was demoted to the Pittsfield Rangers of the Eastern League. He stayed in the minors for three seasons, having a shoulder operation in 1976. The Rangers organization lost so much faith in Clyde's <b>ability</b> <b>that</b> he was left unprotected in the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft, but was not chosen. He played for the Sacramento Solons in 1976, and the Tucson Toros of the Pacific Coast League in 1977 where he had 5–7 record with a 5.84 ERA. When the season ended, the Rangers traded Clyde and veteran Willie Horton to the Cleveland Indians for Tom Buskey and John Lowenstein on February 28, 1978.|$|E
5|$|Hunter {{began to}} achieve limited success after {{a trip to}} the Etaples art colony in {{northern}} France in 1914. Here, inspired by French art and the local landscape, he began to develop the style and <b>ability</b> <b>that</b> would later identify him as a colourist. However, the onset of the First World War forced him to return to Scotland, where his work became noticed by Alexander Reid of Reid & Lefevre. In 1915, Hunter held his first one-man exhibition with Reid in Glasgow. Hunter's work at this stage of his career focused primarily on still lifes, inspired by Chardin, Kalf and Manet. During the 1920s, Hunter began to be associated with a group of three other artists: John Duncan Fergusson, F. C. B. Cadell, and Samuel Peploe. The four of them became known as the Scottish Colourists, although the term was not used until 1948, by which time only Fergusson was still alive.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Fringe {{division}} is falsely told that their Olivia has escaped. Agent Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), still needing hyperbaric treatment to regrow his skin after being burned, and Agent Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) follow a tracking device on Henry's taxi. When {{they arrive at}} the station, Olivia orders Henry to drive away, and manages to fire at a small valve on a gas tank, allowing the explosion to cover their trail. Walternate, watching the altercation on monitors, notes Olivia has gained the marksmanship <b>ability</b> <b>that</b> the alternate Olivia possesses, and begins to think the serum is working. Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes in a later conversation that the rush of adrenaline effectively enhanced the potency of his chemical agents to brainwash Olivia.|$|E

5000|$|Players can {{customise}} their loadouts and buy special abilities {{with experience}} points, which are earned by completing objectives. The <b>abilities</b> <b>that</b> the player can buy for their character are either [...] "universal" [...] (<b>abilities</b> <b>that</b> the player {{will be able}} to use regardless of their class during a mission) and class-specific (<b>abilities</b> <b>that</b> the player can use only when they are in that class). All characters in the beginning will have the [...] "basic kits" [...] of each class so that they can perform the essential objectives only. The class-specific <b>abilities</b> <b>that</b> they buy, however, can enhance their ability and their role in a certain class, potentially making objectives easier to complete and allowing for a greater gain in experience points. The same experience points can be earned in both single-player and multiplayer, adding a special [...] "online bonus" [...] to the player's experience points after completing a mission online. Bethesda claims that players can create a total of 102 quadrillion unique character combinations, if minor variations are factored in.|$|R

5|$|Shooting began September 23, 1937 and was {{scheduled}} to end November 20, 1937 on a budget of $767,676. Filming began in-studio with the scenes in Susan's apartment, moving to the Bel Air Country Club in early October for the golf-course scenes. The production had a difficult start due to Hepburn's struggles with her character and her comedic abilities. She frequently overacted, trying too hard to be funny, and Hawks asked vaudeville veteran Walter Catlett to help coach her. Catlett acted out scenes with Grant for Hepburn, showing {{her that he was}} funnier when he was serious. Hepburn understood, acted naturally and played herself {{for the rest of the}} shoot; she was so impressed by Catlett's talent and coaching <b>ability</b> <b>that</b> she insisted he play Constable Slocum in the film.|$|E
5|$|Voss {{was one of}} {{the test}} pilots for the F.I triplane {{prototype}} which developed into the Fokker Dr.I. He was summoned to Schwerin, and on 5 July 1917 {{was one of the}} first pilots to test fly Fokker F.I s/n 103/17. Although the Fokker had some drawbacks, such as its low speed and slowness in a dive, Voss loved the new craft. It was easy to fly with light controls, could out-manoeuvre any previous aircraft, mounted twin machine guns, and had a rapid rate of climb. The same climbing <b>ability</b> <b>that</b> put it at 1,000 meters (3,000 feet) within three minutes of takeoff lent itself to the combat tactic of zooming upwards out of combat to gain the height advantage on opponents. Voss enthusiastically recommended the Fokker's adoption while never progressing to testing the Pfalz Dr.I. He left Schwerin with an assignment for command of another jasta.|$|E
5|$|While {{progressing}} {{through the}} game, the player can {{take control of}} three different characters: Juno, Vela, and Lupus. Each character has a special <b>ability</b> <b>that</b> allows them to uncover areas which the other characters cannot reach. Juno can walk through magma safely, Vela can swim underwater indefinitely, and Lupus can hover {{for a short period}} of time. Therefore, choosing the right character for the right stage is critical in order to complete the game. Initially, the game forces the player to use the three characters individually until they reach a meeting point. Once they reach the meeting point, all of the worlds can be tackled with any character in any order. The overall objective of the game is to explore all the galaxy to collect several starship parts and save a large number of survivors. The player can then use a starship and travel to the final stage.|$|E
