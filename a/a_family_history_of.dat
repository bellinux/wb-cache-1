5|$|Spontaneous pneumothoraces {{are divided}} into two types: primary, which occurs {{in the absence of}} known lung disease, and secondary, which occurs in someone with {{underlying}} lung disease. The cause of primary spontaneous pneumothorax is unknown, but established risk factors include male sex, smoking, and <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> pneumothorax. Smoking either cannabis or tobacco increases the risk. The various suspected underlying mechanisms are discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{investigating}} {{effects of}} the menstrual cycle on alcohol consumption have found mixed evidence.

40|$|Hypertension is {{the most}} common disease and it {{markedly}} increases both morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases. Subjects in the upper-normal range of arterial pressure are considered to have an excess cardiovascular risk and this risk doubles in a near linear fashion for each 20 / 10 mm Hg increment in blood pressure levels above 115 / 75 mm Hg. 50 young normotensives with <b>a</b> positive <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> hypertension and 50 young normotensives with <b>a</b> negative <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> hypertension, matched for age, sex were studied. Baseline blood pressure, heart rate and blood pressure changes post exercise were recorded and compared by Student’s t-test. The young normotensives with <b>a</b> positive <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> hypertension had significantly higher blood pressure (P< 0. 05) and also increased resting heart rate (P< 0. 05) than young normotensives with <b>a</b> negative <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> hypertension. The increased blood pressure and heart rate observed here in the offspring of hypertensive parents emphasizes the importance of genetic influence on hypertension. This blood pressure elevation may be considered as a permanent abnormality characterizing a prehypertensive stage early in life...|$|R

5|$|Research {{on early}} {{detection}} is ongoing.

The knowledge that new onset of diabetes can be an early sign of the disease could facilitate timely diagnosis and prevention if a workable screening strategy can be developed.|$|E

5|$|Women with <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> {{endometrial cancer}} are at higher risk. Two genes most {{commonly}} associated with some other women's cancers, BRCA1 and BRCA2, do not cause endometrial cancer. There is an apparent link with these genes but it is attributable {{to the use of}} tamoxifen, a drug that itself can cause endometrial cancer, in breast and ovarian cancers. The inherited genetic condition Cowden syndrome can also cause endometrial cancer. Women with this disorder have a 5–10%lifetime risk of developing endometrial cancer, compared to the 2–3%risk for unaffected women.|$|E
5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences {{the risk of the}} development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism {{are also more likely to}} begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E
5|$|About 99% of HD diagnoses {{based on}} the typical {{symptoms}} and <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the disease are confirmed by genetic testing to have the expanded trinucleotide repeat that causes HD. Most of the remaining are called HD-like (HDL) syndromes. The cause of most HDL diseases is unknown, but those with known causes are due to mutations in the prion protein gene (HDL1), the junctophilin 3 gene (HDL2), a recessively inherited unknown gene (HDL3—only found in two families and poorly understood), and the gene encoding the TATA box-binding protein (SCA17, sometimes called HDL4). Other autosomal dominant diseases that can be misdiagnosed as HD are dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and neuroferritinopathy. There are also autosomal recessive disorders that resemble sporadic cases of HD. These include chorea acanthocytosis and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. One X-linked disorder of this type is McLeod syndrome.|$|E

5|$|As {{the summit}} closed on 28 September 1970, hours after escorting the last Arab leader to leave, Nasser {{suffered}} a heart attack. He was immediately transported to his house, where his physicians tended to him. Nasser died several hours later, around 6:00p.m. Heikal, Sadat, and Nasser's wife Tahia were at his deathbed. According to his doctor, al-Sawi Habibi, Nasser's likely {{cause of death was}} arteriosclerosis, varicose veins, and complications from long-standing diabetes. Nasser was a heavy smoker with <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> heart disease—two of his brothers died in their fifties from the same condition. The state of Nasser's health was not known to the public prior to his death. He had previously suffered heart attacks in 1966 and September 1969.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy cannot {{usually be}} cured, but {{medication}} can control seizures effectively in about 70% of cases. Of those with generalized seizures, more than 80% can be well controlled with medications {{while this is}} true in only 50% of people with focal seizures. One predictor of long-term outcome {{is the number of}} seizures that occur in the first six months. Other factors increasing the risk of a poor outcome include little response to the initial treatment, generalized seizures, <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> epilepsy, psychiatric problems, and waves on the EEG representing generalized epileptiform activity. In the developing world, 75% of people are either untreated or not appropriately treated. In Africa, 90% do not get treatment. This is partly related to appropriate medications not being available or being too expensive.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{requirement}} that other comorbid conditions (such as ADHD or OCD) be present, {{but if a}} physician believes {{that there may be}} another condition present that could explain tics, tests may be ordered as necessary to rule out that condition. An example of this is when diagnostic confusion between tics and seizure activity exists, which would call for an EEG, or if there are symptoms that indicate an MRI to rule out brain abnormalities. TSH levels can be measured to rule out hypothyroidism, which can be a cause of tics. Brain imaging studies are not usually warranted. In teenagers and adults presenting with a sudden onset of tics and other behavioral symptoms, a urine drug screen for cocaine and stimulants might be necessary. If <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> liver disease is present, serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels can rule out Wilson's disease. Most cases are diagnosed by merely observing a history of tics.|$|E

5|$|The risk of VTE is {{increased}} in pregnancy by {{about five times}} because of a more hypercoagulable state, a likely adaptation against fatal postpartum hemorrhage. Additionally, pregnant women with genetic risk factors are subject to a roughly three to 30 times increased risk for VTE. Preventative treatments for pregnancy-related VTE in hypercoagulable women were suggested by the ACCP. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> VTE were suggested for antepartum LMWH and either LMWH or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for the six weeks following childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia and a family history but no previous VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH or—for those without protein C or S deficiency—a VKA. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with no personal or family history of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH or a VKA for six weeks after childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia but no family or personal history of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting only. Warfarin, a common VKA, can cause harm to the fetus and is not used for VTE prevention during pregnancy.|$|E
