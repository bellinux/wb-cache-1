5|$|Bromine pentafluoride (BrF5) {{was first}} {{synthesised}} in 1930. It is produced on <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> by direct reaction of bromine with excess fluorine at temperatures higher than 150°C, {{and on a}} small scale by the fluorination of potassium bromide at 25°C. It is a very vigorous fluorinating agent, although chlorine trifluoride is still more violent. Bromine pentafluoride explodes on reaction with water and fluorinates silicates at 450°C.|$|E

5|$|In meteorology, a cyclone is <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> {{air mass}} that rotates around a strong center of low {{atmospheric}} pressure. Cyclones {{are characterized by}} inward spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest scale (the synoptic scale). Warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale.|$|E

5|$|Before Spanish {{colonization}} in the 1770s, the San Juan Creek watershed was {{inhabited by}} the Acjachemen or Juañeno Native Americans.

The watershed was used mainly for agriculture and ranching until the 1950s when residential suburban development began on <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>scale.</b> Since then, the human population has continued to encroach on floodplains of local streams.

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, viruses {{were defined}} in terms of their infectivity, their ability to be filtered, and their {{requirement}} for living hosts. Viruses had been grown only in plants and animals. In 1906, Ross Granville Harrison invented a method for growing tissue in lymph, and, in 1913, E. Steinhardt, C. Israeli, and R. A. Lambert used this method to grow vaccinia virus in fragments of guinea pig corneal tissue. In 1928, H. B. Maitland and M. C. Maitland grew vaccinia virus in suspensions of minced hens' kidneys. Their method was not widely adopted until the 1950s, when poliovirus was grown on <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> for vaccine production.|$|E

The increase in demand for one industry will lead to an increase in demand for another industry due to complementarity of demands. As Say's Law states, supply creates its own demand.|$|E

Several {{composite}} bows were found in the tomb of Tutankhamun, who died in 1324 BCE. Composite bows (and chariots) are known in China from at least the Shang Dynasty (1700–1100 BCE). We have strong indications to believe that Bronze Age Greek Cultures like the Minoans and the Mycenaeans were using composite bows in <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>scale.</b> By the 4th century BCE, chariotry had ceased to have military importance, replaced by cavalry everywhere (except in Britannia where charioteers are not recorded as using bows).|$|E

Furthermore, a meta-analysis pooled 40 studies that involved 700 astrologers and over 1,000 birth charts. Ten of the tests—which involved 300 participants—had the astrologers pick the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others that were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation (usually three to five others). When date and other obvious clues were removed, no significant results suggested there was any preferred chart.|$|E
