With {{striking}} colors, elaborate texture, and intricate weave and embroidery, Noh robes <b>are</b> <b>truly</b> works of art in their own right. Costumes for the shite in particular are extravagant, shimmering silk brocades, but are progressively less sumptuous for the tsure, the wakizure, and the aikyōgen.|$|E
5|$|In the Standard Model of physics, {{electrons}} <b>are</b> <b>truly</b> elementary particles with no internal structure. However, both {{protons and}} neutrons are composite particles composed of elementary particles called quarks. There {{are two types}} of quarks in atoms, each having a fractional electric charge. Protons are composed of two up quarks (each with charge +) and one down quark (with a charge of −). Neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks. This distinction accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles.|$|E
50|$|Instruction 3 <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> {{dependent}} on instruction 2, {{as the final}} value of C depends on the instruction updating B. Instruction 2 <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> {{dependent on}} instruction 1, as the final value of B depends on the instruction updating A. Since instruction 3 <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> dependent upon instruction 2 and instruction 2 <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> dependent on instruction 1, instruction 3 <b>is</b> also <b>truly</b> dependent on instruction 1. Instruction level parallelism is therefore not an option in this example.|$|R
60|$|And now, my friends, {{surely there}} is a lesson in all this for you. Do you wish to rise like David? Of course not one in ten {{thousand}} can rise as high, but we may all rise somewhat, if not in rank, yet still, what is far better, in spirit, in wisdom, in usefulness, in manfulness. Do you wish to rise so? then follow David's example. <b>Be</b> <b>truly</b> brave, <b>be</b> <b>truly</b> modest, {{and in order to}} <b>be</b> <b>truly</b> brave and <b>truly</b> modest, that <b>is,</b> <b>be</b> <b>truly</b> manly, <b>be</b> <b>truly</b> godly. Trust in God; trust in God; that is the key to all greatness. Courage, modesty, truth, honesty, and gentleness; all things, which are noble, lovely, and of good report; all things, in short, which will make you men after God's own heart, are all only the different fruits of that one blessed life-giving root--FAITH IN GOD.|$|R

The three share a particular configuration of the arteries in the head known as the derived carotid arterial circulatory pattern, which is unique within the genus Oecomys, and a general similarity in other traits. However, O.sydandersoni differs from the other two in characters of the fur and in metric characters. Whether the three species <b>are</b> <b>truly</b> closely related needs to be determined using molecular data.|$|E

When it appears Kasim may lose, he is saved by Dullah, who had followed him back to Sawoba.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the century, some of {{the most}} widely read Russian {{literary}} figures focused on feminist motifs in their works. In his later years, Leo Tolstoy argued against the traditional institution of marriage, comparing it to forced prostitution and slavery, a theme that he also touched on in his novel Anna Karenina. In his plays and short stories, Anton Chekhov portrayed a variety of working female protagonists, from actresses to governesses, who sacrificed social esteem and affluence for the sake of financial and personal independence; in spite of this sacrifice, these women are among the few Chekhovian characters who <b>are</b> <b>truly</b> satisfied with their lives.|$|E
5|$|Crustaceans have a {{rich and}} {{extensive}} fossil record, which begins with animals such as Canadaspis and Perspicaris from the Middle Cambrian age Burgess Shale. Most of the major groups of crustaceans appear in the fossil record {{before the end of}} the Cambrian, namely the Branchiopoda, Maxillopoda (including barnacles and tongue worms) and Malacostraca; there is some debate as to whether or not Cambrian animals assigned to Ostracoda <b>are</b> <b>truly</b> ostracods, which would otherwise start in the Ordovician. The only classes to appear later are the Cephalocarida, which have no fossil record, and the Remipedia, which were first described from the fossil Tesnusocaris goldichi, but do not appear until the Carboniferous. Most of the early crustaceans are rare, but fossil crustaceans become abundant from the Carboniferous period onwards.|$|E

And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world.

5|$|Other hunting traditions then follow, again {{rooted in}} religion. The warriors of the Kuru tribe in Africa commit a sacred act {{in which they}} copulate with the ground in belief that it will make the Earth fertile and produce animals for the hunt, and a stag hunt in France, rooted in ancient pagan beliefs of the Gauls, is blessed by a mass before the hunt takes place, during which the hunters and dogs chase and {{ultimately}} kill a fleeing stag. In a fox hunt, the Wild Fox Association sabotages the hunting efforts by serving wine laced with a laxative to the hunters and distracting the dogs with an Afghan bitch in heat. Their efforts are then connected to species conservation, and to exemplify that hunters <b>are</b> <b>truly</b> concerned in wildlife conservation, Argentine hunters capture an Andean condor to sell to a zoo. A collage of other conservation efforts is shown, including the tagging of white rhinoceroses, grizzly bears and elephants, which are shot with morphine darts. Argentinian deer and elephant seals are physically subdued and marked. Tourists on Africans safaris then come to view the conservation efforts, which the narrator claims to have seemingly negated the animals' violent instincts. This deception is demonstrated with the mauling of a tourist named Pit Dernitz by lions.|$|E
