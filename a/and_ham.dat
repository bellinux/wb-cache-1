5|$|The Jubilee Plantation, {{created to}} commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria, was {{established}} in 1887.

5|$|In {{consideration}} of {{the expense of a}} film shot in Britain, King initially sought to film in Germany and Eastern Europe. However, he came to the realisation that it was vital The Young Victoria be filmed in its native country for authenticity. Due to the Duchess of York's status and connections with the British royal family, The Young Victoria was able to film in many actual palaces and other landmarks. The film had a ten-week shoot starting in August 2007. Scenes set at Westminster Abbey were filmed at Lincoln Cathedral in September and October, <b>and</b> <b>Ham</b> House was substituted for Kensington Palace. Blenheim Palace, Lancaster House and Ditchley Park doubled for internal scenes of the monarch's main residence, Buckingham Palace. Other scenes filmed at Hampton Court Palace, Arundel Castle in West Sussex, Wilton House near Salisbury, Balls Park and Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire. Week four of shooting was especially intensive, as filming was done at a different site each day, including Osterley Park, Old Royal Naval College, Ham House, Novello Theatre and Hampton Court.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Manne began to compose his own film scores, {{such as that}} for The Proper Time (1959), with the music also played by his own group, Shelly Manne and His Men, and issued on a Contemporary LP. In later years, Manne divided his time playing the drums on, adding special percussive effects to, and {{sometimes}} writing complete scores for both film and television. He even provided a musical setting for a recording of the Dr. Seuss children's classic Green Eggs <b>and</b> <b>Ham</b> (1960) and later performed in and sometimes wrote music for the backgrounds of numerous animated cartoons. For example, he joined other notable jazz musicians (including Ray Brown and Jimmy Rowles) in playing Doug Goodwin's music for the cartoon series The Ant and the Aardvark (19691971). Notable examples of later scores that Manne wrote himself and also performed in are, for the movies, Young Billy Young (1969) and Trader Horn (1973), and, for television, Daktari, 19661969. With these and other contributions to cartoons, children's stories, movies, television programs (and even commercials), Manne's drumming became woven into the popular culture of several decades.|$|E

25|$|Edward Kemp's {{plan was}} for a formal garden {{containing}} a conservatory and plant houses {{to the north of}} the house. Beyond these were a garden yard, a stable yard, a coach house and a farm yard. To the west of these was a substantial kitchen garden. The other outbuildings included a vinery, with a heated wall, and a smoke house for curing bacon <b>and</b> <b>ham.</b> Joseph Stubs was a collector of rare plants and many of these were planted in what he called the American Garden. In the days of the Wright family a head gardener and seven full-time gardeners were employed and also during this time more outbuildings were constructed beyond the coach house.|$|E

25|$|Spain under King Philip II of Spain had intervened {{regularly}} in the Wars of Religion in favour of the Catholic League against the Protestant Huguenots, most notably in the Siege of Paris (1590), the Siege of Rouen (1591), and the Battle of Craon in 1592. However, only in 1595 was war officially declared {{between the two countries}} by the new King Henry IV of France, who had converted to Catholicism and been received into Paris the year before to be crowned with popular support. From then on, the civil war began to turn against the hardliners of the Spanish supported Catholic League, including two major royal French victories over the Spanish at Fonatain-Francais <b>and</b> <b>Ham</b> in 1595. The Spanish responded to the faltering of the League and their own defeats with a great campaign that year and the next, capturing Le Catelet, Doullens, Cambrai, Calais and Ardres.|$|E
