5|$|An <b>active</b> <b>sonar</b> {{system was}} {{scheduled}} to be installed in June 1940, but it is uncertain when it was actually done. During the war, the ship's light anti-aircraft armament was augmented several times. Improved 2cm C/38 guns replaced the original C/30 guns and three additional guns were added sometime in 1941. The two guns on the aft shelter deck were replaced by a single 2cm quadruple Flakvierling mount, probably during her late 1941 refit. Richard Beitzen appears not have any additional AA guns added after this time.|$|E
25|$|Since <b>active</b> <b>sonar</b> {{reveals the}} {{presence}} and position of the operator, and does not allow exact classification of targets, it is used by fast (planes, helicopters) and by noisy platforms (most surface ships) but rarely by submarines. When <b>active</b> <b>sonar</b> is used by surface ships or submarines, it is typically activated very briefly at intermittent periods {{to minimize the risk}} of detection. Consequently, <b>active</b> <b>sonar</b> is normally considered a backup to passive sonar. In aircraft, <b>active</b> <b>sonar</b> is used in the form of disposable sonobuoys that are dropped in the aircraft's patrol area or in the vicinity of possible enemy sonar contacts.|$|E
25|$|Modern naval warfare makes {{extensive}} use of both passive and <b>active</b> <b>sonar</b> from water-borne vessels, aircraft and fixed installations. Although <b>active</b> <b>sonar</b> was used by surface craft in World War II, submarines avoided the use of <b>active</b> <b>sonar</b> due to the potential for revealing their presence and position to enemy forces. However, the advent of modern signal-processing enabled the use of passive sonar as a primary means for search and detection operations. In 1987 a division of Japanese company Toshiba reportedly sold machinery to the Soviet Union that allowed their submarine propeller blades to be milled so that they became radically quieter, making the newer generation of submarines more difficult to detect.|$|E

25|$|Two high {{frequency}} <b>active</b> <b>sonars</b> {{mounted in the}} sail and bow. The chin-mounted (below the bow) and sail-mounted {{high frequency}} sonars supplement the (spherical/LAB) main sonar array, enabling safer operations in coastal waters, enhancing under-ice navigation, and improving anti-submarine warfare performance.|$|R
25|$|This is an <b>active</b> <b>sonar</b> {{device that}} {{receives}} a stimulus and immediately (or with a delay) retransmits the received signal or a predetermined one.|$|E
25|$|The use of <b>active</b> <b>sonar</b> by a {{submarine}} to determine bearing is extremely rare {{and will not}} necessarily give high quality bearing or range information to the submarines fire control team. However, use of <b>active</b> <b>sonar</b> on surface ships is very common and is used by submarines when the tactical situation dictates {{it is more important}} to determine the position of a hostile submarine than conceal their own position. With surface ships, it might be assumed that the threat is already tracking the ship with satellite data as any vessel around the emitting sonar will detect the emission. Having heard the signal, it is easy to identify the sonar equipment used (usually with its frequency) and its position (with the sound wave's energy). <b>Active</b> <b>sonar</b> is similar to radar in that, while it allows detection of targets at a certain range, it also enables the emitter to be detected at a far greater range, which is undesirable.|$|E
25|$|H/SQZ-3 sonar (with {{transducer}} {{designated as}} Type 603) is an <b>active</b> <b>sonar</b> installed on first generation Chinese nuclear submarines {{when they were}} first launched, and it is no longer in service, replaced by H/SQZ-262B.|$|E
40|$|This report summarises {{the outcome}} of an {{international}} research cruise in Norwegian waters (Vestfjorden) in November 2006. The objectives of the trial were to study impacts of military low frequency - (LFAS 1 - 2 kHz) and mid frequency - (MFAS 6 - 7 kHz) <b>active</b> <b>sonars</b> on killer whales and herring. In addition the capability of <b>active</b> and passive <b>sonar</b> systems for detection of marine mammals, in order to mitigate possible effects of sonars or seismic sources, were tested...|$|R
50|$|Bandshifting is {{employed}} in <b>active</b> and passive <b>sonar</b> {{to reduce the}} complexity of the hardware and software required for subsequent processing. For example，in <b>active</b> <b>sonars</b> the received signal is contained in a very narrow band of frequencies, typically about 2 kHz, centered at some high frequency, typically about 50 kHz. To avoid having to sample the received process at the Nyquist rate of 100 kHz, it is more efficient to demodulate the process to baseband and then employ sampling of the complex envelope at only 2 kHz.|$|R
25|$|The Mackenzie {{class were}} {{equipped}} with one SPS-12 air search radar, one SPS-10B surface search radar and one Sperry Mk.2 navigation radar. For detection below the surface, the ships had one SQS-501 high frequency bottom profiler sonar, one SQS-503 hull mounted <b>active</b> search <b>sonar,</b> one SQS-502 high frequency mortar control sonar and one SQS-11 hull mounted <b>active</b> search <b>sonar.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{gyro compass}} was {{introduced}} in 1908. The first passive sonar hydrophones were introduced into the RN in 1914 while ASDIC (<b>active</b> <b>sonar)</b> came in afterwards.

25|$|Between 1915 and 1917, Painlevé {{served as}} French Minister for Public Instruction and Inventions. In December 1915, he {{requested}} a scientific exchange agreement between France and Britain, resulting in Anglo-French collaboration that {{ultimately led to}} the parallel development by Paul Langevin in France and Robert Boyle in Britain of the first <b>active</b> <b>sonar.</b>|$|E
50|$|Initially {{the ships}} were {{outfitted}} with one SPS-12 air search radar, one SPS-10B surface search radar, and one Sperry Mk.2 navigation radar. For sensing below the surface, {{the class was}} given one SQS-501 high frequency bottom profiler sonar, one SQS-502 high frequency mortar control sonar, one SQS-503 hull mounted <b>active</b> search <b>sonar</b> and one SQS-504 VDS medium frequency <b>active</b> search <b>sonar.</b> For fire control purposes they were given one Mk 64 GFCS fire control with SPG-48 tracker (GUNAR).|$|R
40|$|To {{resolve the}} problem that {{reverberation}} signal usually seriously affect <b>active</b> <b>sonar’s</b> detection performance, Blind Source Separation method of the Fractional Fourier Domain is adopted in this study. First, the Fractional Fourier Transform is used to enhance the signal-to-reverberation ratio. And then the separation condition is analyzed and target echo is separated from the received signal by using the Blind Source Separation method. At last, the highlight characteristic of the underwater target is extracted. Simulation and experiment data processing affirm {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method...|$|R

25|$|Work on sonar {{had also}} been {{carried out in the}} Axis countries, notably in Germany, which {{included}} countermeasures. At the end of World War II, this German work was assimilated by Britain and the U.S. Sonars have continued to be developed by many countries, including USSR, for both military and civil uses. In recent years the major military development has been the increasing interest in low-frequency <b>active</b> <b>sonar.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sound waves travel {{differently}} through fish {{than through}} water because a fish's air-filled swim bladder {{has a different}} density than seawater. This density difference allows the detection of schools of fish by using reflected sound. Acoustic technology is especially well suited for underwater applications since sound travels farther and faster underwater than in air. Today, commercial fishing vessels rely almost completely on acoustic sonar and sounders to detect fish. Fishermen also use <b>active</b> <b>sonar</b> and echo sounder technology to determine water depth, bottom contour, and bottom composition.|$|E
25|$|Echo {{sounding}} is {{a process}} {{used to determine the}} depth of water beneath ships and boats. A type of <b>active</b> <b>sonar,</b> echo sounding is the transmission of an acoustic pulse directly downwards to the seabed, measuring the time between transmission and echo return, after having hit the bottom and bouncing back to its ship of origin. The acoustic pulse is emitted by a transducer which receives the return echo as well. The depth measurement is calculated by multiplying the speed of sound in water(averaging 1,500 meters per second) by the time between emission and echo return.|$|E

50|$|Currently the F123 {{class is}} being {{upgraded}} {{under the auspices}} of the Fähigkeitsanpassung FüWES (FAF) project. The primary component being upgraded under this program is the Combat Management System, for which a version of the Thales Nederland TACTICOS system will be used. The ships will also receive an IFF upgrade, to the EADS MSSR 2000 I secondary radar system. However, its primary radars, specifically its long-range 2D search radar, the Thales Nederland LW08, and its medium-range 3D surveillance radar, the Thales Nederland SMART-S, are to remain. The ships were to receive low-frequency <b>active</b> <b>sonars</b> under the Franco-German LFTASS programme but the French withdrew in 2000 and are now using a derivative of the British Sonar 2087; Bayern received the prototype TASS 6-3 sonar but it seems unlikely that more units will be ordered in the current budget environment.|$|R
25|$|Another {{application}} was for acoustic homing torpedoes. Two pairs of directional hydrophones were {{mounted on the}} torpedo nose, in the horizontal and vertical plane; the difference signals from the pairs were used to steer the torpedo left-right and up-down. A countermeasure was developed: the targeted submarine discharged an effervescent chemical, and the torpedo went after the noisier fizzy decoy. The counter-countermeasure was a torpedo with <b>active</b> <b>sonar</b> – a transducer {{was added to the}} torpedo nose, and the microphones were listening for its reflected periodic tone bursts. The transducers comprised identical rectangular crystal plates arranged to diamond-shaped areas in staggered rows.|$|E
25|$|Marine {{life can}} be {{susceptible}} to noise or the sound pollution from sources such as passing ships, oil exploration seismic surveys, and naval low-frequency <b>active</b> <b>sonar.</b> Sound travels more rapidly and over larger distances in the sea than in the atmosphere. Marine animals, such as cetaceans, often have weak eyesight, and {{live in a world}} largely defined by acoustic information. This applies also to many deeper sea fish, who {{live in a world of}} darkness. Between 1950 and 1975, ambient noise at one location in the Pacific Ocean increased by about ten decibels (that is a tenfold increase in intensity).|$|E
25|$|<b>Active</b> <b>sonar</b> is {{also used}} to measure {{distance}} through water between two sonar transducers or a combination of a hydrophone (underwater acoustic microphone) and projector (underwater acoustic speaker). A transducer is a device that can transmit and receive acoustic signals ("pings"). When a hydrophone/transducer receives a specific interrogation signal it responds by transmitting a specific reply signal. To measure distance, one transducer/projector transmits an interrogation signal and measures the time between this transmission and the receipt of the other transducer/hydrophone reply. The time difference, scaled by the speed of sound through water and divided by two, is the distance between the two platforms. This technique, when used with multiple transducers/hydrophones/projectors, can calculate the relative positions of static and moving objects in water.|$|E
40|$|Broadband <b>active</b> <b>sonars</b> (15 - 150 kHz) capture {{morphological}} {{characteristics of}} underwater objects {{and are used}} by dolphins to recognize targets in cluttered environments, motivating their use in underwater mine countermeasure applications. However, the data from broadband sonars is very high-dimensional (typically 1400), requiting classification algorithms that can operate in these spaces with limited mining data. Standard statistical approaches such as probability density estimation are often ill-suited to this task. This paper presents a new algorithm for mine-like object recognition that has shown promising results during in-water tests. The technique employs a nearest-neighbor classifier {{in conjunction with a}} non-metric similarity function and synthetic augmentation of the training data. Experimental results are presented comparing this method to a standard algorithm (LDA/PCA) and indicating that the nearest-neighbor approach addresses some deficiencies in existing techniques for the mine-like object recognition problem...|$|R

500|$|An {{alternative}} to the fathometer was devised involving {{the use of the}} ship's active forward search sonar in conjunction with the gravity meter installed in the combat intelligence center (CIC). By using both systems in tandem, underwater masses could be detected and avoided, although this approach lacked the capability of the fathometer to echo-sound the depth of the ocean floor. [...] On 13 March, Triton detected a submerged peak using <b>active</b> <b>sonar</b> and the gravity meter that confirmed the feasibility of this procedure.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWith ever larger amounts of power being required by present day <b>active</b> <b>sonars,</b> studies {{are being made}} towards improving {{the efficiency of the}} power train. A gain in efficiency is possible if non-linear switching type amplifiers are used in lieu of the linear amplifiers presently used.

The circuit examined readily met the required criteria, however, the real value of this study lies in the method of predicting transient performance. Use of this derived equivalent circuit, and an analog computer model based on the transfer functions (E(L) /E and I(1) /E), provide analytical solutions that can be arrived at more readily than by other methods.
