2500|$|In 1961 the NSW Ambulance {{commenced}} {{rescue operations}} when the St. George-Sutherland District Ambulance Service purchased a specially equipped rescue vehicle {{known at the}} time as the [...] "Res-Q-Van", or [...] "Q Van".

2500|$|Prior to 1977 the [...] "training" [...] of Ambulance Officers was {{arranged}} in an ad-hoc fashion to a varying degree of first aid preparation to enable {{passage of a}} national examination administered {{on behalf of the}} Department of Health by an Examination Board of the Order of St John; a requirement established by the Ambulance Transport Advisory Board in 1963. [...] Despite the content of this examination being described as [...] "very basic" [...] the requirement for some degree of formal <b>Ambulance</b> <b>Officer</b> education and training is one of the earliest in the world; in contrast the Ambulance Service of New South Wales established the Ambulance Education Centre at Rozelle (Sydney) in 1961 – although the first graduates were not until 1966, Geelong & Districts Ambulance in Victoria (Australia) began a training school in 1962 [...] and the Province of Ontario (Canada) implemented a requirement for a five-week, 160-hour [...] "Fundamentals of Casualty Care" [...] course for ambulance attendants in 1967.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The Mental Health Intervention Project (MHIP) was {{established}} in Queensland in 2005 to improve interagency collaboration {{in the management of}} mental health crisis situations. The aim of this present study was to assess changes in the use of Emergency Examination Orders (EEOs) by police and <b>ambulance</b> <b>officers</b> since the commencement of the MHIP. Method: Information concerning the use of EEOs was analysed to highlight changes that have occurred since the inception of the MHIP. Results: The use of EEOs by police and <b>ambulance</b> <b>officers</b> increased by 262 % since 2002. The proportion of EEOs completed by <b>ambulance</b> <b>officers</b> has increased from 14. 5 % in 2004 to 38 % in 2010. Involuntary assessment was deemed necessary for {{less than half of the}} individuals presented by police and <b>ambulance</b> <b>officers.</b> Conclusions: Police continue to generate two-thirds of all EEOs completed. Police and <b>ambulance</b> <b>officers</b> may benefit from additional training in the use of EEOs. Providing alternative accommodation/treatment options for those under the influence of alcohol and other drugs may help to reduce the inappropriate use of EEOs and subsequent demand for Emergency Department services...|$|R

2500|$|Although the Hong Kong Fire Service {{maintains}} that its ambulances provide paramedic service, the current {{highest level of}} training is what most would recognise as a US EMT-Intermediate level, including IV therapy, airway management using Combitube, defibrillation, and a limited range of drugs, given orally or by injection. The exact corresponding qualifications are the Canadian province of British Columbia's EMA 1 and 2 levels. [...] New recruits for Ambulanceman/Ambulancewoman and Probationary <b>Ambulance</b> <b>Officer</b> undergo 26 weeks of training at the Hong Kong Fire Service Ambulance Command Training School (FSACTS) in Ma On Shan, NT. This provides them with an enhanced Basic Life Support level of training. [...] An additional two weeks of training is provided to motorcycle operators. [...] Once training is completed and a suitable amount of experience is obtained, the candidate will be provided with an additional six weeks of training, elevating them to the Intermediate level. This training is conducted in co-operation with the Justice Institute of British Columbia, and has been granted equivalency. Hong Kong has aspirations to offer full ALS services, and have recently completed a study of how such services are trained and provided internationally.|$|E
2500|$|To {{coincide}} with {{introduction of the}} various upskilling packages in the early 2000s there was a {{move away from the}} once nationally consistent qualification titles (<b>Ambulance</b> <b>Officer,</b> Intermediate Care Officer, Advanced Care Officer (Paramedic)) that existed under the National Training School to the introduction of new titles into each of the services. [...] St John renamed Intermediate Care Officer to [...] "Paramedic" [...] and Paramedic (ACO) to [...] "Advanced Paramedic" [...] in 2001 along with a new national uniform. [...] Wellington Free Ambulance chose to rename all staff qualified at National Certificate (Proficiency) or Intermediate Aid to [...] "Paramedic" [...] and their Paramedics (ACOs) to [...] "Intensive Care Paramedic". There is anecdotal suggestion that the renaming of staff who did not hold the full National Diploma/Advanced Aid to [...] "Paramedic" [...] was {{due in part to the}} high media profile of programs such as Third Watch and Rescue 911 which glorified and glamorised the role of [...] "Paramedic" [...] thus giving the public an expectation that they, as on TV, should be attended to by a [...] "Paramedic". [...] It has also been recorded that the move to rename Intermediate Care Officer to [...] "Paramedic" [...] on the part of St John was somewhat motivated by their desire to expedite contract negotiations with the Ministry of Health and ACC which required a certain number of [...] "Paramedics" [...] however it can be logically assumed that the contract did not actually define what a [...] "Paramedic" [...] was, as the original definition of a Paramedic in New Zealand was somebody qualified to National Diploma/Advanced Care level.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Hospital-based clinicians {{have been}} shown to use and attain {{benefits}} from online evidence systems. To our knowledge there have been no studies investigating whether and how <b>ambulance</b> <b>officers</b> use online evidence systems if provided. We surveyed <b>ambulance</b> <b>officers</b> to examine their knowledge and use of the Clinical Information Access Program (CIAP), an online evidence system providing 24 -hour access to information to support evidence-based practice. Methods A questionnaire was completed by 278 <b>ambulance</b> <b>officers</b> in New South Wales, Australia. Comparisons were made between those who used CIAP and officers who had heard of, but not used CIAP. Results Half the sample (48. 6 %) knew of, and 28. 8 % had used CIAP. Users {{were more likely to have}} heard of CIAP from a CIAP representative/presentation, non-users from written information. Compared to <b>ambulance</b> <b>officers</b> who had heard of but had not used CIAP, users were more likely to report better computer skills and that their supervisors regarded use of CIAP as a legitimate part of ambulance officers' clinical role. The main reasons for non-use were lack of access(49. 0 %) and training(31. 4 %). Of users, 51. 3 % rated their skills at finding information as good/very good, 67. 5 % found the information sought all/most of the time, 87. 3 % believed CIAP had the potential to improve patient care and 28. 2 % had directly experienced this. Most access to CIAP occurred at home. The databases frequently accessed were MIMS (A medicines information database) (73. 8 %) and MEDLINE(67. 5 %). The major journals accessed were Journal of Emergency Nursing(37. 5 %), American Journal of Medicine(30. 0 %) and JAMA(27. 5 %). Conclusion Over half of <b>ambulance</b> <b>officers</b> had not heard of CIAP. The proportion who knew about and used CIAP was also low. Reasons for this appear to be a work culture not convinced of CIAP's relevance to pre-hospital patient care and lack of access to CIAP at work. <b>Ambulance</b> <b>officers</b> who used CIAP accessed it primarily from home and valued it highly. Lack of access to CIAP at central work locations deprives <b>ambulance</b> <b>officers</b> of many of the benefits of an online evidence system. </p...|$|R
