5|$|Fuseli painted other {{versions}} of The Nightmare following {{the success of}} the first; at least three survive. The other important canvas was painted between 1790 and 1791 and is held at the Goethe Museum in Frankfurt. It is smaller than the original, and the woman's head lies to the left; a mirror opposes her on the right. The demon is looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> rather than out of the picture, and it has pointed, catlike ears. The most significant difference in the remaining two versions is an erotic statuette of a couple on the table.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Ed {{is fired}} via telephone. He hears the same voice as before and yells <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> living below him, {{thinking}} it was her. Upon hearing the voice after a pair of Jehovah's Witnesses stop by, Ed goes downstairs and murders his neighbor, throwing her body in the furnace. When her voice talks to him again, Jerse realizes it is coming from his new tattoo. Scully heads to Philadelphia and watches Pudovkin enter a tattoo parlor. Inside, she sees Ed arguing with the owner, wanting the tattoo removed. Ed strikes {{up a conversation with}} Scully and invites her out to dinner, which she initially declines.|$|E

5|$|The video's main {{theme is}} a romantic fantasy narrative. It {{begins with a}} montage of pencil {{drawings}} in a comic-book style representing motorcycle sidecar racing, in which the hero, played by Morten Harket, is pursued by two opponents, {{one of whom is}} played by English actor Philip Jackson. It then cuts to a scene in a cafe, in which a young woman, played by Bunty Bailey (Harket's girlfriend at the time), is seen drinking coffee and reading the comic book in a coffee shop. As the woman reads, the waitress brings her the bill. The comic's hero, after winning the race, seemingly winks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> from the page. His pencil-drawn hand reaches out of the comic book, inviting the woman into it. Once inside, she too appears in the pencil-drawn form, as he sings to her and introduces her to his black-and-white world which features a sort of looking-glass portal where people and objects look real on one side and pencil-drawn on the other.|$|E

25|$|Two {{additional}} works cited by scholars as important precedents for Le déjeuner sur l'herbe are Pastoral Concert (c. 1510, The Louvre) and The Tempest (Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice), {{both of which}} are attributed variously to Italian Renaissance masters Giorgione or Titian. The Tempest is an enigmatic painting featuring a fully dressed man and a nude woman in a rural setting. The man is standing to the left and gazing to the side, apparently <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> who is seated and breastfeeding a baby; {{the relationship between the two}} figures is unclear. In Pastoral Concert, two clothed men and a nude woman are seated on the grass, engaged in music making, while a second nude woman stands beside them.|$|E

2500|$|Pickett {{continued}} to record with {{success on the}} R charts for RCA in 1973 and 1974, scoring four top 30 R hits with [...] "Mr. Magic Man", [...] "Take a Closer Look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Woman</b> You're With", [...] "International Playboy" [...] (a re-recording of a song he had previously recorded for Atlantic), and [...] "Soft Soul Boogie Woogie". However, he was failing to cross over to the pop charts with regularity, as none of these songs reached higher than #90 on the Hot 100. In 1975, with Pickett's once-prominent chart career on the wane, RCA dropped Pickett from the label. After being dropped, he formed the short-lived Wicked label, where he released one LP, Chocolate Mountain. In 1978, he made a disco album with Big Tree Records titled Funky Situation, which is a coincidence as, at that point, Big Tree was distributed by his former label, Atlantic. The following year, he released an album on EMI titled I Want You.|$|E
2500|$|The Ancient Greeks and Romans {{believed}} the blood, excrement, rectum, genitalia, eyes, tongue, hair, skin, and fat, {{as well as}} the ash of different parts of the striped hyena's body, were effective means to ward off evil and to ensure love and fertility. The Greeks and Romans believed that the genitalia of a hyena [...] "would hold a couple peaceably together" [...] and that a hyena anus worn as an amulet on the upper arm would make its male possessor irresistible to women. [...] In West and South Asia, hyena body parts apparently {{play an important role in}} love magic and in the making of amulets. In Iranian folklore, it is mentioned that a stone found in the hyenas body can serve as a charm of protection for whoever wears it on his upper arm. In the Pakistani province of Sindh, the local Muslims place the tooth of a striped hyena over churns in order not to lose the milk's baraka. In Iran, a dried striped hyena pelt is considered a potent charm which forces all to succumb to the possessors attraction. In Afghanistan and Pakistan striped hyena hair is used either in love magic or as a charm in sickness. Hyena blood has been held in high regard in northern India as potent medicine, and the eating of the tongue helps fight tumors. In the Khyber area, burned striped hyena fat is applied to a man's genitals or sometimes taken orally to ensure virility, while in India the fat serves as a cure for rheumatism. In Afghanistan, some mullahs wear the vulva (kus) of a female striped hyena wrapped in silk under their armpits for a week. If a man peers through the vulva <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> of his desire, he will invariably get hold of her. This has led to the proverbial expression in Dari of kus-e kaftar bay, as well as in Pashto of kus-e kaftar which literally mean [...] "it happens as smoothly as if you would look through the vulva of a female striped hyena". In the North-West Frontier Province and Baluchistan, the Pakhtun keep the vulva in vermilion powder, itself having aphrodesic connotations. The rectum of a freshly killed striped hyena is likewise used by homosexuals and bisexuals to attract young men. This has led to the expression [...] "to possess the anus of a [...] hyena" [...] which denotes somebody who is attractive and has many lovers. A striped hyena's penis kept in a small box filled with vermilion powder can be used for the same reasons.|$|E
