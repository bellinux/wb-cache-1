5|$|Modern mythographers {{have seen}} the story of Orion {{as a way to}} access local folk tales and cultic {{practices}} directly without the interference of ancient high culture; several of them have explained Orion, each through his own interpretation of Greek prehistory <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> Greek mythology represents it. There are some points of general agreement between them: for example, that the attack on Opis is an attack on Artemis, for Opis is one of the names of Artemis.|$|E
5|$|Unfinished Tales also {{contains}} various drafts {{not included in}} The Lord of the Rings that describe Saruman's attempts to frustrate Sauron's chief servants, the Nazgûl, {{in their search for}} the Ring during the early part of The Fellowship of the Ring; in one version he considers throwing himself on Gandalf's mercy. There is also a description of how Saruman becomes involved with the Shire <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> he gradually becomes jealous of Gandalf. Another brief account describes how the five Istari were chosen by the Valar for their mission.|$|E

25|$|Work by Herbert Benson {{argues that}} humans have an innate 'breakout principle' which {{provides}} creative solutions and peak experiences which allow {{the restoration of}} a 'new-normal' state of higher functioning. This breakout principle is activated by severing connections with current circular or repetitive thinking. This is heavily reminiscent of Health Realization discussion of the Principle of Mind <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> it is activated.|$|E
25|$|John D. Barrow and Frank J.

25|$|This short novel {{serves as}} a prequel to His Dark Materials and focuses on the Texan {{aeronaut}} Lee Scoresby as a young man. After winning his hot-air balloon, Scoresby heads to the North, landing on the Arctic island Novy Odense, where he is pulled into a conflict between the oil tycoon Larsen Manganese, the corrupt mayoral candidate Ivan Poliakov, and his longtime enemy from the Dakota Country, Pierre McConville. The story tells of Lee and Iorek's first meeting <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> they overcame these enemies.|$|E
25|$|In February 1859 Wardell was {{appointed}} architect for St John's College. Working from Melbourne, he drew up the general plans {{and sent them}} to Sydney in May 1859. Wardell designed St John's College as a three-storeyed sandstone Gothic Revival building on an H-shaped plan but because of budget restrictions with a limit of A₤30,000, July and August saw discussion of Wardell's design <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> much could be built within the budget. In September and October the general plans were approved by the St John's Council and the University Senate. During the period from October 1859 to April 1860 relations between Wardell and the Council deteriorated for various reasons, ultimately ending with Wardell's resignation in June 1860.|$|E
25|$|Eliade {{provided}} {{two distinct}} explanations {{for not having}} met with Sebastian: one was related to his claim of being followed around by the Gestapo, and the other, expressed in his diaries, was that the shame of representing a regime that humiliated Jews had made him avoid facing his former friend. Another take on the matter was advanced in 1972 by the Israeli magazine Toladot, who claimed that, as an official representative, Eliade was aware of Antonescu's agreement to implement the Final Solution in Romania <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> this could affect Sebastian (see Holocaust in Romania). In addition, rumors were sparked that Sebastian and Nina Mareş had a physical relationship, one which could {{have contributed to the}} clash between the two literary figures.|$|E

500|$|Famitsus writers {{expressed}} disappointment {{over how}} the PSP version's graphics and screen size had not been changed {{in comparison to the}} Sega Saturn version, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> few adjustments had been made. Despite this, the reviewers positively noted the easier gameplay experience and praised the battle system. Kalata and Snelgrove appreciated the graphics used in the game's dungeons, which they found to be detailed and better-looking than ones in previous games in the series; they also appreciated the battle transitions. On the other hand, they found the graphics for the game's maps to be [...] "not particularly impressive looking", and the graphics for the enemies to be lacking and [...] "barely animated".|$|E

500|$|For {{the first}} game, Meguro made heavy use of guitar music, taking his {{inspiration}} from {{music of the}} 1960s and 70s. It was meant to represent the vicious new nature of the environment, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the main protagonists gradually awoke to their humanity. Tsuchiya {{was in charge of}} environmental tracks that deviated from the normal layout and feel of the Junkyard. The game's battle theme, [...] "Hunting", was originally going to be the boss theme, but its instrumentation was wrong and so it was changed to the normal battle theme. For the second game, Meguro changed the original's dark tone to give it a harsher feel and techno instrumentation, reflecting the state of the real world and clashing with the views of the main characters. He also reached out to an external firm to help with fitting in more complicated tracks with less loops, getting round some of the limitations he faced with the first game.|$|E
500|$|Johansson is {{described}} as a sex symbol by the media, which considers her lips, green eyes, and voice among her trademarks. The Sydney Morning Herald describes Johansson as [...] "the embodiment of male fantasy". During the filming of Match Point, director Woody Allen said he found it [...] "very hard to be extra witty around a sexually overwhelming, beautiful young woman who is wittier than you are". In 2014, New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane wrote that [...] "she is evidently, and profitably, aware of her sultriness, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> much, down to the last inch, it contributes to the contours of her reputation." [...] Regardless, Johansson dislikes being [...] "super-sexualised" [...] as [...] "the new Marilyn Monroe" [...] and [...] "always be an object of desire. Because it doesn't last." [...] Johansson's sex appeal also cost her the lead role in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) as its director David Fincher thought she was [...] "too sexy" [...] for the part.|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{left the}} Beatles in September 1969, and {{agreed not to}} inform the media while the group renegotiated their {{recording}} contract, but he was outraged that McCartney publicised his own departure on releasing his debut solo album in April 1970. Lennon's reaction was, [...] "Jesus Christ! He gets all the credit for it!" [...] He later wrote, [...] "I started the band. I disbanded it. It's as simple as that." [...] In later interviews with Rolling Stone magazine, he revealed his bitterness towards McCartney, saying, [...] "I was a fool not to do what Paul did, which was use it to sell a record." [...] Lennon also spoke of the hostility he perceived the other members had towards Ono, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> he, Harrison, and Starr [...] "got fed up with being sidemen for Paul... After Brian Epstein died we collapsed. Paul took over and supposedly led us. But what is leading us when we went round in circles?" ...|$|E

500|$|Fouad Ajami criticised Aflaq {{for a lack}} of real substance, stating, [...] "Nearly {{three hundred}} pages of text yield no insight, on his part, into what went wrong and what needed to be done; there is only the visible infatuation with words" [...] and [...] "Aflaq summons the party to renounce power and go back to its 'pure essence'". There is some truth in this critique. Aflaq spent much time and energy writing optimistically about the future, and the past, of the Arab Nation, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the Arab World could be unified. As Kanan Makiya, the author of Republic of Fear: The Politics of Modern Iraq, notes: for [...] "Aflaq, reality is {{confined}} to the inner world of the party." [...] In contrast to other philosophers, such as Karl Marx or John Locke, Aflaq's ideological view of the world makes no clear stand on the materialistic or socioeconomic behavior of humanity. While other philosophers make distinctions between what is real and what is not real, that is between prescriptive and descriptive analysis, [...] Aflaq did not as a rule define what is and what ought to be. [...] In his thought both are molded into the same category: that which is attainable.|$|E
500|$|Hill {{has participated}} in various {{television}} productions, such as Survival of the Fittest, which she won four seasons in a row, from 1980 to 1984; she beat Olympic athletes at rope climbing and cross-country running. It was rock climbing legend and personal hero Beverly Johnson who first asked Hill to compete. The inaugural year of the competition, the first prize for {{the men in the}} competition was US$15,000 and for the women, US$5,000. Angered, Hill asked for parity, arguing that since the women were competing in four events and the men six, the women should at least be awarded $10,000. She proposed a boycott to the other female competitors, negotiating a deal with the producer that the prize money would be raised the next year and she could compete again. In her autobiography, Hill writes that she heard a rumor that NBC canceled the women's half of the show because the producers could not find anyone to beat her. She [...] "became increasingly aware of how few women were pushing the limits of climbing and endurance like I was, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> my passion had led me very much into a man's world". During the early 1980s Hill also appeared on The Guinness Game, That's Incredible!, and Ripley's Believe it or Not. She describes her feat of climbing over a hot-air balloon at 6,000 feet for That's Incredible! as [...] "perhaps the most ridiculous stunt I ever did". Despite the earlier television appearances Hill attributes her fame to a 1982 poster for the company Patagonia that showed a photograph of her climbing.|$|E
