5|$|Alexander Karelin {{was awarded}} for his {{recognition}} {{as the greatest}} wrestler of all time (from antiquity to the present day). He was a Greco-Roman wrestler in the Olympics, and in his career he won 887 bouts and lost only 2 times. His losses are controversial because commentators believe they were caused by trivial rule changes, not <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> athletic defeat.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these physical advantages, the serum also greatly enhanced Norman's already-above average intellect, making him <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> genius capable of making breakthroughs in advanced areas of genetics, robotics, engineering, physics and applied chemistry. The Goblin formula is also said to have driven Osborn insane; defects in his personality were strongly augmented by the serum, resulting in dangerous mood-swings and hallucinations.|$|E
5|$|Congress is not {{prevented}} from legislating as to tribes generally; and {{this appears to}} be what it has done in successive versions of the Nonintercourse Act. There is nothing in the Act to suggest that ‘tribe’ is to be read to exclude <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> tribe not otherwise federally recognized. Nor, as the district court found, is there evidence of congressional intent or legislative history squaring with appellants' interpretation. Rather we find an inclusive reading consonant with the policy and purpose of the Act.|$|E
50|$|D, {{owner of}} goods at a warehouse, was induced by F's fraud to {{instruct}} the warehouseman ('W') {{to transfer the}} goods to F. F then sold the goods to <b>an</b> <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> purchaser ('P'). W then stated to P that he was holding the goods at P's order. When F's fraud was discovered, W refused to deliver the goods to P. P sued.|$|R

50|$|A {{generalization}} {{of the idea}} of geometric borders is the idea of fiat boundaries, by which is meant any sort of boundary which does not track <b>an</b> underlying <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> physical discontinuity. Fiat boundaries are typically the product of human demarcation—for example in demarcating electoral districts or postal districts, but also in demarcating the regions of the brain.|$|R
5|$|An {{undertaking}} of {{the restoration}} team was {{that everything would}} be handled in a transparent fashion, that reporters, art historians and others with <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> interest should have ready access to information and to view the work. However, a single company, Nippon Television Network Corporation, had sole photography rights. Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of The New York Times, wrote, in 1991, that the criticism of {{the restoration of the}} ceiling and lunettes was in part fuelled by the Nippon Television Network's reluctance to make public those photographs that they had taken by exclusive right, which had recorded every stage of the process and which were the only solid evidence that the work was being done appropriately.|$|E
5|$|When the {{nominations}} were announced on January 25, {{the field of}} Best Picture nominees did not include <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> blockbuster at the U.S. box office. It {{was the first time}} since 1986 that none of the five films in that category were among the top ten releases in box office prior to {{the nominations}} announcement. Furthermore, before the ceremony, all five films sold the lowest cumulative number of tickets sold since 1984. Ray was the highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $73million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by The Aviator ($58.4million), Finding Neverland ($32.7million), Sideways ($32.4million), and finally Million Dollar Baby ($8.4million). The combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees when the Oscars were announced was $205million with an average gross of $41.3million per film.|$|E

5000|$|So-called [...] "freelancers" [...] {{are covered}} under the CBA {{if they are}} working as {{employees}} of <b>a</b> signator employer. <b>Bona</b> <b>fide</b> independent contractors are not covered, since they are not employees of the company for which they perform work.|$|R
50|$|Latec Investments Ltd v Hotel Terrigal Pty Ltd {{establishes}} that, in New South Wales, {{there are}} 3 classes of equitable interests: equitable interest, mere equity and personal equity. Mere equity, for example, may arise when one {{party has been}} unjustly disadvantaged by the unconscionable behaviour of another. Importantly, however, a ‘mere equity’ will not prevail over <b>an</b> actual <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> equitable interest - such as an equitable charge.|$|R

25|$|While {{this may}} be true, trying to {{separate}} Haq's actions from {{the larger context of}} the war on terrorism is tunnel vision at its worst. It is not just hate that motivates such acts, but ideology. One needn't be <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> member of an Islamic terrorist group to share their outlook.|$|E
25|$|In response, Citizens United {{produced}} a documentary, called Celsius 41.11, {{highly critical of}} both FAHRENHEIT 9/11 and 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. The FEC, however, held that showing the movie and advertisements for it would violate the Federal Election Campaign Act, because Citizens United was not <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> commercial film maker.|$|E
50|$|Stonegate Securities Ltd v Gregory 1980 Ch 576 is a UK {{insolvency}} law case concerning the liquidation procedure {{when a company}} is unable to repay its debts.

25|$|In {{the wake}} of these decisions, Citizens United sought to {{establish}} itself as <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> commercial film maker before the 2008 elections, producing several documentary films between 2005 and 2007. By early 2008, it sought to run television commercials to promote its political documentary Hillary: The Movie and to air the movie on DirecTV.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} Scientology is hotly debated in many countries. The Church of Scientology pursues an {{extensive}} public relations campaign arguing that Scientology is <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> religion. The organization cites {{a number of}} studies and experts who support their position. Critics point out that most cited studies were commissioned by Scientology to produce the desired results.|$|E
25|$|Polo is now {{an active}} sport in 77 countries, and {{although}} its tenure as an Olympic sport was limited to 1900–1939, in 1998 the International Olympic Committee recognised it as a sport with <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> international governing body, the Federation of International Polo. The World Polo Championship is held every three years by the Federation of International Polo.|$|E
50|$|We also wish {{to express}} our {{appreciation}} of Ms. Pinki Virani who filed this petition.

50|$|Ungoed Thomas J {{held that}} the winding up {{petition}} could not succeed. It would be an abuse of process {{to ask for a}} winding up petition when <b>a</b> debt was <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> under dispute. Here, the parties were actually disputing the existence of the debt, so the winding up petition had to be rejected. His judgment was as follows.|$|R

25|$|Floating charges {{take effect}} in equity only, and {{consequently}} are defeated by <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> {{purchaser for value}} without notice of any asset covered by them. In practice, as the chargor has power to dispose of assets subject to a floating charge, so this is only of consequence in relation to disposals that occur after the charge has crystallised.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Martin Roach's book Bugatti Veyron: A Quest for Perfection – The Story of the Greatest Car in the World {{took the}} stance {{that the car}} had now become so famous that it is {{effectively}} <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> celebrity. The book follows its author as he attempts to track down and drive the car, along the way interviewing chief designers, test drivers, {{and the president of}} Bugatti.|$|E
25|$|The strong arm {{avoidance}} power {{stems from}} 11 U.S.C. § 544 and permits the trustee {{to exercise the}} rights that a debtor {{in the same situation}} would have under the relevant state law. Specifically, § 544(a) grants the trustee the rights of avoidance of (1) a judicial lien creditor, (2) an unsatisfied lien creditor, and (3) <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> purchaser of real property. In practice these avoidance powers often overlap with preference and fraudulent transfer avoidance powers.|$|E
60|$|That tithes are due {{of common}} right is readily granted; {{and if this}} {{principle}} had been kept in its original straitness, it might, indeed, be supposed that to plead an exemption was to plead a long-continued fraud, and that no man could be deceived in such a title,--as the moment he bought land, he must know that he bought land tithed: prescription could not aid him, for prescription can only attach on <b>a</b> supposed <b>bonâ</b> <b>fide</b> possession. But the fact is, that the principle has been broken in upon.|$|R
5000|$|Higgins has {{expressed}} {{that she does}} not condone bullying and she believes it is reprehensible.

25|$|Completed a {{day ahead}} of {{schedule}} and under budget, The Stranger was the only film made by Welles to have been <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> box office success upon its release. Its cost was $1.034 million; 15 months after its release it had grossed $3.216 million. Within weeks of {{the completion of the}} film, International Pictures backed out of its promised four-picture deal with Welles. No reason was given, but the impression was left that The Stranger would not make money.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to victims rights groups, TDCJ adopted a board rule in January 1996 allowing five victim witnesses (six for multiple victims). Initially the witnesses {{were limited to}} immediate family and individuals with a close relationship to the victim, but the board rule was modified in 1998 to allow close friends of surviving witnesses, and further modified in May 2008 to allow the victim witnesses {{to be accompanied by}} a spiritual advisor who is <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> pastor or comparable official of the victim's religion.|$|E
25|$|To {{comply with}} IATA's {{arbitrary}} transatlantic charter rules, Caledonian and other independent charter operators insisted {{that anyone who}} wanted a cheap transatlantic charter flight needed to be <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> member of an affinity group, and that the prospective traveller needed {{to be a member}} of such an organisation for a minimum period of six months. As a result, clubs and associations with names like Friends of Clan Albion, Anglo-Scottish-American Group, Anglo-American Families Association, Rose and Maple Amity Club, Paisley Buddies, British American Club, Canadian US Pacific Association etc. sprang up on both sides of the Atlantic.|$|E
