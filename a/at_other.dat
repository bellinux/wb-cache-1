In the Rockall Trough and the Catalan Sea, large adults are found in deeper waters than juveniles, which may serve to reduce competition between the two groups.

5000|$|Katagelasticism is a {{psychological}} {{condition in which}} a person excessively enjoys laughing <b>at</b> <b>others</b> (coined by Christian F. Hempelmann and Sean Harrigan from [...] (katagelastēs), Ancient Greek for “mocker”). Katagelasticists actively seek and establish situations in which they can laugh <b>at</b> <b>others</b> (<b>at</b> the expense of these people). There is a broad variety of things that katagelasticists would do—starting from harmless pranks or word plays to truly embarrassing and even harmful, mean-spirited jokes. They would be of the opinion that laughing <b>at</b> <b>others</b> is part of the daily life and if others do not like being laughed at, they should just fight back. For the katagelasticists it is fun laughing <b>at</b> <b>others</b> and there is almost nothing that might hinder them from doing so. For them, some people even might provoke getting laughed at (and surely deserve being laughed at). This condition often makes it difficult for sufferers to gain and maintain acquaintances and romantic partners.|$|R

However, there are a few exceptions, such as in Eastern Europe. At the Babiy Kamen site in the Kuznetsk Basin, numerous beetle fossils were discovered, including entire specimens of the infraorders Archostemata (e.g. Ademosynidae, Schizocoleidae), Adephaga (e.g., Triaplidae, Trachypachidae) and Polyphaga (e.g. Hydrophilidae, Byrrhidae, Elateroidea).
