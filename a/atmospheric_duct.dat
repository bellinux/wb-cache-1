This study has included the effect of terrain between Robledo and Madrid in evaluating the propagation modes, which include diffraction over the terrain, ducting through the atmosphere, and scattering by rain. It is a complete revision of a previous study wherein preliminary analysis of these phenomena was presented without taking the specific terrain into account. The predicted results concerning diffraction are consistent with measurements and with predictions of the Longleyâ€“Rice model. Because of attenuation by the hills, the expected power received through diffraction by a mobile receiver on ground level in Madrid is lower than the interference thresholds (âˆ’ 109 dBm) when the DSN antenna transmits at the normal power of 20 kW. The hills near the DSN antenna also provide much attenuation to the emissions propagated through <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ducting.</b> Considering the low duty cycle (12 percent or less) of about 2 GHz (S-band) transmissions at Robledo, the expected power of emissions propagated through <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ducting</b> does not exceed the receiver interference thresholds more than 0. 1 percent of the time.

Oral presentation: General synoptic situation over the Arabian Gulf (A. Almehrezi, D. Priestley) and the European Geosciences Union, Vienna, Austria, 27 April â€“ 02 May 2014. Poster presentation: Seasonal variations of Summer Shamal days in the southern Arabian Gulf (A. Almehrezi, G. Shapiro, R. Thain). The propagation of electromagnetic (EM) waves of frequencies above 100 MHz {{is affected by the}} existence and properties of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>duct,</b> i. e. a horizontal layer in the lower atmosphere in which radio signals propagate more efficiently. Atmospheric ducts can be found {{in many parts of the}} world ocean including the Arabian Gulf. Ambient winds blowing from different directions bring air masses of different properties into the area and hence have a significant impact on the formation and strength of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>duct.</b> However, little information is available on the long-term and intra-annual variability of wind and its effect on the ducting phenomenon in the Arabian Gulf region. This study addresses this gap by characterising the local meteorology, with a special emphasis on its effect on electromagnetic wave propagation. This study uses a new methodology to measure the persistence of Shamal wind, by considering the number of days associated with the specific wind pattern in addition to commonly used parameters such as the wind speed. In this study, thirty years (1981 - 2010) of observations and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data have been analyzed to identify a long-term trend and the intra-annual variability of various wind systems. Results clearly indicate that the Shamal (the northwesterly wind) is the most frequent meteorological feature over the region; therefore it has been investigated in greater detail. The Suhaili (southerly wind) is the second important wind which can occur any time of the year but it is less frequent than the Shamal. The Al-Nashi (cold and dry northeasterly wind) wind occurs only in December, January and February. The analysis shows that the wind strength and the frequency of Shamal days over the region have decreased over the last thirty years. Variations in the occurrence of summer and winter Shamal days were studied in relation to global atmospheric phenomena, and relationships have been established, synoptically and statistically between the frequency of Shamal days and large-scale atmospheric fluctuations. These links include atmospheric fluctuations over the Caspian Sea (a correlation coefficient of 0. 66) and Siberia (0. 69) in summer and Greenland (0. 51) and Western Europe (0. 65) in winter. The frequency of winter Shamal days during December, January and February are shown to be statistically related (a correlation coefficient of 0. 41) to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and (0. 49) the Arctic Oscillation (AO), as they influence the pathway of the westerly depression over the north Atlantic Ocean during the winter season. It is also shown that the decline in the number of Shamal days is linked to a decrease in the number of westerly depressions. The EM wave propagation has been examined using the Advanced Refraction Effects Prediction System (AREPS) model for different representative air masses. The radiosonde data from Abu Dhabi airport used in AREPS provided evidence of the general influence of each air mass. It was found that atmospheric ducting conditions and characteristics (height, thickness, and type) were variable in the lower part of the atmosphere (surface to 6000 m) as a result of changing air masses. The influence of the Shamal conditions develop an elevated duct at approximately 850 mb level. The Suhaili increases the thickness of the evaporation duct. In regards to the surface based and elevated duct, Suhaili and Al-Nashi provide standard atmospheric conditions. Land and sea breezes were mostly associated with the surface based duct and sometimes elevated the duct. Atmospheric ducting could extend the range of electromagnetic wave propagation above the usual range. Good knowledge of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>duct</b> characteristics enables the efficient assessment of the range of EM propagation, which is important for a number of practical applications, for example air traffic control and rescue operations. This could include the selection of the appropriate frequency and altitude of the electromagnetic wave device (e. g. radar and/or communication systems) operating with a frequency above 100 MHz to be trapped in the duct to cover long distances.

These are dominant phenomena in both terrestrial mobile and fixed wideband communications. In this thesis, multipath propagation mechanisms including diffraction, refraction, reflection and scattering are studied when radio waves interact with dielectric and metallic objects, or an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>duct.</b> Measurements were also performed for empirical modelling and validation of the theoretical work carried out in this thesis. By using physical optics (PO) method, the attenuation by double knife edges with ground reflections is solved {{for the first time}} under a general formula of the attenuation by multiple knife edges with ground reflections derived in this thesis, and some important and interesting conclusions are obtained. The attenuations by curvilinear-topped obstacles and by multiple flat-topped obstacles are also presented in closed forms. The results are the simplest and easiest ones available now, and they can be applied for field strength predictions both in mobile and fixed microwave communications. Based on three-ray (direct, reflected and super-refracted) and two-ray (direct and super-refracted) multipath models for plane and spherical earth, respectively, frequency selective fading (FSF) and depolarization due to clear air are studied by simulations and experiments for terrestrial line-of-sight (LOS) microwave links and dual-polarized communication systems. Novel simulation methods have been introduced and applied {{based on the fact that}} the amplitudes and excess delays of the rays are functions of the (modified) refractive index gradients which are random variables with exponential and normal distributions inside and outside the duct in lower atmosphere, respectively. Some important empirical or semi-empirical models and parameters are presented at 5 Â GHz based on large amount of measured data in indoor and outdoor environments. The results include path loss models, excess delay and rms delay spread, spatial and frequency correlations, window (sector) length of averaging fast fading components, path number distribution, and tapped-delay-line (TDL) channel models. These empirical or semi-empirical parameters and models are the latest results achieved at 5 Â GHz, and they are of great importance in designing of future wireless local area networks (WLAN), especially the TDL models are developed for the first time in this frequency band. Using a general autocorrelation function derived in this thesis for three-dimensional (3 -D) scattering environments, a novel theoretical modelling method is developed to study the propagation mechanisms of different types of Doppler spectra observed in measurements. The 3 -D autocorrelation function is connected to the probability density functions (PDF) of the angles of arrival (AoAs) of the scattered waves and the antenna radiation patterns in the azimuth and elevation planes. This is a new work which tries to define and explain the physical reasons of 3 -D Doppler spectra from propagation point of view. A new computer simulation method for wideband 3 -D received signal level in an urban environment is developed under the general assumptions of the distributions for path number, amplitude, excess delay etc. This simulation method can provide detailed fading characteristics for wideband mobile communications in a specific urban environment. reviewe...|$|E
