40|$|A measure {{commonly}} used to assess house prices is the house price?to? rent ratio. This ratio captures the <b>costs</b> of <b>alternative</b> forms of accommodation, namely buying or renting. In the long run these two costs should move together. If house prices rise compared to rents, more people may choose to rent rather than buy. This drives rents up and house prices down. In other words, if the <b>alternative</b> <b>costs</b> of accommodation are not moving together then people would switch between buying and renting.

5000|$|In microeconomic theory, the {{opportunity}} cost, {{also known as}} <b>alternative</b> <b>cost,</b> is the value (not a benefit) of {{the choice of a}} best <b>alternative</b> <b>cost</b> while making a decision. A choice needs to be made between several mutually exclusive alternatives; assuming the best choice is made, it is the [...] "cost" [...] incurred by not enjoying the benefit that would have been had by taking the second best available choice. [...] The New Oxford American Dictionary defines it as [...] "the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen." [...] Opportunity cost is a key concept in economics, and has been described as expressing [...] "the basic relationship between scarcity and choice." [...] The notion of opportunity cost plays a crucial part in attempts to ensure that scarce resources are used efficiently. Thus, opportunity costs are not restricted to monetary or financial costs: the real cost of output forgone, lost time, pleasure or any other benefit that provides utility should also be considered an opportunity cost.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the issue of}} a catastrophic environmental collapse and the way one should deal with it. In the model used here, one faces the choice to cross or not a critical threshold of pollution, which consequences are a definitive destruction of some environmental characteristic. The introduced decision-rule compares the economic cost of the emission constraint, designed to avoid the catastrophe, to the damage of the catastrophic event. Depending on the order between this <b>alternative</b> <b>costs,</b> the good choice can be either to cross the threshold of pollution or to respect it. ...|$|R

50|$|In the {{developing}} world a motorcycle {{is more likely to}} be the primary mode of transport for its owner, and often the owner's family as well. It is not uncommon for riders to transport multiple passengers or large goods aboard small motorcycles and scooters simply because there is no better <b>alternative.</b> <b>Cost</b> of ownership considerations regarding maintenance and parts, especially in remote areas, often place cars beyond the reach of families who find motorcycles comparatively affordable.

He underscored what he viewed as distinctive from that mainstream: economic subjectivism, imperfect knowledge, the heterogeneity of capital, the business cycle, methodological individualism, <b>alternative</b> <b>cost</b> and [...] "market process". His brand of Austrianism now forms the basis for the [...] "radical subjectivist" [...] strand of Austrian Economics.His work influenced later, American developments of the Austrian School.|$|E
