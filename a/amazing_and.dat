5|$|In 1952, Browne {{convinced}} Ziff-Davis to try {{a high-quality}} digest fantasy magazine. Fantastic, {{which appeared in the}} summer of that year, focused on fantasy rather than science fiction and was so successful that it persuaded Ziff-Davis to switch Amazing from pulp format to digest in early 1953 (while also switching to a bimonthly schedule). Circulation fell, however, and subsequent budget cuts limited the story quality in both <b>Amazing</b> <b>and</b> Fantastic. Fantastic began to print science fiction as well as fantasy. Circulation increased as a result, but Browne, who was not a science fiction aficionado, once again lost interest in the magazines.|$|E

5|$|White's {{ability to}} attract new writers {{suffered}} because of the low rates he paid: one cent per word, as compared to three or five cents per word at the leading competitive magazines. To compensate, White cultivated new writers whose experimental work was not selling elsewhere. White made a deal in 1971 with Gordon Eklund, who was hesitating to become a full-time writer because of the financial risks. White agreed to buy anything Eklund wrote, on condition that Eklund himself believed {{it was a good}} story. The result was that much of Eklund's fiction appeared in <b>Amazing</b> <b>and</b> Fantastic over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|When Sol Cohen bought both <b>Amazing</b> <b>and</b> Fantastic {{in early}} 1965, {{he decided to}} {{maximize}} profits by filling the magazines almost entirely with reprints. Cohen had acquired second serial rights from Ziff-Davis to all stories that had been printed in both magazines, {{and also in the}} companion magazines such as Fantastic Adventures. Joseph Wrzos, the new editor, persuaded Cohen that at least one new story should appear in each issue; there was sufficient inventory left over from Goldsmith's tenure for this to be done without acquiring new material. Readers initially approved of the policy, since it made available some well-loved stories from earlier decades that had not been reprinted elsewhere. Both of Wrzos's successors, Harry Harrison and Barry Malzberg, were unable to persuade Cohen to use more new fiction.|$|E
5|$|Amazing {{raised its}} price from 75 cents to $1.00 with the November 1975 issue. The {{schedule}} switched to quarterly {{beginning with the}} March 1976 issue; as a result, the 50th anniversary issue had a cover date of June 1976. In 1977, Cohen announced that <b>Amazing</b> <b>and</b> Fantastic had lost $15,000, though Amazings circulation (at nearly 26,000) {{was as good as}} it had been for several years. Cohen looked for a new publisher to buy the magazines, but in September of the following year sold his half-share in the company to his partner, Arthur Bernhard. White had occasionally suggested to Cohen that Amazing would benefit from a redesign and investment; he made the same suggestions to Bernhard in early October. According to White, Bernhard not only said no, but told him he would not receive a salary until the next issue was turned in. In late 1978 White resigned, and returned all manuscripts in his possession to their authors, even if copy-edited and ready for publication. White claimed Bernhard had told him to do this, though Bernhard denied it.|$|E

500|$|Goldsmith's open-minded {{approach}} {{meant that}} <b>Amazing</b> <b>and</b> Fantastic published some writers {{who did not}} fit into the other magazines. Philip K. Dick's sales to magazines had dropped, but his work {{began to appear in}} <b>Amazing,</b> <b>and</b> Goldsmith also regularly published David R. Bunch's stories of Moderan, a world whose inhabitants were part human and part metal.

500|$|Goldsmith is well {{regarded}} by science fiction historians for her innovation, {{and the impact}} she had on the early careers of writers such as Ursula K. Le Guin and Roger Zelazny, but circulation lagged during her tenure. By 1964 Fantastics circulation was down to 27,000, with Amazing doing little better. The following March both <b>Amazing</b> <b>and</b> Fantastic were sold to Ultimate Publishing Company, run by Sol Cohen and Arthur Bernhard. Goldsmith was given the choice of going with the magazines or staying with Ziff-Davis; she stayed, and Cohen hired Joseph Wrzos to edit the magazines, starting with the August and September 1965 issues of <b>Amazing</b> <b>and</b> Fantastic, respectively. Wrzos used the name [...] "Joseph Ross" [...] on the mastheads to avoid mis-spellings. Both magazines immediately moved to a bi-monthly schedule.|$|E

500|$|Circulation dropped {{for both}} <b>Amazing</b> <b>and</b> Fantastic; in 1964 Fantastic had a paid {{circulation}} of only 27,000. [...] In 1965 Sol Cohen, who {{at that time}} was Galaxys publisher, set up his own publishing company, Ultimate Publishing, and bought both <b>Amazing</b> <b>and</b> Fantastic from Ziff-Davis. [...] Cohen had decided to make the magazines as profitable as possible by filling them only with reprints. This was possible because Ziff-Davis had acquired second serial rights for all stories they had published, and since Cohen had bought the backfile of stories he was able to reprint them using these rights. [...] Using reprints in this way saved Cohen about $8,000 a year between the two magazines. [...] Lalli decided that {{she did not want to}} work for Cohen, and stayed with Ziff-Davis. [...] Her last issue was June 1965. [...] Cohen replaced Lalli with Joseph Wrzos, who used the name [...] "Joseph Ross" [...] on the magazines. [...] Cohen had met Wrzos at the Galaxy offices not long before; Wrzos was teaching English full-time, but had worked for Gnome Press as an assistant editor in 1953â€“1954.|$|E
