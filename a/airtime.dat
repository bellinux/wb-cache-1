50|$|The series, {{contrary}} to the belief of some, was not canceled due to large monetary losses. Despite the challenges of syndication, which included varying <b>airtimes</b> (sometimes late at night) in various markets, the series was able {{to operate in the}} black, but not producing a profit substantial enough for investors to back it financially.|$|R
5|$|In June 2011, {{during a}} public meeting, the FEC voted 5–1 to grant The Colbert Report a limited media {{exemption}}.

Following the hearing, Colbert formally filed paperwork {{for the creation of}} his Super PAC with the FEC secretary.|$|E
5|$|Just before 05:00, as his rebels {{continued}} their search, Major Hatanaka {{went to the}} NHK studios, and, brandishing a pistol, tried desperately to get some <b>airtime</b> to explain his actions. A little over an hour later, after receiving {{a telephone call from}} the Eastern District Army, Hatanaka finally gave up. He gathered his officers {{and walked out of the}} NHK studio.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} attack, {{hundreds}} of policemen and army forces personnel and two {{armored personnel carriers}} were brought into Yerevan, positioned on Baghramyan Avenue surrounding the National Assembly building. An anti-terrorist squad from Russia also participated in the operation. Meanwhile, ambulance vehicles rushed {{to the site of}} the shooting. President Robert Kocharyan was directing the operation of the security forces around the parliament building. While holding around 50 hostages inside the building, the men demanded a helicopter and <b>airtime</b> on national television for a political statement.|$|E
5000|$|While it ran, {{the program}} was billed as [...] "the longest-running gay-hosted show on {{commercial}} radio", and had an audience of over 40,000 listeners as of 1998. It was broadcast weekly from 11:00 p.m. on Sundays until 2:00 a.m. on Monday mornings; <b>airtimes</b> were later pushed back by an hour, to midnight Sunday nights.|$|R
50|$|At this time, {{the channel}} staff {{consisted}} of one full-time and one part-time employee.

50|$|Films {{that are}} {{broadcast}} {{on the network}} are edited for graphic profanity and inappropriate violent or sexual content, but are not edited for running times to fit in a set time block; start and end times for films airing on the network are influenced {{by a combination of}} the film's original running time and the commercial breaks inserted within the broadcast (the network limits the amount of advertising featured during its programming to twelve minutes per hour), with <b>airtimes</b> for films varying between the conventional top-and-bottom-of-the-hour scheduling (e.g., 6:30 a.m. or 8:00 p.m.) and incremental <b>airtimes</b> in margins of five minutes (e.g., 2:10 p.m. or 3:55 a.m.) that more closely mirror the scheduling structures of premium cable channels than those of other advertiser-supported networks (this scheduling format, which still results in a particular film's running time to be somewhat longer than the original runtime of its theatrical release depending on the content edits, was replicated by GetTV when it launched in February 2014).|$|R
5|$|Following the {{elimination}} of the United States ice hockey team, American television stations needed to fill <b>airtime</b> and chose to focus on the Jamaican bobsleigh team in the four-man event. The first run ended poorly, as when Dudley Stokes jumped into the bobsleigh, the push-bar in the sleigh broke, resulting in the team coming in third from last in 24th place. On their second attempt, the team ranked second to last, due in part to White struggling to crouch down properly in his seat, remaining almost upright through the first corner.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the Filipino Associated Broadcasting Company leased its <b>airtime</b> to the Malaysian {{broadcaster}} Media Prima (through {{the local}} subsidiary MPB Primedia) similar to an LMA – with MPB Primedia providing entertainment programming, and ABC handling news programming and operations. Soon afterward, ABC and Media Prima were sued by rival media company GMA {{for attempting to}} use the partnership to skirt laws requiring domestic ownership of broadcasters. In response, ABC's media relations head Pat Marcelo-Magbanua reiterated that the subsidiary was a Filipino company which was self-registered and Filipino-run. The concerns became moot in 2010, when Media Prima announced it would divest its ownership in the network to PLDT's broadcasting subsidiary MediaQuest Holdings.|$|E
5|$|North High School {{is home to}} KBEM-FM, a {{radio station}} owned by the Minneapolis Public Schools. The station signed {{on the air in}} October, 1970, and moved to North in 1983 when the Minneapolis Area Vocational Technical Institute, where the station had been located from its launch (as Vocational High School), closed and the {{building}} sold. Students are responsible for much of the station's operation, and 35 hours of <b>airtime</b> a week is devoted to student programming. Approximately 150 students are involved in the radio station's operation, with the majority attending North. Students typically enroll in the program as ninth-graders and are prepared for on-air duties by their junior or senior year.|$|E
50|$|Encore {{broadcasts}} {{its primary}} and multiplex channels on both Eastern and Pacific Time Zone schedules. The respective coastal feeds of each channel are usually packaged together (though most cable providers only offer {{the east and}} west coast feeds of the main Encore channel), resulting in the difference in local <b>airtimes</b> for a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being three hours at most.|$|R
50|$|On June 6, citing health concerns, owner Chris Lash leased out {{operating}} control of WYCL to Skylar Cato Broadcasting, managed by Philip Cato, who changed WYCL's format to locally produced talk radio. Louie b. Free moved his talk show from WGFT over to WYCL, {{where he had}} a succession of different <b>airtimes</b> during Skylar Cato management, and continued to broadcast on WYCL until late 2012.|$|R
50|$|Super Junior Full House (슈퍼주니어의 풀하우스) is {{a reality}} {{television}} series broadcast from May 27, 2006 to August 26, 2006. The show was a 25-minute comedy that aired every Saturday during the <b>airtimes</b> of SBS Realtime, after the airing of Love Letter. The show presents comedic experiences between the Korean boy band Super Junior and two female international students, who did a homestay with Super Junior for a month.|$|R
5|$|Due to the FCC's {{limits on}} station {{ownership}} {{at the time}} (which prevented the common ownership of multiple radio stations), local marketing agreements in radio, in which a smaller station would sell its entire <b>airtime</b> to a third-party in time-buy, were widespread between the 1970s and early 1990s. These alliances gave larger broadcasters a way to expand their reach, and smaller broadcasters a means of obtaining a stable stream of revenue. In 1992, the FCC began allowing broadcasting companies to own multiple radio stations in a single market. Following these changes, local marketing agreements largely fell out of favor for radio, as it was now possible for broadcasters to simply buy another station outright rather than lease it – consequentially triggering a wave of mass consolidation in the radio industry. However, broadcasters still used local marketing agreements to help transition acquired stations to their new owners.|$|E
5|$|The {{animated}} {{adaptation of}} the series was also popular in Japan, appearing in the top six of Japanese TV Rankings at various times. The television series ranked among the top twenty in polls conducted by anime magazine Animage from 1996 to 2001. It also placed better than twenty-third in polls for the top-one-hundred anime conducted by Japanese television network TV Asahi in 2005–06. The series received considerable <b>airtime</b> in China; {{it was the second}} most broadcast animation there in 2004. Several of the franchise's films were nominated for awards in their home country. The ninth film was nominated for the feature film category at the 5th Annual Tokyo Anime Awards, and the next five films were nominees for the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year in their respective years of release.|$|E
5|$|The seventh season {{saw another}} format change, as fighters had to compete to be {{official}} castmembers. Instead {{of the usual}} 16 fighters, the season had 32 fighters after Dana White claimed that {{he was tired of}} fighters coming onto the show for <b>airtime.</b> This season was coached by UFC Light Heavyweight champion Quinton Jackson and challenger Forrest Griffin, the first season's winner. The season's final was due to be competed between Amir Sadollah, who hadn't competed in a professional fight before the show, and Jesse Taylor. However, Taylor was kicked off the show after filming had completed, when he kicked the window out of a limosine in Las Vegas. His slot was taken by C.B. Dollaway who defeated Tim Credeur for the right, but Sadollah won in the final to become The Ultimate Fighter.|$|E
50|$|MoviePlex {{broadcasts}} {{its primary}} and multiplex channels on an Eastern Time Zone schedule. Because MoviePlex operates a singular broadcast feed that covers every U.S. time zone, {{the difference in}} local <b>airtimes</b> for a particular movie or program between two locations will be at most six hours. The premium film service Starz and Encore, which are both also owned by Starz Inc., operate as separate services - although subscribers to MoviePlex do not necessarily have to subscribe to {{either of the two}} sister services.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the service}} provider, Super Channel {{provides}} up to eight multiplex channels - four 24-hour multiplex channels, {{all of which are}} simulcast in both standard definition and high definition - as well as a subscription video-on-demand service (Super Channel On Demand). Super Channel broadcasts its primary channel and multiplex channels on an Eastern Time Zone schedule, operating a singular feed for all channels, this results in the difference in local <b>airtimes</b> for a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being three hours at most.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, The Children's Channel {{introduced}} a strand for toddlers and preschoolers called Tiny TCC, which aired every morning from 6am until 9am. This block was then transferred over to UK Living on 3 February 1997 and renamed Tiny Living with its <b>airtimes</b> being changed to 7:00-9:00 on weekdays, and 7:00-10:00 during the weekend. Following The Children's Channel's unexpected closedown of British and Irish operations on 3 April 1998 and full replacement by then-timeshared channel Trouble the next day, the strand was finally withdrawn in 2006.|$|R
25|$|The network plays a {{range of}} New Zealand music, giving {{promotion}} and <b>airtime</b> to Brooke Fraser, Benny Tipene, Lorde, and Avalanche City. However, it has been criticised for giving most of its <b>airtime</b> to American music.|$|E
25|$|The {{private channel}} Abaza TV, owned by Beslan Butba, also offered {{equal amounts of}} <b>airtime</b> to all candidates.|$|E
25|$|The storyline also {{allegedly}} centered {{too much}} on the McMahons, who were getting more <b>airtime</b> than the wrestlers.|$|E
5000|$|As {{it is one}} of a few PBS {{member state}} {{networks}} encompassing two time zones, KET's programming operates on an Eastern Time Zone schedule; in promos, online guides on the network's website and print advertisements, <b>airtimes</b> within the Central Time Zone (which covers {{the western part of the}} state) are identified secondarily, in the manner of the [...] "Eastern/Central" [...] scheduling references used by many national broadcast and cable networks. Most of the KET stations have callsigns beginning with [...] "WK", with the exception of Covington-licensed WCVN-TV.|$|R
50|$|Tr3s {{broadcasts}} on an Eastern Time schedule (with programs {{shown at}} earlier or later times {{depending on the}} location) and does not timeshift its programming for other U.S. time zones {{due to the lack}} of an additional feed for the Pacific Time Zone. As such, promos for Tr3s programs reference <b>airtimes</b> for both the Eastern and Pacific time zones (for example, the now-defunct Mi TRL, is promoted as airing on Mondays at 4:30 p.m. Eastern, and simultaneously airs at 1:30 p.m. in the Pacific Time Zone).|$|R
50|$|On September 21, 2009, all {{editions of}} CNN Today, Your World Today and World News were rebranded as World Report; another {{television}} {{series of the}} same name, World Report, was renamed as World View at the same time. Initially, there were multiple editions airing per day, at 0000, 0200, 0500, 0600, 0700, 0800, 0900, 1100, 1200, 1300 and 1700 (all times GMT). However, as CNN International's schedule evolved, these <b>airtimes</b> were reduced to weekend editions, and an Asian and European morning edition. Anna Coren and Pauline Chiou anchored Asian edition during these time.|$|R
