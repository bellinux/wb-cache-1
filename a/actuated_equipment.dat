Whether lightning strikes cage or cables running to equipment, current canceled or minimized in equipment and discharged into ground. Applicable to protection of scientific instruments, computers, radio transmitters and receivers, and power-switching equipment...|$|E
50|$|An {{electric}} actuator {{is powered by}} a motor that converts electrical energy into mechanical torque. The electrical energy is used to <b>actuate</b> <b>equipment</b> such as multi-turn valves. It is one of the cleanest and most readily available forms of actuator because it does not directly involve oil or other fossil fuels.|$|R
40|$|The {{technologies}} used in greenhouse {{production systems}} have developed considerably {{during the last}} decade. These improvements {{have taken place in}} several areas, such as the development of new building techniques and <b>actuating</b> <b>equipments,</b> modelling of the plant physiological processes and of the greenhouse climate, among many others. Nowadays, due to economic and environmental requirements, there is still a demand to improve the greenhouse climate management and control systems in order to optimise the production process. This paper addresses some of the software tools that are being implemented and tested with this purpose...|$|R

As stated in the summary, "this report reviews investigations to determine the fire hazard in coal mining when using flammable petroleum hydraulic oils to <b>actuate</b> mining <b>equipment</b> and summarizes research by the Bureau of Mines and industry on fire-resistant hydraulic fluids" (p. 1). This report includes tables, illustrations, and photographs...|$|R
40|$|Greenhouse {{construction}} and operation have developed considerably {{during the last}} decade, mainly in northern European countries. These improvements took place in several areas, such as {{the development of new}} building techniques and actuators or the modelling of plant physiological processes and greenhouse climate. Presently, due to economic and environmental requirements, there is still a demand to achieve an optimal management of the greenhouse environment, in order to increase the efficiency of the crop production process. From the greenhouse grower point of view it is intended to maximise the profits, which is a very difficult objective to achieve in practice. This is because growers must make many complex decisions. These decisions are related to the capital investments they have required, the establishment of tactical plans involving the selection of crops, or the use of manual labour, and, a crucial issue, on how to operate the <b>actuating</b> <b>equipments</b> in order to achieve the greenhouse environment dynamical optimisation from an economic return point of view. The {{purpose of this article is}} to present methods and software tools for automating an optimal decision process for controlling the greenhouse climate, to illustrate their potential and to point to the problems that remain...|$|R

This one drives, {{through a}} rack-pinion mechanism, a Fin Ray-type mechanism, {{with a view}} to mobilizing the injured palm. Unlike other rehabilitation equipments, the one presented in this paper, ensures the movement of both palm and fingers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the article}} is to analyze the {{experimental}} behavior of a rehabilitation equipment during a recovery program. It is known {{the high incidence of}} the human knee/ankle/hip dysfunctions. So, it had been conceived a pneumatic muscle <b>actuated</b> rehabilitation <b>equipment,</b> for rehabilitation of those types affections. It is presented the components and the experimental researches made considering that on the equipment is a 20 kilos load (considered as a human foot weight). The results of experiments shows the behaviour of the equipment: slider position, speed and acceleration in time â€“ under different commands...|$|R
50|$|A {{semi-automatic}} transmission (SAT) (also {{known as a}} clutchless manual transmission, automated manual transmission, trigger shift, flappy-paddle gear shift, or paddle-shift gearbox) is an automobile transmission that does not change gears automatically, but rather facilitates manual gear changes by dispensing {{with the need to}} press a clutch pedal {{at the same time as}} changing gears. It uses electronic sensors, pneumatics, processors and actuators to execute gear shifts on input from the driver or by a computer. This removes the need for a clutch pedal which the driver otherwise needs to depress before making a gear change, since the clutch itself is <b>actuated</b> by electronic <b>equipment</b> which can synchronise the timing and torque required to make quick, smooth gear shifts. The system was designed by automobile manufacturers to provide a better driving experience through fast overtaking maneuvers on highways. Some motorcycles also use a system with a conventional gearchange but without the need for manual clutch operation.|$|R
