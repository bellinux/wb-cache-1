25|$|Individuals with <b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia</b> have {{difficulty}} with naming. The patients may have difficulties naming certain words, linked by their grammatical type (e.g., difficulty naming verbs and not nouns) or by their semantic category (e.g., difficulty naming words relating to photography but nothing else) or a more general naming difficulty. Patients tend to produce grammatic, yet empty, speech. Auditory comprehension tends to be preserved. <b>Anomic</b> <b>aphasia</b> is the aphasial presentation of tumors in the language zone; it is the aphasial presentation of Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
25|$|The term <b>Anomic</b> <b>Aphasia</b> usually {{refers to}} {{patients}} whose only prevalent symptom is impaired word retrieval in speech and writing. Typically, the spontaneous speech {{of a person}} with <b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia</b> is fluent and grammatically correct but contains many word retrieval failures. These failures lead to unusual pauses, talking around the intended word, or substituting a different word for the intended word. <b>Anomic</b> <b>aphasia</b> is the mildest form of aphasia, indicating a likely possibility for better recovery. Patients with Broca’s aphasia may also have difficulty with word retrieval, or anomia. In addition, patients with Broca’s aphasia comprehend spoken and written language better than they can speak or write. These patients self-monitor, are aware of their communicative impairments, and frequently try to repeat or attempt repairs. The preceding factors discussed correlate with a good prognosis for patients with Broca’s aphasia. Many patients with an acute onset of Broca’s aphasia eventually progress to milder forms of aphasia, such as conduction or anomic.|$|E
25|$|Therapy for Expressive Aphasia (nonfluent) is beneficial, {{even for}} {{patients}} with severe nonfluent aphasia. A study conducted by Marangolo and co-workers (2013) administered conversational therapy to patients with severe nonfluent aphasia. The {{results of the study}} demonstrated {{a significant increase in the}} patient’s expressive language. The authors suggested that an intensive conversational therapy program should be considered {{for patients with}} moderately severe nonfluent aphasia in order to enhance the patient's quality of life and improve their language expression. In addition, although <b>Anomic</b> <b>Aphasia</b> is seen to be less severe than other aphasias, therapy is still imperative to help decrease the patient’s word finding deficits. A research study conducted by Harnish and co-workers (2014), provided intense treatment to patients with <b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia.</b> Results of the study concluded significant increases in the participant’s expressive language. These results suggest that an intensive intervention program for patients with <b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia</b> provides a surprisingly quick expressive language increase. Specifically, these patients relearned to correctly produce the problematic words after one to three hours of speech-language therapy.|$|E
40|$|Aphasia is {{a central}} {{language}} impairment with word finding and comprehension deficit and paraphasias. The highlights of the essential language tests and the classification based on a scorable assessment are presented. The clinical syndromes of Broca's, global, Wernicke, conduction, <b>anomic</b> and transcortical <b>aphasias</b> are detailed with definition, localization, and prognosis. Modality specific disorders associated with aphasic syndromes are discussed.

40|$|This study {{examined}} production and comprehension of nouns and verbs using the Northwestern Naming Battery (NNB), a new test {{designed to assess}} naming ability in individuals with stroke-induced or primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Scores derived from the NNB were also compared to scores from published, standardized tests to evaluate the NNB’s validity. Dissociations between word classes in production were observed for participants with stroke-induced <b>anomic</b> and Broca’s <b>aphasia</b> with agrammatism and individuals with logopenic and agrammatic variants of PPA, with the two agrammatic groups showing greater impairment for verb compared to noun naming. Clinical and theoretical implications will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Objective: {{this study}} compares the {{performance}} of two groups of participants with and without <b>aphasia</b> <b>anomic</b> in a lexical decision tasks (LDT) and spelling, {{in relation to the}} effect of the variables of word frequency and syllable. Materials and methods: a prospective study with a 2 x 2 x 2 design, which administered the LDT, in which each she/he had to decide if it was a real Spanish word or not, pressing one of two keys. To the task of spelling, they had to spell orally each of words presented auditorily. Results: It was found that in the LTD, the experimental group made more errors in the high-frequency stimuli syllable while the control group had more errors in the low-frequency syllables. In terms of reaction times was evident that the experimental group took longer to solve the task than the control group. The spelling task performance showed no difference in groups or conditions (lexical frequency and syllable). Conclusions: similar than other researches in normalized population, {{the results of this study}} demonstrate the effect of lexical frequency facilitation and inhibition that generates high syllable frequency...|$|R
25|$|However, no such broad-based {{grouping}} {{has proven}} fully adequate. There {{is a huge}} variation among patients within the same broad grouping, and aphasias can be highly selective. For instance, patients with naming deficits (<b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia)</b> might show an inability only for naming buildings, or people, or colors.|$|E
25|$|An {{occasional}} tip-of-the-tongue {{state is}} normal {{for people of}} all ages. TOT becomes more frequent as people age. TOT is only a medical condition when it becomes frequent enough to interfere with learning or daily life. This disorder is called <b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia</b> when acquired by brain damage, usually from a head injury, stroke, or dementia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anomic</b> <b>aphasia</b> is the {{inability}} to recall words and names and is a common symptom of patients with Aphasia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Research has been conducted {{to find out how}} these particular diseases affect TOTs in these individuals. In a study by Beeson, Holland, and Murray (1997), participants with Alzheimer's disease and three classic aphasic syndromes (Broca’s, anomic, and conduction aphasia) were instructed to name famous people. Those with <b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia</b> showed to be superior to the other groups in their ability to naming famous people that were presented. This finding was expected as the group has relatively mild aphasia. However, the Broca’s conduction and AD groups did not differ in immediate or delayed naming of famous faces. All of the groups provided some basic identifying semantic information for {{at least half of the}} items presented, suggesting a fair number of items potentially in TOT. Conduction and Broca’s groups showed strongest evidence of TOT, performing better than the other groups in identification of initial letters.|$|E
2500|$|Recent {{classification}} schemes adopting this approach, {{such as the}} [...] "Boston-Neoclassical Model", also group these classical aphasia subtypes {{into two}} larger classes: the nonfluent aphasias (which encompasses Broca's aphasia and transcortical motor aphasia) and the fluent aphasias (which encompasses Wernicke's aphasia, conduction aphasia and transcortical sensory aphasia). These schemes also identify several further aphasia subtypes, including: <b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia,</b> which {{is characterized by a}} selective difficulty finding the names for things; and global aphasia, where both expression and comprehension of speech are severely compromised.|$|E

[...] The person struggles {{to find the right}} words for speaking and writing. Subjects tend to use circumulations, in which they speak around the word they can not find, to make up for their loss. People also with <b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia</b> tend to know how to use an object, but rather can not name the aforementioned object.

50|$|<b>Anomic</b> <b>aphasia</b> (anomia) {{is a type}} of aphasia {{characterized}} by problems recalling words, names, and numbers. Speech is fluent and receptive language is not impaired in someone with <b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia.</b> Subjects often use circumlocutions (speaking in a roundabout way) in order to avoid a name they cannot recall or to express a certain word they cannot remember. Sometimes the subject can recall the name when given clues. Additionally, patients are able to speak with correct grammar; the main problem is finding the appropriate word to identify an object or person.|$|E

5000|$|New {{data has}} shown that {{although}} the arcuate fascicles' main function does not include connecting Wernicke's area and Broca's area, damage to the tract does create speech problems because the speech comprehension and speech production areas are connected by this tract.

However, in left-handed people the language center is about 60% in the left hemisphere; thus, <b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia</b> can occur with damage to the right hemisphere in left-handed people.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the main}} causes are not {{specifically}} known, many {{researchers have found}} factors contributing to <b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia.</b> It is known that people with damage to the left hemisphere of the brain {{are more likely to}} have <b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia.</b> Broca's area, the speech production center in the brain, was linked to being the source for speech execution problems, with the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), now commonly used to study anomic patients. Other experts believe that damage to Wernicke's area, which is the speech comprehension area of the brain, is connected to anomia because the patients cannot comprehend the words that they are hearing.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to first do a hearing test, in case the patient cannot clearly hear the words or sentences needed in the speech repetition test. In the speech tests, the person is asked to repeat a sentence with common words; if the person cannot identify the word but {{he or she can}} describe it, then the person is highly likely to have <b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia.</b> However, to be completely sure, the test is given while a test subject is in an fMRI scanner, and the exact location of the lesions and areas activated by speech are pinpointed. Few simpler or cheaper options are available, so lesion mapping and speech repetition tests are the main ways of diagnosing <b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 1911, Potzl and Redlich {{reported}} a 58-year-old female patient with bilateral damage to her posterior brain.

50|$|While not a disorder, {{a common}} {{temporary}} failure of word retrieval from memory is the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon. Sufferers of <b>Anomic</b> <b>aphasia</b> (also called Nominal aphasia or Anomia), however, do experience the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon {{on an ongoing}} basis due to damage to the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain.|$|E
50|$|An {{occasional}} tip-of-the-tongue {{state is}} normal {{for people of}} all ages. TOT becomes more frequent as people age. TOT is only a medical condition when it becomes frequent enough to interfere with learning or daily life.

50|$|The {{best way}} to see if <b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia</b> has {{developed}} is by using verbal as well as imaging tests. The {{combination of the two}} tests seem to be most effective, since either test done alone may give false positives or false negatives. For example, the verbal test is used {{to see if there is}} a speech disorder, and whether it is a problem in speech production or in comprehension. Patients with Alzheimer's disease have speech problems that are linked to dementia or progressive aphasias which can include anomia. The imaging test, mostly done using MRI scans, is ideal for lesion mapping or viewing deterioration in the brain. However, imaging cannot diagnose anomia on its own because the lesions may not be located deep enough to damage the white matter or damage the arcuate fasciculus. However, <b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia</b> is very difficult to associate with a specific lesion location in the brain. Therefore, the combination of speech tests and imaging tests has the highest sensitivity and specificity.|$|E
50|$|Language {{disturbances}} in delirium include <b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia,</b> paraphasias, impaired comprehension, agraphia, and word-finding difficulties. Incoherent or illogical / rambling conversation is reported commonly. Disorganised thinking includes tangentiality, circumstantiality and a proneness to loose associations between elements of thought {{which results in}} speech that often makes limited sense with multiple apparent irrelevancies. This aspect of delirium is common but often difficult for non-experts to assess reliably.|$|E
50|$|Research on {{children}} with anomia {{has indicated that}} children who undergo treatment are, for the most part, able to gain back normal language abilities, aided by brain plasticity. However, longitudinal research {{on children}} with <b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia</b> due to head injury shows that even several years after the injury, some signs of deficient word retrieval are still observed. These remaining symptoms can sometimes cause academic difficulties later on.|$|E
50|$|This {{disorder}} may {{be extremely}} frustrating {{for people with}} and without the disorder. Although the person with <b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia</b> may know the specific word, {{they may not be}} able to recall it and this can be very difficult for everyone in the conversation. However, it is important to be patient and work with the person so that he or she gains confidence with his or her speech. Positive reinforcements are helpful.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anomic</b> <b>aphasia,</b> aphasia (expressive + {{receptive}} aphasia) and Alzheimer's {{disease can}} all affect recalling or retrieving words. Anomia renders a person completely unable to name familiar objects, places and people, a involves specific naming difficulties; sufferers of anomia have difficulties recalling words. Anomia is a lesser level of dysfunction, a severe {{form of the}} [...] "tip-of-the-tongue" [...] phenomenon where the brain cannot recall the desired word. Stroke, head trauma and brain tumors can cause anomia.|$|E
5000|$|Validity: A {{discriminant}} analysis comparing [...] "unambiguous exemplars {{of a single}} syndrome" [...] was carried out. Thus, unambiguous cases of Broca’s aphasia, Wernicke’s aphasia, conduction aphasia, and <b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia</b> were selected. Ten variables were selected on the assumption of providing the most useful data. From these, five variables were selected for the {{discriminant analysis}} (body part identification, repetition of high probability sentences, verbal paraphasias, articulatory agility rating, and automated sentence rating). This classification yielded no misclassifications.|$|E
5000|$|Recent {{classification}} schemes adopting this approach, {{such as the}} [...] "Boston-Neoclassical Model", also group these classical aphasia subtypes {{into two}} larger classes: the nonfluent aphasias (which encompasses Broca's aphasia and transcortical motor aphasia) and the fluent aphasias (which encompasses Wernicke's aphasia, conduction aphasia and transcortical sensory aphasia). These schemes also identify several further aphasia subtypes, including: <b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia,</b> which {{is characterized by a}} selective difficulty finding the names for things; and global aphasia, where both expression and comprehension of speech are severely compromised.|$|E
50|$|Other {{methods in}} {{treating}} <b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia</b> include Circumlocution Induced Naming therapy (CIN), wherein the patient uses circumlocution {{to assist with}} his or her naming rather than just being told to name the item pictured after given some sort of cue. Results suggest that the patient does better in properly naming objects when undergoing this therapy because CIN strengthens the weakened link between semantics and phonology for patients with anomia, since they often know what an object is used for but cannot verbally name it.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there are}} not many {{literary}} cases about <b>anomic</b> <b>aphasia,</b> there are many non-fiction books about living with aphasia. One of them is The Man Who Lost His Language by Sheila Hale. It is the story of Sheila Hale's husband, John Hale, a scholar who suffered a stroke and lost speech formation abilities. In her book, Sheila Hale also explains the symptoms and mechanics behind aphasia and speech formation. She adds the emotional components of dealing with a person with aphasia and how to be patient with the speech and communication.|$|E
