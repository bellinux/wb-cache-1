30|$|The stage design {{strength}} ratio {{as a percentage}} is determined using Eq.  1 based on {{the difference between the}} design relative strength, S(T), estimated for a given design load <b>applications</b> <b>level,</b> W(T), and the stage relative strength, S(t), associated with a specified stage load applications value, W(t), that is {{less than or equal to}} the design load <b>applications</b> <b>level,</b> W(T). The design relative strength, S(T), is constant for a given design load <b>applications</b> <b>level,</b> W(T), while the stage relative strength, S(t), is variable depending on the value of the stage load applications, W(t). The S(T) represents the relative strength required for a design load <b>applications</b> <b>level,</b> W(T), corresponding to a design period of (T) years. Whereas, the S(t) denotes the relative strength needed for a stage period of (t) years that is less than or equal to the design period (T). The stage period (t) starts from time zero and not from an intermediate time as typically done in a conventional two-stage design approach. Therefore, the S(t) takes on the value of zero when the stage period (t) is set equal to zero which causes the stage {{design strength}} ratio, DS(t), to become equal to 100 % according to Eq.  1.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the design}} {{considerations}} of RTP is to carry a range of multimedia formats and allow new formats without revising the RTP standard. The design of RTP {{is based on the}} architectural principle known as <b>application</b> <b>level</b> framing (ALF). The information required by a specific application's needs is not included in the generic RTP header, but is instead provided through RTP profiles and payload formats. For each class of application (e.g., audio, video), RTP defines a profile and one or more associated payload formats. A complete specification of RTP for a particular application usage requires profile and payload format specifications.|$|E
30|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to investigate a}} possible relationship between the accelerated pavement deterioration rates and pavement design strength using a two-stage design analysis approach. The deployed approach applies a two-stage solution to the three popular design methods of flexible pavement to yield pavement designs using stage load applications values specified for each investigated design load <b>applications</b> <b>level.</b> The resulting two-stage pavement designs are then used to obtain an indicator called the stage design strength ratio (percentage) defined as {{the ratio of the}} relative strength change to the design relative strength. The relative strength change is the difference between the design relative strength associated with a design load <b>applications</b> <b>level</b> and stage relative strength associated with a stage load applications value that is {{less than or equal to}} the design load <b>applications</b> <b>level.</b> It basically provides a measure of strength difference resulting from two pavement designs obtained using two distinct loading conditions. Then, the derived values of stage design strength ratio are compared to the deployed stage load applications values.|$|R

The rice varieties were Lalat of medium duration (120 days) type and Swarna of long duration (150 days) type. Correlation between N <b>application</b> <b>levels</b> and grain yield determined the optimum grain yield of the variety Lalat and Swrana as 5024 and 6427 kg ha - 1, respectively, under the corresponding N <b>application</b> <b>levels</b> of 105 and 155 kg N ha - 1. A significant and positive correlation was observed between flag leaf N content and SPAD value (R 2 ≈ 0. 80) and SPAD value at different growth stages and grain yield for both the varieties. The average SPAD value for optimum grain yield production was 35. 4 and 40. 1 for Lalat and Swarna, respectively. The desired SPAD values at critical growth stages were determined for optimum grain yield production of both the varieties...|$|R
