[...] On 21 September 2006, the government announced they would invest up to $600 million in broadband infrastructure projects in rural, regional and remote Australia under this program. Applications for funding were open until 30 November. On 18 June 2007, in the lead up to a federal election, OPEL Networks was announced as the sole successful bidder, receiving the entire $600 million in funding under the program, {{as well as an}} additional allocation of $358 million.

Frustrated by the council's refusal to pay, and in debt from the costs of the device's construction, Turriano entered into another agreement, underwritten by the Crown, to build a second device for the supply of the city. However, it was agreed that this time he and his heirs would retain the rights for the operation. This second version was completed in 1581, and although the Crown paid the costs of construction, Turriano was unable to cover the costs of maintenance and was forced to give up control of the machine to the city.

40|$|The {{failure of}} the more recent {{attempts}} to discriminate between alternative explanation approaches of wages above the collectively <b>agreed</b> <b>level</b> (market, negotiation, and efficiency wage approach) (cf. last Bellman/Kohaut 1995 in this journal) is probably {{not the result of}} a data deficit, but of a theory deficit. In this article an attempt is made to reduce this theory deficit. Anew explanation approach is developed, the approach of anticipated or implied negotiations, in which it is assumed that that the employer anticipates the result of a negotiation with the employee in order to save the costs of an argument with him/her. In contrast to the approach of a collective 'second wage round' at company level, however, individual negotiations are assumed. The degree to which wages are paid above the collectively <b>agreed</b> <b>level</b> depends in the result both on a number of company-specific factors and on market and institutional factors. The conclusions are surprisingly consistent with the stylized facts of the labour market - even though the 'works council' was completely neglected as an institution.

40|$|In {{this chapter}} {{we present a}} survey of {{research}} work related to the semantic modelling of security, semantic SLA modelling, and {{the current state of}} the art in SLA-based system governance. Based on this survey, and after observing the essential aspects needed to semantically model an SLA, we first propose a semantic model of resource dependability. This model can be used to semantically encode in SLA the service commitments (to customers) and resource capacity (from suppliers) in terms of usage, performance, and other QoS characteristics that represent non-functional properties. On the basis of this model, we propose a flexible approach to SLA-based system governance that allows for elastic provisioning of resources (by autonomic processes) that meet NFP requirements. This approach can be used to monitor and manage services such that they meet (and continue to meet) <b>agreed</b> <b>levels</b> of QoS...|$|E
