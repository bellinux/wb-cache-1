25|$|One of {{the most}} notorious death squads {{operating}} during this period was the MANO, also known as the Mano Blanca ("White Hand"); initially formed by the MLN as a paramilitary front in June 1966 to prevent President Méndez Montenegro from taking office, the MANO was quickly taken over by the military and incorporated into the state's counter-terror apparatus. The MANO – while being the only death squad formed <b>autonomously</b> <b>from</b> the government – had a largely military membership, and received substantial funding from wealthy landowners. The MANO also received information from military intelligence through La Regional, with which it was linked to the Army General Staff and all of the main security forces.|$|E

The group advised and trained Vietnamese personnel in the disciplines of public administration, police administration, and economics. MSUG worked <b>autonomously</b> <b>from</b> most U.S. government agencies, had unmatched access to the presidency, and even assisted in writing the country's new constitution. Several of its proposals were undertaken by the Vietnamese government and had positive results {{for the people of}} Vietnam. However, the group had limited influence on Diệm's decision-making and on the course of events in Vietnam, and publications by dissatisfied faculty led to Diệm's termination of the contract.|$|E

Sports Weekly added coverage of NASCAR on February 15, 2006, lasting only during that year's race season; and added coverage of NCAA college football on August 8, 2007.

500|$|Close-in {{anti-aircraft}} {{defense would}} have been provided by 40mm and 20mm guns. Arguably the best light anti-aircraft gun of the Second World War, the 40mm Bofors was used for air defense both on land and at sea {{by many of the}} countries involved, including the Americans, British, Dutch, Japanese, and Swedish. Produced in the early 1930s, it first entered service with the Royal Netherlands Navy when the cruisers Java and Sumatra were refitted in 1934–35. Before the Second World War, Hazemeyer, a Dutch subsidiary of the German company Siemens & Halske, had devised [...] "a very advanced triaxial mounting together with a tachymetric control system" [...] for the 40mm gun. When the Netherlands fell in 1940, this was brought to the U.K. aboard the minesweeper Willem van der Zaan, where it was copied and put into service as the British MarkIV twin mount. The description of the proposed fire control mechanism for the 1047s, discussed on 6 November 1939, mentions that the 40mm weapons were [...] "to be controlled <b>autonomously</b> <b>from</b> the gun positions"; this seems to describe Hazemeyer's system, but no direct link is made in sources.|$|E

The Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) and the South African Communist Party, the latter a major ally of the ruling ANC, [...] issued strong statements condemning the campaign and labelling it 'violent' and, 'anarchist' and reactionary'. AbM responded by saying that their support for road blockades was not violent and that [...] "We have never called for violence. Violence is harm to human beings. Blockading a road is not violence."

After the strike by AbM Western Cape, there were some protests in TR section of Khayelitsha in which vehicles were damaged. AbM WC ascribed these protests to the ANC Youth League as did Helen Zille and the Youth League itself.

Basayev said his Riyadus-Salikhin [...] "martyr battalion" [...] had carried out the attack and also claimed responsibility for a series of terrorist bombings in Russia in the weeks before Beslan crisis. He said that he originally planned to seize at least one school in either Moscow or Saint Petersburg, but lack of funds forced him to pick North Ossetia, [...] "the Russian garrison in the North Caucasus". Basayev blamed the Russian authorities for [...] "a terrible tragedy" [...] in Beslan. Basayev claimed that he had miscalculated the Kremlin's determination to end the crisis by all means possible. He said he was [...] "cruelly mistaken" [...] and that he was [...] "not delighted by what happened there", but also added to be [...] "planning more Beslan-type operations in the future because we are forced to do so." [...] However, it was the last major act of terrorism in Russia until 2009, as Basayev was soon persuaded to give up indiscriminate attacks by the new rebel leader Abdul-Halim Sadulayev, who made Basayev his second-in-command but banned hostage taking, kidnapping for ransom, and operations specifically targeting civilians.|$|E
