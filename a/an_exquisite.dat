They unknowingly enter a magical world that Chihiro's father insists on exploring. While Chihiro's parents eat like pigs at an empty restaurant stall, Chihiro finds <b>an</b> <b>exquisite</b> bathhouse and meets a young boy named Haku who warns her to return across the river before sunset. However, Chihiro discovers too late that her parents have turned into pigs and she is unable to cross the flooded river, becoming trapped in the spirit world.|$|E
5|$|When a {{musician}} hears Bix's solo on 'Singing the Blues', he becomes aware after two bars that the soloist {{knows exactly what}} he is doing and that he has <b>an</b> <b>exquisite</b> sense of discord and resolution. He knows also that this player is endowed with the rarest jazz gift of all, a sense of form which lends to an improvised performance a coherence which no amount of teaching can produce. The listening musician, whatever his generation or his style, recognizes Bix as a modern, modernism being not a style but an attitude.|$|E

25|$|Translated into {{terms of}} ancient criticism, {{he became the}} model of the plain style (: genus tenue or subtile). Greek and then Roman critics {{distinguished}} three styles of rhetorical composition—the grand (or elaborate), the plain and the middle, the plain being nearest to the language of daily life. Greek rhetoric began in the grand style; then Lysias set <b>an</b> <b>exquisite</b> pattern of the plain; and Demosthenes might be considered as having effected an almost ideal compromise.|$|E
25|$|The conquests {{destroyed}} little: {{what they}} did suppress were imperial rivalries and sectarian bloodletting among the newly subjected population. The Muslims tolerated Christianity, but they disestablished it; henceforward Christian life and liturgy, its endowments, politics and theology, would be a private and not a public affair. By <b>an</b> <b>exquisite</b> irony, Islam reduced the status of Christians to that which the Christians had earlier thrust upon the Jews, with one difference. The reduction in Christian status was merely judicial; it was unaccompanied by either systematic persecution or a blood lust, and generally, though not elsewhere and at all times, unmarred by vexatious behavior.|$|E
25|$|After {{failing to}} score against Fulham, van Persie scored again for Arsenal, this time against Wigan Athletic {{to make the}} score 4–0 to Arsenal on 3 December 2011. He then added to his tally with the only goal of the game against Everton, <b>an</b> <b>exquisite</b> volley from an Alex Song long ball. The {{following}} match, versus Aston Villa, saw him score a penalty and provide an assist. Van Persie's final goal of the 2011 calendar year came in Arsenal's one-goal win over Queens Park Rangers {{on the last day}} of the year. The goal took his tally for the year to 35 goals, one short of Alan Shearer's Premier League record.|$|E

25|$|Gaudiya Vaishnava, as {{the name}} suggests, usually refers to the region of Bengal. Early Bengali {{literature}} gives a vivid description of the depiction and evolution of understanding of Radha and Krishna. It is believed, however, {{that the source of}} Jayadeva Goswamis heroine in his poem Gita Govinda remains a puzzle of the Sanskrit Literature. At the same time there are well documented references to works earlier than Gita Govinda, which some count to be more than twenty. The figure of Radha {{is one of the most}} elusive in the literature of Sanskrit; she is described only in a few selected passages of Prakrit or Sanskrit poetry, a few inscriptions and a few works on grammar, poetry and drama. Jayadeva has referred to them and created <b>an</b> <b>exquisite</b> lyrical poem of passionate devotion in the twelfth century, and from this poetic beginning a huge movement specific to Bengal began.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half Liverpool drew level in the 57th minute when he latched onto a defence {{splitting}} pass from Jan Mølby to round Everton goalkeeper Bobby Mimms and slot the ball into an empty net. Six minutes later, Mølby was again {{at the heart of}} another attack. Picking the ball up inside the Everton penalty area, he drilled a cross for Craig Johnston to score. Liverpool were now 2–1 up, but the game was in the balance until the 84th minute, when Ronnie Whelan led another attack. With the game stretched, he picked the ball up and drove towards the edge of the Everton area. Dalglish made a run across his path into space, but Whelan used it as a dummy and clipped <b>an</b> <b>exquisite</b> ball over three Everton defenders into the path of Rush who, from the angle of the six-yard area, thumped the ball past Mimms, knocking over a camera in the process. Liverpool held on to win 3–1 and completed the first (and so far only) League and FA Cup double in the club's history. Rush added the Man of the Match award to his winner's medal. However, the ban on English clubs in European competition was continued, and Rush was unable to have a crack of winning another European Cup in 1986–87.|$|E

25|$|The Akkadian Ekur {{reconstruction}} {{project was}} {{documented in the}} Ekur archive; a number of administrative tablets found under the Ur Gur platform or pavement level. These were found by an expedition from the University of Pennsylvania between 1889 and 1900, led by John Punnett Peters, John Henry Haynes, and Hermann Volrath Hilprecht. The tablets detail records of the building work and furnishings of the temple under Naram-Sin and Shar-Kali-Sharri. These tablets describe the walls featuring statues of four gold bison. The courtyard was paved with a pattern of red and yellow bricks. The main entrance to the Ekur was adorned with two copper lahmu-figures with golden faces. These obscure figures held emblem-poles on either side. Two figures of large, winged, copper dragons guarded the gateway, their roaring mouths inlaid with gold. The doors were studded with copper and gold with heavy bolts resembling either dragons or water buffalo. The interior likely featured <b>an</b> <b>exquisite,</b> carved wooden decorations, panelling and furniture. Inner shrines had doors, which were also built with golden faced lahmu-figures either side along {{with a number of}} votive statues plated with gold. Around twenty nine kilograms of gold was used making one hundred moon crescents and one hundred sun discs used in the decorations. Two hundred kilograms of silver were used in the construction of a single shrine. Interestingly, no records of any personal adornments or jewellery were ever found in the Ekur.|$|E
25|$|After Raymond's few excursions, the Burgess Shale faded {{somewhat}} into obscurity. Walcott's third wife, Mary Vaux, discouraged {{access to}} the collections, which gathered dust on high shelves in the Smithsonian Institution. Harry Whittington, then of Harvard University, was to prove the catalyst that renewed interest in the site. As he showed a visiting trilobite expert around Raymond's collections, {{the necessity of a}} restudy was pointed out to Whittington, who proceeded to lobby the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) to revisit the locality. They did, and as a leading authority on trilobites, Whittington was the logical choice to head the palaeontological investigations in the arthropod-rich Shale. In the company of Jim Aitken and Bill Fritz, he led a GSC reconnaissance expedition in 1966; fellow trilobitologist David Bruton joined the crew the next year as they went out to quarry in force. Dynamite was used in only the smallest quantities, with closely spaced drill holes used to separate large blocks of rock, and large slabs were collected systematically from the Walcott and Raymond quarries. These were labelled with their stratigraphic level, helicoptered from the mountain face, and returned to Whittington's base at the Sedgwick Museum in Cambridge for further study. The 1967 operation resulted in the description of new animals, including the earliest known crinoid and a complete Anomalocaris. Initially, detailed descriptions were made {{of some of the most}} common arthropod-like organisms: Marrella, Sidneyia and Burgessia. These redescriptions were slow and laborious, making extensive use of the camera lucida technique for microscope drawing, with papers based extensively around detailed drawing of the fossil specimens. It soon became clear that the Burgess Shale was even more exceptional than previously thought - soft tissue was preserved to <b>an</b> <b>exquisite</b> quality, allowing insights into early life that had never before been dreamed of, and preserving a range of non-mineralising taxa which are otherwise invisible in the fossil record. With an overwhelmingly diverse fauna in need of cataloguing, Harry Whittington set his two new graduate students to the task, assigning Derek Briggs and Simon Conway Morris the arthropods and 'worms', respectively. This work began to lift the veil on an unexpectedly diverse ecosystem, with almost as much variety as seen in the modern oceans - the old theory that Cambrian life was simple, straightforwards and slightly dull disintegrated further with each new fossil described. This view was reinforced with the identification of other Burgess Shale-type deposits elsewhere in the world, a search for which was triggered by the discovery of the Chengjiang and Sirius Passet lagerstätten in 1984.|$|E

500|$|Rider Haggard's writing {{style was}} the source of much {{criticism}} in reviews of She and his other works. His harshest critic was Augustus Moore, who wrote [...] "God help English literature when English people lay aside their Waverley novels, and the works of Defoe, Swift, Thackeray, Charlotte Brontë, George Eliot, and even Charles Reade for the penny dreadfuls of Mr Haggard"; adding, [...] "The man who could write 'he spoke to She' can have no ear at all". A more common sentiment was expressed by the review of She in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine: [...] "Mr. Rider Haggard is not <b>an</b> <b>exquisite</b> workman like Mr. [...] Stevenson, but he {{has a great deal of}} power in his way, and rougher qualities which are more likely, perhaps, to 'take the town' than skill more delicate".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{also drew}} {{attention}} to {{other aspects of the}} film. Writing for The Sydney Morning Herald, Sandra Hall criticised Wright's attention to realism for being [...] "careless with the customs and conventions that were {{part of the fabric of}} Austen's world." [...] In another review, Time Out magazine lamented the absence of Austen's [...] "brilliant sense of irony", remarking that the film's [...] "romantic melodrama's played up at the expense of her razor-sharp wit." [...] More positively, Derek Elley of Variety magazine praised Wright and Moggach for [...] "extracting the youthful essence" [...] of the novel while also [...] "providing a richly detailed setting" [...] under Greenwood and Durran's supervision. Equally pleased with the film was the San Francisco Chronicles Ruthe Stein, who wrote that Wright made a [...] "spectacular feature film debut" [...] that is [...] "creatively reimagined and sublimely entertaining". Claudia Puig of USA Today called it [...] "a stellar adaptation, bewitching the viewer completely and incandescently with <b>an</b> <b>exquisite</b> blend of emotion and wit." ...|$|E
500|$|Other artists {{employed}} symbolism {{in a more}} prosaic manner, despite van Eyck's {{great influence}} on both his contemporaries and later artists. Campin showed a clear separation between spiritual and earthly realms; unlike van Eyck, he did not employ a programme of concealed symbolism. Campin's symbols do not alter {{the sense of the}} real; in his paintings a domestic scene is no more complicated than a one showing religious iconography, but one the viewer would recognise and understand. Van der Weyden's symbolism was far more nuanced than Campin's but not as dense as van Eyck's. According to Harbison, van der Weyden incorporated his symbols so carefully, and in such <b>an</b> <b>exquisite</b> manner, that [...] "Neither the mystical union that results in his work, nor his reality itself for that matter, seems capable of being rationally analyzed, explained or reconstructed." [...] His treatment of architectural details, niches, colour and space is presented in such an inexplicable manner that [...] "the particular objects or people we see before us have suddenly, jarringly, become symbols with religious truth".|$|E
