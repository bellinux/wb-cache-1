40|$|SummaryRisk {{perception}} and psychological concerns are relevant for understanding how people view Lyme disease. This study investigates the four separate outcomes of susceptibility, likelihood to be diagnosed, worry, <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> for contracting Lyme disease. University students (n= 713) were surveyed about demographics, perceived health, Lyme disease knowledge, Lyme disease preventive behaviors, Lyme disease history, and Lyme disease miscellaneous variables. We {{found that women}} were associated with increased susceptibility <b>and</b> <b>fear.</b> Asian/Asian-American race/ethnicity was associated with increased worry <b>and</b> <b>fear.</b> Perceived good health was associated with increased likelihood to be diagnosed, worry, <b>and</b> <b>fear.</b> Correct knowledge was associated with increased susceptibility and likelihood to be diagnosed. Those who typically {{spend a lot of}} time outdoors were associated with increased susceptibility, likelihood to be diagnosed, worry, <b>and</b> <b>fear.</b> In conclusion, healthcare providers and public health campaigns should address susceptibility, likelihood to be diagnosed, worry, <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> about Lyme disease, and should particularly target women and Asians/Asian-Americans to address any possible misconceptions and/or offer effective coping strategies...|$|R
40|$|Coronary {{angiography}} is used {{to visualize}} coronary arteries and to diagnose coronary artery diseases. After the examination a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can be performed as treatment. This examination can cause anxiety <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> among patients which may cause physical symptoms such as increased heart rate and blood pressure that can have {{negative effect on the}} examination and the possible intervention. The radiographer has primary responsibility for patient care during the examination. In order to provide the most optimal care to patients, the radiographer has to have knowledge of the underlying causes to anxiety <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> related to coronary angiography. The aim of this literature review was to compile knowledge that describes factors affecting patients’ experiences of anxiety <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> before a coronary angiography with or without PCI. The study was performed as a literature review. Eleven scientific articles were reviewed, analyzed and the results were presented in categories. Five categories that describe factors affecting patients experience of anxiety <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> were identified: Socio-demographic factors, Previous experience of coronary angiography or PCI, The impact of information on the experience of anxiety <b>and</b> <b>fear,</b> Experience of anxiety <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> related to the examination situation <b>and</b> Anxiety <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> related to the examinations impact on the patients everyday life and future.

40|$|Children {{undergoing}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging examination frequently experience anxiety <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> before <b>and</b> during the scanning.

The interventions consisted of three activities: a clown show, dog interaction and live music. The emotional status (anxiety <b>and</b> <b>fear)</b> of the children was evaluated before and after the activities through a rating scale questionnaire. The results showed that the activities had high effectiveness in reducing the level of anxiety <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> decreased the need for sedation in the experimental group compared to the control group. This approach proved to be a positive patient experience, helping to alleviate children’s anxiety <b>and</b> <b>fear,</b> decreasing the need for sedation, and was cost-effective...|$|R

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this {{research}} was to investigate the relationship between worry, intolerance of uncertainty, <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> of anxiety in a community sample of adolescents. Study 1 examined the association between adolescent worry, intolerance of uncertainty, <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> of anxiety (N = 258). The results showed that intolerance of uncertainty <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> of anxiety were strongly, uniquely, and specifically related to adolescent worry above and beyond shared variance with gender, depression, and trait anxiety. The interaction between intolerance of uncertainty <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> of anxiety did not significantly predict worry above their separate and unique effects. Study 2 sought to delineate the normative adolescent trajectories of worry, intolerance of uncertainty, <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> of anxiety over time, and explored the longitudinal nature of the associations between worry and intolerance of uncertainty, and between worry <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> of anxiety (N = 338). Data were collected from each participant twice a year for five years. The findings revealed modest, concave upward (i. e. U-shaped) trajectories for adolescent worry, intolerance of uncertainty, <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> of anxiety over the 10 assessment points. Gender differences in these trajectories were observed, with girls reporting more worry <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> of anxiety than boys across the study period. Unexpectedly, intolerance of uncertainty increased between the midpoint and endpoint of the study for girls, but not for boys. Support was found for a bidirectional and reciprocal relationship between adolescent worry and intolerance of uncertainty, with change in one partially mediating change in the other, even when controlling for depression and trait anxiety. Conversely, adolescent worry <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> of anxiety showed a predominantly unidirectional relationship, with change in worry showing a stronger mediational effect on change in fear of anxiety than vice versa, a result which remained once the variance with depression and trait anxiety was partialled out. Overall, the findings highlight the important role of cognitive processes, such as intolerance of uncertainty <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> of anxiety, in our understanding of adolescent worry. These findings have important implications for our understanding of worry during this critical period of development...|$|R
