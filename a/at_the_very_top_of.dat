5|$|Above {{the central}} figure shines a single small star <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the picture, serving {{as a symbol of}} further hope beyond that of {{the central figure}} herself. The {{distance}} of the star from the central figure, {{and the fact that it}} is outside her field of vision even were she not blindfolded, suggests an ambiguity. It provides an uplifting message to the viewer that things are not as bad for the central character as she believes, and introduces a further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{reaching}} the Emerald City (an analogue of the real-life World Trade Center plaza), the quintet gains passage {{into the city}} because of Dorothy's ownership of the silver slippers; they marvel at the spectacle {{of the city and}} its sophisticated, fashion forward dancers. They are granted an audience with the Wiz (Richard Pryor), who lives <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the Towers. He appears to them as a giant fire-breathing metallic head. He will only grant their wishes if they kill the sister of the Wicked Witch of the East, Evillene (Mabel King), the Wicked Witch of the West, who runs a sweatshop in the underground sewers of Oz. Before they can reach her domain, Evillene learns of their quest to kill her and sends out the Flying Monkeys (a motorcycle gang) to kidnap them.|$|E
5|$|One-thousand years ago, the nomadic Timbisha (formerly called Shoshone {{and also}} known as Panamint or Koso) moved into the area and hunted game and {{gathered}} mesquite beans along with pinyon pine nuts. Because of the wide altitude differential between the valley bottom and the mountain ridges, especially on the west, the Timbisha practiced a vertical migration pattern. Their winter camps were located near water sources in the valley bottoms. As {{the spring and summer}} progressed and the weather warmed, grasses and other plant food sources ripened at progressively higher altitudes. November found them <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the mountain ridges where they harvested pine nuts before moving back to the valley bottom for winter.|$|E

5|$|The early 2000s {{were seen}} as a time of {{transition}} in tennis, with older players retiring and a few players breaking through <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the game. Roger Federer had first played on the ATP Tour aged 17 in 1998, finishing his first full ATP season the following year before finishing 2002 ranked sixth in the world, his first year-end ranking in the top 8. His breakthrough came in 2003 when {{he won his first}} Grand Slam tournament, and finished the year as world number 2 behind Andy Roddick. The following two years, he almost completely dominated, winning five of eight majors and losing just ten matches in 2004 and 2005. Between Wimbledon in 2005 and the US Open in 2007, Federer captured 8 of 10 majors with a staggering record of 67–2 in those tournaments.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot at Pinewood Studios at its 007 Stage in the UK, as well as Weissensee in Austria. The pre-title {{sequence}} was filmed on the Rock of Gibraltar and although the sequence shows a hijacked Land Rover careering down various sections of road for several minutes before bursting through a wall towards the sea, the location mostly used the same short stretch of road <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the Rock, shot from numerous different angles. The beach defences seen {{at the foot of}} the Rock in the initial shot were also added solely for the film, to an otherwise non-military area. The action involving the Land Rover switched from Gibraltar to Beachy Head in the UK for the shot showing the vehicle actually getting airborne. Trial runs of the stunt with the Land Rover, during which Bond escapes by parachute from the tumbling vehicle, were filmed in the Mojave Desert, although the final cut of the film uses a shot achieved using a dummy. Other locations included Germany, the United States, and Italy, while the desert scenes were shot in Ouarzazate, Morocco. The conclusion of the film {{was shot at}} the Schönbrunn Palace, Vienna and Elveden Hall, Suffolk.|$|E

On the slopes just below the woodland, most of the clay topsoil has eroded away leaving a narrow band of oolitic limestone mixed with marl. This band of limestone, which has a radial exposition of 270 degrees stretching from the east-facing lieu-dits of Bassess Mourottes and Hautes Mourottes above Ladoix-Serrigny to down south and west to northwest facing lieu-dits of Le Charlemagne above Pernand-Vergelesses, is most suited for white wine grape varieties and have historically been the source for Corton-Charlemagne wine.|$|E
25|$|The nobility, {{including}} the upper {{levels of the}} clergy, who were closely connected with them by family ties, numbered only {{about three or four}} percent of the population; their number was estimated by modern historians at about twenty thousand men, women and children. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the nobility were the Dukes and Pairs, numbering about forty families, including that of the duc d'Orléans, who spent two million livres a year, and owned the Palais-Royal. Below them were about a hundred families with incomes between 10,000 and 50,000 livres a year, including many high-ranking military men, magistrates, and financiers. The old nobility received their income from their estates, while newer nobles depended upon payments they received from the royal government in Versailles for various government positions and titles they held.|$|E
25|$|These rocks {{were later}} unconformably {{covered by the}} Cape Supergroup. The Cape Supergroup is divided into eight {{formation}}s, the three oldest of which are present on the Peninsula. The lowest present is the reddish Graafwater formation which consist of shales and sandstone. The Graafwater Formation can be clearly seen in the cutting on the second hairpin bend as the Ou Kaapse Weg (road) goes up the slope from Westlake on to the Silvermine plateau. In the cutting one can also see the abrupt and obvious transition into the Table Mountain Sandstone (or, as it is currently known, the Peninsula Formation Sandstone) above it. Looking up the slope from below to the first hairpin bend, the granite basement on which the Graafwater formation rests is visible. And in the cutting at the first hairpin bend, the ocher-colored, gritty clay into which the granite weathers is clearly displayed. The relatively thin Graafwater layer (no more than about 60–70m thick on the Cape Peninsula) is overlain by the prominent Peninsula Formation, which consist mainly of hard, erosion resistant, quartzitic sandstone, which form the high, prominent, almost vertical cliffs of the Cape Peninsula. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> Table Mountain, at Maclear's Beacon, is a small remnant of the Pakhuis Diamictites, better represented in the Cederberg Mountains, 200km {{to the north of}} Cape Town.|$|E

500|$|During the championship's history, {{the belt}} {{has had two}} designs. It began with a white leather strap that is covered with two small gold plates that are encrusted with silver.

500|$|Arizonas last fleet {{problem was}} off Hawaii in April–May 1940. At its conclusion, the United States Pacific Fleet was {{retained}} in Hawaiian waters, based at Pearl Harbor, {{to deter the}} Japanese. She was overhauled at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington, from October 1940 to January 1941. During this refit, her anti-aircraft armament was increased to twelve 5-inch guns, {{the foundation for a}} search radar was added atop her foremast, her anti-aircraft directors were upgraded and a platform for four water-cooled [...] caliber M2 Browning machine guns was installed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the mainmast. Her last flag change-of-command occurred on 23 January 1941, when Willson was relieved by Isaac Kidd, by that time a rear admiral. Captain Harold C.

500|$|The game {{begins with}} a one-star tower with limited {{building}} options. To increase the tower's star rating, it must attract more tenants by providing more living space (or office space, {{and later in the}} game, hotel and various commercial space). New facilities are made available while the tower progresses from a one-star rating to a five-star rating. The highest achievable rating is the designation of [...] "Tower" [...] which can only be awarded by building a cathedral <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a five-star building with all possible tower levels above ground developed. The tower is limited to a maximum of 100 floors above ground and nine stories below ground. Standard elevators, which can span a maximum of 30 floors, and express elevators, which can span the entire height of the building, must be used efficiently to decrease tenant stress.|$|E
