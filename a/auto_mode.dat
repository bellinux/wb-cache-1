25|$|The first {{appearance}} of the Mitsubishi-designed Invecs-II semi-automatic Tiptronic style gearbox, based upon similar Porsche technology, was at the launch of this FTO model range. The auto models are, therefore, {{sometimes referred to as}} 'Tip' or 'Tiptronic' FTOs. Driven manually, the box 'learns' the driver's style for when motoring in <b>auto</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{most recent}} {{model is the}} Zenit-KM of 2001. This is the second {{microprocessor-controlled}} camera in the Zenit range (the first one was the second variant of the Zenit-automat camera), and the second (after the Zenit-5) motor-driven SLR camera built by KMZ. Shutter speeds range from 1/2000 to 1 sec (and up to 16 sec in <b>Auto</b> <b>mode).</b> X-sync is 1/125 sec, and the camera includes both manual shutter and aperture-priority modes as well as DX-coding from 50 to 3200 ISO. In 2004, the KM received some improvements and was renamed to the Zenit-KM Plus ...|$|E
50|$|ControlTrac has {{different}} drive modes {{as well as}} different operational behavior for those drive modes depending on which vehicle it is used in. For example, the Ford Expedition used a new auto lock feature in <b>Auto</b> <b>mode.</b> <b>Auto</b> <b>mode</b> with auto lock was not available on the Explorer at that time.|$|E
50|$|As on the Quattroporte, the {{automatic}} is a 6HP26 transmission supplied by ZF Friedrichshafen.This transmission includes <b>Auto</b> Normal <b>Mode,</b> <b>Auto</b> Sport <b>Mode,</b> <b>Auto</b> ICE <b>Mode,</b> Manual <b>Mode.</b> <b>Auto</b> Normal <b>mode</b> shifts gears automatically at low rpm {{to achieve the}} most comfortable ride and at higher rpm when driving style becomes more sporty. <b>Auto</b> Sport <b>Mode</b> changes gears 40% faster than in Normal Mode, downshifts when lifting off as a corner approaches; then it activates the stability control, stiffening Skyhook suspension, and opening exhaust valves when engine is over 3000 rpm (in GranTurismo S Automatic). <b>Auto</b> ICE <b>mode</b> is for low-grip conditions; it reduces maximum torque at the wheel, prevents 1st gear starts, and only allows gear changes below 1000 rpm.|$|R
50|$|Fly By Wire <b>modes,</b> loiter, <b>auto,</b> acrobatic <b>modes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Built using vintage Polaroid SX-70 cameras. The SLR670-S has {{the ability}} to set manual shutter speed. This is the only Polaroid that can set manual shutter speed with {{automatic}} ISO selection. ISO 640 when Time Machine is removed or under <b>Auto</b> 600 <b>mode.</b> Automatically switch to ISO 160 when under <b>Auto</b> 100 <b>mode.</b>|$|R
50|$|In this {{sequel to}} Sega Saturn's Battle Monsters, {{there are a}} total of 14 {{characters}} in the game, and two modes: Normal Mode which is a standard fighting game mode, and <b>Auto</b> <b>Mode.</b> In <b>Auto</b> <b>mode</b> the player selects a type of monster, making {{their own version of}} one of the seven playable characters. <b>Auto</b> <b>mode</b> comprises three tournaments, during which the player can upgrade their monster by winning battles. Unlike the 2D digitized actors and platforms of its predecessor, the gameplay is more like Virtua Fighter in terms of 3D characters, move sets and ring outs.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Two similar images, one {{taken in}} <b>auto</b> <b>mode</b> (underexposed), {{the other with}} manual settings.|$|E
5000|$|P: Program mode has {{the camera}} {{calculate}} both shutter speed and aperture (given a manually or automatically selected ISO). Higher-end cameras offer partial manual control to {{shift away from}} the automatically calculated values (increasing aperture and decreasing shutter time or conversely). The difference between Program mode and Full <b>Auto</b> <b>mode</b> is that in program mode, only the exposure is automatic, while other camera settings (e.g. shooting mode, exposure compensation, flash) can be set manually; in Full <b>Auto</b> <b>mode</b> everything is automatic.|$|E
5000|$|Continuous <b>Auto</b> Focus <b>mode</b> {{is quite}} noisy. Use the Single AF option.|$|R
50|$|Ultimate Flagship built {{using the}} vintage Polaroid SX-70 cameras. SLR670-S {{comes with a}} Time Machine which enables you to set manual shutter speed. This is the most {{advanced}} and the only Polaroid that can set manual shutter speed with automatic ISO selection. ISO 640 when Time Machine is removed or under <b>Auto</b> 600 <b>mode.</b> Automatically switch to ISO 160 when under <b>Auto</b> 100 <b>mode.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Shape types: Convex polyhedron, box, sphere, cone, cylinder, capsule, compound, and static {{triangle}} mesh with <b>auto</b> deactivation <b>mode</b> ...|$|R
50|$|For {{driving in}} {{particularly}} challenging conditions, such as snow, the driver can select “4WD Lock” mode. In Lock mode, the system still apportions {{front and rear}} torque automatically, but enables greater power transfer to the rear wheels. In dry conditions, 4WD Lock mode places priority on performance. More torque is directed to the rear wheels than in 4WD <b>Auto</b> <b>mode</b> to provide greater power off the line, better control when accelerating on snowy or loose surfaces, and enhanced stability at high speeds. Rear wheel torque transfer is increased by 50 percent over the amounts in 4WD <b>Auto</b> <b>mode</b> - meaning up to 60 percent of available torque {{is sent to the}} rear wheels under full-throttle acceleration on dry pavement. When in 4WD Lock mode, torque at the rear wheels is reduced by a smaller degree through corners than with 4WD <b>Auto</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{has many}} {{features}} {{found only in}} digital cameras, such as Variable aperture, tracking touch autofocus, geo-tagging, face, smile and blink detection, wide dynamic range, Smart <b>Auto</b> <b>mode,</b> image stabilization etc.|$|E
50|$|Both {{two-wheel drive}} and all-wheel drive {{versions}} of the SX4 are available, although not all combinations of drivetrain and body style may be available in a given market (for instance, until {{the latter part of}} the 2008 model year, the U.S.-market SX4 Crossover was only available with iAWD). The AWD models use an electronically controlled iAWD 3-mode four wheel drive system, user-selectable between front wheel drive 2WD mode, automatic AWD <b>AUTO</b> <b>mode,</b> and AWD LOCK 50:50 split permanent AWD LOCK mode which can only be used up to 64 km/h, after that it switches to AWD <b>AUTO</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sequential {{robotised}} transmission includes Manual Normal and Manual Sport, Manual Sport with MC-Shift, Auto Normal, Auto Sport, <b>Auto</b> ICE <b>modes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Firmware version 2.02 adds SDHC cards support, {{continuous}} AF support, and <b>auto</b> ISO <b>mode</b> (selectable from 200-400, 200-800, 200-1600, 200-3200 ISO).|$|R
5000|$|AE-Finder: The {{standard}} finder with {{a refined}} CLC metering system (introduced by the SR-T 101) and aperture priority <b>auto</b> exposure <b>mode.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Cartridge, Caliber 7.62mm, NATO, Ball, Low Recoil, XM256 (United States): 7.62×51mm NATO Single [...] bullet from M198 round. Another {{attempt to}} control the M14 in full <b>auto</b> <b>mode</b> or for small stature troops. Never adopted.|$|E
5000|$|Dynamic Desirable [...] - [...] Makes {{the port}} {{actively}} attempt {{to convert the}} link to a trunk link. The port becomes a trunk port if the neighboring Ethernet port is set to trunk, dynamic desirable or dynamic <b>auto</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
50|$|Selectable {{automatic}} full-time Control Trac {{four-wheel drive}} designed by BorgWarner is standard on all 4x4 Expeditions. There are four modes: Two High mode, <b>Auto</b> <b>mode,</b> Four High mode and Four Low mode. Each mode can be selected via a rotary control dial on the dash.|$|E
50|$|Spyder Pilot ACS: A low-end electro {{mechanical}} marker {{features an}} electronic trigger frame (CAMD) with Semi-Auto up to 20 in 3 Bursts, 6 bursts, and Full <b>Auto</b> <b>modes.</b> It {{also has a}} top-cocking venturi bolt. The gun has a lub-less bolt, Vertical Spyder pilot, but featuring a different body and Anti-Chop bolt (ACS) that helps prevent chopping and a different trigger frame (CAMD v2.0). Has semi up to 20, 3 burst, 6-burst, or full auto up to 13.|$|R
30|$|In this design, the Nordic {{transceiver}} was configured in <b>auto</b> acknowledgement <b>mode.</b> In <b>auto</b> acknowledge <b>mode,</b> {{after receiving}} a data packet, the receiver checks the CRC bits and detects whether there was any error during the transmission of the packet. If there was any error, then it requests the transmitter to resend the data packet again. This process goes on until the packet is transmitted successfully. So, in <b>auto</b> acknowledgement <b>mode,</b> no data loss happens, though the number of retries will decrease the overall data rate or application throughput. If the receiver is unable to detect error using CRC, then depending upon which bits get corrupted, the reconstructed image will have different distortions. The image compression algorithm [32, 33] used here is line-based differential coding (i.e., works row-by-row in raster scan fashion). In some cases, one row (or part of a row) of the image pixels may get corrupted if undetectable errors occurs in data packets. In worst case, the entire image frame may get corrupted.|$|R
5000|$|AE-S-Finder: Introduced {{with the}} X-1 Motor and {{equipped}} with a silicon cell instead of the slower CdS-cell of the AE-Finder. This was necessary for the <b>auto</b> exposure <b>mode</b> with motorized action.|$|R
50|$|The lens {{offers two}} {{separate}} diaphragms; one nine-bladed circular diaphragm, {{controlled by the}} camera when the lens is set to <b>auto</b> <b>mode</b> ("A"), and one ten-bladed perfectly circular diaphragm, which {{is controlled by the}} lens' aperture ring when set to manual settings T4.5 to T6.7.|$|E
50|$|The first {{appearance}} of the Mitsubishi-designed Invecs-II semi-automatic Tiptronic gearbox, licensed from Porsche, was at the launch of this FTO model range. The auto models are, therefore, {{sometimes referred to as}} 'Tip' or 'Tiptronic' FTOs. Driven manually, the box 'learns' the driver's style for when in <b>auto</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
50|$|True Remembrance also {{features}} an <b>auto</b> <b>mode,</b> which advances the text automatically so the player {{does not need}} to click, and a skip mode, which quickly skips through all text until either the player interrupts by clicking, or the game encounters text which has not yet been read by the player.|$|E
50|$|Transactions {{can either}} be {{controlled}} using SQL or API calls. It is recommended to use API calls for enabling and disabling the <b>auto</b> commit <b>mode</b> and for committing and rolling back transactions.|$|R
50|$|In {{cases where}} there is camera {{discretion}} (e.g., Auto ISO), different cameras allow different configuration of how decisions are made. For example, , Nikon cameras allow one to set the maximum and minimum ISO sensitivities, and slowest shutter speed {{that will be used}} in automatic modes, while Canon cameras will select within the fixed range of ISO 400-ISO 800 in <b>Auto</b> ISO <b>mode.</b> In Nikon cameras, the <b>Auto</b> ISO <b>mode</b> first adjusts the shutter speed, keeping ISO at its minimum desired value, then, when shutter speed reaches the user-defined limit, the ISO is increased, up to the maximum value.|$|R
50|$|In <b>auto</b> {{initialize}} <b>mode</b> {{the address}} and count values are restored upon reception of {{an end of}} process (EOP) signal. This happens without any CPU intervention. It is used to repeat the last transfer.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Auto</b> <b>mode</b> was {{featured}} on both Explorer and Expedition {{and allows for}} all-weather, full-time four-wheel drive capability on pavement as needed. In <b>Auto</b> <b>mode,</b> the engine’s torque is normally routed to the rear drive wheels. A misconception about the system is that it continuously shifts {{into and out of}} four-wheel drive as needed. This is not true, for when <b>Auto</b> <b>mode</b> is selected, the front axle hubs are permanently engaged, locking them to the front axle shafts, front differential, and front drive shaft. This is so the front drive shaft always rotates (turns) when the vehicle is being driven at speed. The computer control system needs the front drive shaft to turn, so that it can monitor and compare the rotational speed of both the front and rear drive shafts. If the rear drive shaft starts to turn faster than the front, the system interprets that (along with input from other sensors) as traction loss. When traction loss is detected, torque is sent forward to the front differential in 10 percent increments, via the center multi-disc clutch. As it does so, intelligent control software allows the center multi-disc clutch to behave like a geared center differential, such that [...] "driveline binding" [...] and [...] "torque windup" [...] do not occur. The transfer of torque is done in secrecy, virtually undetectable by the occupants of the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Expedition was {{available}} with automatic full-time ControlTrac four-wheel drive with two-speed dual range BorgWarner 4406 transfer case and a center multi-disc differential. ControlTrac {{was introduced in}} 1995 and included four selectable modes: Two High, Auto, Four High (lock) and Four Low (lock). Two High mode and <b>Auto</b> <b>mode</b> with auto-lock was not available.|$|E
50|$|Some objects, such as {{trees or}} giant fungi, are solid {{barriers}} to small creatures, while larger creatures {{are able to}} step over or move through these objects. Characters can also swap positions with other characters (since version 5), or they can attack a friend. Characters on <b>auto</b> <b>mode</b> or those that are reanimated will never attack an ally and will always try to swap positions.|$|E
50|$|Only Program AE (<b>Auto</b> Exposure) <b>mode</b> was {{available}} on the T50, in line with {{its role as a}} simple beginner's camera. A couple of years earlier, Konica had tried a similar approach with their FP-1.|$|R
