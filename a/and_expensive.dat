5|$|The Dorchester is a five-star {{luxury hotel}} on Park Lane and Deanery Street, London, {{to the east}} of Hyde Park. It is one of the world's most prestigious <b>and</b> <b>expensive</b> hotels. The Dorchester opened on 18 April 1931, and still retains its 1930s {{furnishings}} and ambiance despite being modernised.|$|E
5|$|The MP 38 {{receiver}} {{was made}} of machined steel, {{but this was a}} time-consuming <b>and</b> <b>expensive</b> process.

5|$|The {{cost of this}} cruiser {{arms race}} was significant. In the period 1889–96, the Royal Navy spent £7.3 million on new large cruisers. From 1897–1904, it spent £26.9 million. Many {{armoured}} cruisers of the new kind were just as large <b>and</b> <b>expensive</b> as the equivalent battleship.|$|E
5|$|The plan {{itself is}} not without controversy, as it has made the local club Kingstonian F.C.'s future very uncertain, with them unable {{to play in a}} ground that is now too big <b>and</b> <b>expensive</b> for a non-league side and one which they no longer have any {{decision}} over.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{every aspect}} of the battle would be managed by the DCDPS at the MAR base. The reason for this {{centralization}} was two-fold; one was that the radar system was extremely complex <b>and</b> <b>expensive</b> and could not be built in large numbers, the second was that the transistor-based computers needed to process the data were likewise very expensive. Nike-X thus relied on a few very expensive sites, and many greatly simplified batteries.|$|E
5|$|Although pure oxygen pre-breathing is an {{effective}} method to protect against altitude DCS, it is logistically complicated <b>and</b> <b>expensive</b> {{for the protection of}} civil aviation flyers, either commercial or private. Therefore, it is currently used only by military flight crews and astronauts for protection during high-altitude and space operations. It is also used by flight test crews involved with certifying aircraft, and may also be used for high-altitude parachute jumps.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the opening}} of the Barlow Road, pioneers {{traveling}} by land from the east followed the Oregon Trail to Wascopam Mission (now The Dalles) and floated down the Columbia River to Fort Vancouver, then a perilous <b>and</b> <b>expensive</b> journey.

5|$|Bond Street {{is a major}} {{shopping}} street in the West End of London. It links Piccadilly {{in the south to}} Oxford Street in the north and has been popular for retail since the 18th century, being the home of many fashion outlets that sell prestigious <b>and</b> <b>expensive</b> items. The southern section is Old Bond Street and the longer northern section New Bond Street—a distinction not generally made in everyday usage.|$|E
5|$|Building a full spliced blank {{from scratch}} was an {{expensive}} and painstaking process, {{and the large}} manufacturing facilities of Brunswick turned out good quality blanks, with beautiful points, veneers and sound construction. In Balabushka's case, his entire workshop consisted of a single lathe and other woodworking equipment {{in the confines of}} his modest garage, and building his own full-splice butts would have been prohibitively difficult <b>and</b> <b>expensive</b> for him.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1850s, the large cent (about {{the size of}} a half dollar) being issued by the Mint was {{becoming}} both unpopular in commerce <b>and</b> <b>expensive</b> to coin. After experimenting with various sizes and compositions, the Mint decided on an alloy of 88% copper and 12% nickel for a new, smaller cent. After the Mint produced patterns with an 1856 date and gave them to legislators and officials, Congress formally authorized the new piece in February 1857.|$|E

Captain George Simpson could not afford the 60–100 guineas for one,Hall 1820, primary sources. and the ship's owners were also unwilling to purchase one, even threatening to replace him with another captain if he refused to set sail without one.Hall 1833, primary sources.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before his}} {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of Belgium in 1865, the future king Leopold II began lobbying leading Belgian politicians to create a colonial empire in the Far East or Africa, which would expand and enhance Belgian prestige. Politically, however, colonisation was unpopular in Belgium as it was perceived as a risky <b>and</b> <b>expensive</b> gamble with no obvious benefit {{to the country and}} his many attempts to persuade politicians met with little success.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{this design}} would prove too {{advanced}} <b>and</b> <b>expensive</b> for Reynolds. He instead devised an alternate {{design of the}} Reynolds Building, {{which was published in}} August 1928. The new design was much more conservative, with an Italianate dome that a critic compared to Governor Al Smith's bowler hat, and a brick arrangement on the upper floors that simulated windows in the corners, a detail that remains in the current Chrysler Building. This design almost exactly reflected the shape, setbacks, and the layout of the windows of the current building, but with a different dome.|$|E

5|$|Harold Innis {{wrote his}} PhD thesis {{on the history}} of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The {{completion}} of Canada's first transcontinental railway in 1885 had been a defining moment in Canadian history. Innis's thesis, eventually published as a book in 1923, can be seen as an early attempt to document the railway's significance from an economic historian's point of view. It uses voluminous statistics to underpin its arguments. Innis maintains that the difficult <b>and</b> <b>expensive</b> construction project was sustained by fears of American annexation of the Canadian West.|$|E
5|$|Henry Cameron's platinotype {{reproductions of}} {{the first version of}} Hope had {{circulated}} since the painting's exhibition, but were slow to produce <b>and</b> <b>expensive</b> to buy. From the early 1890s photographer Frederick Hollyer produced large numbers of cheap platinotype reproductions of the second version, particularly after Hollyer formalised his business relationship with Watts in 1896. Hollyer sold the reproductions both via printsellers around the country and directly via catalogue, and the print proved extremely popular.|$|E
5|$|In 1792, Claude Chappe, a French engineer, {{built the}} first fixed visual {{telegraphy}} system (or semaphore line) between Lille and Paris. However semaphore suffered from the need for skilled operators <b>and</b> <b>expensive</b> towers at intervals of ten to thirty kilometres (six to nineteen miles). As a result of competition from the electrical telegraph, the last commercial line was abandoned in 1880.|$|E
