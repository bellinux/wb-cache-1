5|$|A cold front's {{location}} is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows {{up as the}} leading edge of the isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can move up to twice as fast as warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the cooler air mass.|$|E

5|$|Warm fronts are <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of a {{homogeneous}} warm air mass, {{which is located}} on the equatorward edge of the gradient in isotherms, and lie within broader troughs of low pressure than cold fronts. A warm front moves more slowly than the cold front which usually follows because cold air is denser and harder to remove from the Earth's surface.|$|E

5|$|The costa (C) is {{the leading}} {{marginal}} vein on most insects, although sometimes {{there is a small}} vein above the costa called the precosta, although in almost all extant insects, the precosta is fused with the costa; The costa rarely ever branches because it is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge,</b> which is associated at its base with the humeral plate. The trachea of the costal vein is perhaps a branch of the subcostal trachea. Located after the costa is the third vein, the subcosta, which branches into two separate veins: the anterior and posterior. The base of the subcosta is associated with the distal end of the neck of the first axillary (see section below). The fourth vein is the radius (R), which is branched into five separate veins. The radius is generally the strongest vein of the wing. Toward the middle of the wing, it forks into a first undivided branch (R1) and a second branch, called the radial sector (Ra), which subdivides dichotomously into four distal branches (R2, R3, R4, R5). Basally, the radius is flexibly united with the anterior end of the second axillary (2Ax).|$|E
5|$|The fungus forms a tough mat of mycelia in the humus {{and upper}} soil of pine forests. This mycelial mat grows larger with old trees, and can cover {{an area of}} several square meters. These areas {{generally}} lack dwarf shrubs and promote the vigorous growth of mosses; reindeer lichens often occur {{in the center of}} large mats. The presence of the fungus changes the nature of the soil, resulting in a thinner humus layer, decreased groundwater penetration, decreased soil pH, and increases in the level of root respiration as well as the quantity of roots. The fungus also decreases the organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations. Soil with the mycelium becomes more podzolized than the surrounding soil. Similar to some other Hydnellum species, H.ferrugineum is sensitive to the increased nitrogen deposition resulting from clear-cutting, a forestry practice used in some areas of Europe. The fungus forms an unusual type of mycorrhiza with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in which the ectomycorrhiza appears normal <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the mycelial mat, but leaves behind dead and atrophied roots at the trailing edge, showing saprophytic tendencies.|$|E

First, the decoded frame is segmented into background and foreground using a two-step predictive procedure. This segmentation is then used in estimating the motion in the next frame.

25|$|Droops are a type {{of leading}} edge device, mounted as {{they are on the}} rounded front part of a wing. The Airbus A380 has a droop between the {{fuselage}} and each inboard engine, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the thickest part of each wing. Early variants of the Hawker Siddeley Trident had two droops on the outboard of each wing and a Krueger flap on the section closest to the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|Vortilons {{consist of}} one or more flat plates {{attached}} to the underside of the wing near its leading edge, aligned with the flight direction. When the speed is reduced and the aircraft approaches stall, the local flow <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> is diverted outwards; this spanwise component of velocity around the vortilon creates a vortex streamed around the top surface, which energises the boundary layer. A more turbulent boundary layer, in turn, delays the local flow separation.|$|E

25|$|The loose, broken, and sharp, spiny {{surface of}} an aā flow makes hiking {{difficult}} and slow. The clinkery surface actually covers a massive dense core, {{which is the}} most active part of the flow. As pasty lava in the core travels downslope, the clinkers are carried along at the surface. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of an aā flow, however, these cooled fragments tumble down the steep front and are buried by the advancing flow. This produces a layer of lava fragments both at the bottom and top of an aā flow.|$|E
25|$|A squall is a sudden, sharp {{increase}} in wind speed that is usually associated with active weather, such as rain showers, thunderstorms, or heavy snow. Squalls refer {{to an increase in}} the sustained winds over a short time interval, as there may be higher gusts during a squall event. They usually occur in a region of strong mid-level height falls, or mid-level tropospheric cooling, which force strong localized upward motions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the region of cooling, which then enhances local downward motions just in its wake.|$|E

There were two spars, one <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and one at about one third chord, with interplane struts in parallel pairs connecting forward and aft spars. Those defining the bays and the centre section were vertical but the outer pairs leaned strongly outwards to support the longer upper wings. Lateral control was achieved by wing warping.|$|E

50|$|The Dornier Do 19 was a mid-wing {{cantilever}} design, and {{was mostly}} metal in construction. It had a rectangular-section fuselage and a tail unit, {{quite similar to}} the one fitted to the contemporary British Armstrong Whitworth Whitley medium bomber, with braced twin fins and rudders, mounted on the upper surface of the tailplane, itself set low on the rear fuselage as the Whitley's was. It also had retractable landing gear, including the tailwheel.

25|$|Driving an {{avalanche}} is the {{component of the}} avalanche's weight parallel to the slope; as the avalanche progresses any unstable snow in its path will tend to become incorporated, so increasing the overall weight. This force will increase as the steepness of the slope increases, and diminish as the slope flattens. Resisting this {{are a number of}} components that are thought to interact with each other: the friction between the avalanche and the surface beneath; friction between the air and snow within the fluid; fluid-dynamic drag <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the avalanche; shear resistance between the avalanche and the air through which it is passing, and shear resistance between the fragments within the avalanche itself. An avalanche will continue to accelerate until the resistance exceeds the forward force.|$|E
25|$|Barkley Canyon {{extends from}} the {{continental}} shelf edge at 400 m down the continental slope to the canyon axis at 985 m water depth. Located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the Cascadia subduction zone, this site supports {{the study of the}} accretionary prism, where the sediments pile along the continental slope as they are scraped off the subducting or descending tectonic plate. This is also a location where pressure, temperature, gas saturation, and local biological and chemical conditions are just right for exposed gas hydrates to be stable on the seafloor. Gas hydrates have gas molecules, typically methane in marine environments, trapped within “cages” of water molecules. This gives them a crystalline structure that resembles ice and can appear as white to yellow mounds covered by sediment on the seafloor.|$|E

40|$|T cells {{navigate}} complex microenvironments {{to initiate}} and modulate antigen-specific immune responses. While recent intravital microscopy {{study revealed that}} migration of T cells were guided by various tissue microstructures containing unique nanoscale topographical structures, the effects of complex nanotopographical structures on the migration of T cells have not been systematically studied. In this study, we fabricated surfaces containing nanoscale zigzag structures with various side lengths and turning angles using UV-assisted capillary force lithography and motility of T cells on zigzag patterned surfaces was studied. Motility of T cells was mostly affected by the turning angle, not by the side length, of the zigzag structures. In particular, motility behaviors of T cells near interfaces formed by turning points of zigzag patterns were significantly affected by turning angles. For obtuse turning angles, most of the T cells smoothly crossed the interfaces, but as the turning angle decreased, a substantial fraction of the T cells migrated along the interfaces. When the formation of lamellipodia, thin sheet-like structures typically generated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> of migrating cells by actin polymerization-driven membrane protrusion, was inhibited by an Arp 2 / 3 inhibitor CK- 636, a substantial fraction of T cells on those surfaces containing zigzag patterns with an acute turning angle were trapped <b>at</b> <b>the</b> interfaces formed by the turning points of the zigzag patterns.
