40|$|Accident related health {{problems}} have been suggested to cluster within persons. This phenomenon became known as <b>accident</b> <b>proneness</b> {{and has been a}} subject of many discussions. This study provides an overview of <b>accident</b> <b>proneness.</b> Therefore, 79 articles with empirical data on accident rates were identified from databases Embase, Medline, and Psychinfo. First, definitions of accidents varied highly, but most studies focused on accidents resulting in injuries requiring medical attention. Second, operationalisations of <b>accident</b> <b>proneness</b> varied highly. Studies categorised individuals into groups with ascending accident rates or made non-accident, accident, and repetitive accident groups. Third, studies examined accidents in specific contexts (traffic, work, and sports) or populations (children, students, and patients). Therefore, we concluded that no overall prevalence rate of <b>accident</b> <b>proneness</b> could be given due to the large variety in operationalisations. However, a meta-analysis of the distribution of accidents in the general population showed that the observed number of individuals with repeated accidents was higher than the number expected by chance. In conclusion, <b>accident</b> <b>proneness</b> exists, but its study is severely hampered by the variation in operationalisations of the concept. In an effort to reach professional consensus on the concept, we end this paper with recommendations for further research. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the association between}} <b>accident</b> <b>proneness</b> and (un) conscious self-destructiveness {{in a sample of}} injury repeaters attend-ing a Dutch emergency department. <b>Accident</b> <b>proneness</b> is the concept used to explain the observation that accidents tend to cluster within indi-viduals. It refers to the tendency of an individual to experience more ac-cidents than otherwise identical individuals (in terms of basic personal characteristics like age, gender and place of residence), due to stable per-sonality characteristics. Accident-prone individuals suffer from their inju-ries and they use a disproportionate part of medical services due to their injuries. This makes these individuals an important target in injury pre-vention. <b>Accident</b> <b>proneness</b> The concept of <b>accident</b> <b>proneness</b> has been and still is the subject of much debate. Therefore, this thesis starts with the investigation of the mere existence of the concept. Chapter 2 presents a review of definitions and operationalisations used in various studies concerning <b>accident</b> <b>proneness.</b> Definitions, operationalisations, and subject characteristics varied highly among these studies. Therefore, this chapter provides no overall estimate of the prevalence of <b>accident</b> <b>proneness.</b> However, by meta-analysis of empirical data of eight studies of the general population, the number of observed accident repeaters is higher than the number ex-pected by chance. Thus, an accident-prone group indeed exists. Next, the question emerges how these accident-prone individuals can be identified, since the majority of accident repeaters experience accidents due to mere bad luck. Injury circumstances This second methodological issue is investigated in Chapter 3. The group of accident repeaters is probably a heterogeneous one. Not all accident repeaters can be marked as accident-prone, because some of them may experience accidents solely due to bad luck or behaviours of others. This suggests that examining accident or injury circumstances may help to identify repeaters with accidents that occur mainly because of their own behaviours. Therefore, we compare a sample of injury repeaters and sin-gly injured patients attending an emergency department on injury cir-cumstances. Injury circumstances include injury environments such as home and traffic and include the influence of patients’ own behaviours on injury causation. In injury repeaters, patients own high-risk behaviours such as aggressiveness, alcohol, and medication use, are more often in-volved in injury occurrence than in singly injured patients. This differ-ence is especially present in environments in which these behaviours most frequently occur, namely in nightlife and at home. Mood and anxiety disorders These findings indicate that high-risk behaviours {{may play a role in}} acci-dent proneness. This raises the question whether accidents are the result of unconscious self-destructive tendencies, as illustrated by the everyday expression ‘accidentally on purpose’. Since self-destructive tendencies or intentional injuries are associated with mental illnesses, we compare a sample of the general population with injury repeaters on the prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders in Chapter 4. In high-risk behaviour injury repeaters, the prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders is higher than in a sample of the general population. This association is independent of the presence of alcohol dependence. Self-destructiveness Thus, <b>accident</b> <b>proneness</b> shares correlates with intentional injury occur-rence. <b>Accident</b> <b>proneness</b> as an expression of self-destructiveness implies that <b>accident</b> <b>proneness</b> is associated with conscious self-destructive ten-dencies such as deliberate self-harm and suicide attempts. Less evident self-destructive tendencies such as an unhealthy lifestyle may also be as-sociated with <b>accident</b> <b>proneness.</b> The position of <b>accident</b> <b>proneness</b> on a continuum of self-destructiveness is investigated in Chapter 5. We com-pare the prevalence of suicidal ideation and unhealthy lifestyles in injury repeaters and self-harmers with a sample of the general population. The results of this study reveal that injury repeaters can be placed between individuals of the population and individuals with intentional injuries on a continuum of self-destructive tendencies. <b>Accident</b> <b>proneness</b> may thus be regarded as an expression of self-destructiveness. Implications of this study In this study, we find <b>accident</b> <b>proneness</b> to be associated with high-risk behaviours, mood and anxiety disorders, and (un) conscious self-destructive tendencies. However, in the future, longitudinal research is needed to investigate the causality between these potential risk factors and <b>accident</b> <b>proneness.</b> Based on the results of those studies, prospective intervention studies can be developed targeting underlying risk factors which may prevent other health problems as well. ...|$|E

Individual factors and personality traits are the primary causes of human errors and contribute to accidents. The present study aims to investigate the relationship between the components of the five-factor model of personality and the occurrence of occupational accidents in industrial workers. The independent T-test indicated that there is a meaningful relationship between the personality traits and <b>accident</b> <b>proneness.</b> In the two groups of industry workers injured in occupational accidents and industry workers without any occupational accidents, there is a significant relationship between personality traits, neuroticism (p= 0. 001), openness to experience (p= 0. 001), extraversion (p= 0. 024) and conscientiousness (p= 0. 021). Nonetheless, concerning the personality trait of agreeableness (p = 0. 09), the group of workers with accidents did not differ significantly from the workers without any accidents.

This study was aimed to represent a method for performance evaluation of safety systems by proactive indicators using different updated models {{in the field of}} safety which will be tested in a selected industry. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional study. Proactive indicators used in this study were: Unsafe acts rate, Safety Climate, <b>Accident</b> <b>Proneness,</b> and Near-miss incident rate. The number of in 1473 safety climate questionnaires and 543 <b>Accident</b> <b>Proneness</b> questionnaires was completed. Results: The minimum and maximum safety climate score were 56. 88 and 58. 2, respectively, and the minimum and maximum scores of <b>Accident</b> <b>Proneness</b> were 98. 2 and 140. 7, respectively. The maximum number of Near-miss incident rate were 408 and the minimum of that was 196. The maximum number of unsafe acts rate was 43. 8 percent and the minimum of that was 27. 2 percent. In nine dimensions of Safety climate the eighth dimension (personal perception of risk) with the score of 4. 07 has the lowest score and the fourth (laws and safety regulations) dimension with 8. 05 has the highest score.

40|$|Background Several {{studies in}} low-income populations report the {{somewhat}} counterintuitive finding that positive income gains adversely affect adult health. The literature posits that receipt {{of a large}} portion of annual income increases, in the short term, risk-taking behaviour and/or the consumption of health-damaging goods. This work implies the hypothesis that persons with an unexpected gain in income will exhibit an elevated risk of accidental death—the fifth leading cause of death in the USA. We test this hypothesis directly by capitalizing on a natural experiment in which Cherokee Indians in rural North Carolina received discrete lump sum payments from a new casino. Methods We applied Poisson regression to the monthly count of accidental deaths among Cherokee Indians over 204 months spanning 1990 – 2006. We controlled for temporal patterns in accidental deaths (e. g. seasonality and trend) as well as changes in population size. Results As hypothesized, the risk of accidental death rises above expected levels during months of the large casino payments (relative risk[*]=[*] 2. 62; 95 % confidence interval[*]=[*] 1. 54 – 4. 47). Exploratory analyses of ethnographic interviews and behavioural surveys support that increased vehicular travel and consumption of health-damaging goods may account for the rise in <b>accident</b> <b>proneness.</b> Conclusions Although long-term income gains may improve health in this population, our findings indicate that acute responses to large income gains, in the short term, increase risk-taking and <b>accident</b> <b>proneness.</b> We encourage further investigation of natural experiments to identify causal economic antecedents of population health...|$|E

Whereas several studies have linked barometric changes to depression, no previous studies have examined or reported a link between air pollution and psychopathology.

This study aimed {{to assess the}} value of treatment in a patient who developed epilepsy after major brain surgery. Design: Case description. A 51 years-old man {{had a history of}} putative petit mal seizures since adolescence and left frontotemporal lobectomy after a major traffic accident at age 17. He subsequently developed quickly generalizing partial complex seizures, associated with severe behavioural alterations and personality changes; the condition was left untreated. A further seizure-related loss of consciousness led to another traffic accident at age 47. Methods and procedures: The patient was administered 200 mg/day topiramate, 600 mg/day quetiapine, 1000 mg/day valproate, 1200 mg/day gabapentin and 800 mg/day carbamazepine. Main outcomes and results: The instituted anti-epileptic treatment reduced seizure frequency and severity, but did not affect psychiatric symptomatology, which even worsened. An association between anti-epileptic drugs with mood stabilizing properties and an atypical anti-psychotic dramatically improved psychiatric symptoms, but did not prevent the patient from needing long-term healthcare.

As the discussion at La Baule brought out, the f irst conclusion to be der ived when a compound Poisson d ist r ibut ion emerged {{is that there is a}} degree of heterogenei ty in the data. This might be due to differences in acc ident probabi l i t ies of the under ly ing risks, but it could be due, for example, to different exposures of s imilar risks...|$|E
40|$|Many books {{focus on}} {{individual}} differences {{and how those}} relate to traffic safety, such as <b>accident</b> <b>proneness,</b> gender differences, age, alcohol, {{and the effects of}} drugs. Others focus on the safety effects regarding the vehicle, such as airbags, anti-lock brakes, navigation systems, intelligent cruise control and other new gadgets coming continually to the vehicle. Even though these topics are undoubtedly important for traffic safety, this book takes a unique approach as it focuses solely on the road environment. Designing Safe Road Systems provides the background {{for those who want to}} know more about the effects of road design on driving behaviour. It uses a systems approach to allow a better understanding of why and in what circumstances drivers may commit errors. This understanding will ultimately lead to road systems that prevent (fatal) errors from occurring. This book contains an overview of the current models and theories about human performance and human behaviour in traffic that are relevant for all those involved in designing safe road systems. The central theme of this book is how design principles can reduce the probability of an error while driving. The authors demonstrate how knowledge of human factors helps a road authority to better understand how road users behave. They argue that in many cases the design of the environment can be further adjusted to human capabilities, and that safety should be considered a system property to be built into the road system...|$|E
40|$|Objective Which theories, models, and metaphors were {{developed}} in the period and countries under study, within what context, and if available based upon what collection of data. Method For the literature review, original articles were consulted, including volumes of the Dutch safety professional journal ‘De Veiligheid’ (Safety). Results and conclusions One theory and three models on accident causation {{were developed}} {{in the domain of}} safety science. The focus on the causes of accidents and on their prevention was gradually changing from victim behavior, via task aspects to management causes. Willem Winsemius, a Dutch physician, is the father of ‘task dynamics theory’, explaining, predicting accidents from the reflex reactions and improvisations of workers during process disturbances. Based on a survey of 1300 accidents at the former Dutch steel works Hoogovens, his theory described human behavior as a response reaction, instead of an accident cause. British observational research conducted on more than 2000 accidents also highlighted the relationship between tasks, actions, process disturbances, and accidents. And William Haddon Jr., an American physician introduced the ‘epidemiological triangle’, and the known ‘hazard – barrier – target’ model. Finally, the ergonomics domain developed two models on disturbed information flows and inadequate decisions of workers. The increased complexity in the military domain and the process industry, just after World War II initiated a movement to increase system reliability, leading to a number of safety techniques which were not based on systematic research, but were rather a coded collection of practical experiences. The <b>accident</b> <b>proneness</b> theory still remained popular in the professional safety domain in the Netherlands...|$|E
