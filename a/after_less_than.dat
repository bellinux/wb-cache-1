5|$|Tension grew {{between the}} Pelham {{ministry}} and George, {{as he continued}} to take advice from Carteret and rejected pressure from his other ministers to include William Pitt the Elder in the Cabinet, which would have broadened the government's support base.

George asked Lord Bath and Carteret to form an administration, but <b>after</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 48 hours they returned the seals of office, unable to secure sufficient parliamentary support. Pelham returned to office triumphant, and George was forced to appoint Pitt to the ministry.|$|E
