40|$|Arthropods, {{which by}} some {{estimates}} comprise {{the vast majority of}} animal species, use their antennae for multimodal sensory acquisition in order to perform a wide variety of tasks. A particularly remarkable antenna-mediated behavior is rapid wall following by cockroaches. Many biologists and roboticists investigate the individual mechanisms facilitating this tactile function. Isolating and repeatedly testing the roles of each mechanosensory feature of the highly complex natural antennal structure is challenging, so an analogous <b>artificial</b> <b>antenna</b> can be a powerful experimental platform for testing hypotheses regarding wall following and the mechanics of sensing in general.

This {{question has}} always thrilled scientists but, {{only from the}} last decade, we have been witnessing determined and rapid strides in refinement of the experimental tools capable to unravel quantum dynamics. The unique property of assessing simultaneously distinct phenomena in the ultrafast time regime makes coherent two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy the leading technique in the novel field of quantum biology. <b>Artificial</b> <b>antennas,</b> thanks to their lower degree of complexity, represent ideal test systems to clarify the design principles that allow quantum phenomena to survive in their natural counterparts. We studied different multi-chromophoric model systems of light-harvesting complexes by self-assembling pigment-peptide conjugates. Distinct chromophore and protein components were tested to clarify which of these two parts has {{a crucial role in}} preserving quantum phenomena. When dealing with natural light-harvesting systems, one complicating factor in the interpretation of coherent signals is that vibronic coupling gives rise to additional oscillating patterns that might overlap with electronic features.

Green plants are provided of very sophisticated and highly efficient tools to exploit light, {{they are able to}} harvest sunlight and to transport electronic excitation energy by means of a particular “antenna system” to reaction centers (natural photosynthesis). The development of an artificial system able to mimic the natural phenomenon has been a long-standing challenge. <b>Artificial</b> <b>antenna</b> systems can be realized once several organized chromophores are able to absorb the incident light and to channel the excitation energy to a common acceptor component [1 - 3]. The optical properties of the systems depend on the molecular packing inside the channels. <b>Artificial</b> <b>antenna</b> can be built by incorporating suitable guests into the one-dimensional channels of zeolite L (ZL). In this work we present a detailed structural study of two hybrid systems in which dyes (fluorenone and thionine) are encapsulated in zeolite L channels. These two molecules were chosen since it has been demonstrated that a “two –dyes antenna system” - in which fluorenone (FL) (donor molecule) and thionine (Th) (acceptor molecule) are organized in Zeolite L porosities - shows remarkable optical properties. Due to the impossibility of studying, from the structural point of view a “two –dyes systems”, two “one-dye” hybrids (ZL/fluorenone and ZL/thionine) were firstly synthesized and characterized [4]. The results of thermogravimetric, IR, and X-ray structural refinements carried out for the one-dye ZL/FL and ZL/Th systems established that 1. 5 molecules of FL and 0. 3 molecules of Th per unit cell is the maximum loading, respectively. The FL carbonyl group strong interacts with a K+ of the ZL. On the other hand, short distances between the carbon, sulfur and nitrogen atoms of Th and two water molecule sites, in turn at bond distance from the oxygen atoms of the main channel, suggested a water-mediated Th-ZL interactions. The energy transfer from excited FL molecules, forming the non-covalent nano-ladder in the ZL channel, and Th, deposited on the external surface of ZL particles, is currently under investigation. In conclusion concerning the optical properties of our composites, no evidence of Davydov splitting emerged from our study, indicating that one of the main competitors of the FRET mechanism is not operative notwithstanding the close packed arrangement of FL. We believe that this feature is of overwhelming relevance in view of application of such a system in <b>artificial</b> <b>antenna</b> devices.

Perylene diimide (PDI) dyes are an important class of chromophores and are of great interest for the synthesis of <b>artificial</b> <b>antenna</b> systems.

ZL crystals of about 500  nm in size have been used because they meet the criteria that must be respected for the preparation of antenna composites for light harvesting, transport, and trapping. The photostability of dyes is considerably improved by inserting them into the ZL channels because the guests are protected by being confined. Plugging the channel entrances, so that the guests cannot escape into the environment is a prerequisite for achieving long-term stability of composites embedded in an organic matrix. Successful methods to achieve this goal are described. Finally, the embedding of dye–ZL composites in polymer matrices, while maintaining optical transparency, is reported.

The main focus of this work is to better understand electronic structure, excitation energy transfer (EET), and electron transfer (ET) dynamics in these systems that could have impact on achieving higher efficiency in future artificial solar cells. In {{the first part of}} this dissertation, electronic structure and EET pathways in isolated intact CP 43 prime protein complex, which is isolated from Cyanobacterium synechocystis PCC 6803 grown under iron stressed conditions, are investigated using low-temperature absorption, fluorescence, fluorescence excitation, and hole-burning (HB) spectroscopies. This work suggests that, in analogy to the CP 43 complex of PSII core, CP 43 prime possesses two quasi-degenerate low energy states, A prime and B prime. The various low-temperature optical spectra are fitted considering an uncorrelated EET model. This work suggests that for optimal energy transfer from CP 43 prime to PSI, the A prime and B prime state chlorophylls belonging to each CP 43 prime should face towards the PSI core. The second part of dissertation reports the photochemical HB study on novel Zinc bacterial reaction center (Zn-RC) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides and its β-mutant (Zn-β-RC). This study shows that ET in the two samples is similar; however, the quantum efficiency of charge separation in the mutant decreases by 60 %. This finding suggests that the coordination state of the HA site zinc bacteriochlorophyll does not tune the active branch ET. Simultaneous fits of various optical spectra using experimentally determined inhomogeneity provides more reliable electron phonon coupling parameters for the P 870 state of both RC samples.

Highly {{luminescent}} semiconductor nanocrystals {{possess a}} number of interesting and important properties that are tunable thanks to their size-dependent discrete electronic spectra characteristic of quantum dots (QDs). In this work we studied the optical properties of a novel type of hybrid structures that combine CdTe QDs with organic dye molecules (Pseudocyanine iodide (PIC)) in a J-aggregate state. Due to the excitonic nature of electronic excitations, J-aggregates have the narrowest absorption and luminescence bands among organic materials, large oscillator strengths and giant third-order nonlinear susceptibility. It was found that aggregation of PIC molecules can be efficiently triggered by fast injection of solution of CdTe QDs into concentrated dye solution resulting in formation of hybrid nano-structures. In developed structures optical energy harvested by the quantum dots as <b>artificial</b> <b>antennas</b> then transferred to J-aggregates to enhance the photostability and efficiency of the carriers recombination. To fabricate CdTe/J-aggregates hybrid nanostructures we have used an approach based on electrostatic interaction between the positively charged dye and CdTe QDs capped with thioglycolic acid and, thus, carrying a negative charge. In order to develop an efficient hybrid material operating in the FRET regime, we carefully selected the PL colors (diameters) of the QD (donors of energy) to be optically coupled with absorption of J-aggregates. Also we took advantage of extremely thin surface ligand shell (0. 5 nm) of CdTe QDs, which insures high efficiency of energy transfer. Formed QD/J-aggregate FRET system shows the broadband absorption in the visible and the ultraviolet part of the spectrum typical of quantum dots, along with the narrow emission linewidths characteristic of J-band emitters (15 nm full width at half-maximum).

The energy transfer times from the antenna aggregate to the trap are in the picosecond time range (7 - 9 ps) under reducing conditions (addition of dithionite to avoid oxidative quenching) and were resolved in all cases. Under nonreducing conditions substantial fluorescence quenching occurred in the antenna aggregates. We tentatively suggest that {{a small amount of}} chlorin cations acts as a quencher.

This methodology addresses the ability of an individual antenna to transfer its absorbed energy towards a single pool of emissive states, using a single parameter called energy funneling efficiency (ε). We studied individual peripheral antennas of purple bacteria (LH 2) and single CP chains of 20 nm length. As expected from a perfect antenna, LH 2 s showed funneling efficiencies close to unity. In contrast, CPs showed lower average funneling efficiencies, greatly varying from molecule to molecule. Cyclodextrin insulation of the conjugated backbone improves EET, increasing the fraction of CPs possessing ε = 1.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Artificial</b> {{photosynthetic}} <b>antenna</b> {{systems have}} been synthesized based on carotenoid polyenes and polymer-polyenes covalently attached to tetrapyrroles. Absorption {{of light in the}} blue/green region of the spectra excites the polyenes to their S 2 state, and ultra-fast singlet energy transfer to the tetrapyrroles occurs when the chromophores are in partial conjugation. The additional participation of other excited states of the polyene in the energy-transfer process is a requirement for perfect antenna function. Analogs of photosynthetic re-action centers consisting of tetrapyrrole chromophores covalently linked to electron accep-tors and donors have been prepared. Excitation of these constructs results in a cascade of energy transfer/electron transfer which, in selected cases, forms a final charge-separated state characterized by a giant dipole moment (> 150 D), a quantum yield approaching unity, a sig-nificant fraction of the photon energy stored as chemical potential, and a lifetime sufficient for reaction with secondary electron donors and acceptors. A new antenna-reaction center complex is described in which a carotenoid moiety is located in partial conjugation with the tetrapyrrole π-system allowing fast energy transfer (< 100 fs) between the chromophores. In this assembly, the energy transduction process can be initiated by light absorbed by the poly-ene...|$|R
