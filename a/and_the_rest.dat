5|$|A {{study in}} 2009 of seven {{mitochondrial}} genes (mtDNA) and three nuclear genes grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs (family Lepilemuridae), offering {{a host of}} explanations, such as a possible hybridization (introgression) following the initial split between the families. A study published in 2013 also grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs when it used 43morphological traits and mtDNA. If correct, this would make the family Cheirogaleidae paraphyletic. Broad agreement between two lemur phylogeny studies—one in 2004 using SINE analysis and another in 2012 using multilocus phylogenetic tests—gave strong support for a sister group relationship between fork-marked lemurs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the cheirogaleids and a more distant relationship with sportive lemurs. The split between Phaner <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the cheirogaleids {{is thought to have}} occurred approximately 38mya (million years ago), not long after the radiation of most of the major lemur groups on Madagascar, roughly 43mya.|$|E
