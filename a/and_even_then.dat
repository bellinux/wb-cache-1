5|$|Common {{and often}} basic {{ingredients}} in many modern European cuisines like potatoes, kidney beans, cacao, vanilla, tomatoes, chili peppers and maize {{were not available}} to Europeans until after 1492, after European contact with the Americas, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>then</b> it often took considerable time, sometimes several centuries, for the new foodstuffs {{to be accepted by}} society at large.|$|E
5|$|Previous space {{missions}} to comets, such as Giotto and Stardust, were fly-by missions. These missions {{were able to}} photograph and examine only the surfaces of cometary nuclei, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>then</b> from considerable distances. The Deep Impact mission {{was the first to}} eject material from a comet's surface, and the mission garnered large publicity from the media, international scientists, and amateur astronomers.|$|E
5|$|Pulmonary oxygen {{toxicity}} is {{an entirely}} avoidable event while diving. The limited duration and naturally intermittent nature of most diving makes this a relatively rare (<b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>then,</b> reversible) complication for divers.

5|$|All of the Irish kingdoms {{had their}} own kings but were {{nominally}} subject to the High King. The High King was drawn {{from the ranks of}} the provincial kings and ruled also the royal kingdom of Meath, with a ceremonial capital at the Hill of Tara. The concept didn't become a political reality until the Viking Age <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>then</b> was not a consistent one. Ireland did have a culturally unifying rule of law: the early written judicial system, the Brehon Laws, administered by a professional class of jurists known as the brehons.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of these and other studies in the early 1970s, the current consensus is that the use of methoxyflurane should be restricted only to healthy individuals, in situations where it offers specific advantages <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>then,</b> only at dosages less than 2.5MAC hours. Partly because of these warnings, but also because of the development of newer volatile anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane, the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|Because {{mechanical}} refrigeration is energy intensive, active collectors {{are typically}} restricted {{to places where}} there is no supply of water that can be desalinated or purified at a lower cost and that are sufficiently far from a supply of fresh water to make transport uneconomical. Such circumstances are uncommon, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>then</b> large installations such as that tried in the 1930s at Cook in South Australia failed because of the cost of running the installation – it was cheaper to transport water over large distances.|$|E

5|$|Spanish conquistadors brought {{potatoes}} and tomatoes from the Americas to Europe in the 16th century, but these vegetables only became commonly grown and consumed in Eastern Europe in the 19th century. Eventually, both became staples of peasant diet and essential ingredients of Ukrainian and Russian borscht. Potatoes replaced turnips in borscht recipes, and tomatoes – fresh, canned or paste – took over from beet sour {{as the source}} of tartness. The turnip is rarely found in modern recipes, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>then,</b> together with potatoes. In Ukraine, beet sour and tomatoes were both used for some time until the latter ultimately prevailed during the last third of the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The Notitia lists a {{large number}} of units with barbarian names. This was {{probably}} the result of the transformation of irregular allied units serving under their own native officers (known as socii, or foederati) into regular formations. During the Principate, regular units with barbarian names are not attested until the 3rd century <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>then</b> rarely e.g. the ala I Sarmatarum attested in 3rd-century Britain, doubtless an offshoot of the Sarmatian horsemen posted there in 175.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{economic}} activity, permanent {{settlement of the}} peninsula did not intensify until the 1860s <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>then</b> it remained sporadic until 1917. The population of Kola in 1880, for example, was only around 500inhabitants living in 80households, compared to 1,900inhabitants in 300households living there in 1582. Transportation facilities were virtually non-existent and the communication {{with the rest of}} Russia irregular. 1887 saw an influx of Izhma Komi and Nenets people who were migrating to the peninsula to escape a reindeer disease epidemic in their home lands and brought their large deer herds with them, resulting in increased competition for the grazing lands, a conflict between the Komi and the Sami, and in marginalization of the local Sami population. By the end of the 19th century, the Sami population had mostly been forced north, with ethnic Russians settling in the south of the peninsula.|$|E

5|$|Drugs {{are tested}} {{by the people who}} {{manufacture}} them, in poorly designed trials, on hopelessly small numbers of weird, unrepresentative patients, and analysed using techniques which are flawed by design, {{in such a way that}} they exaggerate the benefits of treatments. Unsurprisingly, these trials tend to produce results that favour the manufacturer. When trials throw up results that companies don't like, they are perfectly entitled to hide them from doctors and patients, so we only ever see a distorted picture of any drug's true effects. Regulators see most of the trial data, but only from early on in a drug's life, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>then</b> they don't give this data to doctors or patients, or even to other parts of government. This distorted evidence is then communicated and applied in a distorted fashion.|$|E
5|$|Fossil (or subfossil) black {{vultures}} cannot {{necessarily be}} attributed to the Pleistocene or the recent species without further information: the same size variation found in the living bird was also present in its larger prehistoric relative. Thus, in 1968, Hildegarde Howard separated the Mexican birds as Coragyps occidentalis mexicanus as opposed to the birds from locations farther north (such as Rancho La Brea) which constituted the nominate subspecies C. o. occidentalis. The southern birds were of the same size as present-day north black vultures and can only be distinguished by their somewhat stouter tarsometatarsus and the flatter and wider bills, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>then</b> only with any certainty if the location where the fossils were found is known. As the Pleistocene and current black vultures form an evolutionary continuum rather than splitting into two or more lineages, some include the Pleistocene taxa in C. atratus.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the policy}} of the Christian {{authorities}} was generally to block such emigration. Consequently, this option was only practically doable for the wealthiest among those living near the southern coast, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>then</b> with great difficulty. For example, in Sierra Bermeja, Granada in 1501, an option of exile was offered as an alternative to conversion only for those who paid a fee of ten gold doblas, which most citizens could not afford. In the same year, villagers of Turre and Teresa near Sierra Cabrera in Almeria fought the Christian militias with help from their North African rescuers at Mojácar while leaving the region. The people of Turre were defeated and the planned escape turned into a massacre; the people of Teresa got away but their properties, except what could fit into their small boats, were left behind and confiscated.|$|E

5|$|Neville {{received}} a papal dispensation for his illegitimacy on 25 January 1220, {{on the recommendation}} of the king, Stephen Langton the Archbishop of Canterbury, other bishops, and the papal legate Cardinal Guala Bicchieri, all of whom testified to his good reputation and character. In late October he was named chancellor of the see of Chichester, but was then elected Bishop of Chichester on about 1 November 1222. He was given control of the temporalities of the bishopric on 3 November 1222, and was consecrated on 21 April 1224. In April 1223 Neville was ordered by Pope Honorius III to cease using the Great Seal on the command of the justiciar or other members of the minority council, but instead to do so only at the king's command, essentially ending the royal minority. But it did not finally end until December 1223, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>then,</b> as the king had not yet been officially declared of age, the ban on grants without a fixed time limit remained in force.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} Rimsky-Korsakov's dismissal, a student {{production}} of his opera Kashchey the Deathless was followed {{not with the}} scheduled concert but with a political demonstration, {{which led to a}} police ban on Rimsky-Korsakov's work. Due in part to widespread press coverage of these events, an immediate wave of outrage against the ban arose throughout Russia and abroad; liberals and intellectuals deluged the composer's residence with letters of sympathy, and even peasants who had not heard a note of Rimsky-Korsakov's music sent small monetary donations. Several faculty members of the St. Petersburg Conservatory resigned in protest, including Glazunov and Lyadov. Eventually, over 300 students walked out of the Conservatory in solidarity with Rimsky-Korsakov. By December he had been reinstated under a new director, Glazunov; Rimsky-Korsakov retired from the Conservatory in 1906. The political controversy continued with his opera The Golden Cockerel. Its implied criticism of monarchy, Russian imperialism and the Russo-Japanese War gave it little chance of passing the censors. The premiere was delayed until 1909, after Rimsky-Korsakov's death, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>then</b> it was performed in an adapted version.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November Soviet forces {{began to}} cross the Don River and {{continued}} their advance towards the town of Kalach. German forces defending Kalach, mostly composed of maintenance and supply personnel, {{were not aware of}} the Soviet offensive until 21 November, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>then</b> did not know in what strength the Red Army was approaching. The task of taking the bridge at Kalach was given to the Soviet 26th Tank Corps, which used two captured German tanks and a reconnaissance vehicle to approach it and fire on the guards. Soviet forces broke into the town by mid-morning and drove the defenders out, allowing themselves and the 4th Tank Corps to link up with the Red Army's 4th Mechanized Corps approaching from the south. The encirclement of German forces in Stalingrad was completed on 22 November 1942. That day Soviet formations also continued to fight pockets of Romanian resistance, such as that put up by the Romanian 5th Corps.|$|E

5|$|Summerhayes {{hoped that}} Titterton {{would be able}} to enter the University of Cambridge, but the paper mill that his father worked for closed due to the Great Depression, leaving his father {{unemployed}} for a time, and unable to afford it. Instead, in 1934, Titterton was accepted into University of Birmingham on a teacher's scholarship, which paid his tuition fees, board and residence at Chancellor's Hall, a hostel for male undergraduates. Due to his achievements at secondary school, Ernest was allowed to begin his tertiary studies with second-year subjects, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>then</b> he was said to have found them easy. He obtained his Bachelor of Science in 1936 with distinctions in both pure and applied mathematics and, of course, physics. An honours year quickly followed, and Titterton topped the year in physics. He continued his interest in music, playing the piano at social events. He also played hockey with the university First XI from 1934 to 1936.|$|E
5|$|The {{new town}} of Conwy was {{populated}} by English settlers, particularly from nearby Cheshire and Lancashire, {{and the town}} walls were in part designed to encourage immigrants to settle there in safety. The town of Conwy was only modestly successful, however; by 1312 it had 124 burgage tenements – properties paying rent to the king – making it more successful than neighbouring Caernarfon, but less so than Beaumaris. Welsh residents appear to have slowly arrived inside the town during the 14th century, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>then</b> were subject to considerable suspicion. Protecting the town remained a priority and during this period the constable charged with {{the security of the}} castle was also the mayor of Conwy, although protecting the town walls was probably the duty of the citizens rather than the forces attached to the castle. The walls were guarded by crossbowmen, and improved firing positions for them were built into the town walls {{at the start of the}} 14th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{party was}} {{according}} to political scientist Cas Mudde only very rarely accused of anti-Semitism – <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>then,</b> it was strongly condemned {{by the party}} leadership. When Roeland Raes {{cast doubt on the}} scale of the Holocaust in a television interview in 2001 for instance, the party leadership immediately called an emergency meeting, distanced itself from him and forced him to resign. The party also took screening measures against its local candidates to reveal any possible extremist connections, and rather wanted to risk not being able to fill its lists, rather than filling them with extremists. Particularly, the party wanted to distance itself from Holocaust denial, as it actively sought to reach out to Jewish voters in Antwerp.|$|E
