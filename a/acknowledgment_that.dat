5|$|David Brooks {{argued that}} a more {{fundamental}} shift from a materialist to a post-materialist mindset has occurred in recent generations. While for generations born early in the century increased income {{was the same as}} improvements in lifestyle this is no longer true for people born into an affluent, information driven world. Younger generations live much more intellectually diverse lives and cites much user generated content as being mostly produced outside of the monetary economy. He affirms Cowen's <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>that</b> this has brought large increases in human happiness with correspondingly little economic activity.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the course}} of the {{research}} represented in the book, Heilmann considers and eventually rejects the possibility of all living and several extinct groups of reptiles as potential ancestors for modern birds, including crocodilians, pterosaurs and several groups of dinosaurs. Despite his <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>that</b> some of the smaller Jurassic theropods had many similarities to Archaeopteryx and modern birds, he determined that they were unlikely to be direct bird ancestors and that they were instead closely–related offshoots, and concluded that the similarities were a result of convergent evolution rather than direct ancestry. Based essentially on a process of elimination, Heilmann arrives at the conclusion that birds must be descended from thecodonts, a group of archosaurs that lived during the Permian and Triassic periods. Although this conclusion was later shown to be inaccurate, The Origin of Birds was regarded as a masterful piece of scholarship at the time and set the international agenda for research in bird evolution for nearly half a century, and much of its research remains of interest.|$|E

Instead the funding would be used to provide weapons and ammunition to rebel groups already in place. Other, covert and significantly larger, programs in Syria were being run by the CIA and continued under the Barack Obama administration.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, just as Rabbinic Judaism was in {{part the}} Pharisaic {{response}} to their <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>that</b> the Temple would not be rebuilt in their lifetimes, Christianity reflected the acknowledgment of early Christians that the Second Coming of Christ {{and the establishment of}} God's kingdom on earth was not to happen in their lifetimes. The critical analysis of the Gospels involves, at least in part, a consideration of how these concerns affected the Gospels' accounts of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|The notions {{above are}} not as {{unfamiliar}} as they might at first appear. The customary acceptance {{of the fact that}} any real number x has a decimal expansion is an implicit <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>that</b> a particular Cauchy sequence of rational numbers (whose terms are the successive truncations of the decimal expansion of x) has the real limit x. In some cases {{it may be difficult to}} describe x independently of such a limiting process involving rational numbers.|$|E

25|$|In June 1903, Pershing {{was ordered}} {{to return to the}} United States. President Theodore Roosevelt, taken by Pershing's ability, petitioned the Army General Staff to promote Pershing to colonel. At the time, Army officer {{promotions}} were based primarily on seniority rather than merit, and although there was widespread <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>that</b> Pershing should serve as a colonel, the Army General Staff declined to change their seniority-based promotion tradition just to accommodate Pershing. They would not consider a promotion to lieutenant colonel or even major. This angered Roosevelt, but since the President could only name and promote army officers in the General ranks, his options for recognizing Pershing through promotion were limited.|$|E
25|$|Animist beliefs {{can also}} be {{expressed}} through artwork. For instance, among the Maori communities of New Zealand, there is an <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>that</b> creating art through carving wood or stone entails violence against the wood or stone person, and that the persons who are damaged therefore have to be placated and respected during the process; any excess or waste from {{the creation of the}} artwork is returned to the land, while the artwork itself is treated with particular respect. Harvey therefore argued that the creation of art among the Maori was not about creating an inanimate object for display, but rather a transformation of different persons within a relationship.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the success}} that The Blood of Jesus enjoyed, Williams’ next film was {{considered}} an epic failure and seen by few. The {{attempt to create a}} wartime drama resulted in the film Marching On! (1943). Set with World War II as the backdrop, the film was badly made and was left {{in the shadow of the}} Army financed film The Negro Soldier (1944). Most of the narrative seen in Marching On was influenced by William’s own time in the army during World War I. Due to an uneven and uninteresting plot the film was seen as a dud and was unable to garner the social <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>that</b> Williams had hoped it would receive.|$|E

To that Gentleman I owe the most distinct, as well as liberal information, concerning a very interesting and important subject, the Bank of Amsterdam; of which no printed account had ever appeared to me satisfactory, or even intelligible. The name of that Gentleman is so well known in Europe, the information which comes from him must do so much honour to whoever has been favoured with it, and my vanity is so much interested in making this <b>acknowledgment,</b> <b>that</b> I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of prefixing this Advertisement to this new Edition of my Book.|$|E
25|$|In 1962 a {{group of}} Ray's {{students}} approached him about forming a band. Ray agreed and an informal group was formed. As the group practiced together and improved they were eventually asked to entertain in public. They called themselves the Cupertino Banjo Band and the original nine members were Glenn Atkinson, Jerry Deerwester, Don Flora, Pearl Nicolino, Chuck Ray, Sr., Manuel Rodriques, Steve Sedlak, Sidney Steele, and Merle Wilhelm. Later, as the group increased in size, they temporarily called themselves the Golden Gate Banjo Band. Then in 1971, as an <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>that</b> band members came from a much larger area than Cupertino, {{they came up with}} the name Peninsula Banjo Band. The band included members from as far south as Santa Cruz and as far north as Burlingame.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the goals, approach, implementation, {{and performance of}} Mflow, a multicast flow control protocol. Our work focuses {{on the issues that}} arise from the increase in <b>acknowledgments</b> <b>that</b> occur as the size of the group grows. Mflow makes use of bulk acknowledgments to substantially reduce the number of acknowledgments per multicast message. It also staggers acknowledgments from different destinations to avoid storms of messages. We demonstrate that staggering can both decrease the number of acknowledgments needed for effective flow control as well as increase the robustness of the protocol to changes in the environment. We analyze both message and computation efficiency of Mflow. The protocol is computationally efficient and performs well in our experiments...|$|R

25|$|The British Superintendent of Trade in China, Charles Elliot, {{protested the}} {{decision}} to forcibly seize the opium stockpiles. He ordered all ships carrying opium to flee and prepare for battle. Lin responded by quarantining the foreign dealers in their warehouses, and kept them from communicating with their ships in port. To defuse the situation, Elliot convinced the British traders to cooperate with Chinese authorities and hand over their opium stockpiles {{with the promise of}} eventual compensation for their losses by the British government. While this amounted to a tacit <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>that</b> the British government did not disapprove of the trade, it also placed a huge liability on the exchequer. This promise, and the inability of the British government to pay it without causing a political storm, was an important casus belli for the subsequent British offensive. During April and May 1839, British and American dealers surrendered 20,283 chests and 200 sacks of opium. The stockpile was publicly destroyed on the beach outside of Guangzhou.|$|E
25|$|In 1823, {{he started}} the now {{well-known}} medical weekly, The Lancet, with William Cobbett, William Lawrence, James Wardrop and a libel lawyer as associates. It was extremely successful: by 1830, it had a circulation of about 4,000. In 1828, one of his accounts of medical negligence accused Bransby Cooper (the nephew of Sir Astley Cooper, the General Surgeon) of incompetence in causing a patient immense suffering as he attempted to extract a bladder stone through a cut beneath the scrotum. Such operations were regularly completed in only a minute's time by excellent surgeons such as the previous century's William Cheselden, but Cooper took {{more than an hour}} and was seen to have great difficulty in locating the stone. The magazine account led to a libel case, Cooper v Wakley, which would raise the profile and popular prestige of Wakley and his magazine. The court found in Cooper's favor, but awarded him much smaller damages than requested, which was generally taken as an <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>that</b> Wakley's accusations of incompetence and nepotism were justified.|$|E
25|$|With their western flank {{secured by}} an unthreatening New Mexico, the Comanche dealt with rivals on their {{northern}} and eastern borders. In 1835, {{they met with}} a delegation of U.S. soldiers and eastern Indians in the Wichita Mountains of Oklahoma and concluded a peace agreement. The agreement permitted eastern Indians and Anglo-Americans to hunt on Comanche lands and did not restrain the Comanche and their Kiowa and Wichita allies from making war on Mexico. With their eastern flank secured by the treaty with the U.S., the Comanches next concluded a peace agreement in 1840 with the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho pressing on them from the north. It was highly favorable to the Cheyenne and Arapaho. They were permitted to reside and hunt on the buffalo and horse-rich Comanche lands and, in addition, the affluent Comanches gave them gifts, including {{as many as six}} horses to every Cheyenne and Arapaho man. The Comanche welcome to these two tribes, their southern bands numbering perhaps 4,000, was both an <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>that</b> they were formidable rivals and also that the Comanche were short on men and resources to maintain their control over Comancheria.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in 1974, the fictitious Peter Orno (alternatively, Peter Ørno, P. Ørno, and P. Orno) {{appeared}} {{as the author}} of research papers in mathematics. According to Robert Phelps, the name [...] "P. Orno" [...] is a pseudonym that was inspired by [...] "porno", an abbreviation for [...] "pornography". Orno's short papers have been called [...] "elegant" [...] contributions to functional analysis. Orno's theorem on linear operators is important in the theory of Banach spaces. Research mathematicians have written <b>acknowledgments</b> <b>that</b> have thanked Orno for stimulating discussions and for Orno's generosity in allowing others to publish his results.

25|$|In Quinn's first start, the Irish were bolstered with Quinn's 297passing {{yards on}} 59attempts. However, Purdue's defense intercepted four of Quinn's passes and sacked him five times {{en route to}} a 23–10 Boilermaker victory. Quinn {{remained}} as the starter and, with Willingham's <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>that</b> the running game needed to take more of a role in the next game, got his first win against Pittsburgh. He was helped by Julius Jones' school-record 262rushing yards. Notre Dame lost their next three games, including Willingham's second straight 31point loss to USC, a last minute loss to Boston College, and their first home shutout since 1978 to Florida State. The Irish players began to call the season disappointing, as the team needed to win their last four games to make a bowl game. They looked to have a chance of becoming bowl eligible, as their next three games were a last minute win that improved their streak to 40games over Navy, a win on senior day over the Brigham Young University (BYU) Cougars, and a win over Stanford that saw the Irish offense finally connect in the season. Notre Dame lost their final game to Syracuse, however. With a 5–7 record, the Irish finished with the twelfth losing season {{in the history of the}} Notre Dame football program.|$|E
500|$|Mylod, {{spoke about}} the {{decision}} to show Blackfish's death off screen, saying [...] "there {{was a lot of}} tonal discussion about this, and I think I can safely speak for the writers that the choice was a conscious one in the writing not to see his actual death, because the emotional focus was really about the final moments between him and Brienne -- two warriors, two samurais, facing each other -- and Brienne's <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>that</b> this fellow samurai has chosen his moment, and this is his moment of dignity and choice of his death. So it was really about that moment of choice and the dignity and acceptance between these two great warriors, rather than the actual detail of his actual death.
