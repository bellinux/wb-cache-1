5|$|Although {{they failed}} to <b>achieve</b> <b>their</b> objectives, by nightfall the ANZACs had formed a beachhead, albeit much smaller than intended. In places they were {{clinging}} onto cliff faces with no organised defence system. Their precarious position convinced both divisional commanders to ask for an evacuation, but after taking advice from the Royal Navy about how practicable that would be, the army commander decided they would stay. The exact number of the day's casualties is not known. The ANZACs had landed two divisions but over two thousand of their men had been killed or wounded, together {{with at least a}} similar number of Turkish casualties.|$|E

5|$|At Green Beach to the west, {{part of the}} South Saskatchewan Regiment was {{landed on}} the wrong side of the Scie River, necessitating an assault over the machine gun swept bridge there so they could assault the cliffs on the west.

The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders were landed with the objective of moving south to attack an airfield and a divisional HQ. Neither battalion was able to <b>achieve</b> <b>their</b> objectives. As with the other three beaches, casualties among the Canadians were high with 160 fatalities.|$|E

In addition, fighters find themselves in a reality beyond their control, most notably in the manipulative hands of the villainess I-No, who is revealed to be a servant of “That Man”, the creator of the Gears.

5|$|A {{composite}} of Perrault's male heroes, however, indicates {{the opposite of}} his heroines: his male characters are not particularly handsome, but they are active, brave, ambitious, and deft, and they use their wit, intelligence, and great civility {{to work their way}} up the social ladder and to <b>achieve</b> <b>their</b> goals. In this case of course, it is the cat who displays the characteristics and the man benefits from his trickery and skills. Unlike the tales dealing with submissive heroines waiting for marriage, the male-centered tales suggest social status and achievement are more important than marriage for men. The virtues of Perrault's heroes reflect upon the bourgeoisie of the court of Louis XIV and upon the nature of Perrault, who was a successful civil servant in France during the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|Below {{these are}} the members of UK Headquarters, {{including}} the association's Chief Scout, who is honorary head of the association and its public face, and the UK Chief Commissioner, {{who is in charge}} of the volunteers in the association and of the other commissioners.

The final managerial role in the association is that of the Group Scout Leader and their assistant, who are both in charge of a local Scout group. All of these roles are uniformed and for those volunteer roles from County level downwards training is required in the basic values of the association, safety and child protection, inclusion and advanced managerial skills to <b>achieve</b> <b>their</b> Wood Badge.|$|E
5|$|Georgian forces, {{among them}} special {{forces of the}} Ministry of Internal Affairs, entered Tskhinvali after taking the heights near the town. The {{centre of the town}} was reached by 1,500 men of Georgian {{infantry}} by 10:00. The Russian air force began bombing targets inside South Ossetia and Georgia proper after 10:00 on 8 August. According to Russia, it suffered its first casualties at around 12:00 when two servicemen were killed and five wounded following an attempt by the Georgian troops to storm the northern peacekeeping base in Tskhinvali. Georgia has stated that it only targeted Russian peacekeepers in self-defence, after coming under fire from them. Most of Tskhinvali and several villages had been secured by Georgian forces by the afternoon; however, they failed to <b>achieve</b> <b>their</b> objective of blocking the Gupta bridge and the key roads linking Tshkinvali with the Roki Tunnel and the Russian military base in Java. One Georgian diplomat told Kommersant {{on the same day that}} by taking control of Tskhinvali, Tbilisi wanted to demonstrate that Georgia wouldn't tolerate killing of Georgian citizens.|$|E
