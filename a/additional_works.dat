The man is standing to the left and gazing to the side, apparently at the woman, who is seated and breastfeeding a baby; {{the relationship between the two}} figures is unclear. In Pastoral Concert, two clothed men and a nude woman are seated on the grass, engaged in music making, while a second nude woman stands beside them.|$|E

This interchange included a flyover bridge from Manning Road, which utilised a curved design similar to the South Perth Interchange bridge. The Canning Interchange opened on 19 July 1979. Construction works south of the interchange began in 1979. The freeway was initially planned to terminate at Leach Highway, but was extended as far as South Street, {{at the request of}} the Melville City Council. The council wanted the extra length of freeway to alleviate congestion on its local roads, and contributed $600,000 to expedite the construction. This stage included construction of the Mount Henry Bridge across the Canning River. , it is Western Australia's longest bridge, at a length of [...] The , $35.8 million extension was opened on 9 May 1982 by Ray O'Connor, then Premier of Western Australia. <b>Additional</b> <b>works</b> undertaken to prepare for the opening included widening the existing stretch of freeway to three lanes in each direction, and reconfiguring the Narrows Bridge to include an additional central lane, reversible during peak traffic flows.|$|E
500|$|The {{photography}} for {{the album}} was handled by drummer Shannon Leto, with <b>additional</b> <b>works</b> provided by Ken Schles. The cover art features a teenage boy {{and some of the}} band's symbolism. It includes a phoenix logo, named [...] "Mithra" [...] by the band, that bears the motto [...] "Provehito in Altum". Roughly translated from Latin, the phrase means [...] "Launch forth into the deep". The band chose a phoenix for its association with rebirth and renewal in the Greek mythology. The group expressed interest in signs and symbols and their relationships with cultures and subcultures. The album's cover art was unveiled through the band's official website on July 29, 2002. However, it was not conceived to be the original concept for the artwork. The initial cover art was discontinued and destroyed during production following the September 11 attacks due to the graphic content of the image. It featured a fighter pilot ejecting from an exploding plane. Thirty Seconds to Mars explained that they never saw it as a violent image, but felt that it was inappropriate {{in the wake of the}} events.|$|E
500|$|The {{similarities}} between the altarpiece and the c.late 1460s Last Judgement by van der Weyden's apprentice Hans Memling has led art historians to suggest a common tie, Florentine banker Angelo Tani, gave commissions to van der Weyden {{before his death in}} 1464. Because Memling's apprenticeship post-dated the completion and installation of the altarpiece, art historians speculate that Tani or Memling would have seen it in situ, [...] or that Memling came into possession of a workshop design. Two <b>additional</b> <b>works</b> with similar depictions of [...] Christ– a Martin Schongauer at the Louvre dated c.1469 and another in Germany from about 1493– suggest the existence of the input of members of his workshop. In Memling's work the Deësis and Christ's placement, above St Michael with his scales, are almost identical to the Beaune Altarpiece. Despite the marked similarities, the crowded scenes in Memling's Last Judgement contrast sharply with [...] "the hushed serenity of Rogier's composition," [...] according to Lane, and in a mirror image of van der Weyden's altarpiece, Memling shows the saved outweighing the damned in St Michael's scales.|$|E

For instance, in 1921 he wrote to all the Australian Victoria Cross recipients of World War I or their families to ask that they donate their wartime diaries or other personal items. The Museum also actively sought the wartime diaries and letters written by {{other members of the}} AIF; Treloar hoped that these records would allow a psychological study to be conducted on the men who had joined the AIF. Taking up an idea of Bean's, Treloar oversaw the development of several dioramas depicting key Australian battles of the war and engaged professional artists to make the models. Several of the dioramas produced in the 1920s remain on display in the AWM and are among its most popular exhibits. Treloar also oversaw the completion of the artworks which had been commissioned from the official war artists during World War I and, in collaboration with Bean, ordered <b>additional</b> <b>works.</b> The institution was renamed the [...] "Australian War Memorial Museum" [...] in 1923, most likely on the suggestion of Treloar.|$|E
