40|$|Since {{the sensational}} {{discovery}} of a living coelacanth off {{the east coast of}} South Africa, the geographic distribution of viable coelacanth populations has been a subject of debate. In the past, the coelacanths off the African mainland were thought to be strays from the Comoros because most coelacanths captured were caught in the waters surrounding the Comoros archipelagos. However, in recent years, a large number of coelacanths were captured off the coast of Tanzania, including nine living specimens observed in <b>a</b> <b>remotely</b> <b>operated</b> <b>vehicles</b> survey. Thus, it is possible that there is a reproducing population inhabiting waters off the Tanzania coast. We have sequenced the complete mitochondrial genomes of 21 Tanzanian and 2 Comoran coelacanths and analyzed these sequences together with two additional full mitochondrial genomes and 47 d-loop sequences from the literature. We found that the coelacanth population off the northern Tanzanian coast is genetically differentiated from those of the southern Tanzania coast and the Comoros, whereas no significant genetic differentiation occurs between the latter two localities. The differentiation between the northern and southern Tanzanian coast populations is consistent with the hypothesis that the existence of northward-flowing ocean current along the Tanzanian coast may reduce or prevent gene flow from the northern to the southern population. Finally, we estimated that the population localized to the southern Tanzanian coast and the Comoros diverged from other coelacanths at least 200, 000 y ago. These results indicate that the coelacanths off the northern Tanzania coast are not strays but a genetically distinct group. Our study provides important information for the conservation of this threatened “living fossil. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{integrated}} maneuver {{and control}} structures for <b>a</b> <b>Remotely</b> <b>Operated</b> <b>Vehicle</b> {{are presented in}} the context of the developments of ”IES- Inspection of Underwater Structures” project. The project concerns the design and implementation of an advanced low cost system for the inspection of underwater structures based on <b>a</b> <b>Remotely</b> <b>Operated</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (ROV). First, the sub-systems of the IES system are described. Second, an example of a mission is outlined. Third, the control architecture is briefly sketched and formalized. Fourth, the design of the regu-lation and tracking controllers for this architecture are discussed. The design uses a non-linear Dynamic Surface Controller (DSC). This controller is coupled with a trajectory generation system for optimal performance. The ROV model is differentially flat under mild assumptions. The trajectory generation system uses this property to produce optimal trajectories. Finally, simulation runs of DSC and PID are compared in light of model parameters uncertainty. Extensions of the work are discussed as conclusions...|$|R
