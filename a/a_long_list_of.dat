The United States, acting through the CIA, funded <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> projects to counter the communist appeal among intellectuals in Europe and the developing world. The CIA also covertly sponsored a domestic propaganda campaign called Crusade for Freedom.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{evidence}} that auxiliary common soldiers received individual decorations, although auxiliary officers did. Instead, the whole regiment was honoured by a title reflecting the type of award e.g. torquata (awarded a torque) or armillata (awarded bracelets). Some regiments would, in the course of time, accumulate <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> titles and decorations e.g. cohors I Brittonum Ulpia torquata pia fidelis c.R..|$|E

5|$|Hess {{was obsessed}} with his health {{to the point of}} hypochondria, {{consulting}} many doctors and other practitioners for what he described to his captors in Britain as <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> ailments involving the kidneys, colon, gall bladder, bowels and heart. Like Hitler, Hess was a vegetarian, and he did not smoke or drink. He brought his own food to the Berghof, claiming it was biologically dynamic, but Hitler did not approve of this practice, so he discontinued taking meals with the Führer.|$|E
5|$|The legend that de' Medici {{introduced}} <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> foods, {{techniques and}} utensils from Italy to France {{for the first}} time is a myth routinely discredited by most food historians. Items whose introduction to France have been attributed to Catherine include the dinner fork, parsley, the artichoke, lettuce, broccoli, the garden pea, pasta, Parmesan, as well as the turkey and tomato of the New World. She has also received credit for introducing sauces and a variety of dishes such as duck à l’orange and deviled eggs.|$|E

These concepts would then be handed to his head chef in the morning, who was told to copy them out for future use.|$|E

5|$|Bill C-10 (previously Bill C-33), among <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> {{minor changes}} to tax law {{contained}} a controversial clause {{that would give}} the government power to deny taxation benefits for films made in Canada if the government deems the content to be objectionable. David Cronenberg and Sarah Polley argued it is equivalent to censorship because most Canadian films cannot afford to be produced without government assistance. The Bill was passed in the House October 29, 2007, but opposition parties later said that they did not notice the controversial part and several Senators have said that they intend to send the Bill back to the House.|$|E
5|$|Centaur entered {{operation}} as {{a hospital}} ship on 12 March 1943. The {{early stages of}} Centaur's first voyage as a hospital ship were test and transport runs; the initial run from Melbourne to Sydney resulted in the Master, Chief Engineer, and Chief Medical Officer composing <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> defects requiring attention. Following repairs, she conducted a test run, transporting wounded servicemen from Townsville to Brisbane to ensure that she was capable of fulfilling {{the role of a}} medical vessel. Centaur was then tasked with delivering medical personnel to Port Moresby, New Guinea, and returning to Brisbane with Australian and American wounded along with a small number of wounded Japanese prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|Chris Carter {{also enjoyed}} and found {{inspiration}} in Pink Floyd and Tangerine Dream. Boyd Rice {{was influenced by}} the music of 60's girl groups and tiki culture. Z'EV cited Christopher Tree (Spontaneous Sound), John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Tim Buckley, Jimi Hendrix, and Captain Beefheart, among others together with Tibetan, Balinese, Javanese, Indian, and African music as influential in his artistic life. Cabaret Voltaire cited Roxy Music as their initial forerunners, as well as Kraftwerk's Trans-Europe Express. Cabaret Voltaire also recorded pieces reminiscent of musique concrète and composers such as Morton Subotnick. Nurse with Wound cited <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> obscure free improvisation and Krautrock as recommended listening. 23 Skidoo borrowed from Fela Kuti and Miles Davis's On the Corner. Many industrial groups, including Einstürzende Neubauten, took inspiration from world music.|$|E

5|$|During Titus' {{second visit}} to the {{disaster}} area, a fire struck Rome which lasted for three days. Although {{the extent of the}} damage was not as disastrous as during the Great Fire of 64, crucially sparing the many districts of insulae, Cassius Dio records <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> important public buildings that were destroyed, including Agrippa's Pantheon, the Temple of Jupiter, the Diribitorium, parts of Pompey's Theatre and the Saepta Julia among others. Once again, Titus personally compensated for the damaged regions. According to Suetonius, a plague similarly struck during the fire. The nature of the disease, however, or the death toll are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Having {{existed for}} over 600 years, Gray's Inn has <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> notable members and honorary members. Even as the {{smallest}} of the Inns of Court it has had members who have been particularly noted lawyers and judges, such as Francis Bacon, The 1st Earl of Birkenhead, Baron Slynn, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, Lord Hoffmann and others. Outside the Bar and judiciary of England and Wales, members have included the clergy (including five Archbishops of Canterbury), industrialists like John Wynne, astronomers such as John Lee, media figures, like Huw Thomas, and members of the Bar and judiciary of other nations, such as Sir Ti-liang Yang (former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Hong Kong), B.

5000|$|From {{the days}} of the Spanish conquest, some Filipinos had {{received}} Spanish surnames. Most people, however, had no surnames, which caused confusion. On Wednesday, November 21, 1849, Clavería issued a decree sending <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> Spanish and local surnames to the chiefs of the provinces. These were sent out to the different towns, and given to the locals who had no surnames. In many towns, all the names for people in that town began with the same letter of the alphabet. [...] For instance, surnames starting with [...] "A" [...] applies for those who lived in Alimodian while those starting [...] "M" [...] apply for those who lived in Miagao.|$|R
5|$|The 1891 {{constitution}} added {{a provision}} that the governor must specify the reason for any specially-called legislative session, and that no other business could be considered during the session. There is, however, no constitutional requirement that the legislature conduct any business during the called session. In 2007, Republican governor Ernie Fletcher called the Assembly into session to consider <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> items. The Democratically-controlled House of Representatives maintained {{that none of the}} items were urgent enough that they could not wait until the regular session convened; they claimed that Fletcher was calling the session only to boost his sagging poll numbers before the upcoming election in which he faced a challenge from Democrat Steve Beshear. The House convened on the day appointed and adjourned an hour later without transacting any business.|$|E
5|$|The {{ban on the}} NSDAP {{was lifted}} in early 1928, {{in time for the}} Reichstag elections, held on 20 May. Results were poor, with the NSDAP losing nearly 100,000 voters and earning only 2.6 per cent of the vote nationwide. Results in Berlin were even worse, where they {{attained}} only 1.4 per cent of the vote. Goebbels was one of twelve NSDAP members to gain election to the Reichstag. This gave him immunity from prosecution for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> outstanding charges, including a three-week jail sentence he received in April for insulting the deputy police chief Weiß. The Reichstag changed the immunity regulations in February 1931, and Goebbels was forced to pay fines for libellous material he had placed in Der Angriff {{over the course of the}} previous year.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} the episode {{developed}} from writer Jon Vitti {{coming up with}} <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> bad things Bart would do for attention imagining the potential consequences. The only idea that developed into an interesting episode concept was Bart cheating on an IQ test. This idea {{was based on an}} incident from Vitti's childhood when a number of his classmates did not take an intelligence test seriously and suffered poor academic treatment because of it. Because Bart was already obviously unintelligent, Vitti reversed the problem for his episode. Vitti used all his memories of elementary school behavior to produce a draft script of 71 pages, substantially above the required length of about 45 pages.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{negative}} effects of poison, which were so evident in these times, cures were being found in poison, even at such a time where it was hated by the most of the general public. An example {{can be found in the}} works of Iranian born Persian physician, philosopher, and scholar Rhazes, writer of Secret of Secrets, which was <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> chemical compounds, minerals and appratus, the first man to distil alcohol and use it as an anti-septic, and the person who suggested mercury be used as a laxative. He made discoveries relating to a mercury chloride called corrosive sublimate. An ointment derived from this sublimate was used to cure what Rhazes described as 'the itch', which is now referred to as scabies. This proved an effective treatment because of mercury's poisonous nature and ability to penetrate the skin, allowing it to eliminate the disease and the itch.|$|E
5|$|Jaco Van Dormael hired {{visual effects}} {{supervisor}} Louis Morin, {{known for his}} work in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), to create visual effects for Mr. Nobody. All five hundred visual effects shots were produced in Quebec by Quebec companies. Modus FX announced having delivered 121 digital visual effects shots for the film. The company was entrusted with complex sequences which could not be captured on film, involving the digital reproduction of entire cities, villages and other-worldly settings. Modus FX also worked on several complex transitions between the different worlds and multiple lives of Nemo Nobody. Modus FX's post-production contributions involved 37 digital artists and technicians across a six-month period. <b>A</b> <b>long</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> software, including Autodesk's Softimage and Maya, Side Effects' Houdini and The Foundry's Nuke, {{and the creation of a}} multitude of in-house tools, programs and techniques was required for the shots delivered.|$|E
5|$|Overall, John II Komnenos {{left the}} empire {{a great deal}} better off than he had found it. Substantial territories had been recovered, and his successes against the invading Petchenegs, Serbs and Seljuk Turks, along with his {{attempts}} to establish Byzantine suzerainty over the Crusader States in Antioch and Edessa, did much to restore the reputation of his empire. His careful, methodical approach to warfare had protected the empire from the risk of sudden defeats, while his determination and skill had allowed him to rack up <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> successful sieges and assaults against enemy strongholds. By {{the time of his}} death, he had earned near universal respect, even from the Crusaders, for his courage, dedication and piety. His early death meant his work went unfinished; historian Zoe Oldenbourg speculates that his last campaign might well have resulted in real gains for Byzantium and the Christian cause.|$|E
