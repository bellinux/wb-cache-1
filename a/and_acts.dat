Each shift has seen a new set of imperatives for schools and teacher education.

Such a move has implications for educational policy, and for both school and classroom practice. In turn, this shift identifies implications for the education of teachers and school leaders. The paper identifies what some of these changes might be and what teacher education needs to do to prepare teachers and school leaders for an increasingly complex future. Full Tex...|$|R
5|$|Flux-cored, {{self-shielding}} or gasless wire-fed welding {{had been}} developed for simplicity and portability. This avoids the gas system of conventional GMAW and uses a cored wire containing a solid flux. This flux vaporises during welding and produces a plume of shielding gas. Although described as a 'flux', this compound has little activity <b>and</b> <b>acts</b> mostly as an inert shield. The wire is of slightly larger diameter than for a comparable gas-shielded weld, to allow room for the flux. The smallest available is 0.8mm diameter, compared to 0.6mm for solid wire. The shield vapor is slightly active, rather than inert, so the process is always MAGS but not MIG (inert gas shield). This limits the process to steel and not aluminium.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Two key {{measures}} {{of high school}} performance in Texas public schools are performance on the exit-level Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) and performance on the SAT I <b>and</b> <b>ACT.</b> Between 1994 <b>and</b> 2002, TAAS scores increased substantially, whereas SAT I <b>and</b> <b>ACT</b> scores remained essentially stable. This report reviews differences between the TAAS and the SAT I <b>and</b> <b>ACT</b> examinations that contributed to differences in performance trends, namely (1) purpose and type of test; (2) examinee population; and (3) academic proficiency level assessed. Because of these differences, the assessments are valuable, but distinct, measures of high school performance. The gains in exit-level TAAS scores indicate that an increasing percentage of students were mastering the academic skills required to obtain {{a high school diploma}} in Texas. The essentially stable SAT I <b>and</b> <b>ACT</b> performance indicates that high school students in Texas maintained a stable level of college readiness, relative to the mean performance of the national norm groups for the SAT I <b>and</b> <b>ACT...</b>|$|R
