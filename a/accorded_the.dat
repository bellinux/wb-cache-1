40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Accord</b> {{was hailed}} as a {{breakthrough}} agreement that would bring the ALP and the union movement together {{in a way that}} would benefit the whole of Australia. Subsequent <b>Accord</b> agreements changed <b>the</b> original premise and caused much debate over the on-going value of such an agreement. Although there was criticism throughout the years of <b>the</b> <b>Accord,</b> <b>the</b> end of <b>the</b> <b>Accord</b> created a certain type of literature that revised thinking about <b>the</b> <b>Accord,</b> with many condemning the agreement as a failure. There is some evidence to suggest that <b>the</b> <b>Accord</b> has left a residual bitterness on the part of some in the union movement. There are also many unanswered questions in relation to <b>the</b> <b>Accord,</b> such as why the union movement, or more specifically the ACTU, accepted <b>the</b> <b>Accord</b> in <b>the</b> first place. This paper, however, is more particularly concerned with the effect of <b>the</b> <b>Accord</b> on <b>the</b> current relationship between the ACTU and the ALP...|$|R

5|$|Bennett {{received}} honorary {{degrees from}} the universities of Cambridge (1867) and Oxford (1870). The Philharmonic Society awarded him its Beethoven gold medal in 1867.

The money subscribed at this event founded a scholarship and prize at the RAM, which is still awarded. An English Heritage blue plaque has been placed at the house in 38 Queensborough Terrace, London, where Bennett lived during many of his later years.|$|E

5|$|By 1200, the Swiss plateau {{comprised}} the dominions {{of the houses}} of Savoy, Zähringer, Habsburg, and Kyburg. Some regions (Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, later known as Waldstätten) were <b>accorded</b> <b>the</b> Imperial immediacy to grant the empire direct control over the mountain passes. With the extinction of its male line in 1263 the Kyburg dynasty fell in AD 1264; then the Habsburgs under King Rudolph I (Holy Roman Emperor in 1273) laid claim to the Kyburg lands and annexed them extending their territory to the eastern Swiss plateau.|$|E
5|$|In James Monroe's annual {{address to}} the {{legislature}} in December 1822, he called on Congress to report on how to best deal with the Seminoles that inhabited the recently acquired territory of Florida. As chair of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Metcalfe delivered the report on February 21, 1823. His committee found that, {{under the terms of}} the Adams-Onis Treaty that transferred control of Florida to the United States from Spain, the Seminoles were to be <b>accorded</b> <b>the</b> same privileges as U.S. citizens. Accordingly, the committee recommended that each Seminole family be given a land grant. They hoped that this would help break the tribal loyalties of the Seminoles and expedite their amalgamation into white society. The committee's report was largely ignored.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the evidence of the}} Chronicle that Æthelberht was <b>accorded</b> <b>the</b> title of bretwalda, there is evidence of his domination in several of the southern kingdoms of the Heptarchy. In Essex, Æthelberht appears to have been in a position to exercise authority shortly after 604, when his intervention helped in the conversion of King Sæberht of Essex, his nephew, to Christianity. It was Æthelberht, and not Sæberht, who built and endowed St. Pauls in London, where St Paul's Cathedral now stands. Further evidence is provided by Bede, who explicitly describes Æthelberht as Sæberht's overlord.|$|E
5|$|On {{its return}} to England the {{expedition}} was coolly received by London's geographical establishment which was resentful of the pre-emption {{of a role}} they envisaged for their own National Antarctic (Discovery) Expedition. There were also questions about Borchgrevink's leadership qualities, and criticism of the limited amounts of scientific information which the expedition provided. Despite the groundbreaking achievements in Antarctic survival and travel, Borchgrevink was never <b>accorded</b> <b>the</b> heroic status of Scott or Shackleton, and his expedition was soon forgotten in the dramas which surrounded these and other Heroic Age explorers. However, Roald Amundsen, conqueror of the South Pole in 1911, acknowledged that Borchgrevink's expedition had removed the greatest obstacles to Antarctic travel, and had {{opened the way for}} all the expeditions that followed.|$|E
5|$|Although the Privy Council is {{primarily}} a British institution, officials from some other Commonwealth realms are also appointed. By 2000, the most notable instance was New Zealand, whose Prime Minister, senior politicians, Chief Justice and Court of Appeal Justices were traditionally appointed Privy Counsellors. However, appointments of New Zealand members have since been discontinued. The Prime Minister, the Speaker, the Governor-General and the Chief Justice of New Zealand are still <b>accorded</b> <b>the</b> style Right Honourable, but without membership of the Council. Until the late 20th century, the Prime Ministers and Chief Justices of Canada and Australia were also appointed Privy Counsellors. Canada also has its own Privy Council, the Queen's Privy Council for Canada (see below). Prime Ministers of some other Commonwealth countries that retain the Queen as their sovereign continue to be sworn of the Council.|$|E

5|$|Following Andriamihaja's death, the {{influence}} of Radama's old guard of progressives was eclipsed by that of conservative advisers at court, who grew ever closer to the queen, eventually resulting in Ranavalona's marriage to sampy guardian and conservative figurehead Field Marshal Rainiharo (also called Ravoninahitriniarivo) of Ilafy in 1833. Rainiharo gained initial access to the court through his father, Andriantsilavonandriana, a hova (commoner) who had exceptionally been <b>accorded</b> <b>the</b> privilege of joining King Andrianampoinimerina's inner circle of noble advisers. Field Marshal Rainiharo served as the queen's First Minister from 1830 to 1832, then Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief from 1832 to 1852. Upon Rainiharo's death, the queen wed another conservative, Field Marshal Andrianisa (also called Rainijohary), who remained Ranavalona's husband until her death in 1861. He served as Prime Minister from 1852 to 1862 before being exiled to the royal city of Ambohimanga {{for his part in}} a plot against the queen's son, Radama II.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, the Simon Commission {{which was}} {{appointed}} {{to report on the}} working of the progress of the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms landed in India. The Swarajya Party moved a resolution to boycott the Commission and this was passed 61 to 50 with 12 remaining neutral. The Justice Party and the Swarajists supported the resolution while the Chief Minister P. Subbarayan opposed it and requested his ministers to resign. However, Lord Goschen, the Governor, was able to obtain the support of the Raja of Panagal by making a Justice Party member, M. Krishnan Nair, a Cabinet minister. Led by the Raja of Panagal, the Justice Party switched sides and lent its support to the Subbarayan government. Soon afterwards, the Justice Party passed a resolution welcoming the Simon Commission. The Simon Commission visited Madras on 28 February 1928 and 18 February 1929 and was boycotted by the Swarajya Party and the Indian National Congress. However, the Justicites and the Subbarayan Government <b>accorded</b> <b>the</b> Commission a warm reception.|$|E
5|$|On 28 February 1922, the United Kingdom {{issued a}} {{declaration}} through which it unilaterally ended its protectorate over Egypt.

Egyptian nationalist leader Saad Zaghlul maintained that the reason for the change of title from Sultan (equivalent to emperor) to the lesser title of King was because the British would not recognize an independent Egyptian ruler whose title was superior to their own monarch.|$|E
