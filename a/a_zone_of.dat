5|$|Cyclone Favio {{originated}} from <b>a</b> <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> disturbed weather that was first classified by the Météo-France office on Réunion (MFR) at 1200 UTC February11, 2007. Twelve hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued their first advisory on the system. Midday on February12, MFR upgraded the system into a tropical disturbance {{and noted that}} its rating at that time on the Dvorak technique was 2.0.|$|E
5|$|In meteorology, a cyclone is a {{large scale}} air mass that rotates around a strong center of low {{atmospheric}} pressure. Cyclones are characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate about <b>a</b> <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> low pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest scale (the synoptic scale). Warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Favio was {{the first}} known {{tropical}} cyclone that passed south of Madagascar to strike Africa as an intense tropical cyclone. Early on February11, 2007, <b>a</b> <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> disturbed weather formed east of Madagascar. Four days later, Favio was named as intensified to a moderate tropical storm while moving southwest. On February18, the storm was upgraded into a severe tropical storm. Then, it turned west {{in the general direction}} of Mozambique. Continuing to intensify, Favio was upgraded to a tropical cyclone early on February19. Subsequently, the storm began to undergo rapid deepening; the small storm reached intense tropical cyclone status the next day before peaking in intensity. However, the cyclone had weakened somewhat prior to making landfall on February22 in the Inhambane Province in Mozambique. It rapidly weakened over land and dissipated the next day.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the {{confluence}} of the Vohimara and Antainambalana Rivers may have been <b>a</b> <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> hybridization between these two species, although no conclusive results have indicated current interbreeding. In general, the Antainambalana River appears to isolate the red ruffed lemurs from the neighboring subspecies of black-and-white ruffed lemur, V. v. subcincta. The subspecies V. v. variegata can be found further south, and V. v. editorum is the southernmost subspecies. The ranges of these two southern subspecies overlap and intermediate forms are reported to exist, although this has not been confirmed.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} <b>a</b> <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> buffer states, Sigismund I of Hungary tried to draw the neighboring Orthodox rulers under his own suzerainty by granting them estates in his kingdom. For example, Stefan Lazarević of Serbia received Satu Mare, Baia Mare and Baia Sprie in modern Romania, and Mircea I of Wallachia was granted Făgăraş. Sigismund I {{was also the first}} monarch who recognized, in 1419, the legislative competence of the Estates in Transylvania. On his initiative, their assembly declared that in case of an Ottoman attack, every third nobleman and every tenth serf would take up arms. Indeed, from 1420 Ottoman attacks occurred on an annual basis. In this period many Saxon churches, and later the Székely churches of the Ciuc region, were fortified, which gave local architecture a distinctive appearance.|$|E
5|$|On December25, a {{cold front}} dragged over the central Mozambique Channel. A weak {{circulation}} {{formed in the}} Channel and moderate convection appeared on December27. Then on December30, RSMC La Reunion designated this low pressure as <b>a</b> <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> disturbed weather and was classified as a tropical depression on January1, 2002. The JTWC also issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) early on December31 and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 08S the next day. As it moved further eastwards it strengthened quickly from a tropical depression into a severe tropical storm, with the Meteorological Services of Madagascar giving it the name Cyprien on January1. Cyprien soon became {{a serious threat to}} western Madagascar. Convection began to dissipate as wind shear increased and that resulted in quick weakening to a tropical depression. As it made landfall on western Madagascar, it dropped heavy rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{consolidated}} much of {{his power}} in Shropshire and Herefordshire at Bridgnorth Castle, often using that site {{as a place of}} business in preference to Shrewsbury, which had previously been the main centre of business for his predecessors as sheriff. As well as Waleran, Pain imprisoned a Welsh hostage there in 1128, Llywelyn ab Owain, the nephew of Maredudd ap Bleddyn, ruler of the Welsh principality of Powys. Besides Bridgnorth, Pain used his possession of Ludlow Castle to consolidate his power in the Welsh Marches. During Henry's reign, the Welsh border was <b>a</b> <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> frequent raids and conflict between the Anglo-Normans and the Welsh.|$|E

5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{occurred in}} the Virginia Seismic Zone, located in the Piedmont region. The Virginia Piedmont area was formed originally as part of <b>a</b> <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> repeated continental collisions that created the ancestral Appalachian Mountains, a process that started during the Ordovician period with the Taconic orogeny and finished during the Carboniferous Period with the Alleghanian orogeny. The reverse faults formed during the various orogenies were partly reactivated as normal faults in extension during the Mesozoic Era as the supercontinent Pangaea broke apart. During the Cenozoic Era, compression from the opening and spreading of the Atlantic has caused some of these structures to be reactivated in a reverse sense.|$|E
5|$|The first {{storm of}} the season {{originated}} from an area of convection east of Diego Garcia in early October 2001. Moving southwestward, it slowly organized, with convection developing around a weak circulation. Late on October3, MFR classified the system as <b>a</b> <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> disturbed weather. On October5, the agency re-classified it as a tropical disturbance and later as Tropical Depression 1. The circulation was partially exposed due to wind shear, although it had good outflow. The JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 01S at 0600UTC on October6, estimating winds of about 65km/h (40mph). Due to the shear, the convection gradually diminished, prompting the MFR to downgrade it to a tropical disturbance on October7. The next day, the JTWC issued its last advisory, noting that the system was dissipating.|$|E
5|$|In late April 2002, {{an area of}} convection, or thunderstorms, persisted to the west-southwest of Diego Garcia in the south-central Indian Ocean, {{associated}} with a trough near the equator. The system had a broad circulation, and initially moved slowly to the east-southeast. It developed due {{to an increase in}} the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO), which moved eastward across the Indian Ocean. The same system spawned a disturbance in the northern Indian Ocean that later struck Oman as a tropical cyclone. Such simultaneous systems in opposite hemispheres occasionally occur in the spring or autumn; in May 2002, the powerful MJO pulse produced two such sets of storms, later producing a set in the eastern Indian Ocean that became a deep depression that struck Myanmar and Tropical Storm Errol to the southwest of Indonesia. On April30, Météo-France (MFR) classified the system as <b>a</b> <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> disturbed weather. It slowly organized, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert late on May2, around the time that MFR classified it as Tropical Disturbance14. The thunderstorms became more concentrated around an increasingly well-defined center, and with minimal wind shear, the system strengthened into Tropical Depression14 on May3. That day, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone23S.|$|E

5|$|The {{eminence}} {{achieved by}} East Anglia under Rædwald {{did not last}} long, as his dynasty fell victim to the rising power of Penda of Mercia and his successors. Throughout the mid-seventh to early ninth centuries, Mercian power grew until a vast region from the River Thames to the Humber, including East Anglia and the south-east, became <b>a</b> <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> Mercian hegemony. In the early 640s Penda defeated and killed both Ecgric and Sigeberht, who was later venerated as a saint. Ecgric's successor Anna and Anna's son Jurmin were killed together in 654 at the Battle of Bulcamp, near Blythburgh. Having eliminated Anna's challenge to his rising power, Penda then subjected the East Anglians to Mercian overlord-ship. In 655 Æthelhere of East Anglia joined Penda in a campaign against Oswiu, which ended in a disastrous Mercian defeat at the Battle of the Winwaed, in which both Penda and his ally Æthelhere were killed.|$|E
5|$|This {{model has}} Siletzia forming on the {{continental}} margin along {{what is now}} the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament (OWL; <b>a</b> <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> topographical features of unknown age and tectonic significance), with the southern end of Siletzia and the Klamath Mountains (joined to Siletzia) near the Idaho Batholith in central Idaho. Further evidence for this comes from the sand of the Tyee Formation that overlie the Roseburg Formation. Not only does this sand have the same isotopic composition of rock in the Idaho Batholith (and of sand now coursing down the Snake and Columbia Rivers), but it appears to have not been transported very far from its source. This implies that the Tyee Formation was much closer to the Idaho Batholith when it was deposited, and subsequently rotated away. Geodetic surveys show that the region continues to rotate, likely as a result of extension of the Basin and Range Province and asthenospheric flow around the southern edge of the subducting Juan de Fuca plate.|$|E

5|$|After gaining {{valuable}} {{experience in}} amphibious assaults and inland fighting, Allied planners {{returned to the}} plans to invade Northern France, now postponed to 1944. Under the direction of General Dwight D. Eisenhower (Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force) and Frederick Morgan, plans for the invasion of France coalesced as Operation Overlord. With an initial target date of 1 May 1944, the infantry attack was conceived as a joint assault by five divisions transported by landing craft, constituting the largest amphibious operation in military history. The attack was later scheduled for Monday, 5 June 1944, and Normandy was selected for the landing sites, with <b>a</b> <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> operations extending from the Cotentin Peninsula to Caen. There were originally seventeen sectors along the Normandy coastline with codenames taken {{from one of the}} spelling alphabets of the time, from Able, west of Omaha, to Rodger on the east flank of the invasion area. Eight further sectors were added when the planned invasion was extended to include Utah on the Cotentin Peninsula. Sectors were further subdivided into beaches identified by the colours Green, Red and White. Operation Overlord called for the British Second Army to assault between the River Orne and Port en Bessin, capture Caen, and form a front line from Caumont-l'Éventé to the south-east of Caen, to acquire airfields and protect the left flank of the United States First Army while it captured Cherbourg. Possession of Caen and its surroundings would give Second Army a suitable staging area for a push south to capture the city of Falaise, which could then be used as a pivot for a swing left to advance on Argentan, the Touques River and then towards the River Seine.|$|E
