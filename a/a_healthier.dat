Evidence that a vampire was active in a given locality included death of cattle, sheep, relatives or neighbours. Folkloric vampires could also make their presence felt by engaging in minor poltergeist-like activity, such as hurling stones on roofs or moving household objects, and pressing on people in their sleep.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} {{published}} illustrations, {{which may have}} been drawn by Raspe himself, the Baron appears slim and youthful. For the 1792 Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen, an anonymous artist drew the Baron as a dignified but tired old soldier whose face is marred by injuries from his adventures; this illustration remained the standard portrait of the Baron for about seventy years, and its imagery was echoed in Cruikshank's depictions of the character. Doré, illustrating a Théophile Gautier fils translation in 1862, retained the sharply beaked nose and twirled moustache from the 1792 portrait, but gave the Baron <b>a</b> <b>healthier</b> and more affable appearance; the Doré Baron became the definitive visual representation for the character.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the grass}} on the putting greens was the wide-bladed Bermuda. The greens lost speed, {{especially}} during the late 1970s, after the introduction of <b>a</b> <b>healthier</b> strain of narrow-bladed Bermuda, which thrived and grew thicker. In 1978, the greens on the par 3 course were reconstructed with bentgrass, a narrow-bladed species that could be mowed shorter, eliminating grain. After this test run, the greens on the main course were replaced with bentgrass {{in time for the}} 1981 Masters. The bentgrass resulted in significantly faster putting surfaces, which has required a reduction in some of the contours of the greens over time.|$|E

5|$|Located {{within an}} area of {{moderate}} southwesterly wind shear, the depression was slow to organize; early on October 14, a clear center was not depicted on Infrared satellite imagery. The depression moved to the west-northwest and gradually strengthened into Tropical Storm Nicholas late on October 14 while located 1,200miles (1,930km) east of the Windward Islands. On October 15, deep convection became much better organized, though the center of Nicholas remained displaced from the deepest of the shower activity. Despite the shear, the storm continued to strengthen as it moved to the west-northwest, a motion caused by a mid-level ridge to its north. On October 16, Nicholas transitioned from a sheared, unorganized system to a more organized system, {{as a result of}} banding features and improvement in its convective pattern due to lesser amounts of vertical shear and <b>a</b> <b>healthier</b> anticyclone over the storm. Nicholas continued to strengthen, and attained a peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h) on October 17 while located 875miles (1,410km) east of the Leeward Islands. Dvorak estimates suggested Nicholas potentially attained hurricane status, though microwave images of the storm showed a sheared system without any evidence of an eye feature.|$|E

5|$|Mills {{took over}} as manager of Second Division Notts County on 9 January 2004 after the {{resignation}} of Bill Dearden, with the club lying 23rd in the Second Division table. His first match in charge came just a day later, in which Marc Goodfellow scored a stoppage time winner for Bristol City as County were beaten 2–1 at home. After a run of good form from late February to early March 2004 County rose out of the relegation zone, but a run of one victory from the last 12 matches of 2003–04 saw the club relegated to League Two in 23rd place. Despite having <b>a</b> <b>healthier</b> playing budget and a reorganisation of the squad {{during the summer of}} 2004, County made a disappointing start to 2004–05. As a result, Mills was dismissed on 4 November 2004 with the club 21st in League Two, and he declined the offer of a lesser position with the club. He resumed his playing career during early 2005 with Northern Counties East League Premier Division club Glapwell, playing under Lee Wilson, who Mills had previously played with and managed.|$|E
5|$|The plague in London largely {{affected}} the poor, as the rich {{were able to}} leave the city by either retiring to their country estates or residing with kin {{in other parts of the}} country. The subsequent Great Fire of London, however, ruined many city merchants and property owners. As a result of these events, London was largely rebuilt and Parliament enacted the Rebuilding of London Act 1666. Although the street plan of the capital remained relatively unchanged, some improvements were made: streets were widened, pavements were created, open sewers abolished, wooden buildings and overhanging gables forbidden, and the design and construction of buildings controlled. The use of brick or stone was mandatory and many gracious buildings were constructed. Not only was the capital rejuvenated, but it became <b>a</b> <b>healthier</b> environment in which to live.

40|$|The {{formation}} of <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> lifestyle among {{the educational process}} subjects {{is one of the}} main functions of health-saving educational space. This function can be implemented effectively only if the executive bodies in the sphere of education, other agencies, the public and the subjects of the educational process take active part in this process. Such cooperation requires a common understanding in the issues to promote health of all pedagogical process participants, but to date the concept “healthy lifestyle” has not been clearly defined and the effective and optimized pedagogical models for its formation, according to the cross-cutting principle, have not been elaborated. The article analyzes different points of view on this issue. <b>A</b> <b>healthy</b> lifestyle is considered as a complex pedagogical technology to create health culture. Taking into account the scholars’ attitudes to the concept “healthy lifestyle” the author identifies three main components of <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> lifestyle: health culture, health-saving activity and conditions that ensure <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> lifestyle. The article argues that health saving needs of a person predetermine his/her health-saving activities.

The work presents the normative model of <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> lifestyle and its structure. It defines <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> lifestyle as <b>a</b> model of health-saving behavior model.
