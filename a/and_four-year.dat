25|$|The former {{system of}} basic {{education}} in the Philippines consists of one-year preschool education, six-year elementary education <b>and</b> <b>four-year</b> high school education. Although public preschool, {{elementary and high school}} education are provided free, only primary education is stipulated as compulsory according to the 1987 Philippine Constitution. Pre-primary education caters to children aged five. A child aged six may enter elementary schools with, or without pre-primary education. Following on from primary education is four-years of secondary education, which can theoretically be further divided into three years of lower secondary and one year of upper secondary education. Ideally, a child enters secondary education at the age of 12. After completing their secondary education, students may progress to a technical education and skills development to earn a certificate or a diploma within one to three years, depending on the skill. Students also have the option to enrol in higher education programmes to earn a baccalaureate degree.|$|E
25|$|The {{curriculum}} and system of graduation were reformed. Entrance examinations that were {{equivalent to the}} School Leaving Certificate were introduced and average ages of entry rose to 17 or 18. Standard patterns of graduation in the arts curriculum offered three-year ordinary <b>and</b> <b>four-year</b> honours degrees. There was resistance among professors, particularly among chairs of divinity and classics, {{to the introduction of}} new subjects, especially the physical sciences. The crown established Regius chairs, all in the sciences, including medicine, chemistry, natural history and botany. The chair of Engineering at Glasgow was {{the first of its kind}} in the world. By the 1870s the physical sciences were well established in Scottish universities, whereas in England the battle to modernise the curriculum would not be complete until the end of the century. The new separate science faculties were able to move away from the compulsory Latin, Greek and philosophy of the old MA curriculum. Under the commissions, all the universities were restructured. They were given Courts, which included external members and who oversaw the finances of the institution. Students' Representative Councils were founded in 1884 and ratified under the 1889 act. Under this act new arts subjects were established, with chairs in Modern History, French, German and Political Economy.|$|E

The president of Montana State University acted as chancellor for the system, while [...] "deans" [...] oversaw the two-year units.

Cruzado said she would place a much greater emphasis on integrating the two-year schools into Montana State University than her predecessor, Geoffrey Gamble, had.
