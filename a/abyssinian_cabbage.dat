50|$|Crambin is a {{small seed}} storage protein from the <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>cabbage.</b> It belongs to thionins. It has 46 {{residues}} (amino acids). It has been extensively studied by X-ray crystallography since its crystals are unique and diffract to a resolution of 0.48 Å. Neutron scattering measurements are available also at a resolution of 1.1 Å, PDB ID 3U7T.|$|E
40|$|H-bonding between protein surface polar/charged {{groups and}} water {{is one of}} the key factors of protein hydration. Here, we {{introduce}} an Accessible Surface Area (ASA) model for computationally efficient estimation of a free energy of water–protein H-bonding at any given protein conformation. The free energy of water–protein H-bonds is estimated using empirical formulas describing probabilities of hydrogen bond formation that were derived from molecular dynamics simulations of water molecules at the surface of a small protein, Crambin, from the <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>cabbage</b> (Crambe abyssinica) seed. The results suggest that atomic solvation parameters (ASP) widely used in continuum hydration models might be dependent on ASA for polar/charged atoms under consideration. The predictions of the model are found to be in qualitative agreement with the available experimental data on model compounds. This model combines the computational speed of ASA potential, with the high resolution of more sophisticated solvation methods...|$|E
40|$|The general {{designation}} of thionins {{has been proposed}} {{for a family of}} homologous peptides that includes purothionins, which were first isolated from wheat seeds (Balls el #/., 1942) and their homologues from various taxa that have been named viscotoxins and crambins (see Garcia-Olmedo el al., 1989). The crystalline protein material obtained from lipid extracts of wheat endosperm was designated "purothionins" because of its high sulphur content (Balls el al., 1942). This material was found to have bactericidal and fungicidal properties (Stuart and Harris, 1942), to inhibit fermentation of wheat mashes (Balls and Harris, 1944), and to be toxic to laboratory animals (Coulson el al„ 1942). The toxic properties of mistletoes were ascribed to the viscumin lectin and to a mixture of small basic proteins, designated - "viscotoxins" (Samuelsson, 1974). In a study of the seeds of the <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>cabbage</b> {Crambe abyssinica) ^ a high-sulphur crystalline protein was obtained from the aqueous acetone extracts and designated "crambin" (Van Ettcn e/<?/., 1965) ...|$|E
