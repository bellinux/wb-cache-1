5|$|By 1805, {{during the}} War of the Third Coalition, the Polish troops in Italy had been renamed the 1st Polish Legion (1e Legion Polonaise) and {{attached}} to the Kingdom of Italy. In 1806, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> of the old Dąbrowski and Kniaziewicz's Legions was one demi-brigade, consisting of one infantry regiment and one cavalry regiment, now {{in the service of}} the Kingdom of Naples. It fought at Castel Franco, turning the Austrian attack on 24 November 1805, but on 3 July 1806 it suffered a severe defeat at Sant'Eufemia a Maiella. Many Polish officers served in French army or allied formations.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of Mario, Naka wanted Sonic {{to take over the}} American market. Sonic's default speed was set to that of Mario while running. Tests were run using the Genesis' tool library, and problems such as flickering, slow frame rates, and shaky animation soon became apparent. Increasing Sonic's speed caused animation problems. Naka solved the problem by developing an algorithm that enabled the animation to retain fluidity. Sonic was able to cross levels quickly without the animation slowing down, and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> was the optimization of the game's speed to adhere to the staff's expectations. The team then noticed that different people had different perceptions of the game's speed: some believed it was too fast, which caused disagreements. As a result, the game was slowed down.|$|E
5|$|On July 29 the 1st Battalion {{suffered}} {{about 60}} casualties from North Korean mortar fire. As {{the men were}} preparing their perimeter defense for the night, a general panic arose, {{for reasons that are}} still unclear. Most of them deserted their positions in a state of alarm. Colonel White found himself, the 77th Combat Engineer Company, and a battery of the 159th Field Artillery Battalion <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> in the front line. He had to personally reorganize the battalion as many of his officers were unable to get the men to listen to them. As White tried to rally his men, the field artillery maintained a sustained barrage of fire to slow the North Koreans advance. That night alone the artillery fired 3,000 rounds in holding back the North Koreans.|$|E

5|$|The {{graphic design}} {{was decided to}} be {{modelled}} from those of cartoons, and a goal was to have two thousand character animations. Another artist was hired to complete the graphics on time, and the team ultimately ended up with four. Fellow artist Andy Bass had difficulty getting the Kit-Kat graphics correct. He {{said they did not}} have the right colour, so Carr tweaked the palette. Bass modelled the vending machine that would use the Kit-Kat graphics and used 3D Studio to render it into the game palette, which he then edited using Deluxe Paint. By spring 1996, around half of the illnesses and animations were complete, the introduction and cutscenes were mostly complete, and the programming of the management system was almost finished. By early 1997, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> was refining the difficulty levels.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Sherwood's sons put {{her body}} near the fireplace, and a wind {{came down the}} chimney. Her body {{disappeared}} amid the embers, with the only clue being a cloven hoofprint. Sherwood lies in an unmarked grave under some trees in a field near the intersection of Pungo Ferry Road and Princess Anne Road in Virginia Beach. Stories about the Devil taking her body, unnatural storms, and loitering black cats quickly arose after her death, and local men killed every feline they could find; this widespread killing of cats might have caused the infestation of rats and mice recorded in Princess Anne County in 1743. Her home on Muddy Creek stood for over 200 years. After being burned {{several times in the}} 20th century by vandals, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> in 2002 were the brick chimneys, which were bulldozed in November 2002. All that remains are a few bricks and part of the foundation, which is overgrown. The property is now owned by the Federal Government as part of Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E

25|$|With the {{annexation}} of Decebalus' kingdom, Dacia {{was turned into}} Rome's newest province, only the second such acquisition {{since the death of}} Augustus nearly a century before. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> to deal with were Decebalus' Sarmatian allies to the north, requiring a number of campaigns that did not cease until 107 at the earliest; however, by the end of 106, the legions began erecting new Castra along the frontiers.

25|$|By 1845, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> of the Stourbridge Lion was its boiler. The boiler {{was still}} functional, however, {{and it was}} used in a foundry in Carbondale for about another five years until the foundry's owner headed west to try his luck as a Forty-niner. The foundry was sold {{a few years later}} to new owners who {{recognized}} the boiler's value as a piece of history, and reportedly tried to sell it for $1,000 (equal to $ today) in 1874. The owners weren't able to find a buyer so they hung onto it themselves.|$|E
25|$|Pigeard {{stated that}} Blücher {{surrendered}} {{with a total}} of 8,000 to 9,000 men, with 80 artillery pieces, which constituted <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> of his army corps. The Prussian foot units that lost flags (in parentheses) were the Infantry Regiments Kuhnheim Nr. 1 (4), Kalckreuth Nr. 4 (4), Alt-Larisch Nr. 26 (2), Borcke Nr. 30 (4), and Kauffberg Nr. 51 (4). The cavalry regiments losing standards were the Beeren Cuirassiers Nr. 2 (5), Katte Dragoons Nr. 4 (2), Königin Dragoons Nr. 5 (1), Hertzberg Dragoons Nr. 9 (5), Heyking Dragoons Nr. 10 (5), and Wobeser Dragoons Nr. 14 (1).|$|E

25|$|Pigment used in {{paintings}} were imported from Fukien {{and used in}} textile dyeing. To achieve the color white, ground chalk or powdered shells were used. Other colors were achieved using cochineal, vermilion, arsenic, and sulphur. Some patterns can use up to 18 different color applications. After the kingdom was under Japanese rule, the Okinawans could no longer trade for these pigments and sought new ways to continue with their painting. Production of the finer and brighter bingata {{had come to a}} halt and the workers turned to working with the materials which were readily available. Indigo was <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>left,</b> so production for the general public became popular.|$|E
25|$|Captain Thomas Wakefield {{received}} a letter of marque on 9 November 1798. On 4 December he sailed from the Downs, bound for Bombay and China. Only five days later, on 9 December, Henry Addison struck the Bembridge Ledge on the Isle of Wight, during a heavy fog. When the tide went out {{the next day she}} bilged. Five crew member drowned while trying to reach shore on a raft. Also, a block falling from the mizzen mast hit a boy on the head, killing him. By 16 December <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> standing was the forepart of the vessel's upper works. Some casks were saved, but the EIC put the value of the cargo it lost at £29,222.|$|E
25|$|The Army Corps of Engineers built a {{cofferdam}} around Maine {{and pumped}} water out from inside it. By 30 June 1911, Maines main deck was exposed. The ship forward of frame 41 was entirely destroyed; a twisted mass of steel {{out of line}} {{with the rest of the}} hull, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> of the bow, bore no resemblance to a ship. The rest of the wreck was badly corroded. Army engineers dismantled the damaged superstructure and decks, which were then dumped at sea. About halfway between bow and stern, they built a concrete and wooden bulkhead to seal the after-section, then cut away what was left of the forward portion. Holes were cut in the bottom of the after-section, through which jets of water were pumped, to break the mud seal holding the ship, then plugged, with flood cocks, which would later be used for sinking the ship.|$|E

25|$|After this match, Jericho {{entered a}} rivalry with Goldberg, which {{was fueled by}} Goldberg's refusal to fight Jericho in WCW. During Jericho's first episode of the Highlight Reel, an {{interview}} segment, where Goldberg was the guest, he complained that no-one wanted Goldberg in WWE and continued to insult him in the following weeks. On May 12 on Raw, a mystery assailant attempted to run over Goldberg with a limousine. A week later, Co-Raw General Manager, Stone Cold Steve Austin, interrogated several Raw superstars {{to find out who}} was driving the car. One of the interrogates was Lance Storm, who admitted that he was the assailant. Austin forced Storm into a match with Goldberg, who defeated Storm. After the match, Goldberg forced Storm to admit that Jericho was the superstar who conspired Storm into running him over. On May 26, Goldberg was once again a guest on the Highlight Reel. Jericho expressed jealousy towards Goldberg's success in WCW and felt that since joining WWE, he had achieved everything he had ever wanted in his career and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> was to defeat Goldberg and challenged him to a match. At Bad Blood, Goldberg settled the score with Jericho and defeated him.|$|E
25|$|The {{retribution}} began immediately. Hugh Despenser {{the elder}} {{had been captured}} at Bristol, and despite some attempts by Isabella to protect him, was promptly executed by his Lancastrian enemies– his body was hacked to pieces and fed to the local dogs. The remainder of the former regime were brought to Isabella. Edmund Fitzalan, a key supporter of Edward II and who had received many of Mortimer's confiscated lands in 1322, was executed on 17 November. Hugh Despenser the younger was sentenced to be brutally executed on 24 November, and a huge crowd gathered in anticipation at seeing him die. They dragged him from his horse, stripped him, and scrawled Biblical verses against corruption and arrogance on his skin. He was then dragged into the city, presented to Queen Isabella, Roger Mortimer, and the Lancastrians. Despenser was then condemned to hang as a thief, be castrated, and then to be drawn and quartered as a traitor, his quarters to be dispersed throughout England. Simon of Reading, one of the Despensers' supporters, was hanged next to him, on charges of insulting Isabella. Once {{the core of the}} Despenser regime had been executed, Isabella and Mortimer began to show restraint. Lesser nobles were pardoned and the clerks {{at the heart of the}} government, mostly appointed by the Despensers and Stapleton, were confirmed in office. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> now was the question of Edward II, still officially Isabella's legal husband and lawful king.|$|E
25|$|On {{the third}} day, England powered on, Brunt staking her claim for Player of the Match with a vital, {{powerful}} 52 - her first Test fifty - as she eked out 83 runs with Guha for the tenth wicket, Guha making 31 not out. Leading by 158 on first innings, England got a dream start by dismissing Lisa Keightley for a duck, and wickets just kept falling. Gunn and Brunt took two wickets each as the Australians faltered to 18 for 4, before the twin sisters Kate and Alex Blackwell fought back. However, Isa Guha removed Alex, another two wickets fell, and by tea Australia were 67 for 7. An attritional partnership {{for the seventh}} wicket between Kate Blackwell and Shelley Nitschke, which yielded 112 runs in four hours, carried Australia past 100, but still they were only 21 ahead with three wickets in hand {{at the close of}} day three. The last day started just like England wanted, Katherine Brunt dismissing Kate Blackwell and wicket-keeper Julia Price with successive deliveries, and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> was to take the last wicket. England toiled, but the Australians defended for nearly two hours and faced 35 overs, until number 11 Emma Liddell finally edged behind to Jane Smit and was out for 24. Shelley Nitschke made her second fifty in two Tests and was left stranded on 88 not out, while slow left arm bowler Clare Connor ended with the bowling analysis of 26-20-25-1. Brunt finished with four wickets in the second innings, for a match total of nine for 111.|$|E
