2500|$|On July 29, 1998, Mrs. King {{and her son}} Dexter {{met with}} Justice Department officials. The {{following}} day, Associate Attorney General Raymond Fisher told reporters [...] "We discussed with them orally what kind of process we would follow {{to see if that}} meets their concerns. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> should, but they're thinking about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arachnologists George and Elizabeth Peckham {{commented on}} the {{specimen}} in their 1909 work Revision of the Attidae of North America: [...] "Iridescens B., which Mr. Banks has kindly lent us for examination, is founded upon an example which is not quite mature, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> may be Bettini."

2500|$|When {{questioned}} in 1920 by Rep. Tinkham about why {{all members of}} the Women’s Bureau were unmarried, Van Winkle explained that, “I really do not personally approve of having married women away from their families, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would be bad for the work to have her divided attention, as our work demands our whole attention.” Speaking more generally in 1928, she stated that “the average wage-earning wife is not intelligent enough to manage both home and job,” and “most women who babble of careers would be better off as homemakers.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{secretary}} general of Tuvalu Red Cross, Tataua Pefe, said that lack of rain had caused the contamination of remaining ground water supplies, [...] "It's not safe for consumption...Some animals have died recently <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> because of subterranean water." ...|$|R
5000|$|The ThinkCentre M55 {{received}} a positive review from PC World, with the reviewer stating that [...] "The Lenovo ThinkCentre M55 9BM is a compact and quiet business PC that keeps maintenance simple and makes upgrades easy.

5000|$|The Council {{spokesman}} said, [...] "The bowl {{has not had}} {{any major}} investment {{for a number of}} years. It will become a national stadium, a national facility but in Corporation ownership. It's an exciting project <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> the right place for a national stadium, which will complement the NSC."

60|$|Yes, {{there are}} many points of {{difference}} between civilised people and savages, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> right to point this out very clearly, good reader, because the man at whom you and I are looking just now is a savage.|$|E
50|$|AIDS {{patients}} {{are less likely}} to receive the normal sympathy that sufferers of other diseases receive, and may even be regarded as sinners. Amr Salama said:For example, in Egypt <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> a punishment from God <b>and</b> <b>we</b> should not treat <b>it.</b> <b>We</b> <b>think</b> that they get it from a sin so they deserve <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> very contagious so we don't deal with them in any way. So people die from that more than they die from anything else.|$|R

6000|$|Lawford glanced involuntarily {{towards the}} door that stood in shadow duskily ajar. 'Well,' he said, 'we have talked, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> must be that, until, at least,' he smiled faintly, 'I can come as quietly as your old ghost you told me of; {{and in that case}} it may not be so very long to wait.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everything. We {{know how}} much {{influence}} your name has--one of the old Hatboro' names--in the community, and all that; and {{we do want to}} interest the whole community in our scheme.

60|$|But {{it is fair}} {{to observe}} that all the {{discrepancies}} in the story of the 'warning' are not more numerous, nor more at variance with each other, than remote hearsay reports of any ordinary occurrence are apt to be. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is plain that, if Lord Lyttelton WAS Junius, Mr. Coulton had no right to allege that Junius went and hanged himself, or, in any other way, was guilty of self-murder.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{might be}} done, colonel," [...] he said, quietly; [...] "but it {{is a serious}} matter, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> will <b>think</b> <b>it</b> over, before <b>we</b> give an opinion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Augusta, [...] "the place isn't {{what it used}} to be, <b>and</b> so <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> best to go. Mamma {{has already}} looked at a villa near Torquay, which will suit us delightfully." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 64. This last {{characteristic}} {{is especially}} to be noticed. It is a touching {{proof of the}} influence of early years. Giotto was only ten years old when he was taken from following the sheep. For the rest, as we have above stated, the manipulation of these frescoes is just as far inferior to that of the Podestà chapel as their dimensions are less; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will be found generally that the smaller the work the more rude is Giotto's hand. In this respect he seems to differ from all other masters.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed,--why don't you?" [...] said Cherry, whose good-nature {{was quite}} as {{conspicuous}} as her bad taste. She knew {{now that she}} had vexed Rachel, and was thoroughly sorry that she had done so. If any other girl had quizzed her about her lover it would not have annoyed her, and she had not understood at first that Rachel Ray might be different from herself.

"The chemist is {{advancing}} rapidly {{with his}} part of the work" [...] (Benjamin wrote); [...] "and I have succeeded in putting together a separate portion of the torn writing which makes sense. Comparison of what he has accomplished with what I have accomplished has led to startling conclusions. Unless Mr. Playmore and I are entirely wrong (and God grant we may be so!), there is a serious necessity for your keeping the reconstruction of the letter strictly secret from everybody about you. The disclosures suggested by what has come to light are so heartrending and so dreadful that I cannot bring myself to write about them until I am absolutely obliged to do so. Please forgive me for disturbing you with this news. We are bound, sooner or later, to consult with you in the matter; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> right to prepare your mind for what may be to come." ...|$|E

60|$|Soon {{everything}} {{begins to}} be mixed up below us.

5000|$|The {{album is}} {{produced}} by Atticus Ross (Nine Inch Nails, Jane's Addiction) and Joe Barresi (Queens of the Stone Age, Tool). According to Sanchez, [...] "they have helped us evolve our sound to be more powerful and dynamic than ever <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> definitely our best work to date." [...] Sanchez also states that, [...] "musically, there's a very cinematic tone. There {{is a lot of}} atmosphere on this record, and that's something I've always wanted to incorporate on the other records, but just never could attain it as we have on this one." [...] The album has a notably different sound to it than the band's other work. It includes light elements of psychedelic rock, which are not present in the band's other albums.|$|R
6000|$|... "We do not propose," [...] {{said the}} right hon. gentleman, [...] "that the Constitution of the Orange River Colony should {{necessarily}} {{be the same}} as the Constitution of the Transvaal Colony, either at starting or in the immediate future. It will be dealt with upon its own merits, dealt with separately, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> possible"--I ask the House to mark this--"from the circumstances with which every one is familiar, that an earlier beginning to greater political liberty may be made in the Orange River Colony than in the Transvaal. That {{is due to the fact}} that the Government of the Orange River Colony previous to the war was by common consent a very good Government, and consequently, speaking generally, of course, and not of individuals, we shall find there probably the means to creating a satisfactory administration more quickly than we can do in the case of the Transvaal Colony." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say'st thou?" [...] {{said the}} General, with a grim {{smile on his}} lip, which seemed to {{intimate}} {{that he was not}} quite inaccessible to flattery; [...] "yea, truly, thou dost not lie in that--we have been an instrument. Neither are we, as I have already hinted, so severely bent against those who have striven against us as malignants, as others may be. The parliament-men best know their own interest and their own pleasure; but, to my poor thinking, it is full time to close these jars, and to allow men of all kinds the means of doing service to their country; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will be thy fault if thou art not employed to good purpose for the state and thyself, on condition thou puttest away the old man entirely from thee, and givest thy earnest attention to what I have to tell thee." ...|$|E
60|$|Their {{influence}} is proportionate. As objects of science, they are accessible to few men. Yet {{all men are}} capable of being raised by piety or by passion, into their region. And no man touches these divine natures, without becoming, in some degree, himself divine. Like a new soul, they renew the body. We become physically nimble and lightsome; we tread on air; life is no longer irksome, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will never be so. No man fears age or misfortune or death, in their serene company, for he is transported out of the district of change. Whilst we behold unveiled the nature of Justice and Truth, we learn {{the difference between the}} absolute and the conditional or relative. We apprehend the absolute. As it were, for the first time, we exist. We become immortal, for we learn that time and space are relations of matter; that, with a perception of truth, or a virtuous will, they have no affinity.|$|E
5000|$|Harwell {{also wrote}} popular music. His first {{recorded}} song was [...] "Upside Down" [...] on the Something Stupid album by Homer and Jethro in the mid-1960s. In the liner {{notes of the}} album, it says: [...] "Detroit Tiger baseball announcer wrote this one, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> a fine observation of the world today, {{as seen from the}} press box at Tiger Stadium. We were up there with Ernie one day and from there the world looks upside down. In fact, the Mets were on top in the National League." [...] All told, 66 songs written by Ernie Harwell have been recorded by various artists. [...] "Needless to say, I have more no-hitters than Nolan Ryan."

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we seek to}} take notice of the {{evolution}} and continuity of Jan Patočka’s phenomenology {{on the topic of}} the world and human existence’s relationship with it.

Now {{we want to get}} back home, both for {{personal}} reasons <b>and</b> because <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is by work that we can best help Britain.

6000|$|... 143. We {{have been}} so long {{accustomed}} to see the horizontal lines and simple forms which, as we have observed, still prevail among the Ausonian villas, used with the greatest dexterity, and the noblest effect, in the compositions of Claude, Salvator, and Poussin--and so habituated to consider these compositions as perfect models of the beautiful, {{as well as the}} pure in taste--that it is difficult to divest ourselves of prejudice, in the contemplation of the sources from which those masters received their education, their feelings, and their subjects. We would hope, however, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> may be proved, that in this case principle assists and encourages prejudice. First, referring only to the gratification afforded to the eye, which we know to depend upon fixed mathematical principles, though those principles are not always developed, it is to be observed, that country is always most beautiful when it is made up of curves, and that one of the chief characters of Ausonian landscape is the perfection of its curvatures, induced by the gradual undulation of promontories into the plains. In suiting architecture to such a country, that building which least interrupts the curve on which it is placed will be felt to be most delightful to the eye.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the last}} day of March 1887, the {{government}} felt the necessity of introducing a measure based on facts that they had disputed, and on principles that they had repudiated. Leaseholders were admitted, some hundred thousand of them. That is, the more solemn of the forms of agrarian contract were set aside. Other provisions we may pass over. But this was not the bill to which the report of the Commission pointed. The pith of that report was the revision and abatement of judicial rents, and from the new bill this vital point was omitted. It could hardly have been otherwise after a curt declaration made by the prime minister in the previous August. “We do not contemplate any revision of judicial rents,” he said—immediately, by the way, after appointing a commission {{to find out what it}} was that they ought to contemplate. “We do not think it would be honest in the first place, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would be exceedingly inexpedient.”(231) He now repeated that to interfere with judicial rents because prices had fallen, would be to “lay your axe to the root of the fabric of civilised society.”(232) Before the bill was introduced, Mr. Balfour, who had gone to the Irish office on the retirement of Sir M. H. Beach in the month of March, proclaimed in language even more fervid, that it would be folly and madness to break these solemn contracts.(233) ...|$|E
60|$|But, {{discarding}} any inferences {{from such}} uncertain evidence, {{the outline of}} Young’s character is too distinctly traceable in the well-attested facts of his life, and yet more in the self-betrayal that runs through all his works, for us to fear that our general estimate of him may be false. For, while no poet seems less easy and spontaneous than Young, no poet discloses himself more completely. Men’s minds have no hiding-place out of themselves—their affectations do but betray another phase of their nature. And if, in the present view of Young, {{we seem to be}} more intent on laying bare unfavorable facts than on shrouding them in “charitable speeches,” it is not because we have any irreverential pleasure in turning men’s characters “the seamy side without,” but because we see no great advantage in considering a man as he was not. Young’s biographers and critics have usually set out from the position that he was a great religious teacher, and that his poetry is morally sublime; and they have toned down his failings into harmony with their conception of the divine and the poet. For our own part, we set out from precisely the opposite conviction—namely, that the religious and moral spirit of Young’s poetry is low and false, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> of some importance to show that the “Night Thoughts” are the reflex of the mind in which the higher human sympathies were inactive. This judgment is entirely opposed to our youthful predilections and enthusiasm. The sweet garden-breath of early enjoyment lingers about many a page of the “Night Thoughts,” and even of the “Last Day,” giving an extrinsic charm to passages of stilted rhetoric and false sentiment; but the sober and repeated reading of maturer years has convinced us that it would hardly be possible to find a more typical instance than Young’s poetry, of the mistake which substitutes interested obedience for sympathetic emotion, and baptizes egoism as religion.|$|E
