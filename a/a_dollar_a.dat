He later became a painter and car cleaner in the railroad shops. In December 1871, when a drunken locomotive fireman failed to report for work, Debs was pressed into service as a night fireman. He decided to remain a fireman on the run between Terre Haute and Indianapolis, earning more than <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> night for the next three and half years.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Murphy was a loner with {{mood swings}} and an {{explosive}} temper. He {{grew up in}} Texas, around Farmersville, Greenville, and Celeste, where he attended elementary school. His father drifted {{in and out of}} the family's life and eventually deserted them. Murphy dropped out of school in fifth grade and got a job picking cotton for <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> day to help support his family; he also became skilled with a rifle, hunting small game to help feed them. After his mother died of endocarditis and pneumonia in 1941, he worked at a radio repair shop and at a combination general store, garage and gas station in Greenville. Hunt County authorities placed his three youngest siblings in Boles Children's Home, a Christian orphanage in Quinlan. After the war, he bought a house in Farmersville for his oldest sister Corinne and her husband Poland Burns. His other siblings briefly shared the home.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of ethnicity, most cowboys {{came from}} lower social classes and the pay was poor.

25|$|Consumers {{were also}} {{unhappy with the}} system. Manipulated prices often forced them to pay {{unexpectedly}} high prices for staple foods. For example, in 1906 and 1907, the price of food skyrocketed mysteriously. Onion prices climbed from 10 cents a pound in 1906 to <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> pound in 1907 (from US$0.10 to $1.00). By comparison, {{a pair of shoes}} cost $2.00 at the time.|$|E
25|$|The overall {{decline in}} food supplies, {{made worse by}} the {{inadequate}} transportation system, led to serious shortages and high prices in urban areas. When bacon reached <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> pound in 1863, the poor women of Richmond, Atlanta and many other cities began to riot; they broke into shops and warehouses to seize food. The women expressed their anger at ineffective state relief efforts, speculators, and merchants. As wives and widows of soldiers they were hurt by the inadequate welfare system.|$|E

In nearby Boston, Massachusetts, Pratt joined a company specializing in paints and whale oil products. In 1850 or 1851, he came to New York City, where he worked for a similar company handling paint and oil.|$|E

He was offered a contract by the minor league Kansas City Blues for $135 a month, more money than his father was making. Since young Stengel was underage, his father had to agree, which he did. Louis Stengel recalled, [...] "So I put down my paper and signed. You could never change that boy's mind anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|The Haitians at gravest risk {{of victimization}} by human traffickers are its poorest people, {{particularly}} children. In Haiti, the poorest {{country in the}} western hemisphere, over half the population lives on less than <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> day and over three quarters live on less than two dollars a day. [...] Severe poverty, compiled {{with a lack of}} social services such as education and basic healthcare increases a child’s vulnerability to modern slavery. [...] Factors that increase a child's likelihood of becoming a restavek include illness or loss of one or both parents, lack of access to clean water, lack of educational opportunities, and having access to family in a city. [...] In addition to poverty, individual factors that can lead to exploitation include unemployment, illiteracy, poor educational opportunities, a history of physical or sexual abuse, homelessness, and drug abuse. These individual factors “push” people towards pathways of human trafficking and modern day slavery. Oftentimes men, women and children accept slave-like work conditions because there is little hope for better and they need to survive. Some cross national borders in search of positive opportunities, but instead find themselves a part of the exploited work force. [...] Additionally, factors that make people easy targets for traffickers make enslavement more likely. [...] One group at high risk for sexual enslavement and other types of forced labor is internally displaced persons, particularly women and children living in refugee camps, [...] which offer little security. [...] The estimated 10% of undocumented Haitians, whose births go unreported, are at especial risk of enslavement.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the second}} 1992 Presidential Debate, Ross Perot argued: We {{have got to}} stop sending jobs overseas.

2500|$|According to Sarafian, it was Zanuck {{who came}} up with the idea of using the new 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T.

2500|$|Taken into custody, Powell was {{discovered}} {{to have a}} box of pistol cartridges, a compass, hair pomade, a brush and comb, two fine handkerchiefs, {{and a copy of}} his oath of allegiance (signed [...] "L.

Although he claimed he was a poor man who barely earned <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> day for ditch-digging, Powell's wallet contained $25. About 3:00a.m. on April 18, William Bell identified Powell as the man who assaulted Seward. Powell was formally arrested, and imprisoned aboard the monitor USS Saugus, then at anchor in the Anacostia River at the Washington Navy Yard. A second identification was made around mid-morning on April 18 when Augustus Seward visited the Saugus and positively identified Powell as the man who attacked him and his father.|$|E

Two men in the regiment specialized in baking cakes of flour, black sorghum syrup and a little salt, which were sold by sutlers during the regiment's time at Atlanta. These fetched a dollar apiece, or ten for $9.00, or $66.65 per hundred. Purchasers learned not to eat these while marching, as two men who did were later sent to the rear in an ambulance.|$|E

After one long cross-country skiing exercise over the mountains the soldiers went, still on skis, straight to the Jerome where Laurence Elisha, then the owner, let them spend the night and offered them free drinks. Many were struck by the vintage decor. [...] "The only thing missing {{was a bunch of}} trail-worn cowboys or dirt-stained miners bellied up to the bar", one observed.

2500|$|Atlantic rests under [...] {{of water}} near Long Point. That fall, diver John Green {{was hired by}} American Express to dive the wreck and {{retrieve}} Atlantic safe and money known {{to be in a}} cabin, but his attempts failed. In 1855, Green returned with the schooner Yorktown, located the safe, and moved it out to the deck of Atlantic. But Green contracted a near-fatal case of the bends and was taken to a hospital; he was in recovery until the summer of 1856. When he returned to the wreck on 1 July he found the safe and money were gone. Another diver, Eliot Harrington, had found them both and hauled them to the surface. $36,700 was taken from Atlantic safe, at a time when a decent wage was <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> day. American Express went to court for the money; the ending settlement gave Harrington and the four others who worked with him a bit under $2000 each, with American Express taking the rest.|$|E
