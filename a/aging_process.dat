5|$|The redox {{energy from}} NADH and FADH2 is {{transferred}} to oxygen (O2) in several steps via the electron transport chain. These energy-rich molecules are produced within the matrix via the citric acid cycle but are also produced in the cytoplasm by glycolysis. Reducing equivalents from the cytoplasm can be imported via the malate-aspartate shuttle system of antiporter proteins or feed into the electron transport chain using a glycerol phosphate shuttle. Protein complexes in the inner membrane (NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), cytochrome c reductase, and cytochrome c oxidase) perform the transfer and the incremental release of energy is used to pump protons (H+) into the intermembrane space. This process is efficient, but {{a small percentage of}} electrons may prematurely reduce oxygen, forming reactive oxygen species such as superoxide. This can cause oxidative stress in the mitochondria and may contribute to the decline in mitochondrial function associated with the <b>aging</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Federation {{starship}} Enterprise, {{under the}} command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), brings aboard the elderly Admiral Mark Jameson and his wife Anne (Marsha Hunt) on request of Karnas (Michael Pataki), the Governor of Mordan IV. Karnas warns that a dissident terrorist group has taken a Federation Ambassador and his staff hostage, and demand to speak to a negotiator. Jameson had negotiated a previous settlement on Mordan IV. As the ship travels to Mordan IV, they find that Jameson is becoming stronger and more able to move about on his own, and is no longer showing signs of the terminal Iverson's Disease he was known to have before he was beamed aboard. The crew discovers that Jameson has been taking an array of drugs to reverse the <b>aging</b> <b>process</b> over the last two years, and only recently has taken an overdose of the drugs to prepare himself for the negotiations. Jameson begins to appear younger and full of energy, but has frequent pains {{as a result of the}} overdose. By the time they are nearing Mordan, Jameson now appears as a young adult.|$|E

5|$|The final {{enemy is}} Lorenzo, {{who seemed to}} be an ally, but who now menaces Fiona in several {{different}} forms. Fiona first meets him as an old, crippled man. He tells Fiona that Riccardo was always the problem child, and that he created both Riccardo and Ugo in an attempt to find a body with an Azoth which he could use to gain immortality. Ugo had the Azoth, but left the castle to marry Ayla. Now with Riccardo dead, Lorenzo believes that Fiona is his, so he can take the Azoth she inherited from her father. He chases after Fiona, but she is able to crush him in a rock press. However, she soon encounters a resurrected, youthful Lorenzo; the life energy he acquired from Riccardo's body has allowed him mastery over his own <b>aging</b> <b>process.</b> With the help of Hewie, Fiona causes Lorenzo to fall into a pit of lava. At this point, the castle begins to shake and collapse, and Lorenzo returns as a flaming skeleton. He chases Fiona as she heads for the exit, and attempts to block her escape, but as they reach the door, he finally dies, and Fiona and Hewie leave the castle.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of eukaryotic genes are stored {{on a set}} of large, linear chromosomes. The chromosomes are packed within the nucleus in complex with storage proteins called histones to form a unit called a nucleosome. DNA packaged and condensed in this way is called chromatin. The manner in which DNA is stored on the histones, as well as chemical modifications of the histone itself, regulate whether a particular region of DNA is accessible for gene expression. In addition to genes, eukaryotic chromosomes contain sequences involved in ensuring that the DNA is copied without degradation of end regions and sorted into daughter cells during cell division: replication origins, telomeres and the centromere. Replication origins are the sequence regions where DNA replication is initiated to make two copies of the chromosome. Telomeres are long stretches of repetitive sequence that cap the ends of the linear chromosomes and prevent degradation of coding and regulatory regions during DNA replication. The length of the telomeres decreases each time the genome is replicated and has been implicated in the <b>aging</b> <b>process.</b> The centromere is required for binding spindle fibres to separate sister chromatids into daughter cells during cell division.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{reducing}} the age-of-information has been extensively studied in the single-hop networks. In this paper, we minimize the age-of-information in general multihop networks. If the packet transmission times over the network links are exponentially distributed, we prove that a preemptive Last Generated First Served (LGFS) policy results in smaller <b>age</b> <b>processes</b> at all nodes of the network (in a stochastic ordering sense) than any other causal policy. In addition, for arbitrary general distributions of packet transmission times, the non-preemptive LGFS policy is shown to minimize the <b>age</b> <b>processes</b> at all nodes of the network among all non-preemptive work-conserving policies (again in a stochastic ordering sense). It is surprising that such simple policies can achieve optimality of the joint distribution of the <b>age</b> <b>processes</b> at all nodes even under arbitrary network topologies, as well as arbitrary packet generation and arrival times. These optimality results not only hold for the <b>age</b> <b>processes,</b> but also for any non-decreasing functional of the <b>age</b> <b>processes.</b> Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1603. 0618...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Biochar is {{receiving}} increasing attention as a promising functional material in contaminated soil remediation. However, <b>aging</b> <b>processes</b> of biochar can usually take place and affect its remediation function, because surface properties of biochar {{are expected to}} change {{through a variety of}} biotic and abiotic processes. In this review, some important influencing factors of biochar <b>aging</b> <b>processes</b> were discussed, including temperature, and soil-physical, soil-chemical and soil-biological components. It pointed out that biochar <b>aging</b> <b>processes</b> may be promoted by high temperature, protected by soil components, particularly soil organic matter (SOM), and interactions with soil microorganisms. To further prolong application of biochar in nature, biochar aging can be mitigated by its influencing factors...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{minimizing}} the age-of-information {{has been extensively}} studied in single-hop networks. In this paper, we minimize the age of a single information flow in multihop networks. If the packet transmission times over the network links are exponentially distributed, we prove that a preemptive Last-Generated, First-Serve (LGFS) policy results in smaller <b>age</b> <b>processes</b> at all nodes of the network (in a stochastic ordering sense) than any other causal policy. In addition, for arbitrary distributions of packet transmission times, the non-preemptive LGFS policy is shown to minimize the <b>age</b> <b>processes</b> at all nodes among all non-preemptive work-conserving policies (again in a stochastic ordering sense).

These optimality results not only hold for the <b>age</b> <b>processes,</b> but also for any non-decreasing functional of the <b>age</b> <b>processes.</b> Finally, we investigate the class of New-Better-than-Used (NBU) packet transmission time distributions and show that the non-preemptive LGFS policy is within a constant age gap from the optimum average age, and that the gap is independent of system parameters.

The recent demonstration that many of the items available in routine clinical pathology have applicability as biomarkers of the <b>ageing</b> <b>process</b> implies that routine clinical laboratory parameters would be useful as an initial investigation of this possibility. Methods 12, 093 clinical laboratory results 1995 – 2006 were reviewed. To make the age ranges of the medical and addicted groups comparable the age range was restricted to 15 – 45 years. Results 739 drug addicted (DA) and 5834 general medical (GM) age matched blood samples were compared.
