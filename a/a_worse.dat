5|$|The five-year {{survival}} rate for endometrial adenocarcinoma following appropriate treatment is 80%. Most women, over 70%, have FIGO stage I cancer, {{which has the}} best prognosis. Stage III and especially Stage IV cancers has <b>a</b> <b>worse</b> prognosis, but these are relatively rare, occurring in only 13% of cases. The median survival time for stage III-IV endometrial cancer is nine to tenmonths. Older age indicates <b>a</b> <b>worse</b> prognosis. In the United States, white women have a higher {{survival rate}} than black women, who tend to develop more aggressive forms of the disease {{by the time of}} their diagnosis. Tumors with high progesterone receptor expression have a good prognosis compared to tumors with low progesterone receptor expression; 93% of women with high progesterone receptor disease survived to threeyears, compared with 36% of women with low progesterone receptor disease. Heart disease is {{the most common cause of}} death among those who survive endometrial cancer, with other obesity-related health problems also being common.|$|E

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the restoration, the spare A3 boiler had been dispatched in June 2005 to Riley & Son to be completely rebuilt. It was to be used instead of the A4 boiler both out of the desire to restore the locomotive to original condition, {{and because it was}} deemed that the A4 boiler had deteriorated into <b>a</b> <b>worse</b> state than the spare due to the higher operating pressures the locomotive had experienced following the up-rating of the locomotive to 250psi during its last private overhaul. Deemed surplus to requirements, the A4 boiler was sold to Jeremy Hosking for potential use on his locomotive, LNER Class A4 4464 Bittern.|$|E
5|$|Many {{believe that}} person {{might benefit from}} {{prevention}} with antiepileptic drugs. Although this is widely practiced, it is controversial and not based on good evidence. In some studies, use of these medications was associated with <b>a</b> <b>worse</b> prognosis; although {{it is unclear whether}} this might be because the drugs themselves actually cause harm, or because they are used more often in persons with a poorer prognosis. There is a possibility of a gastric hemorrhage due to stress ulcers.|$|E
5|$|Preparatory to the Football League {{resuming}} in 1946–47, the First and Second Division clubs {{from the}} last pre-war season were divided geographically between the Leagues North and South for 1945–46.

Charlton Athletic were second, above Birmingham by 0.002 of a goal. While Charlton could only draw at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers, Birmingham won away at Luton Town, so claimed the title by 0.3 of a goal.|$|E

5|$|There is also modest {{evidence}} that genetic factors influence the prognosis in SAH.

The occurrence of hyperglycemia (high blood sugars) after an episode of SAH confers a higher risk of poor outcome.|$|E

5|$|This {{assessment}} was left unchanged for decades, as few players {{at the highest}} level used the Budapest Gambit and information about games from lesser players could not easily be found. During that time, various responses were developed against the 4.Bf4 line; these included 4...g5, invented by István Abonyi, further developed by the masters Bakonyi and Drimer. The master Kaposztas showed that even when White succeeded in his positional plan, it only meant for Black <b>a</b> <b>worse</b> endgame with drawish tendencies. Two pawn sacrifices were also introduced in the variation with 6.Nbd2 (still in the 4.Bf4 line), based on pawn pushes d7–d6 or f7–f6 and a quick attack against b2.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines, while {{useful in}} the {{management}} of acute alcohol withdrawal, if used long-term can cause <b>a</b> <b>worse</b> outcome in alcoholism. Alcoholics on chronic benzodiazepines have a lower rate of achieving abstinence from alcohol than those not taking benzodiazepines. This class of drugs is commonly prescribed to alcoholics for insomnia or anxiety management. Initiating prescriptions of benzodiazepines or sedative-hypnotics in individuals in recovery has a high rate of relapse with one author reporting {{more than a quarter of}} people relapsed after being prescribed sedative-hypnotics. Those who are long-term users of benzodiazepines should not be withdrawn rapidly, as severe anxiety and panic may develop, which are known risk factors for relapse into alcohol abuse. Taper regimes of 6–12 months have been found to be the most successful, with reduced intensity of withdrawal.|$|E

They lost three of their four games in November, but did manage to defeat Kansas, who were the only Big 12 team to finish with <b>a</b> <b>worse</b> in-conference record than Iowa State. 2012 was the Cyclones' second Liberty Bowl, following the 1972 game in which they lost to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets by a score of 31–30.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to endometrial carcinomas, the uncommon endometrial stromal sarcomas are cancers that {{originate in the}} non-glandular connective tissue of the endometrium. They are generally non-aggressive and, if they recur, can take decades. Metastases to the lungs and pelvic or peritoneal cavities are the most frequent. They typically have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors. The prognosis for low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma is good, with 60–90% five-year survival. High-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma (HGUS) has <b>a</b> <b>worse</b> prognosis, with high rates of recurrence and 25% five-year survival. HGUS prognosis is dictated by {{whether or not the}} cancer has invaded the arteries and veins. Without vascular invasion, the five-year survival is 83%; it drops to 17% when vascular invasion is observed. Stage I ESS has the best prognosis, with five-year survival of 98% and ten-year survival of 89%. ESS makes up 0.2% of uterine cancers.|$|E
