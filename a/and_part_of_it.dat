This alternative route was later named Goodale's Cutoff <b>and</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is {{in the northern part of}} the monument.

It's going to become more and more difficult, and it's going to create more and more disillusioned people who become dishonest and angry and are willing to fuck the next guy to get what they want. There's so much stepping on the backs of other people in our profession. We've been so lucky that we've never had to do that.

Ra'aya Meiheimna is found in Vols. 2 and 3 of the Zohar, but is not found explicitly in Vol. 1.

25|$|The 1794 act {{authorised}} three further branches, to Aylesbury, Buckingham, and Wendover. The 6.5-mile (10.5-kilometre) navigable feeder from Wendover to {{the summit}} level at Tring was opened in 1799, while the 10.5-mile (17 kilometre) Buckingham branch, {{an extension of the}} original proposal for a link to the main road at Old Stratford, was opened in 1801: both eventually fell into disuse, though the Wendover Arm is undergoing active restoration, <b>and</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is again navigable. The Aylesbury arm was envisaged to become a through route to the Thames and thus to the Wilts and Berks Canal and the Kennet and Avon Canal, but the 6-mile (10-kilometre) branch into the town, opened in 1815, was never extended.|$|E
25|$|A {{thermodynamic}} process {{might be}} initiated by a thermodynamic {{operation in the}} surroundings, that mechanically increases in the controlled volume of the vapor. Some mechanical work will be done within the surroundings by the vapor, but also some of the parent liquid will evaporate and enter the vapor collection which is the contiguous surrounding subsystem. Some internal energy will accompany the vapor that leaves the system, {{but it will not}} make sense to try to uniquely identify part of that internal energy as heat <b>and</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as work. Consequently, the energy transfer that accompanies the transfer of matter between the system and its surrounding subsystem cannot be uniquely split into heat and work transfers to or from the open system. The component of total energy transfer that accompanies the transfer of vapor into the surrounding subsystem is customarily called 'latent heat of evaporation', but this use of the word heat is a quirk of customary historical language, not in strict compliance with the thermodynamic definition of transfer of energy as heat. In this example, kinetic energy of bulk flow and potential energy with respect to long-range external forces such as gravity are both considered to be zero. The first law of thermodynamics refers to the change of internal energy of the open system, between its initial and final states of internal equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|St James Park was {{originally}} 'glebe land' belonging to St Paul's church and was {{divorced from the}} main church property by the laying of the Main North Railway line in the early 1870s. It {{is believed to have}} been farmed by James Triggs, the St Paul's Church verger, <b>and</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was developed as a cricket ground by the Papanui Cricket Club under the captaincy of John Matson with the permission of Rev. Lorenzo Moore. By 1874 the new incumbent at St Paul's, the Rev Brittan, had joined the Cricket Club as a player, but had also leased some of the land to Mr Jackson, another club member, for stock grazing. The land appears in an 1880 map as a cricket ground, but was later abandoned by the cricket club and sold to Ivorys Cool Stores in 1916. The land was purchased by the City in 1924 after residents, led by Rev Griffin, petitioned the council for a park and has both main entrances sited on St James Avenue. It was named in a Public Notice drawn up by the Christchurch City Council Bylaws and Finance committee chaired by Councilor Andrews on 30 April 1924. Rev Griffin did not live to see the park opened, and as a mark of respect Memorial Gates and a rose garden we jointly funded by the residents and the Council in his honour.|$|E

500|$|For {{the cover}} of Reckoning, Stipe drew {{a picture of a}} two-headed snake, which he then gave to artist Howard Finster to fill in as a painting. Stipe stated that the imagery was an attempt to define the elements, explaining, [...] "Part of it is rocks <b>and</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is the sun <b>and</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> the sky." [...] The end result was {{considered}} a disappointment, as Stipe had to work with Finster on a long-distance basis, and the reproduction of the artwork for the album sleeve was problematic. The spine of the vinyl version of the album features the phrase [...] "File Under Water". Stipe told NME in 1984 the phrase is the true title of the record. He added [...] "In America, both titles are on the spine, with nothing on the cover. Here [...] they insisted on Reckoning being on the cover." [...] Instead of labeling the sides of the record as [...] "side one" [...] and [...] "side two", the sides were designated as [...] "L" [...] and [...] "R", respectively.|$|E

The troops fought their way out of Yunnan in south-western China, and its soldiers lived in Burma's (now Myanmar) jungles.

In reward, the Thai government granted citizenship to most of the KMT soldiers and their families.|$|E
