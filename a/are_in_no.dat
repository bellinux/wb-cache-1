5|$|Dendritic cells (DC) are phagocytes in tissues {{that are}} {{in contact with the}} {{external}} environment; therefore, they are located mainly in the skin, nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines. They are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites, as both have many spine-like projections, but dendritic cells <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> way connected to the nervous system. Dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems, as they present antigens to T cells, one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system.|$|E
5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed {{because of}} what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E

25|$|The lantern, where present, {{surrounds}} {{both the}} mouth cavity and the pharynx. At {{the top of}} the lantern, the pharynx opens into the esophagus, which runs back down the outside of the lantern, to join the small intestine and a single caecum. The small intestine runs in a full circle around the inside of the test, before joining the large intestine, which completes another circuit in the opposite direction. From the large intestine, a rectum ascends towards the anus. Despite the names, the small and large intestines of sea urchins <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> way homologous to the similarly named structures in vertebrates.|$|E
25|$|The manus and carpus {{are among}} the few areas of the Protoavis {{material}} which are well preserved, and they are astonishingly non-avian. The distal carpals, while long, <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> way similar to those observed in the urvogel or other archaic birds. There is no semilunate element, {{and the structure of}} the radiale and ulnare would have limited the flexibility of the wrist joint. The manus is not tridactyl, and metacarpal V is present. In even the most basal avialian, Archaeopteryx, there is no vestige of the fifth metacarpal and its presence in Protoavis seems incongruous with the claim that it is a bird, let alone one more derived than Archaeopteryx.|$|E
25|$|The local medieval {{rites of}} which we hear, {{such as those of}} Lyons, Paris, Rouen, Salisbury, York, etc., <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> sense {{different}} liturgies. They are all simply the Roman use with slight local variations—variations, moreover, that hardly ever affect the Canon. The Sarum Rite, for instance, which Anglicans have sometimes tried to set up as a sort of rival to the Roman Rite, does not contain in its Canon a single word that differs from the parent-rite as used by the Catholic Church, {{with the exception of a}} commemoration for the king. But some changes were made in medieval times, changes that have since been removed by the conservative tendency of Roman legislation.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} features of the tomb is the presence of carved symbols on the slabs inside the chamber. Lines are formed of rows of individual punched dots, possibly applied with a very early metal tool. One of the more common symbols is a simple line with an attached open semicircle, usually interpreted as a stylised depiction of cattle. Normally, two of these symbols are linked by a further line with emphasised terminals. This may be a simple depiction of a plough. More rarely, two of them are linked by what resembles a yoke and pole, suggesting a cart. Occasionally overlapping signs suggest that the individual carvings <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> meaningful relationship to one another, but represent an accumulation of individual signs. Similar depiction of teams of cattle are known from much more recent (Bronze or Iron Age) carvings at Valcamonica near Capo di Ponte, Northern Italy and at Mont Bégo in the French part of the Ligurian Alps. The symbols are normally assumed to reflect Neolithic ideological or religious ideas.|$|E
500|$|According to Pastafarian beliefs, pirates are [...] "absolute divine beings" [...] and the {{original}} Pastafarians. Furthermore, Pastafarians believe {{that the concept of}} pirates as [...] "thieves and outcasts" [...] is misinformation spread by Christian theologians in the Middle Ages and by Hare Krishnas. Instead, Pastafarians believe that they were [...] "peace-loving explorers and spreaders of good will" [...] who distributed candy to small children, adding that modern pirates <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> way similar to [...] "the fun-loving buccaneers from history". In addition, Pastafarians believe that ghost pirates are responsible for all of the mysteriously lost ships and planes of the Bermuda Triangle. Pastafarians are among those who celebrate International Talk Like a Pirate Day on September 19.|$|E
500|$|Transandinomys bolivaris and T.talamancae are medium-sized, soft-furred rice rats. The upperparts—brownish in T.bolivaris and reddish in T.talamancae—are much {{darker than}} the whitish underparts. Both species are {{characterized}} by very long vibrissae (whiskers), but those of T.bolivaris are particularly long. In addition to whisker length and fur color, several other morphological differences distinguish the two, including the wider first upper molar in T.bolivaris. Species of Hylaeamys and Euryoryzomys also differ from Transandinomys in some details of the skull and teeth and have shorter whiskers. Species of Transandinomys live on the ground, are active during the night, eat both plant and animal matter, and construct nests of vegetation. Both are hosts to various external parasites. They <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> apparent danger of extinction and have been assessed as [...] "Least Concern" [...] in the IUCN Red List.|$|E

[...] Denise Boyd of the BBC wrote: [...] "The introduction [...] 'Senorita' immediately grabs your attention." [...] Tyler Martin of Stylus said that the song's rhythm section was [...] "brilliant, a simple, yet distinctive beat that could only come from the Neptunes. The song allows for much amusement in {{the last minute and}} a half with a sing-along that is more wonderful and surprising than most artists have offered us this year." [...] Jonathan Takiff of the Philadelphia Daily News wrote that the track and [...] "Nothing Else", another song from the album, reshape [...] "Stevie Wonder-style Latin pop". Katie McDonald of Boston College wrote: [...] "The album opens with the Latin and hip-hop influenced 'Senorita'. Although this reviewer was a little amused by Timberlake's use of the word 'Momma' in reference to a girl, this track is nothing to mock. Timberlake's voice complements the dynamic beat; and although the lyrics <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> way profound, at least he wrote them himself." [...] Lisa Verrico of The Times wrote that the song could be 'NSYNC [...] "with a salsa flavour". Christian Dahlager of Iowa State Daily noted that Timberlake [...] "cops classic Michael Jackson" [...] throughout the album, and on the tracks [...] "Señorita" [...] and [...] "Rock Your Body". Howard Cohen of Knight Ridder said that in the album Timberlake [...] "appropriates Jackson's trademark 'Thriller'-era falsetto squeals and staccato vocal style on the tuneless first single 'Like I Love You', 'Senorita' and a couple other cuts." ...|$|E
