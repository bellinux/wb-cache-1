5|$|Although Robert {{condemned}} Gilbert Porrée {{in conjunction}} with Peter Lombard, he did not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Lombard's Christology, or views {{on the nature of}} Jesus Christ. Likewise, although he disagreed with some of Abelard's teachings, he defended Abelard against charges of heresy. Robert did, however, <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> some of Abelard's teachings and methods. The introduction to the Sententiae proclaims Robert's desire to harmonise the writings of two unnamed scholars, who have been identified by modern writers as Hugh of St Victor and Abelard.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Berkeley {{scientists}} {{claimed the}} discovery of element 103 in the reaction of californium with boron and carbon ions. They claimed {{the production of the}} isotope 257103, and also claimed to have synthesized an alpha decaying isotope of element 102 that had a half-life of 15s and alpha decay energy 8.2MeV. They assigned this to 255102 without giving a reason for the assignment. The values do not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> those now known for 255No, although they do <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> those now known for 257No, and while this isotope probably played a part in this experiment its discovery was inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|Most {{orthodox}} Christian theologians <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> {{the first}} three propositions describing God as all-knowing (1), all-powerful (2), and morally perfect (3), and <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the proposition that there is evil in the world, as described in proposition (4). The logical argument from evil asserts that a God with the attributes (1-3), must know about all evil, {{would be capable of}} preventing it, and as morally perfect would be motivated to do so. The argument from evil concludes that the existence of the orthodox Christian God is, therefore, incompatible with the existence of evil and can be logically ruled out.|$|E

5|$|The group {{agrees that}} Randall is an {{imminent}} threat, and Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) believes {{he should be}} executed but waits until sunset. Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) finds most of the group <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Rick's decision, and attempts {{to change their minds}} by appealing to their humanity, civilization and morality. Most <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Rick's choice for various reasons, but Shane (Jon Bernthal) agrees to support Dale should he be able to convince the others to change their minds.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1020s, Maymandi urged Mahmud to invade Jibal, {{which was then}} {{under the control of}} the young Buyid ruler Majd al-Dawla. However, the real ruler of the region was Majd al-Dawla's mother Sayyida Shirin, which was already known by the neighbors of the Buyids, {{including}} the Ghaznavids. Mahmud, however, did not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him, because he did not feel his empire threatened because of a woman ruling in the region.|$|E
5|$|First the {{machines}} {{will do a}} lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern.

5|$|In 2008, {{a recall}} vote was held asking if 2003 inductee Chris Benoit, who {{killed his wife}} and son before {{committing}} suicide in June 2007, should remain in the hall. To have Benoit removed, Meltzer required that 60% of voters must <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the proposal. Although the majority voted for Benoit's removal, they only represented 53.6% of the votes, falling short of the number required. Benoit remains on the list of inductees.|$|E

5|$|It has {{recently}} been determined that the echolocation vocalizations do not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> evolutionary relationship between swiftlet species as suggested by DNA sequence comparison. This suggests that as in bats, echolocation sounds, once present, adapt rapidly and independently to the particular species' acoustic environment.|$|E
5|$|Jains <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Hindus that {{violence}} in self-defence can be justified, and {{they agree that}} a soldier who kills enemies in combat is performing a legitimate duty.

5|$|Jazz {{musician}} Putter Smith {{was invited}} by Harry Saltzman to play Mr. Kidd, after a Thelonious Monk Band show. Musician Paul Williams was originally cast as Mr. Wint. When he couldn't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the producers on compensation, Bruce Glover replaced him. Glover {{said he was}} surprised at being chosen, because at first producers said he was too normal and that they wanted a deformed, Peter Lorre-like actor.|$|E

5|$|Sanchez {{became the}} first USC quarterback to leave school early for the NFL since Todd Marinovich did so after the 1990 season. During the press conference, head coach Pete Carroll {{made it clear that}} he did not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Sanchez's decision, and advised him of the low success-rate of quarterbacks who left college early. Despite the public disagreement, the two {{remained}} close afterward.|$|E
5|$|The possessive determiners (analogous to English my, his, etc.) {{are used}} to {{indicate}} the possessor of the noun they determine. They mark the person and number of the possessor, and are inflected to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the noun they are attached in number and case. While the English language distinguishes between masculine and feminine singular possessors (his vs. her), late Quenya generally does not.|$|E

5|$|Adjectives {{modify a}} noun by {{providing}} {{additional information about}} their referents. In English, adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after determiners. In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected, {{and they do not}} agree in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases the slender boy, and many slender girls, the adjective slender does not change form to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> either the number or gender of the noun.|$|E
5|$|Beonna (also {{known as}} Beorna) was King of East Anglia from 749. He is notable {{for being the}} first East Anglian king whose coinage {{included}} both the ruler's name and his title. The end-date of Beonna's reign is not known, but may have been around 760. It is thought that he shared the kingdom with another ruler called Alberht and possibly with a third man, named Hun. Not all experts <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> these regnal dates, or {{the nature of his}} kingship: {{it has been suggested that}} he may have ruled alone (and free of Mercian domination) from around 758.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, the Court held that, {{due to the}} Eleventh Amendment, {{federal courts}} could not {{exercise}} ancillary jurisdiction over cross-claims by counties against states. Although only two other justices <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> the entirety of Justice Powell's majority opinion, Brennan and Marshall <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> Parts I-IV and VI (the Oneida's claims against the counties) and Burger, White, and Rehnquist <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> Part V (the counties claims against the state), thus forging separate majorities.|$|R
