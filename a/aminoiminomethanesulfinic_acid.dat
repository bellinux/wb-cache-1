5000|$|The {{complementary}} base is the sulfoxylate anion SO22− {{which is}} much more stable. In between these states is the SO2H− ion, also somewhat stable. Sulfoxylate ions can be made by decomposing thiourea dioxide in an alkaline solution. To do this, thiourea dioxide first forms a tautomer, <b>aminoiminomethanesulfinic</b> <b>acid</b> (H2NC(=NH)SO2H, abbreviated AIMS) which breaks apart. Sulfoxylate reacts with formaldehyde to yield a hydroxymethane sulfinate called rongalite: SO2H− [...] + H2CO → HOCH2SO2− which is an importance chemical for dyeing.|$|E
