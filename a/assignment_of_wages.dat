40|$|This paper uses {{evidence}} from late nineteenth-and early twentieth-century personnel records of two Australian banks {{to examine the}} nature of internal labour markets prior to the Second World War. It is argued that the industry possessed all the classic features of internal labour markets: limited ports of entry, internal promotion, long careers, and <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> by well-defined rules. The paper then examines the reasons why banks adopted internal labour markets. Finally, the paper examines the recent decline of internal labour markets and examines the role of technological and social changes in this decline.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to analyse, in a theoretical perspective, {{the effects of}} economic fluctuations on the personal distribution of incomes. The framework developed here is logically separated into two building blocks. The first is a macrodynammic model determining wages and profits, I. e. the functional income distribution. The second {{is a set of}} ''entitlement rules'', regulating the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> and profits to people and, hence, the personal income distribution. This admittedly artificial separation has the advantage of providing an approach that can, in principle, be applied to different models of the trade cycle, and of highlighting the arbitrariness of the choice of the entitlement rules, whose main determinants are social and historical factors. This analytical framework is applied to Goodwin''s growth cycle model. Changes in income distribution are examined by means of two criteria: the Lorenz dominance and the Gini coefficient. The result of this paper show that inequality is unambiguously affected by economic fluctuations only over certain phases of the business cycle, while in the other phases Lorenz curves cross. This can partly explain why empirical evidence on this issue is rather mixed. On the other hand, the loose positive relationship between inequality and unemployment confirms one of the few regularities found in empirical research...|$|E
40|$|The {{doctrine}} of unconscionability, which a court may invoke to invalidate a contract, has a nonsubstantive and a substantive branch. Nonsubstantive unconscionability arises when certain factors, {{such as a}} lack of commercial sophistication, apparently prevent a contracting party from exercising his freedom to choose the terms of an agreement. Substantive unconscionability arises when a contract yields a result that affects a contracting party too harshly or that affects a noncontracting party adversely. Such contracts may include an agreement containing a disclaimer of warranties or an <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wages.</b> These two branches of unconscionability hereinafter are labeled 2 ̆ 2 nonsubstantive 2 ̆ 2 factors or objections and 2 ̆ 2 substantive 2 ̆ 2 factors or objections, respectively. This article explores the nonsubstantive objections to the enforcement of a contract. These objections fall into four categories. The first category, poverty, involves those situations where a poor consumer, although he would prefer not to bear certain risks under a contract, can afford only with great difficulty an agreement that allocates these risks to the seller. The second category, market unresponsiveness, comprises two possible restrictions upon a contracting party 2 ̆ 7 s freedom of choice. First, a buyer accepting a standardized agreement may have to take terms that do not reflect his true preferences because the additional cost of particularizing the contract would exceed the additional benefit that he would derive from an individualized agreement. Second, a seller exercising monopoly power may offer a buyer fewer choices than would exist in a competitive market. The third category of nonsubstantive unconscionability, incompetency, addresses the problem of a buyer who may be too unsophisticated or too inept to make contracts that fully satisfy his preferences. The fourth category, lack of information, involves those situations where a contracting party lacks the information to make his preferences and purchases congruent, either because the information is unavailable or because the cost of finding and absorbing it exceeds, at the margin, the value of the information...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} values comumers place on {{restrictions}} of creditor remedies. The unique data employed {{were derived from}} a 1979 consumer survey taken across four local credit markets that differed significantly in their legal environments. The results of binomial logit analysis identified the characteristics of consumers {{who were willing to}} pay for contractual protection from several creditor remedies. A study of the dollar amounts that consumers were inclined to pay provided few significant results •. One aspect of the legal environment for consumer credit is the restrictions placed on remedies that creditors may use to collect delin-quent and defaulted debts. A major change in this legal setting occurred on March 1, 1985 when, after ten years of rule making, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published its Credit Practice Rule. The regulation prohibits consumer credit contracts from including confessions of judgment, waivers that exempt certain property from creditor's claims, the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> future <b>wages,</b> the non purchase money security interests in household goods. It also bans the pyramiding of late charges. This ruling affects finance companies, retailers, and federal credit unions.

40|$|We {{study the}} role <b>of</b> establishment-specific <b>wage</b> {{premiums}} in generating recent increases in West German wage inequality. Models with additive fixed effects for workers and establishments are fit in four sub-intervals spanning {{the period from}} 1985 to 2009. We show that these models provide a good approximation to the wage structure and can explain {{nearly all of the}} dramatic rise in West German wage inequality. Our estimates suggest that the increasing dispersion <b>of</b> West German <b>wages</b> has arisen from a combination of rising heterogeneity between workers, rising dispersion in the wage premiums at different establishments, and increasing assortativeness in the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> workers to plants. In contrast, the idiosyncratic job-match component <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> variation is small and stable over time. Decomposing changes in mean wages between different education groups, occupations, and industries, we find that increasing plant-level heterogeneity and rising assortativeness in the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> workers to establishments explain a large share of the rise in inequality along all three dimensions...|$|R

30|$|An {{emerging}} literature {{argues that}} changes in the allocation of workplace “tasks” between capital and labor, and between domestic and foreign workers, has altered the structure of labor demand in industrialized countries and fostered employment polarization—that is, rising employment in the highest and lowest paid occupations. Analyzing this phenomenon within the canonical production function framework is challenging, however, because the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> tasks to labor and capital in the canonical model is essentially static. This essay sketches an alternative model <b>of</b> the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> skills to tasks based upon comparative advantage, reviews key conceptual and practical challenges that researchers face in bringing the “task approach” to the data, and cautions against two common pitfalls that pervade the growing task literature. I conclude with a cautiously optimistic forecast for {{the potential of the}} task approach to illuminate the interactions among skill supplies, technological capabilities, and trade and offshoring opportunities, in shaping the aggregate demand for skills, the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> skills to tasks, and the evolution <b>of</b> <b>wages.</b>|$|R

In dairy farms, permanent wage earners have been recruited to carry out milking in particular. Studies show that human resource management practices can help farmers to retain wage earners in farms, but the authors do not take into account changes in wage earners' work over time. Our hypothesis is that dynamic aspects in work content are crucial for wage earners, because they give them some perspective and good reasons to stay. In this paper, we analyze the evolution <b>of</b> permanent <b>wage</b> earners' work in dairy farms according to a human resource management approach. Individual interviews were carried out with farmers and permanent wage earners who work in specialized or diversified dairy farms.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{introduce}} a novel source <b>of</b> residual <b>wage</b> dispersion. In the model, workers are heterogenous in productivity and randomly apply to ex ante identical posted vacancies. Each employer simultaneously meets several applicants, offers {{the position to}} the best candidate and bargains with her about the wage. Since the outside option of the employer is to hire the second-best worker, the wage paid to the best applicant decreases in the productivity of her closest competitor. Because the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> workers to vacancies is random in equilibrium, each worker faces a nondegenerate distribution <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> given her productivity before applying to a job. The framework suggests that the capability of search models to generate residual wage dispersion must be restricted to match-specific shocks. The model also predicts (i) residual <b>wage</b> dispersion <b>of</b> level <b>wages</b> increasing in productivity; (ii) residual <b>wage</b> dispersion <b>of</b> log <b>wages</b> decreasing in productivity; (iii) a negative relation between unemployment and residual wage dispersion and (iv) positive relation between productivity dispersion and residual wage dispersion. To assess these empirical predictions, I calibrate the model to match the mean and variance <b>of</b> the log <b>wages</b> in CPS data 1985 - 2006. The model’s predictions are strongly supported in the data...|$|R

We use a unique micro dataset on monthly frequency, covering wages in the Icelandic private sector for the period from 1998 - 2010, and draw the following conclusions. First, the mean frequency <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> change is 10. 8 % per month. When weighted for heterogeneity across industries and occupations the result is almost identical; the frequency of change is 10. 5 % per month. Second, only 0. 5 % <b>of</b> monthly <b>wage</b> changes are decreases. Third, the mean duration <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> spells is 8. 9 months. Onefifth <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> spells last longer than a year while other spells last for one year or shorter. Fourth, wage setting displays strong features of time-dependence: half <b>of</b> all <b>wage</b> changes are synchronised in January, but other adjustments are staggered through the year. Fifth, there is limited evidence of state-dependence: frequency <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> increases, size <b>of</b> increases, frequency <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> decreases and size of decreases do not correlate with inflation. However, both frequency and size <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> decreases have significant correlation with unemployment.
