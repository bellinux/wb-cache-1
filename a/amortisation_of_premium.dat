The possibility of replacing oil- or gas-generated electricity with wind-generated, autoproduced electricity is examined in this paper. Efficient electrical autoproduction requires understanding of the local load. The electrical load examined here is that of Waterford Institute of Technology. The turbine selection is examined in terms of the characterised load, the displaced CO 2, the <b>amortisation</b> <b>of</b> the invested capital and the local wind resources...|$|R
5000|$|Despite Chelsea's {{intermediate}} holding company, [...] "Chelsea FC plc", {{making a}} sight improvement in its accounts {{with a net}} loss of £67.7 million for the 2010-11 season, the effect of the increase in intangible assets led to a higher cost in the future. As transfer fee was considered as a purchase of a capital, the real effect of transfer fee was the <b>amortisation</b> <b>of</b> the transfer fee, which is proportionally to the contract length. For example, Fernando Torres' £50 million transfer fee had to be amortised by about £9 million a season, which in the 2010-11 season amounted to only £4.5 million (due to half season). The club may lower the expense <b>of</b> <b>amortisation</b> by selling players and extending the player contract.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} replicates with modifications {{the previous}} study by Coombes, Otto and Stokes (1993) which examines the economic determinants <b>of</b> the <b>amortisation</b> <b>of</b> identifiable intangible assets (lIAs). The study {{focuses on the}} published consolidated annual reports of a sample of top 150 listed Australian companies, ranked by market capitalisation, as at June 1989, over the period 1989 to 1990, whereas the previous study by Coombes et al. (1993) concentrates on the top 150 listed Australian companies, ranked by market capitalisation, as at 30 June, 1988, over the period 1986 to 1989. The empirical evidence of the present research using contracting theory suggests that management 2 ̆ 7 s choice of amortising lIAs depends on whether the investment of these assets has a valuable growth option to generate cash flows into the companies. The evidence {{does not support the}} practice of lIAs 2 ̆ 7 amortisation in order to reduce covenant limitations under existing debt contracts and future debt raisings, and to cause minimisation of political vulnerability. Support for the profit-based managerial compensation incentives to amortise liAs appears only in 1989, possibly due to the pending ED 49 2 ̆ 2 Accounting for Identifiable Intangible Assets 2 ̆ 2 issued by the Australian Accounting Research Foundation which required systematic <b>amortisation</b> <b>of</b> IIAs.

40|$|In this paper, it {{is shown}} {{that with a}} certain {{definition}} of risk-based discounted loss reserves and a certain method of surplus allocation, there is an amount <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> for a contract which has the following properties: (1.) It is the amount <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> required for the contract to neither help nor hurt the insurer's risk-return relation. (2.) It produces an {{internal rate of return}} equal to the insurer's target return. If the insurer gets more than this amount <b>of</b> <b>premium,</b> then the insurer can get more return with the same risk by increasing the percentage <b>of</b> the <b>premium</b> for the overall book which is in the segment. Conversely, if the insurer gets less than this amount <b>of</b> <b>premium,</b> the insurer can increase its return by decreasing the percentage <b>of</b> the overall <b>premium</b> which is in the segment. The amount <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> is equal to the risk-based premium in "Pricing to Optimize an Insurer's Risk-Return Relation, " (PCAS 1996). The above property 1 <b>of</b> risk-based <b>premium</b> is proven by Theorem 2 of the 1996 PCA...|$|R
50|$|According to {{a report}} {{published}} by the CBO in 2008, administrative costs for private insurance represent approximately 12% <b>of</b> <b>premiums.</b> Variations in administrative costs between private plans are largely attributable to economies of scale. Coverage for large employers has the lowest administrative costs. The percentage <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> attributable to administration increases for smaller firms, and is highest for individually purchased coverage. A 2009 study published by BCBSA found that the average administrative expense cost for all commercial health insurance products was represented 9.2% <b>of</b> <b>premiums</b> in 2008. Administrative costs were 11.1% <b>of</b> <b>premiums</b> for small group products and 16.4% in the individual market.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to present the {{redistribution}} importance <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> and service in the health insurance. In the paper, the particular relationship between the health insurance and the public finance was shown. The redistribution importance <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> and service in the obligatory public health insurance and in the voluntary private health insurance was discussed separately. The structure and importance <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> in the obligatory public health insurance was presented in the connection with the structure and importance of personal income lax. The structure and importance of service in the obligatory public health insurance was shown in the connection with methods of health care rationing (ensured services). The redistribution importance <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> and service in the voluntary private health insurance was presented as the consequence of inefficiency of obligatory public health insurance.
