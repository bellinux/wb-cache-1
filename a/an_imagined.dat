5|$|Although {{influenced}} by Matisse, the Oriental art that Jolin discovered at Musée Guimet {{was even more}} important to his style. Chinese and Japanese art became the base for the decorative, slightly naïve style in light colours, that he developed during the 1910s and 1920s. Jolin's style deviates {{from that of the}} traditional Expressionists, in that he simplifies his motifs in an almost primitive way, painting <b>an</b> <b>imagined</b> reality rather than raw emotions.|$|E

5|$|As cheap {{reproductions of}} Hope, and from 1908 {{high-quality}} prints, began to circulate in large quantities, {{it became a}} widely popular image. President Theodore Roosevelt displayed a copy at his Sagamore Hill home in New York; reproductions circulated worldwide; and a 1922 film depicted Watts's creation of the painting and <b>an</b> <b>imagined</b> story behind it. By this time Hope was coming to seem outdated and sentimental, and Watts was rapidly falling out of fashion. In 1938 the Tate Gallery ceased to keep their collection of Watts's works on permanent display.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} argued {{variously}} that the Eskaya are a remnant of the original indigenous settlers on Bohol; that they migrated to Bohol from Sumatra {{in the seventh century}} A.D.; that they are descendants of the resistance groups that fought under Francisco Dagohoy; that they are a cult or secret society; or that they are a conscious reconstruction of <b>an</b> <b>imagined</b> pre-colonial society.|$|E
5|$|When the {{division}} was {{not engaged in}} coastal-defence duties or unit training, formation-level training {{took the form of}} increasingly larger exercises. Exercise Waterloo, conducted from 14–16June 1941, was the largest in the United Kingdom to date, with ICanadian Corps counter-attacking <b>an</b> <b>imagined</b> German sea and air landing. Exercise Bumper, held from 29September to 3October, was larger still, involving 250,000 men. These exercises tended to concentrate on traffic control, communications, and logistical concerns, and were of little practical value to the infantry.|$|E

Creates anything it desires--{{and in a moment}}. Creates without material.

I think the whole thing, and in a moment it is before you--created.|$|R
5|$|Imaginative space {{also serves}} an {{important}} function within the poem. Part one contains a rose garden that allegorically represents potential within human existence. Although the garden does not exist, it {{is described in}} realistic manner and is portrayed as <b>an</b> <b>imagined</b> reality. Also, the narrator's statement that words exist in the mind allows this imagined reality to be shared between the narrator and the reader. This is then destroyed by the narrator claiming that such a place has no purpose. The garden image has other uses within the poem beyond creating a shared imaginative space; it serves to invoke memories within the poem, and it functions {{in a similar manner}} in other works by Eliot, including The Family Reunion.|$|E

25|$|Like Mao and Tallien, Tuten's next novel, Van Gogh's Bad Café (1997), offers <b>an</b> <b>imagined</b> {{glimpse into}} the psyche of a {{historical}} character, Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh. The book is also similar to Mao in that {{the time and place}} of action and the narrator are inconsistent throughout and change without warning. Van Gogh's Bad Café explores the themes of love and addiction.|$|E
25|$|The affair {{inspired}} Sir Herbert Croft's epistolary novel Love and Madness (1780), <b>an</b> <b>imagined</b> {{correspondence between}} Hackman and Martha Ray.

25|$|Of all {{the books}} Asturias had read, the book La tierra del faisán y del venado (The Land of the Pheasant and the Deer) by Antonio Mediz Bolio is {{considered}} to be the most direct antecedent of Leyendas de Guatemala.

25|$|Imaginary Realism {{is a term}} first {{coined by}} Dutch painter Carel Willink as a pendant of magic realism. Where magic realism uses fantastical and unreal elements, {{imaginary}} realism strictly uses realistic elements in <b>an</b> <b>imagined</b> scene. As such, the classic painters with their biblical and mythological scenes, can be qualified as 'imaginary realists'. With the increasing availability of photo editing software, also art photographers like Karl Hammer and others create artistic works in this genre.|$|E
25|$|Cecilia and Robbie {{were never}} reunited: Robbie died of {{septicaemia}} at Dunkirk {{on the morning}} of the day he was to be evacuated, and Cecilia drowned months later in the Balham tube station bombing during the Battle of Britain. Briony hopes to give the two, in fiction, the happiness that she robbed them of in real life. The last scene shows <b>an</b> <b>imagined,</b> happily reunited Cecilia and Robbie living on in a house by the sea.|$|E
25|$|The 18th {{century was}} also a great age for the {{topographical}} print, depicting more or less accurately a real view {{in a way that}} landscape painting rarely did. Initially these were mostly centred on a building, but {{over the course of the}} century, with the growth of the Romantic movement pure landscapes became more common. The topographical print, often intended to be framed and hung on a wall, remained a very popular medium into the 20th century, but was often classed as a lower form of art than <b>an</b> <b>imagined</b> landscape.|$|E
