The red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus, and Yabbie, Cherax destructor, are classified as invasive alien species by Spanish legislation. The most significant negative impacts of these species in freshwater ecosystems are noted, and some management methods are proposed. In addition, scientific studies addressing the origin and taxonomy of the Iberian white-clawed crayfish, Austropotamobius italicus italicus, are discussed. The Iberian populations of A. i. italicus have been severely diminished since {{the onset of the}} expansion of the <b>aphanomycosis</b> disease in 1978. However, this trend began to undergo reversal a few years ago, and the populations of this species are now growing. Finally, current legislation concerning the fishing and conservation of crayfish species is explained and discussed...|$|E

40|$|This is the <b>Aphanomycosis</b> of {{crayfish}}: {{crayfish plague}} report {{produced by the}} Environment Agency in 2000. Crayfish plague is an extremely virulent fungal disease of European crayfish species, the white clawed or stone crayfish of Western Europe Austropotamobius pallipes, the Noble crayfish of northern Europe Astacus astacus and the narrow clawed crayfish of Eastern Europe, Astacus leptodactylus. The white claw crayfish A. pallipes is the indigenous native crayfish of the British Isles. Until the early 1980 s there were extensive healthy populations of this crayfish in almost all suitable alkaline river and lake environments in England and Wales {{as far north as}} Northumberland. The conservation importance of this native crayfish is widely recognised. This report provides a general review of the literature of crayfish plague, including an overview of its spread through the British Isles from CEFAS records. Information on current diagnostic methods from the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) Aquatic Disease Manual is provided. Information on the taxonomy, morphology and physiology of the pathogen is reviewed, together with the pathogenicity and pathology of the disease and current means of prevention and control...|$|E
40|$|After {{the first}} spread of {{crayfish}} plague (<b>aphanomycosis)</b> {{at the end}} of the nineteenth century, the formerly abundant populations of native crayfish in Poland declined drastically. Analysis of historical data on the occurrence and distribution of crayfish in Poland led to the conclusion that without human intervention the native crayfish species would be at high risk of being made extinct. The largest programme concerning crayfish monitoring and restocking in Poland was “Active protection of native crayfish in Poland” conducted by the Inland Fisheries Institute, the Department of Ecology, University of Szczecin, the Department of Zoology, Warsaw Agricultural University and the University of Warmia and Mazury that was funded by the EkoFundusz Foundation and Inland Fisheries Institute in 1999 - 2001. One of the main objectives and results of this programme was the determination of indigenous crayfish distribution in Poland (mainly Astacus astacus and Astacus leptodactylus) and the restocking of suitable habitats with indigenous crayfish. The densest populations (> 2 500 adult individuals per hectare) were used as a source of restocking material. Restocking was performed in 54 water bodies using a total of 45 200 individuals of A. astacus and 9 800 of A. leptodactylus. Between 2001 - 2002, the success of the restocking programme was monitored. According to the results obtained so far, the restocking exercise has been successful in at least 60. 8 % of the cases...|$|E
40|$|Sporadic mortalities of redclaw {{crayfish}} Cherax quadricarinatus {{were registered}} in a Sicilian Crayfish facility in October 2011. Red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii reared {{in a separate}} tanks at the same facility did not experience any losses. Twelve moribund specimens of C. quadricarinatus with evident signs of infections {{were sent to the}} CISS of the Messina, for diagnostics investigations. At necropsy diseased crayfish showed loss of appendices with brownish pigmentation of stumps and melanised ulcers on exoskeleton. After gross examination, fresh tissue samples from eight crayfish were obtained for microscopic evaluation and histology. Four specimens were sent to the IZS delle Venezie for histological and bio-molecular analyses. The observation of fresh samples showed hyphae with several round zoosporangia. In histological sections serpiginous lesions were evident in the cuticle and aseptate hyphae in the hypodermis were associated with hemocytic infiltration and melanin deposition. PCR and sequencing analyses confirmed the suspicion of crayfish plague, identifying the oomycetes as Aphanomyces astaci. According to the literature this is the first report of <b>aphanomycosis</b> in farmed redclaw. The role of P. clarkii as asymptomatic carrier of the disease must be seriously taken into account. After the epidemic plague incidence, the farm owner decided to wipe out all crayfish present in the facility, carefully disinfecting the tanks, before restarting the production of P. clarkii...|$|E
