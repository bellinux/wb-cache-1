5|$|RAF night fighter defences {{were still}} in their infancy. Most fighters lacked radar and in any case, radar was {{short-range}} and unreliable. Instead, they flew outside the anti-aircraft guns' fields of fire on likely <b>approach</b> <b>routes</b> using the pilots' vision to locate enemy aircraft. In later years, the night fighter defences would be highly sophisticated. But in 1940, they were not effective. Just 28 sorties were flown against the nocturnal raids.|$|E

5|$|Two years later, a new {{railroad}} {{bridge was}} constructed, replacing the old Long Bridge. In 1906, a highway bridge was constructed nearby. Together, these two projects destroyed what little remained of Fort Runyon. The <b>approach</b> <b>routes</b> to the bridges ran directly through the earthworks {{of the old}} fort, and these were leveled {{in order to provide}} smooth passage for trains and automobiles. By 1941, when ground was broken for work on the Pentagon, nothing remained of the fort. Today, Interstate 395 runs through the site of the fort, and Exit 9 from the interstate is at the approximate center of where Fort Runyon stood. A nearby historical marker erected by the Arlington Historical Society commemorates the fort's existence.|$|E

25|$|June 4–11 : The Second Corps left Hamilton's Crossing on 4 June {{and marched}} to Culpeper, Virginia, {{arriving}} 7 June.

Ewell resumed the march on 10 June, and on 11 June Early and Johnson's Divisions marched via the Sperryville turnpike to Gaines crossroads, while Rodes' Division took the Richmond road toward Flint Hill.

25|$|As {{is common}} at {{domestic}} matches in England, opposing supporters were segregated. Nottingham Forest supporters were allocated the South Stands and Spion Kop {{on the east}} end, with a combined capacity of 29,800, reached by 60 turnstiles spaced along {{two sides of the}} ground. Liverpool supporters were allocated the North and West ends (Leppings Lane), holding 24,256 fans, reached by 23 turnstiles from a narrow concourse. Turnstiles numbered 1 to 10, 10 in all, provided access to 9,700 seats in the North Stand; a further 6 turnstiles (numbered 11 to 16) provided access to 4,456 seats in the upper tier of the West Stand. Finally, 7 turnstiles (lettered A to G) provided access to 10,100 standing places in the lower tier of the West Stand. Although Liverpool had more supporters, Nottingham Forest was allocated the larger area, to avoid the <b>approach</b> <b>routes</b> of rival fans crossing. As a result of the stadium layout and segregation policy, turnstiles that would normally have been used to enter the North Stand from the east were off-limits and all Liverpool supporters had to converge on a single entrance at Leppings Lane. On match day, radio and television advised fans without tickets not to attend. Rather than establishing crowd safety as the priority, clubs, local authorities and the police viewed their roles and responsibilities through the 'lens of hooliganism'.|$|E

40|$|Morphology of the <b>approach</b> <b>route</b> {{through the}} facial recess for {{cochlear}} implant surgery is classified into five types {{based on the}} topographical relationships between the facial nerve, chorda tympani nerve, round window niche and the posterior meatal wall. These five types and/or an absolute value of {{the width of the}} <b>approach</b> <b>route</b> are closely related to the difficulty in surgery. Some radiological parameters seem to be useful for presurgical estimation of this difficulty. The partial removal of the posterior meatal wall, rather than to sacrifice the chorda tympani nerve, is strongly recommended for providing wider <b>approach</b> <b>route</b> in difficult cases.

The fire of the three corps continued at night on villages and woods further back and <b>approach</b> <b>routes</b> from them to the front line, especially Waterlot Farm, Flers, High Wood, Martinpuich, Le Sars and Bapaume. A shortage of heavy artillery ammunition and transport difficulties over wet and cut up ground, led to a ration of [...] and [...] shells per day, for two days. The field artillery was moved forward to {{the south side of}} Montauban Ridge and [...] was dumped per field gun.

Where telephone lines had been cut, IR 180 used rockets and flags to signal to the artillery, which commenced barrage fire on no man's land and the British lines. Sectors P7 to P5 were approached by the 23rd Brigade, whose attack broke down and when a few men came close to the German front line, the defenders fired at maximum intensity.
