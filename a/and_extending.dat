5|$|Flexing {{the toes}} and feet <b>and</b> <b>extending</b> on tiptoes, {{can all be}} very useful in {{detecting}} perforator vein incompetence. These movements unleash a muscle contraction which compresses deep veins. If a perforator valve is incompetent then a reflux from the deep to the superficial through the perforator vein will be registered.|$|E
5|$|In September 2010, York {{announced}} that it had reached a compromise to construct a discontinuous route, with Donald Cousens Parkway ending at the current Steeles Avenue / Ninth Line intersection, widening the two-laned Steeles to six west of that point, <b>and</b> <b>extending</b> Morningside north to Steeles immediately east of Eastvale Drive.|$|E

5|$|A plan {{to widen}} the Narrows Bridge was {{announced}} on 13 April 1998 by the Court Liberal State Government. The $70 million plan would involve the addition of four extra traffic lanes, and {{was part of a}} $230 million package upgrading <b>and</b> <b>extending</b> {{the southern end of the}} Kwinana Freeway. Alannah McTiernan, then the Opposition Transport spokesperson, attacked the plan, saying that the government should instead build a railway to Rockingham.|$|E

In this treatise, he published the first description of the hexagonal symmetry of snowflakes <b>and,</b> <b>extending</b> the discussion into a hypothetical atomistic physical basis for the symmetry, posed what later {{became known as the}} Kepler conjecture, a statement about the most efficient arrangement for packing spheres.|$|E
5|$|At about 75 Jupiter radii {{from the}} planet, the {{interaction}} of the magnetosphere with the solar wind generates a bow shock. Surrounding Jupiter's magnetosphere is a magnetopause, located at the inner edge of a magnetosheath—a region between it and the bow shock. The solar wind interacts with these regions, elongating the magnetosphere on Jupiter's lee side <b>and</b> <b>extending</b> it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit of Saturn. The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere, which protects them from the solar wind.|$|E

5|$|For {{nearly a}} decade, no new {{construction}} took place.

5|$|One final attempt, {{organised}} by Babić, {{was made}} to revive the Z-4 Plan on 16 August.

5|$|The Earls of Morton {{continued}} to live at Aberdour, although they never regained their earlier high status.
