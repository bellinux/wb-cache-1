5|$|<b>Alder</b> {{left for}} Paul's house, with Moore, in November 1805. He and Moore arrived in Virginia the Sunday after New Year, and <b>Alder</b> was {{reunited with his}} {{biological}} mother and siblings. <b>Alder</b> stayed {{with his family in}} Virginia for over a year, and while visiting his family he met {{and fell in love with}} Mary Ann Blont, a woman from Virginia. The couple were married on January 6, 1806, and in August 1806, <b>Alder,</b> Blont, and the rest of Alder's family returned to Pleasant Valley. <b>Alder</b> built another log cabin along the Big Darby Creek in 1806, and he and Mary had 12 children between 1808 and 1830.|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} years that <b>Alder</b> lived with the Indians he was very ill, a {{condition}} <b>Alder</b> attributed to the Indians' diet. The {{other children in the}} village were friendly towards <b>Alder,</b> and worked together to teach him their language, customs, and traditions. In time, <b>Alder</b> fully adopted the Mingo way of life; he lived, hunted, and fought as an Indian. When he was old enough he was given an English musket, which he used to hunt mud turtles, wild turkeys, and raccoons. He was praised in the village for his hunting skills. He grew attached to his new life and when, in 1783, a trader from Kentucky offered to exchange him for a Shawnee prisoner, <b>Alder</b> refused. <b>Alder</b> was living in the Indian village of Mack-a-chack when it was destroyed by Benjamin Logan during his raid into Ohio Country in 1786, and he accompanied the Indians on raids into Kentucky to steal horses from white settlers.|$|E
5|$|After {{some time}} <b>Alder</b> {{developed}} {{interest in his}} original family in Virginia. A companion, John Moore, learned that <b>Alder</b> had been taken prisoner near Greenbrier, and traveled to Wythe County to search for Alder's family. Initial inquiries were unsuccessful, but {{one of a series}} of advertisements Moore placed in the district was seen by Alder's surviving brother Paul. Paul then wrote Jonathan to inform him that the family was still alive.|$|E

5|$|In 1790, Whinecheoh {{died at the}} age of eighty, and Succohanes died in 1792 at the age of ninety. After their deaths, <b>Alder</b> wandered from {{village to}} village, and began courting an Indian woman from Upper Sandusky named Barshaw. In the fall of 1793, during the peak of the Northwest Indian War, he joined Shawnee chief Blue Jacket to defend against Anthony Wayne's attacks in the Ohio Country, and also took part in the attack on Fort Recovery on June 30, 1794. <b>Alder</b> was asked for advice on the 1795 Treaty of Greenville on land reservations, and urged by the Indians to attend its signing. <b>Alder,</b> not realizing the treaty's importance, chose not to attend.|$|E

40|$|Selection {{of cells}} {{positive}} for aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity from a green fluorescent background is difficult with existing reagents. Here we report a red-shifted fluorescent substrate for ALDH, <b>AldeRed</b> 588 -A, for labeling viable ALDHpos cells. We demonstrate that <b>AldeRed</b> 588 -A successfully isolates ALDHhi human hematopoietic {{stem cells from}} heterogeneous cord blood mononuclear cells. <b>AldeRed</b> 588 -A {{can be used for}} multi-color applications to fractionate ALDHpos cells in the presence of green fluorophores including the ALDEFLUOR ™ reagent and cells expressing eGFP. <b>AldeRed</b> 588 -A stains ALDHpos murine pancreatic centroacinar and terminal duct cells, as visualized by fluorescent microscopy. <b>AldeRed</b> 588 -A provides a useful tool to select stem cells or study ALDH within a green fluorescent background...|$|R

5|$|The Loop Parkway {{begins at}} an {{at-grade}} intersection with Lido Boulevard {{on the eastern}} end of Long Beach Barrier Island in the neighborhood of Point Lookout. It proceeds north as a four-lane divided highway, crossing over Reynolds Channel to reach <b>Alder</b> Island, one of several islands comprising Jones Beach State Park. Here, the road slowly bends eastward as it runs across the marshy island. Two U-turn ramps are built into the median near the western end of the island, serving as the only intersections or interchanges of any kind on <b>Alder</b> Island. The Loop Parkway heads east from <b>Alder</b> Island, traversing Long Creek on a drawbridge leading to Meadow Island. The road quickly continues northeast across the island with no connections via interchanges or intersections.|$|E

5|$|When {{the group}} reached the village, <b>Alder</b> learned why {{his life had}} been spared. One of the Mingo chiefs, Succohanos, and his wife, Whinecheoh, were an aging couple who had lost their son, and planned to adopt <b>Alder</b> as a replacement. <b>Alder</b> was forced to run the gauntlet, as a rite of passage, and after he {{exhibited}} bravery during the trial, he was adopted and cared for by Whinecheoh. The Indian's other prisoner, Mrs. Martin, had been promised {{to a man in}} another village, and was taken away during Alder's adoption ceremony.|$|E

5|$|MT 34 was reconstructed—and in {{many places}} relocated—and paved {{starting}} from the Twin Bridges end. The highway was reconstructed from that town to Sheridan in 1939. The reconstructed highway was removed from Middle Road and Tuke Lane to its present course between the two towns. MT 34 was reconstructed from Sheridan to Laurin in 1940. The reconstructed highway bypassed Bivens Creek Road {{and for the first}} time served Laurin directly. Two years later, MT 34 was placed on its modern alignment south through <b>Alder</b> and east through the dredge tailings. The new highway replaced Ruby Road, which bypasses <b>Alder,</b> and another road that bypassed the tailings by following the edge of the valley closer to <b>Alder</b> Creek. MT 34 was reconstructed on or very close to the old road through <b>Alder</b> Gulch to the east end of Virginia City in 1945. Improvements from the Ennis end of the highway began in 1948 when the highway from Ennis west to Old Virginia City Highway in the valley was graveled. Two years later, that stretch was reconstructed and paved. In 1951, MT 34 was placed on its present course west to the highway's summit, which bypassed Old Virginia City Highway. Finally, the modern highway from Twin Bridges to Ennis was completed when the route from Virginia City to the summit was reconstructed and paved in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Sagebrush {{typically}} dominates drier, non-forested {{areas at}} lower elevations. Species that commonly occur with sagebrush include Sandberg bluegrass, wild onion, milk vetches, bluebunch wheatgrass, bitterbrush, gray horsebrush, green rabbitbrush, and others. In riparian areas below , trees such as black cottonwood, narrowleaf cottonwood, thinleaf <b>alder,</b> water birch, and mountain maple grow with shrubs including chokeberry and willows. Riparian areas in largely treeless habitats such as sagebrush steppe primarily consist of willows along with thinleaf <b>alder,</b> chokecherry, mountain maple, shrubby cinquefoil, fireweed, saxifrage, and grasses.|$|E
5|$|The {{corridor}} {{through which}} MT 287 passes {{was part of}} two migration routes along which settlers rushed to attempt to make their fortunes during the <b>Alder</b> Gulch gold rush that started in 1863. Virginia City {{was the target of}} both routes; the new town became the second capital of the Montana Territory in 1865. Settlers from the east followed the Bozeman Trail through Wyoming and eastern Montana, including the namesake city, and settlers from the south used the Virginia City branch of the Montana Trail from Utah and Idaho. After 10 years, the initial gold boom had ended, and the territorial capital moved to Helena in 1875. A second period of gold extraction came {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, when mechanical gold dredges arrived to tear up <b>Alder</b> Gulch to gather more gold. Gold dredge placer mining and some lode mining formed the basis of the area's economy until the gold ore was mostly exhausted; the dredge tailings along <b>Alder</b> Gulch remain a visible reminder of the area's mining past.|$|E
