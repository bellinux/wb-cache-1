AI <b>and</b> <b>UL</b> defined {{the same as in}} United States. For people ages 18 and older the PRI calculations are complex, as the EFSA has set higher and higher values as the phytate content of the diet increases. For women, PRIs increase from 7.5 to 12.7 mg/day as phytate intake increases from 300 to 1200 mg/day; for men the range is 9.4 to 16.3 mg/day. These PRIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs. The EFSA reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 25mg/day, which is much lower than the U.S. value.|$|E

40|$|Uterine {{smooth muscle}} tumors (SMTs) are common pelvic tumors in women, {{and most of}} them are {{diagnosed}} as usual leiomyoma (UL). Exclusion of malignant disease is important in the management of SMTs. However, differentiation of SMTs remains difficult. In this study, we aimed to improve the preoperative diagnosis of SMTs. We examined 21 ULs, 7 atypical leiomyomas (ALs), and 6 leiomyosarcomas (LMSs), all of which were diagnosed by uterine tumor biopsy. Immunohistochemical findings (low-molecular-mass polypeptide 2 (LMP 2) and Ki- 67) and clinical features (serum lactate dehydrogenase level and menopause) were evaluated. Statistically significant differences in the expression of LMP 2 and Ki- 67 were observed between <b>UL</b> <b>and</b> AL <b>and</b> between <b>UL</b> <b>and</b> LMS. The combined LMP 2 and Ki- 67 score was significantly different between <b>UL</b> <b>and</b> AL, between <b>UL</b> <b>and</b> LMS, and between AL and LMS. The combined immunohistochemistry and clinical findings score (total score) was also significantly different between pathological types. The findings of this study suggest that the accuracy of the preoperative diagnosis of SMTs may be improved by using a combination of immunohistochemical and clinical findings...|$|R

25|$|The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{refers to}} the {{collective}} set of information as Dietary Reference Values (DRV), with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI <b>and</b> <b>UL</b> defined {{the same as in}} United States. For women (including those pregnant or lactating), men and children the PRI is 1.6 mg niacin per megajoule (MJ) of energy consumed. As the conversion is 1 MJ = 238.8 kcal, an adult consuming 2388 calories should be consuming 16 mg niacin. This is comparable to U.S. RDAs. The niacin UL is set at 10mg/day, which is much less than the U.S. value. The UL applies to niacin as a supplement consumed as one dose, and in intended to avoid the skin flush reaction. This explains why the PRI can be higher than the UL.|$|E
