25|$|The {{bells of}} St Mary's Cathedral {{have a unique}} place in Australian history. There have been three {{separate}} rings of bells at the cathedral, all cast by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry of London. The first, of eight bells, arrived in Sydney in August 1843, and were installed in a wooden campanile located away from the main building (approximately where the pulpit is today). They were the first bells hung for change ringing in Australia <b>and</b> <b>rang</b> {{for the first time}} on New Year's Day 1844.|$|E

25|$|At about 10:30p.m., Powell {{was escorted}} to the Seward {{residence}} on Lafayette Square near the White House by David Herold. Seward {{had been injured}} in a carriage accident on April 5, and suffered a concussion, broken jaw, broken right arm, and many serious bruises. Local newspapers reported that Seward was at home convalescing, so Powell and Herold knew where to find him. Powell was armed with a Whitney revolver and large knife, and wore black pants, a long overcoat, a grey vest, a grey dress coat, and a hat with a wide brim. Herold waited outside, holding Powell's horse. Powell knocked <b>and</b> <b>rang</b> the bell, and the door was answered by William Bell, Seward's African American butler. Holding up a small bottle, Powell claimed that Seward's physician, Dr. T.S. Verdi, had sent some medicine to the house. Bell was suspicious, as Dr. Verdi had departed the home only an hour earlier and left instructions for Seward not to be disturbed. Bell asked Powell to wait, but Powell pushed past him and began mounting {{the stairs to the}} second-floor bedrooms.|$|E

After a four-year absence from the screen, Khan continued to portray leading roles, most notably in the 2006 box-office hits Fanaa <b>and</b> <b>Rang</b> De Basanti. The following year, he made his directorial debut with Taare Zameen Par, a major success that garnered him the Filmfare Awards for Best Film and Best Director. Khan's greatest commercial successes came with the thriller Ghajini (2008), the comedy-drama 3 Idiots (2009), the action film Dhoom 3 (2013), the satire PK (2014), and the sports biopic Dangal (2016), all of which held records for being the highest-grossing Indian film of all time. Khan won his third Filmfare Best Actor Award for Dangal, which also earned him the highest remuneration fee for a non-Hollywood actor. In addition to being highly popular in India, he is also highly popular overseas, particularly in China, the second largest movie market, as well as Turkey, Hong Kong, and Singapore, among many other countries.|$|E

In Hampankatta, over 4,000 Christians united to defend the Milagres Church and protest. Violence broke out at the Adoration monastery as police began caning the protestors with sticks and bursting teargas shells to disperse them, while they pelted stones at police vans and police. The police were reported to have caused further damage to the Adoration monastery by throwing back stones and glass bottles to restrain the protestors. Union Minister of Labour and Employment Oscar Fernandes and MLA B. Ramanath Rai arrived at the Hampankatta scene at 6 pm. In Karkala, the Catholics of Karkala deanery staged a protest on 15 September condemning the attacks and the desecration of the crucifix and sacrament at Adoration Monastery in particular and organised a 3 kilometre silent protest march from the bus stand to the taluk headquarters and submitted a memorandum to tehsildar Laxman Singh.|$|E

500|$|Maier {{says that}} his letters to London greatly {{influenced}} officials there, but they [...] "distorted" [...] reality. [...] "His misguided conviction that the 'faction' had espoused violence as its primary method of opposition, for example, kept him from recognizing the radicals' peace-keeping efforts....Equally dangerous, Bernard's elaborate accounts were sometimes built on insubstantial evidence." [...] Warden argues that Bernard {{was careful not to}} explicitly ask London for troops, but his exaggerated accounts strongly suggested they were needed. In the fall of 1767 he warned about a possible insurrection in Boston any day, and his exaggerated report of one disturbance in 1768, [...] "certainly had given Lord Hillsboro the impression that troops were the only way to enforce obedience in the town." [...] Warden notes that other key British officials in Boston wrote London with the [...] "same strain of hysteria." [...] Four thousand British Army troops arrived in Boston in October 1768, further heightening tensions. [...] Bernard was vilified in the local press, and accused of writing letters to the ministry that mischaracterized the situation. [...] Although he was challenged to release those letters he refused. [...] Opposition agents in London were eventually able to acquire some of his letters, which reached members of the Sons of Liberty in April 1769. [...] They were promptly published by the radical Boston Gazette, along with deliberations of the governor's council. [...] One letter in particular, in which Bernard called for changes to the Massachusetts charter to increase the governor's power by increasing the council's dependence on him, was the subject of particularly harsh treatment, and prompted the assembly to formally request that [...] "he might be forever removed from the Government of the Province." [...] He was recalled to England, and Lieutenant Governor Hutchinson became acting governor. [...] When Bernard left Boston on 1 August, the town held an impromptu celebration, decorated the Liberty Tree, <b>and</b> <b>rang</b> church bells.|$|E
500|$|Several {{isolated}} incidents against Christians {{were reported}} from 17 August onwards, and on 29 August some 45,000 institutions across India {{participated in a}} [...] "prayer for peace and communal harmony" [...] {{in response to the}} ongoing anti-Christian violence in Orissa. St. Aloysius College, a Jesuit institution in Mangalore, and some other 2000 Christian schools in Karnataka went on strike for varying periods between 29 August and 5 September prior to the attacks, protesting against the events in Orissa, in defiance of the orders of the government who stated that {{it was to be a}} regular work day. This led to government denouncement of the Christian institutions in the state for disobeying orders and led to a Bajrang Dal demonstration outside the St. Aloysius College, two weeks prior to the main attacks. The attacks began on 14 September, when a group of youths from the Bajrang Dal went inside the chapel of Adoration Monastery of the Sisters of St-Clare near the Milagres Church in Hampankatta and desecrated it. Some 20 churches or prayer halls, including Catholic and Protestant churches and temples belonging to the Jehovah's Witnesses and other evangelical sects, and colleges were damaged in towns and villages in the Mangalore taluk and other parts of Dakshina Kannada district, Udupi district and Chikkamagaluru district. A few Christian institutions were later attacked in Bangalore and Kasaragod district. Out of frustration and anger, the Christian community responded to the attacks within hours and began protesting. In Karkala, the Catholics of Karkala deanery staged a protest on 15 September and organised a 3 kilometre silent protest march. The protesters blocked arterial city roads in their masses, especially in places such as Hampankatta, Kulshekar, Bejai, Derebail and Thokottu <b>and</b> <b>rang</b> bells in almost all the churches of Mangalore, calling parishioners to their churches. The protests led to strong police suppression with lathi charges and tear gas, making around 150 arrests and injuring 30 to 40 people. The incident marked the first time that Catholics had ever resorted to violence in Mangalore when provoked. Between 15 September and 10 October, a new wave of anti-minority attacks began against Christian communities in the Indian states of Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, New Delhi, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Uttarakhand, as well as Muslim communities in Gujarat and Maharashtra.|$|E
