The spectra of these high redshift objects show a narrow, isolated Ly alpha emission with very faint (frequently undetected) continuum, indicating a large equivalent width. No other features are visible in our spectra. Our Ly <b>alpha</b> <b>emitters</b> are quite similar to those found by Hu (1998), Cowie & Hu (1998) and Hu et al. (1998). Using simple population synthesis models, on the assumption that these sources are regions of star formation, we conclude that the nebulae are nearly optically thick and must have a very low dust content, in order to explain the high observed Ly alpha equivalent widths. For the cosmological and star formation parameters we adopted, the total stellar mass produced would seem to correspond to the formation of rather small galaxies, some of which are perhaps destined to merge. The implied star formation density in our sampled comoving volume is probably somewhat smaller than, but of the same order of magnitude as the star formation density at z= 3 derived by other authors from Lyman-break galaxy surveys. This result agrees with the expectation that the Ly <b>alpha</b> <b>emitters</b> are a low-metallicity (or low-dust) tail in a distribution of star forming regions at high redshifts.

When absorbed in air, alpha particles generate radioluminescence light, which can be used for detection purposes, provided that background lighting levels are adequately low. In this study, three low-light sensitive camera technologies (CCD, EMCCD and ICCD) were utilized in a nuclear facility, and their performance in detecting <b>alpha</b> <b>emitters</b> was investigated. The results show that low read-out noise is essential for the detection of radioluminescence, as it allows short exposure times to be used. The ICCD was found to perform slightly better than the EMCCD in the field, while both cameras enable the detection of MBqlevel alpha activities in 100 s in the test configuration.

The continuum red-ward of the Lyman alpha line is clearly detected in both objects, thus facilitating a relatively accurate measurement (10 [...] 20 % uncertainties) of the observed rest-frame equivalent widths, which are around 160 Angstroms for both objects. Through detailed modelling of the profile of the Lyman alpha line with a 3 -D Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code, we estimate the intrinsic rest-frame equivalent width of Lyman alpha and find values that are around 300 Angstroms, which is at {{the upper end of the}} range allowed for very young, moderately metal-poor star-forming galaxies. However, the uncertainties are large and values as high as 700 Angstroms are permitted by the data. Both Lyman <b>alpha</b> <b>emitters</b> are detected at 3. 6 micron in deep images taken with the Spitzer Space Telescope. We use these measurements, the measurement of the continuum red-ward of Lyman alpha and other photometry to constrain the spectral energy distributions of these very luminous Lyman <b>alpha</b> <b>emitters</b> and to compare them to three similar Lyman <b>alpha</b> <b>emitters</b> from the literature. The contribution from nebular emission is included in our models: excluding it results in significantly higher masses.
