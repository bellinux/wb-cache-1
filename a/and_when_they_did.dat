5|$|Landscape was a {{secondary}} concern to Netherlandish painters before the mid 1460s. Geographical settings were rare <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> appear usually consisted of glimpses through open windows or arcades. They were rarely based on actual locations; the settings {{tended to be}} largely imagined, designed to suit the thematic thrust of the panel. Because most of the works were donor portraits, very often the landscapes were tame, controlled and served merely to provide a harmonious setting for the idealised interior space. In this, the northern artists lagged behind their Italian counterparts who were already placing their sitters within geographically identifiable and closely described landscapes. Some of the northern landscapes are highly detailed and notable in their own right, including van Eyck's unsentimental c.1430 Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych and van der Weyden's widely copied 1435–40 Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} October 9, 2002 and wrapped by March 7, 2003. The quick shoot was only marred by two accidents: as Jack Sparrow steals the Interceptor, {{three of the}} ropes attaching it to the Dauntless did not break at first, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> snap, debris hit Depp's knee, though he was not injured, {{and the way the}} incident played out on film made it look like Sparrow merely ducks. A more humorous accident was when the boat Sparrow was supposed to arrive in at Port Royal sank. In October, the crew was shooting scenes at Rancho Palos Verdes, by December they were shooting at Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and in January they were at the cavern set at Los Angeles. The script often changed with Elliott and Rossio on set, with additions such as Gibbs (Kevin McNally) telling Will how Sparrow allegedly escaped from an island – strapping two turtles together with rope made of his back hair – and Pryce was written into the climactic battle to keep some empathy for the audience.|$|E

25|$|A {{revolution}} in 1932 ended the absolute monarchy {{and raised the}} possibility that King Prajadhipok might abdicate. Queen Savang Vadhana, his grandmother, was concerned about Prince Ananda Mahidol's safety, since {{he was one of}} the likely heirs to the throne. It was then suggested that Mom Sangwal and her children return to Lausanne, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> so in 1933, the official reason given was for the health and further education of the princes.|$|E
25|$|Under Culverhouse, the Bucs {{were one}} of the NFL's more {{profitable}} teams during the 1980s; however, this was largely because he kept the payroll among the lowest in the league, hampering their ability to sign quality players.

25|$|Following South Carolina's {{unanimous}} 1860 secession vote, {{no other}} Southern states considered the question until 1861, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> none had a unanimous vote. All had residents who cast {{significant numbers of}} Unionist votes in either the legislature, conventions, popular referendums, or in all three. Voting {{to remain in the}} Union did not necessarily mean that individuals were northern sympathizers. Once hostilities began, many of these who voted to remain in the Union, particularly in the Deep South, accepted the majority decision, and supported the Confederacy.|$|E
25|$|Though this {{principle}} was {{implicit in the}} Act and in the King's new titles, and {{came out of a}} Commonwealth Conference, neither the British government nor the dominion governments seemed initially to grasp its significance. So while the Irish immediately put the principle into effect by assuming the right to select their own governor-general and to demand a direct right of audience with the King (excluding British ministers), other dominions were much slower to go down this path, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> so, they were faced with determined, though ultimately futile, attempts to block such evolution in London.|$|E
25|$|At the time, {{single mothers}} were the poorest sector in society, {{disadvantaged}} {{for at least}} four reasons. First, women had longer lifespans, often leaving them widowed with children. Second, women's work opportunities were few, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> find work, their wages were lower than male workers' wages. Third, women were often less likely to marry or remarry after being widowed, leaving them as the main providers for the remaining family members. Finally, poor women had deficient diets, because their husbands and children received disproportionately large shares of food. Many women were malnourished and had limited access to health care.|$|E

25|$|ABC hardly showed any {{baseball}} games {{during the regular}} season in the 1980s <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> it was only on either Monday or Thursday nights from the end of Sweeps Week in late May until the NFL preseason started {{in the first week of}} August - and then you wouldn't see them again until the playoffs. ABC also had a clause where they could air a game the last day of the regular season if it had playoff implications, such as in 1987 in regards to the Detroit Tigers' American League East pennant chase against the Toronto Blue Jays. However, in 1986, ABC did do a number of early season Sunday afternoon games before they went into Monday Night Baseball.|$|E
25|$|Essex County Cricket Club {{played their}} cricket during the 2005 season in Division Two of the County Championship and Division One of the Sunday League. They started the season 8–1 {{to win the}} Second Division Title, and were second in the Championship table at 9 May, but five matches without a win {{following}} that sent them down to fifth place at the Twenty20 break in June.

In the C Trophy, they went out to Lancashire at the second round stage, while they finished fifth in the group stage of the Twenty20 Cup, two points off a guaranteed quarter-final spot.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, {{helicopters}} {{had begun to}} replace fixed–wing aircraft and supplement the marine craft in the search and rescue role, {{with the introduction of}} the Westland Wessex and later the Westland Sea King, it was now possible to consider the replacement of marine craft in all sea and weather conditions. However, even into the 1970s helicopters had not completely replaced RAF marine craft, however by this time the Marine Branch craft were becoming increasingly elderly and service in the Branch increasingly unattractive. Physically isolated from the majority of RAF bases and personnel, with the withdrawal of the flying boats and the absorption of Coastal Command into Strike Command, the majority of RAF bases were now inland; the Marine Branch became largely forgotten and neglected {{by the rest of the}} Royal Air Force. The only interaction between the Marine Branch and the rest of the RAF was when the Branch had to draw supplies from another base, or when aircrew arrived at Mount Batten for safety and survival training. Associating the RAF with the conducting of flight operations, other members of the RAF, like the public at large, were often unaware that the RAF had its own marine craft or why they were needed, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> become aware of the fact, found it strange and surprising.|$|E
25|$|Sultans Baybars and Qalawun, and the Syrian viceroys of an-Nasir Muhammad {{during his}} first two reigns, emirs Salar and Baybars II, were averse to {{granting}} Bedouin sheikhs iqtaʿat, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> the iqtaʿat were of low quality. However, during an-Nasir Muhammad's third reign, the Al Fadl were granted high-quality iqtaʿat in abundance, strengthening the tribe {{to become the most}} powerful among the Bedouin of the Syrian Desert region. Beyond his personal admiration of the Bedouin, an-Nasir Muhammad's motivation for distributing iqtaʿat to Al Fadl, especially under the leadership of Muhanna ibn Isa, was to prevent them from defecting to the Ilkhanate, which their leaders had done frequently {{in the first half of}} the 14th century. Competition over iqtaʿat and the post of amir al-ʿarab among the Bedouin tribes of Syria, particularly the Al Fadl, led to conflict and rebellion among the two tribes and other Bedouin, leading to mass bloodshed in Syria in the aftermath of an-Nasir Muhammad's death. The Mamluk leadership in Syria, weakened by the losses of the Black Plague, was unable to quell the Bedouin through military expeditions, so they resolved to assassinate the sheikhs of the tribes. including those of Upper Egypt. The Al Fadl tribe eventually lost favor, while the Bedouin tribes of al-Karak were strengthened by the later Bahri sultans.|$|E
