6000|$|... "Great changes {{always bring}} small discomforts," [...] Wolfenden rejoined. [...] "But after all I didn't {{come here to}} talk nonsense. I came to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> something. I {{want to know whether}} you fellows are bent upon seeing this thing through?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{did not act}} without consideration," [...] Mr. Richards said calmly. [...] "Norris had gone, and I {{resolved}} if {{he returned}} again to say what I had learned; but my proofs were not absolute. We had made, it seemed to me, a terrible mistake, and I {{did not wish to}} cause ruin to another boy unless it was absolutely necessary to do so to clear Norris. Now that he has returned I can no longer hesitate; but before I begin I must <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> whether your suspicions have fallen on any one else?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'May I speak? Thank you. This is {{a little}} embarrassing. When I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> to meet me here, {{it was not for}} the purpose of holding an auction. I had a straight-forward {{business}} proposition to make to you. It will necessitate a certain amount of plain and somewhat personal speaking. May I proceed? Thank you. I will be as brief as possible.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{a junior}} attach√© at the Russian Embassy," [...] Wolfenden said, {{stirring}} his coffee. [...] "Only just been appointed. Charlie Meynell {{gave him a}} line of introduction to me; {{said he was a}} decent sort, but mopish! I looked him up last week, met him in Pall Mall just as you came along, and <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> to supper. What liqueurs, Harcutt?" ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{they entered}} a boy came up. [...] "Oh, Scudamore, Jackson's been <b>asking</b> for <b>you</b> <b>both.</b> It's {{something}} particular, for {{he has been}} out three or four times, {{and he wanted to}} send after you, but no one knew where you had gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have a {{few words}} more to say," [...] she resumed, {{addressing}} my wife. [...] "You are the only married woman who has come to our little dinner party. The marked absence of the other wives explains itself. It is {{not for me to}} say whether they are right or wrong in refusing to sit at our table. My dear husband--who knows my whole life as well as I know it myself--expressed the wish that we should invite these ladies. He wrongly supposed that his estimate of me would be the estimate accepted by his friends; and neither he nor I anticipated that the misfortunes of my past life would be revealed by some person acquainted with them, whose treachery we have yet to discover. The least I can do, by way of acknowledging your kindness, is to place you in the same position toward me which the other ladies now occupy. The circumstances under which I have become the wife of Mr. Germaine are, in some respects, very remarkable. They are related, without suppression or reserve, in a little narrative which my husband wrote, at the time of our marriage, for the satisfaction of one of his absent relatives, whose good opinion he was unwilling to forfeit. The manuscript is in this portfolio. After what has happened, I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> to read it, as a personal favor to me. It is for you to decide, when you know all, whether I am a fit person for an honest woman to associate with or not." ...|$|E
50|$|Schematic capture {{involves}} {{not only}} entering the circuits into the CAD system, but also generally calls for decisions {{that may seem}} more appropriate for later in the design, such as package choice. Although {{you may be able}} to change the package later, many PCB CAD systems <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to choose <b>both</b> the part and package when placing it into the schematic capture program.|$|R
6000|$|... "Glad to see <b>you</b> <b>both</b> so ruddy; Cobhurst air {{must agree}} with you. And now, before we say {{anything}} else, let me <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a question: Have {{you had your}} supper?" ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{could not}} speak to one another till not only matins but breakfast were ended, and then--after the {{somewhat}} solid meal--the ladies had to put on their out-of-door gear to attend Queen Mary in her daily exercise. The dress was not much, high summer as it was, only a loose veil over the stiff cap, and a fan in the gloved hand to act as parasol. However the retirement gave Cicely an interval in which to say, [...] "O mother, she has told me," [...] and as Susan sat holding out her arms, the adopted child threw herself on her knees, hiding her face on that bosom where she had found comfort all her life, and where, her emotion at last finding full outlet, she sobbed without knowing why for some moments, till she started nervously {{at the entrance of}} Richard, saying, [...] "The Queen is <b>asking</b> for <b>you</b> <b>both.</b> But how now? Is all told?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes?" [...] {{she said}} calmly and interrogatively, {{and made a}} pause, but as he did not {{specially}} apply his remark to anybody or anything, she continued: [...] "If these flowers of rhetoric are over, what I {{have to say is}} this: I do not intend to stay in this horrid place any longer. I am going to-morrow to my brother Garsington. They <b>asked</b> us <b>both,</b> <b>you</b> may remember, but for reasons best known to yourself, you would not go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A good name," [...] Sir Timothy murmured. [...] "I am sure I wish <b>you</b> <b>both</b> {{every good}} fortune in your quest. Would it {{be too much}} to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> now, Mr. Ledsam, for that single minute alone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} very pleased indeed," [...] Nigel replied. [...] "Won't <b>you</b> <b>both</b> come and dine in Belgrave Square to-night? I was going to <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> anyhow, Chalmers. Naida Karetsky has promised to come, and my cousin will be hostess." ...|$|R
5000|$|On November 5, 2009 {{the first}} day {{eligible}} players could file for free agency, the Angels signed Bobby Abreu to a two-year deal, with a club option for 2012. Soon after, general manager Tony Reagins stated the team's focus was on re-signing Lackey and Figgins. [...] A few days later, owner Arte Moreno added he wanted to retain both Lackey and Figgins, but with limited payroll options, would have to choose {{just one of the}} two stars. [...] "If you look at what they're <b>asking,</b> <b>you</b> can't bring <b>both</b> of them back", Moreno said. Negotiations with Guerrero also stalled, as Moreno added, [...] "We've talked to his agent just recently. We talked to his agent two years ago. We could never get close enough. It's very emotional for us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] said Venn earnestly, [...] "she {{knows nothing}} {{whatever}} about it. It is only I who <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{to give him}} up. It will be better for her and <b>you</b> <b>both.</b> People will say bad things if they find out that a lady secretly meets {{a man who has}} ill-used another woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} seen a great deal with Miss Brooks lately--on the street and elsewhere--acting as her escort, and evidently on terms of intimacy. To do <b>you</b> <b>both</b> justice, neither of you seemed to have made it a secret or avoided observation; but I must <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{directly}} if it is with her mother's permission?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{twinkle in}} Nellie Austerly's eyes grew plainer. [...] "I {{can be quite}} frank with Mr. Valentine and you, and perhaps it is because I like <b>you</b> <b>both.</b> <b>You</b> can make what you think fit of that. Still, I haven't <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> how long you have been on board the schooner, and one understands there are a good many {{opportunities}} for men--like you and Mr. Valentine--in this country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 23. I only <b>ask,</b> have <b>you</b> got <b>both</b> the ten pounds, or {{only the}} first; I hope <b>you</b> mean <b>both.</b> Pray be good housewives; and I beg you to walk when you can, for health. Have you the horse in town? {{and do you}} ever ride him? how often? Confess. Ahhh, sirrah, have I caught you? Can you {{contrive}} to let Mrs. Fenton(22) know, that the request she has made me in her letter I will use what credit I have to bring about, although I hear it is very difficult, and I doubt I shall not succeed? Cox {{is not to be}} your Chancellor: all joined against him. I have been supping with Lord Peterborow at his house, with Prior, Lewis, and Dr. Freind. 'Tis the ramblingest lying rogue on earth. Dr. Raymond is come to town: 'tis late, and so I bid you good-night.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{something}} to attend to," [...] said Clarence, with a faint smile, [...] "and I must <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> and Susy to excuse me for a little while. She knows the house perfectly, and will call the servants from the annex to provide <b>you</b> <b>both</b> with refreshment until I join you a little later." [...] Satisfied from Hooker's manner that they knew nothing of his later interview with Pinckney, he turned away and ascended to his own room.|$|R
6000|$|... "John {{is a good}} man, but he has his faults, and {{you must}} learn to see and bear with them, remembering your own. He is very decided, but never will be obstinate, if you reason kindly, not oppose impatiently. He is very accurate, and {{particular}} about the truth--a good trait, though you call him 'fussy'. Never deceive him by look or word, Meg, and he {{will give you the}} confidence you deserve, the support you need. He has a temper, not like ours--one flash and then all over--but the white, still anger that is seldom stirred, but once kindled is hard to quench. Be careful, be very careful, not to wake his anger against yourself, for peace and happiness depend on keeping his respect. Watch yourself, be the first to <b>ask</b> pardon if <b>you</b> <b>both</b> err, and guard against the little piques, misunderstandings, and hasty words that often pave the way for bitter sorrow and regret." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Mary," [...] he said, [...] "and Miss Shaw, I {{know that}} <b>you</b> are <b>both</b> anxious {{for me to}} explain why I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to meet me here this afternoon, and why I also {{requested}} my friend Mr. Dory from Scotland Yard, who has charge of the case against Captain Sotherst, to be present. I will tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew how}} it would be!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I leave <b>you</b> <b>both</b> alone {{for less than a}} minute, and there you sit, as grave as two owls. I <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> now, is this the place to wander off into the clouds? When two people sit looking at each other as you were doing a minute ago, here in Luigi's, at midnight, with {{champagne}} in their glasses, and a supper, ordered regardless of expense, on the table before them, they are either without the least sense of the fitness of things, or else--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose I ought {{never to}} have <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> for it," [...] he wrote, [...] "but you are always so deliciously solemn about money matters that I couldn't resist. Just heard the news of your {{engagement}} to Courtenay. Congrats. to <b>you</b> <b>both.</b> I'm far too stoney broke to buy you a wedding present so I'm {{going to give you}} back the bread-and- butter dish. Luckily it still has your crest on it. I shall love to think of you and Courtenay eating bread-and-butter out of {{it for the rest of}} your lives." ...|$|R
25|$|Baxter: I did not <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{whether you}} like them; I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> whether there were any about that night.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ada, my dear," [...] said Mr. Jarndyce, {{recovering}} his cheerfulness, [...] "these {{are strong}} words of advice, but I live in Bleak House and {{have seen a}} sight here. Enough of that. All Richard had to start him in the race of life is ventured. I recommend to him and you, for his sake and your own, that he should depart from us {{with the understanding that}} there is no sort of contract between you. I must go further. I will be plain with <b>you</b> <b>both.</b> <b>You</b> were to confide freely in me, and I will confide freely in <b>you.</b> I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> wholly to relinquish, for the present, any tie but your relationship." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{need not}} <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> how you are, my boy," [...] Mr. Renshaw said as Wilfrid, who had leapt from his horse as Marion ran up, hastened forward {{with her to}} the house. [...] "Your mother has told us so much about your illness that I hardly {{anticipated}} seeing you looking a picture of health. Mr. Atherton, I am delighted to see you. My wife has told me how much we all owe to <b>you</b> <b>both</b> for your care of Wilfrid and for having brought him and my wife safely {{out of the hands of}} the natives." ...|$|R
60|$|THE EDITOR. But I don't <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{to do it}} to save yourself: I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to do it {{to oblige}} me personally.|$|R
6000|$|... "Granville," [...] he said slowly, like {{a broken}} man, [...] "I don't <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to forgive me; you can never forgive me; I don't <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to sympathise with me; a father knows better than to accept sympathy from a son; but I do <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to bear with me while I try to explain myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|W. I don't <b>ask</b> <b>thee</b> what he promises, or by whom; but I <b>ask</b> <b>thee</b> this: Canst thou {{say that}} thou believest {{he intends to}} perform it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{anything}} of the sort," [...] he interrupted--"I wouldn't <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> for the world; and my own bright plan for achieving the coup you mention------" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Carrie; {{you think}} I'm going to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to love me. I'm not. And I'm {{not going to}} <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{to come back to}} Gopher Prairie!" ...|$|R
6000|$|BURKE--[Misunderstanding her--with a grin.] You're waiting till <b>you</b> do be <b>asked,</b> <b>you</b> mane? Well, I'm <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> now. And we'll {{be married}} this day, {{with the help}} of God! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to observe," [...] he said, [...] "when you {{complain}} that I go very fast, that, after all, I {{have so far}} <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> for nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I {{wanted to}} <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> and Fred and Charley," [...] {{she said in}} a quavering voice. [...] "That 's what I called <b>you</b> in for--to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who <b>asks</b> <b>you?</b> I {{do not ask}} you; nobody <b>asks</b> <b>you.</b> I do {{not want}} you to marry any one. I did think once--but let that pass. You are now twenty-three. In ten years' time you will still be a young man. I only <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to wait. If you marry now, that is, marry such a girl as Mary Thorne--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is a question, miss," [...] {{she said}} at last, abruptly, [...] "I should like to <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> I should have <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> when you first came, if I had been in {{when you came to}} look at the rooms." ...|$|R
