5|$|Early worship {{took place}} at the parish church of Manchester, however a small chantry chapel existed in 1368 on the only bridge linking the two settlements.

In 1634–35, Humphrey Booth, a wealthy local merchant, opened <b>a</b> <b>chapel</b> of ease, which a year later was consecrated as the Chapel of Sacred Trinity (the parish of Sacred Trinity was created in 1650).

5|$|It has {{traditionally}} been held in Osney that the church was founded in the reign of Stephen, but this {{is unlikely to be}} true, as Thomas Becket was not martyred until some fifteen years after Stephen's death. It is known that in the 1180s, the site was granted to the canons of the nearby Osney Abbey, and <b>a</b> <b>chapel</b> was erected on the site around 1190. From the mid-13th century the Osney area was referred to as the parish of St Thomas', but it remained nominally <b>a</b> <b>chapel</b> of the abbey until the dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII, when it was placed under Christ Church, Oxford.
