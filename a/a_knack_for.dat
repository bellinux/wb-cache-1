5|$|Talented slaves with <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> <b>for</b> {{business}} might accumulate a {{large enough}} peculium to justify their freedom, or be manumitted for services rendered. Manumission had become frequent enough that in 2 BC a law (Lex Fufia Caninia) limited the number of slaves an owner was allowed to free in his will.|$|E
5|$|Having {{grown up}} in a hospital, Meredith shows immense natural talent. She {{possesses}} a steadfast, calm ease during medical procedures and emergencies, and is a natural observer of people. She exhibits <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> <b>for</b> catching subtle hints and accurately determining difficult-to-catch diagnoses. Her placid, non-judgmental bedside manner often causes people to open up and trust her. Her surgical skills are solidly impressive and she shows a talent and patience for medical research trials and dealing with psychologically damaged patients.|$|E
5|$|Browning {{supervised}} {{the newly formed}} division as it underwent a prolonged period of expansion and intensive training, with new brigades raised and assigned to the division, and new equipment tested. Though not considered an airborne warfare visionary, he proved adept at dealing with an apathetic War Office and an obstructionist Air Ministry, and demonstrated <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> <b>for</b> overcoming bureaucratic obstacles. As the airborne forces expanded in size, the major difficulty in getting the 1st Airborne Division ready for operations was a shortage of aircraft. The Royal Air Force had neglected air transport before the war, and the only available aircraft for airborne troops were conversions of obsolete bombers like the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley. Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris in particular felt that the 1st Airborne Division was not worth the drain on Bomber Command's resources.|$|E

25|$|She had <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> <b>for</b> {{being at}} {{the right place at}} the right time: she interviewed and photographed Mohandas K. Gandhi just a few hours before his {{assassination}} in 1948. Alfred Eisenstaedt, her friend and colleague, said one of her strengths was that there was no assignment and no picture that was unimportant to her. She also started the first photography laboratory at Life magazine.|$|E

25|$|Rayburn {{also had}} <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> <b>for</b> {{dressing}} to suit his occasion. While in Washington, D.C., he would sport expensive suits, starched shirts, and perfectly shined shoes. However, while {{back in his}} poorer district in Texas, Rayburn would wear simple shirts, blue jeans, cowboy boots, and cowboy hats. Several politicians have imitated this pattern, including Ronald Reagan's famous example of clearing brush when at home in California, while wearing fine suits in Washington.|$|E
25|$|Bullock {{took his}} job seriously, deputizing several {{residents}} and tackling {{the job of}} civilizing the camp. Despite (or perhaps because of) a reputation for fearlessness and an uncompromising nature, Bullock managed the task without killing anyone. Bullock had several 'run ins' with Al Swearengen, proprietor of the notorious Gem Theater, Deadwood's most notable brothel. Swearengen had <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> <b>for</b> making money from vice and shrewdly invested some of his profits in cultivating alliances with the camp's wealthy and powerful.|$|E
25|$|The two admirals were a {{contrast}} in styles. Halsey was aggressive and a risk taker. Spruance was calculating and cautious. Notwithstanding their different personalities, Spruance and Halsey were close friends. In fact, Spruance had <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> <b>for</b> {{getting along with}} difficult people, including his friend Admiral Kelly Turner, the hotheaded commander of 5th Fleet's amphibious force. One exception was Admiral John Towers, a constant critic of Spruance, whom Spruance came to despise for his naked ambition.|$|E

As of Season 3, {{they are}} aware of the clones, but think they are simply Alison's sisters.

25|$|If past {{records and}} current {{conditions}} indicate {{anything about the}} area, they show the area breeds entrepreneurship; whether numbering 286 currently or 1,348 in 1929, residents seem to have <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> <b>for</b> being industrious, always looking to expand a new building purchased, or a new business started. From the first Métis in the area, looking for better hunting grounds in 1871, to a thriving museum, housed in a building nearly 100 years old, stories of growth and expansion abound in this quaint town’s history.|$|E

50|$|The case is solved. As Holmes and Adler {{say their}} goodbyes, Adler {{comments}} {{that her son}} has a keen intellect and <b>a</b> certain <b>knack</b> <b>for</b> solving puzzles, implying that Holmes may be his father.

25|$|Founder Paul Brown {{coached the}} team for its first eight seasons. One of Brown's college draft {{strategies}} was to draft players with above-average intelligence. Punter/wide receiver Pat McInally attended Harvard University and linebacker Reggie Williams attended Dartmouth College and served on Cincinnati city council while on the Bengals' roster. Because of this policy, many former players were highly articulate {{and went on to}} have successful careers in commentary and broadcasting as well as the arts. In addition, Brown had <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> <b>for</b> locating and recognizing pro football talent in unusual places.|$|E
25|$|Several {{variations}} of the story are also found in Greek mythology as well. The story is attested in the legend of Zeus slaying the hundred-headed Typhon from Hesiod's Theogony, {{but it is also}} in the myths of the slaying of the nine-headed Lernaean Hydra by Heracles and the slaying of Python by Apollo. The story of Heracles's theft of the cattle of Geryon is probably also related. Although Heracles is not usually thought of as a storm deity in the conventional sense, he bears many attributes held by other Indo-European storm deities, including physical strength and <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> <b>for</b> violence and gluttony.|$|E
25|$|The {{height of}} Nimzowitsch's career was the late 1920s and early 1930s. Chessmetrics places {{him as the}} third {{best player in the}} world from 1927 to 1931, behind Alexander Alekhine and José Capablanca. His most notable successes were first-place {{finishes}} at Copenhagen 1923, Marienbad 1925, Dresden 1926, Hanover 1926, the Carlsbad 1929 chess tournament, and second place behind Alekhine at the San Remo 1930 chess tournament. Nimzowitsch never developed <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> <b>for</b> match play, though; his best match success was a draw with Alekhine, but the match consisted of only two games and took place in 1914, thirteen years before Alekhine became world champion.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an article}} titled [...] "Understanding Unconscious Intelligence and Intuition: Blink and Beyond", Lois Isenman agrees with Gladwell that the {{unconscious}} mind has <b>a</b> surprising <b>knack</b> <b>for</b> 'thinking without thinking' but argues that {{its ability to}} integrate many pieces of information simultaneously provides a much more inclusive explanation than thin-slicing.

We could see right away that Holmes had the knack." ...|$|R
25|$|Along with Williams, the Outlaws roster {{included}} rookie Oklahoma State star RB Ernest Anderson. Former Pittsburgh Steelers {{defensive coordinator}} Woody Widenhofer coached the team. Williams {{had been one}} of the biggest NFL stars to bolt to the USFL. He left the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after they offered him a contract that would have still made him among the lowest-paid starters in the league, even though it would have been triple his previous salary. Williams was not a very refined, efficient, or consistent passer at that point in addition to being a little rusty, but had a big arm and <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> <b>for</b> making plays.|$|E
25|$|Barks {{initially}} {{worked as}} an inbetweener. This involved being teamed and supervised {{by one of the}} head animators who did the key poses of character action (often known as extremes) for which the inbetweeners did the drawings between the extremes to create the illusion of movement. While an inbetweener, Barks submitted gag ideas for cartoon story lines being developed and showed such <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> <b>for</b> creating comical situations that by 1937 he was transferred to the story department. His first story sale was the climax of Modern Inventions, for a sequence where a robot barber chair gives Donald Duck a haircut on his bottom.|$|E
25|$|Bird is also {{remembered as}} an {{excellent}} defender. While he was neither fast nor quick-footed, {{and could not}} always shut down an individual player one-on-one, he consistently displayed <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> <b>for</b> anticipating the moves of his opponent, allowing him to intercept passes and create turnovers. His 1,556 career steals ranks 34th all-time. Unspectacular but effective defensive moves, such as jumping into a passing lane to make a steal or allowing his man to step past and drive to the hoop, then blocking the opponent's shot from behind, were staples of Bird's defensive game. In recognition of his defensive abilities, Bird was named to three All-Defensive Second Teams.|$|E
5000|$|Pulitzer had <b>an</b> uncanny <b>knack</b> <b>for</b> {{appealing}} to the common man.

Crusades for reform and news of entertainment were the two main staples for the 'World.' ...|$|R
