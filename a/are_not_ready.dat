5|$|The academy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{expensive}} in Europe, operating at a cost of £5million a year. The main cost is the dormitory, La Masia itself. The minimum age for the youth program is six years; each year, more than 1,000boys from the ages of six to eight try out for admittance. The best 200 are selected. The club also actively seeks for prospective students; it employs a system in which 15scouts are deployed in Catalonia, 15 in the rest of Spain and 10 scattered throughout the world. To alleviate the expenses of this scouting, the club has an agreement with 15 local clubs for them to train players who <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> for entry into the youth academy. In return, FC Barcelona gives money, coaching and technical advice to these clubs for their services. While expanding its operations abroad, the club established five schools in Mexico and one in Egypt; successful applicants to these schools become full-time students, receiving academic education and football training.|$|E

The bat may also need raw linseed oil, which fills in the gaps between the fibres.|$|E
25|$|The {{industrial}} {{areas of the}} Union-Miles Park neighborhood are clustered primarily along the railroad tracks.

25|$|In early February, the {{government}} and the FARC once again found themselves at odds, {{on the issue of the}} plebiscite. The FARC, by communiqué, argued that the plebiscite contravened the general agreement (from August 2012). In response, President Santos tweeted that the final agreement in Havana would be submitted to plebiscite, whether the FARC liked it or not. In late February, the FARC's 'armed proselytism' during a 'political pedagogy' event (attended by Iván Marquez and other negotiators) in La Guajira stirred significant controversy. Since 2015, the FARC's negotiators had been authorized by {{the government}} to travel to Colombia to organize 'political pedagogy' events with their troops only, and till then all such activities had occurred without major problems. However, the presence of armed men mingling with the civilian population during this particular event in La Guajira rekindled fears about the use of weapons by the guerrilla during political events. President Santos notified the guerrilla that 'political pedagogy' events were suspended until further notice and issued an ultimatum that either a final agreement is signed on March 23 or it would be understood that the FARC <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> for peace. Semana considered the incident as a major blow to confidence and trust in the peace process, which came at a critical moment.|$|E

Picard demands to be returned to the Enterprise; Q calls him [...] "an impossibly stubborn human" [...] and refuses to take him back until he agrees to at least hear Q's requests. Q then transports them to Ten Forward, where Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), who recognizes him, warns Picard not to trust him. Q reveals that he wants to join the crew to assist them as they push further into unexplored regions of the galaxy, asserting they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> for the threats they will encounter. Picard chooses to make their own way into the unknown, and rejects Q's offer. Irritated by Picard's arrogance, Q snaps his fingers and sends the Enterprise thousands of light years across the galaxy, then disappears. Lt.
