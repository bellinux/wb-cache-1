5|$|As {{early as}} 1933, {{two years before}} US13 had been {{completed}} as a four-lane divided highway from Dover to Wilmington, Delawareans petitioned DSHD to extend the divided highway south to the Maryland state line at Selbyville or Delmar (US13), a proposition DSHD acknowledged but deferred {{due to lack of}} funding, lack of proper planning, and higher priorities elsewhere in the state. Instead of adding divided highway in southern Delaware, DSHD needed to resolve the problem of the deterioration of 15- to 25-year-old concrete roads, such as those along the DuPont Highway. The department planned to address the issue by patching the concrete surface as needed, adding concrete shoulders, and applying a layer of bituminous concrete, more commonly known as <b>asphalt</b> <b>concrete</b> or blacktop, over the entire width of concrete to provide a wearing surface.|$|E
25|$|The largest use {{of asphalt}} is for making <b>asphalt</b> <b>concrete</b> for road surfaces; this {{accounts}} for approximately 85% of the asphalt {{consumed in the}} United States. <b>Asphalt</b> <b>concrete</b> pavement mixes are typically composed of 5% asphalt cement and 95% aggregates (stone, sand, and gravel). Due to its highly viscous nature, asphalt cement must be heated {{so it can be}} mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing facility. The temperature required varies depending upon characteristics of the asphalt and the aggregates, but warm-mix asphalt technologies allow producers to reduce the temperature required. There are about 4,000 <b>asphalt</b> <b>concrete</b> mixing plants in the US, and a similar number in Europe.|$|E

The use of synthetic zeolites in hot mixed asphalt leads to easier compaction and, to a certain degree, allows cold weather paving and longer hauls.|$|E

The requisites for acceptance in the main Italian Contract Specifications were completely satisfied (Indirect Tensile Strength up to 1. 42 MPa, depending on the mixture) and the mechanical performance, in terms of permanent deformation resistance, resulted really interesting and promising.

The PMA concretes were found to show improvement in SD and APA rut resistance by more than 50 % and 60 %, respectively. The SD and APA rut depth showed a relatively high correlation (R 2 = 0. 81) each other at 60 o C.

25|$|The {{primary use}} (70%) of asphalt is in road construction, {{where it is}} used as the glue or binder mixed with {{aggregate}} particles to create <b>asphalt</b> <b>concrete.</b> Its other main uses are for bituminous waterproofing products, including production of roofing felt and for sealing flat roofs.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance {{treatments}} for <b>asphalt</b> <b>concrete</b> generally include thin asphalt overlays, crack sealing, surface rejuvenating, fog sealing, micro milling or diamond grinding and surface treatments. Thin surfacing preserves, protects and improves the functional {{condition of the}} road while reducing the need for routing maintenance, leading to extended service life without increasing structural capacity.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of refined asphalt is used in construction: primarily as a constituent of products used in paving and roofing applications. According {{to the requirements of}} the end use, asphalt is produced to specification. This is achieved either by refining or blending. It is estimated that the current world use of asphalt is approximately 102 million tonnes per year. Approximately 85% of all the asphalt produced is used as the binder in <b>asphalt</b> <b>concrete</b> for roads. It is also used in other paved areas such as airport runways, car parks and footways. Typically, the production of <b>asphalt</b> <b>concrete</b> involves mixing fine and coarse aggregates such as sand, gravel and crushed rock with asphalt, which acts as the binding agent. Other materials, such as recycled polymers (e.g., rubber tyres), may be added to the asphalt to modify its properties according to the application for which the asphalt is ultimately intended.|$|E

25|$|Concrete is a {{composite}} material composed of coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement that hardens over time. Most concretes used are lime-based concretes such as Portland cement concrete or concretes made with other hydraulic cements, such as ciment fondu. However, <b>asphalt</b> <b>concrete,</b> which is frequently used for road surfaces, is also a type of concrete, where the cement material is bitumen, and polymer concretes are sometimes used where the cementing material is a polymer.|$|E
25|$|Each {{of these}} devices {{can be made from}} a variety of materials, {{including}} <b>asphalt,</b> <b>concrete,</b> recycled plastic, metal, or vulcanized rubber. Several trade-offs must be made when selecting the material for a new speed cushion. Traditionally most vertical deflection devices have been constructed of asphalt or concrete. Due to the rigidity and durability of these materials, they have more permanence and are more effective at slowing traffic. However, they can be difficult to shape and form into consistent forms and precise dimensions.|$|E

Six different bituminous mixtures were optimized with both crushed limestone and reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) materials, at variable proportions (up to 40 % by weight of the aggregate), using a conventional bitumen as well as a polymer modified binder. A combined volumetric-mechanical mix design procedure, based on the gyratory compaction and the indirect tensile strength test, was adopted. The fatigue investigation was performed by means of four point bending tests, conducted at 20 °C and 10 Hz.

500|$|Although many South Pasadena {{residents}} {{opposed the}} division of the city that the parkway would bring, the city's voters elected supporters in the 1936 elections. The state, which had the power to put the road where it wished even had South Pasadena continued to oppose it, approved the route on April 4, 1936. The route used the Arroyo Seco's west bank to near Hough Street, where it crossed to the east and cut through South Pasadena to the south end of Broadway (now Arroyo Parkway) in Pasadena. Another project, the Arroyo Seco Flood Control Channel, was built by the Works Progress Administration before and during construction of the parkway to avoid damages from future floods. A number of state engineers toured East Coast roads in early 1938, including Chicago's Lake Shore Drive, full and modified cloverleaf interchanges in Massachusetts and New Jersey, and Robert Moses's parkway system in New York City. The parkway was the first road built in California under a 1939 freeway law that allowed access to be completely limited to a number of specified points. Although, in some areas, it was possible to use a standard diamond interchange, other locations required folded diamonds, or, as the engineers called them, [...] "compressed cloverleafs", where local streets often took the place of dedicated ramps, ending at the parkway with a sharp right turn required to enter or exit. The highway was designed with two 11–12foot (3.4-3.7m) lanes and one ten-foot (3.0m) shoulder in each direction, with the wider inside (passing) lanes paved in black <b>asphalt</b> <b>concrete</b> and the outside lanes paved in gray Portland cement concrete. The differently-colored lanes would encourage drivers to stay in their lanes. (By mid-1939, the state had decided to replace the shoulders with additional travel lanes for increased capacity; except on a short piece in South Pasadena, these were also paved with Portland cement. So that disabled vehicles could be safely removed from the roadway, about 50 [...] "safety bays" [...] were constructed in 1949 and 1950.)
