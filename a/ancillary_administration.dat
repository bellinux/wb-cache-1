A general classroom for 30 students needs to be 55 m², or more generously 62 m². A general art room for 30 students needs to be 83 m², but 104 m² for 3D textile work. A drama studio or a specialist science laboratory for 30 needs to be 90 m². Examples are given on how this can be configured for a 1,200 place secondary (practical specialism)., and 1,850 place secondary school.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} expenditure patterns {{at higher}} education institutions in recent years, {{in light of the}} spiraling cost of higher education. It utilizes data from the U. S. Department of Education's Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), begun in 1986, and the Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS), which goes back to 1966. IPEDS and HEGIS figures demonstrated that instruction predictably accounts for the largest percentage of total spending. While spending increased in almost all categories between 1977 and 1994, increases were smallest in the traditional areas of instruction, library, and plant operations, and largest in <b>ancillary</b> services and <b>administration.</b> Instructional spending as a percentage of total expenditures fell at public universities, public four-year colleges, and private four-year colleges. Research spending as a percentage of total expenditures increased significantly at private and public universities. Comparing different type...|$|R
40|$|In early 1998, we {{were asked}} by Corporate Communications to develop a {{facility}} for providing a subscription based internal company mailing list capability that would permit Senior Executive management to send messages on an irregular basis {{from anywhere in the}} world. Shortly thereafter, we were also asked to provide a one-use-only mechanism to send all 175, 000 worldwide employees a (self-qualifying) message of where internally to report perceived spam in order to support corporate efforts to reduce incoming spam through technical means. Much to our surprise, delivering this message was a technical non-event. The success of these efforts led Corporate Communications to request a more general system for permitting multiple mailings to targeted audiences, with a goal of completely eliminating the paper-based communications Management Information Bulletin systems, hopefully at considerable cost savings. Given time and budget constraints, we chose to base our solution on majordomo. This paper describes a scalable method for handling deliveries to multiple majordomo mailing lists with a minimum of <b>administration.</b> <b>Ancillary</b> issues such as sender authentication, message constraints, bounces, mail replies, and mailing list recipient management are also described. This system is in use literally daily in Boeing, and has easily supported lists as large as 150, 000 recipients- drawn from custom SQL queries of the company’s employee database. Conservative estimates of the savings in moving to a fully electronic communications mechanism exceed $ 1, 000, 000 per year with cycle time that has improved from several days to only a few hours...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ancillary</b> <b>{{administration}}</b> is [...] "the {{administration of}} a decedent's estate {{in a state}} {{other than the one}} in which she lived, for the purpose of disposing of property she owned there."

40|$|The deceased, a {{resident}} of Illinois, {{was killed in an}} automobile accident while driving in Cherry County, Nebraska. The family in the other car involved were residents of California; all were injured. The deceased’s insurer was an Illinois corporation doing business in Nebraska with offices in Lancaster County. The deceased’s estate was administered in his domicile, Cook County, Illinois. Subsequently the injured party made application for appointment of an administrator in Lancaster County, Nebraska. An administrator was appointed, but later dismissed on the objections of the deceased’s heir and the insurance company. The court was confronted with {{the question of whether the}} automobile indemnity insurance policy of the deceased non-resident motorist constituted sufficient assets to support <b>ancillary</b> <b>administration</b> in Nebraska. The court held there was sufficient estate to support administration. The case is of first impression in Nebraska, but the issue has been before several other courts, which, have come to widely differing results on the same, or very similar facts. Aside from the practical considerations, it appears that in some cases the granting of <b>ancillary</b> <b>administration</b> may have given the injured party a cause of action where he otherwise would have had none. On the other hand, when the legislature provides adequate methods of gaining jurisdiction of the domiciliary administrator there is no reason to appoint an <b>ancillary</b> <b>administration...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Commonwealth has {{consistently}} claimed that its subsidies for private insurance would relieve pressure on public hospitals. There {{has been some}} uptake of activity by private hospitals, but this rise is much more modest than the rise in participation in private insurance. The increased private hospital funding that has resulted from the subsidies is actually less than the outlays on the subsidies. To the extent they have paid for hospital services, the subsidies have gone largely {{to those who were}} already using private hospitals, with or without insurance. Because of leakages to <b>administration,</b> <b>ancillaries</b> and gap payments, support for private insurance has been a high cost way to support private hospitals. Public hospitals still have to carry the load of cases which private hospitals do not have the capacity to handle. At the same time, because of the subsidies, scarce resources, particularly skilled staff, have been drawn to the private sector. There is no relief of the pressure on public hospitals. In fact, because of the inflationary effects of private insurance, the whole health care system will bear high costs for so long as it relies on private insurance for a significant proportion of its funding. There is a case for supporting private hospitals, but not {{through the use of a}} high-cost financial intermediary. Direct funding of private hospitals, to bring their funding more into line with public hospital funding, would result in a fairer and more efficient allocation of scarce health care resources...|$|R
40|$|A {{recent case}} {{decided by the}} Appellate Court of Indiana raises the {{question}} of jurisdiction to appoint a personal representative for the purpose of bringing an action for wrongful death of decedent. In this case a petition was filed for the removal of the administrator and the cancellation of letters of administration. Decedent had been a resident of Illinois. While traveling in Indiana he was killed by alleged negligence of petitioner. The decedent had property in his possession in Indiana at his death consisting of twenty-five dollars in cash and a leather grip containing various articles of clothing, etc. It was held (1) that the claim for damages for the death of a non-resident by wrongful act of a person in Indiana will not support the appointment of a local ancillary administrator; (2) but that the existence of the personal property of the decedent in Indiana {{at the time of his}} death will support local <b>ancillary</b> <b>administration.</b> It may be added that when decedent died the personal property in his possession in Indiana was sent to the widow in Illinois. After the appoint of the local administrator the property was returned to him...|$|E
