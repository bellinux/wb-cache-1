40|$|Accession is {{the process}} of {{recording}} bibliographic units in an <b>accession</b> <b>register.</b> Typically,library materials are acquired by purchase, exchange, gift or legal deposit. How-ever, COBISS (Cooperative Online Bibliographic System and Services) Holdings software module includes some additional methods of acquisition which causes problems in gathering and presenting statistical data on local holdings. The article explains how to record holdings of different types of library materials and how to record retrospective collections. It describes necessary procedures in case the codes that define the publication pattern of the holdings are changed with special attention to integrating resources. Procedures of accession and circulation of bound materials, supplementary materials, teaching sets, multi parts, multimedia and collection level catalogue records are described. The attention is given to errors in recording lost item replacements and to the problems of circulation of certain types of library materials. The author also suggests how to record remote electronic resources. It is recommended to verify holdings data before the <b>accession</b> <b>register</b> is generated. The relevant and credible statistical data on collection development can only be created by librarians with sufficient acquisition and cataloguing skills...|$|R

40|$|Seven {{different}} accessions of velvet bean, Mucuna pruriens var utilis, {{gathered from}} different agroecological regions of Western Ghats, South India are evaluated for agrobotanical traits. They exhibited wide diversity {{in respect of}} all the investigated characters especially the traits responsible for the overall biomass of the plant. The accession Thachenmalai (black- coloured seed coat) exhibited the highest fertility index, biomass production and seed yield followed by Valanad accession (black – coloured seed coat). Seed recovery percentage ranged between 62. 08 ± 0. 19 % and 88. 70 ± 0. 50 %. Thachenmalai <b>accession</b> <b>registered</b> the highest seed recovery percentage among all the investigated accessions. Besides, the leghaemoglobin content of root nodules, the mineral profiles of soil before and after cultivation of velvet bean were also studied. Kailasanadu (white – coloured seed coat) accession showed relatively high content of leghaemoglobin level {{compared to the other}} accessions. The genotypic, phenotypic and environmental variance and their coefficient variance % were also calculated, which indicate that variations in agrobotanical traits are more due to impact of both the genotype and phenotype compared to environmental factors...|$|R
40|$|Cytoplasmic male {{sterility}} {{is widely used}} for hybrid breeding of sugar beets. Specific genotypes with a nonsterility-inducing cytoplasm and a nonrestoring allele of restorer-of-fertility gene (rf) are called maintainers. The infrequent occurrence of the maintainer genotype evokes the need to diagnose rf alleles. Molecular analysis of Rf 1, one of the sugar beet Rfs, revealed {{a high level of}} nucleotide sequence diversity, but three variants were tightly associated with maintainer selection in Japan. The question was raised whether this small number of variants would be seen in cases where a wider range of genetic resources was used for maintainer selection. Fifty-seven <b>accessions</b> <b>registered</b> as maintainers in the USDA germplasm collection were characterized in this study. Mitochondrial DNA types (mitotypes) of 551 plants were diagnosed based on minisatellite polymorphism. A mitotype associated with sterility-inducing (S) cytoplasm was identified in 58 plants, indicating S-cytoplasm contamination. The organization of rf 1 was investigated by two PCR markers and DNA gel blot analysis. Eight haplotypes were found among the US maintainers, but subsequently two haplotypes were judged as restoring alleles after a test cross and another haplotype was not inherited by the progeny. Nucleotide sequences of rf 1 regions in the remaining five haplotypes were compared, and despite the sequence diversity of the gene-flanking regions, the gene-coding regions were identified to be three types. Therefore, there are three rf 1 variants in US maintainers, the same number as in the Japanese sugar beet germplasm collection. The implications of having a small repertoire of rf 1 variants are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which selected New Zealand museums have collected the history of childhood from their inception to the present. No research on collecting the material culture of childhood has been done in New Zealand and international studies in this area have mainly focused on exhibitions. In breaking new ground, this study conducts an in-depth analysis of objects relating to children that have been acquired over time and it evaluates how and why the experiences and perspectives of children have been incorporated into collections, and therefore which childhood histories have been preserved. The case study {{at the heart of this}} thesis focuses on the history collections of two large metropolitan museums, the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa and the Auckland War Memorial Museum. This thesis employs a multi-method approach in order to gain information about the collections, the objects and museum practices as they relate to children and childhood. Close scrutiny of museum collection databases, object files and <b>accession</b> <b>registers</b> enabled the documentation of what was in the collections and what associated information was recorded. Current and long serving curators were interviewed to provide unique perspectives and personal reflections on the realities and complexities of their practice. In addition, published museum histories, archival information and planning documents provided crucial information on the strategic collecting direction of each museum from 1851 to 2007. This study provides important empirical evidence on collecting the material culture of childhood. The thesis also provides new insights into museum theory and practice and advances the premise that museum collections are shaped by the historical context within which they were created, whether at the level of social discourses or the activities of individual people. There were changes in the kinds of childhood objects collected, from ethnographic specimens to colonial and decorative arts objects, to everyday objects that embody multiple perspectives and personal stories. Contrary to conventional wisdom, exhibitions and the 'new museology' are shown to be a positive influence on the inclusion of childhood objects, especially things that embody the child's perspective. The way that childhood objects provide a tangible material link to the past, capturing an element of history that cannot be expressed in text-based form, is evident throughout this research. The thesis concludes by arguing that the distinctive way museums make history provides an important opportunity for museums to ensure that children are included, visible and heard in New Zealand history...|$|R

40|$|Malvasia nera {{is one of}} {{the minor}} cultivars {{belonging}} to the rich varietal ensemble of Tuscany. one of the most renowned Italian viticultural regìons. Starting from data produced in previous researches, it came out that in some cases under the name of 'Malvasia nera' it could be grown "Tempranillo", both in Tuscany and in Basilicata regions. Therefore we started a work to deep inside the identity of these black Malavasias and the results are referred in the present repoft. In particular, we focused on l 6 black Malvasias of Tuscany, keeping 4 <b>registered</b> clones plus <b>accessions</b> grown in different vineyards of the region, some of them being hundred-year-old, in the provinces of Grosseto, Pisa and Atezzo. All the material was analyzed with I I microsatellite markers (SSR), six of them being those suggested in the frame of the GenRes 08 l European project. The obtained profiles were compared with data collected in our databases and published in literature, confirming that most of the <b>accessions,</b> including <b>registered</b> clones, share the same molecular profile of Tempranillo. Moreover, ampelographic observations and anthocyanins profiles obtained frorn chemical analyses on some grapes and wines were compared. From these results it came up that "Tempranillo" is cultivated in Tuscany in historical vineyards with the synonymous "Malvasia nera"...|$|R
40|$|Starting in 1926 and {{continuing}} for 80 + yr, 11, 241 crop genetic materials have been registered as of 31 Dec. 2008. The crop registration process {{is an important}} pathway to publically describe and document new and useful genetic materials and to incorporate these into the public domain via the National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS). Crop Registration materials are now searchable via the Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN) and demand for registered materials remains strong with more than 9150 <b>registered</b> <b>accessions</b> distributed in the past 26 yr by the NPGS. Guidelines continue to evolve to accommodate global factors effecting germplasm exchange such as Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and international treaties (i. e., The International Treaty on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture). Together with (i) {{the advent of the}} new Journal of Plant Registrations; (ii) the facilitated search capabilities of GRIN; (iii) the development and definition of genetic materials needing registration (cultivars, germplasm, genetic stocks, parental lines, and mapping populations); and (iv) the recognition and allowance of IPR rights: the registration of crops is a healthy viable dynamic registration system {{to meet the needs of}} breeders over the next 80 yr...|$|R
40|$|The seed-specific {{expression}} of recombinant proteins in transgenic plants offers several interesting advantages over other production platforms. The {{aim of this}} study was to select accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana with the highest potential as a platform for seed-specific production of recombinant proteins. A. thaliana was chosen because of its flexibility, high seed yield per m 2, high natural protein content and its non-food status. Seven characteristics were measured for 96 accessions; days to first flower bud, days to complete senescence, rosette size, number of main bolts, dry biomass of plant, seed yield and protein content of seeds. Three characteristics (length of life cycle, seed yield and protein content) were used to select accessions with a maximal yield. A variation of length of life cycle between 87 +/- 11 days (Ler- 1) and more than 200 days (several <b>accessions)</b> was <b>registered.</b> Seed yields per accession varied between 18 +/- 16 mg (Wa- 1) and 274 +/- 76 mg (Mr- 0). Protein content ranged between 30 % (Ws- 2) and 38 % (Cvi- 0). Based on the results of this study, accession Nok- 3 is selected as the accession best suited for exploitation as a seed-based platform for the production of recombinant proteins. Nok- 3 has a high seed yield (194 +/- 66 mg) combined with a moderate protein content of 34. 8 % and short life cycle of 126 +/- 17 days, resulting in a calculated protein yield per year three times higher than reference accession Col- 0. In conclusion, this study illustrates the unexploited variability present in the Arabidopsis gene pool that can be used directly for further optimization of Arabidopsis seeds as production platform. In combination with A. thaliana's rapid life cycle, flexibility, and high fertility, this makes it an attractive platform for the production of specific groups of recombinant proteins, such as high-purity products produced on a relatively small scale...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the extensive and previously underexplored eighteenth-century records of the University Library at St Andrews, demonstrating their considerable potential for enhancing and complicating our existing accounts of book use and reading within eighteenth-century institutions. It uses <b>accessions</b> lists, borrowing <b>registers</b> and surviving books to investigate the far-reaching effects of the 1710 Copyright Act and to trace St Andrews’ readers’ enthusiastic and vociferous engagements with poetry, novels, criticism and plays. Legal deposit under the 1710 Act has often been seen as being relatively ineffectual, but St Andrews’ records provide compelling evidence {{that it had a}} transformative material and intellectual impact on the university, in part through its providing considerable quantities of modern literature. While vernacular literary works were neglected in the English universities, in Scotland in general and in St Andrews in particular they came to play pioneering roles in arts curricula and circulated freely from libraries for formal study and leisurely perusal. St Andrews’ accessions lists record the significant direct and indirect impacts of legal deposit legislation on the composition of the library. A series of slice samples from the borrowing registers shows a narrow canon of exemplary literary writers giving way to more various and heterogeneous patterns of reading in which the novel became increasingly dominant. Finally, a rich vein of surviving eighteenth-century marginalia demonstrates that St Andrews’ students employed literary works as media for contentious, emotional and experimental discourses with each other, with their institution and with the social and affective values of the culture at large...|$|R
