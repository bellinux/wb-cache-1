5|$|Historically, Texas culture {{comes from}} a blend of Southern (Dixie), Western (frontier), and Southwestern (Mexican/Anglo fusion) influences, varying in degrees of such from one intrastate region to another. Texas {{is placed in the}} Southern United States by the United States Census Bureau. A popular food item, the breakfast burrito, draws from all three, having a soft flour tortilla wrapped around bacon <b>and</b> <b>scrambled</b> eggs or other hot, cooked fillings. Adding to Texas's {{traditional}} culture, established in the 18th and 19th centuries, immigration has made Texas a melting pot of cultures from around the world.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its {{period at}} Ubon, No.79 Squadron formed {{part of an}} {{international}} force tasked with defending Thailand's air space against intruders. At {{the start of the}} deployment, tensions in Thailand were such that the squadron's personnel believed that they were at war. While the situation became more stable from late July 1962, No.79 Squadron maintained armed aircraft on alert at all times <b>and</b> <b>scrambled</b> Sabres when unidentified aircraft were detected. No air attacks were conducted against Thailand, however, and the unidentified aircraft that were intercepted almost always proved to be from the Central Intelligence Agency-controlled Air America. In January 1965 two Sabres accidentally overflew North Vietnam after becoming lost during a training sortie but returned safely to Ubon.|$|E
5|$|On {{the ensuing}} kickoff, Egekeze {{attempted}} {{to kick the}} ball as it fell off the tee. This resulted in an unintentional squib that was returned 36yards to the Terps' nine-yard line. Nevada's Kaepernick attempted to rush but was stopped for no gain. On the next play, he threw {{the ball into the}} end zone, but it was intercepted by Maryland safety Kenny Tate, resulting in a touchback. The Terps started on their own 20-yard line, and running back Davin Meggett rushed for 13yards and a first down. Turner then linked up with freshman receiver Ronnie Tyler for another first down at the Maryland 49-yard line. After a false start penalty, the Terps were unable to gain a first down and punted the ball away. The ball rolled into the end zone for a touchback, and Nevada started the final drive of the quarter at its 20-yard line. Kaepernick then passed for two first downs, picked up another due to a pass interference call against Maryland, <b>and</b> <b>scrambled</b> for yet another. He then handed off to Taua, who rushed 17yards for a touchdown. Nevada re-took the lead, 14–13, with 46 seconds remaining in the quarter.|$|E

25|$|The 1973 game {{featured}} Texas and Alabama {{once again}} {{playing in a}} bowl game. Alabama led 13–10 going into the 4th quarter when Texas quarterback, Alan Lowry, ran the bootleg to perfection <b>and</b> <b>scrambled</b> 32 yards for the go-ahead touchdown. Again, Texas defeated Alabama and Bear Bryant, 17–13.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} quarter, Arizona quickly {{drove down the}} field, {{connecting}} on a 47-yard pass from Kurt Warner to Larry Fitzgerald. The drive stalled, however, and they settled for 43-yard Neil Rackers field goal. Tampa bay answered on the ensuing drive. On 3rd and 1, from the 42-yard line, Jeff Garcia fell, but avoided a sack, <b>and</b> <b>scrambled</b> for a first down. Two plays later he scored a 37-yard touchdown pass to Joey Galloway.|$|E
25|$|On February 16, 1862, the Union Army under then Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant {{captured}} Fort Donelson, on the Cumberland River, and Fort Henry, on the Tennessee River, near Dover. With these victories, {{his forces}} took about 12,000 to 15,000 Confederate prisoners. The army was unprepared {{to handle this}} large group of prisoners <b>and</b> <b>scrambled</b> to find places to house them. Colonel Tucker told General Grant's superior, Major General Henry W. Halleck, that Camp Douglas could accommodate 8,000 or 9,000 prisoners, which {{was about the same}} number as the recruits it had been built for. This did not anticipate the differences required of a prison facility.|$|E

25|$|On {{the first}} {{possession}} of the game, Eagles quarterback A. J. Feeley, starting in place of an injured Donovan McNabb, threw an interception to Samuel, who returned it for a touchdown. On the ensuing drive, the Eagles responded with a 14-play drive capped off by a 1-yard touchdown run by Brian Westbrook; thus, before the Patriots offense had its first possession, the game was tied 7–7. On that possession, Brady threw seven passes, was sacked once, <b>and</b> <b>scrambled</b> for 12yards, before Evans had a 1-yard touchdown run (the first called run of the game for the Patriots). The Eagles tied the game again on their next possession when wide receiver Greg Lewis caught a 28-yard touchdown pass from Feeley. After a successful onside kick attempt by the Eagles led to a three-and-out drive, the Patriots started at their own 20-yard line and moved the ball {{all the way to}} the Eagles' 11-yard line before the drive stalled and Gostkowski converted a 23-yard field goal. The Eagles responded with another touchdown pass from Feeley to Lewis, this one from 18yards out, to end a 68-yard drive. With less than 3minutes to go in the first half the Patriots were trailing the Eagles, 21–17. The Patriots then converted three third downs on their last {{possession of the}} half, and Gaffney caught a 19-yard touchdown pass to give the Patriots a halftime lead, 24–21.|$|E
25|$|Li was an {{aggressive}} baseliner whose game was founded upon her quick reflexes, athleticism and powerful groundstrokes that achieved precision, placement and depth. Li's crosscourt forehand {{tended to be}} her favourite shot, hit with great accuracy and pace, although her backhand {{was said to be}} the more consistent and reliable groundstroke, both of which she was known to unleash unpredictably to all areas of the court to dictate play. She boasted an exceptional backhand down-the-line, which was very effective at producing winners or setting up a weak reply from the opponent. Many tennis analysts considered Li one of the cleanest and hardest hitting players on tour, capable of overpowering and outgunning opponents from the baseline. Although she did not possess an overwhelmingly powerful serve, it was very well placed, earning her aces or unreturnables on occasion, however it often became a liability when she lost confidence under pressure, resulting in many double faults. Li employed a solid defensive game combining great footwork, speed and lateral movement. Her ability to turn defense into offense was one of her biggest assets as she hit well on the run <b>and</b> <b>scrambled</b> around the court with ease. Having been an accomplished doubles player, she was comfortable when playing at the net, often moving forward {{to take advantage of a}} short ball or finish off an extended rally. Li's inconsistency was cited as her main weakness throughout her career, as she was prone to streaky and erratic play accompanied by a high unforced error count. Since her shots were usually hit hard and flat with minimal topspin or slice, her game lacked variety. Her emotions on court have hurt her game during tight moments. Under the tutelage of Carlos Rodríguez, Li adopted more of an all-round game, implementing a forehand with additional topspin and frequent net approaches into her arsenal, as well as improved consistency, mental stability, mobility and coordination.|$|E

Newports {{merchant}} seamen loading the guns lost their nerve <b>and</b> <b>scrambled</b> to the ship's port side. One gunner remained at his post, directing bullets at the torpedo; but these were deflected by the water. The torpedo slammed into the ship's engine-room, tearing a gaping hole and knocking the steering gear out of action with an enormous explosion. The helpless ship was yawing out of control across the sixth and seventh columns of the convoy, narrowly missing collisions with other ships, before she lurched round {{in the opposite direction}} to that of the convoy and slowed to a standstill. The surviving ships rolled past her, and the convoy sped on in the fog. Christopher Newport (code-number in the convoy, 'Penway' [...] ) wirelessed the leading ship : 'Hit by aerial torpedo.' The Convoy Commander, Jack Broome, ordered Ledbury, [...] and [...] to '...take all possible action to keep U-boats down.' Ledbury was one of the ships chosen to stay behind to tend to, and if necessary scuttle, the torpedoed ship and they themselves could have been an easy target to any submarines; however, none of the U-boats had maintained contact with the convoy.|$|E
