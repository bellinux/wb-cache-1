5|$|On April10, Colorado State University (CSU) {{issued its}} first {{forecast}} for the season, {{calling for a}} potentially hyperactive season with 18named storms, nine hurricanes, four major hurricanes, and <b>an</b> <b>ACE</b> index of 165. The probabilities of a major hurricane hitting the Gulf Coast and East Coast were well above average. On May15, the United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO) predicted 14named storms, with a 70% chance that the number would be between 10 and 18, and ninehurricanes with a 70% chance that the number would be between 4 and 14. It also predicted <b>an</b> <b>ACE</b> index of 130 with a 70% chance that the index {{would be in the}} range 76 to 184. On May 23, 2013, NOAA issued its first seasonal outlook for the year, stating there was a 70% likelihood of 13 to 20named storms, of which seven to eleven could become hurricanes, including three to six major hurricanes; these ranges are greater than the seasonal average of twelve named storms, six hurricanes and three major hurricanes. On May30, the Florida State University Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies, FSU COAPS, issued its first and only prediction for the season. The organization called for 12 to 17 named storms, of which five to ten would further intensify into hurricanes; no forecast was given for the number of major hurricanes.

40|$|Background : It is {{well-known}} that persistent cervical infections with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) {{are related to}} the development of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive cervical cancer and that infection with HPV 16 and HPV 18 accounts for approximately 70 % of all cases of invasive cervical cancer. Methods : We performed 3 HPV molecular tests&# 8213;the Cobas 4800 HPV test, the Seeplex HPV 4 <b>A</b> <b>ACE,</b> and the hybrid capture 2 (HC 2) test&# 8213;in 146 cervical swab samples to compare between these three tests. Results : There was a concordance rate of 82. 8 % between the results of the Cobas 4800 HPV and the HC 2 test and a concordance rate of 84. 9 % between the results of the Seeplex HPV 4 <b>A</b> <b>ACE</b> and the HC 2 test. Between the Cobas 4800 HPV test and the Seeplex HPV 4 <b>A</b> <b>ACE,</b> there was <b>a</b> concordance rate of 89. 6 % in the detection of high-risk HPV between the results and a concordance rate of 98. 7 % in the detection of HPV 16 or 18. When an abnormal Pap test was defined as &# 8805;low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), the sensitivity of the Cobas 4800 HPV test, the Seeplex HPV 4 <b>A</b> <b>ACE</b> and the HC 2 test were 71. 1 %, 80. 0 %, and 88. 9 %, respectively, while their specificities were 76. 4 %, 74. 5 %, and 67. 9 %, respectively. Conclusions : The {{results of this study suggest}} that the Cobas 4800 HPV test and the Seeplex HPV 4 <b>A</b> <b>ACE</b> may be as effective as the HC 2 test in detecting HR HPV and that the concordance between the results of the Cobas 4800 HPV test and the Seeplex HDV 4 <b>A</b> <b>ACE</b> may be higher in the detection of HPV 16 and HPV 18 than concerning high-risk HPV. </p...|$|R

5|$|Following a {{slightly}} less active June and July than originally anticipated, TWC/WSI downgraded their number of named storms from 20 to 19 on July21, but kept their June numbers of 11 hurricanes and 5 major hurricanes untouched.

That same day, TSR reduced their predictions for their final seasonal outlook, expecting 17.8 named storms, 9.7 hurricanes, 4.5 major hurricanes, and <b>an</b> <b>ACE</b> index of 183 units. On August5, NOAA announced the official development of La Niña {{in their last}} seasonal outlook. The organization lowered the upper bounds of their forecast compared to May due to less early season activity than expected, in all predicting 14 to 20 named storms, 8 to 12 hurricanes, and 4 to 6 major hurricanes. TWC/WSI issued two final forecasts on August25 and September22, both expecting 18 named storms and 10 hurricanes.
