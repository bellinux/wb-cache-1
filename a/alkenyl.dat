25|$|Transition metal {{catalysis}} is {{also useful}} for the stereospecific reduction of <b>alkenyl</b> sulfones. In {{the presence of an}} excess of a Grignard reagent, a palladium(II) or nickel(II) catalyst, and a phosphorus or nitrogen ligand, <b>alkenyl</b> sulfones are converted to the corresponding alkenes stereospecifically in good yield. On the other hand, dissolving metal and metal amalgam reductions are not stereoselective in general. Palladium catalysis is generally superior to nickel catalysis, giving higher yields and stereoselectivities.|$|E
25|$|Using the {{appropriate}} reagent and conditions, alkyl, <b>alkenyl,</b> allylic, and α-keto sulfones {{may be reduced}} in good yield and high stereoselectivity (where applicable). Appropriate conditions for the reduction of these classes of sulfones are discussed below.|$|E
25|$|Titanocene {{equivalents}} {{react with}} <b>alkenyl</b> alkynes followed by carbonylation and hydrolysis to form bicyclic cyclopentadienones, {{related to the}} Pauson–Khand reaction). A similar reaction is the reductive cyclization of enones to form the corresponding alcohol in a stereoselective manner.|$|E
25|$|Reactions of alkenyl- and alkynylaluminium {{compounds}} {{involve the}} transfer of a nucleophilic <b>alkenyl</b> or alkynyl group attached to aluminium to an electrophilic atom. Stereospecific hydroalumination, carboalumination, and terminal alkyne metalation are useful methods for generation of the necessary alkenyl- and alkynylalanes.|$|E
25|$|Alkenyl- and alkynylaluminates {{are most}} {{commonly}} generated through {{the addition of}} n-butyllithium to the alkenylalane. The <b>alkenyl</b> and alkynyl groups, which {{are better able to}} stabilize negative charge, are transferred in preference to the alkyl group. When these intermediates react with alkyl halides, functionalized olefins are produced.|$|E
25|$|Bond length: Hyperconjugation is {{suggested}} {{as a key}} factor in shortening of sigma bonds (σ bonds). For example, the single C–C bonds in 1,3-butadiene and methylacetylene are approximately 1.46 angstrom in length, much less than the value of around 1.54Å found in saturated hydrocarbons. For butadiene, this can be explained as normal conjugation of the two <b>alkenyl</b> parts. But for methylacetylene, hyperconjugation between the alkyl and alkynyl parts.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, N. Miyaura and A. Suzuki {{reported}} {{the synthesis of}} arylated (E)-alkenes in high yield from aryl halides with alkyl-1-enylboranes and catalyzed by tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium and bases. Then A. Suzuki and co-workers extend this kind of reaction to other organoboron compounds and other <b>alkenyl,</b> aryl, alkyl halides and triflate. The palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction organoboron compounds and these organic halides to form carbon-carbon bonds are known as Suzuki–Miyaura Cross-Coupling.|$|E
25|$|Because {{unsaturated}} alanes are oxygen- and moisture-sensitive, {{they are}} most often prepared for immediate use without isolation. However, the method of preparation determines {{the configuration of the}} intermediate unsaturated alane, which {{is directly related to the}} configuration of the product (transfer of the <b>alkenyl</b> group occurs with retention of configuration). Thus, an understanding of available hydroalumination methods is important for the study of reactions of unsaturated alanes. This second describes the most common methods of hydroalumination, and subsequent chemical reactions that the resulting alkenylalanes may undergo.|$|E
25|$|This {{concept has}} been applied to methods for the {{synthesis}} of organic compounds from alkenyl- and alkynylalanes. The most notable applications are methods for the stereospecific synthesis of olefins. Alkenylalanes, which are easily synthesized with complete stereocontrol through alkyne hydroalumination, transfer the <b>alkenyl</b> unit to a variety of electrophiles. Alkynylalanes are less commonly used because alkali metal acetylides can be used for many of the same transformations as alkynylalanes. However, alkynylalanes are useful for the coupling of tertiary halides and alkynes (a reaction difficult to effect with alkali metal alkynes) and for conjugate addition and epoxide opening reactions.|$|E
25|$|Alkyl and <b>alkenyl</b> sulfones {{with good}} leaving {{groups in the}} β {{position}} undergo elimination under reductive conditions to afford alkenes or alkynes. The Julia olefination exploits this process for the synthesis of alkenes from alkyl sulfones and carbonyl compounds. Addition of an α-sulfonyl anion to a carbonyl compound, followed by quenching with an acyl or sulfonyl chloride, leads to a β-acyloxy or -sulfonyloxy sulfone, which undergoes elimination under reductive conditions. Sodium amalgam {{may be used to}} accomplish the elimination step; however, the combination of samarium(II) iodide and HMPA is milder than strongly basic sodium amalgam and leads to higher yields in reductive elimination processes.|$|E
25|$|Transition metal catalyzed hydrovinylation {{is another}} {{important}} alkene synthesis process starting from alkene itself. In general, it involves {{the addition of a}} hydrogen and a vinyl group (or an <b>alkenyl</b> group) across a double bond. The hydrovinylation reaction was first reported by Alderson, Jenner, and Lindsey by using rhodium and ruthenium salts, other metal catalysts commonly employed nowadays included iron, cobalt, nickel, and palladium. The addition can be done highly regio- and stereoselectively, the choices of metal centers, ligands, substrates and counterions often play very important role. Recent studies showed that the use of N-heterocyclic carbene with Ni can be useful for the selective preparations of functionalized geminal olefins or 1,1-disubstituted alkenes.|$|E
25|$|Philodendrons {{can contain}} {{as much as}} 0.7% of oxalates {{in the form of}} calcium oxalate {{crystals}} as raphides. The risk of death, if even possible, is extremely low if ingested by an average adult, although its consumption is generally considered unhealthy. In general, the calcium oxalate crystals have a very mild effect on humans, and large quantities have to be consumed for symptoms to even appear. Possible symptoms include increased salivation, a sensation of burning of the mouth, swelling of the tongue, stomatitis, dysphagia, an inability to speak, and edema. Cases of mild dermatitis due to contact with the leaves have also been reported, with symptoms including vesiculation and erythema. The chemical derivatives of <b>alkenyl</b> resorcinol are believed to be responsible for the dermatitis in some people. Contact with philodendron oils or fluids with the eyes have also been known to result in conjunctivitis. Fatal poisonings are extremely rare; one case of an infant eating small quantities of a philodendron resulting in hospitalization and death has been reported. This one case study, however, was found to be inconsistent with the findings from a second study. In this study, 127 cases of children ingesting philodendrons were studied, and they found only one child showed symptoms; a 10-month-old had minor upper lip swelling when he chewed on a philodendron leaf. The study also found the symptoms could subside without treatment and that previously reported cases of severe complications were exaggerated.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, a pigment {{compound}} {{isolated and}} characterized from fruit bodies of Mycena aurantiomarginata was reported as new to science by Robert Jaeger and Peter Spiteller in the Journal of Natural Products. The chemical, mycenaaurinA, is a polyene compound {{that consists of}} a tridecaketide (i.e., 13 adjacent methylene bridge and carbonyl functional groups with two amino acid [...] on {{either end of the}} molecule). The authors posit that the flanking amino acid groups are probably derived biosynthetically from S-Adenosyl methionine. The tridecaketide itself contains an alpha-pyrone, a conjugated , and a single <b>alkenyl</b> moiety. Jaeger and Spiteller suggest that mycenaaurinA might function as a defense compound, since it exhibits antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus pumilus. The chemical is only present in the fruit bodies, and not in the colorless mycelia. An earlier screening for antimicrobial activity in the fruit bodies revealed a weak ability to inhibit the growth of the fungi Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus.|$|E

2500|$|The use of peroxyacids and {{peroxides}} when {{performing the}} Baeyer–Villiger oxidation {{can cause the}} undesirable oxidation of other functional groups. Alkenes and amines {{are a few of}} the groups that can be oxidized. For instance, alkenes in the substrate, particularly when electron-rich, may be oxidized to epoxides. However, methods have been developed that will allow for the tolerance of these functional groups. In 1962, G. B. Payne reported that the use of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a selenium catalyst will produce the epoxide from <b>alkenyl</b> ketones, while use of peroxyacetic acid will form the ester.|$|E
2500|$|Reactions with alkyl halides and organocopper {{compound}} {{are examples}} of direct displacement mechanism. [...] As in an SN2 reaction, inversion of configuration occurs, as in oxidative dimerization. On the other hand, reactions of organocopper compound with <b>alkenyl</b> halides proceed with retention of subtrate’s configuration. [...] Two possible mechanisms have been considered. In the case of organocopper coupling with aryl halides the reaction proceed via aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction. These reactions are reported to occur with lithium diaryl cuprates with a transmetalation step that forms mixed homocuprate compounds. The composition of this mixture can be generally determined statistically from the amount of substrate that is present before oxidation.|$|E
2500|$|The sulfonyl {{functional}} group (RS(O)2R') {{has become an}} important electron-withdrawing group for modern organic chemistry. α-Sulfonyl carbanions {{may be used as}} nucleophiles in alkylation reactions, Michael-type additions, and other processes. [...] After having served their synthetic purpose, sulfonyl groups are often removed. In the presence of certain reducing agents, one of the sulfur-carbon bonds of the sulfonyl group is cleaved, leading to sulfur-free organic products. Depending {{on the nature of the}} substrate and reaction conditions, alkyl sulfones afford either the corresponding alkanes or olefins (the Julia olefination). Reductive desulfonylation is typically accomplished with active metals or salts (sodium amalgam, aluminium amalgam, magnesium, samarium(II) iodide), tin hydrides (tributyltin hydride), or transition metal complexes with reducing agents or nucleophiles (PdCl2(dppp)/LiHBEt3, Pd(PPh3)4/LiHBEt3, Pd(PPh3)4/NaHC(CO2Et)2). Alkyl, <b>alkenyl,</b> and allylic sulfones may be reduced using one or more of these methods.|$|E
2500|$|To 2.76 g (25.0mmol) of 1-octyne {{was added}} 25.0 mL of a 1.07 M {{solution}} of diisobutylaluminium hydride (26.8mmol) in n-hexane while {{the temperature was}} maintained at 25–30° {{by means of a}} water bath. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes and then was heated at 50° for 4 hours. The resultant alkenylalane was cooled to –30°, diluted with 15 mL of dry ether, and treated with 5.35 g (30.1mmol) of N-bromosuccinimide [...] while keeping the temperature below –15°. The reaction mixture was gradually warmed to room temperature and stirred for 1 hour before being poured slowly into a mixture of 6 N [...] hydrochloric acid (50 mL), n-pentane [...] (10 mL), and ice (10 g). The layers were separated, and the aqueous phase was extracted with pentane. The combined organic extract was washed successively with 1 N [...] sodium hydroxide, 10% sodium sulfite, and saturated aqueous sodium chloride and then was treated with a few crystals of BHT to inhibit isomerization of the <b>alkenyl</b> bromide. After drying over magnesium sulfate, distillation afforded 3.72 g (78%) of (E)-1-bromo-1-octene, bp 67° (5mm), nD26 1.4617. This compound, which contained 4% of 1-bromo-1-octyne, was stored over a few crystals of BHT. 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 0.92 (m, 3 H), 1.1-1.7 (m, 8 H), 1.90-2.34 (m, 2 H), 5.85-6.30 (m, 2 H).|$|E

50|$|The {{stereoselectivity}} of 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions between carbonyl ylide dipoles and <b>alkenyl</b> dipolarophiles {{has also}} been closely examined. For alkynyl dipolarophiles, stereoselectivity {{is not an issue}} as relatively planar sp2 carbons are formed, while regioselectivity must be considered (see image of the Products of the 1,3-Dipolar Cycloaddition Reaction Between Carbonyl Ylide Dipoles and <b>Alkenyl</b> or Alkynyl Dipolarophiles). However, for <b>alkenyl</b> dipolarophiles, both regioselectivity and stereoselectivity must be considered as sp3 carbons are generated in the product species.|$|E

Numerous new classes of <b>alkenyl</b> liquid crystals - designed and patented in our laboratories between 1984 and 1995 - are based on these findings. <b>Alkenyl</b> liquid crystals have become key components for achieving high information content super-twisted nematic (STN)-LCDs and fast responding, thin-film transistor (TFT)-addressed monitor- and television -LCDs.|$|E
