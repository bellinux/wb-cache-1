Gillian had intended it for Audric, but instead {{he gave it to}} Jayce, when Audric was unable to join the League. It seats two, unlike its toy counterpart. <b>Armed</b> <b>Force's</b> toy counterpart included a gimmick dubbed [...] "Stack n' Attack". Any of the other smaller vehicles could detach their wheeled chassis and attach to the top of <b>Armed</b> <b>Force.</b> (A promotional comic in He-Man magazine showed two vehicles stacked atop <b>Armed</b> <b>Force,</b> though this was physically impossible using the toys, as only <b>Armed</b> <b>Force</b> featured two lined up holes suitable for another vehicle's underside to attach into). This never happens in the show; instead, the phrase [...] "stack n' attack" [...] refers to the Lightning League vehicles being able to exchange weapons mid-battle. The pilots are Jayce and Oon, although in [...] "The Vase of Xiang", Flora and Brock drive it as they attempt to rescue Jayce.|$|R
