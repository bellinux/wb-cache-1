He {{had been asked}} by ÖVP Chancellor Julius Raab {{to take over the}} {{movement}} rather than let it be led by a more socialist-leaning group. While the majority of former Nazis had probably joined the two main parties in <b>absolute</b> <b>numbers,</b> they formed a greater percentage of FPÖ members due to the party's small size. Nevertheless, none of them were real revolutionaries and they pursued pragmatic, non-ideological policies. The FPÖ served as a vehicle for them to integrate in the Second Republic; the party was a welcome partner with both the SPÖ and ÖVP in regional and local politics, although it was excluded at the national level. The ÖVP and the FPÖ ran a joint candidate for the 1957 presidential election, who lost.|$|E

Integrating the density over an area also gives us an <b>absolute</b> <b>number</b> of people.

40|$|Introduction: Immunological {{processes}} {{are most important}} in recurrent spontaneous abortion(RSA). According to studies T lymphocytes and natural killer cells(NK cells) are two effective cell groups in RSA. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the percentage and <b>absolute</b> <b>number</b> of natural killer(NK) cells in women with RSA with unknown etiology. Methods: 24 Women with a history of recurrent pregnancy losses with unknown etiology. We compared the percentage of peripheral blood NK cells with a group of fertile patients. Lymphocytes from peripheral blood were isolated by ficoll paque density centrifugation. Lymphocytes were stained using anti CD 56 and(FITC) -anti CD 16 and CYQ-CD 3 monoclonal antibodies for identification of NK cells and was used anti CD 56 and(FITC) -anti CD 69 for detection of activated NK cells. We used BD FACS calibure flow cytometry for data analysis. Results: On the basis of the obtained results, <b>absolute</b> <b>number</b> of CD 16 + 56 + cells showed significant increases in Recurrent spontaneous abortion(RSA) in comparison with control group(P= 0. 43). Also <b>absolute</b> <b>number</b> of CD 16 + 56 bright cells had significant increase in RSA(P= 0. 00). There was no significant difference(P= 0. 08) of CD 16 + 56 dim cells between RSA and control group. In RSA, the <b>absolute</b> <b>number</b> of CD 69 +cells significantly increased(P= 0. 02). Also, results showed significant increase in the <b>absolute</b> <b>number</b> of CD 56 +/CD 69 + cells in RSA(P= 0. 04). Conclusion: The results suggested that the higher percentage of NK cells in peripheral blood of RSA patients compared to control group may indicate the same increase in number and cytotoxicity of uterin NK cells...|$|R
40|$|Phenotype and proliferative {{ability of}} {{peripheral}} blood lymphocytes from 15 noninstitutionalized children affected with Down Syndrome (DS), in apparently good health, were studied and {{compared with those}} of 16 healthy control children of the same age. A complex derangement of all the major peripheral blood cell subsets, i. e., B cells, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, was present in DS children. A significant decrease of the <b>absolute</b> <b>number</b> of circulating lymphocytes, a marked and significant decrease of B lymphocytes, a marked and significant decrease of B lymphocyte <b>absolute</b> <b>number</b> and percentage, and dramatic modifications of the T-cell subsets were observed. The <b>absolute</b> <b>number</b> of CD 4 + cells was significantly decreased, whereas CD 8 + cells increased significantly in percentage but not in <b>absolute</b> <b>number.</b> A derangement of cells bearing markers associated with NK activity, such as CD 57, CD 16, and CD 56, was observed. Among the most important alterations, the presence of a high number of CD 57 +, CD 16 - cells, of CD 57 +, CD 8 + lymphocytes, and of CD 3 +, CD 56 + lymphocytes was seen. Many of these alterations are similar to those characteristic of chromosomally normal subjects of advanced age. The hypothesis that the reduced thymic endocrine activity and the zinc deficiency characteristic of DS are responsible for the derangement of T and NK subsets is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of action of interferon-alpha (IFN-A) in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is not known, but some evidence points at the immune modulation properties of IFN-A. We conducted a prospective analysis on 49 patients with CML in chronic phase treated with IFN-A {{in order to identify}} the effect of therapy on different lymphocyte subpopulations as determined by flow cytometric quantification and whether this effect is associated with the response to IFN-A. The <b>absolute</b> <b>number</b> of lymphocytes was similar in all patients regardless of response to IFN-A. In patients achieving a complete cytogenetic response (CCGR) there was a rebound of the absolute count of CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 8 +, and CD 19 + lymphocytes after discontinuation of therapy with IFN-A. Patients with resistant disease, as well as patients with hematologic response but no cytogenetic response, showed a lower <b>absolute</b> <b>number</b> of CD 19 + cells than patients with any cytogenetic response. Patients who achieved a CCGR had a higher <b>absolute</b> <b>number</b> of CD 56 + cells than patients with lesser response or no response to IFN-A, and this persisted after discontinuation of therapy. We conclude that an increase in <b>absolute</b> <b>number</b> of CD 19 + and CD 56 + lymphocytes is observed in CML patients achieving a CCGR with IFN-A compared to patients with lesser responses. These changes could have functional consequences in the control of the disease...|$|R
