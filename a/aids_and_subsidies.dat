It was to be the defining act of King Faisal's career, and gained him lasting prestige among many Arabs and Muslims worldwide.

Behind the practice lies the theory, which over the last fifty years has been dominated by neo-classical economics. Markets are seen as the most efficient method of allocating resources, although sometimes they fail, and regulation becomes necessary to protect the ideal market model. Behind the theory lies the history, reaching back further than the Roman Empire. The business practices of market traders, guilds and governments have always been subject to scrutiny and sometimes severe sanctions. Since the twentieth century, competition law has become global. The two largest, most organised and influential systems of competition regulation are United States antitrust law and European Community competition law. The respective national authorities, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the United States and the European Commission's Competition Directorate General (DGCOMP) have formed international support and enforcement networks. Competition law is growing in importance every day, which warrants for its careful study.|$|E

The {{study examines}} the industrial policy in Britain, France, Germany {{and in the}} European Union, and this policy’s capacity to shape industrial outcomes and structures. It analyses {{the political and economic}} considerations which affect the industrial policymaking procedures. I argue that the discussion on industrial policy is still too strongly influenced by the debates of free trade and interventionism This overlooks two facts: governments have always played an influential role in industrial affairs and thus, all the activities which are made to shape industrial outcomes are political as much as economic. This argument is backed up by focusing on state and economy linkages where state <b>aids</b> <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> constitute the most influential tool in economic and industrial policy-making. Also the descriptive parts on industrialization in selected European Union helps to give on historical depth to the argument. Against this background, the study traces the European Union’s industrial policy from the Treaty of Paris in 1951 to the adaptation of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. It concludes that today, the Community policy remains to be uncoordinated and underdeveloped. I'his does not constitute a clear and consistent framework for the European industry. The study suggests that industrial policy should be developed and implemented as a coherent framework with a liberal and competitive approach. Thus, Europe can face the world markets and become a global player. Sepici, YeşimM. S...|$|E

40|$|Coupled {{social and}} {{ecological}} systems {{need to be}} understood from a dynamic perspective in order to operationalise complexity concepts, such as tipping points, for sustainable ecosystem management. In this study, we strive to achieve this type of conceptual understanding through {{the analysis of the}} relationships (e. g. strength, nonlinearity) between the trends of ecosystem services (ES) and human wellbeing (HWB) between 1960 and 2010 in the south-west Bangladesh delta using generalized additive and logistic regression models. We use sequential principal components analysis to investigate the connectedness within the social–ecological system as a measure of resilience. We also use published literature to help develop a system dynamic framework in order to investigate how ES and HWB are interlinked. Overall, our results support previous work, which depicts that material wellbeing (basic materials for a good life) having a strong relationship with provisioning services, which in turn, show a weak relationship with the quality of life (security and health). Moreover, our analysis confirms the ‘Environmentalist’s Paradox’ that HWB has increased despite the deterioration in ES. However, our results suggest that provisioning services are not the only important reason for the increases in observed HWB, as these have also been substantially influenced by technology <b>and</b> capital investment (<b>aid</b> <b>and</b> <b>subsidy).</b> In addition, worsening trends in regulation services and in ‘slow’ variables such as climate suggest that the resilience of the overall social-ecological system is decreasing. Such changes may have severe consequences if they continue, for example, if temperatures exceed the upper physiological limits of key provisioning services (e. g. rice, fish) in the Bangladesh delta. These indicators all suggest that although in terms of HWB the deltaic social–ecological system may be successfully adapting to environmental change, it may also be close to transgressing critical ecological boundaries in the near future...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent decades}} civilized {{society in the}} general line of welfare {{included}} low rent housing. Public housing {{is one of the}} social actions necessary for the attainment of material requisites of well-being because individual actions in the ordinary business of life will not satisfy the needs of men in this direction. Although some strides have been made along these lines, our nation-wide housing predicament is still among the domestic problems most in need of our immediate attention. We must face the fact that our metropolitan areas, in which more than 90 percent of our population will soon be living, are today in an acutely dangerous financial position. The exodus from our urban centers of the upper middle-income class and professional groups has resulted in a loss, for the cities, of taxable income. The urban movement of great numbers of large-sized, low-income families has, at the same time, resulted in the social as well as the economic cost of overcrowding, undermaintenance and inadequate city services. These long-term population trends pose financial problems to city and suburban areas. We have made only minor efforts to solve them. The solution of our difficulties seems more remote when one considers that the annual subsidy to potato growers alone is larger than all federal contributions to urban renewal. It may cost the federal government five billion dollars a year for the next ten years to support a nation-wide program for developing and renewing our cities, towns and suburbs. If so, this will amount to less than 7 percent of the total budget. It will be no more than the cost of current <b>aids</b> <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> to agriculture which benefit directly one-tenth of our population. Today, four-fifths of all American families live in cities or in the suburbs which surround them.

40|$|Purpose of the article: The {{small and}} medium {{enterprises}} (SMEs) {{are very important}} part of the Czech economy, the situation of SMEs is currently more difficult because of the economical crisis, therefore the increased attention is drawn to them. The paper is focused on the internationalization of SMEs, especially on identifying key success factors of small and medium-sized companies that do business in engineering industry. Scientific aim: The authors focused on the specification of the most important aspects of the internationalization of Czech engineering small and medium enterprises. Methodology/methods: Authors realized due to several years survey among various small and medium sized enterprises, that the internationalization process of SMEs in different fields have different characteristics, therefore, attention was particularly stiff in engineering. Based on a survey of engineering SMEs operating in foreign markets the authors tried to determine what is typical for a successful company, what are their common features and what could be generalized and recommend to other small and medium-sized enterprises. Findings: It was found that the most successful SMEs chose a direct export as an ideal form of entry into foreign markets. Furthermore, it was found that one of the key success factors of SMEs in the foreign market is the ability to adapt to foreign market, especially on price and product. From long-term perspective are the most successful small and medium engineering businesses, which maintain its market share through pricing policy tools. Conclusions: Based on a survey among SMEs, which operate in foreign markets, the finds examined whether firms that are successful on foreign markets, have some common features that could be generalized as determinants of success of the internationalization process in the engineering industry. Most of the SMEs, which in foreign markets successfully operating, there are a limited liability company, which as a form of entry into foreign markets have chosen direct exports.

40|$|In high-income nations, {{the concept}} of PES has gained {{traction}} largely because it complements ongoing efforts to redirect agricultural subsidies toward public goods through conservation payment schemes. In low- and middle-income nations, PES has become popular for 4 reasons (Pattanayak et al. 2010). First, weak institutions render regulations, indirect development strategies, and incentive-based quantity strategies (e. g., tradable development rights) difficult. Second, governments prefer subsidies to achieve policy objectives and are increasingly receptive to applying conditionality and performance metrics {{in the distribution of}} <b>aid</b> <b>and</b> <b>subsidies.</b> Third, policy makers, practitioners, and donors believe PES can achieve both poverty alleviation and ecosystem protection. Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, practitioners <b>and</b> international <b>aid</b> donors believe PES programs can become self-financing with short-term investments in PES start-up costs and ecosystem valuation (how the public-good nature of the services can be resolved by these investments has not been explained clearly). In other words, PES is perceived as more than just a tool for conservation investment. It is also perceived as a tool for conservation financing. Unfortunately, the reasons that motivate the global popularity of PES also constrain its effectiveness in achieving environmental and social objectives. I describe what is known about the environmental and social effects of PES and I outline new directions for PES research. I emphasize two points. First, greater use of PES is unwarranted unless new or expanded systems are designed explicitly to measure PES's environmental and social effects and to explore competing notions of effective contract design. Second, efforts to value ecosystem services separate from policies designed to deliver them are wasted. Estimates of the benefits of ecosystem services have no policy relevance unless they are estimated in the context of real conservation effects from real conservation programs...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{draws on}} a {{fieldwork}} carried out during spring 2010 with internally displaced {{people living in}} Medellín’s poor quarters, who have fled from the Colombian conflict that has ravaged the countryside for decades. The thesis explores how the internally displaced re-establish {{their lives in the}} aftermath of the expulsion from the rural areas in Antioquia and Chocó. The establishment in the city involves multiple processes in which they reconstruct livelihoods, reconfigure citizenship and rebuild places. The processes are mediated by mechanisms of power relations between the displaced people, the state and the host community. The thesis shows that the most important factor in one’s economical and development strategies is not the governmental <b>aid</b> <b>and</b> <b>subsidies,</b> but the inter-household transfers and maintenance of social ties with others. Without denying that the internally displaced people are subordinated to certain power relations, the thesis acknowledges that they cannot simply be seen as victims of forces that are beyond their control. The internally displaced people are restrained by existing structures of power, but these structures also leave them in a space of action within which they are competent social agents capable of influencing their own lives. The process of establishment in the harsh environment brings forth acts of creativity from the displaced population. The displacement implies not only a change of ‘territorial’ place but also a change of ‘social’ place. When they arrive in the city, they enter what may be seen as a void, excluded from the urban community. Focusing on the interaction between the internally displaced people and representatives from organizations and institutions associated with the state, the thesis seeks to analyze how the internally displaced people experience citizenship through the process of registering in the official register for internally displaced people (RUPD). In accordance with a growing body of literature from social sciences, I argue that citizenship cannot only be viewed as a legal status guaranteeing citizens equal positions in the society. Citizenship is more fruitfully understood as something that is produced and reproduced through social practice. Acknowledging this enables one to see that in practice there are several citizenships which are hierarchically structured...|$|R

Our estimates include schools that are not currently eligible to participate in federal student aid programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act and are therefore missed in official counts.

Many for-profit institutions that are not Title IV eligible offer certificate (non-degree) programs that are similar, if not identical, to those given by institutions that are Title IV eligible. We find that the Title IV institutions charge tuition that is about 78 percent higher than that charged by comparable institutions whose students cannot apply for federal financial aid. The dollar value of the premium is about equal to the amount of grant <b>aid</b> <b>and</b> loan <b>subsidy</b> received by students in eligible institutions, lending some credence to a variant of the “Bennett hypothesis” that aid-eligible for-profit institutions capture a large part of the federal student aid subsidy. ...|$|R

40|$|Can {{climate and}} {{development}} issues be tackled through partnerships? In {{view of the}} very limited number of multi-stakeholder partnerships for climate change in general, and those focused on development (developing countries) in particular, it seems useful {{to take a step}} back and consider the linkages between climate and development in a bit more detail. Also: what are the finance perspectives on climate change? And how do farmers look at the topic? Is there a trade-off between fairtrade and climate change? The fifth Max Havelaar Lecture considers these tensions. Position paper written by Ans Kolk and Jonathan Pinkse. Poverty alleviation constitutes a multi-faceted problem. It is on the one hand extremely local and leads to enormous deprivation of at least half of the world’s population. But on the other hand, it is an extremely international problem as well through the operation of global markets – in particular of resources – and the functioning of value chains. It has increasingly become acknowledged that the role of corporations and the private sector is vital for sustainable solutions to poverty. Entrepreneurial solutions are often considered preferable to the traditional approach of development <b>aid</b> <b>and</b> <b>subsidies.</b> Micro-credits <b>and</b> fair trade labels are typical examples of this new development paradigm. At the same time, however, it is clear that the involvement of private (international) corporations is far from undisputed. The claim that the profit maximisation strategies of private corporations can ‘solve’ poverty requires substantial modifications. It is obvious that some strategies are more effective than others. The integration of developing countries in the international supply chains of multinational corporations can have positive and negative repercussions. The new development paradigm therefore is not yet established, let alone undisputed. The Max Havelaar lecture stimulates the thinking on these issues in a balanced manner, without making use of the usual simplifications either in support of or against the involvement of firms in development. The Max Havelaar organisation is proof of this approach: it is aiming at a continuous improvement in its strategy towards labeling products – increasingly in a variety of partnerships with NGOs, corporations and governments. The Max Havelaar lecture has seven aims: - Provide a platform for the presentation of state-of-the-art scientific insights into how sustainable business and development cooperation can be combined - Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the involvement of corporations in poverty alleviation in a systematic and non-ideological manner - Address the complexities of sustainable development rather than engage in simplifications on poverty, in order to come up with realistic – and obtainable – approaches to address in particular poverty (Millennium Development Goal 1) - Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of specific approaches such as trade marks, codes of conduct, reporting or governance measures - Provide an arena in which innovative ideas can be launched - Consider development as part of international value chains in which a fair distribution of income, power and knowledge is an issue that affects both developed and developing economies - Start a structured dialogue on shaping the preconditions for effective partnerships between public and private parties (including firms and NGOs) for development (Millenium Development Goal 8...|$|R

In this study a formulated mathematical problem for the olive oil sector on the island of Crete based on the welfare concept and the simulation of the olive oil market equilibrium, subject to specified policy interventions and circumstances was adopted. According to the results obtained, it was concluded that future olive oil policies should not impinge on mechanisms that influence olive oil farmers and consumer behaviour but should emphasize the greater cost effectiveness of production and marketing policies...|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} Sempringham Priory in the 15th century is very obscure. In 1400, a papal indulgence was granted for the repair of the priory church and, in 1409, a legacy was {{left for the}} fabric of the bell tower. In 1445, Henry VI granted to Nicholas Resby, master of the order, that the houses of Sempringham, Haverholme, Catley, Bullington, Sixhills, North Ormsby, and Alvingham should be free and exempt from all <b>aids,</b> <b>subsidies,</b> <b>and</b> tallages, and should never {{contribute}} to any payments of tenths or fifteenths made by the whole body of the clergy or of the provinces of Canterbury and York separately. However, the prior and convent of Sempringham were compelled to pay £40 in 1522 as their share of a grant from the spirituality towards Henry VIII's personal expenses in France for the recovery of that crown. With the abandonment of farming, except on the immediate demesne, the need of the order for lay brothers disappeared. They probably died out altogether early in the 15th century, and there is no record of any at the dissolution. Servants, too, probably very largely took the place of the lay sisters.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In {{developing}} countries, {{user fees}} may represent {{an important source}} of revenues for private-non-for-profit hospitals, but they may also affect access, use and equity. Methods This survey was conducted in ten hospitals of the Uganda Catholic Medical Bureau to assess differences in user fees policies and to propose changes that would better fit with the social concern explicitly pursued by the Bureau. Through a review of relevant hospital documents and reports, and through interviews with key informants, health workers and users, hospital and non-hospital cost was calculated, as well as overall expenditure and revenues. Lower fees were applied in some pilot hospitals after the survey. Results The percentage of revenues from user fees varied between 6 % and 89 % (average 40 %). Some hospitals were more successful than others in getting external <b>aid</b> <b>and</b> government <b>subsidies.</b> These hospitals were applying lower fees and flat rates, and were offering free essential services to encourage access, as opposed to the fee-for-service policies implemented in less successful hospitals. The wide variation in user fees among hospitals was not justified by differences in case mix. None of the hospitals had a policy for exemption of the poor; the few users that actually got exempted were not really poor. To pay hospital and non-hospital expenses, about one third of users had to borrow money or sell goods and property. The fee system applied after the survey, based on flat and lower rates, brought about an increase in access and use of hospital services. Conclusion Our results confirm that user fees represent an unfair mechanism of financing for health services because they exclude the poor and the sick. To mitigate this effect, flat rates and lower fees for the most vulnerable users were introduced to replace the fee-for-service system in some hospitals after the survey. The results are encouraging: hospital use, especially for pregnancy, childbirth and childhood illness, increased immediately, with no detrimental effect on overall revenues. A more equitable user fees system is possible. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} misrepresentation and cheating {{into the}} policy analysis of output quotas <b>and</b> <b>subsidies.</b> Analytical {{results show that}} when cheating occurs output quotas are a less efficient means of income redistribution than is traditionally believed. As well, cheating increases the transfer efficiency of output subsidies. The result is that an all-or-nothing choice between quotas <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> will generally favor the use of subsidies. A combination of quotas <b>and</b> <b>subsidies,</b> however, usually remains the most efficient means of income redistribution through market intervention.
