5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} form along linear {{bands of}} temperature/dewpoint gradient with significant vertical wind shear, {{and are thus}} classified as baroclinic cyclones. Initially, cyclogenesis, or low pressure formation, occurs along frontal zones near a favorable quadrant of a maximum in the upper level jetstream known as a jet streak. The favorable quadrants are usually at the right rear and left front quadrants, where divergence ensues. The divergence causes air to rush out {{from the top of}} the air column. As mass in the column is reduced, atmospheric pressure at surface level (the weight of the air column) is reduced. The lowered pressure strengthens the cyclone (a low pressure system). The lowered pressure acts to draw in air, creating convergence in the low-level wind field. Low-level convergence and upper-level divergence imply upward motion within the column, making cyclones tend to be cloudy. As the cyclone strengthens, the cold front sweeps towards the equator and moves <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cyclone. Meanwhile, its associated warm front progresses more slowly, as the cooler air ahead of the system is denser, and therefore more difficult to dislodge. Later, the cyclones occlude as the poleward portion of the cold front overtakes a section of the warm front, forcing a tongue, or trowal, of warm air aloft. Eventually, the cyclone will become barotropically cold and begin to weaken.|$|E

25|$|The strap can be {{adjusted}} to suit the diver's head. Too loose may not provide an effective seal and the mask may dislodge easily, and too tight may result in discomfort or pain. Correct positioning of the strap <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head will {{reduce the risk of}} dislodging and facilitate clearing.|$|E

25|$|Women's field {{players are}} not {{required}} to wear protective equipment besides eyegear. Eyegear is a metal cage covering the eyes attached with a strap <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head. In recent years, there has been discussion about allowing or requiring padded headgear to protect against concussions. Women goalies wear a helmet, gloves, and chest protector.|$|E
25|$|Lapels are {{the folded}} flaps of cloth {{on the front}} of a jacket or coat, and are most {{commonly}} found on formal clothing and suit jackets. Usually they are formed by folding over the front edges of the jacket or coat and sewing them to the collar, an extra piece of fabric <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neck.|$|E

25|$|The P-47D-1 through P-47D-6, the P-47D-10, and the P-47D-11 {{successively}} incorporated {{changes such as}} {{the addition}} of more engine cooling flaps <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cowl to reduce the engine overheating problems that had {{been seen in the}} field. Engines and engine subsystems saw refinement, (the P-47D-10 introduced the R-2800-63, replacing the R-2800-21 seen in previous P-47s) as did the fuel, oil and hydraulic systems. Additional armor protection was also added for the pilot.|$|E
25|$|The Tabriz loom, {{named after}} the city of Tabriz, is used in Northwestern Iran. The warps are {{continuous}} and pass around behind the loom. Warp tension is obtained with wedges. The weavers sit on a fixed seat and when {{a portion of the}} carpet has been completed, the tension is released and the carpet is pulled down and rolled <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loom. This process continues until the rug is completed, when the warps are severed and the carpet is taken off the loom.|$|E
25|$|Each {{participating}} broadcaster nominates a Head of Delegation, {{whose job}} it is to co-ordinate the movements of the delegate members, and who acts as that country's representative to the EBU in the host city. Members of the delegations include performers, lyricists, composers, official press officers and—in the years where songs were performed with a live orchestra—a conductor. Also present if desired is a commentator: each broadcaster may supply their own commentary for their TV and/or radio feed, to be broadcast in each country. The commentators are given dedicated commentary booths situated <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arena behind the audience.|$|E

25|$|There {{will also}} be {{extensive}} landscaping works around the station. The southern entrance at Station Street will form the main drop-off area for cars and taxis, allowing the existing drop-off area to be enclosed within the concourse. There are six voids above the railway tracks, and so {{as part of the}} proposals, the void adjacent to Queens Drive, to the east of the station, will be covered to create a new public square. A new walkway will be created from the Queens Drive entrance along the largest eastern void, <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Odeon cinema to the Bull Ring. This will give visitors a direct and signed link to Birmingham Moor Street railway station. Most of the parapet walls to the voids will be redecorated with new cladding or art features, with the exception of those adjacent to the Signal Box which can only be cleaned.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} is {{situated at the}} back of the Saw Plaza. The exterior queue line consists of mock razor wire fences and various large torture implements rusting on the ground (most of which come from the films). Walkie talkie announcements are heard from policemen inside the building, often sounding as if they are panicking. Loud ambient music is played throughout the area. The queue travels <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> warehouse and then into the building itself. Inside, riders walk through a dimly lit corridor, with four shotguns hanging from the ceiling. The guns 'fire' every few minutes to give a jump effect. The corridor leads up some stairs past a cage with a trap (the Rack from Saw III) seen in it. On special occasions, live actors are placed in this cage and act as Jigsaw's victims. Travelling up the stairs, Billy the Puppet can be seen and heard on TV monitors up the stairs to the station. Above the queue, a body is seen tangled in barbed wire (referencing the first Saw), before the queue goes into the station. In here, mannequin parts are fixed in various small devices or hanging from the walls, and misted windows flash on the wall opposite the queue.|$|E
25|$|On another note several {{athletic}} {{facilities are}} being renovated, {{and the new}} $8 million academic center will be located beneath the Norton Terrace {{at the south end}} of Papa John's Cardinal Stadium. It will be centrally located between two of the university's cornerstone buildings, the Swain Student Activities Center and Papa John's Cardinal Stadium. It will have seating capacity for over 5,300 fans and will feature a 15,500 square foot training center that will include identical locker rooms for each team, coaches' offices and a sports medicine training room. This stadium will be the second largest project the athletic department has undertaken behind Papa John's Cardinal Stadium. Furthermore, a $4 million expansion of Jim Patterson Stadium includes the addition of 1,500 chair back seats, two-tiered ground level terraces, a visiting team locker room, and a 6,400 square foot terrace atop the chair back seats connecting the first and third base sides. The new Jim Patterson Stadium will have a total capacity of 5,000. Along with the $2.75 million expansion of U of L's softball stadium will feature a team clubhouse with a locker room, a video room, and a players' lounge. The Dan Ulmer Stadium will see the addition of 200 chair back seats, bringing the seating capacity to 1,000. The project also will add a 2,380 square foot fan terrace wrapping <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stadium, as well as a new press box that will more than double its current size.|$|E

500|$|In mid-2006, Bloc Party {{travelled}} to Lee's Grouse Lodge Studios in Westmeath, Ireland, {{to record}} A Weekend in the City. The band members initially worked by experimenting with their respective instruments and sound check arrangements. Moakes additionally focused on using {{different types of}} synthesiser. All parties soon moved to the main recording room, a large area with [...] "a lot of natural ambience" [...] according to sound engineer Tom McFall. A makeshift booth was built <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drum kit to reduce any sonic interference, while a roof was sometimes used over drummer Matt Tong to isolate a pure sound. Different types of microphones were used for each component of the drum kit. The miking scheme was crucial to prepare the drum tracks for the looping and processing Lee planned using production program Logic.|$|E

2500|$|Modern {{dry suits}} have a {{watertight}} zipper for entry and exit. The original bronze-toothed version {{was developed by}} NASA to hold air inside space suits. This complex and special zipper {{is one of the}} most expensive parts of the suit. Heavy duty. medium and lightweight versions are made. A later design uses injection moulded plastic teeth, and these are lighter, more flexible and less costly. The zipper is commonly installed across the back of the shoulders, since this placement compromises overall flexibility the least — but this design normally means the wearer requires assistance to close and open the zipper. The other common zipper placement is diagonally across the torso, which allows self-donning. Other designs place the zipper straight down the middle of the back (early Poseidon Unisuit), Up one side of the front, <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neck and partway back down the front (later model Poseidon Unisuit) or on a wide tubular chest entry opening which is folded down and clipped round the waist after sealing the zip (some Typhoon suits). The waterproof-zipper is stiff, and cannot stretch at all, which can make it difficult for a user to get into and out of the suit. Dry suits may also be fitted with an extra waterproof [...] "fly", [...] "relief" [...] or [...] "convenience" [...] zipper to let the user urinate when out of the water when the suit is worn for long periods.|$|E
