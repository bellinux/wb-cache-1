5|$|Just {{before the}} Japanese {{surrender}} {{that ended the}} war, News-Miner editor David Tewkesbury died. He was replaced by Art Bremer, a reporter. The post-war boom caused a sudden shortage of newsprint, as paper mills {{were not able to}} meet the demand {{of a growing number of}} newspapers nationwide. This shortage caused the News-Miner to run short until Lathrop used his industrial connections to divert a shipment from <b>a</b> <b>newspaper</b> <b>that</b> was going out of business.|$|E
5|$|The 1896 {{establishment}} of the Gympie Truth, <b>a</b> <b>newspaper</b> <b>that</b> he was to partly own, {{was part of his}} response. Intended as a medium to broadcast Labour's message, the newspaper played a vital role in Fisher's return to parliament in 1899. This time, he was the beneficiary of a scare campaign, in which conservative candidate Francis Power was consistently painted by the Gympie Truth as being a supporter of black labour and the alleged economic and social ills that accompanied it. In that year he was Secretary for Railways and Public Works in the seven-day government of Anderson Dawson, the first parliamentary Labour government in the world.|$|E

5|$|Witnesses near King at {{the moment}} of his death said that the shot came from another location. They said that it came from behind thick {{shrubbery}} near the boarding house—which had been cut away in the days following the assassination—and not from the boarding house window. However, Ray's fingerprints were found on various objects (a rifle, a pair of binoculars, articles of clothing, <b>a</b> <b>newspaper)</b> <b>that</b> were left in the bathroom where it was determined the gunfire came from. An examination of the rifle containing Ray's fingerprints also determined that at least one shot was fired from the firearm {{at the time of the}} assassination.|$|E
5|$|On Monday 4 February, William {{bought some}} rope {{at the local}} grocer's shop, and {{spent the rest of}} the day observing cases at the Sheriff Court from the public gallery. He was later {{reported}} to have listened attentively to the proceedings. On 7 February, he attended the court sessions again. On 10 February, he visited his acquaintance, Walker, who lent him <b>a</b> <b>newspaper</b> <b>that</b> featured a woman's suicide by hanging. Walker asked Bury to look up any news of Jack the Ripper, at which Bury threw down the newspaper with a fright. That evening, he walked into the Dundee Central Police Station on Bell Street and reported his wife's suicide to Lieutenant James Parr. He said they had been drinking heavily the night before her death, and he had woken in the morning to find his wife's body on the floor with a rope around her neck. Bury had not summoned a doctor, but had instead cut the body and concealed it in one of the packing cases brought from London. Bury told Parr that his actions were now preying on his mind, and he was afraid that he would be arrested and accused of being Jack the Ripper.|$|E

25|$|Under the Palo Alto Daily News model, {{papers are}} {{delivered}} to public {{places such as}} coffee shops, restaurants, stores, gyms, schools, corporate campuses, and news racks.

While ads can be placed on Web pages, they are not as effective for clients as print advertising. They have said that if they ever find an example of <b>a</b> <b>newspaper</b> <b>that</b> is making a profit on its website, they would copy that approach.|$|E
25|$|The Union of Democratic Control {{became the}} most {{important}} of all the anti-war organisations in Britain, with membership reaching 650,000 by 1917. His political courage was praised by people such as Bertrand Russell and the writer Romain Rolland, but his leading role in the pacifist movement exposed him to violent attacks led by the pro-war press. He was pictured as an agent of Germany in the Daily Express, <b>a</b> <b>newspaper</b> <b>that</b> also listed details of future UDC meetings and encouraged its readers to attend and break them up. The accusation gained some credibility when Roger Casement, who was known as a friend and supporter of Morel, was hanged for treason (he had contacted the Germans seeking support for Irish nationalism). Morel was even the victim of occasional physical assaults.|$|E
25|$|When he was four, Twain's {{family moved}} to Hannibal, Missouri, a port town on the Mississippi River that {{inspired}} the fictional town of St.Petersburg in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.

In 1851 he began working as a typesetter, contributing articles and humorous sketches to the Hannibal Journal, <b>a</b> <b>newspaper</b> <b>that</b> Orion owned.
