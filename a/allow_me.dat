5|$|<b>Allow</b> <b>Me,</b> {{also known}} as Umbrella Man, is an iconic 1983 bronze {{sculpture}} by John Seward Johnson II, located in Pioneer Courthouse Square in Portland, Oregon, United States. The sculpture, one of seven <b>Allow</b> <b>Me</b> casts, was donated anonymously to the City of Portland in 1984 for display in the Square. It depicts a life-sized man dressed in a business suit, hailing a cab and holding an umbrella. Constructed from bronze, aluminum and stainless steel, the sculpture stands six feet, ten inches tall and weighs 460 pounds. The sculpture {{is one of many}} works of art generated by the city's Percent for Art program, and is considered part of the City of Portland and Multnomah County Public Art Collection courtesy of the Regional Arts & Culture Council.|$|E
5|$|In July 1995, the {{sculpture}} {{was removed from}} its pedestal and shipped to Stellar Artworks in Van Nuys, California for cleaning and restoration. It received a glassbead peening to remove the effects of birds, human hands, pollution and precipitation, plus a coat of incralac, a lacquer-based acrylic resin coating. The restoration was funded by an anonymous donor and involved Art Work Fine Art Services, Industrial Craters & Packers, O'Neill Transfer Co., Smith Masonry Contractors and the Regional Arts & Culture Council. This marked {{the sculpture}}'s first restoration since 1985. <b>Allow</b> <b>Me</b> receives cold wax coatings each year to maintain its shine.|$|E

25|$|I {{think every}} {{director}} {{thinks that he}} hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.|$|E
25|$|You write: „I came to {{liberate}} the Talysh Khanate {{from the hands of}} the Persians“, <b>allow</b> <b>me,</b> general, not to believe your lying words, for you, I will say frankly and directly, as you came here to enslave and oppress the Talysh people. While Mir Mustafa Khan is alive, your government will have to protect the Khan his rights, by treating him personally and with due care; but once he will die his heirs will lose its independence and autonomy, turning in speechless and unfortunate slaves, the fault of the mad and visionary would degenerate Mir Mustafa Khan, the same who pursue only their personal goals in order to meet their lust for power, being a heartless and hardened egoist, as they're not thinking about the sad and desolate future of their offspring, who will betray him to anathema, because they will invite you here and handing the fate of their homeland to unfaithful strangers — rapists turning his people into meaningless plebeians. The groans and screams of the dead people involved in this network of selfish schemer — Mir Mustafa Khan will form an eternal curse upon it, as long as the Talysh Mountains stand firm, the bitter mourning the unfortunate fate of the Talysh people.|$|E

500|$|The Portland {{sculpture}} is one {{of seven}} casts of John Seward Johnson II's <b>Allow</b> <b>Me.</b> It was designed and completed by Johnson in 1983 and is constructed from bronze, aluminum and stainless steel. In 1984, the sculpture was donated anonymously, but {{in the name of}} Harry H. Schwartz, to the City of Portland and dedicated for display at Pioneer Courthouse Square. This square {{is one of}} the most popular and often visited squares in the state of Oregon. In 2004 the square was named the fourth best public square in the world by New York's Project for Public Spaces. <b>Allow</b> <b>Me</b> is situated on the south side of the Square just above the amphitheatre and is seen as welcoming visitors there. The sculpture depicts a life-sized man dressed in a business suit, [...] "hurrying across the square" [...] and hailing a cab. He holds an umbrella, which some people have interpreted as an offering. He wears a watch and a rhubarb-colored tie; his index finger points towards the Meier & Frank Building, adjacent to the Square. <b>Allow</b> <b>Me</b> measures 82" [...] x 45" [...] x 50" [...] and weighs 460 pounds.

40|$|In {{the present}} text I discuss Michael Oakeshott’s idea of liberal {{education}} {{and its main}} menace, authority.

The second perspective is an application, and its concreteness <b>allows</b> <b>me</b> to employ the concept of authority in a more leisurely manner...|$|R
