5|$|Lucy only {{appears in}} the second half of the poem, where she is linked with the English landscape. As such, it seems as if nature joins with the narrator in {{mourning}} for her, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> is drawn into this mutual sorrow.|$|E
5|$|Winslet {{received}} significant awards {{attention for}} her performances in Revolutionary Road <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Reader.</b> She won two Golden Globe Awards for both these films, {{and for the}} latter, she was awarded the Academy Award and BAFTA Award for Best Actress. She surpassed her own record as the youngest actress with the most Oscar nominations, with her sixth nod at age 33. She also became the third actress in history to win two Golden Globe Awards at the same ceremony. Exhausted by the media attention she received during this period, Winslet took two years off work until {{she was ready to}} creatively engage again.|$|E

5|$|Imaginative space {{also serves}} an {{important}} function within the poem. Part one contains a rose garden that allegorically represents potential within human existence. Although the garden does not exist, it {{is described in}} realistic manner and is portrayed as an imagined reality. Also, the narrator's statement that words exist in the mind allows this imagined reality to be shared between the narrator <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader.</b> This is then destroyed by the narrator claiming that such a place has no purpose. The garden image has other uses within the poem beyond creating a shared imaginative space; it serves to invoke memories within the poem, and it functions {{in a similar manner}} in other works by Eliot, including The Family Reunion.|$|E
5|$|The {{science fiction}} romance Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), {{in which she}} played {{one of her first}} roles set in {{contemporary}} times, proved to be a turning point in her career, and she continued to gain recognition for her performances in Finding Neverland (2004), Little Children (2006), Revolutionary Road (2008), <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Reader</b> (2008). For playing a Nazi camp guard in the last of these, she won the BAFTA Award and Academy Award for Best Actress. In the 2010s, she won a Primetime Emmy Award for playing a single mother in 1950s America in the miniseries Mildred Pierce (2011), joined the Divergent film series, and won her third BAFTA Award for playing Joanna Hoffman in Steve Jobs (2015).|$|E

25|$|Scholars {{have pointed}} out that the story resembles the modern detective story genre. Both king Solomon <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> are confronted with some kind of a {{juridical}}-detective riddle. Meir Sternberg notes that two genres merge in the story: A riddle and a test; The juridical dilemma, which is the riddle, also constitutes a test for the young king: If he will solve it he will be acknowledged to possess divine wisdom. Stuart Lasine classifies the story as a law-court riddle.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{have often}} noted that Updike imbued {{language}} {{itself with a}} kind of faith in its efficacy, and that his tendency to construct narratives spanning many years and books—the Rabbit series, the Henry Bech series, Eastwick, the Maples stories—demonstrates a similar faith in the transcendent power of fiction and language. Updike's novels often act as dialectical theological debates between the book itself <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader,</b> the novel endowed with theological beliefs meant to challenge the reader as the plot runs its course. Rabbit Angstrom himself acts as a Kierkegaardian Knight of Faith.|$|E
25|$|A non-ideal op amp's {{equivalent}} circuit has a finite input impedance, a non-zero output impedance, and a finite gain. This article illustrates some typical applications of operational amplifiers. A real op amp {{has a number}} of non-ideal features as shown in the diagram, but here a simplified schematic notation is used, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> is reminded that many details such as device selection and power supply connections are not shown. Operational amplifiers are optimised for use with negative feedback, and this article discusses only negative-feedback applications. When positive feedback is required, a comparator is usually more appropriate. See Comparator applications for further information.|$|E

25|$|By {{the middle}} of the 18th century, there was a growing {{tendency}} to make explicit distinction between the condemned <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader.</b> The condemned was increasingly relegated to his social sphere; he was not seen as a sinner, someone to whom the audience could relate to, but as someone who came from an intellectually and morally inferior class. By the 1760s it was common for the Ordinary to put emphasis on grammatical and orthographic errors of the condemned and to apologise for having as subjects such mean individuals. The Ordinary frequently made claims that the condemned were creatures deserving of pity, suggesting that common criminals lacked the moral and intellectual faculties of the readers and so emphasising the distance between the reader and the condemned.|$|E
25|$|Ipomadon {{travels the}} world, {{fighting}} in tournaments, becomes King of Apulia following his father's death, and hears {{one day that}} the Proud is being besieged in her city by a knight called Lyoline. This ugly knight is threatening to take her away with him to India. Ipomadon {{makes his way to}} King Maleager's court once again, just in time to witness the arrival of the Proud's messenger, begging for some assistance for her lady. But curiously, Ipomadon has chosen to arrive at King Maleager's court {{in such a way that}} he is not recognised, not even by the queen. He pretends to be a fool, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> (or listener) is treated to a comic scene in which the fool Ipomadon is first ridiculed and then accepted by the knights and noblemen, little knowing who he really is. Cabanus is conveniently absent from court on this occasion. The maiden who has been sent as a messenger by the Proud is mightily unimpressed that a fool should wish to take on the challenge, but since nobody else in the court seems at all inclined to offer their services, the king allows Ipomadon the fool to take it up.|$|E
25|$|The diary {{abruptly}} {{picks up}} when Jared regains consciousness after {{being involved in}} an explosion. In the hospital, Jared attempts to piece together his memories, chronicling that one of B's lecture theatres was bombed; Shirin and B's inner circle are presumably all dead. Flown back to the United States to recuperate, Jared eventually confronts Fr. Lulfre from whom he learns that the Laurentian order indeed authorized both B's assassination and {{the bombing of the}} theatre. Jared renounces his devotion to the order and returns hastily back to Europe, desperately searching for any information about possible survivors of the bombing and lamenting his lack of knowledge about the people he seeks out, for example, the fact that he never even learned Shirin's last name. Ultimately, though, Jared recalls that the theatre had an underground tunnel through which Shirin and the others might have escaped. Visiting the mouth of the tunnel, which is barricaded by wooden planks, Jared finds contact information engraved in the wood. He is later reunited with Shirin and the others, and the memory comes flooding in that he warned them to flee moments before the explosion, thus saving their lives. A brief epilogue explains that Jared and Shirin plan to completely disappear from the public eye together; moments before Jared must leave to board a plane, he urges the spreading of B's philosophy and writes the final words of his diary: that Charles Atterley, Shirin, he, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader,</b> too, are all B.|$|E

500|$|Romantic writers often reacted {{against the}} {{empiricism}} of Enlightenment historical writing, putting forward {{the figure of}} the [...] "poet-historian" [...] who would mediate between the sources of history <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader,</b> using insight to create more than chronicles of facts. For this reason, Romantic historians such as Thierry saw Walter Scott, who had spent considerable effort uncovering new documents and sources for his novels, as an authority in historical writing. Scott is now seen primarily as a novelist, but also produced a nine-volume biography of Napoleon, and has been described as [...] "the towering figure of Romantic historiography in Transatlantic and European contexts", having a profound effect on how history, particularly that of Scotland, was understood and written. Historians that acknowledged his influence included Chateaubriand, Macaulay, and Ranke.|$|E
500|$|In what is [...] "perhaps {{the most}} radical {{revision}} of Austen's text", the BBC drama departs from a late 18th-century vision of emotional restraint and portrays emotions in a [...] "modern" [...] interpretation of the story. The novel leaves Elizabeth <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> uncertain of Darcy's emotions and the adaptation uses additional scenes to hint at Darcy's inability to physically contain or verbally express his emotional turmoil. On the other hand, whereas {{the climax of the}} novel describes Darcy expressing his ardent love for Elizabeth at length (though Austen leaves his actual words to the reader's imagination), the adaptation elides this moment and passes directly to the next lines of dialogue. Scholars argue that activities such as billiards, bathing, fencing and swimming (see the lake scene) offer Darcy to a female gaze; he is often presented in profile by a window or a fireplace when his friends discuss Elizabeth. Many passages relating to appearance or characters' viewpoints were lifted from the novel.|$|E
500|$|Offitt, at birth, {{was given}} the {{forenames}} Andrew Jackson, which according to Hay shows that the bearer [...] "is the son of illiterate parents, with no family pride or affections, but filled with a bitter and savage partisanship which found its expression in a servile worship of the most injurious personality in American history". Hay despised President Jackson and Jacksonian democracy, which he deemed corrupt and responsible for {{the continuation of the}} slave system that Hay saw overthrown at huge cost in the American Civil War. [...] He feared a return to values he deemed anticapitalist, and made the Bread-winners [...] "the laziest and most incapable workmen in town", whose ideals are pre-industrialist and foreign in origin. Hay saw no excuse for violence; as {{the will of the people}} could be expressed through the ballot, the remedy for any grievances was the next election. According to Gale, Hay [...] "never loses an opportunity to demean the Irish"—they are depicted as talkative and easily led (Offitt writes for the Irish Harp), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> is told that [...] "there was not an Irish laborer in the city but knew his way to his ward club as well as to mass".|$|E
30|$|Moreover, it can {{be noticed}} how the phase {{behavior}} changes with the readers’ position. In fact, when <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> {{is far from the}} tag we have (x−xTi) 2 ≫(y−yTi) 2, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> relation between <b>the</b> measured phase <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader’s</b> position on <b>the</b> x axis is almost linear (without considering the [0 ÷ 2 π] representation), that is ϕ _i(p)≈ - 4 π f_i/c (x-x_Ti).
