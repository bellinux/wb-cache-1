2500|$|In {{the stages}} of [...] "self awareness", he or she realizes their desires related to BDSM {{scenarios}} or decides to be open for such. Some authors call this internal coming-out. Two separate surveys on this topic independently {{came to the conclusion}} that 58 percent and 67 percent of the sample respectively, had realized their disposition before their 19th birthday. Other surveys on this topic show comparable results. Independent of age, coming-out can potentially result in a difficult life crisis, sometimes leading to thoughts or acts of suicide. While homosexuals have created support networks in the last decades, sadomasochistic support networks <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> develop in most countries. In German speaking countries they are only moderately more developed. The Internet is the prime contact point for support groups today, allowing for local and international networking. In the US Kink Aware Professionals (KAP) a privately funded, non-profit service provides the community with referrals to psychotherapeutic, medical, and legal professionals who are knowledgeable about and sensitive to the BDSM, fetish, and leather community. In the US and the UK, the Woodhull Freedom Foundation & Federation, National Coalition for Sexual Freedom (NCSF) and Sexual Freedom Coalition (SFC) have emerged to represent the interests of sadomasochists. The German Bundesvereinigung Sadomasochismus e.V. is committed to the same aim of providing information and driving press relations. In 1996 the website and mailing list Datenschlag went online in German and English providing the largest bibliography, as well as one of the most extensive historical collections of sources related to BDSM.|$|E

5000|$|While shared {{annotations}} {{can benefit}} individual readers, {{it is important}} to note that, [...] "since the 1920s, literacy theory has increasingly emphasized the importance of social factors in the development of literacy."

For example, a mother may leave marks inside a book to draw the attention of her child to a particular theme or concept; thanks to the development of audio annotations, parents may now leave notes for children who <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> read and may struggle with textual annotations.|$|E
