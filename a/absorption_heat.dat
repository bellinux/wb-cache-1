The heating company does not have its own energy generation {{with the exception of}} backup and peak-load boilers in the centre of the village. The energy is generated by the Egger factory from waste heat and biomass in conjunction with an <b>absorption</b> <b>heat</b> pump and is transferred at the boundary of the factory site into the district heating network. At the end of 2009 around 400 buildings and 1,300 households in St. Johann were heated by district heating. These include the district hospital, the barracks, the schools, traders, single and multi-family homes. A total of about 28 km of routing, or 56 km (double) of piping has been laid. In 2009, [...] of heating was purchased, that corresponds to an oil consumption of about [...] per year. In the medium term the introduction of district heating in St. Johann will save about 12,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually in the village centre. To read the heat meters and to visualize the individual house systems, an optical fibre was laid as part of the installation of the heating district network.|$|E
