5|$|As Rosy sleeps, Mary {{writes a}} {{confession}} explaining {{that she made}} the calls to force a reunion, knowing that Rosy would call on her for help. While she is writing, <b>an</b> <b>intruder</b> enters the apartment. The intruder is Frank (Milo Quesada), who strangles Mary. The sound of their struggle awakens Rosy, and Frank realizes he murdered the wrong woman. Frank approaches Rosy's bed, but she seizes her knife and stabs Frank. Rosy drops the knife and breaks down in hysteria.|$|E
5|$|At the Falls of Arcadia, {{a fictional}} planned {{community}} in San Diego County, California, disgruntled homeowner Dave Kline arrives {{at home to}} find a package from an unknown person. The package contains a tacky whirligig, which Kline puts on his roof to annoy the neighbors. While in bed that night, Kline hears <b>an</b> <b>intruder</b> in the house. He goes to investigate while his wife, Nancy, stays in bed. A mysterious creature attacks and kills the Klines.|$|E
5|$|At {{work at the}} Buy More, Chuck is {{approached}} at the Nerd Herd counter by Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski). After Chuck fixes Sarah's phone, {{she leaves}} him her phone number, but he decides not to call her. He arrives home to find <b>an</b> <b>intruder</b> stealing his computer. After the computer is dropped and destroyed, the intruder escapes and is revealed to be Sarah, a CIA agent.|$|E
30|$|The {{key problem}} {{is how to}} let a sensor network know <b>an</b> <b>intruder’s</b> {{direction}} if this <b>intruder</b> is <b>an</b> illegal <b>intruder</b> and how to let the network NOT identify <b>a</b> legal <b>intruder’s</b> direction as <b>an</b> illegal <b>intruder’s</b> direction. This problem is nontrivial since normally a sensor (e.g., binary sensor) individually cannot know <b>an</b> <b>intruder’s</b> movement direction when this intruder is in its sensing region. So, it requires sensors coordinate together to solve this problem.|$|R

Afterward she tells Mulder that she said it was Folie à deux, and describes it as 'a madness shared by two'. But she does not specify who the two were.|$|E
5|$|Scheer {{wrote his}} memoirs of the Great War in 1919, which were {{translated}} into English the following year. In October 1920, <b>an</b> <b>intruder</b> broke into Scheer's house and murdered his wife, Emillie, his maid, and injured his daughter Else. The man then {{committed suicide in}} the cellar. Following the incident, Scheer retreated into solitude. He wrote his autobiography, entitled Vom Segelschiff zum U-Boot (From Sailing Ship to Submarine), which was published on 6 November 1925.|$|E
5|$|Schnaufer {{submitted}} {{a proposal to}} his commander, Walter Grabmann, commanding 3. Jagd-Division (3rd Fighter Division), that a intruder operation {{be allowed to take}} place. Schnaufer proposed waiting until the enemy had crossed beyond the lines over the North Sea before attacking them. Grabmann was enthusiastic, and suggested the operation go further and attack the enemy bombers while they were attempting to land in eastern England. Schnaufer also became aware of Schmid's desire for <b>an</b> <b>intruder</b> operation at this time and personally urged him to approach the High Command once more.|$|E

40|$|A {{taxonomy}} of cryptographic protocol attacks is helpful for cryptographic protocol analysis. There are taxonomies of cryptographic protocol flaws[5, 9] and a {{taxonomy of}} replay attacks {{in terms of}} message origin and destination[25]. This paper presents an attack taxonomy based on <b>an</b> <b>intruder's</b> objectives when launching attacks and the roles s/he plays. Understanding <b>an</b> <b>intruder's</b> possible behavior and the roles s/he plays can benefit BAN-logic [4] as well as state machine-based cryptographic analysis approaches {{by allowing them to}} identify weakness and possible attacks on cryptographic protocols more efficiently. This paper also proposes several protocol design guidelines derived from the authors' observations while the taxonomy was exercised. Keywords: Cryptographic Protocol and Attack Taxonomy...|$|R
5|$|After {{discovering}} that his creation is missing, Frank {{returns to the}} lab with Brad and Riff Raff, where Frank learns that <b>an</b> <b>intruder</b> has entered the building. Brad and Janet's old high school science teacher, Dr. Everett Scott, has come looking for his nephew, Eddie. Frank suspects that Dr. Scott investigates UFOs for the government. Upon learning of Brad and Janet's connection to Dr. Scott, Frank suspects them of working for him. Frank, Dr. Scott, Brad, and Riff Raff then discover Janet and Rocky together under the sheets in Rocky's birth tank, upsetting Frank and Brad. Magenta interrupts the reunion by sounding a massive gong and stating that dinner is prepared.|$|E
5|$|Coulthard {{started from}} pole {{position}} alongside Michael Schumacher. Coulthard's teammate Häkkinen began from third. At the first corner Michael Schumacher {{moved to the}} left and Giancarlo Fisichella collided with him and both drivers retired. Häkkinen took the lead of the race which he held until <b>an</b> <b>intruder</b> penetrated circuit limits on lap 25 causing drivers to make pit stops under safety car conditions. Barrichello, meanwhile, had gained thirteen positions to run fifth until the first safety car period. Häkkinen retook the lead after Coulthard pitted on lap 27. Barrichello stayed out on dry slick tyres, taking the lead which he held to clinch the first victory of his Formula One career.|$|E
5|$|From April to September 1982, the Queen {{was anxious}} but {{proud of her}} son, Prince Andrew, who was serving with British forces during the Falklands War. On 9 July, the Queen awoke in her bedroom at Buckingham Palace to find <b>an</b> <b>intruder,</b> Michael Fagan, {{in the room with}} her. In a serious lapse of security, {{assistance}} only arrived after two calls to the Palace police switchboard. After hosting US President Ronald Reagan at Windsor Castle in 1982 and visiting his California ranch in 1983, the Queen was angered when his administration ordered the invasion of Grenada, one of her Caribbean realms, without informing her.|$|E

5|$|In reality, {{the cottage}} belongs to seven adult dwarfs, named Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey, {{who work in}} a nearby mine. Returning home, they are alarmed to find their cottage clean and suspect that <b>an</b> <b>intruder</b> has invaded their home. The dwarfs find Snow White upstairs, asleep across three of their beds. Snow White awakes to find the dwarfs at her bedside and {{introduces}} herself, {{and all of the}} dwarfs eventually welcome her into their home after they learn she can cook and clean beautifully. Snow White keeps house for the dwarfs while they mine for jewels during the day, and at night they all sing, play music and dance.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} (Anthus petrosus), or just rock pipit, is {{a species of}} small {{passerine}} bird that breeds in western Europe on rocky coasts. It has streaked greyish-brown upperparts and buff underparts, and is similar in appearance to other European pipits. There are three subspecies, of which only the Fennoscandian form is migratory, wintering in shoreline habitats further south in Europe. The Eurasian rock pipit is territorial {{at least in the}} breeding season, and year-round where it is resident. Males will sometimes enter an adjacent territory to assist the resident in repelling <b>an</b> <b>intruder,</b> behaviour only otherwise known from the African fiddler crab.|$|E
5|$|The boy Jones was <b>an</b> <b>intruder</b> {{who gained}} {{entry to the}} palace on three {{occasions}} between 1838 and 1841. At least 12 people have managed to gain unauthorised entry into the palace or its grounds since 1914, including Michael Fagan, who broke into the palace twice in 1982 and entered the Queen's bedroom on the second occasion. At the time, news media {{reported that he had}} a long conversation with the Queen while she waited for security officers to arrive, but in a 2012 interview with The Independent, Fagan said the Queen ran {{out of the room and}} no conversation took place. It was only in 2007 that trespassing on the palace grounds became a specific criminal offence.|$|E

5|$|The {{different}} ways in which this biparental sex role specialization can be influenced was studied by manipulating the presence and absence of the mate as well as the presence and absence of <b>an</b> <b>intruder.</b> The former variable was considered because the specialization of parental roles only occurs when both parents are present, while the latter variable was considered because it is thought that biparental care in these cichlids was an evolutionary consequence of the protection of offspring from intruders. When both mates are present with no intruder, both parents may stay with the offspring by resembling single parents because each parent is addressing only the offspring and not its mate, or one parent may be concentrated on activities associated with the offspring while the other parent concentrates on patrolling and defending the area. Under these isolated conditions, a more equal sharing of parental behaviors tends to occur. However, when both mates are present and <b>an</b> <b>intruder</b> is introduced, the male spends more time chasing intruders while the female remains with the offspring more. When the intruder is present but a parent is by itself, the widowed male tends to leave the offspring unattended and instead attacks the intruder or predator. Therefore, the conclusive finding is that the male rarely remains with the offspring when the female is absent, and the female rarely confronts the intruder when the male is absent.|$|E
5|$|The distant {{vision of}} a frog is better than its near vision. Calling frogs will quickly become silent when they see <b>an</b> <b>intruder</b> or even a moving shadow but the closer an object is, the less well it is seen. When a frog shoots out its tongue to catch an insect it is {{reacting}} to a small moving object that it cannot see well and must line it up precisely beforehand because it shuts its eyes as the tongue is extended. Whether a frog sees in colour is debatable {{but it has been}} shown that it responds positively to blue light, perhaps because that colour is associated with bodies of water that can provide refuge when the frog feels threatened.|$|E
5|$|Braham {{was awarded}} the first bar to his DSO on 24 September 1943. Four nights later, on the 28/29 September whilst {{carrying}} out <b>an</b> <b>intruder</b> operation between Celle and Hanover Braham encountered what he identified to be a Do 217 which engaged him in a dogfight. He downed the enemy aircraft which hit the ground and exploded. He then gained another contact on an enemy aircraft but could not quite catch it then witnessed a crash or explosion nearby. One source suggests {{the victim of the}} crash was German ace Hans-Dieter Frank (55 victories), flying a Heinkel He 219, who collided with another German fighter while trying to evade Braham. The very next night he claimed a Bf 110. His victim was identified as German ace August Geiger of IV/NJG 1 (53 victories). Geiger parachuted out of his fighter but drowned. Within minutes Braham fired on a Ju 88 which he claimed as damaged. Frank, Vinke and Geiger were the 17th, 18th and 19th most successful night fighter aces of the Second World War (and aerial warfare).|$|E

5|$|Micaëla {{enters with}} a guide, seeking José and {{determined}} to rescue him from Carmen ("Je dis que rien ne m'épouvante"). On hearing a gunshot she hides in fear; it is José, who has fired at <b>an</b> <b>intruder</b> who proves to be Escamillo. José's pleasure at meeting the bullfighter turns to anger when Escamillo declares his infatuation with Carmen. The pair fight ("Je suis Escamillo, toréro de Grenade"), but are interrupted by the returning smugglers and girls ("Holà, holà José"). As Escamillo leaves he invites everyone to his next bullfight in Seville. Micaëla is discovered; at first, José will not leave with her despite Carmen's mockery, but he agrees to go when told that his mother is dying. As he departs, vowing he will return, Escamillo is heard in the distance, singing the toreador's song.|$|E
5|$|P. exclamans {{take several}} {{countermeasures}} against invasions. If the wasps detect <b>an</b> <b>intruder</b> they will violently bite and sting the location where the C. iphitalis moth has passed by. This will cause vibrations {{inside of the}} nest and the wasps inside will become alarmed and will move around jerkily. This phenomenon {{is known as the}} parasite dance. This will continue for up to 10 hours after the moth has been detected. If the moth is found it will be eaten immediately. However, this is not likely to happen. The moth lays its eggs in the nest, and when they hatch, they will take over the nest. As a result, many wasp pupae are aborted. This is commonly seen in the late summer when the moth is most abundant.|$|E
5|$|Territory size {{is highly}} variable, ranging {{from less than}} 40km2 in the Ngorongoro Crater to over 1,000km2 in the Kalahari. Home ranges are defended through vocal displays, scent marking and {{boundary}} patrols. Clans mark their territories by either pasting or pawing in special latrines located on clan range boundaries. Clan boundaries are usually respected; hyenas chasing prey have been observed to stop dead in their tracks once their prey crosses into another clan's range. Hyenas will however ignore clan boundaries in times of food shortage. Males {{are more likely to}} enter another clan's territory than females are, as they are less attached to their natal group and will leave it when in search of a mate. Hyenas travelling in another clan's home range typically exhibit bodily postures associated with fear, particularly when meeting other hyenas. <b>An</b> <b>intruder</b> can be accepted into another clan after {{a long period of time}} if it persists in wandering into the clan's territory, dens or kills.|$|E
