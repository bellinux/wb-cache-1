40|$|The University of Canterbury {{purchased}} a modern Toyota MR 2 sports {{car with the}} intention of converting it into an electric vehicle. Similar to the common combustion engine vehicles, electric vehicles requires power and control systems to operate the 12 Vdc auxiliaries, such as lights, indicators and wipers. Traditional technology results in a large number of wires in the wiring harness. To reduce the number of wires, an alternative method is to use a pair of control lines and a universal power connection around the vehicle. This power and control system is named the "Power Distribution Network" and it is implemented by using multiple power converters and a differential control system. This thesis presents the design, implementation, and test results of the Power Distribution Network for the MR 2. The 300 Vdc nominal battery voltage is converted to an intermediate voltage of 48 V. This configuration is considered more efficient than the usual 12 V distribution system since smaller and lighter wires can be used to carry same amount of power. The Power Distribution Network operates off the 48 V intermediate voltage, and provides 12 V output power to drive all the auxiliaries in the vehicle. The Power Distribution Network also has the ability of detect faults from the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>loads</b> as well as turn on and off these loads. The Power Distribution Network is implemented with two major systems: the Auxiliary Power System, which consists of a 360 W Cuk converter with current limiting control circuits to step-down voltage from the 48 V intermediate voltage to the 12 V.

40|$|The University of Canterbury has {{purchased}} a 1992 Toyota MR 2 {{and used it}} as the platform to construct a new electric car. Similar to the common combustion engine vehicle, electric vehicles require control systems to control the operation of 12 Vdc <b>auxiliary</b> <b>loads,</b> such as lights, indicators and windscreen wipers, where traditional technology results in {{a large number of}} wires in the wiring harness. Also, with the added complexity of modern vehicles, the need for integrating independent control systems together has become very important in providing safer and more efficient vehicles. To reduce the number of wires and make it possible for different control systems to communicate, and so perform more complex tasks, a flexible and reliable control system is used. The CAN (Controller Area Network) control system is a simple two-wire differential serial bus system, which was developed by Bosch for automotive applications in the early 1980 s. The power and control system within the vehicle is named the "Power Distribution Network" and it is implemented by using multiple power converters and the CAN control system. This thesis presents the design, implementation, and test results of the CAN control system for the MR 2. The 312 Vdc nominal battery voltage is converted to an intermediate voltage of 48 Vdc. This configuration is considered more efficient than the usual 12 Vdc distribution system since smaller and lighter wires can be used to carry the same amount of power.

40|$|Two of {{the most}} {{pressing}} challenges of the automotive sector are reduction of fuel consumption and corresponding emission of greenhouse gases, especially when {{taking into account the}} growing degree of luxury in modern passenger cars, which increases the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>load</b> on the engine. Preferably, this increase in <b>auxiliary</b> <b>load</b> is compensated by the recovery of waste energy. To accomplish this, a technology called WEDACS (Waste Energy Driven Air Conditioning System) is being developed to recover throttling losses. WEDACS uses a turbine to induce provide the engine with the same air mass flow rate as a throttle valve while producing mechanical energy and cold air. An alternator coupled to this turbine converts mechanical energy into electrical energy and the cold air is used to cool A/C fluid. This way the load of both the engine mounted alternator and A/C compressor is reduced or eliminated, resulting in higher efficiency. A previous paper [1] provides a proof of principle, using a turbine from a turbocharger, but also discusses a challenge {{in the form of a}} limited operating range). The present paper focuses on addressing this challenge. To expand the control range of the engine, a turbocharger with variable nozzle turbine is used. Due to limitations in the variable nozzle mechanism, the range is limited to higher engine powers. It is shown that between 50 W and 1. 3 kW of energy can be recovered from a 2 liter engine, depending on the operating point. A second turbocharger's variable nozzle mechanism is adapted to enable control of a 2 liter engine from idle to about 50 % engine power. With decreasing engine power, the energy recovery efficiency eventually drops to zero. The root cause for this is identified and an attempt is made to improve efficiency. Finally the drive cycle model from the previous paper is expanded and a new drive cycle simulation shows a fuel consumption improvement over the NEDC of about 5 to 8 % for a mid-sized passenger car with a 2 liter engine...|$|E
