Today the only recognisable parties are the Boutokaan te Koaua Party, Maneaban te Mauri Party, Maurin Kiribati Party and Tabomoa Party. There is universal suffrage at age 18.|$|E
25|$|In December 2013, the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) held fresh elections. However, {{the results}} were {{postponed}} 6 times by the Supreme Court due to court cases filed by Kishore Rungta and the BCCI. On 6 May 2014, Lalit Modi was re-elected as the President of Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA), while residing in London. Immediately after his election, the BCCI banned the RCA and elected an <b>adhoc</b> body to carry administrative function of RCA. Lalit Modi took the legal route to fight BCCI's declaration.|$|E
25|$|Einstein's {{theory was}} framed {{in terms of}} {{kinematics}} (the study of moving bodies), and showed how quantification of distances and times varied for measurements made in different reference frames. His theory was a breakthrough advance over Lorentz's 1904 theory of electromagnetic phenomena and Poincaré's electrodynamic theory. Although these theories included equations identical to those that Einstein introduced (i.e. the Lorentz transformation), they were essentially <b>adhoc</b> models proposed to explain the results of various experiments—including the famous Michelson–Morley interferometer experiment—that were extremely difficult to fit into existing paradigms.|$|E
25|$|In 1966 Sagan was {{a member}} of the <b>AdHoc</b> Committee to Review Project Blue Book, the U.S.Air Force's UFO {{investigation}} project. The committee concluded Blue Book had been lacking as a scientific study, and recommended a university-based project to give the UFO phenomenon closer scientific scrutiny. The result was the Condon Committee (1966–68), led by physicist Edward Condon, and in their final report they formally concluded that UFOs, regardless of what any of them actually were, did not behave in a manner consistent with a threat to national security.|$|E
25|$|United States {{security}} {{assistance to}} the Palestinian Authority (PA) has been provided since the Palestinian Authority was established by the Oslo Accords in the mid-1990s. The security assistance was given on an <b>adhoc</b> basis and often covert at the outset. Since 2005 the U.S. State Department has provided direct financial and personnel assistance to Palestinian security organizations when they established {{the office of the}} United States Security Coordinator (USSC) for Israel and the Palestinian territories through their Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL). In 2007 the USSC team began training certain Palestinian Authority Security Forces (PASF) including the Palestinian National Security Forces (NSF) and the Presidential Guard with the intent to train, equip, and garrison 10 NSF battalions by the end of 2010. U.S. security {{assistance to the}} Palestinian Authority has expanded over the years and has received praise as well as criticism from American, Palestinian, and Israeli groups.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Agyarko's ministerial {{confirmation}} in February 2017, he {{was accused}} by Mahama Ayariga of the parliamentary appointment committee of bribing members of the minority to facilitate his approval as a Minister of energy. Ayariga reported on Radio Gold, that Agyarko through Muntaka Mubarak, the minority chief whip, had tried to influence {{the decision of the}} Appointments Committee of Parliament by giving each minority member a bribe. The Speaker of Parliament, Aaron Mike Oquaye set up an <b>adhoc</b> parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. After the investigation, the Joe Ghartey committee exonerated Agyarko but cited and found Ayariga guilty of being in contempt of parliament for making false allegations against a colleague and bringing the parliament into disrepute. Ayariga was made to render an apology on the floor of parliament and warned to be mindful of his actions in the future. After his ministerial appointment was approved, Ayariga publicly praised Agyarko for his track record asserting that his nomination was approved on merit.|$|E

Henry Mayhew visited Bethnal Green in 1850 and wrote for the Morning Chronicle, {{as a part of a}} series forming the basis for London Labour and the London Poor (1851), that the trades in the area included tailors, costermongers, shoemakers, dustmen, sawyers, carpenters, cabinet makers and silkweavers.

500|$|Beecham first {{conducted}} in public in St Helens in October 1899, with an <b>adhoc</b> ensemble comprising local musicians and {{players from the}} Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and the Hallé in Manchester. [...] A month later, he stood in at short notice for the celebrated conductor Hans Richter at a concert by the Hallé to mark Joseph Beecham's inauguration as mayor of St Helens. Soon afterwards, Joseph Beecham secretly committed his wife to a mental hospital. Thomas and his elder sister Emily helped to secure their mother's release and to force their father to pay annual alimony of £4,500. For this, Joseph disinherited them. Beecham was estranged from his father for ten years.|$|E
500|$|The Derry Housing Action Committee (DHAC) {{was formed}} in March 1968 {{by members of the}} Derry Branch of the Northern Ireland Labour Party and the James Connolly Republican Club, {{including}} Eamonn McCann and Eamon Melaugh. [...] It disrupted a meeting of Londonderry Corporation in March 1968 and in May blocked traffic by placing a caravan that was home to a family of four {{in the middle of the}} Lecky Road in the Bogside and staging a sit-down protest at the opening of the second deck of the Craigavon Bridge. [...] After the meeting of Londonderry Corporation was again disrupted in August, Eamon Melaugh telephoned the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) and invited them to hold a march in Derry. The date chosen was 5 October 1968, an <b>adhoc</b> committee was formed (although in reality most of the organizing was done by McCann and Melaugh) and the route was to take the marchers inside the city walls, where nationalists were traditionally not permitted to march. The Minister of Home Affairs, William Craig, made an order on 3 October prohibiting the march on the grounds that the Apprentice Boys of Derry were intending to hold a march on the same day. [...] In the words of Martin Melaugh of CAIN [...] "this particular tactic...provided the excuse needed to ban the march." [...] When the marchers attempted to defy the ban on 5 October they were stopped by a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) cordon. [...] The police drew their batons and struck marchers, including Stormont MP Eddie McAteer and Westminster MP Gerry Fitt. Subsequently, the police [...] "broke ranks and used their batons indiscriminately on people in Duke Street". Marchers trying to escape met another party of police and [...] "these police also used their batons indiscriminately." [...] Water cannons were also used. The police action caused outrage in the nationalist area of Derry, and at a meeting four days later the Derry Citizens' Action Committee (DCAC) was formed, with John Hume as chairman and Ivan Cooper as vice-chairman.|$|E

It usually derives from marketing research, most accurately from panel research, but also from <b>adhoc</b> work.

However, these are often based on categories that make bureaucratic sense but are less helpful in marketing terms. The 'usage gap' is thus: ...|$|E
2500|$|Savoeun {{was chosen}} to succeed Hoc Lundy by Hun Sen and {{appointed}} by royal decree of Cambodian king Norodom Sihamoni on 11 November 2008. He was officially sworn into office on 21 November by Interior Minister Sar Kheng amid allegations of nepotism and lack of qualifications. Kem Sokha, {{who at the time}} was president of the Human Rights Party, remarked [...] "...he has not graduated from the Police Academy, and his rank comes from his relations to a high-ranking official, or nepotism", but he and others such as Chan Soveth of <b>ADHOC</b> and Interior Minister Sar Kheng expressed hope that Savoeun would discontinue the practices of his predecessor and reform the organization even though the National Police had never been allowed to operate independent of the CPP-controlled government.|$|E

It was widely speculated {{that he would be}} given the interim charge of the BCCI {{in the aftermath of the}} 2013 Indian Premier League spot-fixing case. But he refused to be the caretaker chief of BCCI, if N. Srinivasan continues in his role as the BCCI president. He had told BCCI vice-president Arun Jaitley in clear terms before 2 June 2013 working committee meeting that he was [...] "not interested" [...] in taking charge of the Board on an ad-hoc basis because such an <b>adhoc</b> appointment is void as per the BCCI constitution.
