25|$|A tumor {{suppressor}} gene, or <b>anti-oncogene,</b> is a {{gene that}} protects a cell from one step {{on the path to}} cancer. When this gene is mutated to cause a loss or reduction in its function, the cell can progress to cancer, usually in combination with other genetic changes. In 1986, Robert Weinberg and a team of researchers working under his direction made a seminal discovery when they isolated Rb, or the retinoblastoma protein, the first known growth-suppressor gene.|$|E
50|$|ETV6 (i.e. translocation-Ets-leukemia virus) {{protein is}} a {{transcription}} factor that in humans is encoded by the ETV6 (previously known as TEL) gene. The ETV6 protein regulates {{the development and}} growth of diverse cell types, particularly those of hematological tissues. However, its gene, ETV6 frequently suffers various mutations that lead to an array of potentially lethal cancers, i.e., ETV6 is a clinically significant proto-oncogene in that it can fuse with other genes to drive the development and/or progression of certain cancers. However, ETV6 is also an <b>anti-oncogene</b> or tumor suppressor gene in that mutations in it that encode for a truncated and therefore inactive protein are also associated with certain types of cancers.|$|E

RT-PCR method was used to detect the mRNA expression of proto-oncogene and <b>anti-oncogene</b> in three groups, Western-blot method was used to detect the protein expression of Sox- 2 and Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway. Results: mRNA expression of oncogene DEK, Bmi- 1, c-fos, K-ras, Prdx 4 in high-risk HPV group were higher than low-risk HPV group and control group (P< 0. 05); mRNA expression of <b>anti-oncogene</b> P 27, P 16, DAPK, PTEN, eIF 4 E 3 in high-risk HPV group were lower than low-risk HPV group and control group (P< 0. 05); expression of Sox- 2 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway protein Sox- 2, β-catenin, wnt- 1, wnt- 3 a in high-risk HPV group were higher than low-risk HPV group and control group (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: Highrisk HPV infection can increase the expression of oncogenes and reduce the expression of anti-oncogenes in cervical dysplasia tissues on Sox- 2 - and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway manners...|$|E

The progress in radiochemis-try, radiopharmacy and, foremost, the advances in molecular oncology are the determinant mutagenic factors. Mutation, ampli fication, deletion or translocation of deoxyribonucleic acid seg ments in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes also called <b>anti-oncogenes</b> account for the uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation resulting in cancer. The astonishing develop ments in peptide and nucleic acid chemistry have opened the door for the development of new, highly specific probes such as antisense, aptamer and peptidomimetic molecules to image the oncogenes and <b>anti-oncogenes</b> transcriptional (messenger ribo-nucleic acid) and translational (protein) products involved in carcinogenesis.

40|$|Suppression of high M(r) tropomyosins (TMs) is {{a common}} feature of {{transformed}} cells. Previous work from this laboratory has demonstrated that the isoform 1 of TM, TM 1, acts as an <b>anti-oncogene</b> in ras-transformed murine fibroblasts. In this study, we have investigated whether TM 1 is a ras-specific suppressor, or a general suppressor protein of the cellular transformation. V-src transformed fibroblasts, which express decreased TM 1, were transduced with a full-length cDNA to overexpress TM 1. Both the control and the transduced cells expressed v-src kinase at comparable levels. TM 1 expressing (src-T 1) cells grew at a lower rate in monolayer, exhibited well spread, flat morphology than the control cells. Enhanced expression of TM 1 resulted in improved microfilamental architecture. More significantly, src-T 1 cells completely failed to grow under anchorage independent conditions.

40|$|Primary {{hepatocellular}} carcinoma (PHC), epidemiologically associated with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, {{has historically been}} felt {{to be caused by}} the activation or introduction of an oncogene. However, transforming sequences from human PHC have not been reproducibly isolated. In this paper, evidence is presented that suggests PHC may result instead from the loss of an <b>anti-oncogene.</b> Seven of 12 human primary liver tumors tested against a panel of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) demonstrated loss of constitutional heterozygosity for markers on chromosome 4. Tumor and nontumor liver tissue were typed for 11 chromosome 4 RFLPs. In addition, at least one RFLP on nine other chromosomes (1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, and 17) was tested for allelic loss. Seven of nine tumors constitutionally heterozygous for chromosome 4 q markers showed allele loss in tumor tissue. Six of the seven samples were jointly informative for both 4 p and 4 q markers. Five of the six demonstrated loss for only 4 q RFLPs. In one individual, in which two samples were taken from distant locations within the same tumor, both samples showed loss of the same alleles. Among the other chromosomes informative for allele loss, one tumor showed changes on 13 q. No other changes were observed in RFLPs located on the eight other chromosomes tested. These results indicate that an <b>anti-oncogene</b> may be located on 4 q and suggest a mechanism for PHC and other cancers seroepidemiologically related to virus infection. Liver cancer caused by chronic HBV infection or other environmental agents may be linked through genetic events responsible for the loss of a tumor suppressor locus (<b>anti-oncogene)</b> located on chromosome 4...|$|E

40|$|Short SurveyThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] evidence strongly suggests that cancer is a genetic disease, arising from mutations in DNA. These mutations alter the function or synthesis of two groups of proteins, which are the products of either proto-oncogenes or anti-oncogenes. Of the more than 30 proto-oncogenes identified, ras proto-oncogenes are most frequently found to be mutationally activated (to oncogenes) in human tumours. Developments leading to current understanding of the function of ras proto-oncogenes and of the retinoblastoma <b>anti-oncogene</b> are reviewed.

Methods:The regulatory effects of puerarin on endometriotic angiopoiesis and tumor-related gene expression were observed by using a chicken chorioallantoic membrane model and gene array method. Results: Chicken chorioallantoic membrane experiment indicated that puerarin obviously inhibited endometriotic vasiculation and angiopoiesis. The area of blood vessels was significantly reduced {{as compared with the}} untreated group (P< 0. 05). The expressions of oncogenes and genes related to adhesion, invasion, and apoptosis, including ERBB 2, ETS 2, FOS, S 100 A 4, TEK, TERT, NFKBIA, CDH 1, CD 44, ITGA 6, NCAM 1, MMP 1, FLT 1, AKT 1, BCL 2 L and BIRC 5 genes, were obviously higher, while the expressions of the <b>anti-oncogenes,</b> anti-apoptosis genes and anti-invasion genes, including KAI 1, KISS 1, SERPINB 5, TNFRSF 25, TNFRSF 1 A, TNFRSF 6 and SERPINB 2, were significantly lower in eutopic endometrial tissue from patients with endometriosis than those from endometriosis-free women. The expressions of oncogenes (ERBB 2, ETS 2, FOS), apoptosis gene (BCL 2 L 1), cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK 4, CDC 25 A), and growth factor and receptors (HGF, FGFR 2, TGFBR) were significantly enhanced, while the expressions of the <b>anti-oncogenes</b> (KAI 1, SERPINB 5), apoptosis genes (BAD and TNF) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibiting factor (CDKN 2 A) were obviously reduced in ectopic tissue as compared with those in eutopic tissue from patients with endometriosis. Puerarin significantly enhanced the gene expressions in endometriotic stromal cells, including BAD, BAX, CASP 8, CASP 9, TNFRSF 6, CDKN 1 B, CDKN 2 A, IFNA 1 and IFNB 1, and reduced the gene expressions of FOS, CHEK 2, SRC, ITGB 5, MMP 9, PDGFA and NFKBIA. Conclusions: The tumor-related gene expression has significant differences in eutopic endometrial tissue between patients with endometriosis and endometriosis-free women, and between ectopic and eutopic tissues from patients with endometriosis.

40|$|Abstract Background Oncogene {{signaling}} {{is known}} to deregulate cell proliferation resulting in uncontrolled growth and cellular transformation. Gene amplification and/or somatic mutations of the HER 2 /Neu (ErbB 2) proto-oncogene occur in approximately 20 % of breast cancers. A therapeutic strategy {{that has been used}} to block HER 2 function is the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib. Using human mammary epithelial cells that overexpress HER 2, we determined the anti-proliferative effect of lapatinib through measuring the total cell number and analyzing the cell cycle distribution. A mathematical model was used to interpret the experimental data. Results The model suggests that lapatinib acts as expected by slowing the transition through G 1 phase. However, the experimental data indicated a previously unreported late cytotoxic effect, which was incorporated into the model. Both effects depend on the dosage of the drug, which shows saturation kinetics. Conclusion The model separates quantitatively the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of lapatinib and may have implications for preclinical studies with other <b>anti-oncogene</b> therapies. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background PTEN is an <b>anti-oncogene</b> {{frequently}} inactivating in glioma. The {{previous study}} found that PTEN was closely related to cellular autophagy activity. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to study whether the inactivation of PTEN in glioma stem/progenitor cells (GSPCs) is correlative with the low autophagic activity in GSPCs. Methods Wild-type PTEN genes were transferred into GSPCs mediated by adenovirus. The autophagic activity in GSPCs before or after the introduction of wild-type PTEN was detected by immunocytochemistry, electron microscopy, and Western blotting assay. Results After transfection of wild-type PTEN, a large number of microtuble-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (MAP 1 LC 3) -positive granules could be found in the cytoplasm of GSPCs under a confocal microscopy, and these granules were demonstrated to be autophagosomes under an electron microscope. Moreover, the expression of autophagy-related gene Beclin- 1 significantly increased after the transfection of wild-type PTEN gene.

40|$|The {{activation}} of signal transduction pathways by mutation or overexpression of cellular oncogenes {{has been associated}} with neoplastic transformation. In this study, we addressed the therapeutic potential of ribozymes targeted against the activated H-ras oncogene as well as against the nuclear proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-myc in the FEM human melanoma cell line containing a H-ras mutation. FEM cells transfected with the anti-ras ribozyme were shown to have the longest doubling time, the least DNA synthesis, and the fewest colonies in soft agar when compared with transfectants with ribozymes against c-fos or c-myc mRNA. Furthermore, anti-ras ribozyme clones showed a dendritic appearance in monolayer culture that was associated with enhanced melanin synthesis. These results suggest that the anti-ras ribozyme could affect not only the proliferation but also the differentiation process of human melanoma cells in vitro. They also reinforce the role of <b>anti-oncogene</b> ribozymes as suppressors of the neoplastic phenotype of melanoma cells...|$|E
40|$|Small {{heterodimer}} partner (SHP, NR 0 B 2) is {{a unique}} orphan nuclear receptor that contains the dimerization and a putative ligand-binding domain, but lacks the conserved DNA binding domain. SHP exerts its physiological function as an inhibitor of gene transcription through physical interaction with multiple nuclear receptors and transcriptional factors. SHP is a critical transcriptional regulator affecting diverse biological functions, including bile acid, cholesterol and lipid metabolism, glucose and energy homeostasis, and reproductive biology. Recently, we and others have demonstrated that SHP is an epigenetically regulated transcriptional repressor that suppresses the development of liver cancer. In this review, we summarize recent major findings regarding the role of SHP in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA methylation, and discuss recent progress in understanding the function of SHP as a tumor suppressor {{in the development of}} liver cancer.

40|$|Cancer cells contain {{genetic damage}} {{that can lead}} to tumorigenesis. Genetic damage found in cancer cells is of two types: {{dominant}} and the genes are termed protooncogenes; and recessive and the genes are termed tumor or growth suppressors, recessive oncogenes or <b>anti-oncogenes.</b> Oncogene proteins are a specific group of growth factors that promotes uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. These proteins are derived from normal proto-oncogenes via a limited number of modifications, i. e mutations, insertions or deletions. Because proto-oncogenes control the cell cycle, it is obvious that should a proto-oncogene be mutated the potential for an unregulated cell cycle results. Therefore, a structure-function analysis of oncogene proteins is of great importance in understanding cell transformation that causes cancer development. In this paper we present and discuss the use of two related computational techniques for analysis of ras oncongene protein example.

40|$|Within {{the past}} decade a large {{repertoire}} of cellular oncogenes has been implicated in the genesis of many types of cancers. These oncogenes all function to promote the neoplastic growth of cells in which they act. Indeed, they all appear to derive from normal cell genes, proto-oncogenes, which act to stimulate normal cell proliferation. During this period, evidence has also been presented to suggest that elements that normally function to inhibit cell proliferation are also {{playing a role in}} the process of carcinogenesis. For instance, in a number of distinct types of tumors it was found that genetic material from specific chromosomal loci was absent in tumor DNAs, but present in the adjacent normal cell DNA. This indicates that loss of genetic material represents at least one step in the pathogenesis of these tumors. It seems likely that the normal function of the genes that are lost in these tumors is to restrain the growth of cells from which the tumors originate. For this reason such genes have been named recessive oncogenes or <b>anti-oncogenes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Retinoblastoma, a {{malignancy}} {{of the eye}} {{occurring in}} young children, has been widely studied {{as a model for}} genetic predisposition to cancer. This disease is caused by mutations in both alleles of an <b>anti-oncogene</b> (the retinoblastoma gene, Rb) that inactivate or eliminate the Rb encoded protein, pl 05 rb. Here we report that expression of a viral oncogene, the simian virus 40 T antigen, in the retina of transgenic mice produces heritable ocular tumours with histological, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical features identical to those of human retinoblastoma. Furthermore, we demonstrate a specific association between plO 5 rb and T antigen in mouse retinoblastoma tumour cells. Thus, the occurrence of these tumours is in vivo evidence for oncogenesis due to the ocular-specific expression of an Rb-binding oncoprotein that can functionally inactivate the Rb protein. As an animal model for heritable retinoblastoma, these mice should allow the study of the ontogeny, pathogenesis and treatment of this malignant disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} {{hereditary}} cancer in humans, notably retinoblastoma, has identified {{a category of}} cancer genes {{that is different from}} that of the oncogenes. Whereas the latter group of genes exerts its effect through expression, the former does so as a result of failure of normal expression. Primary oncogene abnormality seems to play a crucial initiating role in certain neoplasms, particularly leukaemias, lymphomas and some sarcomas. In contrast, anti-oncogenes (tumour suppressor genes) appear to be important in the initiation of several solid tumours of children, as well as some common carcinomas of adults. Both classes are apparently involved in tumour progression and metastasis. Virtually every kind of cancer can occur in hereditary form, so the role of anti-oncogenes in the origin of human cancers may be considerable.

We investigated the expression of p 53 protein by immunohistochemical analysis using the anti-p 53 polyclonal antibody (CM- 1) in 17 thymomas and 19 thymic carcinomas. We also examined p 53 gene (exon 5 - 8) mutation in 18 thymic carcinomas by using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism methods and direct sequencing. Of the thymoma cases, only one invasive thymoma showed focal nuclear staining. Fourteen of the 19 thymic carcinomas (74 %) showed nuclear staining. Point mutations of the p 53 gene were recognized in only 2 of the 18 thymic carcinomas (11 %). One was the mutation C to T transition in the first letter of codon 222 in exon 6, which results in the amino acid substitution from proline to serine.

A human breast cancer xenograft assay was performed to validate the stem cell properties of the isolated cells, and microarray analysis was performed to screen for BCSC-related miRNAs. These BCSC-related miRNAs were selected for bioinformatic analysis and target prediction using online software programs. Results: The ESA + CD 44 + CD 24 -/low cells had up to 100 - to 1000 -fold greater tumor-initiating capability than the MCF- 7 cells. Tumors initiated from the ESA + CD 44 + CD 24 -/low cells were included of luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells, indicating stem cell properties.

Many factors are known to interfere with both normal and pathological controls of growth and differentiation of thyroid cells. Among them, some are oncogenes, like those encoding g-proteins (ras, gsp, TSH-R), encoding thyrosino kinases receptors (RET, trk, c-met, c-erb, BRAF) and encoding nuclear proteins (c-myc, e-fós). Others are <b>anti-oncogenes</b> (p 53, p 15, RB), by loss of the growth suppression ativity of the suppressive gene. Cancer cell invasion and metastasis are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. Many genes are involved in the mechanism of invasion and metastasis of thyroid tumors, like Nis, b-catenina, E-caderina, galectina- 3, GLUT, telomerase, VEGT, nm- 23. All these oncogenes, antioncogenes and tumor invasion and metastasis-related genes are analysed.

It has been well established that multicellular eukaryotes utilize miRNAs to regulate many biological processes such as embryonic development, proliferation, differentiation, and cell death. Recent studies have shown that miRNAs may provide new insight in cancer research. A recent study demonstrated that more than 50 % of miRNA genes are located in fragile sites and cancer-associated genomic regions, suggesting that miRNAs may play a more important role in the pathogenesis of human cancers. Exploiting the emerging knowledge of miRNAs for the development of new human therapeutic applications will be important.

We found that expression of miR- 328 was significantly decreased both in anaplastic and GBM cohorts and that low miR- 328 expression also conferred poor survival in primary GBM (PGBM) patients. MiR- 328 might, therefore, serve as an independent prognostic marker. Furthermore, expression profiles of miR- 328 -associated mRNAs were established via microarrays for 60 GBM samples. The ontology of the miR- 328 -associated genes was then analyzed, which identified gene sets tightly related to cell mitosis. In addition, ectopic expression of miR- 328 inhibited U 87 cell proliferation and induced U 87 cell cycle arrest. In conclusion, this is the first report showing that miR- 328 is associated with patient’s survival time and that miR- 328 might serve as an independent prognostic biomarker for GBM...|$|E
40|$|MYCN activation, {{mainly by}} gene amplification, {{is one of}} the most {{frequent}} molecular events in neuroblastoma (NB) oncogenesis, and is associated with increased malignancy and decreased neuronal differentiation propensity. The frequency of concomitant loss of heterozygosity at the 1 p 36. 3 locus, which harbours the p 53 <b>anti-oncogene</b> homologue TP 73, indicates that MYCN and p 73 alterations may cooperate in the pathogenesis of NB. We have previously shown that p 73 isoforms are deregulated in NB tumours and that TAp 73 co-operates synergistically with p 53 for apoptosis of NB cells, whereas ΔNp 73 activates the expression of neuronal differentiation genes such as BTG 2. Herein, using both ectopic expression and RNA interference-mediated silencing of p 73 in MYCN amplified NB cells, we show that p 73 α isoforms inhibit MYCN expression at both transcript and protein levels, in spite of transactivator effects on MYCN promoter. To explain this paradox, we found that TAp 73 α exerts negative post-transcriptional effects leading to reduced MYCN mRNA stability. RNA immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that this dominant inhibitory post-transcriptional effect could be due to an interaction between the p 73 protein and MYCN mRNA, a hypothesis also raised for the regulation of certain genes by the p 53 protein...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHuman oligodendrogliomas are chemosensitive gliomas usually {{characterized}} by a loss of heterozygosity in the large distal regions of the short arm of chromosome 1 (1 p LOH). Chemoresistant astrocytomas do not have this genetic signature, suggesting that the 1 p arms may contain <b>anti-oncogene</b> and/or genes enabling chemoresistance. We have focused here on two human 1 p-distal genes, ATAD 3 A and ATAD 3 B (1 p 36 - 33), and analyzed their gene products in normal human cell lines and tissues and in glioma-derived human cell lines. Using specific anti-peptide antibodies, {{we have found that}} ATAD 3 A is ubiquitously expressed, whereas ATAD 3 B is expressed in embryonic tissues, adult germinative zone and in astrocytoma cell lines but it is not expressed in oligodendroglioma cell lines or in the adult cortex. Furthermore, we have found that human glioma cell lines overexpressing or underexpressing ATAD 3 A and ATAD 3 B, show modified cell growth, anchorage-independent growth, and chemoresistance to doxorubicin and other genotoxic drugs. These results demonstrate the potential for ATAD 3 B as a putative marker in discriminating astrocytomas from oligodendrogliomas. We also have shown that the loss of ATAD 3 A/ 3 B may be involved in the transformation pathway and the chemosensitivity of oligodendrogliomas...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the miRNA profile in breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) and to explore the functions of characteristic BCSC miRNAs. Methods We isolated ESA + CD 44 + CD 24 -/low BCSCs from MCF- 7 cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). A human breast cancer xenograft assay was performed to validate the stem cell properties of the isolated cells, and microarray analysis was performed to screen for BCSC-related miRNAs. These BCSC-related miRNAs were selected for bioinformatic analysis and target prediction using online software programs. Results The ESA + CD 44 + CD 24 -/low cells had up to 100 - to 1000 -fold greater tumor-initiating capability than the MCF- 7 cells. Tumors initiated from the ESA + CD 44 + CD 24 -/low cells were included of luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells, indicating stem cell properties. We also obtained miRNA profiles of ESA + CD 44 + CD 24 -/low BCSCs. Most of the possible targets of potential tumorigenesis-related miRNAs were oncogenes, <b>anti-oncogenes</b> or regulatory genes. Conclusions We identified a subset of miRNAs that were differentially expressed in BCSCs, providing a starting point to explore the functions of these miRNAs. Evaluating characteristic BCSC miRNAs represents a new method for studying breast cancer-initiating cells and developing therapeutic strategies aimed at eradicating the tumorigenic subpopulation of cells in breast cancer. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background DNA {{copy number}} {{aberration}} (CNA) {{is very important}} in the pathogenesis of tumors and other diseases. For example, CNAs may result in suppression of <b>anti-oncogenes</b> and activation of oncogenes, which would cause certain types of cancers. High density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data is widely used for the CNA detection. However, it is nontrivial to detect the CNA automatically because the signals obtained from high density SNP arrays often have low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which might be caused by whole genome amplification, mixtures of normal and tumor cells, experimental noise or other technical limitations. With the reduction in SNR, many false CNA regions are often detected and the true CNA regions are missed. Thus, more sophisticated statistical models are needed to make the CNAs detection, using the low SNR signals, more robust and reliable. Results This paper presents a conditional random pattern (CRP) model for CNA detection where much contextual cues are explored to suppress the noise and improve CNA detection accuracy. Both simulated and the real data are used to evaluate the proposed model, and the validation results show that the CRP model is more robust and reliable in the presence of noise for CNA detection using high density SNP array data, compared to a number of widely used software packages. Conclusions The proposed conditional random pattern (CRP) model could effectively detect the CNA regions in the presence of noise. </p...|$|R
40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as {{a member}} of the {{herpesvirus}} family persists lifelong in the human body and causes diseases associated with virus replication (infectious mononucleosis, oral hairy leukoplakia) as well as neoplastic conditions such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, B-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease associated with viral latency. This complex biology relates to a highly regulated control of the persisting virus. Still, EBV is lytically produced in certain compartments of the human body. Epithelial cells were found to be of key importance for this. Various routes (cell fusion, IgA receptor-mediated uptake) were described for EBV to enter epithelial cells in the absence of CR 2 receptor. Viral entry into cells, however, via CR 2 receptor fusion or IgA mediated was not found to be sufficient for viral production. The molecular mechanisms for the lack of viral production in most target cells are primarily the presence of silencer activities and the early elimination of cells entering the lytic cycle. Only terminally differentiated epithelial cells are capable of supporting an efficient lytic cycle of EBV replication. EBV-mediated suppression of apoptosis as well as down-regulation of cellular and viral gene products, such as HLA molecules, which mediate recognition by the immune system, are important contributing factors to the development of these neoplasias where viral genes, possibly via interaction with <b>anti-oncogenes,</b> such as p 53, in context with genetic and environmental factors play a key role. Novel diagnostic tools and a vaccine have been developed which could help to control EBV-related diseases...|$|R
