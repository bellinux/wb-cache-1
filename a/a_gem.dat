5|$|Another {{objective}} {{to finding}} and defeating Malkil in Wizards & WarriorsIII {{is to find}} four secret gems which will unlock the hidden passage through the town of Piedup to the castle's throne room where the evil wizard is located. To do this, Kuros must rescue King James' three princesses who are hidden somewhere in Piedup; each of them will grant Kuros <b>a</b> <b>gem</b> and agree to marry him when rescued. The final gem is obtained by defeating a dragon in the town's underworld.|$|E
5|$|Diamond {{enhancements}} {{are specific}} treatments performed on natural or synthetic diamonds (usually those already cut and polished into <b>a</b> <b>gem),</b> which {{are designed to}} better the gemological characteristics of the stone {{in one or more}} ways. These include laser drilling to remove inclusions, application of sealants to fill cracks, treatments to improve a white diamond's color grade, and treatments to give fancy color to a white diamond.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} 1998 {{annual meeting of}} the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, held in Utah, United States, rumors were {{circulating}} about a striking fossil of a primitive bird that was in private hands. This fossil was presented by an anonymous dealer at <b>a</b> <b>gem</b> show in Tucson, Arizona. The Dinosaur Museum in Blanding, Utah, purchased it in February 1999. The museum is run by Stephen A. Czerkas and his wife, Sylvia Czerkas. Mr. Czerkas does not hold a university degree, but he is a dinosaur enthusiast and artist. He arranged for patrons of his museum, including trustee Dale Slade, to provide $80,000 for the purchase of the fossil, in order to study it scientifically and prevent it from disappearing into an anonymous private collection.|$|E

5|$|In the 20th century, {{a legendary}} doll maker named Rozen created seven bisque dolls which were powered and given sentience with <b>a</b> <b>gem</b> called Rosa Mystica. Since then, Rozen sent the dolls away to find masters and to battle among {{themselves}} to gather each other's Rosa Mysticas; this competition {{is referred to}} as the Alice Game. When a doll obtains all seven, they are to become a perfect doll dubbed as Alice and will be reunited with Rozen. By order of creation, the seven Rozen Maidens are named Suigintou, Kanaria, Suiseiseki, Souseiseki, Shinku, Hinaichigo, and Kirakisho.|$|E

It can be brandished to deflect projectile attacks, reminiscent of Simon Belmont's {{usage of the}} weapon in Super Castlevania IV. A variety of ranged sub-weapons—holy water, a dagger, a holy book, a cross, <b>a</b> <b>gem,</b> an axe, and a thunder gauntlet—are available, one {{of which can be}} carried at any given time and combined with one of the five spell books—Fire Book, Ice Book, Bolt Book, Wind Book, and the Summoning Tome—hidden throughout the castle to create a magical attack. Casting a spell renders the player character invincible for a moment.|$|E
5|$|Intergem {{rocked the}} gem trade by {{marketing}} the Yogo as the world's only guaranteed untreated sapphire. By 1982, {{the practice of}} routinely heat treating gems had become {{a major issue in}} the industry. At the time, 95percent of all the world's sapphires were being heated to enhance their natural color. Thai traders had even purchased large quantities of naturally colorless Sri Lankan sapphires, known as geuda, and heated them to an artificial blue. A problem with the practice was that heated gems often fade over time, though trained gemologists can detect a heated gem with 95percent accuracy. Intergem's marketing of guaranteed untreated Yogos set them against many in the gem industry. In 1985 there was a movement in Pennsylvania to require disclosure that <b>a</b> <b>gem</b> had been treated. Intergem's strategy resulted in large numbers of gem professionals visiting Yogo Gulch.|$|E

5|$|One year later, Crash {{is living}} with his younger sister Coco on N. Sanity Island, one of the islands owned by Cortex in the {{previous}} game. After Coco's laptop battery dies, she forces a sleeping Crash to get her a new one. While doing so, Crash is abducted by a bright light and finds himself in an old Warp Room hidden in Cortex's castle, where a holographic projection of Cortex instructs him to bring him the crystals by traveling through the Warp Room's doors. After Crash collects a crystal, Cortex informs Crash of the upcoming destructive force and assigns him the task of bringing all of the crystals to him so that he may contain it. After retrieving <b>a</b> <b>gem,</b> Crash is greeted by a hologram from Doctor Nitrus Brio, Cortex's former assistant from the previous game, who is now out to stop Cortex's plans for world domination. Brio explains that the Earth contains gems in addition to crystals, and that collecting 42 gems will allow Brio to fire a laser beam that can destroy the Cortex Vortex.|$|E
5|$|Scattered {{throughout}} {{each level}} are {{various types of}} crates, most of which contain items such as Wumpa Fruit and Aku Aku masks, {{which can be broken}} by jumping on or spinning into them. Other types of crate include checkpoint crates, which lets players resume their progress after losing a life, arrow crates which Crash can bounce on, and explosive TNT crates that explode upon being broken, or following a timer that activates by jumping on them. Certain crates, including steel platform crates, are invisible, requiring the player to hit an exclamation box to make them tangible. If the player clears a level with all crates broken without dying, they will earn <b>a</b> <b>gem.</b> Additional gems can be obtained through hidden levels or alternate routes, and some gems are required to access new areas. Collecting all gems in the game allows the player to reach its true ending. If the player manages to collect enough bonus icons, they will be warped to a Bonus Stage which, upon completion, will allow the player to save their progress, either via memory card or password.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins as}} Professor E. Gadd completes his newest {{invention}} {{of a time}} machine powered by <b>a</b> <b>gem</b> called the Cobalt Star, which is presented at Peach's Castle. Peach enters the time machine into the past, but fails to return, only leaving {{a member of an}} alien species known only as the Shroobs within the damaged time machine. The Mushroom Kingdom of the past had actually been invaded by the Shroobs, with Peach being kidnapped and held hostage at her castle. After defeating the monster, a time hole opens, leaving a passageway into the past. While searching for Peach, Mario and Luigi locate their younger selves, and agree to locate the crystal shards, which are remnants of the Cobalt Star which had been shattered during Peach's journey. Unwittingly, the brothers collect all of the shards, while being pestered by Baby Bowser (Bowser in the past) who wants the Cobalt Star. At the end, they restore the Cobalt Star only to unleash the Elder Princess Shroob, who serves as the game's final boss character. The story ends when she is defeated, Peach is rescued, and the past returns to normal.|$|E

5|$|The most {{familiar}} uses of diamonds today are as gemstones used for adornment, a use which dates back into antiquity, and as industrial abrasives for cutting hard materials. The dispersion of white light into spectral colors {{is the primary}} gemological characteristic of gem diamonds. In the 20th century, experts in gemology developed methods of grading diamonds and other gemstones based on the characteristics most important to their value as <b>a</b> <b>gem.</b> Four characteristics, known informally as the four Cs, are now commonly used as the basic descriptors of diamonds: these are carat (its weight), cut (quality of the cut is graded according to proportions, symmetry and polish), color (how close to white or colorless; for fancy diamonds how intense is its hue), and clarity (how free is it from inclusions). A large, flawless diamond {{is known as a}} paragon.|$|E
5|$|As the game's {{emphasis}} is on stealth, players are encouraged to focus on concealment, evasion, distraction, misdirection, and subtle takedowns, rather than on outright confrontation; the player's character can engage in sword-based combat when the need arises, and can perform three different attacks as well as parrying, but has limited proficiency and damage resistance in such circumstances. To do so, players must remain aware of their surroundings. To assist them in remaining hidden, a special meter on the heads-up display (HUD), {{in the form of}} <b>a</b> <b>gem,</b> helps to indicates the player's visibility to NPCs; the brighter it is, the more easier they can be visually detected, thus sticking to dark, shady spots where the gem dims, ensures the player is hidden, though NPCs can still find them if they get to close in front of them. To remain quiet, players must be careful of how much noise they produce, as well as what surfaces they are moving over; walking on soft surfaces like carpets and grass, is preferable as footsteps remain quiet, compared to walking over metal floors and ceramic tiles, which produce a lot of noise. NPCs also produce noise, either from whistling, or walking about for example, which can help player's determine where how far away they are to their own position. Noise can be used by the player to mislead/distract NPCs, such as throwing an object to lure them elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|As {{in other}} fields, not many ancient artists' names are known from {{literary}} sources, although some gems are signed. According to Pliny, Pyrgoteles {{was the only}} artist allowed to carve gems for the seal rings of Alexander the Great. Most {{of the most famous}} Roman artists were Greeks, like Dioskurides, who is thought to have produced the Gemma Augustea, and is recorded as the artist of the matching signet rings of Augustus – very carefully controlled, they allowed orders to be issued in his name by his most trusted associates. Other works survive signed by him (rather more than are all likely to be genuine), and his son Hyllos was also <b>a</b> <b>gem</b> engraver.|$|E
25|$|Sir William Crookes, <b>a</b> <b>gem</b> {{connoisseur}} {{as well as}} {{a chemist}} and physicist, was the first to discover radiation's effects on diamond color when in 1904 he conducted a series of experiments using radium salts. Diamonds enveloped in radium salt slowly turned a dark green; this color was found to be localized in blotchy patches, and it did not penetrate past the surface of the stone. The emission of alpha particles by the radium was responsible. Unfortunately radium treatment also left the diamond strongly radioactive, {{to the point of being}} unwearable. A diamond octahedron so treated was donated by Crookes to the British Museum in 1914, where it remains today: it has lost neither its color nor radioactivity.|$|E
