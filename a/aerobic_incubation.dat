The results showed that the N-mineralization capability and capacity using the two incubation methods were evidently different. After 217 days, cumulative mineralized N, the decreased amounts of total acid-hydrolyzable N, acid-hydrolyzable ammonia N, and acid-hydrolyzable amino acid N in the water-logged incubation were about twice those in the <b>aerobic</b> <b>incubation.</b> Soluble organic N leached in the <b>aerobic</b> <b>incubation</b> was four times that in the water-logged incubation, which implied that organic N in the <b>aerobic</b> <b>incubation</b> mineralized more thoroughly than that in the water-logged incubation. The correlation analysis of the changes of soil organic N forms with crop N uptake showed that the reduced amount of total acid-hydrolyzable N in the water-logged incubation was closely associated with total N uptake by two successive-season crops (winter wheat and summer maize), and the decreased amounts of total acid-hydrolyzable N and amino acid N in the <b>aerobic</b> <b>incubation</b> were highly significantly related to the N uptake of both the first season crop (winter wheat) and successive-season maize. Multiple regression analysis, path analysis, and partial correlation analysis of the changes of soil organic N forms with mineralized N indicated that ammonia N was a main contribution to mineralized N in the water-logged incubation, whereas both acid-hydrolyzable amino acid and ammonia N were main contributions to mineralized N in the <b>aerobic</b> <b>incubation.</b> These results suggested that acid-hydrolyzable ammonia was the primary contribution to mineralized N during N mineralization process with the two incubation methods...|$|E

When grown anaerobically {{in the presence}} of sodium carbonate (or bicarbonate for a few strains), few amino acids were required. All strains tested required cystine (or cystine) as a nutrient. Three strains (S. mutans OMZ- 176, FA- 1, and BHT) required glutamate (and/or glutamine). A third amino acid (lysine for S. mutans FA- 1 and histidine for S. mutans OMZ- 176) was required by two of the three strains which required glutamate. The amino acids mentioned above were required for all conditions of incubation (and inoculum) tested. The requirements for several other amino acids were conditional, that is, dependent on the incubation conditions and inoculum used. For example, when carbonate was not added, glutamate was required by S. mutans GS- 5. <b>Aerobic</b> <b>incubations,</b> with carbonate or bicarbonate added, resluted in requirements for glutamate and leucine by several strains.

Incubations were conducted at multiple temperatures, which were combined based on degree days (DD). Soil water was maintained at 60 % waterfilled pore space (WFPS; constant) or allowed to fluctuate between 60 and 30 % WFPS (cycle). Soil subsamples were removed periodically and extracted in 2 M potassium chloride (KCl); nitrate (NO 3) and ammonium (NH 4) concentrations in extracts were determined colorimetrically. For each location, the rate of soil organic-matter N (SOMN) mineralization was estimated by regressing soil inorganic N (Ni) concentration on DD, using a linear (zero-order) model. When all data were included, the mineralization rate from four datasets was not statistically different, with a rate equivalent to 0. 5 mg N kg- 1 soil day- 1. Soil incubated at two locations exhibited significantly higher SOMN mineralization rates.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of soil organic matter (SOM) in C storage and provision of ecosystem services, the magnitude {{and direction of the}} response of SOM to climate change remains debated. Particularly contested is the role of biochemical recalcitrance in determining the biological stability of SOM, which in turn, may also vary with climate. Employing a climosequence study design controlling for confounding pedogenic factors, the research described in this thesis aimed to uncover the response of both SOM chemistry and SOM biological stability to changes in climate and associated land use shifts at the grassland-forest ecotone in west-central Saskatchewan. Characterization of SOM chemistry was achieved using two advanced analytical techniques: X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy and pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectrometry (Py-FIMS). Agreements between XANES and Py-FIMS revealed only minor differences in SOM chemistry resulting from a 0. 7 °C mean annual temperature (MAT) gradient and associated broad differences in land use, but revealed a clear influence of depth within soil profiles.

40|$|Suspension-feeding eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica, {{were once}} {{abundant}} in Chesapeake Bay and may then have exerted top-down control on phytoplankton and also reduced turbidities, thereby increasing light available to benthic plants. Alternatively, oysters may have simply recycled inorganic nutrients rapidly {{back to the}} water column, with no long-lasting reduction in phytoplankton biomass resulting from oyster feeding activity. To help distinguish between these scenarios, we explored changes in nitrogen fluxes and denitrification in laboratory incubations of sediment cores held under oxic and anoxic conditions in response to loading by pelletized phytoplankton cells, an experimental analog for oyster feces and pseudofeces. When organics were regenerated under aerobic conditions, typical of those associated with oyster habitat, coupled nitrification–denitrification was promoted, resulting in denitrification of � 20 % of the total added nitrogen. In contrast, under anoxic conditions, typical of current summertime conditions in main-stem Chesapeake Bay where phytoplankton is microbially degraded beneath the pycnocline, nitrogen was released solely as ammonium from the added organics.

Soil samples were collected from the upper 15 cm of undisturbed grasslands since 1880, from undisturbed grasslands since 1931, and from cultivated fields since 1880 in the western United States. We found three distinct groups of organosulfur compounds in these grassland-derived soils: (i) strongly reduced (S 0 to S 1 +) organic S that encompasses thiols, monosulfides, disulfides, polysulfides, and thiophenes; (ii) organic S in intermediate oxidation (S 2 + to S 5 +) states, which include sulfoxides and sulfonates; and (iii) strongly oxidized (S 6 +) organic S, which comprises ester SO 4 S. The first two groups represent S directly linked to C and accounted for 80 % of the total organic S detected by XANES from the undisturbed soils. <b>Aerobic</b> <b>incubation</b> without the addition of sugarcane residue led to a 21 % decline in organanosulfur compounds directly linked to C and to up to an 82 % increase inorganic S directly bonded to O. Among the C-bonded S compounds, low-valence thiols, sulfides, thiophenic S, and intermediate-valence sulfoxide S seem to be highly susceptible to microbial attack and may represent the most reactive components of organic S pool in these grassland soils.

However, similar to soils incubated without residue addition, the proportion of organic S directly linked to C continued to decline with increasing duration of <b>aerobic</b> <b>incubation,</b> whereas the proportion of organic S directly bonded to O showed a steady rise...|$|E
40|$|The Herman Pit, once a mercury mine, is an {{impoundment}} {{located in}} an active geothermal area. Its acidic waters are permeated by hundreds of gas seeps. One seep was sampled and found to be composed of mostly CO 2 with some CH 4 present. The δ 13 CH 4 value suggested a complex origin for the methane: i. e., a thermogenic component plus a biological methanogenic portion. The relatively 12 C-enriched CO 2 suggested a reworking of the ebullitive methane by methanotrophic bacteria. Therefore, we tested bottom sediments {{for their ability to}} consume methane by conducting <b>aerobic</b> <b>incubations</b> of slurried materials. Methane was removed from the headspace of live slurries, and subsequent additions of methane resulted in faster removal rates. This activity could be transferred to an artificial, acidic medium, indicating the presence of acidophilic or acid-tolerant methanotrophs, the latter reinforced by the observation of maximum activity at pH = 4. 5 with incubated slurries. A successful extraction of sterol and hopanoid lipids characteristic of methanotrophs was achieved, and their abundances greatly increased with increased sediment methane consumption. DNA extracted from methane-oxidizing enrichment cultures was amplified and sequenced for pmoA genes that aligned with methanotrophic members of the Gammaproteobacteria. An enrichment culture was established that grew in an acidic (pH 4. 5) medium via methane oxidation...|$|R
40|$|An {{automated}} turbidimeter {{for measuring}} bacterial growth in ordinary test tubes is described. The device records and prints adsorbance, expressed as Klett units, of 60 cultures every 15 min. Provision {{is made for}} either <b>aerobic</b> or anaerobic <b>incubation.</b> The device is adaptable to modification, depending upon local requirements and availability of computation facilities...|$|R
40|$|In two soil types {{small amounts}} of α-hexachlorocyclohexane were formed from γ-hexachlorocyclohexane under {{submerged}} conditions, but not under aerobic conditions. In the submerged soils γ-tetrachlorocyclohexene was detected as a major metabolite of γ-hexachlorocyclohexane, whereas <b>aerobic</b> soil <b>incubation</b> yielded γ-pentachlorocyclohexene. Growing cultures of Escherichia coli produced α-hexachlorocyclohexane from the γ-isomer only upon anaerobic incubation. Moreover, heavy, washed suspensions of E. coli incubated anaerobically with γ-hexachlorocyclohexane (7. 5 mg/liter) in a glucose-phosphate buffer medium converted 1. 6 % of the γ-hexachlorocyclohexane into the α-isomer in 10 days. Growing mycelia of Aspergillus niger incubated with γ-hexachlorocyclohexane produced no α-isomer...|$|R
