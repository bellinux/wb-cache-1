50|$|A licence {{will contain}} {{one or more}} ratings. These are sub-qualifications that specify in more detail the exact {{privileges}} that the licence conveys. One type of rating is an <b>Aircraft</b> <b>rating.</b> This specifies the type or types of aircraft which can be flown, and is either a Class rating, when a whole broad class of aircraft can be flown, or a Type rating where the privileges are confined to a single type or group of very closely related types. The very basic <b>aircraft</b> <b>rating</b> usually obtained by PPL(A) holders at their initial skills test is the Single Engine Piston Landplane (SEP-land) Class Rating. This allows flight of single-piston-engined, non-turbocharged, fixed-pitch propeller, fixed tricycle gear, non-pressurised land aeroplanes (with a few exceptions). SEP class rating holders may optionally extend the privileges of this rating to cover complex features by taking formal differences training from a suitably qualified instructor. There are five categories of difference: tailwheel aircraft, retractable undercarriage, variable-pitch propeller, turbocharged engine and cabin pressurisation. There is no formal test for any difference training; the training is signed off as satisfactorily completed in the pilot's logbook by the instructor conducting the training. Other class ratings include Multi Engine Piston (MEP) landplane, Single and Multi engined piston Seaplane, Single Engine Turbine (SET) and Touring Motor Gliders. Note: There is no MET class rating, as multi engine turbine and all jet powered aircraft require a type rating. To add these to their licence a pilot has to undergo a course of training and pass an additional skills test. Differences training is also required for certain complex features within these class ratings. Aircraft ratings are type-specific for multi engine turboprop & all jet aircraft {{and for a few}} other very complex types. To obtain one of these a pilot must undergo specific training and pass a skills test. It is also possible to obtain permission from the CAA to fly an aircraft not covered by any type or class rating.|$|E

25|$|When {{an engine}} on a multi-engine {{aircraft}} fails, the thrust distribution on the aircraft becomes asymmetrical, {{resulting in a}} yawing moment {{in the direction of}} the failed engine. A sideslip develops, causing the total drag of the aircraft to increase considerably, resulting in a drop in the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>rate</b> of climb. The rudder, and to a certain extent the ailerons via the use of bank angle, are the only aerodynamic controls available to the pilot to counteract the asymmetrical thrust yawing moment.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis is {{an analysis of}} the flight hour cost program at the Pacific Missile Test Center (PMTC). The method by which PMTC computes <b>aircraft</b> flight hour <b>rates</b> is compared to the techniques used by the Naval Air Test Center and the Naval Weapons Center. A new approach to computing <b>aircraft</b> <b>rates</b> is proposed in this report. Using historical cost data, regression analysis is used to derive a rate per hour flown for fuel consumption. Based upon these data, no correlation exists between aircraft flight hours and aircraft parts costs. A decision support system (DSS) is also proposed herein to assist in the calculation of the flight hour rates. This DSS can also be used as a budget and as a vehicle to track program cost and schedule variances. It is recommended that a follow-on analysis be conducted to ascertain whether or not a true correlation exists between flight hours and aircraft parts costs. Under the current budget system, funds for parts are requested per hour in the Navy and Marine Corp flying hour program. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Flight {{testing is}} the {{preferred}} means of obtaining accurate, locally linear, dynamic models of nonlinear aircraft dynamics. In this paper, decoupled longitudinal and lat-eral/directional linear dynamic models of an unmanned air vehicle are identified using the Observer/Kalman Filter Identification method. This method is a time-domain technique that identifies a discrete input-output mapping from known input and output data samples. The method is developed for flight testing, including details of instrumentation, measure-ments, and data post-processing techniques such as nonlinear estimation. Multiple flight tests were conducted, and experimental examples for longitudinal and lateral/directional dynamics are presented, including the model selection process. Fidelity of the identified lin-ear models to the nonlinear plant is validated by comparing measured and model predicted outputs with measured inputs from flight test. Mean squared errors and the Theil informa-tion coefficient are used as accuracy metrics. Results presented in the paper demonstrate that the linear models reproduced from flight test results are acceptable representations of the nonlinear aircraft dynamics in the cruise configuration.
