These two national apexes are the Dyna-Enterprises Project and the Small Entrepreneurs Loan Facility (SELF) project, which are functioning in Senegal and Tanzania respectively. Both Dyna and SELF initially started as small-scale apex MFIs and had been conceived with the same vision in mind - facilitation of access to financial services for the poor. The initial implementation focused on provision of credit through MFIs as well as capacity building. The targeted groups of clients are similar, i. e. the disadvantaged, and mostly are women groups in urban or peri-urban areas carrying out general petty trade activities. Like many <b>apex</b> <b>institutions</b> in sub-Saharan Africa, both SELF and Dyna have stimulated demand for more financial support {{to the poor and}} have shown potential to be transformed into viable commercial MFIs. This entails expansion in terms of increased number of staff, branches, cost-effective microfinance services, the number and quality of financial products, capacity building, outreach and information services.

After giving the background of the microfinance crisis, we provide evidence of the need for a more responsible microfinance industry. Thereafter, we examine the state of Islamic microfinance around the world and in the Arab world and focus on two existing apex institutions for microfinance: a conventional one – Social Fund for Development (SFD) in Yemen and an Islamic one – Sudan Microfinance Development Facility (SMDF). We conduct a comparison based on outreach to final beneficiaries and total outstanding loan portfolio. The outcome of our assessment, restricted to limited data, shows that SMDF performs better than SFD suggesting that Islamic microfinance apex institutions have potentially a greater impact. We conclude by saying that Islamic finance industry practitioners should make efforts towards developing the microfinance space, as microfinance clients, as they become bankable, will form the basis of loyal depositors to mainstream Islamic financial institutions...|$|E

40|$|Farmer cooperatives {{are viewed}} as {{mechanisms}} to help improve the marketing environment for poor rural farmers faced with limited and uncertain consumer demand for the goods they produce. Cooperatives can help reduce production costs by organizing bulk input purchases for their members. They may {{also be used as}} social organizations and serve as a medium for enlightenment and capacity building. This brief explores the role of farmers ’ cooperatives in Nigeria by assessing their effectiveness in marketing and traceability services, as well as elucidating the constraints they face. Background In 1922, the first Nigerian cooperative was formed as the cocoa fermenting scheme. 1 The rules guiding this scheme were formalized in 1928, and in 1934, the existing primary societies formed into a union. Since then, various types of cooperatives have emerged in Nigeria, including farmer or agricultural cooperatives, cooperative building societies, crafts and artisan societies, and consumer cooperatives. Cooperatives are useful in overcoming access barriers to assets, information, services, and markets for high-value products; they also assist some Nigerian small-scale farmers in solving land, labor, and capital problems. (Nweke 1979 and Holloway et al 2000) The organizational structures of cooperative societies are based on the nature of their membership, functions, and services. Nigerian cooperatives are usually arranged into three tiers: primary (village associations, community-based organizations, farmer’s groups. and other cooperative societies of individuals), secondary (unions of different cooperative societies), and apex (federations of cooperative unions). The Cooperative Federation of Nigeria is thus the <b>apex</b> <b>institution</b> of all cooperative societies in Nigeria; while the Famers ’ Development Union and the Cocoa Farmer Association are examples of secondary and primary cooperatives respectively. 1 The discussion in this note is limited to formal cooperatives and excludes village associations and other informal groups. Methodology This brief is largely based on a review of literature, supplemented by data collected in July 2010 through structured key informant interviews (KII) with executive members of the Cooperativ...|$|E

Professor Azinge has previously served as the Special Assistant to the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice where he served from 1991 to 1997, and {{as a member of}} Nigeria’s legal team at the International Court of Justice in the so-called Bakkasi Case (Cameroon v. Nigeria). He holds the PhD (1986) and LLM (1983) degrees from the University of London and an LL. B in the Second Class Upper Division from the University of Lagos (1976). He was called to the Nigerian bar in 1980. His specializations are in comparative constitutional law, public law, and shipping law. His doctoral thesis was on “Electoral Laws in Nigeria”. The progression of his educational attainment has clearly portrayed a path of brilliance and excellence that his professional career has also been known for. A talented educationist and administrator, Professor Azinge began his career as an academic at the University of Benin in 1981. As a lecturer in law, and later a professor of law, he taught several courses in a wide diversity of areas. He has also engaged in LLM and Ph. D thesis supervision. He has held several administrative positions including service as Assistant Dean of the Faculty of Law, University of Benin and membership of the University Senate of the same institution. His innovative and dynamic stewardship {{in the last five years}} as the Director General of the Institute has demonstrated sterling performance much to his credit and has brought an enhanced international and local profile to the Institute. For e. g, during his five-year tenure as Director General, the Institute has produced over 63 books and journals. It was during his tenure that a PhD programme in Legislative drafting was introduced at the Institute; the first ever free online pro-bono law clinic in the whole of the African continent was launched; and its E-learning and Distance Learning, Judicial Performance Evaluation, Restatement of Customary Law in Nigeria and the Traditional Administration of Justice, Political Financing, Nigerian Law Faculties Annual Ranking, and eleven other innovative projects, were introduced. It was also due in part to his remarkable receptiveness and dynamism that the current Osgoode/NIALS Partnership Development project (funded by the SSHRC) was instituted. This project, hosted by the Nathanson Centre, has thus far led to two years of intensive research collaboration and exchanges between some Osgoode-based scholars and students and many of their equivalents at NIALS.

40|$|The Parliament Secretariat of Sri Lanka {{being one}} of the country’s <b>apex</b> <b>institutions,</b> its {{employees}} are expected to execute their duties at a high standard. However, there are evidences to conclude the fact that the institutional performance is far below the expected level. With the view of improving this situation, the Secretariat has initiated several measures such as ad-hoc salary increments, promotions, etc; however, instead of improving the performance, such measures have further deteriorated the situation. In this backdrop, a macro analysis was conducted to study the institutional context, for which two contemporary techniques namely external & internal audit were undertaken. The external audit unearthed the opportunities the institution may capitalize on and the threats the institution must cope with in order to achieve envisaged institutional objectives. In contrast, the internal audit unearthed the internal strengths and weaknesses in terms of institutional culture, business practices, resource management, etc. The information collected through diverse channels prompt that the poor performance management practices have greatly attributed to the present ‘fragile status’. To justify this argument, more specific information were collected via several techniques such as interviews, brainstorming, questionnaire, etc. The analyses of the collected information revealed that the institutional performance management practices are weak and incongruent with the business objectives. To overcome such weaknesses and to exploit opportunities identified, a new performance management tool namely Employee Development Review (EDR) was developed, for which Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has been fully utilized. In terms of implementation, EDR was phased out and a pilot project has been implemented in one of the departments...|$|R
