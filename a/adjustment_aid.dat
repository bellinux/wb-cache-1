40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to explore some of the ways that {{possessions}} may be used symbolically to <b>aid</b> <b>adjustment</b> in first-semester freshmen who are transitioning to college. Based on prior literature, the transition to college is often accompanied by self-discrepancies which may be alleviated through symbolic self-completion using possessions. Overall, 219 students participated in this study. Results indicate that first-semester freshmen, as well as upperclassmen students, rely on the symbolic use of possessions in both managing negative affect and symbolizing the ideal college student identity. Furthermore, managing affect through the use of feeling regulators was found to best <b>aid</b> <b>adjustment</b> early in the transition, while symbolizing the college identity through the use of identity claims was found to better <b>aid</b> <b>adjustment</b> later in the transition. In addition, the importance of the college student identity was found to moderate this relationship.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of house prices poses significant conceptual and practical problems, mainly because dwellings are heterogeneous assets whose prices {{can only be}} observed when they are sold. There are now seven main house price indices for the United Kingdom. In broad terms, each measures one of three different concepts: {{the value of a}} representative set of house transactions; the price of a house with “typical ” characteristics; the value of the housing stock. The indices are constructed from different data using different methods. Consequently, the available measures of house prices can give conflicting or misleading signals about house price inflation. The data and methods used to construct the indices can vary in three key respects: the point in the house purchase process at which the price is measured; the techniques used to adjust for differences in the characteristics of houses; and the weighting scheme used. Indices that measure the price earlier in the purchase process are able to detect price changes first, but will measure final prices with error because prices can be renegotiated extensively before the deal is finalised. This is not necessarily a disadvantage, because it is useful to have a measure of prices at each stage of the purchasing process and those indices measuring prices earlier in the purchase process may lead other indices. Quality <b>adjustment</b> <b>aids</b> interpretation of price changes, and can have significant effects on measure...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{properties}} of simple quantity-based monetary policy rules {{in the face of}} external volatility in low-income African economies.

We find {{the properties of}} these rules are robust to assumptions about the degree of integration of the domestic bond market with world capital markets.

In this research, we propose {{a combination of a}} digital camera and a small (cheap) laser scanner with inexpensive IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for unmanned air vehicles. 3 D shape is acquired by laser scanner as point cloud data, and texture is acquired by CCD sensor from the same platform simultaneously.

In order to represent 3 D space in details, it is indispensable to acquire 3 D shape and texture together efficiently. However, there still lack a reliable, quick, cheap and handy method of acquiring three {{dimensional data}} of objects at higher resolution and accuracy in outdoor and moving environments. In this research, we propose {{a combination of a}} digital camera and a small (cheap) laser scanner with inexpensive IMU and GPS for an unmanned helicopter. Direct geo-referencing is achieved automatically using all the sensors without any ground control points. After the accurate trajectory of the platform with attitude changes are determined through the direct geo-referencing, 3 D shape of objects is determined by laser scanner as 3 D point cloud data, while texture is acquired by CCD sensor from the same platform simultaneously. A method of direct geo-referencing of range data and CCD images by integrating multi sensors for constructing digital surface model are focused. While measuring, an unmanned helicopter is continuously changing its position and attitude with respect to time. For direct geo-referencing, IMU measures the movement of the platform. IMU has a rising quality, but it is still affected by systematic errors. Through Kalman filter operation, an optimal estimate of the sensor position and attitude are determined from GPS and IMU. Meanwhile, geo-referencing of CCD image is determined by bundle block adjustment. GPS and IMU allow automatic setting of tie-points and they reduce the number of tie-points and searching time of tie-points by limiting of searching area.

40|$|Background: Hearing loss {{can affect}} {{approximately}} 15 % of the pediatric population {{and up to}} 40 % of the adult population. The gold standard of treatment for hearing loss is amplification of hearing thresholds {{by means of a}} hearing aid instrument. A hearing aid is an electronic device equipped with a topology of only three major components of aggregate cost. The gold standard of hearing aid fittings is face-to-face appointments in hearing aid centers, clinics, or hospitals. Telefitting encompasses the programming and <b>adjustments</b> of hearing <b>aid</b> settings remotely. Fitting hearing aids remotely is a relatively simple procedure, using minimal computer hardware and Internet access.

Yet, how population density (and associated social behaviors) affects physiological functions like metabolism is poorly understood in insects. Additionally, insects often show marked sexual dimorphism (larger females). Thus, in this study on D. melanogaster, we characterized the effects of fly density and sex on both mass-specific routine oxygen consumption (V̇O 2) and hypoxia tolerance (PCrit). Females had significantly lower routine V̇O 2 (∼ 4  µl O 2  mg− 1  h− 1) than males (∼ 6  µl O 2  mg− 1  h− 1) at an average fly density of 28 flies·respirometer chamber− 1.

Harbour traffic may be busy and the waterways congested, both by the major shipping and by the attendant harbour tugs. The harbour channel may be narrow and tortuous, and rapidly changing tides may require frequent course <b>adjustments.</b> Navigation <b>aids</b> must be clearly specified and immediately identifiable, in order to permit safe passage for the vessels. This requires a GIS with attributes not easily available with traditional products. The GeoVS system is a kinetic GIS with full three-dimensional visualisation, so that ships, bathymetry and landscape may be viewed {{in a form that}} is immediately understandable to both harbour pilots and the harbour authority. The system is kinetic because the data structures used to preserve the topological relationships between ships, seafloor and coastline are able to be maintained on a real-time basis, taking account of ship movement recorded on the compulsory AIS (Automatic Information System) beacons. Maintenance of this real-time topology allows for easy detection of potential collisions, as well as real-time bathymetric estimations, necessary to prevent ship grounding in highly tidal environments. The system, based on previous research into kinetic Voronoi diagrams, as well as development of a completely new graphical engine, is now in commercial production, where its advantages over simpler twodimensional models without automatic collision and grounding detection are becoming evident. Other applications are readily envisaged, and will be addressed in the near future...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} the 'Hertfordshire Colour-blind Emulator' (HCBE) software application. Currently, our {{aim is to}} raise awareness of the challenges that the colour-blind encounter on their learning journey. HCBE emulates four major types of colour-blindness: protanopia, deuteranopia, tritanopia and monochromacy. HCBE accepts an image file and outputs that image in the way that a colour-blind learner would see the original inputted image. For any inputted images there are four options for outputted images, one for each colour-blind type. Colour-blindness is often considered to be a mild disability where, on the whole, a colour-blind learner has developed his/her own ???coping mechanisms??? to avoid, but not to eliminate, problems in their learning. The problems faced by some colour-blind users of online games have recently been highlighted in the research, this paper identifies some of the issues for students in their learning. The Equality Act 2010 places the responsibility of making reasonable <b>adjustments</b> to <b>aid</b> the disabled on the educational practitioner by providing legal rights for disabled people, irrespective of the severity of the disability.
