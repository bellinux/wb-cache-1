50|$|Taxes {{are imposed}} on {{net income of}} {{individuals}} and corporations by the federal, most state, and some local governments. Citizens and residents are taxed on worldwide income and allowed a credit for foreign taxes. Income subject to tax is determined under tax accounting rules, not financial accounting principles, and includes almost all income from whatever source. Most business expenses reduce taxable income, though limits apply to a few expenses. Individuals are permitted to reduce taxable income by personal <b>allowances</b> <b>and</b> certain non-business <b>expenses,</b> including home mortgage interest, state and local taxes, charitable contributions, and medical <b>and</b> certain other <b>expenses</b> incurred above certain percentages of income. State rules for determining taxable income often differ from federal rules. Federal tax rates vary from 10% to 39.6% of taxable income. State and local tax rates vary widely by jurisdiction, from 0% to 13.30% of income, and many are graduated. State taxes are generally treated as a deductible expense for federal tax computation. In 2013, the top marginal income tax rate for a high-income California resident would be 52.9%.|$|R

5000|$|In early 2009, a major {{political}} scandal was triggered by the leaking and subsequent publication of expense claims made {{by members of the}} United Kingdom Parliament. On 16 July 2010, Taylor resigned the Tory Whip after being charged with offences connected with claims totalling £11,277. Several hundred members of the House of Commons and House of Lords were involved in the expenses scandal but only six members of the House of Commons and two, including Taylor, of the Lords, were charged and convicted. Taylor's defence in the Crown Court was that on appointment to the House of Lords he had asked other peers for advice on <b>expenses</b> <b>and</b> <b>allowances</b> <b>and</b> that he was told that the overnight subsistence allowance, the office <b>allowance,</b> <b>and</b> the travel <b>expenses</b> were provided in lieu of a salary, as well as the daily attendance allowance. As a result of claiming for the cost of journeys he had not made, and the cost of accommodation he had not occupied, Taylor was convicted of six counts of false accounting. In his summing up to the jury, Mr Justice Saunders observed that Taylor was a man of good character who had devoted {{a lot of time to}} helping others. The judge imposed a sentence of 12 months imprisonment, relating to £11,277 in falsely claimed expenses. He said that the expenses scandal had [...] "left an indelible stain on Parliament". About 15 members of the House of Lords had refused to give evidence to support Taylor's defence.|$|R

40|$|Assistant Professor of Accounting- King Saud University- Riyadh, ** Assistant Professor of Accounting- Institute of Public Administration- RiyadhThis study aims at {{analyzing}} {{the characteristics of}} Zakat and tax objections in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The study reveals that the current objection mechanism leads to increasing {{the time needed to}} settle the objections. It shows that the objections in general take 1117 days on average to be settled. The study finds Zakat objections require more time for settlement (1338 days) comparing with tax objections (844 days). This finding reflects the fact that the Zakat objection settlement requires reviewing many different Islamic constitutional approaches that could be applicable to it. The study also shows that the average amount of the objections reviewed by the First Instance Committee reaches 48, 479, 878 Saudi Riyals. This shows the importance of quick settlement of these objections to expedite benefiting from potentially large outstanding amounts. In addition, the study shows that the most recurring Zakat objection items are as follows: investments, provisions <b>and</b> <b>allowances,</b> administrative <b>and</b> general <b>expenses,</b> fixed assets <b>and</b> depreciation and loss carry forward respectively. On the other hand, the most recurrent tax objection items are related to: head office <b>expenses</b> <b>and</b> technical services performed abroad, pension expenses paid abroad, administrative <b>and</b> general <b>expenses,</b> employees’ benefits <b>and</b> revenue recognition respectively. The results of this study stress the importance of improving the objection mechanism in order to expedite the objection settlement. The results could open the door to future research aiming at formulating suitable treatments for the most recurring objections. In addition, the findings should appeal to Zakat and tax authorities, in that the evidence presented in this study will help Zakat and tax authorities in their efforts to enhance the objection process in its procedural and objective aspects...|$|R
