5|$|Apart from pit-trap-forming taxa, {{the biology}} {{of members of the}} family Myrmeleontidae, to which the antlions belong, has been little studied. The {{life-cycle}} begins with oviposition (egg-laying) in a suitable location. The female antlion repeatedly taps the prospective laying site with the tip of her <b>abdomen</b> <b>and</b> then inserts her ovipositor into the substrate and lays an egg.|$|E
5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders are coelomates {{in which}} the coelom is reduced to small areas round the {{reproductive}} and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a hemocoel, a cavity that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows. The heart is a tube in {{the upper part of the}} body, with a few ostia that act as non-return valves allowing blood to enter the heart from the hemocoel but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front end. However, in spiders, it occupies only the upper part of the <b>abdomen,</b> <b>and</b> blood is discharged into the hemocoel by one artery that opens at the rear end of the <b>abdomen</b> <b>and</b> by branching arteries that pass through the pedicle and open into several parts of the cephalothorax. Hence spiders have open circulatory systems. The blood of many spiders that have book lungs contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin to make oxygen transport more efficient.|$|E
5|$|Anatomically, spiders {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} {{in that the}} usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax and <b>abdomen,</b> <b>and</b> joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel. Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae. In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax. Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure.|$|E
50|$|It {{comprises}} a head, neck, trunk (which {{includes the}} thorax <b>and</b> <b>abdomen),</b> arms <b>and</b> hands, legs and feet.|$|R
50|$|They {{are known}} for their habit of raising their long <b>abdomens</b> <b>and</b> opening their jaws, like a {{threatened}} scorpion. In this defense posture, they secrete an irritating substance, with a very unpleasant smell.|$|R
50|$|Antennae in {{both sexes}} black, sparsely {{sprinkled}} with white dots; head, thorax <b>and</b> <b>abdomen</b> above <b>and</b> below white: thorax above often bluish grey.|$|R
5|$|Aquatic beetles use several {{techniques}} for retaining air beneath the water's surface. Diving beetles (Dytiscidae) hold air between the <b>abdomen</b> <b>and</b> the elytra when diving. Hydrophilidae have hairs on their under surface that retain {{a layer of}} air against their bodies. Adult crawling water beetles use both their elytra and their hind coxae (the basal segment of the back legs) in air retention, while whirligig beetles simply carry an air bubble down with them whenever they dive.|$|E
5|$|Billy Clanton {{was shot}} in the wrist, chest and <b>abdomen,</b> <b>and</b> after a minute or two slumped to a sitting {{position}} near his original position {{at the corner of the}} MacDonald house in the lot between the house and Fly's Lodging House. Claiborne said Clanton was supported by a window initially after he was shot, and fired some shots after sitting, with the pistol supported on his leg. After he ran out of ammunition, he called for more cartridges, but C. S. Fly took his pistol at about the time the general shooting ended.|$|E
5|$|Czolgosz {{had lost}} his job during the {{economic}} Panic of 1893 and turned to anarchism, a political philosophy adhered to by recent killers of foreign leaders. Regarding McKinley {{as a symbol of}} oppression, Czolgosz was convinced that it was his duty as an anarchist to kill him. Unable to get near the President during the presidential visit earlier, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice as the President reached to shake his hand in the reception line at the temple. One bullet grazed McKinley; the other entered his <b>abdomen</b> <b>and</b> was never found.|$|E
50|$|Females can be {{distinguished}} from males by their wider <b>abdomens</b> <b>and</b> smaller second pereiopods. The genital openings are found on the body segments containing the fifth pereiopods and the third pereiopods in males and females, respectively.|$|R
50|$|Antennae black, {{speckled}} with white; head, thorax <b>and</b> <b>abdomen</b> above black <b>and</b> beneath white.|$|R
25|$|P. sericea {{individuals}} are medium sized wasps, about 17nbsp&mm long. They are dark in color, {{and tend to}} be slow-flying and docile, unless they are disturbed. Queens typically have larger <b>abdomens,</b> <b>and</b> smaller heads and wings than workers.|$|R
5|$|Davey had {{sustained}} {{wounds to}} his back, <b>abdomen</b> <b>and</b> legs, and was evacuated to England. After he had recovered sufficiently {{he received his}} Victoria Cross, and was then embarked to return to Australia in October. He was discharged from the AIF on 24 February 1919. His brothers Claude and Richard were also awarded the Military Medal during World War I, with Claude being killed in action in 1917.|$|E
5|$|During the retreat, Montcalm, still mounted, {{was struck}} by either {{canister}} shot from the British artillery or repeated musket fire, suffering injuries to the lower <b>abdomen</b> <b>and</b> thigh. He {{was able to make}} it back into the city, but his wounds were mortal and he died early the next morning. He was buried in a shell crater left in the floor of the Ursuline chapel by a British shell. The battle resulted in similar numbers of casualties {{on both sides of the}} field; the French had 644 men killed or injured, while the British were left with 658 killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|Governor Johnson, {{despite his}} {{presumptive}} official position, his age (50), and a crippled arm, volunteered to serve under General John C. Breckinridge and Colonel Robert P. Trabue at the Battle of Shiloh. On April 7, Johnson was severely {{wounded in the}} thigh and <b>abdomen,</b> <b>and</b> lay on the battlefield until the following day. Johnson was recognized and helped by acquaintance and fellow Freemason, Alexander McDowell McCook, a Union general. However, Johnson died aboard the Union hospital ship Hannibal, and the provisional government of Kentucky was left leaderless.|$|E
50|$|This wave {{will cause}} {{pulsation}} {{in the neck}} <b>and</b> <b>abdomen,</b> headache, cough, <b>and</b> jaw pain.|$|R
50|$|Antennae, head, thorax <b>and</b> <b>abdomen</b> {{brownish}} black, {{the shafts}} of the antennae ringed with white, the head, thorax <b>and</b> <b>abdomen</b> with some bluish pubescence; beneath: the palpi, thorax <b>and</b> <b>abdomen</b> white, the palpi fringed anteriorly with stiff black hairs.|$|R
50|$|P. sericea {{individuals}} are medium sized wasps, about 17 mm long. They are dark in color, {{and tend to}} be slow-flying and docile, unless they are disturbed. Queens typically have larger <b>abdomens,</b> <b>and</b> smaller heads and wings than workers.|$|R
5|$|In a {{makeshift}} hospital at Plateros, Scout Alfonso and Ranger Fisher were quickly put into surgery. The shrapnel {{was removed from}} Alfonso's <b>abdomen,</b> <b>and</b> {{he was expected to}} recover if returned to American lines. Fisher's shrapnel was also removed, but with limited supplies and widespread damage to both his stomach and intestines, it was decided more extensive surgery would need to be completed in an American hospital. Mucci ordered that an airstrip be built in a field next to Plateros so that a plane could airlift him to American lines. Some Scouts and freed prisoners stayed behind to construct the airstrip.|$|E
5|$|In the phlaeothripids {{that feed}} on fungi, males compete {{to protect and}} mate with females, and then defend the egg-mass. Males fight by {{flicking}} their rivals away with their <b>abdomen,</b> <b>and</b> may kill with their foretarsal teeth. Small males may sneak in to mate while the larger males are busy fighting. In the Merothripidae and in the Aeolothripidae, males are again polymorphic with large and small forms, and probably also compete for mates, so the strategy may well be ancestral among the Thysanoptera.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} found that the western cicada killer wasp is capable of {{thermoregulation}} which enables them to maintain territories during the day. A study by Joseph R. Coelho showed that during territorial patrolling the species had a high and regulated thorax temperature. Experiments found that the wasp has the ability to shift heat from its thorax to its <b>abdomen</b> <b>and</b> that the abdomen is generally kept colder than the thorax. Dead wasps that were placed in the sun reached abnormally high temperatures when compared to those on nearby plants.|$|E
50|$|The Asian rice {{gall midge}} is a fly {{about the size}} of a mosquito. The females are about 3.5 mm long, bright red, with broad <b>abdomens</b> <b>and</b> dense short hair, while the males are {{slightly}} smaller, yellowish-brown and more slender.|$|R
25|$|In a {{study that}} began {{two months after the}} {{earthquake}} and tsunami, mutant butterflies were found and are considered a possible reaction to the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Some of the butterflies had abnormalities in their legs, antennae, <b>and</b> <b>abdomens,</b> <b>and</b> dents in their eyes.|$|R
50|$|Like most New World tarantulas, they kick urticating hairs {{from their}} <b>abdomens</b> <b>and</b> their back legs if disturbed, rather than bite. They are only {{slightly}} venomous to humans and are considered extremely docile, though, {{as with all}} tarantulas, allergies may intensify with any bite.|$|R
5|$|Necrid's {{alternate}} appearance differs heavily, {{and features}} scaly, reddish–orange skin. Additional differences include teal eyes, black pants, {{and a blue}} jewel. The protruding bones are isolated and bigger on his left shoulder and arm, and appear crystalline. A pauldron covering his right shoulder is fastened to the jewel's support harness, and the armor on his legs incorporate a pair of greaves. He wears a fauld on his <b>abdomen,</b> <b>and</b> bandages wrap around his stomach. A mask covers his face and is {{held in place by}} two straps around his head.|$|E
5|$|On 11 March 2007 a {{shooting}} incident occurred at around 2.45am following {{a performance by}} Pretty Ricky at the university. A 21-year-old student at the university, who was employed as security staff at the event, received gunshot wounds to his <b>abdomen</b> <b>and</b> was taken to hospital where his condition was not believed to be life-threatening. Six others were also injured during what {{was described as a}} scuffle that broke out after CS gas (tear gas) was sprayed following the event.|$|E
5|$|Tabram {{was killed}} on 7 August 1888; she had {{suffered}} 39 stab wounds. The savagery of the murder, the lack of obvious motive, and {{the closeness of the}} location (George Yard, Whitechapel) and date to those of the later Ripper murders led police to link them. The attack differs from the canonical murders in that Tabram was stabbed rather than slashed at the throat and <b>abdomen,</b> <b>and</b> many experts do not connect it with the later murders because of the difference in the wound pattern.|$|E
50|$|Thorax greyish olive above, vertex bluish olive, <b>abdomen</b> brown; palpi <b>and</b> thorax {{in front}} <b>and</b> <b>abdomen</b> beneath, ochreous red.|$|R
50|$|In South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, {{the shapes}} of the claspers are diagnostic, as are the {{patterns}} on the thorax <b>and</b> <b>abdomen.</b> Taxonomy <b>and</b> identification of similar species further north is uncertain.|$|R
50|$|Pinheyschna subpupillata {{is similar}} to Zosteraeschna minuscula and Zosteraeschna usambarica, but the latter species have browner <b>abdomens,</b> <b>and</b> long green dorsal stripes on the thorax. The black marking on the upper frons of Zosteraeschna minuscula is shaped like an anchor, and that of Zosteraeschna usambarica like a pentagon, rather than the rounded spot of the stream hawker. Pinheyschna subpupillata males also differ in having {{secondary}} gentilia that project conspicuously from the second segment of the <b>abdomen</b> (S2), <b>and</b> lack the blue saddle (also S2) of Zosteraeschna males.|$|R
5|$|The abdomen {{consists}} of ten segments, {{some of which}} may be obscured by a large pair of operculate gills, a thoracic shield (expanded part of the prothorax) or the developing wing pads. In most taxa up to seven pairs of gills arise from the top or sides of the abdomen, but in some species they are under the <b>abdomen,</b> <b>and</b> in a very few species the gills are instead located on the coxae of the legs, or the bases of the maxillae. The abdomen terminates in a pair of, or three, slender thread-like projections.|$|E
5|$|The {{exoskeleton}} of {{the abdomen}} {{is divided into}} plates called dorsal tergites and ventral sternites. Wax is secreted from glands on the <b>abdomen</b> <b>and</b> extruded between the sternites where it resembles flakes of dandruff. It is secreted by the queen when she starts a nest and by young workers. It is scraped from the abdomen by the legs, moulded until malleable and used {{in the construction of}} honeypots, to cover the eggs, to line empty cocoons for use as storage containers and sometimes to cover the exterior of the nest.|$|E
5|$|The queen only lays 10–20 eggs in {{the very}} early stages of the colony, but lays as many as 1,000 a day when the colony is several years old. At maturity, a primary queen has a great {{capacity}} to lay eggs. In some species, the mature queen has a greatly distended <b>abdomen</b> <b>and</b> may produce 40,000 eggs a day. The two mature ovaries may have some 2,000 ovarioles each. The abdomen increases the queen's body length to several times more than before mating and reduces her ability to move freely; attendant workers provide assistance.|$|E
25|$|Atrial {{contraction}} {{against a}} closed tricuspid valve can cause pulsation {{in the neck}} <b>and</b> <b>abdomen,</b> headache, cough, <b>and</b> jaw pain.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 9-12 mm. The fore- and hindwings are {{chocolate brown}} without markings. The wings are slightly shiny at the base, the head <b>and</b> <b>abdomen</b> black, <b>and</b> the hindwings {{lighter than the}} forewings.|$|R
50|$|The antennae, head, thorax <b>and</b> <b>abdomen</b> are ochraceous brown. Beneath, the palpi, thorax <b>and</b> <b>abdomen</b> are a {{very pale}} ochraceous white.|$|R
