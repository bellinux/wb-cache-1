5|$|Concorde was {{normally}} {{perceived as}} <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> of the rich, but special circular or one-way (with return by other flight or ship) charter flights were arranged {{to bring a}} trip within the means of moderately well-off enthusiasts.|$|E
5|$|Corridors of {{the prison}} were named after major American streets such as Broadway and Michigan Avenue. Working at the prison was {{considered}} <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> for inmates {{and many of the}} better inmates were employed in the Model Industries Building and New Industries Building during the day, actively involved in providing for the military in jobs such as sewing and woodwork and performing various maintenance and laundry chores.|$|E
50|$|This is <b>a</b> partial <b>{{privilege}}.</b> <b>A</b> {{party who}} has this privilege is still liable for damage caused. This defense is therefore more important {{when there is}} a concomitant issue of whether the opposing party has <b>a</b> valid <b>privilege</b> of defense of property.|$|R

5|$|Along {{with his}} {{political}} career, Dekert's business enterprise was growing. He gathered enough savings {{to become a}} cofounder of the Company of Woolen Manufacture in 1766 (Kompania Manufaktur Wełnianych). In 1775 the Sejm granted him a request to buy landed estates (<b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> usually restricted only to the nobility). In 1776 he leased the Tobacco Monopoly (or Company; Kompania Tabaczna) from the Polish Treasury; ten years later, in 1786, he leased a theatre in Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|Due to his wartime experiences, Frederick William was {{convinced}} that Brandenburg-Prussia would only prevail with a standing army. Traditionally, raising and financing army reserves was <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> of the estates, yet Frederick William envisioned a standing army financed independently of the estates. He succeeded in getting the consent and necessary financial contributions of the estates in a landtag decree of 26 July 1653. In turn, he confirmed several privileges of the knights, including tax exemption, assertion of jurisdiction and police powers on their estates (Patrimonialgerichtsbarkeit) and the upholding of serfdom (Leibeigenschaft, Bauernlegen).|$|E

5|$|In their heraldic achievements, {{members of}} the Order of the Garter may {{encircle}} their escutcheon with the Garter. Knights and Ladies Companion are also entitled to receive heraldic supporters, <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> granted to few other private individuals. While some families claim supporters by ancient use, {{and others have been}} granted them as a special reward, only {{members of the}} Royal Family, peers, Knights and Ladies Companion of the Garter, Knights and Ladies of the Thistle, and Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the junior orders of chivalry are automatically entitled to them.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{regarded}} as the greatest batsman {{in the history of}} cricket, the right-handed Bradman played in all five Tests as captain at No. 3. Bradman was more influential than other Australian captains because he {{was also one of the}} three selectors who had a hand in choosing the squad. He was also a member of the Australian Board of Control while still playing, <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> that no other person has held. At the age of 40, Bradman was by far the oldest player on the team; three-quarters of his team were at least eight years younger, and some viewed him as a father figure. Coupled with his status as a national hero, cricketing ability and influence as an administrator, this associated the team more closely to him than other teams to their respective captains. Bradman's iconic stature as a cricketer also led to record-breaking public interest and attendances at the matches on tour.|$|E
5|$|In Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor (1998), the High Court {{suggested}} on an obiter {{basis that}} voting is <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> {{rather than a}} right. It has been suggested by law academic Thio Li-ann that, if called upon to decide the issue, the court might infer {{the existence of the}} right to vote in the Constitution from its text and structure, and {{from the fact that it}} is an adaptation of the Westminster system of democracy. If the right to vote were to be found to be implicit in the Constitution, the judiciary would be better able to protect the right when issues arise before the courts.|$|E

This feature {{is being used to}} enforce application isolation, where applications in a medium integrity level, such as all applications running in the standard user context can not hook into system level processes which run in high integrity level, such as administrator mode applications but can hook onto lower integrity processes like Windows Internet Explorer 7 or 8. <b>A</b> lower <b>privilege</b> process cannot perform a window handle validation of higher process privilege, cannot SendMessage or PostMessage to higher privilege application windows, cannot use thread hooks to attach to <b>a</b> higher <b>privilege</b> process, cannot use Journal hooks to monitor <b>a</b> higher <b>privilege</b> process and cannot perform DLL-injection to <b>a</b> higher <b>privilege</b> process.|$|R

5|$|Oral {{tradition}} {{holds that}} either Hotu Matu‘a or Tu‘u ko Iho, the legendary founder(s) of Rapa Nui, brought 67tablets from their homeland. The same founder is also credited with bringing indigenous {{plants such as}} the toromiro. However, there is no homeland likely {{to have had a}} tradition of writing in Polynesia or even in South America. Thus rongorongo appears to have been an internal development. Given that few if any of the Rapanui people remaining on the island in the 1870s could read the glyphs, it is likely that only a small minority were ever literate. Indeed, early visitors were told that literacy was <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> of the ruling families and priests who were all kidnapped in the Peruvian slaving raids or died soon afterwards in the resulting epidemics.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Jagiello's {{accession}} to the Polish throne, Jagiello granted Vilnius a city charter {{like that of}} Kraków, modeled on the Magdeburg Law; and Vytautas issued <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> to a Jewish commune of Trakai on almost the same terms as privileges issued to the Jews of Poland in the reigns of Boleslaus the Pious and Casimir the Great. Władysław's policy of unifying the two legal systems was partial and uneven at first but achieved a lasting influence. By {{the time of the}} Union of Lublin in 1569, there was not much difference between the administrative and judicial systems in force in Lithuania and Poland.|$|E
5|$|The {{honor of}} {{becoming}} an altar server, was, in the past, <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> only available to boys but has since become coed. Altar servers wear long, white, plain robes and assist the priest in his duties during the Mass. At Mt. St. Peter Church, there are four altar servers at every Mass. One is the book bearer and {{is in charge of}} bringing the Bible to the priest at the times during which the priest reads from the Bible during the Mass. The cross bearer holds a large, wooded crucifix and commences the procession in which the priest enters the church. Also present in the procession are the acolytes, and the book bearer. He or she also leads the procession out of the church {{at the end of the}} Mass. The last two altar servers are acolytes and are in charge of lighting the candles in the church prior to the beginning of the Mass and extinguishing them after Mass.|$|E

Facing Bjelke-Petersen's opposition to such a system, he was successful in seeing established a Subordinate Legislation Committee and <b>a</b> <b>Privileges</b> Committee, the latter of which he became chair.|$|R

40|$|To avoid {{reaching}} incorrect verdicts as {{a result}} of insufficient evidence, courts generally require witnesses to testify to all relevant facts within their knowledge. Two important exceptions to this general rule, incompetency and privilege, rest on very different rationales. Developed at common law to exclude unreliable evidence, rules of competency disqualify certain untrustworthy witnesses from testifying. To promote extrinsic public policies, however, privileges excuse competent witnesses from providing what may be highly probative and reliable evidence. In the past decade there have been calls for legislative or judicial recognition of <b>a</b> parent-child <b>privilege,</b> similar to the marital privilege, that would excuse parents from testifying against their offspring. In contrast to the virtually universal recognition of the marital privilege, however, among common law jurisdictions only Idaho recognized <b>a</b> parent–child <b>privilege</b> until <b>a</b> New York appellate court did so on federal constitutional grounds. This comment, in three parts, evaluates the propriety of recognizing <b>a</b> parent–child <b>privilege.</b> First, scrutiny of the general policy arguments advanced in support of the privilege and ananalysis of the privilege in light of Wigmore 2 ̆ 7 s conditions precedent to establishing any interpersonal privilege illustrate that sound public policy does not support recognition of <b>a</b> parent–child <b>privilege.</b> Second, despite the reasoning of the New York appellate court, the constitutional right of privacy does not encompass <b>a</b> parent–child <b>privilege.</b> Finally, the impossibility of fashioning an acceptable form of the privilege further demonstrates that <b>a</b> parent–child <b>privilege</b> should not be recognized...|$|R
5|$|The {{population}} was governed under these leaders by a customary law that remained {{distinct from the}} common law of Scotland {{for the remainder of}} the Middle Ages. One documented aspect of Carrick and Galloway law was the power of sergeants (an original Gaelic word Latinised as Kethres), officials of the earl or of other captains, to claim one night of free hospitality (<b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> called sorryn et frithalos), and to accuse and arrest with little restriction. The personal demesne, or lands, of the earl was probably extensive in Donnchadh's time; in 1260, during the minority of Donnchadh's descendant Countess Marjory of Carrick, an assessment made by the Scottish king showed that the earls had estates throughout the province, in upland locations like Straiton, Glengennet and Bennan, as well as in the east in locations such as Turnberry and Dalquharran.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditions of}} a sejmik {{can be traced}} to the {{institution}} of the wiec that actually predates the Polish state. They originated from gatherings of nobility, formed for military and consultative purposes. Historians disagree about the specific date of origin of the sejmiks, with some proposed dates being 1374 (the Privilege of Koszyce) and 1454 (the Nieszawa Statutes). Geographically, sejmiks first arose in central Poland (Greater Poland province). Over the next century or so, they spread to other provinces of Poland, and finally, by the 16th century, to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Sejmiks were legally recognized by the 1454 Nieszawa Statutes, in <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> granted to the szlachta (Polish nobility) by King Casimir IV Jagiellon, when the king agreed to consult with the nobility concerning certain decisions. Casimir's recognition of the sejmik stemmed from an attempt to limit the growing power of the magnates, and counteract it with the middle nobility.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> {{escalation}} exploit {{was discovered}} in the Windows kernel that can allow unsigned code to run under Windows RT; the exploit involved {{the use of a}} remote debugging tool (provided by Microsoft to debug WinRT apps on Windows RT devices) to execute code which changes the signing level stored in RAM to allow unsigned code to execute (by default, it is set to a level that only allows code signed by Microsoft to execute). Alongside his explanation of the exploit, the developer also included a personal appeal to Microsoft urging them to remove the restrictions on Windows RT devices, contending that their decision was not for technical reasons, and that the devices would be more valuable if this functionality were available. In a statement, a Microsoft spokesperson applauded the effort, indicating that the exploit does not pose a security threat because it requires administrative access to the device, advanced techniques, and would still require programs to be re-compiled for ARM. However, Microsoft has still indicated that the exploit would be patched in a future update.|$|E
50|$|In pre-revolutionary France all books {{needed to}} be {{approved}} by official censors and authors and publishers had to obtain <b>a</b> royal <b>privilege</b> before <b>a</b> book could be published. Royal privileges were exclusive and usually granted for six years, with the possibility of renewal. Over time it was established that the owner of <b>a</b> royal <b>privilege</b> has the sole right to obtain a renewal indefinitely. In 1761 the Royal Council awarded <b>a</b> royal <b>privilege</b> to the heirs of an author rather than the author's publisher, sparking a national debate on the nature of literary property similar to that taking place in Britain during the battle of the booksellers.|$|R

5|$|Privy Counsellors {{have the}} right to sit {{on the steps of the}} Sovereign's Throne in the Chamber of the House of Lords during debates, <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> which was shared with heirs {{apparent}} of those hereditary peers who were to become members of the House of Lords before Labour's partial Reform of the Lords in 1999, diocesan bishops of the Church of England yet to be Lords Spiritual, retired bishops who formerly sat in the House of Lords, the Dean of Westminster, Peers of Ireland, the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery and the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod. While Privy Counsellors {{have the right}} to sit on the steps of the Sovereign's Throne they do so only as observers and are not allowed to participate in any of the workings of the House of Lords. Nowadays this privilege is rarely exercised. A notable recent instance of the exercising of this privilege was used by the Prime Minister, Theresa May, who watched the opening of the debate of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill 2017 in the House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|The Theses {{are written}} as propositions to be argued {{in a formal}} {{academic}} disputation, {{though there is no}} evidence that such an event ever took place. In the heading of the Theses, Luther invited interested scholars from other cities to participate. Holding such a debate was <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> Luther held as a doctor, and it was not an unusual form of academic inquiry. Luther prepared twenty sets of theses for disputation at Wittenberg between 1516 and 1521. Andreas Karlstadt had written a set of such theses in April 1517, and these were more radical in theological terms than Luther's. He posted them on the door of All Saints' Church, as Luther was alleged to have done with the Ninety-five Theses. Karlstadt posted his theses at a time when the relics of the church were placed on display, and this may have been considered a provocative gesture. Similarly, Luther posted the Ninety-five Theses on the eve of All Saints' Day, the most important day of the year for the display of relics at All Saints' Church.|$|E
5|$|The {{right to}} vote in Singapore is not {{explicitly}} stated in Singapore's Constitution, but the Government has expressed the view {{that it may be}} inferred from the fact that Singapore is a representative democracy and from specific constitutional provisions, including Articles 65 and 66 which set out requirements for the prorogation and dissolution of Parliament and the holding of general elections. Speaking on the matter in Parliament in 2009, the Minister for Law, K. Shanmugam, said that the {{right to vote}} could not be a mere privilege as this would imply the existence of an institution superior to the body of citizens that is empowered to grant such <b>a</b> <b>privilege,</b> but that no such institution exists in a free country. In 1966 a Constitutional Commission chaired by Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin advocated entrenching the right to vote within the Constitution, but this was not taken up by the Parliament of the day. When this proposal was repeated during the 2009 parliamentary debate, the Government took the view that such entrenchment was unnecessary.|$|E
