5|$|With the {{progress}} of European colonization in the territories of the contemporary United States, the Native Americans were often conquered and displaced. The native population of America declined after Europeans arrived, and for various reasons, primarily diseases such as smallpox and measles. Violence was not <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the overall decline among Native Americans, though conflict among themselves and with Europeans affected specific tribes and various colonial settlements.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, San Francisco {{became a}} major debarkation point for {{servicemen}} stationed in the Pacific Theater. The U.S. military, which was concerned about male homosexuality, had a policy of dismissing servicemen caught in known gay establishments with blue discharges. As many of these men faced ostracism from their communities and families, they chose {{to remain in the}} city. The number of men that remained was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the creation of a homosexual community in San Francisco.|$|E

Some years earlier, Harding had had his front porch remodeled to {{resemble}} McKinley's, which his neighbors felt signified presidential ambitions. The candidate remained at home in Marion and gave addresses to visiting delegations. In the meantime, Cox and Roosevelt stumped the nation, giving hundreds of speeches.

5|$|The {{effect on}} Burgoyne's {{campaign}} was significant. Not only had he lost nearly 1,000 men, of which half were regulars, {{but he also}} lost the crucial Indian support. In a council following the battle, many of the Indians (who had traveled with him from Quebec) decided to go home. This loss severely hampered Burgoyne's reconnaissance efforts {{in the days to}} come. The failure to bring in nearby supplies meant that he had to rely on supply lines that were already dangerously long, and that he eventually broke in September. The shortage of supplies was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> his decision to surrender at Saratoga, following which France entered the war.|$|E
5|$|Tourism {{organizations}} elsewhere reported {{increases in}} bookings after their locations appeared in Game of Thrones. In 2012, bookings through LateRooms.com increased by 28 percent in Dubrovnik and 13 percent in Iceland. The following year, bookings doubled in Ouarzazate, Morocco (the location of Daenerys' season-three scenes). Game of Thrones has been attributed as <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the boom of tourism in Iceland {{that had a}} strong impact on its economy. Tourist numbers increased by 30% in 2015, followed by another 40% in 2016, with a final figure of 2.4 million visitors expected for 2016, which is around seven times {{the population of the}} country.|$|E

5|$|After {{his single}} season at Reedley, McCarty {{transferred}} to Western Washington University and played football for the Vikings. McCarty was immediately <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the Vikings' gameplan. In the season opener, he rushed for 139 {{yards and three}} touchdowns on 30 carries against the Humboldt State Lumberjacks. He also played a large role in the passing game early in the season, making eight receptions for 126 yards through the first two games. After starting the first seven games for the Vikings, McCarty broke his foot in a game against the South Dakota Hardrockers. At the time of his injury, he led the Vikings in rushing and receiving yards. He finished the season with 492 rushing yards and five touchdowns on 130 carries, as well as 30 receptions for 278 yards. McCarty was also named a second-team all-star of the North Central Conference.|$|E
5|$|Benaud {{returned}} for the Third Test, when England levelled the series despite twin half-centuries of 73 and 53 from Harvey, who top-scored in both innings on a dustbowl in a match that lasted only three days. Harvey {{failed to pass}} 35 {{in the last two}} Tests, and ended with 338 runs at 42.25, and was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> Australia's eventual 2–1 victory. In {{the second half of the}} tour, Harvey added centuries against Nottinghamshire and Warwickshire and took his career best bowling fugres of 4/8 against Middlesex to help set up a ten-wicket win. He ended his final tour for Australia with 1452 runs at 44.00 with five centuries. During the season, Harvey and Benaud led aggressively to force a result through attacking strategy and a determination to avoid time-wasting.|$|E
5|$|In Stage four (authority {{and social}} order {{obedience}} driven), {{it is important}} to obey laws, dictums, and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three. A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong. If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. When someone does violate a law, it is morally wrong; culpability is thus <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones. Most active members of society remain at stage four, where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force.|$|E

50|$|The Stalingrad victory, certain curbing of {{the terror}} {{campaign}} (actually since December 1942, formally in February 1943) and amnesty promised to repenting collaborants were <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>factors</b> <b>in</b> the 1943 growth of the Soviet partisan forces. Desertions {{from the ranks of}} the German-controlled Hilfspolizei and military formations strengthened, with sometimes whole units coming over to Soviet partisan side — Volga Tartars battalion (900 personnel, February 1943), Gil-Rodionov 1st Russian People's brigade of the SS (2500 personnel, August 1943). Summarily, about 7 thousand people of miscellaneous anti-Soviet formations joined the Soviet partisan force. About 1,9 thousand specialists and commanders were inserted in the Belarusian lands in 1943. However, the local people comprised the core of the personnel influx in the Soviet partisan force.|$|R

5|$|Industry {{appeared}} {{very early}} in Sélestat. The town had already several factories {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century: a tilery, a sawmill, 12 tanneries and 11 mills. Sélestat quickly became specialised in wire gauze making but it never became a large industrial centre, remaining a small town with limited influence. The completion of the Strasbourg-Basel railway (1840), one of the first to be built in France, did not lead to significant urban development. The town walls that still encircled the town were <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> its economic and demographic stagnation. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Alsace and a part of Lorraine were annexed by the new German Empire. The German authorities demolished the city walls in 1874 and built new spacious neighbourhoods around the old town, as they did in Strasbourg and Metz.|$|E
5|$|Macedonia's {{parliament}} {{adopted a}} declaration of independence from Yugoslavia in January 1991, {{but it did not}} take effect until a referendum in September 1991 confirmed it. A group of Macedonian JNA officers secretly sought to prevent soldiers from Macedonia being sent to Croatia, and busloads of soldiers' parents, funded by the Macedonian government, travelled to Montenegro to find their sons and bring them home. Meanwhile, Macedonians continued to be conscripted into the JNA and serve in the war in Croatia. The commander of JNA forces in {{the first phase of the}} battle, Gen. Aleksandar Spirkovski, was a Macedonian. His ethnicity was probably <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the decision to replace him with Života Panić, a Serb. In 2005, the Macedonian Army's Chief of Staff, Gen. Miroslav Stojanovski, became the focus of international controversy after it was alleged that he had been involved in possible war crimes following the battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{recognition}} of Buckeyes in the Standard has been <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> its survival. In the past, largely due {{its lack of}} color variations, the Buckeye {{has not been an}} especially popular exhibition breed, but there is growing interest in the exhibition poultry fancy for this dual-purpose variety of bird. Not adopted by commercial operations, the Buckeye has generally been a bird of smaller farm flocks. Today the breed status is listed as threatened by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy, threatened being defined as: Fewer than 1,000 breeding birds in the United States, with seven or fewer primary breeding flocks, and estimated global population less than 5,000. The breed is also included in the Slow Food USA Ark of Taste, a catalog of heritage foods in danger of extinction.|$|E

5|$|In France the {{campaign}} was represented as a victory, as Linois' genuine achievements at Algeciras were followed by exaggerated reports of Troude's defence in Conil Bay in which the second battle was represented as a significant success against a more numerous British force. Troude had shown skill and bravery in the engagement, but his subsequent reputation was largely built {{on the strength of}} a report sent to Paris by Dumanoir le Pelley which was based on a letter written by Captain Troude. In the letter, he claimed that he had fought not only Venerable and Thames, but also Caesar and Spencer (misidentified in the report as Superb). Troude stated that he had not only driven all of these ships off, but that he had also completely destroyed Venerable by driving the ship ashore. Troude was subsequently promoted and highly praised, holding a number of important active commands in the French Navy. In Spain, the outcome of {{the campaign}} infuriated the Spanish government and contributed to the souring of the Franco-Spanish alliance. The Spanish demanded that the Spanish forces then stationed at Brest on the French Atlantic coast return to Spanish waters, and Spanish pressure on Portugal was relaxed. This weakening of the Franco-Spanish axis was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the Treaty of Amiens in early 1802 that brought the French Revolutionary Wars to a close.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after taking}} charge, Manekshaw reached the {{conclusion}} that poor leadership had been <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> IV Corps' failure in the war with China. He felt that his foremost responsibility was to improve the morale of his demoralized soldiers, and issued orders {{to advance to the}} positions lost in the war, which kept morale up. Just five days into his command, Nehru visited the headquarters with his daughter Indira Gandhi and the COAS, and found the troops advancing. Nehru stated {{that he did not want}} any more men to die. The COAS assured him that he would get the orders rescinded. Manekshaw retorted that the COAS should allow him to command his troops the way he wished or send him to a staff appointment. Gandhi intervened and told Manekshaw to go ahead. Though Gandhi had no official position, she had great influence in the government. The next task Manekshaw took-up was to reorganize the troops in North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA). He took measures to overcome the shortages of equipment, accommodation, and clothing.|$|E
