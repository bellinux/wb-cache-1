5|$|Haywood {{observed}} {{how the government}} frequently took the side of business to defeat the tactics and the aspirations of the miners. During an 1899 organizing drive in Coeur d'Alene, with pay cuts as a motivating issue, the company hired spies and then fired organizers and pro-union miners. Some frustrated miners responded with violence and when two men were killed, martial law was declared. As they had done in a strike in Coeur d'Alene seven years earlier, soldiers acted as strike breakers. They rounded up hundreds of union members without formal charges {{and put them in}} <b>a</b> <b>filthy,</b> vermin-infested warehouse without sanitation services for a year. They were so crowded that the soldiers locked the overflow of prisoners in boxcars. One local union leader was imprisoned for 17 years.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{had been}} uninvolved in the {{upbringing}} {{of all his}} children. This provided producers with scope to introduce estranged family members. In 2006, writers devised a long-running storyline in-which Paul's son Robert (Adam Hunter) plans a revenge campaign against his father. Robert's motives for his vendetta stem from Paul not being around while he grew up. Paul was happy that he had triplet children Elle, Robert and Cameron Robinson (also played by Hunter) back in his life. He tries to make amends with Robert and attempts to bond with him unaware that he is being plotted against. Writers decided to mark the show's 5000th episode with the story and Robert takes Paul hostage down a mineshaft. Dennis filmed the scenes in <b>a</b> <b>filthy</b> studio set surrounded by cameras, lighting and crew. He told Herbison (Inside Soap) that he {{found it difficult to}} pretend he was trapped underground.|$|E

25|$|Dryad was {{employed}} on less glamorous tasks as well - during August 1812 she conveyed bullocks to the Channel Fleet, <b>a</b> <b>filthy</b> and unpleasant mission. On 23 December 1812 Captain Galway drove a French brig of 22 guns ashore on the Île d'Yeu, which wrecked her. Dryad took several hits in her hull and foremast from shots fired by shore batteries but suffered no casualties.|$|E
500|$|According to McGee, Corbucci was [...] "the nicest man" [...] during production, and [...] "never {{tried to}} put the make on" [...] her. The actress {{attributed}} this to the frequent presence of his wife Nori on the set, noting that [...] "they were such a happy couple. They made it a great environment to work in." [...] However, at one point while filming, Wolff had to be restrained from strangling Kinski when the latter insulted his Jewish heritage by telling him [...] "I don't want to work with <b>a</b> <b>filthy</b> Jew like you; I'm German and hate Jews." [...] Following the incident, Wolff refused to speak to Kinski unless required to by the script. Kinski later declared that he insulted Wolff because he wanted to stimulate and help him get into character.|$|E
500|$|The {{band played}} their first {{headline}} gig at the 350-capacity ABC2, a small venue in Glasgow in late 2005. The gig was a sell-out show. In November 2005, they were named as the inaugural [...] "Artist of the Month" [...] in the Your Sound competition; a scheme run by Glasgow music venue King Tut's Wah Wah Hut along with DF Concerts to project local unsigned talent. They {{would go on}} to play a sold-out show at King Tut's, despite only ever having appeared at the venue once before. As well as this, a demo version of the song [...] "New Ideas" [...] was included in Have Yourself <b>a</b> <b>Filthy</b> Little Christmas, a compilation album released as a free download by independent record label Filthy Little Angels on 12 December 2005.|$|E

500|$|About [...] {{of night}} soil were {{collected}} in Rochdale each year, from a population of about64,000—roughly [...] per person. [...] At the depot, the night soil was emptied into a storage tank. [...] The pails were washed in a large trough using a mixture of chloride of lime and water. [...] The night soil was then dried in revolving cylinders, using furnace heat from other borough refuse, before being transferred to so-called drying plates. [...] Gases were burnt in a furnace, the fumes escaping up a [...] chimney. [...] Clinker from the remains of burnt refuse was used to make mortar. [...] The manure works was <b>a</b> <b>filthy</b> environment, filled with dust. [...] Enginemen were paid 7¼d, firemen 6½d, and general labourers 4½d. [...] The fertiliser was transported from the works via railway to local filtration plots for disposal.|$|E
500|$|Bannings of Candide lasted {{into the}} twentieth century in the United States, where it has long been {{considered}} a seminal work of Western literature. At least once, Candide was temporarily barred from entering America: in February 1929, a US customs official in Boston prevented a number of copies of the book, deemed [...] "obscene", from reaching a Harvard University French class. Candide was admitted in August of the same year; however by that time the class was over. In an interview soon after Candides detention, the official who confiscated the book explained the office's decision to ban it, [...] "But about 'Candide,' I'll tell you. For years we've been letting that book get by. There were so many different editions, all sizes and kinds, some illustrated and some plain, that we figured the book must be all right. Then one of us happened to read it. It's <b>a</b> <b>filthy</b> book".|$|E
500|$|Ben H. Grimm's {{review in}} The Moving Picture World was {{completely}} negative and {{described it as}} [...] "one of the most insidious, moral-destroying pictures ever produced. It will lower {{to the level of}} a bawdy house any theater in which it is shown. It reeks of <b>a</b> <b>filthy</b> sex element that struts across the screen in the sheep's clothing of alleged propaganda advocating the segregation of vice." [...] Grimm highlights how the film's prostitute sells herself and finds not ill, but instead gets worldly gains. Grimm also notes that the production is based on the premise that a prostitute is a prostitute by choice, does not want reform and infers that she can not be reformed. Grimm's review stated that the great production was even more detrimental with a metaphor that stated a well-dressed criminal was less likely to be suspected than a poorly dressed criminal.|$|E

500|$|Astonished {{and deeply}} bruised by the discovery, Nan wanders {{the streets of}} London, finally holing herself in <b>a</b> <b>filthy</b> {{boarding}} house for weeks {{in a state of}} madness until her funds run out. After spying the male costumes she took as her only memory of her time with Kitty, Nan begins to walk the streets of London as a man and easily passes. She is solicited by a man for sex and begins renting, but dressed only as a man for male clients, never letting them know she is a woman. She meets a socialist activist named Florence who lives near the boarding house, but before she can get to know her, Nan is hired by a wealthy widow with licentious tastes named Diana. Although realising—and initially enjoying—that she is an object to Diana and her friends, Nan stays with her for over a year as [...] "Neville", dressed in the finest men's clothes Diana can afford. The relationship erodes, however, and Diana throws Nan into the streets.|$|E

He made this gesture of total subservience to politics after years as an anarchist despising and denouncing politics. But he could not transfer his genius from art to politics. The stirring drawings were replaced by boring and banal speeches. He had none of the gifts of the natural politician, his stock in trade was limited to platitudes and slogans. The wild man, tamed, became a political hack. If as an anarchist he had believed that politics was <b>a</b> <b>filthy</b> business, as a Communist he still seemed to believe it was — only now it was his business." ...|$|E

One of the inspectors noted: [...] "These vessels brought in several hundred refugees and are generally rat-infested. They are in <b>a</b> <b>filthy,</b> deplorable condition.

2500|$|To {{help define}} the film's look the crew watched period {{films such as}} Sleepy Hollow, Amadeus, Oliver Twist, Barry Lyndon, From Hell, The Elephant Man, Dracula, Brotherhood of the Wolf, Vidocq, and Les Misérables.

[...] "We needed <b>a</b> <b>filthy</b> city to get the real feel for the smells of it", said Griebe.
