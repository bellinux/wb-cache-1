5|$|A new {{central library}} was {{discussed}} by library administrators {{for several decades}} <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> regional council in 2008. The architects, {{a joint venture between}} local firm Fowler Bauld and Mitchell and Schmidt Hammer Lassen of Denmark, were chosen in 2010 through an international design competition. Construction began later that year on a prominent downtown site that had been a parking lot for half a century.|$|E
5|$|An {{entirely new}} design {{incorporating}} the latest dreadnought technology was {{drawn up by}} J.R. Perrett, the head of Elswick Ordnance Company, <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Brazilian government on 20 February 1907. Argentina and Chile immediately annulled the 1902 treaty that had ended their naval arms race, and both planned to expand their own navies, though Chile was delayed by a financial depression in 1907 and a major earthquake the next year.|$|E
5|$|The two seaports, {{which had}} been rivals {{for most of the}} 20th century but lost ground to nearby ports in British Columbia, {{proposed}} a merger of marine cargo operations in 2014.

5|$|A {{radical change}} of tactics, which {{involved}} {{the introduction of}} a bill to ban British subjects from aiding or participating in the slave trade to the French colonies, was suggested by maritime lawyer James Stephen. It was a shrewd move, since the majority of British ships were now flying American flags and supplying slaves to foreign colonies with whom Britain was at war. A bill was introduced <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cabinet, and Wilberforce and other abolitionists maintained a self-imposed silence, so as not to draw any attention to the effect of the bill. The approach proved successful, and the new Foreign Slave Trade Bill was quickly passed, and received royal assent on 23 May 1806.|$|E
5|$|As a {{condition}} of receiving the grant, the P.R. Department of the Family must submit an annual plan of operation to the FNS, which describes how it will distribute the funds assigned as nutrition assistance to qualifying persons. This includes identifying the island population which is eligible for the NAP benefits (i.e., family income limits, family status limits, etc.), establishing the process in which individual participants are selected, {{and the process of}} determining the benefit amount for each participant. The plan of operation is reviewed <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> FNS before funds are disbursed.|$|E
5|$|Each team {{selected}} {{a squad of}} up to 15players, and any changes to that squad due to illness or injury had to be requested in writing <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ICC's Event Technical Committee. Three such replacements {{were made to the}} squads, with South Africa, Sri Lanka and the West Indies making a change. England entered the tournament with the top-ranked players in both the ICC's batting and bowling rankings, Claire Taylor and Isa Guha respectively, but Australia were commonly lidted in the press as favourites to win the tournament. Taylor finished the tournament as the leading run-scorer, accumulating 324 runs, and her England team-mate Laura Marsh was the most prolific wicket-taker, claiming 16 wickets.|$|E

The voting age {{has been reduced to}} eighteen, voting residency requirements have been removed, and voter registration conforms to the Motor Voter Act. Additionally, the Virginia Constitution now provides for a General Assembly session following a governor’s veto, and {{the right of the people}} to hunt, fish and harvest game is guaranteed. In 2006, Virginians passed an amendment limiting marriage to “unions between one man and one woman”. That has since been overturned by Obergefell v. Hodges (2015).|$|E

Saint Kitts and Nevis' National Olympic Committee (NOC) was first officially recognized in 1993. The NOC and Commonwealth Games Association (CGA) both governed multiple sports prior to 1998. Since they both {{shared the same}} member organizations, the CGA merged with the NOC, making the NOC responsible for both the Olympic Games and the Commonwealth Games. The constitution was revised on June 10, 2004; ratified November 30, 2006; <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> International Olympic Committee (IOC) June 1, 2007.|$|E

As a result, the European Commission launched an infringement procedure against Bulgaria that forced the Ministry to withdraw the positive environmental assessment of the Master Plan in 2010 but the decision was rejected by the Supreme Administrative Court. The Strandzha Nature Park Management Plan drafted in 2003 has not yet meet with approval by the Ministry of Environment and Water.|$|E
5|$|Zirconium binds urea, a {{property}} {{that has been}} utilized extensively {{to the benefit of}} patients with chronic kidney disease. For example, zirconium is a primary component of the sorbent column dependent dialysate regeneration and recirculation system known as the REDY system, which was first introduced in 1973. More than 2,000,000 dialysis treatments have been performed using the sorbent column in the REDY system. Although the REDY system was superseded in the 1990s by less expensive alternatives, new sorbent-based dialysis systems are being evaluated <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Renal Solutions developed the DIALISORB technology, a portable, low water dialysis system. Also, developmental versions of a Wearable Artificial Kidney have incorporated sorbent-based technologies.|$|E
5|$|Blue's Clues {{was set in}} the home—the {{environment}} that was most familiar and secure for preschoolers—and looked like no other children's television show. Each episode was in development, from idea development to final production, for approximately one year. Writers created a goal sheet, which identified their objectives based on the show's curriculum and audience needs. Script drafts, once developed <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> show's creators and research team, were tested at public and private schools, day care centers, preschools, and Head Start programs by three researchers, who would narrate {{the story in the}} form of a storybook and take notes about the children's responses. The writers and creators revised the scripts based on this feedback. A rough video, in which the host performed from the revised script in front of a blue screen with no animation, was filmed and retested. The script was revised based on the audiences' responses, tested a third time with animation and music added, and incorporated into future productions.|$|E

5|$|Formerly an {{administrative}} district {{in its own}} right, even a regional capital, Carabane is now just one of 23villages in the rural community of Diembéring, of which Kabrousse, Cap Skirring, and Boucott-Diembéring are the largest centres. This rural community {{is located in the}} Kabrousse Arrondissement. It is part of Oussouye Department, the smallest and least central of the three departments in Ziguinchor Region. In a country which includes some 13,000 villages, the village is considered, by a 1972 decree, the elementary entity in the administrative body of the nation. Each is administered by a leader, assisted by a council. After consultation, the nomination of a leader is established by the prefect <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Minister of the Interior. Under Senegalese law, the leader of the village has certain prerogatives, including law enforcement, tax collection, and keeping of vital records in the village.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} become {{recognised}} fully by the American Kennel Club, they must first compete in a Miscellaneous Class. The requirements to compete in that class are to demonstrate a following by having a minimum of 100 active members in a national breed club, a population of 300 to 400 dogs, with third generation pedigrees and for all dogs in those pedigrees {{to be of the}} same breed, a distribution across twenty or more states, and the breed standard must be reviewed <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> AKC. Currently there are five dogs in the AKC's Miscellaneous Class which are Dogue de Bordeaux, Redbone Coonhound, Irish Red and White Setter, Norwegian Buhund and Pyrenean Shepherd. Typical stays in that class are between one and three years, and the national club of the breed must have held seminars, shows and judges workshops prior to being fully recognised.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{supported}} {{the pipeline project}} even before the oil crisis. On September 10, 1973, he released a message stating that the pipeline was his priority {{for the remainder of}} the Congressional session that year. On November 8, after the embargo had been in place for three weeks, he reaffirmed that statement. Members of Congress, under pressure from their constituents, created the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, which removed all legal barriers from construction of the pipeline, provided financial incentives, and granted a right-of-way for its construction. The act was drafted, rushed through committee, <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> House on November 12, 1973, by a vote of 361–14–60. The next day, the Senate passed it, 80–5–15. Nixon signed it into law on November 16, and a federal right-of-way for the pipeline and transportation highway was granted on January 3, 1974. The deal was signed by the oil companies on January 23, allowing work to start.|$|E
