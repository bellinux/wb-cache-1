5|$|The two upper {{register}} wings {{on either}} side of Jesus show a pair of angels holding the instruments of the Passion. These include a lance, crown of thorns and a stick with <b>a</b> <b>sponge</b> soaked in vinegar. The angels are dressed in white liturgical vestments.|$|E
5|$|Also {{introduced}} {{in this volume}} were Cutts the butcher (originally Sanzot from the French sans os ("without bones")) and the Bordurian chief of secret police Colonel Sponsz, whose name {{is derived from the}} Brussels dialect term for <b>a</b> <b>sponge</b> (éponge in French). Hergé used his brother, Paul Remi, as the model for Sponsz, although he was also influenced by the image of the Austrian American filmmaker Erich von Stroheim.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> treacle <b>sponge</b> pudding is <b>a</b> {{traditional}} British dessert dish {{consisting of}} <b>a</b> steamed <b>sponge</b> cake with treacle cooked {{on top of}} it, sometimes also poured over it and often served with hot custard.|$|R
5|$|For ships, unlike aircraft, one {{deals with}} {{incompressible}} flows, where change in water density is negligible (a pressure rise close to 1000kPa {{leads to a}} change of only 2–3 kg/m3). This field of fluid dynamics is called hydrodynamics. A ship engineer designs for hydrodynamics first, and for strength only later. The boundary layer development, breakdown, and separation become critical because the high viscosity of water produces high shear stresses. Another consequence of high viscosity is the slip stream effect, in which the ship moves like a spear tearing through <b>a</b> <b>sponge</b> at high velocity.|$|E
5|$|The gun was a {{traditional}} muzzleloader; {{it needed to}} be loaded {{from the end of the}} barrel. Before it could be loaded the bore of the barrel was cleaned with <b>a</b> <b>sponge,</b> after which a propellant charge (gunpowder in a cloth bag) was rammed down into the breech. This was followed by a projectile, often encased in wadding. The gun was primed (using a metal spike inserted through the vent that pierced the charge), and fired using a percussion cap (which ignited the charge and forced the projectile out of the barrel).|$|E
5|$|Headed by Saint Peter, the Apostles {{are dressed}} in white robes and sit on two facing benches set below Christ {{and to the right}} and left of the choir of virgins. Two angels attend to the groups {{gathered}} at each side of the benches. A further two angels are positioned immediately above Christ. They hold his cross and {{are dressed in}} white amice and albs, with the right hand angel wearing an outer blue dalmatic vestment. They are flanked on either side by angels playing long wind instruments, probably trumpets. The two angels on either side of Christ bear the symbols of the crucifixion already represented on the left hand panel. The angel on the left holds a lance and crown of thorns, the angel on the right <b>a</b> <b>sponge</b> and nails.|$|E

25|$|Sponge {{aquaculture}} for spongin or metabolite production capitalises on {{the high}} regenerative abilities of the totipotent sponge cells by using explants (cut pieces of <b>a</b> parent <b>sponge,</b> which will then regrow into <b>a</b> full <b>sponge)</b> as <b>a</b> means of culturing sponges. Sponges have indeterminate growth, with maximum growth determined through environmental constraints rather than genetics. During the initial establishment of <b>a</b> farm, <b>sponge</b> explants will be chosen by their phenotypic characteristics of fast growth and high quality spongin or metabolites.|$|R
50|$|To assure proper {{contact between}} the inmate's head and the electrode, <b>a</b> saline-soaked <b>sponge</b> stuffed between the two was necessary. In the Tafero incident, <b>a</b> natural <b>sponge</b> was {{replaced}} with <b>a</b> synthetic <b>sponge</b> that caught fire during the execution. In the Medina incident, prison officials apparently did not properly soak the sponge in saline and it caught fire as well. Photographs that surfaced after Davis's execution clearly showed that his nose had been severely compressed by a misfitted head strap.|$|R
5|$|Sponges {{have three}} asexual methods of reproduction: after fragmentation; by budding; and by {{producing}} gemmules. Fragments of sponges may be detached by currents or waves. They use {{the mobility of}} their pinacocytes and choanocytes and reshaping of the mesohyl to re-attach themselves to a suitable surface and then rebuild themselves as small but functional sponges {{over the course of}} several days. The same capabilities enable sponges that have been squeezed through a fine cloth to regenerate. <b>A</b> <b>sponge</b> fragment can only regenerate if it contains both collencytes to produce mesohyl and archeocytes to produce all the other cell types. A very few species reproduce by budding.|$|E
5|$|The frog cake {{is a small}} dessert {{shaped to}} {{resemble}} a frog with its mouth open, consisting of <b>a</b> <b>sponge</b> base with a jam centre, topped in artificial cream {{and covered with a}} thick layer of fondant icing. The recipe today remains identical to the one employed when the cake was first produced in the 1920s. When manufactured, large layers of sponge cake are combined and cut mechanically into shape, covered in the fondant, and the mouth is then formed with a hot knife. Fondant eyes of a contrasting colour are manually added to the head, and the completed dessert is presented in a paper patty-pan. The fondant is normally brown, green or pink, but for special occasions colours can include variations such as red and yellow.|$|E
5|$|Hyperion is Titan's nearest {{neighbor}} in the Saturn system. The two moons {{are locked in}} a 4:3 mean-motion resonance with each other, meaning that while Titan makes four revolutions around Saturn, Hyperion makes exactly three. With an average diameter of about 270km, Hyperion is smaller and lighter than Mimas. It has an extremely irregular shape, and a very odd, tan-colored icy surface resembling <b>a</b> <b>sponge,</b> though its interior may be partially porous as well. The average density of about 0.55g/cm3 indicates that the porosity exceeds 40% even assuming it has a purely icy composition. The surface of Hyperion is covered with numerous impact craters—those with diameters 2–10km are especially abundant. It is the only moon besides the small moons of Pluto known to have a chaotic rotation, which means Hyperion has no well-defined poles or equator. While on short timescales the satellite approximately rotates around its long axis {{at a rate of}} 72–75° per day, on longer timescales its axis of rotation (spin vector) wanders chaotically across the sky. This makes the rotational behavior of Hyperion essentially unpredictable.|$|E

5|$|The panel {{captures the}} instant of Christ's death, {{traditionally}} the moment after {{the breaking of}} the thieves' legs (although this is not depicted). Christ is naked except for a transparent veil, with some of his pubic hair visible. His hands and feet are nailed to the timber; the blood from the nail holding his feet to the cross stains its wooden base. His arms strain under the weight of his upper body, and in his final agony, his jaw has fallen slack; his mouth is open with his teeth exposed in the grimace of death. In the mid-ground, {{at the base of the}} cross, Longinus, on horseback, wearing a fur-trimmed hat and green tunic, guided by an assistant, stretches to pierce Jesus' side with a lance, as deep-red blood pours from the wound. To the right of Longinus, a mostly obscured Stephaton holds high <b>a</b> <b>sponge</b> soaked with vinegar on the tip of a reed.|$|E

25|$|On {{the lower}} {{crosspiece}} {{of the central}} cross are back to back statues (géminée) depicting Mary Cléophas, a piéta and Mary Magdalene on one side with Saint John, a statue of the risen Christ and Saint Peter on the other. On the upper crosspiece are two men on horseback, Saint Longinus and Stephaton, the two soldiers {{who were at the}} crucifixion. It was Longinus who pierced Jesus' side so he carries a lance whilst Stephaton carries <b>a</b> <b>sponge</b> as he was the soldier who gave Jesus <b>a</b> <b>sponge</b> soaked in vinegar. On the reverse side of the two horsemen is a depiction of Jesus tied with ropes ("Christ lié"). Jesus hangs from the central cross and is sculpted back to back with an Ecce Homo. The crucified Jesus is surrounded by four small angels who are collecting the blood running from his wounds. Note that Jesus was nailed to the cross but the two thieves were tied to their crosses with rope.|$|E
25|$|Sea sponges {{should be}} cultured at a {{salinity}} of 35ppt (salinity of seawater). Hypersalinity (high salt concentrations) {{in the immediate}} environment surrounding <b>a</b> <b>sponge</b> will dehydrate sponge cells, whereas a hyposaline (low salt concentration) environment dilutes the intracellular environment of the sponge. The pH of water must match that of seawater (pH 7.8–8.4) in order for sponge production to be maximized.|$|E
