5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times was mildly {{positive}} in his review, giving the film two-and-a-half stars {{out of four}} and writing [...] "Soul Surfer is a wholesome movie, intended as inspirational. Whether it will cheer viewers who are not as capable as Bethany is <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>question.</b> AnnaSophia Robb is a convincing, cheerful heroine. Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt, as Bethany's parents, are stalwart and supportive, although the script indeed leaves them with no other choice." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B grade, writing [...] "the more cynical viewers out there may say, 'Not for me.' But Soul Surfer, while formulaic in design, is an authentic and heartfelt movie." [...] S. Jhoanna Robledo of Common Sense Media gave the film three stars out of five, writing [...] "Yes, it's a message movie, but the message burrows deep enough under your skin to make the movie, given its utter conventionality, unexpectedly stirring." ...|$|E

40|$|Why {{do we need}} {{yet another}} cancer journal? <b>An</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>question,</b> of course, {{in light of the}} profusion of general as well as {{specialized}} cancer journals in recent times. An easy answer would simply be to say that this journal will be better than the rest; however a less glib (and probably more accurate) response is simply that there is currently an explosion of new techniques and approaches in the field of cancer biology, and that the new, and sometimes unusual and unorthodox, data so generated demands an open-access and unrestricted forum for its dissemination. This was the impetus for starting the journal which you are now reading. [ [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|My {{contribution}} was well received. Some <b>excellent</b> <b>questions</b> were raised. For example there were nurses attending {{who had been}} experiencing compassion fatigue (CF). They asked if {{the fact that they}} had experienced CF meant that they were not exemplary nurses. This <b>excellent</b> <b>question</b> caused me to re think aspects of the upcoming research project on this same topic. The critique by my colleagues was helpful in clarifying aspects of subsequent investigations. Many people commented that they found the presentation materials reawakened in them their own lived experience which is the test of phenomenology. I judge the experience as positive in many ways. The goal of this phenomenological study was to determine what within the lived experiences of exemplary oncology nurses facilitates the avoidance of compassion fatigue. A purposive sample of 7 oncology nurses (RNs) who were identified by their colleagues as exemplary caregivers was recruited. Data were collected through semi-structured conversations which were subsequently transcribed. Transcripts were analyzed for reoccurring themes using three points of reference; recurrence of ideas, repetition of ideas, and forcefulness with which ideas were expressed (Owen, 1984). Findings focus on three themes; moments of connection, making moments matters, and energizing moments. Discussion highlights practical implications for clinical nurses, nurse educators and health care administrators. Academic & Professional Development Fund (A&PDF...|$|R
