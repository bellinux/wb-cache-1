40|$|Coaxial valves usually contain {{only one}} moving part. It {{has not been}} easy, then, to provide for {{electric}} motor actuation. Many actuators being proposed involve designs which lead to bulky packages. The key facing those improving coaxial valves is the provision of suitable linear actuation. The valve herein indudes a valve housing with a flow channel there-through. Arranged in the flow channel is a closing body. In alignment with the closing body is a ball screw actuator which includes a ball nut and a cylindrical screw. The ball nut sounds a threaded portion of the cylindrical screw.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a new concept}} of a {{technical}} muscle is presented. The proposed muscle is based on standard components and is scalable in many respects: size, weight, power, speed, price, and quality. It is composed of a turning shaft with small diameter and a high-strength and highly flexible plaited cord. The shaft may be driven by a small DC-motor, possibly in combination with a gearbox. This makes design, power supply, and control quite easy compared to other types of artificial muscles such as pneumatic, hydraulic, shape memory alloy, and electro-active polymer muscles. With appropriate measures in design {{it will be able}} to meet various application requirements such as wide temperature range and high IP rating. Moreover, with careful selection and dimensioning of components a very high degree of efficiency, a very high power to weight ratio, and high dependability may be achieved.

40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed that integrates the preliminary wing design with trailing edge high-lift systems and accounts for three-dimensional flap kinematics. The high-lift system in the developed application includes the kinematic synthesis of four common mechanisms (dropped-hinge, four-bar, link-track and hooked-track) and a preliminary actuation architecture. The paper details how each of these mechanisms is synthesized based {{on a set of}} intuitive input requirements such as gap and overlap dimensions in landing and take-off configuration. A SimMechanics multi-body mechanism model is generated to obtain the internal loads of the mechanism and actuation torque. The mechanisms and <b>actuating</b> <b>drive</b> train are structurally sized, leading to a determination of system weight and power consumption. A weight measurement of the outboard hooked-track mechanism of a VFW- 614 flap has been compared to a modeled hooked-track mechanism by using the proposed method. This resulted in a 13 % underestimation of the mechanism weight, which was attributed to modeling simplifications, sizing assumptions and a crude aerodynamic load estimation. A comparison study between the four different mechanism types to be applied on a Boeing 777 wing, shows that the method can give the designer valuable insight in the gap/overlap behavior of the flap during deployment as well as an initial estimation of the difference in required fairing size, mechanism weight, and actuation power between the four mechanisms.

40|$|In today’s highly {{competitive}} aviation industry, continuous efforts are being directed towards reducing design time and simplifying systems. One {{of the prime}} aspects of aircraft design {{is the development of}} high-lift systems, which are used to obtain satisfactory performance in low-speed flight. The associated design and integration of high-lift systems is highly multi-disciplinary and iterative in nature, due to tight dependencies between aerodynamics, mechanism kinematics and structures. Therefore, these systems should be considered early in the design process. Current methods for weight and power estimation of high-lift systems rely on empirical methods which are not sensitive to design variables and load cases. To improve the current design process, a new methodology has been developed, employing a Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) application (inGDL) that integrates the preliminary wing designwith trailing edge high-lift systems and accounts for three-dimensional flap kinematics. The high-lift system in the developed application includes the kinematic synthesis of four commonmechanisms, an initial actuation architecture, weight and power estimate. The development scope has been limited to single-slotted flaps. The developed application works as follows: a clean wing geometry is first generated, after which the designer can assume an initial trailing edge flap layout. By subsequently specifying the required flap settings, the kinematic mechanisms are synthesized. When a feasible design is obtained, a SimMechanics multi-bodymechanism model is generated and then simulated to obtain the internal loads and actuation torque. An initial aerodynamic load of the flap has been determined using an empirical normal load estimation method by ESDU. Next, the mechanisms and <b>actuating</b> <b>drive</b> train are sized, leading to a determination of system weight and drive motor power. The link between the application and sizing module is completely automatized. After a design cycle has beenmade, an automatically generated report presents the obtained feasible design. In order to get an indication of the applied sizing method accuracy, a measurement of the outboard hooked-track mechanism of a VFW- 614 flap has been carried out. The measured weight is compared to a modeled hookedtrack mechanism, synthesized and sized specifically for the VFW- 614 wing. The results show a 13 % underestimation ofmechanism weight, which is caused by modeling simplifications, assumption during sizing and likely the normal load prediction error. The developed application provides designers with the possibility to combine the aerodynamic, kinematic and mechanical aspects in one design environment. By quickly obtaining geometrical and sizing estimates, in addition to identifying design sensitivities, trade-offs can be made earlier in the design process. The application has been made such, that it can be expanded with higher-fidelity analysismodules and additional functionalities. By improving the current modeling concept and sizing method, more accurate results can be obtained and more load cases accounted for. Flight Performance and PropulsionAerospace Engineerin...|$|E

Prosthetists have also reported moderate success with gel liners fit to individuals with upper limb amputations who use externally powered prostheses.

Initial designs have proven more comfortable and easier to don than traditional suction sockets and have allowed us to eliminate the need for separate connection of pre-amplifiers. We believe this technology will be of benefit to individuals with upper or lower limb amputations and eliminate some of the clinical challenges and reported drawbacks of current myoelectric fittings.

5000|$|The VTM-4 system's {{electronic}} control unit (ECU) determines torque {{which is to be}} distributed to the rear wheels, then electric current is sent to the two electromagnetic coils. The resulting magnetic field moves a rotating steel plate toward each fixed coil. Friction between that steel plate and an adjoining cam plate causes the cam plate to begin turning. As it does, three balls per clutch roll up curved ramps, creating an axial thrust against a clutch-engagement plate. This thrust force compresses the wet clutch plates, thereby engaging drive to the corresponding rear wheel. [...] Unlike mechanically <b>actuated</b> four-wheel <b>drive</b> systems, the VTM-4 system is infinitely variable. The amount of torque provided to the rear wheels is directly proportional to the electric current sent from the ECU and can be adjusted from zero to a preset maximum. This current constantly changes to deliver the optimum rear torque calculated by the ECU. An internal gear pump circulates VTM-4 fluid to cool and lubricate the clutches, bearings, and gears within the rear drive unit. Use of high-strength, low-weight materials such as diecast aluminum for the housing minimizes the bulk and weight of this hardware, helping to keep the weight of the entire all-wheel-drive system to about 212-pounds.|$|R
