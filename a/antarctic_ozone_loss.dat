40|$|The Antarctic {{ozone hole}} of 2011 is {{reviewed}} {{from a variety}} of perspectives, making use of various data and analyses. The ozone hole of 2011 was relatively large in terms of maximum area, minimum ozone level and total ozone deficit, being ranked amongst the top ten in terms of severity of the 32 ozone holes adequately characterised since 1979. In particular, the estimated integrated ozone mass effectively removed within the ozone hole of 2011 was 2119 Mt, which is the 7 th largest deficit on record and 82 per cent of the peak value observed in 2006. The key factors in promoting the extent of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in 2011 were the relatively low temperatures that occurred in the lower stratosphere of the polar cap region over most of the year, {{and the fact that the}} stratospheric vortex was relatively strong and stable, at least up to mid-spring. Dynamical disturbance of the polar vortex from mid-spring increased Antarctic ozone levels in the latter part of the ozone hole’s evolution and helped to limit the overall severity of depletion. Through examination of regression of various ozone metrics against expected levels of equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine, we suggest that recent changes in averaged ozone levels over Antarctica show some evidence of the recovery expected due to international controls on the manufacture of ozone depleting chemicals, albeit at a statistically low level of confidence due to the influence of meteorological factors that largely dictate year-to-year variability of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>loss...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{review the}} 2012 Antarctic ozone hole, {{making use of}} various {{meteorological}} reanalyses, remotely sensed ozone measurements and ground-based measurements of ultra-violet radiation. Based on analysis of 33 years of satellite records, {{we find that the}} ozone hole of 2012 was one of the least severe since the late 1980 s in terms of maximum area, minimum ozone level and total ozone deficit. In particular, the estimated integrated ozone mass effectively depleted within the ozone hole of 2012 was approximately 720 Mt, which is the 12 th smallest deficit on record and 28 per cent of the peak deficit observed in 2006. The key factor in limiting the extent of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in 2012 was the relatively warm temperatures that occurred in the Antarctic stratosphere from early July. These warm temperatures, which were driven by dynamical activity, limited the activation of ozone depletion chemistry within the polar vortex during {{the latter part of the}} polar winter. Additionally, dynamical disturbances to the polar cap region during spring were aided by the prevailing phase of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) which was strongly negative (westward) and favouring the poleward propagation of heat flux anomalies; these disturbances resulted in the steady erosion of the vortex and caused it to breakdown relatively early compared to recent years. The metrics for the Antarctic ozone hole of 2012 showed some similarity with those of 1988 and 2002 (which were years of anomalously small ozone holes) despite all three years having distinctly different QBO indices indicating variant strengths of the polar vortex (and severity of ozone loss) ...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, Antarctic surface climate has {{undergone}} pronounced changes. Many of these changes {{have been linked to}} stratospheric ozone depletion. Here linkages between <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>loss,</b> the accompanying circulation changes, and summertime Southern Hemisphere (SH) midlatitude surface temperatures are explored. Long-term surface climate changes associated with ozone-driven changes in the southern annular mode (SAM) at SH midlatitudes in summer are not annular in appearance owing to differences in regional circulation and precipitation impacts. Both station and reanalysis data indicate a trend toward cooler summer temperatures over southeast and south-central Australia and inland areas of the southern tip of Africa. It is also found that since the onset of the ozone hole, there have been significant shifts in the distributions of both the seasonal mean and daily maximum summertime temperatures in the SH midlatitude regions between high and low ozone years. Unusually hot summer extremes are associated with anomalously high ozone in the previous November, including the recent very hot austral summer of 2012 / 13. If the relationship found in {{the past three}} decades continues to hold, the level of late springtime ozone over Antarctica {{has the potential to be}} part of a useful predictor set for the following summer’s conditions. The results herein suggest that skillful predictions may be feasible for both the mean seasonal temperature and the frequency of extreme hot events in some SH midlatitude regions of Australia, Africa, and South America.

40|$|Polar stratospheric clouds (PSC's) provide {{surfaces}} for heterogeneous processes {{which can}} dramatically alter the normal partitioning of odd nitrogen and chlorine {{families in the}} winter polar stratospheres, setting up conditions for significant ozone depletion as manifested in the springtime <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> hole.

The Stratospheric Aerosol Measurement (SAM) 2 sensor, a single-channel (1 mu m) photometer launched into a Sun-synchronous orbit aboard the Nimbus 7 satellite in October 1978, provided a unique database to establish the climatology of PSC's. Poole and Pitts (1994) used the record of high-latitude aerosol extinction obtained by SAM II from 1979 - 1989 to establish the climatology of PSC occurrences in the Arctic and Antarctic.

40|$|Recently, the cosmic-ray-driven electron-induced {{reaction}} mechanism (CRE) {{was introduced to}} explain polar ozone depletion and surface temperature change. It was proposed that the dissociation of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) on ice surfaces of polar stratospheric clouds plays the dominant role in forming the ozone hole. Efforts {{have been made to}} predict polar <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in future years. It was further proposed that CFCs and cosmic-ray-driven ozone depletion may control global surface temperatures. These assertions challenge the fundamental understanding of <b>Antarctic</b> stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> and global warming. Here we show that these arguments based on the CRE mechanism are inconclusive. First, correlations of satellite data of CFC- 12, N 2 O and CH 4 from ACE-FTS show no evidence of significant loss of CFC- 12 as predicted by the CRE mechanism. Second, conclusions drawn about a possible CRE impact on the atmosphere, based on correlations of different observed atmospheric parameters, do not have a physical basis. Finally, predictions on the future development of the atmosphere based on these correlations are not reliable for either the ozone hole or global surface temperatures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> at isentropic levels between 450 K and 600 K is derived from the difference between observed ozone abundances and the ozone modelled considering diabatic cooling, but no chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>loss.</b> The results show chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> of up to 20 – 40 % between the beginning of January and the end of March inside the Arctic polar vortex.

40|$|The {{well-established}} "Match" {{approach to}} quantifying chemical destruction of ozone in the polar lower stratosphere {{is applied to}} ozone observations from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on NASA's Aura spacecraft. Quantification of <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> requires distinguishing transport- and chemically induced changes in ozone abundance. This is accomplished in the Match approach by examining cases where trajectories indicate that the same air mass has been observed on multiple occasions. The method was pioneered using ozonesonde observations, for which hundreds of matched ozone observations per winter are typically available. The dense coverage of the MLS measurements, particularly at polar latitudes, allows matches {{to be made to}} thousands of observations each day. This study is enabled by recently developed MLS Lagrangian trajectory diagnostic (LTD) support products. Sensitivity studies indicate that the largest influence on the <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> estimates are the value of potential vorticity (PV) used to define the edge of the polar vortex (within which matched observations must lie) {{and the degree to which}} the PV of an air mass is allowed to vary between matched observations. Applying Match calculations to MLS observations of nitrous oxide, a long-lived tracer whose expected rate of change is negligible on the weekly to monthly timescales considered here, enables quantification of the impact of transport errors on the Match-based <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> estimates. Our loss estimates are generally in agreement with previous estimates for selected Arctic winters, though indicating smaller losses than many other studies.

40|$|After the {{discovery}} of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> hole by Farman et al. (1985) the need for a complete understanding of stratospheric ozone chemistry and related dynamics became apparent. Since the early 1990 ties we concentrated our research on following questions: 1. Do similar <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> appear in the Arctic stratosphere? 2. How much ozone becomes depleted? 3. Is our understanding of the underlying chemical and dynamical processes correct? Only with a complete understanding the future of the ozone layer can be predicted. To answer the first two questions we developed a Lagrangian method, the so called Match method, to detect and to quantify <b>ozone</b> <b>losses.</b> By means of hundreds ozonesondes launched in near-real time coordination at several stations in the polar and sub-polar region during a winter season we were able to show that processes similar to those leading to the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> hole occur in the Arctic, too, and that the amount considerably varies from winter to winter.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the parameterisation {{of chemical and}} dynamical processes in the Antarctic stratosphere. Statistical models for the inter- and intra-annual variability in <b>Antarctic</b> stratospheric <b>ozone</b> depletion were developed based on theory {{and an understanding of}} the coupling of dynamics and chemistry in the atmosphere. It was confirmed that the primary driver of the long-term trend in the severity of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> hole is halogen loading in the stratosphere. The year-to-year variability in ozone mass deficit, a measure of the severity of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> depletion, could be described by a linear combination of South Pole temperatures and midlatitude wave activity. A time lag of two weeks between wave activity effects and ozone depletion indicates the predictive capability of meteorological parameters for seasonal projections of the severity of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> hole. The statistical model describing the inter-annual variability in ozone mass deficit was regressed against observations from 1979 to 2004. The resulting regression coefficients were applied to South Pole temperature and wave activity fields from 28 chemistry-climate models. This analysis indicates a slight increase in the year-to-year variability in the severity of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> depletion. As a prelude to analysing the seasonal evolution of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> depletion, an improved ozone mass deficit measure was derived by replacing the constant 220 DU threshold with a seasonal varying pre-ozone hole background which leads to better capturing the true extent of the depleted ozone. Furthermore, it was shown that the new measure represents the chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> within the <b>Antarctic</b> vortex provided that no mixing occurs through the vortex boundary. This new measure has many advantages over previous stratospheric ozone depletion indices. The conventional ozone mass deficit omits large amounts of depleted mass of ozone, and the onset of ozone depletion does not coincide with the timing of when sunlight first reaches areas of polar stratospheric clouds as expected from theory. Chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> derived with a tracer-tracer correlation technique depends on ozone and passive tracer profile measurements which are not as readily available as the total column ozone fields required for the new ozone mass deficit presented in this thesis. As such, the new ozone depletion measure combines the simplicity of the old ozone mass deficit index with higher accuracy of the actual amount of chemically depleted stratospheric ozone. Furthermore, when applying the new definition of ozone mass deficit to chemistry-climate model outputs, model intercomparisons should become easier to interpret because biases in the models can be avoided. Based on theory and understanding of the coupling of chemistry and dynamics in the Antarctic stratosphere, two semi-empirical models were developed to describe the intra-seasonal evolution of chlorine activation and ozone depletion. Regression of the models against chlorine monoxide and ozone mass deficit from observations results in coefficients that capture key sensitivities in the real atmosphere. The seasonal evolution of ozone mass deficit can be described with these coefficients and readily available meteorological fields (temperature and wind fields). The predictive capability of these models was demonstrated for 2005 and 2006. Given temperature and wind fields, which for example can be obtained from general circulation models, these models can predict the size and depth of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> hole. Important applications of the semi-empirical models could be chemistry-climate model validation by comparing the sensitivities from observations and models which may provide new insights into potential sources of differences in chemistry-climate model projections of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> depletion.

The <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Ozone</b> Hole (AOH) is a phenomenon of strong ozone depletion in the Antarctic stratosphere, this is a consequence of heterogeneous chemical reactions and dynamical processes which enhance <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> by reactions o o with chlorine. Punta Arenas (53. 0 S, 70. 9 W) is the southernmost city in Chile with a population of approximately 120000. Due to its location, well within the area affected by the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Ozone</b> Hole the ozone distribution is affected in different altitudes. Systematic observation of ozone and UV-B with a Brewer spectrophotometer have been made in order study during the ozone hole conditions.

40|$|The gas-phase {{reaction}} between BrO and CIO {{has been}} proposed as a potentially fast and synergistic mechanism of stratospheric ozone destruction. Further, it has been advanced 1 as a contributing factor to <b>Antarctic</b> springtime <b>ozone</b> column <b>losses</b> of ∼ 40 % from 1960 to 1985 2, 3 Both dynamical 4 and chemical theories 1, 5 - 8 have been advanced to explain {{the formation of the}} Antarctic 'ozone hole'. A major uncertainty in these theories has been the rate constant and product distribution of the BrO + ClO reaction as a function of temperature. Here we report the first direct measurements of these parameters. We show that this reaction could, indeed, account for a large fraction of the springtime ozone depletion over Antarctica and provide a source of chlorine dioxide of sufficient magnitude to explain the recent measurements of this species in the Antarctic stratosphere, provided that the stratosphere contains a sufficient quantity of bromine (∼ 20 p. p. t. v.). © 1987 Nature Publishing Group...|$|R
40|$|In 2011, {{several groups}} {{reported}} dramatic ozone depletion over the arctic polar region approaching {{that of the}} <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> hole. Odin, The Swedish-led satellite project in collaboration with Canada, France and Finland, was launched in February 2001 and continues to produce profiles of chemical species relevant to understanding {{the middle and upper}} atmosphere. This study concerns <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> over the northern pole utilizing the 12 years of ozone data from Odin/SMR. The unstable nature of the arctic vortex due to the propagation of planetary waves from troposphere makes quantifying chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in the arctic more difficult. The assimilation technique using a transport model is useful for separating the dynamical and chemical changes in the ozone amount as demonstrated earlier by Roseval et al (2007). We have applied this method with a number of improvements to study the inter-annual variability during the entire Odin period...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} from the chlorine and bromine {{species in the}} formation of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> hole is evaluated. Since chlorine and bromine compounds are of different industrial origin, it is desirable, from a policy point of view, to be able to attribute chlorine-catalyzed <b>loss</b> of <b>ozone</b> with those reactions directly involving chlorine species, and likewise for bromine-catalyzed loss. In the stratosphere, however, most of the chemical families are highly coupled, and, for example, changes in the chlorine abundance will alter the partitioning in other families and thus the rate of <b>ozone</b> <b>loss.</b> This modeling study examines formation of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> hole for a wide range of bromine concentrations (5 – 25 pptv) and for chlorine concentrations typical of the last two decades (1. 5, 2. 5 and 3. 5 ppbv). We follow the photochemical evolution of a single parcel of air, typical of the inner Antarctic vortex (50 mbar, 70 °S, NO y = 2 ppbv, with polar stratospheric clouds(PSC)) from August 1 to November 1. For all of these ranges of chlorine and bromine loading, we would predict a substantial ozone hole (local depletion greater than 90 %) within the de-nitrified, PSC-perturbed vortex. The contributions of the different catalytic cycles responsible for <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> are tabulated. The deep minimum in ozone is driven primarily by the chlorine abundance. As bromine levels decrease, the magnitude of the chlorine-catalyzed <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> increases to take up the slack. This is because bromine suppresses ClO by accelerating the conversion of ClO and Cl 2 O 2  back to HCl. For this range of conditions, the local relative efficiency of ozone destruction per bromine atom to that per chlorine atom (α-factor) ranges from 33 to 55, decreasing with increase of bromine...|$|R
40|$|The Arctic winter 2010 / 2011 was {{characterized}} by an unusually stable and cold polar vortex in the lower stratosphere. Meteorological data shows that conditions {{for the formation of}} polar stratospheric clouds, and hence the activation of chlorine from reservoir species through heterogeneous processes, were widespread. Values of Vpsc, a temperature based parameter that characterizes the winter average extent of such conditions were in the range of the extreme values reached in the coldest winters on record, i. e., 2000 and 2005. However, in contrast to these previous winters, when the <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> period was ended by major stratospheric warmings in March, in 2011 the very stable polar vortex stayed intact and cold well into April. The combination of extremely cold conditions throughout the winter with a long lived and stable vortex in spring led to record chemical destruction of ozone in the Arctic. Based on the measurements of the Match ozonesonde network and the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument on Aura we will discuss the degree and the time evolution of this record loss and compare the Arctic <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in 2011 with the range of <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> that occurred in early and recent <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> holes...|$|R
40|$|Reduced {{quantities}} of ozone {{in the atmosphere}} allow greater levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation to reach the earth's surface. The 1992 / 1993 project goals for the Virginia Tech Senior Design Team were to 1) understand the processes which contribute to stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>loss,</b> 2) examine ways to prevent <b>ozone</b> <b>loss,</b> and 3) define the requirements for an implementation vehicle {{to carry out the}} prevention scheme. A scheme proposed by R. J. Cicerone, el al late in 1991 was selected because of its supporting research and economic feasibility. This scheme uses hydrocarbon injected into the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> hole to form stable compounds with free chlorine, thus reducing ozone depletion. A study of the hydrocarbon injection requirements determined that 130 aircraft traveling Mach 2. 4 at a maximum altitude of 66, 000 ft. would provide the most economic approach to preventing <b>ozone</b> <b>loss.</b> Each aircraft would require an 8, 000 nm. range and be able to carry 35, 000 lbs. of propane.

40|$|Several recent {{observational}} {{and laboratory}} studies of {{processes involved in}} polar stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> have prompted a reexamination of aspect of out understanding for this key indicator of global change. To a large extent, our confidence in understanding and projecting changes in polar and global ozone is based on our ability to to simulate these process in numerical models of chemistry and transport. These models depend on laboratory-measured kinetic reaction rates and photlysis cross section to simulate molecular interactions. In this study we use a simple box-model scenario for <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> to estimate the uncertainty in loss attributable to known reaction kinetic uncertainties. Following the method of earlier work, rates and uncertainties from the latest laboratory evaluation are applied in random combinations. We determine the key reaction and rates contributing the largest potential errors and compare the results to observations to evaluate which combinations are consistent with atmospheric data.

40|$|Stratospheric ozone {{profiles}} are retrieved for {{the period}} 2002 – 2009 from SCIAMACHY measurements of limb-scattered solar radiation in the Hartley and Chappuis absorption bands of ozone. This data set is {{used to determine the}} chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> in both the Arctic and Antarctic polar vortices by averaging the ozone in the vortex at a given potential temperature. The chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> at isentropic levels between 450 K and 600 K are derived from the difference between observed ozone abundances and the ozone modelled taking diabatic cooling into account, but no chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>loss.</b> Chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> of up to 30 – 40 % between mid-January and the end of March inside the Arctic polar vortex are reported. Strong inter-annual variability of the Arctic <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> is observed, with the cold winters 2004 / 2005 and 2006 / 2007 showing chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> inside the polar vortex at 475 K, where 1. 7 ppmv and 1. 4 ppmv of ozone were removed, respectively, over the period from 22 January to beginning of April and 0. 9 ppmv and 1. 2 ppmv, respectively, during February. For the winters of 2007 / 2008 and 2002 / 2003, <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> of about 0. 8 ppmv and 0. 4 ppmv, respectively are estimated at the 475 K isentropic level {{for the period}} from 22 January to beginning of April. Essentially no <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> were diagnosed for the relatively warm winters of 2003 / 2004 and 2005 / 2006. The maximum <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in the SCIAMACHY data set was found in 2007 at the 600 K level and amounted to about 2. 1 ppmv for the period between 22 January and the end of April. Enhanced losses close to this altitude were found in all investigated Arctic springs, in contrast to Antarctic spring. The inter-annual variability of <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> and PSC occurrence rates observed during Arctic spring is consistent with the known QBO effects on the Arctic polar vortex, with exception of the unusual Arctic winter 2008 / 2009. The maximum total <b>ozone</b> mass <b>loss</b> of about 25 million tons was found in the cold Arctic winter of 2004 / 2005 inside the polar vortex between the 450 K and 600 K isentropic levels from mid-January until the middle of March. The <b>Antarctic</b> vortex averaged <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> as well as the size of the polar vortex do not vary much from year to year. The total <b>ozone</b> mass <b>loss</b> inside the Antarctic polar vortex between the 450 K and 600 K isentropic levels is about 50 – 60 million tons and the vortex volume for this altitude range varies between about 150 and 300 km 3 for the period between mid-August and mid-November of every year studied, except for 2002. In 2002 a mid-winter major stratospheric warming occurred {{in the second half of}} September and the <b>ozone</b> mass <b>loss</b> was only about half of the value in the other years. However, inside the polar vortex we find chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> at the 475 K isentropic level that are similar to those in all other years studied. At this isentropic level <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> of 70 – 90 % between mid-August and mid-November or about 2. 5 ppmv are observed every year. At isentropic levels above 500 K the chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> were found to be larger in 2002 than in all other years studied. Comparisons of the vertical variation of <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> derived from SCIAMACHY observations with several independent techniques for the Arctic winter 2004 / 2005 show that the SCIAMACHY results fall in the middle of the range of previously published results for this winter. For other winters in both hemispheres – for which comparisons with other studies were possible – the SCIAMACHY results are consistent with the range of previously published results...|$|R

40|$|Calculations of {{equivalent}} {{length from}} an artificial advected tracer provide new {{insight into the}} isentropic transport processes occurring within the Antarctic stratospheric vortex. These calculations show two distinct regions of approximately equal area: a strongly mixed vortex core and a broad ring of weakly mixed air extending out to the vortex boundary. This broad ring of vortex air remains isolated from the core between late winter and midspring. Satellite measurements of stratospheric H 2 O confirm that the isolation lasts until at least mid-October. A three-dimensional chemical transport model simulation of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> hole quantifies the <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> within this ring and demonstrates its isolation. In contrast to the vortex core, <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in the weakly mixed broad ring is not complete. The reasons are twofold. First, warmer temperatures in the broad ring prevent continuous polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) formation and the associated chemical processing (i. e., the conversion of unreactive chlorine into reactive forms). Second, the isolation prevents ozone-rich air from the broad ring mixing with chemically processed air from the vortex core. If the stratosphere continues to cool, this will lead to increased PSC formation and more complete chemical processing in the broad ring. Despite the expected decline in halocarbons, sensitivity studies suggest that this mechanism will lead to enhanced <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in the weakly mixed region, delaying the future recovery of the ozone hole. ...|$|R
