25|$|Once {{the supply}} of spare parts had been assured by mid-season, the B186s were {{modified}} to incorporate a whole array of new aerodynamic features (including front and rear wings and a revised underbody), new suspension packages and revised setup concepts. The chassis was also strengthened further {{to cope with the}} stress caused by the power of the BMW engine. The development package was completed by the arrival of a new rear wing design for the Austrian Grand Prix, where the improved performance of the B186 and the high-speed Österreichring circuit made it the fastest car in the field with Fabi (pole) and Berger occupying the front row of the grid. The car's competitiveness improved throughout the season, particularly during the second half, {{as a result of this}} development. In addition, it also became more reliable, although this aspect remained suspect throughout the year with a total of nineteen retirements from 32 starts. The competitiveness of the Pirelli tyres also improved, and their relative durability compared to the Goodyears often played to the B186's advantage, exemplified by the fact that Berger won the 1986 Mexican Grand Prix due to not having to make a pit stop for a fresh set of tyres while most of the main contenders (with the exception of Prost's McLaren which finished 2nd) made at least two stops for tyres due to the <b>abrasive</b> <b>surface</b> of the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez.|$|E

50|$|Both {{manually}} and {{electrically powered}} mills are available. These mills grind the coffee to a fairly uniform size {{determined by the}} separation of the two <b>abrasive</b> <b>surfaces</b> between which the coffee is ground; the uniform grind produces a more even extraction when brewed, without excessively fine particles that clog filters.|$|R

50|$|A burr mill, or burr grinder, is a mill used {{to grind}} hard, small food {{products}} between two revolving <b>abrasive</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{separated by a}} distance usually set by the user. When the two surfaces are set far apart, the resulting ground material is coarser. When the two surfaces are set closer together, the resulting ground material is finer and smaller. Often, the device includes a revolving screw that pushes the food through. It may be powered electrically or manually.|$|R
50|$|The circuit was {{completely}} resurfaced in 2004 and this saw almost all lap records broken {{in the first}} few months of 2004. The surface changed from an <b>abrasive</b> <b>surface</b> which was renowned for being very hard on tyres to a grippy, smooth surface.|$|E
50|$|The Glass {{nail file}} is a nail {{file with the}} <b>abrasive</b> <b>surface</b> made of glass used to gently grind down and shape the edges of fingernails. They are often used in manicures and pedicures after the nail has been trimmed using {{appropriate}} nail clippers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{internal}} magnetic <b>abrasive</b> particles <b>surface</b> finishing, {{the motion}} of magnetic abrasive particles was influenced {{not only by the}} intensity of magnetic induction, but also by the internal diameter, and the magnetic inductive capacity was also an important factor that influences finishing quality. In this paper, under the same experimental conditions, electromagnetic field and permanent magnetic field were respectively used to magnetic <b>abrasive</b> particles <b>surface</b> finishing on thin stainless steel bush and 45 steel bush, new thoughts on inserted permanent magnetic pole and butted permanent magnetic pole were pointed out. The finishing quality of two kinds of work pieces under three different magnetic poles was compared. The results have shown that permanent magnetic pole could decrease the surface roughness Ra of work piece from 1. 6 μm to 0. 2 μm, which could solve the puzzles encountered in internal magnetic <b>abrasive</b> particles <b>surface</b> finishing on magnetic inductive work piece and had good promising application value...|$|R

50|$|Glass {{nail files}} are more {{recently}} available. Since glass nail files have a smoother and more even surface {{they do not}} splinter the nail like emery boards or metal nail files.

High concentrate diets should be fed carefully to avoid acidosis.

50|$|Salt, pepper, {{and spice}} mills, {{essentially}} the same as coffee mills, usually do not have a handle, the entire top rotating instead. While this is less convenient, only a few turns are required to grind enough. The ground product falls directly onto the food being seasoned; the mill has no container. A few designs have <b>abrasive</b> <b>surfaces</b> which do not rotate; each squeeze of the handles moves one flat plate past another, then the plates are restored to their original position by a spring. Many hard spices are available in containers incorporating a simple cone burr grinder, intended to be discarded when empty.|$|R
50|$|After 20 years, {{the track}} will undergo its first repave {{following}} the 2018 race weekend.

50|$|A {{photographic}} album, or photo album, is {{a collection}} of photographs, generally in a book. Some book-form photo albums have compartments which the photos may be slipped into; other albums have heavy paper with an <b>abrasive</b> <b>surface</b> covered with clear plastic sheets, on which surface photos can be put. Older style albums often were simply books of heavy paper which photos could be glued to or attached to with adhesive corners or pages.|$|E

50|$|The Martindale method, {{also known}} as the Martindale rub test, simulates natural wear of a seat cover, where the textile sample is rubbed against a {{standard}} <b>abrasive</b> <b>surface</b> with a specified force. The test equipment works in intervals of 5000 cycles, totalling the wear number (unit: Martindale) of abrasion cycles that leads to the material being worn to a specified degree.

More commonly, friction with abrasive surfaces, including clothing, carpet, or rope, can lead to a friction burn. Common places at which skin-to-skin chafing can occur are between the thighs and under the armpits. Friction burns are very common with clothing such as trousers on the knees caused by playing sport or sliding on wooden surfaces.|$|E
50|$|The high {{temperatures}} in Malaysia and the <b>abrasive</b> <b>surface</b> of the Sepang circuit led to tyre supplier Pirelli making predictions of high wear rates throughout qualifying {{and the race}} {{to the extent that}} pit stop strategy would be the deciding factor in the outcome.

40|$|Good surface {{integrity}} is frequently required of structural ceramic components, since {{the lifetime of}} a ceramic component is, in most cases, determined by its surface features. In this study, two mechanical surface treatments, i. e. ultrasonic and <b>abrasive</b> blasting <b>surface</b> finishing, have been introduced {{to the surface of}} electrodischarge machined ceramic composites to improve their surface integrity. The surface roughness, hardness, and topography of the ceramic composites were examined after electrodischarge machining (EDM) and surface treatment.

Results show that ultrasonic and <b>abrasive</b> blasting <b>surface</b> finishing can produce an improvement in both flexural strength and Weibull modulus, and are two effective procedures to improve the surface integrity of the EDM ceramic composites.

40|$|In {{early summer}} 2001, an {{outbreak}} of atypical rash occurred among children from 24 junior schools who attended an outdoor games event. The event comprised a series of five water games including a water slide, and within 24 hours of attending the event 151 / 593 (26 %) children developed a papulopustular rash. The rash had a characteristic distribution, predominantly over the lower trunk and buttocks, with some involvement of the arms and legs. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from a water butt used to draw water for the games, and from the tank of a fire engine that supplied the water.
