We were all {{struggling}} to find our chemistry together, and as a result, the experience of making and promoting this was tense and unenjoyable. Ironically, our shows were selling out every night. But after <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>we</b> decided {{that we needed to}} go home to lick our wounds." ...|$|E

He commented that she was [...] "dazzling, and the most understanding woman on this earth" [...] who [...] "brought out the Gaelic in him", being half Irish. Quinn implied that they had been involved in an affair, adding that [...] "after <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>we</b> both tired of the deceit".|$|E
500|$|Kenny also {{provided}} {{the voice of}} Gary, SpongeBob's meowing sea snail, and the narrator in the episode. According to him, [...] "It was always Steve's intention that the narrator be a nod to his beloved Jacques Cousteau." [...] Kenny described Cousteau's voice as [...] "very dispassionate, very removed, very flatline, even when he’s describing something miraculous and beautiful." [...] At first, {{they found that the}} narrator [...] "just sounds bored," [...] so they decided that he [...] "has to sound a little fun and playful." [...] Kenny said, [...] "'Eet ees the most amazing thing I have ever seen I have ever seen in my life.' We found that after <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>we</b> had to make the narrator a little more playful than that." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2009, Janet Jackson {{performed}} [...] "Scream" [...] on the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards {{as part of}} {{a medley}} tribute to Michael Jackson, who died three months earlier. MTV General Manager Stephen Friedman stated [...] "his is not something that just came together—we've been in talks with [...] for <b>a</b> <b>while...</b> <b>We</b> felt there was no one better than Janet to anchor it and send a really powerful message." [...] She worked with several world-renowned choreographers, including Dave Scott, Cris Judd, Brian Friedman, Wade Robson, Tyce Diorio, Travis Payne, Jeri Slaughter, Laurie Ann Gibson, Mia Michaels and Tina Landon, with her personal creative director, Gil Duldulao, coordinating the performance. Gil Kaufman of MTV commented [...] "earing a black-and-white, skintight leather dress with matching pants, Janet busted some of her and Michael's signature moves, flawlessly re-creating her late brother's steps as they were projected on the screen behind her." [...] Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly commented, [...] "she worked that stage harder than an underpaid assistant doin’ overtime, and as tributes go, this was as energetic as it was heartfelt." ...|$|E
500|$|On 11 December 2012, she {{announced}} through her Facebook account {{that she did}} not get to finish some of the projects she was working on in New York and that she was collaborating in the studio with The Struts in Sweden. The singer decided to use the vocals she recorded for the demo on the song because her vocal performance [...] "was really coming from the heart". The Struts co-wrote, produced and programmed the track, and additionally played the keys. Filip Runesson played the strings, with Lars Norgren mixing the song and Björn Engelmann mastering it. In an interview with Coup de Main magazine, Lo said that: [...] " [...] my way of getting through a hard time in 'the best' possible way. It's a big relief to just think 'fuck it all' for <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> <b>We</b> all have to be so perfect, and absolutely no one can live up to it." [...] She later confessed to The Huffington Post that she recovered from the break-up after writing the song.|$|E
500|$|After a Week 8 bye, Hester caught four {{passes for}} 42 yards {{and had an}} 11-yard run against the Detroit Lions. He {{eventually}} lost his kick return duties to Danieal Manning, but began receiving more playing time as a wide receiver. Between Week 12 and 15, Hester caught 17 passes for 250 yards and one touchdown. David Haugh of the Chicago Tribune regarded Hester as the team's [...] "biggest threat in the passing game." [...] He concluded the season by catching 51 passes for a team high 665 yards. Unlike his previous two seasons in the NFL, Hester did not record a single touchdown return and only averaged 6.2 yards per punt return. Lovie Smith commented on Hester {{at the end of}} the season by saying, [...] "I know his returns dropped off a little bit this year, but his plate was full there for <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> <b>We</b> think we have a happy medium now for him as a punt returner and continuing to develop as a receiver." [...] Hester was also selected to play in the 2009 Pro Bowl as a third alternate.|$|E

500|$|For a brief period, McDonald and Melton {{performed}} {{together as}} a duo at college campuses in the Northwest on behalf of Students for a Democratic Society before returning as regulars at the Jabberwock cafe. The two were joined by local jug band musicians, including Melton's roommates, bass player Bruce Barthol and guitarist Paul Armstrong, and bluegrass guitarist David Bennett Cohen, with whom Melton played in another jug band. The addition of drummer John Francis-Gunning rounded out the six-piece ensemble. It was during their residency at the Jabberwock that Country Joe and the Fish learned to play as a group and expand their repertoire. Within months, based on McDonald and Melton's interest in the live performances of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, the recordings on Bob Dylan's album, Highway 61 Revisited, and {{their use of the}} mind-altering drug LSD, the group began equipping themselves with electric instruments and delving more into psychedelia. As a result, Cohen was moved over to the organ. Cohen's experience with keyboards was limited to having played piano at a semiprofessional capacity at the Jabberwock, but, nonetheless, he quickly adapted to the qualities of the instrument. Melton describes the change of the group: [...] "Once we hit into the electric medium and into the rock medium, we were pandering to the public taste. We became extraordinarily popular. The little folk club where we used to play once every two weeks, we played every single night for a month, or something like that, and filled it. And after <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>we</b> filled two shows every single night".|$|E
2500|$|The phrase [...] "our first Black president" [...] {{was adopted}} as a {{positive}} by Bill Clinton supporters. When the Congressional Black Caucus honored the former president at its dinner in Washington D.C. on September 29, 2001, for instance, Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX), the chair, told the audience that Clinton [...] "took so many initiatives he made us think for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>we</b> had elected the first black president." ...|$|E
2500|$|Curtis {{was married}} six times. His first wife was actress Janet Leigh, {{to whom he}} was married from 1951 to 1962, and with whom he fathered actresses Kelly and Jamie Lee. [...] "For <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>we</b> were Hollywood's golden couple," [...] he said. [...] "I was very {{dedicated}} and devoted to Janet, {{and on top of}} my trade, but in her eyes that goldenness started to wear off. I realized that whatever I was, I wasn't enough for Janet. That hurt me a lot and broke my heart." ...|$|E

We fished for the pacu as the native does, kneading a ball of mandioc farina with water and placing it on the hook as bait. I should not be surprised, though, if it were possible, with carefully chosen flies, to catch some of the fish that every once in <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>we</b> saw rise {{to the surface and}} drag some luckless insect under." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{recording}} subsequently drew {{comment from}} the entire band; other than the composer (McCartney), none appear to have fond memories of their work on the song: Lennon said [...] "I was ill after the accident when they did most of that track, and it really ground George and Ringo into the ground recording it", adding later [...] "I hate it, 'cos all I remember is the track... did everything {{to make it into}} a single, and it never was and it never could have been." [...] Harrison characterised the song as [...] "fruity" [...] and commented [...] "we spent {{a hell of a lot}} of time on it", and later [...] "after <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>we</b> did a good job on it". Starr added retrospective input on the finished result in a Rolling Stone article from 2008: [...] "The worst session ever was 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer.' It was the worst track we ever had to record. It went on for fucking weeks. I thought it was mad." [...] McCartney recalled: [...] "The only arguments were about things like me spending three days on Maxwell's Silver Hammer. I remember George saying, 'You've taken three days, it's only a song.' – 'Yeah, but I want to get it right. I've got some thoughts on this one.' It was early-days Moog work and it did take a bit of time".|$|E
2500|$|... “There were a {{great many}} cowboys with the show. [...] There was a chief of the cowboys who had general {{supervision}} over both horses and men. [...] When an unbroken horse would be brought in, this cowboy chief would give it to an Indian to ride bareback. [...] After the animal was well broken, it would {{be taken away from}} the Indian and given to a cowboy to ride. [...] Then the Indian would be given another unbroken horse. [...] For <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>we</b> said nothing about it, but finally it began to be just a little too much to stand. [...] One day one of the Indians came to me just before it was time to enter the arena. [...] His horse was saddled and bridled, but he was leading the horse by the bridle. [...] I asked him what was the matter, and {{he said it was a}} wild horse and he was not going to ride it into the arena. [...] I went to the chief cowboy and said, ‘I do not think you are doing right. [...] You know our Indian boys have to ride bareback, but you always give them the wild horses to ride. [...] Then, when they have the horse nicely broken, you give to a cowboy. [...] Why don’t you give the wild horses to the cowboys to break in? [...] They ride on saddles, and it would not be so hard for them.’ [...] But the chief cowboy only said, “Well, I can’t be bothered by a little thing like that. [...] You will have to see Buffalo Bill about the horses.’ [...] But I retorted, “You know very well that Buffalo Bill does not know what you do with the horses. [...] He does not know that you give the wild ones to the Indian boys to ride until they are broken in. [...] Give that horse back to that Indian boy or he will not go into the arena today.’ [...] That was all, but the boy got his horse in time to enter the arena with the others. [...] Just as I was ready to go back to the Indians, I looked at Buffalo Bill, and he had a twinkle in his eye. [...] After that, we had no more trouble with the horses. [...] Although Buffalo Bill never said anything to me, I knew he had fixed things to our satisfaction.” ...|$|E
