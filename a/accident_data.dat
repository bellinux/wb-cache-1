30|$|Lee et al. [3] {{indicated}} that statistical models {{were a good}} choice {{in the past to}} analyze road accidents to identify the correlation between accident and other traffic and geometric factors. However, Chen and Jovanis [4] determined that analyzing large dimensional datasets using traditional statistical techniques may result in certain problems such as sparse data in large contingency tables. Also, statistical models have their own model specific assumptions and violation of these can lead to some erroneous results. Due to these limitations of statistical techniques, data mining techniques are being used to analyze road <b>accidents.</b> <b>Data</b> mining is a set of techniques to extract novel, implicit and hidden information from large data. Barai [5] discussed that there are various applications of data mining in transportation engineering such as road roughness analysis, pavement analysis and road <b>accident</b> analysis. Various <b>data</b> mining techniques [6] such as association rule mining, classification and clustering are widely used for the analysis of road accidents.|$|R
