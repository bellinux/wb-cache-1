3000|$|..., it can {{be assumed}} {{that there are more}} <b>announcements</b> <b>on</b> Days (− 1), (0) and (+ 1) than on other days around these days. Moreover, since {{observations}} in Sample A match the results from Expected Announcements, it may be stated that there are more <b>announcements</b> <b>on</b> Days (− 1), (0) and (+ 1) than it would be expected under normal conditions, that is, if there were no Events matching the criteria set through the Event Detection process. Results on Day (0) represent <b>announcements</b> <b>on</b> Detected Event Dates. So, it may also be stated, that, in fact, transaction dates included in Day (− 1), (0) and (+ 1) observations have a higher informational value than the rest of observations. It is reasonable to conclude thus that the Event Detection process which produced dates used for forming observations on Day (0) was in fact successful.|$|R
