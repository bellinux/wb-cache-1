40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{the incidence of}} alloimmunization in sickle cell disease patients, as well as autoantibodies and the phenotypic profile of these patients for the following erythrocyte antigen groups: Rh, Kell, Kidd, Duffy and MNS. Methods: fifty-seven patients were evaluated during follow-up at the Anemia Outpatient Clinic of Irmandade da Santa Casa de São Paulo, where a search for irregular antibodies and phenotyping was carried out. Results: Patients&# 8217; median alloimmunization age in sickle cell disease was 25 years, and irregular antibodies were found in 22. 6 % of them. <b>Anti-Kell</b> <b>antibody</b> was the most frequent (7. 5 %) followed by anti-C (5. 7 %). Conclusion: The prevalence of alloimmunization and of patients with autoantibodies among individuals with sickle cell disease followed at the Anemia Outpatient Clinic of Irmandade da Santa Casa de Misericórdia de São de Paulo was determined. The risk of alloimmunization was higher in patients who received more than 3 red blood cell units in the past 2 years. The most prevalent alloantibodies were anti-Kell and anti-C...|$|E
40|$|Hemolytic {{disease of}} the fetus and newborn is a common {{consideration}} in newborn medicine, especially among the jaundiced. Maternal breastmilk provides numerous benefits to the infant, including nutrition and immunologic factors. Here, we present an infant who received three intrauterine transfusions for anemia secondary to anti-K 1 (Kell), anti-C, and anti-e antibodies and whose maternal breastmilk tested positive for <b>anti-Kell</b> <b>antibodies.</b> The infant required another transfusion at 4 weeks of life for anemia. We review the pathophysiology of <b>anti-Kell</b> <b>antibodies,</b> the immunology of breast milk, and the intersection of these two topics...|$|R
50|$|Mothers who are {{negative}} for the Kell1 antigen develop antibodies after {{being exposed to}} red blood cells that are positive for Kell1. Over half of the cases of hemolytic disease of the newborn owing the <b>anti-Kell</b> <b>antibodies</b> are caused by multiple blood transfusions, with the remainder due to a previous pregnancy with a Kell1 positive baby.|$|R
50|$|Autoimmune {{hemolytic}} anemia (AIHA) {{occurs when the}} body produces an antibody against a blood group antigen on its own red blood cells. The antibodies lead to destruction of the red blood cells with resulting anemia. Similarly, a pregnant woman may develop antibodies against fetal red blood cells, resulting in destruction, anemia, and hydrops fetalis in {{a process known as}} hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). Both AIHA and HDN may be severe when caused by <b>anti-Kell</b> <b>antibodies,</b> as they are the most immunogenic antigens after those of the ABO and Rhesus blood group systems.|$|R
50|$|The disease {{results when}} {{maternal}} antibodies to Kell1 are {{transferred to the}} fetus across the placental barrier, breaching immune privilege. These antibodies can cause severe anemia by interfering with the early proliferation of red blood cells as well as causing alloimmune hemolysis. Very severe disease can occur as early as 20 weeks gestation. Hydrops fetalis can also occur early. The finding of <b>anti-Kell</b> <b>antibodies</b> in an antenatal screening blood test (indirect Coombs test) is an indication for early referral to a specialist service for assessment, management and treatment.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that IgG anti-Kell1 antibody injections would prevent sensitization to RBC surface Kell1 antigens {{in a similar}} way that IgG anti-D antibodies (Rho(D) Immune Globulin) are used to prevent Rh disease, but the methods for IgG <b>anti-Kell</b> 1 <b>antibodies</b> have not been developed at the present time.|$|R
5000|$|... "In only 2 {{situations}} are patients not monitored identically {{to patients who}} are Rh sensitized. The first is that of alloimmunization to the c, E, or, C antigens. Some concern exists that hemolysis may occur in these patients with a lower than 1:16 titer. Thus, if the initial titer is 1:4 and stable but increases at 26 weeks' gestation to 1:8, assessment with MCA Doppler velocity at that point is reasonable. However, if the patient presents in the first trimester with a 1:8 titer that remains stable at 1:8 throughout the second trimester, continued serial antibody titers are appropriate.The second situation in which patients should not be treated identically to patients who are Rh D sensitized is that of Kell isoimmunization because several cases of severe fetal hemolysis with <b>anti-Kell</b> <b>antibodies</b> {{have occurred in the}} setting of low titers." ...|$|R
