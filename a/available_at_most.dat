25|$|Economic water {{scarcity}} {{is caused by}} a lack of investment in infrastructure or technology to draw water from rivers, aquifers or other water sources, or insufficient human capacity to satisfy the demand for water. One quarter of the world's population is affected by economic {{water scarcity}}. Economic water scarcity includes a lack of infrastructure, causing the people without reliable access to water to have to travel long distances to fetch water, that is often contaminated from rivers for domestic and agricultural uses. Large parts of Africa suffer from economic water scarcity; developing water infrastructure in those areas could therefore help to reduce poverty. Critical conditions often arise for economically poor and politically weak communities living in already dry environment. Consumption increases with GDP per capita in most developed countries the average amount is around 200–300 litres daily. In underdeveloped (e.g. African countries such as Mozambique, average daily water consumption per capita was below 10 L. This is against the backdrop of international organisations, which recommend a minimum of 20 L of water (not including the water needed for washing clothes), <b>available</b> <b>at</b> <b>most</b> 1km from the household. Increased water consumption is correlated with increasing income, as measured by GDP per capita. In countries suffering from water shortages water is the subject of speculation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{microfauna}} {{found on}} live rock are detrivores and herbivores (as they eat algae and fish waste), and provide fish with a natural, attractive shelter.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugos are a rare sight since they were never popular in that republic because of a Volkswagen car plant near Sarajevo, with Volkswagen Golf being the choice of an affordable but reliable car.|$|E
