5|$|Zimbabwe has {{relatively}} well-developed {{national infrastructure}} and a long-standing tradition of promoting {{research and development}} (R), <b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> levy imposed on tobacco-growers since the 1930s to promote market research.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Akkadian Empire, Hurrians began to settle in the city and its surroundings, and by c. 1725 BC they {{constituted}} a sizable portion of the population. The presence of a large Hurrian population brought Hurrian culture and religion to Halab, <b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> existence of certain religious festivals that bear Hurrian names.|$|E
5|$|As the Great Depression wore on, Art Deco {{emerged as}} a popular {{building}} style, <b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Post Office building downtown. Art Deco consisted of streamlined concrete faced appearance with smooth stone or metal, with terracotta, and trimming consisting of glass and colored tiles.|$|E
25|$|The {{temple was}} covered with roof plates, <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that there were}} no remains of roof tiles and no traces of lead roof. The cornice, which has not been {{preserved}} in its original form, was probably made of a series of roughly dressed stone stabs.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, German war {{photographer}} Frauke Eigen {{created an}} exhibition about the clothing and belongings {{of the victims}} of ethnic cleansing in the Kosovo War.

5|$|In technology, medicine, and mathematics, ancient Egypt {{achieved}} {{a relatively high}} standard of productivity and sophistication. Traditional empiricism, <b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Edwin Smith and Ebers papyri (c. 1600BC), is first credited to Egypt. The Egyptians created their own alphabet and decimal system.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{of these}} patients is grim with untreated patients having an extremely short survival. The severity of liver disease (<b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> MELD score) {{has been shown to}} be a determinant of outcome. Some patients without cirrhosis develop HRS, with an incidence of about 20% seen in one study of ill patients with alcoholic hepatitis.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian {{independence}} was limited severely by the continuing British {{occupation of the}} country. British influence remained pervasive, <b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942, which almost led to Farouk I's forced abdication. In October 1951, Prime Minister Mustafa el-Nahhas introduced, and Parliament approved, decrees unilaterally abrogating the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 and proclaiming Farouk I King of Egypt and the Sudan. The move was intended to further Egypt's claims over Sudan, which had been governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium since 1899.|$|E
50|$|In late 2007, an FBI lab report {{surfaced}} which {{concluded that}} Stano {{could not have}} been the source of unidentified Caucasian pubic hairs that were recovered from Scharf's body. The report was never presented <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> public defender representing Stano. The source of the pubic hairs was not identified, and they were destroyed shortly after Stano's execution in the Florida electric chair in 1998.|$|R

50|$|Maceratino {{is a white}} Italian {{wine grape}} variety that is grown {{predominantly}} in the Marche along the Adriatic coast of Italy. Ampelographers believe the grape may have some relation to Greco and Verdicchio, <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> several overlapping synonyms, but no definitive link has been proven yet. For most of the 20th century, and into the 21st century, plantings of Maceratino have been declining and becoming increasingly rare.|$|R
5|$|Horton Hatches the Egg {{has been}} used in discussions {{on a wide variety of}} topics e.g., economics, Christianity, feminism, and adoption. James Kemp, a retired United Methodist pastor, {{compared}} Horton to the early Christians to whom the First Epistle of Peter was addressed. Like those early Christians, Horton faces persecution and ridicule for his actions, but Horton is faithful to his mission and is rewarded, <b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> elephant-bird that hatches at the end of the book.|$|E
5|$|In 1699 a Spanish {{expedition}} {{under the}} command of sergeant Martín de Montoya was sent from the Spanish garrison at Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza (formerly Nojpetén) to investigate Indian activity in the former Ch'ol and Mopan territories. He found evidence that there were still surviving Maya in all the lands he crossed, <b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> carefully tended cacao and vanilla orchards. At this time there were said to be 400 relocated Maya from the same area living in Belén.|$|E
5|$|More recent classifications, the 2006 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and Pediatric Rheumatology Society (PReS) classification, include palpable purpura as a {{mandatory}} criterion, together {{with at least}} one of the following findings: diffuse abdominal pain, predominant IgA deposition (confirmed on skin biopsy), acute arthritis in any joint, and renal involvement (<b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> presence of blood and/or protein in the urine).|$|E
5000|$|Research by Jean Golding {{shows that}} puberty is {{occurring}} earlier {{than in the}} 1970s, {{with an average age}} of menarche in girls now at 12 years and 10 months, compared to the average age of 14 for puberty in general that was accepted <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Policy Advisory Committee of the 1970s. Golding’s research has found that [...] "one girl in six hits puberty at the age of eight".|$|R
50|$|The recent {{excavations}} dating copper mining to the 10th century BCE {{also discovered}} {{what may be}} the earliest camel bones with signs of domestication found in Israel or even outside the Arabian peninsula, dating to around 930 BCE. This is seen <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> excavators that the stories of Abraham, Joseph, Jacob and Esau were written or rewritten after this time seeing that the Biblical books frequently reference traveling with caravans of domesticated camels.|$|R

5|$|Platform E6 is {{situated}} {{on the west side}} of the Group E plaza. It is roughly built from irregularly sized, poorly cut stones. The platform faces east towards Pyramid E1 and has four access stairways. The platform once supported perishable residences; these were built from maize stalks bound together with clay, <b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> imprint of the maize stalks in the fragments of clay wall recovered during excavations. The platform itself was once covered with stucco.|$|E
5|$|Takalik Abaj was reoccupied at the {{beginning}} of the Middle Preclassic. This was probably by Mixe–Zoquean inhabitants, <b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> plentiful Olmec-style sculpture at the site dating to this period. The construction of public architecture had probably begun by the Middle Preclassic; the earliest structures were made of clay, which was sometimes partially burned in order to harden it. Ceramics from this period belonged to the local Ocosito tradition. This ceramic tradition, although it was local, showed strong affinities with the ceramics of the coastal plain and foothills of the Escuintla region.|$|E
5|$|The Bahrain Petroleum Company (Bapco), a {{subsidiary}} of the Standard Oil Company of California (Socal), discovered oil in 1931 and production began the following year. This was to bring rapid modernisation to Bahrain. Relations with the United Kingdom became closer, <b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British Royal Navy moving its entire Middle Eastern command from Bushehr in Iran to Bahrain in 1935.|$|E
50|$|Executive Order 11246 {{signed into}} law in 1965, {{requires}} equal employment opportunity and prohibits discrimination. This law has been enforced for all except Asian Americans, <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> low glass ceiling still hanging over this ethnic minority. Prior to election 2008, {{in its effort to}} shatter this glass ceiling, 80-20 obtained written commitments from nine of the eleven Democratic Presidential candidates, including then Senator Barack Obama and Senator Joe Biden, to enforce EO 11246 for All Asian Americans.|$|R
50|$|The sun is {{the primary}} source of energy for living organisms. Some living organisms like plants need {{sunlight}} directly while other organisms like humans can acquire energy from the sun indirectly. There is however evidence that some bacteria can thrive in harsh environments like Antarctica <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> blue-green algae beneath thick layers of ice in the lakes. No matter what the type of living species, all living organisms must capture, transduce, store, and use energy to live.|$|R

5|$|The {{combined}} {{center of}} mass does move slightly to the left when the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, and the bike leans to the left in response. The action, in space, would have the tires move right, but this is prevented by friction between the tires and the ground, and thus pushes the combined {{center of mass}} left. This is a small effect, however, <b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> difficulty most people have in balancing a bike by this method alone.|$|E
5|$|Although Kwee was {{a staunch}} {{supporter}} of realism in literature, Drama dari Krakatau includes {{a degree of}} mysticism, <b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> apparent connection between the statue in the cave and the eruption of Krakatoa. Indeed, in many of his writings (both fiction and non-fiction), Kwee exhibited {{an interest in the}} occult; this includes writing detailed depictions of Therese Neumann, a fasting girl from Germany; and Omar Khayyám, a Persian Sufi mystic, philosopher and poet. The Indonesian literary critic Jakob Sumardjo finds the mystical elements (and the fact that no Hindu-era statues with inscriptions have been found) detract from the overall value of the novel.|$|E
5|$|As {{the city}} grew, the hotels {{reflected}} ambitions {{of the strong}} economy, <b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> eleven-story skyscraper Lamar Hotel built in 1927. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, the Lamar Hotel was adapted {{for use as a}} county annex building. In 1988 it was listed as a Mississippi Landmark. The E.F. Young Hotel was built in 1931. A staple in the African-American business district that developed west of the city's core, the hotel was one of the only places in the city during the years of segregation where a traveling African American could find a room.|$|E
