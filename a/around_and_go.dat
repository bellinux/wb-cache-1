500|$|In July, Dylan {{appeared}} at the second Newport Folk Festival. That weekend, Peter, Paul and Mary's rendition of [...] "Blowin' in the Wind" [...] reached number two on Billboards pop chart. Baez was also at Newport, appearing twice on stage with Dylan. The combination of the chart success of [...] "Blowin' in the Wind", and the glamor of Baez and Dylan singing together generated excitement about Dylan and his new album. Tom Paxton recalled: [...] "That was a big breakout festival for Bob. The buzz kept growing exponentially {{and it was like}} a coronation of Bob and Joan. They were King and Queen of the festival". His friend Bob Fass recalled that after Newport, Dylan told him that [...] "suddenly I just can't walk around without a disguise. I used to walk <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> wherever I wanted. But now it's gotten very weird. People follow me into the men's room just so they can say that they saw me pee." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to {{the legend}} of Ɓoxo-koƥ (dog of the forest or [...] "wild dog" [...] (figuritively) - jackal), the jackal was the first living thing created by the supreme deity Roog. The jackal circled {{the world in a}} day and two of its hands were {{transformed}} into paws. [...] The supreme being gave it the ngud tree (guiera senegalensis) and thus ngud became the first tree and the second thing created by Roog. After the creation of ngud, the nalafun tree (combretum paniculatum) was created to whom the deity told: [...] "Go and keep the ngud tree company, it is lonely". During the life cycle of the nalafun, the tree grow so tall that it headed towards the sky. The supreme being considered that an affront and gave it a sharp flick on the head (mak in Serer) and told it: [...] "You are rude. Go! Turn <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> back to where you've just came from". After that event, the nalafun never grew tall as it once did and was always bent.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, Anderson {{participated in}} the SBS doco-reality show Go Back To Where You Came From, in which six Australians, each with differing {{opinions}} on Australia's asylum seeker debate, were taken on a journey to which refugees have taken to reach Australia. At {{the outset of the}} series Anderson says that [...] "boat people" [...] who arrive in Australia illegally should be sent back to their countries of origin: [...] "If you come here illegally, I don't care about your story, first thing you do is you turn <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> back." [...] Later in the series, after having met with refugees from Afghanistan who settled in Melbourne as well as visiting war-torn Kabul, Anderson softened his stand on the subject: [...] "Now I've been here and spoken to people, I don't want to turn away refugees, I don't want to turn away people who need to be reunited with their families. I don't want that. Who would want that? [...] I don't want people to go on suffering needlessly, when we can give them somewhere safe to be. But I don't want them to come to Australia in boats." ...|$|E

6000|$|Then came a great cheer, and Mrs. Block--who, {{having been}} {{assured that the}} whale had entirely disappeared, had come on deck--turned {{to her husband and}} remarked: [...] "Now, Sammy, is there any earthly reason why we should not turn right <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> {{straight}} home?

60|$|The {{mountain}} {{side was}} so steep {{that the entire}} town had a slant to it like a roof. Each street was a terrace, and from each to the next street below the descent was forty or fifty feet. The fronts of the houses were level with the street they faced, but their rear first floors were propped on lofty stilts; a man could stand at a rear first floor window of a C street house and look down the chimneys of the row of houses below him facing D street. It was a laborious climb, in that thin atmosphere, to ascend from D to A street, and you were panting and out of breath when you got there; but you could turn <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> down again like a house a-fire--so to speak. The atmosphere was so rarified, {{on account of the}} great altitude, that one's blood lay near the surface always, and the scratch of a pin was a disaster worth worrying about, for the chances were that a grievous erysipelas would ensue. But to offset this, the thin atmosphere seemed to carry healing to gunshot wounds, and therefore, to simply shoot your adversary through both lungs was a thing not likely to afford you any permanent satisfaction, for he would be nearly certain to be around looking for you within the month, and not with an opera glass, either.|$|E

2500|$|At that time, {{he started}} for the Red river {{district}} of Minnesota, but the Indians were a source of constant menace {{at the time and}} the adventurous lad decided it would be best not to attempt to personally annihilate them, <b>and</b> accordingly turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> to the southern states in 1862.

6000|$|I did not {{immediately}} fix a date for my departure, for {{it was necessary for}} me to consider my grandmother's feelings and welfare, and arrange to make her as happy as possible while I should be gone. In the mean time, it was of course necessary that I should take air and exercise; and while doing this one morning in a pretty lane, just out of the village, a figure in the House of Martha gray came into sight a little distance ahead of me. Her back was toward me, and she was walking slower than I was. [...] "Now, then," [...] thought I, [...] "here is a proof of the awkwardness of my position here. Even in a little walk like this, I must run up against one of those sisters. I must pass her, or turn <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> back, for I shall not slow up, and appear to be dogging her footsteps. But I shall not turn back,--that does not suit me." [...] Consequently I walked on, and soon overtook the woman in gray. She did not turn her head as I approached, for the sisters are taught not to turn their heads to look at people. After all, it would be easy enough for me to adopt the same rule, and to pass her without turning my head, or paying the slightest attention to her. This was the manner indeed in which the general public was expected to act toward the inmates of the House of Martha when met outside their institution.|$|E

2500|$|The Wigwam in Ladysmith {{raised the}} price from 5 cents to 8 cents, a 62% price {{increase}}! Sixteen-year-old Parker Williams and his school chums were outraged.
