5|$|In 1928, Fairley {{received}} an appointment in London as Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and Lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Although he and Kellaway convinced the governors to delay Fairley's commencement until their major venom work was completed, he departed for London {{by the end}} of that year. He also opened a consulting practice in Harley Street. In London he encountered patients with filariasis and devised a test to diagnose the disease at an early stage; but when he went to write up his results he discovered that details of a similar test had already been published. In 1934, a sewer worker was referred to his ward with acute jaundice which Fairley diagnosed as caused by filariasis. The disease was revealed to be <b>an</b> <b>occupational</b> hazard of sewer workers, and steps were taken to protect the workers. Perhaps his most important work in this period was research into blackwater fever. Since malaria cases were uncommon in the United Kingdom, he made annual visits to the Malaria Research Laboratory of the League of Nations at the Refugee Hospital in Salonika. In the process, he described methaemalbumin, a previously unknown blood pigment. For his scientific accomplishments in London, Fairley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1942.|$|E

In a survey founded by World Health Organization’s regional office in Iran, the existing as well as gathered data from field were applied to propose <b>a</b> National <b>Occupational</b> Noise Exposure Limit. The collected data plus the existing data were processed to: propose <b>a</b> national <b>occupational</b> noise exposure limit and depict the major restrictions in application of existing field data in proposing <b>a</b> national <b>occupational</b> noise exposure limit. Results obtained from the present study shows that the occupational noise levels of 90 to 95 dBA can lead to hearing losses greater than 25 dBA. It was shown that occupational noise levels of 85 to 90 dBA would not lead to hearing losses greater than 20 dBA. The comparison of hearing losses shows that the noise levels of less than 80 dBA will not lead to any significant hearing loss. It was deduced that 85 dBA can be recommended for <b>a</b> national <b>occupational</b> noise limit in Iran.
