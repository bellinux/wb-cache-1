The album itself was recorded at Angelic Studios in Northampton during 2014. The liner notes suggest several other spaces were also used for parts of the album, including Crotch Int. in Gilsland, Eve Studios in Bredbury, Making Do in Manchester, and Distillery in Wiltshire.

Rocketeer creator Dave Stevens allied himself with director Joe Johnston and production manager Ian Bryce in <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as heavily involved in the production process as possible and to try and secure as much artistic control as he could from Disney.

The singer made <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> economical with his words, not communicating {{a lot of information}} with them. Rhys feels that the album is accessible to non-Welsh speakers, citing his own experience of listening to Nirvana: [...] "If I listen to a Nirvana record I don't understand most of their lyrics cos he's just screaming away, but I just understand the frustration and the passion in his voice. I think equally people can get off on this record by just hitting on the mood of the song, or connecting to the mood of the song." ...|$|E

500|$|Following season one, Parks and Recreation was {{originally}} renewed {{for a half}} season-worth of episodes, but was picked up for a full season in late October 2009. Greg Daniels said since the Parks and Recreation characters had now been established in the second season, the writers were able to write more specifically for the actors. Daniels said he believed this allowed the characters to become more balanced, rather than simply an accumulation of flaws, as they sometimes appeared in the first season. The writing staff also made <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more topical with the second-season episodes. For example, the episode [...] "Pawnee Zoo" [...] included social commentary about same-sex marriage. Likewise, [...] "The Stakeout" [...] included a parody of the arrest of Henry Louis Gates, a black Harvard University professor who was arrested after police mistakenly thought he was breaking into his own home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a sex scandal involving a Pawnee councilman in [...] "Practice Date" [...] mirrored the real-life 2009 scandal of South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford, who publicly admitted to a long-term extramarital affair with an Argentinian woman.|$|E
500|$|Simon Woodroffe {{explained}} that the character of Simon {{was a mixture of}} Blackadder, Rincewind, and Guybrush, and that he was originally intended to be a trainee wizard, similar to Harry Potter. He also {{explained that}} he was invented because they needed a character to compete with characters such as Rincewind, and that the game was inspired by the Discworld books and Monkey Island. Mike Woodroffe said that the game was inspired by Dungeons & Dragons magic stories. The character was invented during a journey on the M5 motorway, and was not named after Woodroffe. The name [...] "Simon the Sorcerer" [...] had that format because of the magical nature of the character, and because other names, such as [...] "Willy The Wizard", were rejected because they were disliked. Simon the Sorcerer was developed by a team of 15 people. There was <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> British so as to distinguish themselves from the humour of Monkey Island. Simon Woodroffe stated that his greatest challenges were the script creation and puzzle design, and he tuned the scripts continuously. The world was created for the characters rather than the puzzles, and the story was wrapped around characters the team liked. Woodroffe believed that AdventureSoft were able to rival more experienced studios due to their small team, all of whom ad the same goals and passion for the game.|$|E

[...] In <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> self-sufficient, the soldiers of the fort built roads, planted crops, and built a grist mill and a sawmill at Saint Anthony Falls. [...] Later, Franklin Steele came to Fort Snelling as the post sutler (the operator of the general store), and established interests in lumbering and other activities. [...] When the Ojibwe signed a treaty ceding lands in 1837, Steele staked a claim to land {{on the east side of}} the Mississippi River adjacent to Saint Anthony Falls. [...] In 1848, he built a sawmill at the falls, and the community of Saint Anthony sprung up around the east side of the falls. [...] Steele told one of his employees, John H. Stevens, that land on the west side of the falls would make a good site for future mills. [...] Since the land on the west side was still part of the military reservation, Stevens made a deal with Fort Snelling's commander. [...] Stevens would provide free ferry service across the river in exchange for a tract of [...] at the head of the falls. [...] Stevens received the claim and built a house, the first house in Minneapolis, in 1850. In 1854, Stevens platted the city of Minneapolis on the west bank.

2500|$|The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 {{provided}} for the land needed to build the transcontinental railroad. The land given the railroads alternated with government-owned tracts saved for free distribution to homesteaders. In <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> equitable, the federal government reduced each tract to [...] because of its perceived higher value given its proximity to the rail line. Railroads had {{up to five years}} to sell or mortgage their land, after tracks were laid, after which unsold land could be purchased by anyone. Often railroads sold some of their government acquired land to homesteaders immediately to encourage settlement and the growth of markets the railroads would then be able to serve. Nebraska railroads in the 1870s were strong boosters of lands along their routes. They sent agents to Germany and Scandinavia with package deals that included cheap transportation for the family as well as its furniture and farm tools, and they offered long-term credit at low rates. Boosterism succeeded in attracting adventurous American and European families to Nebraska, helping them purchase land grant parcels on good terms. The selling price depended on such factors as soil quality, water, and distance from the railroad.|$|E
2500|$|An {{estimated}} 12 {{million people}} fled or were {{expelled from the}} Soviet Union and non-German-speaking Central Europe, many of them being 'Volksdeutsche'. Most left the Soviet-occupied territories of Central and Eastern Europe; they comprised the largest migration of any European people in modern history. [...] The then three Allies had agreed to the expulsions during negotiations {{in the midst of}} war. The western powers hoped to avoid ethnic Germans being an issue again in Central and Eastern Europe. The three Allies at the Conference of Potsdam considered the [...] "transfer" [...] of [...] "German populations" [...] from Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> undertaken (see article 12 of the Potsdam Agreement), although they asked a halt because of the inflicted burden for the Allies to feed and house the destitute expellees and to share that burden among the Allies. France, which was not represented in Potsdam, rejected the decision of the Three of Potsdam and did not absorb expellees in its zone of occupation. The three Allies had to accept the reality on the ground, since expulsions of Volksdeutsche and Central and Eastern European nationals of German or alleged German ethnicity who never had enrolled as Volksdeutsche, was going on already.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the first}} season, the writing staff {{received}} audience feedback that Leslie Knope seemed unintelligent and [...] "ditzy". Schur said the writers {{did not intend}} for Leslie to be stupid, but rather an overeager woman who [...] "takes her job too seriously," [...] so a particular {{effort was made to}} present that character as more intelligent and capable at her job starting in the second season. The staff also decided to move on from the construction pit story arc, having the pit filled in the second-season episode [...] "Kaboom". Although it was originally conceived that the pit would only become a park in the series finale, Schur said the plotline was accelerated because early episodes were too focused on the pit and had led viewers to believe the entire show was about filling it in, which was not the writers' intention. Also starting with the second season, the writers made <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more topical and incorporate current events into their scripts. For example, the episode [...] "Pawnee Zoo" [...] included social commentary about same-sex marriage. [...] "The Stakeout" [...] included a parody of the controversial arrest of Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates, and a sex scandal involving a Pawnee councilman in [...] "Practice Date" [...] mirrored the real-life 2009 scandal of South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford.|$|E
2500|$|Draco Malfoy {{makes his}} first {{appearance}} in the series when he and Harry meet while being fitted for school robes at Madam Malkin's, a clothing shop in Diagon Alley. Not realising that {{the boy in the}} store is Harry Potter—a child whose parents were murdered when he was one year old by the powerful dark wizard Lord Voldemort—Draco engages him in (for him) polite conversation. Harry, however, is alienated by the arrogance of Draco, who asks whether the orphan's parents are [...] "our kind" [...] (pure-blood wizards). Draco then proclaims that [...] "the other sort" [...] (Muggle-borns) should not be allowed at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, because [...] "they've never been brought up to know our ways". The two boys part without introductions, but meet again on the Hogwarts Express. After Draco ridicules Ron Weasley's family, Harry rejects his offer of friendship, demonstrated by a handshake, and their mutual antagonism is born. According to Rowling, Malfoy originally makes <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Harry's friend because [...] "it will be cool to turn up at the school being Harry Potter's friend, because Harry is so famous." [...] However, Harry did not want Malfoy as a friend because he [...] "has been so rude about Rubeus Hagrid and about Ron, who Harry likes so much". At the first years' Sorting Ceremony, the Sorting Hat places him into Slytherin (barely touching Draco's head), the house that has developed all of the bad wizards, where he becomes an instant favourite of Potions teacher and Slytherin Head of House, Severus Snape, so-called follower of Lord Voldemort. Draco attempts to get Harry expelled by tricking him into participating in a midnight wizard's duel after secretly informing Argus Filch in advance, but the plan fails when Harry evades Filch and safely makes it back to his dormitory.|$|E
