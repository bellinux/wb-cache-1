5|$|In {{between the}} time Scott {{released}} Alien in 1979 {{and returned to the}} franchise with Prometheus in 2012, he directed another notable science fiction film concerning artificial intelligence, Blade Runner, in 1982. Contrary to the white-blooded androids of Alien that emulate emotions and recognize <b>a</b> <b>disconnect</b> with humanity, Blade Runner features the replicants- enhanced biorobotic humanoids that may only be identified by their lacking emotions. In order to maintain control, the replicants' human creators install false memories that detail entire lives that give them a sense of identity. Blade Runner, a largely influential film, has prompted a slew of philosophical questions concerning artificial intelligence and whether or not an android could truly be considered alive. The film specifically questions whether thoughts, a sense of identity, emotions and consciousness in general, may be something genuine when applied to artificial intelligence. Due to David identifying himself as a living entity - similar to the replicants - film critics in 2012 would come not to only question if Prometheus was a direct prequel to Alien, but if the film had a relation to Blade Runner.|$|E
5|$|The first {{installment}} of the story-based DLC The Knife of Dunwall was praised for its level design, which encouraged exploration to find hidden content and alternative routes through areas. The modifications to certain abilities, particularly Blink were similarly well received for the changes they brought to the gameplay from the main game. The story, however, was generally criticized. Polygon noted that the deadly assassin Daud had no motive for seeking redemption, and allowing him to be played as a non-lethal character created <b>a</b> <b>disconnect</b> with the narrative. IGN considered that it felt like only half of a complete game, lacking any urgency in its story and featuring a disappointing conclusion. The Brigmore Witches story received a mixed response, with Destructoid saying that it offered a more gripping narrative, while Polygon stated that it lacked the same tension as The Knife of Dunwall, and the ending felt rushed and unsatisfying. However, the gameplay was generally considered an improvement, providing more intricate level design and nuanced world building that produced gameplay requiring a more thoughtful approach. PC Gamer appreciated that the levels each had a distinct theme, and adequately provided for both stealth and violent gameplay, while Polygon said that only the last level improved over the preceding DLC, introducing new mechanics that forced changes in stealth players.|$|E

25|$|Even though humans derive many {{benefits}} from nature, our modern lifestyles have created <b>a</b> <b>disconnect</b> {{from the natural}} environment wherein we spend significantly more time indoors. Some researchers estimate that humans spend up to 90% of their lives indoors. This disconnection from nature can {{have a negative impact}} on humans because we are missing out on the beneficial effects of nature. As a result, we are less connected to nature and feel less responsibility to protect this environment.|$|E

Though the meat industry was growing substantially, many working class Britons had mostly vegetarian diets out of necessity rather than out of the desire to improve their health and morals. The working and middle classes did not have the luxury being able to choose what they would eat and they believed that a mixed diet was a valuable source of energy.|$|E
25|$|Losses at Truk were severe. Some 17,000 tons of stored fuel were {{destroyed}} by the strikes. Shipping losses totaled almost 200,000 tons including precious resources in fleet oilers. This represents almost one tenth of total Japanese shipping losses between 1 November 1943 and 30 June 1944. Moreover, the isolation of this whole area of operations by submarine and air attack meant the effective severance of Japanese shipping lanes between empire waters and critical fuel supplies in e.g. Borneo. The ultimate effect of such <b>a</b> <b>disconnect</b> was later seen during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, when IJN forces had to sortie separately from Japan and Lingga Roads due to fuel constraints.|$|E
25|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union, Warsaw Pact and Comecon there came <b>a</b> <b>disconnect</b> between end users, export companies, OKBs, assembly plants and component manufacturers (some of which now resided in newly independent and sometimes hostile nations). Russia also found that entire segments of its aviation requirements now lay in these foreign countries, for example the manufacture of jet training aircraft had been assigned to Czechoslovakia, while Poland got light helicopters and crop-dusting airplanes, Romania did also manufacture light helicopters, the majority of its tactical airlifter design capability {{in the form of the}} Antonov OKB was now in Ukraine, and the main assembly plant for the Sukhoi Su-25 ground attack aircraft was in Georgia.|$|E

25|$|While herbicide-use {{has been}} {{proposed}} as one factor causing the decline in overwintering numbers of eastern monarchs, {{it is not the}} only possibility. Another is that the monarchs are experiencing problems reaching Mexico. This idea has been embraced by a number of leading monarch researchers, largely because of recent evidence showing that the number of breeding (adult) monarchs has not declined in the last two decades, based on long-term citizen science data. The lack of long-term declines in the numbers of breeding, and migratory monarchs, yet the clear declines in overwintering numbers, implies there is <b>a</b> <b>disconnect</b> between these life stages, that must be growing. One expert has proposed that a large and growing threat to migrating monarchs is mortality from car strikes.|$|E
25|$|The 2006 season {{brought the}} A's {{back to the}} postseason after a three-year absence. After {{finishing}} the season at 93–69, four games ahead of the Angels, the A's were considered the underdog against the highly favored Minnesota Twins. The A's swept the series 3–0 however, despite having to start {{on the road and}} losing second baseman Mark Ellis, who sustained a broken finger after getting hit by a pitch in the second game. Their victory was short-lived though, as the A's were swept 4–0 by the Detroit Tigers. Manager Ken Macha was fired by Billy Beane on October 16, four days after their loss in the 2006 American League Championship Series. Beane cited <b>a</b> <b>disconnect</b> between him and his players as well as a general unhappiness among the team as the reason for his sudden departure.|$|E

Kan acknowledged the slow pace of government response to the disaster on March 3, 2011, and pledged to speed up recovery efforts. Residents displaced by the tsunami have opposed Agency-led plans to rebuild towns on higher land away from the coast, and see it as <b>a</b> <b>disconnect</b> between the central government and the population in the Tōhoku region.

500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "C" [...] grade. While {{he enjoyed the}} main storyline {{revolving}} around Michael and Toby and felt that it [...] "came together both comically and dramatically {{at the end of}} the day", he felt the rest of the episode was [...] "quite uneven" [...] with elements that were [...] "ridiculous", such as how Pam attained her new job. McNutt's largest complaint with the remainder of the episode was that neither ended in [...] "a logical place"; he felt Dwight's plot featured <b>a</b> <b>disconnect</b> from the character, and that Pam's story was [...] "lazy".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the heavy}} tone, humor is prominent. [...] The work is {{conscious}} {{of its own}} creation—Green's drawing of it frames the narrative proper and there are constant reminders of it throughout. [...] Green patterned the opening after those featuring the Crypt-Keeper in EC Comics' Tales from the Crypt series from the 1950s. [...] Green used the adult Binky as the narrator of the captions and {{as a way to}} tie together the past and present timeframes. There is <b>a</b> <b>disconnect</b> in that the narrator refers to his younger self as [...] "he". [...] Other references to comics include a Sinstopper's Guidebook, which alludes to Dick Tracy's Crimestopper's Textbook and a cartoon by Robert Crumb in the background.|$|E

Later in the song she expresses the pain she feels having wasted so much time into her relationship, and decides to leave her dysfunctional lover: [...] "You've got a hold on me / You're like a wasted dream / I gave you everything / But you don't know how to love me when you're sober".|$|E

500|$|Feynman devoted {{the latter}} half of his book What Do You Care What Other People Think? to his {{experience}} on the Rogers Commission, straying from his usual convention of brief, light-hearted anecdotes to deliver an extended and sober narrative. Feynman's account reveals <b>a</b> <b>disconnect</b> between NASA's engineers and executives that was far more striking than he expected. His interviews of NASA's high-ranking managers revealed startling misunderstandings of elementary concepts. For instance, NASA managers claimed that there was a 1 in 100,000 chance of a catastrophic failure aboard the shuttle, but Feynman discovered that NASA's own engineers estimated the chance of a catastrophe at closer to 1 in 200. He concluded that NASA management's estimate of the reliability of the space shuttle was unrealistic, and he was particularly angered that NASA used it to recruit Christa McAuliffe into the Teacher-in-Space program. He warned in his appendix to the commission's report (which was included only after he threatened not to sign the report), [...] "For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled." ...|$|E
500|$|After the episode's broadcast, Popular Mechanics {{published}} an article analyzing the science depicted. They concluded that the Brain–computer interface (BCI) chips, like the ones used in the episode to tie the victims' brains to the computer used by Dr. Laxmeesh Nayak, have also been used on real-life human subjects, though not in relation to controlling sleep cycles. However, the article continued that it is [...] "not currently possible" [...] for BCI chips to [...] "facilitate direct transfer of understandable information from one person's brain to another", nor {{is it possible for}} the chips to [...] "directly read another person's thoughts or dreams" [...] and steal them. In addition, Popular Mechanics noted that Walter's theory of the victims' deaths being caused by exhaustion is [...] "pure bunk", as there are many long-term experiments that have safely tested humans' deprivation of REM sleep. According to one scientist interviewed, though chips shown in [...] "Dream Logic" [...] cause hallucinations, paranoid thoughts, and <b>a</b> <b>disconnect</b> from reality, these traits are [...] "not even remotely possible" [...] outside of fiction.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Robert Florence {{praised the}} app for calculating {{variables}} like movement range and tracking statistics like health and ability cooldowns, but spoke of <b>a</b> <b>disconnect</b> caused by constantly shifting focus between {{the screen and}} the board. While ultimately questioning {{the need for the}} physical components at all, Florence also saw the game as having potential in the future. Chris Hutton of Tom's Guide took a much more negative view. Hutton found it cumbersome that the starter kit came with only one stylus and that only one device running the app could be synced to a given game at a time, necessitating that the screen and stylus be passed back and forth between players. He also found the stylus itself to be unresponsive, slowing the game down to the point that he lost interest. VentureBeats Jay Henningsen, on the other hand, had nothing but praise for the app and stylus. After fifteen minutes he found using the stylus to be [...] "almost natural", and found that the app handling all of the rules and stat-keeping made for [...] "one of the easiest experiences I’ve ever had getting into a new game". He {{went on to say that}} players will look to see the technology spread to other miniature wargaming products.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The toric Hilbert {{scheme is}} a {{parameter}} space for all ideals {{with the same}} multi-graded Hilbert function as a given toric ideal. Unlike the classical Hilbert scheme, it is unknown whether toric Hilbert schemes are connected. We construct a graph on all the monomial ideals on the scheme, called the flip graph, and prove that the toric Hilbert scheme is connected {{if and only if}} the flip graph is connected. These graphs are used to exhibit curves in P 4 whose associated toric Hilbert schemes have arbitrary dimension. We show that the flip graph maps into the Baues graph of all triangulations of the point configuration defining the toric ideal. Inspired by the recent discovery of <b>a</b> <b>disconnected</b> Baues graph, we close with results that suggest the existence of <b>a</b> <b>disconnected</b> flip graph and hence <b>a</b> <b>disconnected</b> toric Hilbert scheme. 1...|$|R
