40|$|Since 1992, New Zealand {{has engaged}} in a sector-neutral {{approach}} to accounting standard setting – where a transaction is accounted for based on its underlying economic nature {{rather than on the}} type of entity undertaking it. Underpinned by the premise that GAAP can be generalised across the public/private divide, we examine whether systematic differences exist between accounting policies adopted by reporting entities with different ownership and/or operating objectives. We find evidence of sector preference in the choice of useful life for comparable depreciable assets, and differences in policies for the <b>amortisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>goodwill.</b> We also find evidence of sector convergence in the choice of methods for accounting for valuation of non-current assets, deferred taxation and inventory. It is observed that the two accounting policies indicating sector preference have a more direct impact on the Statement of Financial Performance than the other policies examined...|$|E
40|$|UK {{accounting}} practice differs from International Accounting Standards (IASs) {{particularly with regard}} to <b>amortisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>goodwill,</b> provision for deferred taxation and the accounting treatment of pension costs. Under the core standards programme of the IASC the IASs have emerged closer to US practice. This paper evaluates the profit of those UK companies reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 1988 and 1994, spanning a period which saw the establishment of the ASB and the implementation of the IASC's comparability project. An increasing gap was found between the reported profit under UK accounting principles and that restated under US GAAP. The difference lay most frequently in accounting for goodwill, provision for deferred tax, and the accounting treatment of pension costs, with accounting for goodwill showing a particularly significant impact in 1994. Notwithstanding the introduction of FRS 10, an overall impression of increasing disharmony could continue to cause reconciliations to be required of UK companies seeking full listing on a US stock exchange, with consequent disadvantage relative to companies in other European countries seeking international capital in the US...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} preparers’ and non-preparers’ {{positions}} regarding accounting for goodwill are examined through studying submitted comment letters on ED 3 ‘Business Combinations’. Preparers have, because of economic consequences, incentives {{to lobby for}} the non-amortisation approach and non-preparers for the amortisation approach. As hypothesised, non-preparers are found to support <b>amortisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> {{to a greater extent}} than do preparers. Moreover, the two groups’ supportive arguments, i. e. how they argue for or against the non-amortisation or amortisation approach, are studied. Again, as hypothesised, the results show that the two groups use the same type of ‘sophisticated’ framework based arguments instead of economic consequences arguments. Taken together the examination of the comment letters thus indicates that both preparers and non-preparers point at conceptual strengths and weaknesses, instead of pointing at the real cause of the lobbying activities, i. e. perceived economic consequences, when they try to affect the final outcome of the standard. These findings confirm earlier research which has suggested that self-interested lobbyists use accounting theories and concepts as useful justifications...|$|E

Based on two qualitative characteristics of accounting information, as formulated by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), {{the effects of the}} new impairment method are examined using a value relevance and a timeliness model. The sample consists of European companies that adopted this new method <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> accounting, following the required adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in 2005. The results indicate that impairment <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> is actually less value relevant than amortisation, but that it does lead to more timely accounting information. It is concluded that the objective of the IASB in issuing a new accounting standard is not completely met and it only partially contributes to higher accounting quality...|$|R

40|$|Banks’ {{valuation}} <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> {{has been}} questioned by analysts and the media. Analysts suggest that bank management as of {{the inception of the}} financial crisis have exploited the unverifiable fair value goodwill accounting opportunistically. This suggestion implicitly implies that bank management was more likely than management of other industries to exploit goodwill accounting during the financial turmoil. In this thesis, I test whether the value relevance of banks’ valuation <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> was affected differently than other industries during the financial turmoil. To do so, I use the value relevance of the pharmaceutical industry’s valuation <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> as a control group for banks. Further, I hypothesize that (1) banks’ valuation <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> was value irrelevant since investors should have impounded the information of the analysts in the stock price; (2) pharmaceutical industry’s valuation <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> was value relevant since the financial turmoil did not severely affect its core business. The empirical result of the study suggests that the <b>goodwill</b> valuation <b>of</b> both banks and pharmaceuticals was value relevant. Moreover, the empirical result indicates that banks’ valuation <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> was not less value relevant than the pharmaceuticals’ valuation <b>of</b> <b>goodwill.</b> In summary, banks’ valuation <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> seems to have been value relevant during the financial turmoil.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the value relevance of goodwill {{that has been}} eliminated through reserves {{in the year of}} acquisition. Specifically, it investigates the association beiween goodwill reserve write-off and the value placed on the firm by the stock market. In so doing, the thesis describes the relationship between the implied value of purchased goodwill and that of other assets, and we seek to explain the underlying paffern of the <b>amortisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> over time. The empirical method uses cross-sectional equity valuation models for the period 1994 - 6. Based on the modified balance sheet identity, the equity valuation model parameterises purchased goodwill and other assets separately, and a more meaningful interpretation is given of the intercept term than in previous studies relating to purchased goodwill. The results confirm that the market incorporates information on the goodwill reserve write-off in the valuation of a firm, and the results also show that the market: book ratio is similar to tangible assets but its behaviour suggests a relatively higher amortisation rate. Although the present study provides evidence supporting the requirement in FRS 10 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) to capitalise purchased goodwill, the findings also show that the incremental value of capitalised goodwill declines far more quickly than FRS 1 O suggests, thus placing particular importance on the impairment test required by FRS 10...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} {{to an understanding}} of capital budgeting and accounting practice. The factors affecting practice are of special research interest. It is also investigated whether practice diverges from what is prescribed by finance text books and accounting standards/frameworks. The overarching research question posed in this thesis is: “What capital budgeting and accounting choices are made by top management in practice, and how can these choices be explained?”. The thesis consists of four papers that address this issue. The first two papers focused on capital budgeting choices. Findings emphasised that the use of sophisticated capital budgeting and cost of capital estimation methods such as NPV and CAPM was widespread in Swedish listed companies. However, also unsophisticated accounting based methods were employed. Overall, findings suggested that Swedish companies used capital budgeting and cost of capital estimation techniques less often than did U. S. /continental European companies. Other interesting findings were changes over time. Over time, the use of sophisticated methods increased and the use of unsophisticated methods decreased. This indicated a closing of the theory-practice gap. Finally, size was generally positively related to more extensive use of methods. The last two papers focused on accounting choices. Findings showed that non-preparers supported <b>amortisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> {{to a greater extent than}} did preparers. Preparers instead supported the goodwill impairment-only approach. It was suggested that economic consequences could explain why preparers supported the goodwill impairment-only approach. When the impairment-only approach subsequently was introduced by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), Swedish and Dutch preparers however only disclosed slightly more than 60 % of the assumptions underlying the impairment test, after three years of learning. Moreover, findings showed that the level of compliance with the IASB’s disclosure requirements was associated with industry; financials were less compliant than were non-financials. Findings also showed that Swedish and Dutch companies were more compliant in 2008 than they were in 2005, which suggested learning over time. Finally, in 2005 the disclosure compliance level was higher in Sweden than in the Netherlands. Three years later, 2008, the difference was eliminated, thus indicating convergence...|$|E
40|$|M. Com. (Accounting) This study {{sets out}} to suggest a method of {{accounting}} for goodwill and brands which is practically feasible, yet conceptually justifiable. Only positive, acquired goodwill is relevant {{for purposes of this}} study. Both acquired and internally generated brands are, however, investigated. In terms of historical cost accounting, both acquired goodwill and brands qualify as assets of the enterprise since they are controlled by the enterprise as a result of past transactions and future economic benefits are expected to flow therefrom. Goodwill arises as a balancing amount in terms of double entry accounting {{as a result of the}} fact that the purchase consideration applicable to a business take-over often exceeds the aggregate of the fair values of the acquired enterprise's net assets. Because goodwill can therefore effectively be seen as a function of two other figures, the potential exists that it can be manipulated. A number of possible alternative accounting treatments of goodwill are in existence. In spite of a historical background of divergence, international statements now display increasing agreement in favour of the amortisation option. The opposite is, however, true in respect of the financial statements of South African companies. The. preparers and users of financial interest in preventing goodwill as statements have a vested far as possible. As regards goodwill that does arise, an accounting treatment with the smallest possible detrimental effect on the financial position and results of the company will enjoy preference. Contrary to this is the fact that the <b>amortisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> is the most justifiable alternative from a conceptual point of view. A number of accounting options have been developed over the years with the intention of either preventing goodwill, or at least limiting its extent. Included in this is merger accounting (also called pooling of interests accounting) in terms of which goodwill is effectively set off against the share premium account in the case of a take-over where the purchase consideration is settled by means of a share issue. Another method is the capitalisation of brands in the place of goodwill. Brands are therefore considered to be a mere substitute for goodwill on the balance sheet and is consequently of doubtful value from an accounting and financial analysis point of view. In spite of a variety of accounting alternatives, acquired brands should thus be accounted for in the same way as goodwill. Furthermore, internally generated brands should not be acknowledged on the balance sheet. The implementation of this will lead to the artificial distinction between goodwill and brands losing its prominence in the course of tim...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the topic <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> {{and the possibility}} of achieving a synthesis between its legal and accounting concepts. The genesis for this topic was the assertion by the High Court in FCT v. Murry that the legal and accounting concepts <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> were different to the extent that a synthesis between the concepts could not be achieved. The approach taken involves an examination of the evolution, nature and treatment <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> in both the legal and accounting contexts. The major focus is on the legal concept, but significant attention is also given to the accounting concept to enable an examination of the possibility of a synthesis between the two. Thus chapters 2 - 12 deal largely with the legal concept <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> and chapters 13 - 14 deal with the accounting concept. Chapter 15 contains the final analysis and conclusions. Chapter 1 introduces the topic and addresses a range <b>of</b> definitions <b>of</b> <b>goodwill,</b> both legal and accounting definitions. Chapter 2 examines the evolution <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> as a commercial legal concept dating back to early references in the sixteenth century. Chapter 3 carries on the examination of the legal concept {{from the point of view}} of it major elements and sources. Chapter 4 deals with important issues which go to the heart of our understanding <b>of</b> legal <b>goodwill.</b> The essential issues concern the concept <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> as one whole item of property, inseparably attached to a business but separate from its sources. Chapters 5 - 12 examine the concept in a range of specific legal contexts in order to determine what they add to our understanding and also to determine how the essential nature <b>of</b> legal <b>goodwill</b> holds up in these various contexts. Chapter 5 deals with goodwill in the context of partnerships. Much of the case law involving goodwill in this context arose in the nineteenth century in relation to the termination of partnerships. Chapter 6 examines goodwill in relation to restrictive covenants designed to protect the <b>goodwill</b> <b>of</b> a business. The history of the law of restrictive covenants can be traced back to the fifteenth century, where an incipient notion <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> may be seen to be emerging. Chapter 7 examines goodwill in the context of stamp duties, a tax with a long pedigree stretching back to the late seventeenth century. Chapter 8 examines the authorities concerning the nature and treatment <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> in the contexts of licensing, leasing and franchising. In chapter 9 the legal concept <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> is examined in the broad-ranging context of the tort <b>of</b> passing-off. <b>Goodwill</b> plays a central part in the modern tort as the element of business to be protected from damage by the act of passing-off. As discussed in chapter 10, the field of compensation law presents certain treatments <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> which strictly run counter to its legal nature, particularly in respect <b>of</b> counting <b>goodwill</b> as part <b>of</b> land in calculating an amount of compensation. However, as explained in this chapter, this is no more than a deeming device for the specific purposes of calculating compensation and thus should not be taken to deviate from the normal concept <b>of</b> <b>goodwill.</b> Chapter 11 deals with goodwill in a number of tax contexts not covered elsewhere in this paper. The relationship between tax and goodwill has been an uneasy one with a degree of friction between the concept <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> and its tax treatment. The last of the chapters focussing on legal goodwill, chapter 12, addresses issues concerning valuation in the legal context. Chapters 13 and 14 deal with the accounting concept <b>of</b> <b>goodwill.</b> Chapter 13 examines the origin and development <b>of</b> <b>goodwill.</b> It plots the evolution <b>of</b> accounting <b>goodwill</b> from its recognizable beginnings in the 1880 s to WWII. Chapter 14 carries on with the examination <b>of</b> accounting <b>goodwill</b> in the modern period, identified as the period after WWII with an emphasis on the time from the early 1980 s. As noted in the conclusion to that chapter, the definition, valuation and treatment <b>of</b> accounting <b>goodwill</b> have changed little in substance from the earlier periods pre-WWII. The conclusion in chapter 15 is that goodwill is essentially the same concept in both law and accounting, but a compound concept comprising different facets which apply in different contexts. Therefore, the need strictly to determine a synthesis is rendered redundant by this concept <b>of</b> <b>goodwill...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} the Australian {{approach to}} taxation <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> and related intangibles. It asks the questions: 'Is the current Australian approach to taxation <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> coherent?'; and 'Could {{a different approach}} minimise any distortions?' The thesis identifies the increasing importance <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> and other intangible property in a modern information-based economy. It identifies benchmarks for a 'good' tax system  such as efficiency, simplicity, and equity. It emphasises the criteria of simplicity and efficiency but includes other criteria and specifically considers the issue of alignment of accounting and legal concepts. It concludes that the current misalignment {{makes it difficult for}} the tax system to deal with goodwill coherently. The thesis criticises the treatment <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> under various Australian taxes, including stamp duty; Goods and Services Tax; taxation of capital gains; and income tax. It specifically considers the treatment of intangible sources <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> and their relationship with goodwill itself. The discussion of income tax pays particular attention to the role <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> and other intangibles in international transfer pricing. The thesis draws conclusions about the treatment <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> in Australia and whether the Australian approach meets the benchmarks established at the outset. The thesis demonstrates that the current Australian approach leads, inter alia, to tax avoidance. The current approach also offends a number of other criteria of a 'good' system. The thesis considers the UK tax treatment of intangibles held by resident companies and considers this model for Australia. It also considers the abandoned 'Tax Value Method' previously proposed for Australia. From this and other material, it suggests possible new directions and an alternative approach to taxing goodwill in Australia. These include a consistent and coherent definition <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> for tax that is compatible with law and accounting. The thesis also urges the development of a consistent approach to taxing goodwill at both the state and federal levels; and suggests greater reliance on the existence <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> as a means to establish jurisdiction to impose tax in international tax situations...|$|R

40|$|In 2005 a new {{recommendation}} was implemented, IAS 36 "Impairment of intangible assets". The Swedish {{translation of}} the recommendation is RR 17. The previous treatment <b>of</b> impairment <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> was to amortize it over {{a certain amount of}} years. In order for a company to make impairment, they had to estimate the decrease in value <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> to be permanent. The new recommendation RR 17 on the other hand states that goodwill should be impaired as soon as an indication of impairment loss is revealed. This implies that the new recommendation shows the fair value <b>of</b> <b>goodwill.</b> Our problem description is; how does the impairment procedure <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> in companies applying RR 17 look like? In order to reach the purpose of this study, which is to understand the impairment procedure <b>of</b> <b>goodwill,</b> we used four sub questions; (1) How does goodwill arise? (2) How is goodwill divided between cash generating units? (3) How do stock listed business combinations in accordance with RR 17 estimate whether an impairment loss <b>of</b> <b>goodwill</b> exist or not, in cases where goodwill exist, how is it impaired? (4) How is goodwill revalued and how often? The study has mainly taken a hermeneutic approach because we strive to understand the impairment procedure <b>of</b> <b>goodwill.</b> We conducted a qualitative study, with semi- structured interviews. Four companies, which operate in somewhat different branches, were chosen {{in order to get a}} diversified illustration of different business areas and see if there were any differences between them.

However we could identify some differences between the companies, which we believe are due to the fact that the companies operate in different business areas and are therefore faced with somewhat diverse risks. Further we could link the differences to be correlated to the mindsets and demands of the companies’ auditors. Finally we want to make the reader aware of the fact that the recommendation RR 17 has so far only been applied in an economic boom and therefore when we conducted this study the need to impair goodwill was very small. ...|$|R
