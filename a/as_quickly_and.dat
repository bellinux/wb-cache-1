5|$|While rejecting Danish authority, Olaf made it {{his mission}} to convert Norway and the Norse colonies in the west <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> as {{completely}} as possible. Proceeding with threats, torture and executions, Olaf broke down pagan resistance {{and within a few}} years Norway was, at least nominally, a Christian country. But King Olaf had acquired several enemies during his meteoric rise to power. The most prominent were Eirik Jarl, son of Haakon Jarl, and Svein Forkbeard, king of Denmark, both of whom felt that Olaf had deprived them of their share of Norway.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} {{noted that}} Great Lakes cargo vessels could normally avoid severe storms, {{and called for}} the establishment of a limiting sea state applicable to Great Lakes bulk cargo vessels. This would restrict the operation of vessels in sea states above the limiting value. One concern was that shipping companies pressured the captains to deliver cargo <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> cheaply as possible regardless of bad weather. At the time of Fitzgeralds foundering, there was no evidence that any governmental regulatory agency tried to control vessel movement in foul weather despite the historical record that hundreds of Great Lakes vessels had been wrecked in storms. The USCG took the position that only the captain could decide when it was safe to sail.|$|E

25|$|Air Tanzania {{recorded}} a pre-tax loss of almost USD 7.3million {{in its first}} year following privatisation. The loss was attributed mainly to the inability to expand the network <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> extensively as originally planned. It had been hoped to launch services to Dubai, India, and Europe, but these were delayed as Air Tanzania had only Boeing 737-200s in its fleet. The development of Dar es Salaam as an East African hub for the SAA alliance had also not proceeded as quickly as planned.|$|E
25|$|Several of Ayckbourn's {{observations}} about celebrity culture have obvious influences in the play. One notable quote was his opinion that a dangerous mistake celebrities can make is to believe {{all the good}} things said about them, both in publicity and what other people (particularly agents) say. He also suggested that in an age of increasing anonymity, some are increasingly desperate to be noticed. The play also follows the theory that when one quickly rises to the top, one can fall just <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> mercilessly.|$|E

A revival of Falstaff in honour of Verdi’s memory featured her <b>as</b> <b>Quickly</b> <b>and</b> she portrayed Fée Grignotte (the witch) in Hänsel und Gretel.

25|$|La Samaritaine, a {{department}} store, {{was founded by}} Ernest Cognacq in 1870 when he leased {{a small part of}} a building for commercial use. He then bought the building, and in stages bought the building that faces it on the rue de la Monnaie. In 1885 he engaged Jourdain to redesign the original building, {{and at the same time}} began to improve the exterior of the building. In 1904 Cognacq decided to expand the store. Jourdain was given the job of creating the maximum amount of space <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> cheaply as possible, and designed a radical steel structure. The flamboyant exterior decoration was executed by his son, the decorator Francis Jourdain, the painter Eugène Grasset, the metalworker Edouard Schenck and the ceramist Alexandre Bigot.|$|E
25|$|In March 1810 Jones {{was ordered}} to embark for Lisbon, where he was {{employed}} under Colonel (afterwards Sir) Richard Fletcher on the lines of Torres Vedras. In June Fletcher joined {{the headquarters of the}} army at Celerico, and Jones was appointed commanding engineer in the south of Portugal, and entrusted with the completion of the works to cover Lisbon from the threatened invasion of the French under Massena. The memoranda by Jones relative to these defences (printed for private circulation) form a most valuable military work, fully describing the various field-works forming the lines of Torres Vedras. All the arrangements for manning the works and placing the troops had been so well made by Jones that the several points were occupied <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> with as much regularity as if the troops had been re-entering their cantonments from a review.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{sensitive}} {{ecology of the}} Baltic Sea, it has been agreed in the Helsinki Convention (HELCOM) that instead of using dispersants to dissolve the oil slicks, combatting the spills is based on mechanical recovery using oil booms to limit the spill and skimmers to collect the oil from the surface <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> completely as possible. For this purpose every Finnish pollution control vessel is equipped with permanently installed built-in recovery equipment and such systems have also been installed on several patrol vessels of the Finnish Border Guard. As the primary mission of the new vessel is pollution prevention, the ship has an extensive array of equipment capable of detecting and recovering spilled oil and chemicals in open water, high seas and ice conditions. Some of the equipment, such as an oil-detecting radar and a thermographic camera in the mast, are used {{for the first time}} in a Finnish oil recovery vessel. In addition the ship has a weather station and a wet laboratory capable of analyzing water samples automatically.|$|E
25|$|There are {{records of}} drive hunts in the Faroe Islands dating from 1584. Whaling in the Faroe Islands is {{regulated}} by Faroese authorities {{but not by}} the International Whaling Commission as there are disagreements about the Commission's legal authority to regulate cetacean hunts. Hundreds of long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melaena) could be killed in a year, mainly during the summer. The hunts, called grindadráp in Faroese, are non-commercial and are organized on a community level; anyone can participate. When a whale pod by chance is spotted near land the participating hunters first surround the pilot whales with a wide semicircle of boats and then slowly and quietly begin to drive the whales towards the chosen authorised bay. When a pod of whales has been stranded the killing is begun. Faroese animal welfare legislation, which also applies to whaling, requires that animals are killed <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> with as little suffering as possible. A regulation spinal lance is used to sever the spinal cord, which also severs the major blood supply to the brain, ensuring both loss of consciousness and death within seconds. The spinal lance has been introduced as preferred standard equipment for killing pilot whales and {{has been shown to}} reduce killing time to 1–2 seconds.|$|E
25|$|In 1920 French Equatorial Africa was {{established}} and Ubangi-Shari was administered from Brazzaville. Modeled on King Leopold's Congo Free State, concessions were doled out to private companies that endeavored {{to strip the}} region’s assets <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> cheaply as possible before depositing a percentage of their profits into the French treasury. The concessionary companies forced local people to harvest rubber, coffee, and other commodities without pay and held their families hostage until they met their quotas. Between 1890, {{a year after the}} French first arrived, and 1940, about half of the population died as a result. During the 1920s and 1930s the French introduced a policy of mandatory cotton cultivation, a network of roads was built, attempts were made to combat sleeping sickness and Protestant missions were established to spread Christianity. New forms of forced labor were also introduced and a large number of Ubangians were sent to work on the Congo-Ocean Railway. Many of these forced laborers died of exhaustion, illness, or the poor conditions which claimed between 20% and 25% of the 127,000 workers. In 1928, a major insurrection, the Kongo-Wara rebellion or 'war of the hoe handle', broke out in Western Ubangi-Shari and continued for several years. The extent of this insurrection, which was perhaps the largest anti-colonial rebellion in Africa during the interwar years, was carefully hidden from the French public because it provided evidence of strong opposition to French colonial rule and forced labor.|$|E

500|$|For Apt Pupil, Bryan Singer filmed {{a shower}} {{scene in which}} Todd Bowden, {{saturated}} with horrific stories from Kurt Dussander, imagines his fellow showering students as Jewish prisoners in gas chambers. The scene was filmed at Eliot Middle School in Altadena, California on April2, 1997, and two weeks later, a 14-year-old extra filed a lawsuit alleging that Singer forced him and other extras to strip naked for the scene. Two boys, 16 and 17 years old, later supported the 14-year-old's claim. [...] The boys claimed trauma from the experience, seeking charges against the filmmakers including infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and invasion of privacy. Allegations were made that the boys were filmed for sexual gratification. The local news shows and national tabloid programs stirred the controversy. [...] A sexual crimes task force that included local, state, and federal personnel investigated the incident. The Los Angeles District Attorney's office determined {{that there was no}} cause to file criminal charges, stating, [...] "The suspects were intent on completing a professional film <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> efficiently as possible. There is no indication of lewd or abnormal sexual intent." [...] The civil case was dismissed due to insufficient evidence. The scene was filmed again with adult actors so the film could finish on time.|$|E

[...] Goldonikov noted that German pilots appreciated the Fw 190 radial engine as a shield, and frequently made head-on attacks in air-to-air combat. [...] "The plane", noted Golodnikov, [...] "had extremely powerful weapons: four 20mm guns and two machine guns. Soon, however, the Germans started evading frontal attack against our [...] "Cobras". We had a 37mm gun, so no engine would save you, and one hit was enough to kill you." ...|$|E
