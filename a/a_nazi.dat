5|$|Christopher Walken as Max Zorin: a psychopathic industrialist, {{the product}} of <b>a</b> <b>Nazi</b> genetic experiment, {{planning}} to destroy the Silicon Valley to gain a monopoly in the microchip market.|$|E
5|$|Many of Model's fellow {{officers}} considered him <b>a</b> <b>Nazi.</b> He frequently harangued his troops {{to have faith}} in the Führer and uphold the virtues of National Socialism. He accepted the offer of SS-Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein to appoint a Waffen-SS officer as his adjutant at Army Group North in 1944, after the Heerespersonalamt had refused him an adjutant, and filled the Nationalsozialistischer Führungsoffizier (NSFO, essentially <b>a</b> <b>Nazi</b> political commissar) post at Army Group B that had been vacant before his arrival. His habit of parroting the Führer's orders caused him to be viewed as a sycophant, even if he often undermined or ignored those orders in practice.|$|E
5|$|The {{characterization}} of Neville Sinclair {{was inspired by}} movie star Errol Flynn, or rather by the image of Flynn that had been popularized by Charles Higham's unauthorized and fabricated biography of the actor, in which he asserted that Flynn was, among other things, <b>a</b> <b>Nazi</b> spy. The film's Neville Sinclair is, like Higham's Flynn, a movie star known {{for his work in}} swashbuckler roles, and who is secretly <b>a</b> <b>Nazi</b> spy. Because Higham's biography of Flynn was not refuted until the late 1980s, the image of Flynn as a closet Nazi remained current all through the arduous process of writing and re-writing the script. The other real-life characterization was of Howard Hughes.|$|E
50|$|To the Victor is a 1948 drama film {{directed}} by Delmer Daves. It stars Dennis Morgan and Viveca Lindfors. The plot revolves around an American who {{falls in love}} with <b>a</b> <b>Nazi's</b> wife.|$|R

5|$|At Sinclair's home, Jenny {{discovers that}} he is <b>a</b> <b>Nazi</b> secret agent and knocks him out. She is later {{detained}} and forced {{to leave a message}} for Cliff to bring the rocket pack to the Griffith Observatory in exchange for her life. Just before he is arrested by the FBI and taken to Hughes and Peevy, Cliff hides the rocket pack. Hughes explains that his rocket pack is a prototype, similar to one that Nazi scientists have, up to now, been unsuccessful in developing, and shows them a horrifying propaganda film that reveals the scope of the Nazis' plans, depicting an army of flying soldiers invading the United States. The FBI agents mention that they are tracking <b>a</b> <b>Nazi</b> spy in Hollywood, whom Cliff realizes to be Sinclair. When Hughes demands the return of the rocket pack, Cliff explains that he needs it to rescue Jenny; he escapes, inadvertently leaving behind a clue to where he is headed.|$|E
5|$|Both Heinrich George and Werner Krauss {{were placed}} under arrest {{because of their}} past {{affiliation}} with the Nazi party. Although Heinrich George {{had been a member}} of the German Communist Party before the Nazi takeover, he was nonetheless interned as <b>a</b> <b>Nazi</b> collaborator at the Soviet special camp in Sachsenhausen where he died in 1946.|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>Nazi</b> Germany's defeat loomed in 1944-45, Scheel was {{furthermore}} made {{leader of}} the Volkssturm in the Gau of Salzburg. On 29 April 1945, Adolf Hitler, in his will, assigned Scheel {{to the position of}} Reich Minister for Science, National Education and Culture.|$|R

5|$|Conrad Veidt as Major Heinrich Strasser. He was {{a refugee}} German actor who had {{appeared}} in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. He fled the Nazis, but was frequently cast as <b>a</b> <b>Nazi</b> in American films. A major star in German cinema before the Nazi era, he was the highest paid member of the cast despite his second billing.|$|E
5|$|During this patrol, U-38 {{was able}} to land Walter Simon, <b>a</b> <b>Nazi</b> agent, at Dingle Bay in Ireland on 12 June. Not {{realising}} that the passenger services of the Tralee and Dingle Light Railway had been closed fourteen months earlier, he asked when the next train to Dublin was. He was arrested and interned in the Curragh Camp {{for the duration of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|Historian Thomas Vogel opines that Rommel was not <b>a</b> <b>Nazi,</b> if {{one uses}} the {{definition}} the Nazis themselves used, considering {{that although he}} did everything {{in his power to}} make his country strong again, he showed no support towards the racial policies or other aspects of the regime.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>Nazi</b> Germany's war fortune waned, the Finnish {{government}} {{tried to}} reach a peace agreement with the Soviet Union in March 1944, which was not popular in Berlin; and hence food and munitions shipments from the Third Reich to Finland were once again discontinued in March 1944.|$|R

5|$|On 29 October Banksy's art was {{displayed}} in a shop window, unbeknownst to the owners. Banksy had purchased a very basic painting of a landscape, added his own special touch {{in the form of}} <b>a</b> <b>Nazi</b> in full uniform resting on a bench and enjoying the view, and donated it back to the store, drastically increasing their patronage for the day.|$|E
5|$|Perceived by the West German {{government}} to be <b>a</b> <b>Nazi</b> organisation, HIAG was disbanded {{at the federal level}} in 1992. HIAG's last chairman was Hubert Meyer, who provided access to the previously closed HIAG archives to several researchers, including Parker. Parker used the HIAG materials in his 2014 study of Joachim Peiper.|$|E

According to 1939 census, 54 percent considered themselves Protestant, 40 percent Roman Catholic, 3.5 percent Gottgläubig (God-believing; <b>a</b> <b>Nazi</b> religious movement) and 1.5 percent nonreligious.|$|E
5|$|While in Germany, Victoria {{showed an}} {{interest}} in the Nazi Party, which appealed to her because of its anti-Bolshevik stance and her hope that the movement might help restore the Russian monarchy. She and Kirill attended <b>a</b> <b>Nazi</b> rally in Coburg in 1922 and Victoria donated money to the party. She was likely unaware of the most sinister aspects of the Nazi Party.|$|E
5|$|While {{the story}} was not based on a work by Ian Fleming, the title GoldenEye traces its origins to the name of Fleming's Jamaican estate where he wrote the Bond novels. Fleming gave a number of origins {{for the name of}} his estate, {{including}} Carson McCullers' Reflections in a Golden Eye and Operation Goldeneye, a contingency plan Fleming himself developed during World War II in case of <b>a</b> <b>Nazi</b> invasion through Spain.|$|E

Rudolf Brandt and Wolfram Sievers, {{general manager of the}} Ahnenerbe (<b>a</b> <b>Nazi</b> research institute), were responsible for delivering the skeletons to the collection of the Anatomy Institute at the Reich University of Strasbourg in the Alsace region of Occupied France. The collection was sanctioned by Himmler and under the direction of August Hirt. Ultimately 87 of the inmates were shipped to Natzweiler-Struthof and killed in August 1943. Brandt and Sievers were later convicted in the Doctors' Trial in Nuremberg.|$|E
5|$|As Germany's {{situation}} deteriorated, Hitler {{decided to}} form the Volkssturm, <b>a</b> <b>Nazi</b> Party local militia to defend communities within the Reich. On 24 September 1944, Hitler appointed his private secretary {{and head of the}} Reich Chancellery, Reichsleiter Martin Bormann {{to form the}} Volkssturm. Himmler was given responsibility for the military organisation and equipment of the new militia, which he delegated to Berger, who became one of two chiefs of staff for the organisation. Bormann resisted Berger's attempts to take over the Volkssturm, and it remained largely under Bormann's control, with local recruiting conducted by the Gauleiters.|$|E
