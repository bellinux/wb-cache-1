5|$|The prison barge was {{temporarily}} closed in August 1995 due to less crowded city jails, {{caused by a}} decline in <b>arrests</b> and inmate transfers. In late 1996, the prison was slated for reopening due to the rise in <b>arrests</b> from a campaign targeting drugs and drug dealers. The six-month campaign expected more than seven thousand additional <b>arrests</b> than usual, but the ship was not reopened until 1998 when it {{was used by the}} Department of Juvenile Justice. The Bain Center is currently used as a processing facility for inmates in the Department of Corrections system. There are three other processing facilities that each handle specific boroughs.|$|E

According to Nicolaevsky, however, Lenin abandoned attempts to exchange the notes after the <b>arrests,</b> but Bogdanov tried (and failed) to exchange some notes in North America, while Krasin succeeded in forging new serial numbers and managed to exchange several more notes. Soon after, Lenin's associates burned all the 500-ruble notes remaining in their possession.|$|E

5|$|Marsden first {{arrives in}} Albert Square in March 2001, {{investigating}} Phil Mitchell's shooting {{in her first}} case as detective chief inspector. She identifies the five main suspects: Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass), Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) and Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin). Marsden <b>arrests</b> Dan for the shooting, although he is later acquitted {{due to lack of}} evidence. Dan was set up by Phil but it was, in fact, Lisa who shot him. Marsden later <b>arrests</b> Little Mo Slater (Kacey Ainsworth) for the attempted murder of her husband Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns). Little Mo claims self-defence, since she has been a victim of domestic violence at the hands of Trevor. The trial ends, with Trevor's treatment of Little Mo revealed. In 2003, Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy) visits Marsden with evidence that Phil killed his ex-girlfriend Lisa. Jill helps set up a honey-trap for Phil in order to obtain a confession from him, with PC Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny) and DI Dominic Price (Paul Brennen), but it fails when Kate falls in love with Phil and Marsden fires her. Marsden <b>arrests</b> Phil, but with insufficient evidence and no confession he is released. It later emerges that Lisa is safe and well, and Phil is innocent. Marsden later <b>arrests</b> Phil when Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) set him up in an armed robbery.|$|E

40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} belief updating of {{the perceived}} probability of <b>arrest</b> and its criminal deterrence effects using two longitudinal data sources. While beliefs about the probability of <b>arrest</b> are positively correlated with local official <b>arrest</b> rates, they are unresponsive to information acquired from random individuals and local neighborhood conditions. Importantly, perceptions respond to changes in an individual's criminal and <b>arrest</b> history. Young males who engage in crime without getting <b>arrested</b> revise their perceived probability of <b>arrest</b> downward, while those who are <b>arrested</b> revise their probability upward. Estimates suggest that beliefs about the probability of <b>arrest</b> significantly deter crime. (JEL K 42) ...|$|R
