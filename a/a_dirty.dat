The street was very narrow and muddy, and the air was impregnated with filthy odours.|$|R

5|$|Unfortunately, as I tell {{my white}} friends, we as black people, we're {{never going to}} be {{successful}}, not because of you white people, but because of other black people. When you're black, {{you have to deal with}} so much crap in your life from other black people. It's <b>a</b> <b>dirty,</b> dark secret; I'm glad it's coming out. One of the reasons we're {{never going to be}} successful as a whole, because of other black people. And for some reason we are brainwashed to think, if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not a good black person. And it's <b>a</b> <b>dirty,</b> dark secret. There are a lot of black people who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock a successful black person down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful... We're the only ethnic group who say, 'Hey, if you go to jail, it gives you street cred.' It's just typical BS that goes on when you're black, man.|$|E

Lyrically, the duo touched upon a wide range of subject matter, including sexuality, politics, misogyny, African-American culture, parenthood, and introspection.

50|$|Set Variations: In {{some parts}} of Cyprus <b>a</b> <b>dirtied</b> hiliara (pentakosara) biriba is not worth {{anything}} more than 100 (instead of 500) even though the statistical possibility of getting a pentakosara is very low meaning it should be worth more than 100. This variation together with others that downplay points from specific game sets makes the game more luck oriented instead of strategy oriented.|$|R
60|$|Columbus Blackie, The General, and Dirty Eddie were {{formally}} presented. <b>As</b> <b>Dirty</b> Eddie was, physically, {{the cleanest}} {{member of the}} band the youth wondered how he had come by his sobriquet--that is, he wondered until he heard Dirty Eddie speak, after which {{he was no longer}} in doubt. The Oskaloosa Kid, self-confessed 'tramp' and burglar, flushed at the lurid obscenity of Dirty Eddie's remarks.|$|R
