40|$|AbstractStandard fare in {{the study}} of {{representations}} and decompositions of processes with independent increments is pursued in the somewhat more complex setting of vector-valued random fields having independent increments over disjoint sets. Such processes are first constructed as <b>almost</b> <b>surely</b> uniformly <b>convergent</b> sums of Poisson type summands, that immediately yield information on sample function properties of versions. The constructions employed, which include a generalized version of the Ferguson-Klass construction with uniform convergence, are new even in the simpler setting of processes in one-dimensional time. Following these constructions, or representations, an analogue of the Lévy-Ito decomposition for Lévy processes is developed, which then enables a number of simple sample function properties of these processes to be read off from the Lévy measure in their characteristic functionals. The paper concludes with a study of general centred additive random fields and an appendix incorporating a brief survey of the theory of centred sums of independent random variables...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with identifying the best decision among a set of possible decisions {{in the presence of}} uncertainty. We are primarily interested in situations where the objective function value at any feasible solution needs to be estimated, for example via a ``black-box' simulation procedure. We develop adaptive random search methods for solving such simulation optimization problems. The methods are adaptive {{in the sense that they}} use information gathered during previous iterations to decide how simulation effort is expended in the current iteration. We consider random search because such methods assume very little about the structure of the underlying problem, and hence can be applied to solve complex simulation optimization problems with little expertise required from an end-user. Consequently, such methods are suitable for inclusion in simulation software. We first identify desirable features that algorithms for discrete simulation optimization need to possess to exhibit attractive empirical performance. Our approach emphasizes maintaining an appropriate balance between exploration, exploitation, and estimation. We also present two new and <b>almost</b> <b>surely</b> <b>convergent</b> random search methods that possess these desirable features and demonstrate their empirical attractiveness. Second, we develop two frameworks for designing adaptive and <b>almost</b> <b>surely</b> <b>convergent</b> random search methods for discrete simulation optimization. Our frameworks involve averaging, in that all decisions that require estimates of the objective function values at various feasible solutions are based on the averages of all observations collected at these solutions so far. We present two new and <b>almost</b> <b>surely</b> <b>convergent</b> variants of simulated annealing and demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of averaging and adaptivity in the context of simulated annealing. Finally, we present three random search methods for solving simulation optimization problems with uncountable feasible regions. One of the approaches is adaptive, while the other two are based on pure random search. We provide conditions under which the three methods are convergent, both in probability and almost surely. Lastly, we include a computational study that demonstrates the effectiveness of the methods when compared to some other approaches available in the literature. Ph. D.

The weight factors correspond to complex multivariable functions, and their optimal values are dynamic depending on the time-varying network environment parameters. Therefore, the problem can be modeled as a simulation optimization problem, where the objective function cannot be evaluated exactly. Adaptive random search methods for the simulation optimization problem, which can maintain balance among exploration, exploitation, and estimation, are more effective [30, 31].

40|$|Abstract. The {{asymptotic}} behavior of estimates and information criteria in linear models are {{studied in the}} context of hierarchically correlated sampling units. The work is motivated by biological data collected on species where autocorrelation is based on the species ’ genealogical tree. Hierarchical autocorrelation is also found in many other kinds of data, such as from microarray experiments or human languages. Similar correlation also arises in ANOVA models with nested effects. I show that the best linear unbiased estimators are <b>almost</b> <b>surely</b> <b>convergent</b> but may not be consistent for some parameters such as the intercept and lineage effects, {{in the context of}} Brownian motion evolution on the genealogical tree. For the purpose of model selection I show that the usual BIC does not provide an appropriate approximation to the posterior probability of a model. To correct for this, an effective sample size is introduced for parameters that are inconsistently estimated. For biological studies, this work implies that tree-aware sampling design is desirable; adding more sampling units may not help ancestral reconstruction and only strong lineage effects may be detected with high power...|$|E
