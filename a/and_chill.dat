5|$|Madness {{were not}} only running their own label at the time, but also had their own {{recording}} studio, Liquidator Studios. The studio is still located on Caledonian Road in North London, in {{what was once the}} premises of their fan club office. They built a 24-track professional studio in the cellar. The ground floor has always been an office <b>and</b> <b>chill</b> out area, while a room upstairs is used for song mixing. The band have recorded a number of demos and b-sides at Liquidator, as well as The Madness album in 1988. Other acts to use the studio include Feargal Sharkey, The Farm, Apollo 440, The Potato 5, The Nutty Boys, The Deltones and The Butterfield 8. The studio is still regularly used by musicians, including members of Madness themselves.|$|E
5|$|Such large {{temperature}} variations have {{a destructive}} {{effect on the}} exposed rocky surfaces. The repeated fluctuations put a strain on exposed rock and the flanks of mountains crack and shatter. Fragmented strata slide down into the valleys where they continue to break into pieces due to the relentless sun by day <b>and</b> <b>chill</b> by night. Successive strata are exposed to further weathering. The relief of the internal pressure that has built up in rocks that have been underground for aeons can cause them to shatter. Exfoliation also occurs when the outer surfaces of rocks split off in flat flakes. This {{is believed to be}} caused by the stresses put on the rock by repeated expansions and contractions which induces fracturing parallel to the original surface. Chemical weathering processes probably play a more important role in deserts than was previously thought. The necessary moisture may be present in the form of dew or mist. Ground water may be drawn to the surface by evaporation and the formation of salt crystals may dislodge rock particles as sand or disintegrate rocks by exfoliation. Shallow caves are sometimes formed at the base of cliffs by this means.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to corporate business interests, {{there are many}} retail shops in Chattanooga, including two shopping malls: Hamilton Place Mall in East Brainerd and Northgate Mall in Hixson. Eastgate Mall in Brainerd {{used to be a}} shopping mall, but has changed into a multi-use office building. The P.F. Chang's restaurant at Hamilton Place Mall has had a unique theme since the restaurant opened in November 2006: water, based on the fundamental role the Tennessee River plays in Chattanooga {{and the fact that the}} CEO of P.F. Chang's since 2000, Richard Federico, is a 1976 alumnus of the University of Tennessee and has family in Chattanooga. In December 2001, Chattanooga was the site of the first two Dairy Queen Grill <b>and</b> <b>Chill</b> restaurants in the United States.|$|E

25|$|DQ Grill & Chill {{locations}} feature hot food, treats, table {{delivery and}} self-serve soft drinks. It {{is the new}} concept for new and renovated full-service restaurants. Stores are larger than older-style locations and feature a completely new store design. In most cases, they offer an expanded menu including breakfast, Grill Burgers, and grilled sandwiches, as well as limited table service (customers still place orders at the counter). They also contain self-serve soft drink fountains allowing free refills. Some of the older stores have upgraded to the new format. However, there are still older stores and stores that have not upgraded to the new format.

500|$|The band began {{recording}} demos of {{new material}} in 2009. All three members brought song ideas that {{they worked on}} for years. As the band got back together, Barker said that the trio immediately [...] "got inspired" [...] by practicing their old songs and listening to them again, {{and they decided to}} record demos. There were four demos done, and only one was near completion, [...] "Up All Night". The trio wanted to release it as a single then, but quickly they realized that it was too ambitious to complete it before their reunion tour began in July. Sessions were stalled by the summer 2009 reunion tour, during which the band reconnected musically and emotionally. During the tour, Barker got the phone call that DJ AM had overdosed and died in New York, which heavily affected him. In addition to the tragedy regarding DJ AM, DeLonge was diagnosed with skin cancer the following year, but it eventually was cleared. The band did a large amount of writing before leaving on tour, but upon completion of the tour, they took time off to [...] "take a couple of months <b>and</b> <b>chill</b> and do other stuff," [...] with intentions to regroup in 2010. In June and July 2010, the band spent time at their rehearsal spot, and their intention was to wrap up touring by September, and stay in the studio {{for the rest of the}} year until the album was finished. The album sessions were to be partially documented in The Blinkumentary, which was scrapped in 2012.|$|E

500|$|Inafune {{created the}} {{character}} Zero, whom he {{originally intended to}} be the game's main, playable protagonist. [...] "When the X series came out, I really wanted to redesign Mega Man," [...] Inafune explained. [...] "I wanted a totally different Mega Man. I’m a designer, a creator; I wanted something new. I didn’t {{want to use the}} same old Mega Man." [...] Fearing a negative reaction from fans, Zero was ultimately reduced to a role secondary to Mega Man X. The development team additionally wanted the world of Mega Man X to be much more sophisticated than in the first Mega Man series. They wanted to accomplish this with Zero's [...] "hardcore" [...] personality and the game's antagonist Sigma. As stated by Inafune, the original series' villain Dr. Wily had [...] "a side to him you couldn't really hate". Sigma, however, was written as a once-good character suffering an [...] "unforeseen error" [...] that leads him to be completely evil. The game's story went through several changes during development. Two allies of Mega Man X, named RX and RY, appeared in previews for the game, but were later taken out. Mega Man X altered the franchise tradition of having themed boss characters with a [...] "Man" [...] moniker by replacing them with anthropomorphic animal-like androids. The art and pixelization for these eight bosses were divided among three illustrators: Inafune did Storm Eagle <b>and</b> <b>Chill</b> Penguin; Kaji did Spark Mandrill, Launch Octopus, and Sting Chameleon; and Kazunori Tazaki (credited as Ikki) did Flame Mammoth, Armored Armadillo, and Boomer Kuwanger. The team was careful in making the bosses distinct from one another in both stature and coloring. Tatsuya Yoshikawa (credited as Tatsunoko), a fourth artist who had recently been hired by Capcom, was given the task of assisting {{the rest of the team}} by designing, illustrating, and creating the sprites for the game's minor enemies. The musical score for Mega Man X was composed by Capcom's Alph Lyla group. Setsuo Yamamoto (credited as Setsuo) was initially the sole composer assigned to the game, and contributed the vast majority of the soundtrack, but four other composers, Yuki Iwai (credited as Sato), Toshihiko Horiyama (credited as Kirry), Yuko Takehara (credited as Yuko) and Makoto Tomozawa (credited as Tomozou), were brought in late in production to help finish the soundtrack. Iwai and Horiyama would later compose the soundtracks for Mega Man X2 and X4 respectively. The Japanese division of Sony Records published an arranged album featuring ten songs on March 9, 1994. Music using the SNES instrumentals was included as part of the Capcom Music Generation: Rockman X1 ~ X6 soundtrack released by Suleputer in 2003.|$|E

2500|$|The {{music video}} of Jennifer Lopez's song, [...] "Dance Again", which aired on the program, was criticized as {{inappropriate}} for younger viewers. Dan Gainor of the Culture and Media Institute wrote, [...] "Even the supposedly family-friendly TV shows like American Idol are never {{safe in the}} hands of Hollywood," [...] and went as far as saying her [...] "skanky new video shows how desperate she is to retain her fame despite her fading relevance. Such sexualized videos aren't appropriate for any children to watch, including Lopez's own twins." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein from MTV Buzzworthy also commented about the video's content not being appropriate for a family show, [...] "we thought [...] "Idol" [...] was a family show? This video is less [...] "sit on the couch <b>and</b> <b>chill</b> with dad" [...] and more [...] "call your boyfriend over immediately."

Entertainment Weeklys Marc Snetiker observed that although the song was [...] "relatively harmless and catchy, the video is...confusing", but thought it was worth watching. Jenna Hally, writing for MTV Buzzworthy, praised Lopez in the music video, writing [...] "holy moly, how can this woman have birthed two humans and still look this amazing?", however {{felt that it was}} inappropriate for its American Idol debut, adding [...] "we thought [...] "Idol" [...] was a family show?

2500|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} {{successful}} mainstream Filipino-American rappers is The Black Eyed Peas's apl.de.ap, who has released songs such as [...] "The Apl Song" [...] (Elephunk), [...] "Bebot" [...] (Monkey Business), and [...] "Mare" [...] (The E.N.D.) which not only contain Filipino (Tagalog) lyrics but also native Filipino musical elements. Pineda has also founded his own record label, the Los Angeles-based Jeepney Music, to help discover and promote Filipino hip-hop talent from both the United States and the Philippines. [...] "The APL Song" [...] not only contains elements of Tagalog and Filipino elements, but the track itself according to video producer, Christina DeHaven, represents Allan Pineda Lindo's view of the Philippines when he travels back for the first time since he was 14 years old. In the English verses of the song Allan Pineda Lindo describes aspects of Filipino life back home which is seen in the lyrics, [...] "How would you feel if you had to catch your meal, Build a hut to live and to eat <b>and</b> <b>chill</b> in, Having to pump the water outta the ground?". The shifting between Tagalog and English can be interpreted as showing both languages as equal or in an equal hierarchical relationship to one another which is especially important having included another language than English in American Pop song, even though English is one of two of the Official language's of the Philippines.|$|E
