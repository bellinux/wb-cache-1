500|$|Editors' first album, The Back Room, was {{described}} as having <b>a</b> <b>wiry</b> and raw sound, which led it to being famously dubbed 'dark disco' by the NME. This sound {{was created by the}} use of synthesizers, catchy guitar riffs and simple, ambiguous lyrics. An End Has a Start showed progression to a new 'bigger' sound. This new sound was created by adding more textured layers to the songs as well as incorporating new forms of music into them. These include the adding of a choir in [...] "Smokers Outside the Hospital Doors" [...] and the inclusion of the sounds of the band playing Hide-and-seek in the song [...] "Spiders".|$|E
500|$|The Scottish Terrier (also {{known as}} the Aberdeen Terrier), popularly called the Scottie, is a breed of dog. Initially one of the {{highland}} breeds of terrier that were grouped {{under the name of}} Skye Terrier, it is one of five breeds of terrier that originated in Scotland, the other four being the modern Skye, Cairn, Dandie Dinmont, and West Highland White Terriers. They are an independent and rugged breed with <b>a</b> <b>wiry</b> outer coat and a soft dense undercoat. The First Earl of Dumbarton nicknamed the breed [...] "the diehard". The modern breed is said to be able to trace its lineage back to a single female, named Splinter II.|$|E
500|$|The breed was {{developed}} between 1850 and 1891 by Captain John Edwardes, at Sealyham House, near Wolfscastle in the Welsh county of Pembrokeshire. Originally the breed {{was used for}} pest control, to hunt small game and to eliminate vermin [...] particularly badgers which he usually relocated. The Welsh Corgi, Fox Terrier (Wire), and the now extinct English White Terrier all {{played a part in}} the make up of the Sealyham, although Edwardes did not keep records. He wanted a small white dog with a strong jaw, and <b>a</b> <b>wiry</b> coat. The white coat was particularly prized, as it meant that the hunter in the field could distinguish the dogs from the quarry. Edwardes culled weak dogs, and bred the stronger ones. After Edwardes' death in 1891, other breeders began to work with Sealyhams, including Fred Lewis who promoted the breed.|$|E

2500|$|On March 17, 1974, García {{was visiting}} {{with some friends}} in her apartment. Medrano also had a guest, with whom he was smoking marijuana. Louie Castillo and Miguel Jimenez, Soledad locals and acquaintances of Medrano, arrived {{in a state of}} {{inebriation}} to purchase heroin from Medrano. They began harassing García and her friends, who left García and the others at the apartment. Soon an argument arose between Medrano and Castillo, who was envious of Medrano's status as the primary drug connection in Soledad and was resentful that an [...] "outsider" [...] had become so successful. The argument became physical, and Medrano was winning the fight (Castillo was <b>a</b> <b>wiry</b> seventeen-year-old) until the 300-pound Jimenez intervened, beating Medrano and threatening him with a knife. Jimenez and Castillo took García to an alley behind the building where Jimenez restrained and Castillo raped her, according to García's testimony, [...] "to show me what a hometown boy was." [...] The two men left the scene for a neighbor's house. Shortly after arriving, they (or someone else) called the García-Medrano residence, laughing, taunting, and threatening García's life if she did not leave town. García armed herself with her son's [...]22 rifle and she and Medrano drove the six blocks to the residence where Castillo and Jimenez were located. Accounts vary as to precisely what occurred next, but by most of them, Jimenez again brandished his knife and García shot him. Castillo, meanwhile, escaped into a nearby park. Medrano and García continued to the home of the two friends that had visited her earlier, and when police arrived, she surrendered to them without incident.|$|E
