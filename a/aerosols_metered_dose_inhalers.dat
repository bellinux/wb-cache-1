40|$|A {{prospective}} study of <b>inhaler</b> technique using <b>aerosol</b> <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhalers</b> (MDIs), Rotahalers and a breath-activated device (Aerolin Autohaler) was undertaken {{to assess how}} effectively elderly patients use their inhalers. Fifty-one patients aged 67 - 89 years (mean 77. 4 years) were enrolled. Peak flow, FEVj and FVC were recorded, before and after inhalation of 2. 5 mg of salbutamol via a nebulizer, to assess the extent of reversible airways obstruction. Inhaler technique was assessed using a scoring system, based on performance in five aspects of inhaler use. Those with poor technique were randomly allocated to an alternative inhaler and reassessed. Twenty-nine of 51 patients demonstrated reversibility in their airways disease. Twenty-one of 47 had poor technique using an MDI and were given Rotahaler or Aerolin devices to use. Ten of 11 given Aerolin Autohalers improved but seven of ten using Rotahaler showed no improvement (p = 0. 006). Subsequently, five of these seven were able to improve their technique with the breath-activated autohaler. The breath-activated Aerolin Autohaler is a better delivery system than Rotahalers for inhaled bronchodilators for elderly patients...|$|R
40|$|There is much {{interest}} {{in the use of}} holding chambers with an attached facemask to deliver <b>aerosols</b> from <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhalers</b> to infants. In order to study the influence of various design factors on the dose inhaled at different tidal volumes, a model was constructed in which a Starling ventilator was used to generate an inspiratory/expiratory cycle across a filter. Sodium cromoglycate was administered via a Nebuhaler and mask, Aerochamber and mask, and a coffee cup using tidal volumes of 25, 50, and 150 ml and the dose deposited upon the filter after six breaths was assayed using an ultraviolet spectrophotometric method. At the lowest tidal volume the high aerosol concentration in the smaller chamber enhanced drug delivery while at the highest tidal volume delivery was greatest from the larger chamber reflecting the larger dose available. Multiple breaths ensured that the dose inhaled per kilogram from each chamber was relatively large and also permitted significant drug delivery despite the introduction of a relatively large dead space between valve and filter. The dose delivered was increased by increasing the dose introduced into the chamber though not proportionately. These devices appear likely to deliver significant quantities of aerosol to infants, though drug delivery may be enhanced by the use of an appropriate valve...|$|R
40|$|Rapid and {{reliable}} {{in vitro methods}} of analysis of aerosol particles are required in product development to ensure product safety and to attain process control quality to establish reproducibility of inhalation aerosols. The particle size distribution for beclomethasone dipropionate delivered from Becotide ® and Respocort ® inhalers was estimated using an Andersen Cascade Impactor and a scanning electron microscope coupled with an automated image analysis technique. The particle area and the volume-weighted distribution were estimated and compared to the volume-weighted distribution generated using a laser diffraction technique. No {{significant differences in the}} measurement of the particle size distributions using either area or the volume-weighted distributions for the small particles were evident. An alternative optical sizing method is described to evaluate particle size distribution and morphology of <b>aerosols</b> administered in <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhalers</b> using a cascade impactor and a scanning electron microscope.

40|$|In an open {{randomised}} parallel-group study, 1004 {{patients with}} asthma in 7 countries were randomised to receive asthma treatment via 2 {{different kinds of}} inhalers: an <b>aerosol</b> pressurised <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> (pMDI) and a dry powder inhaler (Turbuhaler(R)). The patients were treated for 52 weeks with inhaled corticosteroids and/or inhaled beta(2) -agonists. All patients were considered adequately treated with inhaled corticosteroids and/or inhaled beta(2) -agonists via pMDI before inclusion in the study. Healthcare utilisation variables were attached to the case record forms of the patients, thus making an economic analysis possible. Because {{of the difficulty of}} comparing costs between countries, each country was analysed separately. Canadian patients constituted the largest subpopulation (445 patients) and were therefore used in this analysis. From the analysis, we concluded that the effectiveness of treatment (measured as the number of exacerbations and days with exacerbation) was significantly better for patients treated via Turbuhaler(R) than via a pMDI (p = 0. 03). Furthermore, the total annual costs of treatment were, on average, $Can 331 less (p < 0. 01) for patients using Turbuhaler(R) than for those using a pMDI (mainly due to lower costs for hospitalisation and medication). The cost differences between inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled beta(2) -agonists were significantly in favour of treatment via Turbuhaler(R) (p < 0. 01). Thus, {{the results of this study}} suggest that treatment via Turbuhaler(R) is a cost-effective strategy in patients with asthma in Canada...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSpacing devices improve lung {{deposition}} of <b>aerosols</b> from <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhalers</b> (MDI) {{but it is}} sometimes difficult for dyspnoeic patients to perform maximal breaths with breath-holds needed to inhale the aerosols from them. Our aim {{was to determine whether}} the response to bronchodilators (BD) depended on the method of inhalation. We studied 20 patients with moderately severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) {{with a mean age of}} 68 years and a mean of forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV 1) of 41 % predicted. In a randomized, cross-over fashion they inhaled terbutaline 1 · 5 mg (six puffs) followed by ipratropium 120 μ g (six puffs) via MDI and nebuhaler with either two inspirations to total lung capacity and a 10 -sec breath-hold per puff or with six tidal breaths per puff. Before and after BDs we measured FEV 1, forced vital capacity (FVC), airways resistance using interrupter method (Rint) and 6 -min walking distance (6 MWD). Subsequently, we re-tested nine of these patients with the two methods of inhalation, before and after conventional doses (terbutaline 500 μ g+ipratropium 40 μ g), then after terbutaline 1 mg and ipratropium 80 μ g and finally after nebulized terbutaline 5 mg and ipratropium 500 μ g to see whether there was a dose-dependent difference in effect between the two methods. Spirometry, slow vital capacity (SVC), inspiratory capacity and shuttle walking tests were monitored. In the original 20 patients there were highly significant improvements in all parameters after inhalers, with no significant difference between methods of inhalation. Median improvements after BDs were: FEV 10 · 221 and 0 · 191, FVC 0 · 501 and 0 · 381 and 6 MWD 40 m and 44 m, for maximal breaths and tidal breathing, respectively. For nine patients, tidal and maximal breaths produced similar effects on lung function and exercise tolerance at both doses of BDs. Nebulized BDs only improved shuttle distances slightly when compared with either method of inhalation from MDI and spacer but had no additional effect on lung function. In conclusion, in patients with moderately severe COPD, BDs given by <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> via nebuhaler have similar effects whether given by six easy tidal breaths or the more difficult two maximal breaths with breath-hold. This holds true at small or larger doses of BD. Either method of inhaling six puffs of the BDs can be used as an effective alternative to nebulized aerosol...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] <b>Aerosols</b> {{generated}} from <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhalers</b> may be highly charged. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine whether lining the walls of a polycarbonate spacer device with an antistatic agent would result in an increase in drug output. The effects of multiple actuations of drug into the spacer device and increasing residence time of drug within the spacer were also determined. METHODS [...] The amount of sodium cromoglycate contained in particles of various size available for inhalation (per 5 mg actuation) from a 750 ml polycarbonate spacer was determined by impinger measurement and spectrophotometric assay. RESULTS [...] Lining the spacer with an antistatic agent increased the mean (SD) amount of sodium cromoglycate in particles < 5 microns available for inhalation (per 5 mg actuation) by 244 % from (0. 59 (0. 03) to 1. 44 (0. 2) mg). When there was a 20 second interval between actuation into the spacer device and inhalation, sodium cromoglycate available for inhalation in particles < 5 micrograms decreased by 67 % (from 0. 59 (0. 03) mg to 0. 2 (0. 01) mg). Use of the spacer device increased sodium cromoglycate available for inhalation in respirable particles (< 5 microns) by 18 % compared with direct delivery by <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler.</b> Multiple actuations into the spacer decreased the amount of sodium cromoglycate available for inhalation in particles < 5 microns by 31 % after two actuations and 56 % after three acutations. CONCLUSIONS [...] Multiple actuations of sodium cromoglycate into a spacer device before inhalation should be avoided, and inhalation from spacer devices should take place immediately after actuation to ensure maximum dose. Lining of a standard spacer device with an antistatic agent significantly increased output of sodium cromoglycate. This may have implications for improved therapeutic response and drug cost...|$|R

This paper describes the design and evolution of this innovative device from a laboratory concept model and the challenges that were overcome during its development and scaleup to mass production. A key technical breakthrough was the uniblock, a component combining filters and nozzles and made of silicon and glass, through which drug solution is forced using mechanical power. This allows two converging jets of solution to collide at a controlled angle, generating a fine aerosol of inhalable droplets. The mechanical energy comes from a spring which is tensioned by twisting the base of the device before use. Additional features of the Respimat&reg; SMI include a dose indicator and a lockout mechanism to avoid the problems of tailing-off of dose size seen with pressurized <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhalers.</b> The Respimat&reg; SMI aerosol cloud has a unique range of technical properties. The high fine particle fraction allied with the low velocity and long generation time of the aerosol translate into a higher fraction of the emitted dose being deposited in the lungs compared with <b>aerosols</b> from pressurized <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhalers</b> and dry powder inhalers. These advantages are realized in clinical trials in adults and children with obstructive lung diseases, which have shown that the efficacy and safety of a pressurized <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> formulation of a combination bronchodilator can be matched by a Respimat&reg; SMI formulation containing only one half or one quarter of the dose delivered by a pressurized <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler.</b> Patient satisfaction with the Respimat&reg; SMI is high, and the long duration of the spray is of potential benefit to patients who have difficulty in coordinating inhalation with drug release.

A breath actuated pressurised inhaler, designed to help patients with poor inhaler technique, was compared with a conventional <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> in terms of aerosol deposition and bronchodilator response. METHODS Radioaerosol deposition and bronchodilator response to 100 micrograms salbutamol were measured in 18 asthmatic patients, who inhaled from a conventional <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> by their own chosen <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> technique, from a conventional <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> by a taught <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> technique, and from a breath actuated pressured inhaler (Autohaler). RESULTS In the 10 patients who could coordinate actuation and inhalation of the inhaler on their own deposition of aerosol in the lungs and bronchodilator response were equivalent on the three study days. By contrast, in the eight patients who could not coordinate the mean (SEM) percentage of the dose deposited in the lungs with their own inhaler technique (7. 2 % (3. 4 %] was substantial lower than those attained by the taught <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> technique (22. 8 % (2. 5 %] and by Autohaler (20. 8 % (1. 7 %]. CONCLUSION Although of little additional benefit to asthmatic patients with good coordination, the Autohaler is potentially a valuable aid to those with poor coordination, and {{should be considered in}} preference to a conventional <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> in any patient whose inhaler technique is not known to be satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the aerosol-release time in the development of a new automatic adapter for <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler.</b> With this device, regular manually operated <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhalers</b> become automatic. During the study, an inhalation simulator was designed and tested with the newly developed mechatronic system. By adjusting the volume and the pressure of the vacuum tank, most human inhalation waveforms were able to simulate. As an example, regular quick-deep and slow-deep waveforms were matched within reasonable accuracy. Finally, with the help of dynamic image processing, the aerosol-release time (Tr) was carefully measured and fully discussed, including the switch-on time (Ts), the mechatronics-hysteresis (Tm) and the intentional-delay (Ti). Under slow-deep inhalation condition which is suitable for <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> medicine delivery, the switch-on flow-rate could reach as low as 10 [*]L/min, and the corresponding switch-on time was approximately 0. 20 [*]s. While the mechatronics-hysteresis depended on the brand of <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler,</b> assuming there was no intentional-delay, the aerosol-release time could be as low as 0. 40 and 0. 60 [*]s, respectively, for two commercially available <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhalers</b> studied in this article.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The 30 {{minute and}} 24 hour post-inhalation urinary {{excretion}} of salbutamol represents the relative amount of drug {{deposited in the}} lungs and total systemic absorption, respectively. Using this method two <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhalers</b> used with a Volumatic (Allen and Hanburys Ltd, UK) large volume spacer have been compared. METHOD [...] Eleven healthy volunteers inhaled 4 x 100 micrograms salbutamol from either a generic salbutamol (Baker Norton, UK) or Ventolin (Allen and Hanburys Ltd, UK) <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> with a Volumatic. The order of administration was randomised with a seven day washout period. Urine samples were collected for 0 - 30 minutes and then pooled up to 24 hours after inhalation. RESULTS [...] The mean (SD) urinary salbutamol excretion 30 minutes after inhalation with the <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhalers</b> used with the Volumatic was 22. 22 (4. 63) and 21. 30 (5. 91) micrograms for the Baker Norton and Ventolin respectively, with a mean difference (95 % confidence interval (CI)) of 0. 92 (- 0. 65 to 2. 49) micrograms. Similar amounts were excreted up to 24 hours after the dose with a mean (SD) urinary excretion of 116. 1 (24. 3) micrograms and 114. 8 (22. 3) micrograms, respectively, and a mean difference (95 % CI) of 1. 22 (- 20. 39 to 22. 84) micrograms.

40|$|The {{current work}} {{focuses on the}} {{development}} and evaluation of techniques and models that can facilitate the development of solution based <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhalers.</b> These include an online reverse phase hplc method for analyte quantitation from propellant based pressurized <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhalers.</b> The technique (direct injection method) finds applications in determining solubility of compounds in aerosol propellants and can possibly be used for stability analysis. With {{the development of this}} technique it would be feasible to generate a solubility database {{in order to understand the}} physico-chemical factors affecting the solubility and also possibly predict the solubility of compounds in HFA 134 a propellant. The regular solution theory based on solubility parameter approach was evaluated for this purpose by utilizing a set of 35 diverse compounds in HFA 134 a. A new product performance evaluation tool; the Model 3320 series Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) used in conjunction with Model 3320 Impactor Inlet was evaluated for analysis of solution <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhalers.</b> The Model 3320 APS series provides rapid aerodynamic size distribution data and coupled with Model 3306 Impactor Inlet allows for the chemical analysis of the Inlet port, 'respirable' mass and 'non-respirable' mass. It was shown that in order to obtain comparable results between the Model 3306 Impactor Inlet and the Andersen Cascade Impactor (ACI), an extension to the USP throat may be necessary. The solubility data generated by the direct injection method coupled with the 'respirable deposition' data generated using the APS 3320 series can be used to optimize the product performance of cosolvent based solution <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhalers...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect on}} aerosol {{deposition}} from a pressurised <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> of a 750 cm 3 spacer device with a one way inhalation valve (Nebuhaler, Astra Pharmaceuticals) {{was assessed by}} means of an in vivo radiotracer technique. Nine patients with obstructive lung disease took part in the study. The pattern of deposition associated with use of a <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> alone was compared with that achieved with the spacer used both for inhalation of single puffs of aerosol and for inhalation of four puffs actuated in rapid succession and then inhaled simultane-ously. On each occasion there was a delay of 1 s between aerosol release and inhalation, simulat-ing poor inhaler technique. With the <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> alone, a mean (SEM) 8 - 7 (1 - 8) % of the dose reached the lungs and 80 * 9 (1 9) % was deposited in the oropharynx. With single puffs from the spacer 20 - 9 (1. 6) % of the dose (p < 0. 01) reached the lungs, only 16 - 5 (2. 3) % (p < 0. 01) was deposited in the oropharynx, and 55 - 8 (3 1) % was retained within the spacer itself. With four puffs from the spacer 15 - 2 (1. 5) % reached the lungs (p = 0 - 02 compared with the <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> alone, p < 0 - 01 compared with single puffs from the spacer), 11 - 4 (1. 2) % was deposited in the oropharynx, and 67 * 5 (1. 8) % in the device itself.

40|$|The {{deposition}} of particulate suspensions delivered from a <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> {{has been investigated}} extensively. The distribution of propellant, delivered from a <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler,</b> was studied by radiolabelling it with technetium- 99 m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime. Andersen sampler measurements indicated {{that half of the}} dose was associated with particles in the size range 0. 5 - 5 microns diameter. The preparation was administered to healthy subjects by inhalation and deposition was monitored with a gamma camera. Each lung image was divided into an inner, mid, and peripheral zone. The effects on {{deposition of}} varying the size of the delivery orifice (0. 46, 0. 61, and 0. 76 mm internal diameters) and the effect of attaching a spacer were assessed. Lung deposition was independent of the orifice size within the actuator. Without the spacer the average dose deposited in the lungs was 39 %, with 15 % penetrating into the peripheral part of the lungs. Attachment of the spacer to the mouth-piece increased the mean lung deposition to 57 % and reduced oropharyngeal deposition.

40|$|Abstract Background There are no {{published}} {{studies that have}} compared bronchodilatory effect of inhaled budesonide/formoterol combination with budesonide/salbutamol delivered by <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> with a spacer in acute exacerbation of asthma in children. We, therefore, compared the bronchodilatory effects of inhaled budesonide/formoterol (dose: 200 μg and 12 μg respectively) combination with budesonide (200 μg) /salbutamol (200 μg) administered by <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> and spacer in children of 5 - 15 years with mild acute exacerbation of asthma [Modified Pulmonary Index Score (MPIS) between 6 - 8] in this double-blind, randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome was FEV 1 (% predicted) {{in the two groups}} at 1, 5, 15, 30, 60 min after administration of the study drug. Results We did not observe any significant differences in the % predicted FEV 1 and MPIS between formoterol and salbutamol at various time points from 1 min to 60 min post drug administration. There was significant improvement in FEV 1 (% predicted) from baseline in both the groups as early as 1 min after drug administration. Conclusions Salbutamol or formoterol delivered along with inhaled corticosteroid by <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> with spacer in children between 5 - 15 years of age with mild acute exacerbation of asthma had similar bronchodilatory effects.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether significant differences exist in lung bioavailability between generic (Salamol, Salbulin) and innovator (Ventolin) formulations of inhaled salbutamol given by <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhalers.</b> METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers of mean age 20. 5 years with a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) of 112. 1 % predicted were studied in a randomised double blind single dosing crossover study. Salbutamol, 1200 micrograms, was given with mouth rinsing and lung bioavailability was assessed by measuring plasma salbutamol levels and urine excretion of salbutamol. RESULTS: No differences were seen between innovator and generic salbutamol <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhalers</b> in plasma salbutamol levels, urinary salbutamol excretion, or extrapulmonary beta 2 activity. The maximum plasma salbutamol concentration (mean Cmax) and time to maximum concentration (median Tmax) were: Ventolin (2. 93 ng/ml, 10 minutes), Salbulin (3. 01 ng/ml, 10 minutes), Salamol (3. 33 ng/ml, 10 minutes). The geometric mean ratio and 95 % confidence interval for Cmax were: Salbulin/Ventolin 1. 02 (0. 69 to 1. 41) and Salamol/Ventolin 1. 13 (0. 94 to 1. 35).

40|$|BACKGROUND: beta Agonists {{have been}} shown to {{increase}} mucociliary clearance in some studies but not all. Whether the formulation of beta agonists affects mucociliary clearance is not known but may be important as the use of dry powder inhalers increases. METHODS: The effect of different methods of administration of inhaled terbutaline on mucociliary clearance and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) was assessed in 10 patients with asthma and 10 healthy subjects. Terbutaline (1 mg) was administered through a <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> with a spacer (Nebuhaler) or a dry powder inhaler (Turbuhaler), or both treatments were given, in a four way double blind, double dummy trial. Mucociliary clearance was measured by bronchoscintigraphy. RESULTS: Clearance of radioactivity from the lobar bronchi increased in the asthmatic patients by a median of 32 % after terbutaline was given by <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> and 55 % after a combined dose of 2 mg from both inhalers (1 mg from each) compared with placebo but by only 9 % after 1 mg of terbutaline was given by a dry powder inhaler. In the healthy subjects mucociliary clearance increased by 51 % when terbutaline was given by a dry powder inhaler, by 66 % when given by a <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler,</b> and by 66 % when given by both inhalers combined. The effect of terbutaline on FEV 1 was the same with each of the inhalers. CONCLUSION: Despite similar changes in FEV 1 with the two formulations terbutaline increased mucociliary clearance significantly in asthmatic and healthy subjects when inhaled from a <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> whereas when it was inhaled from a dry powder inhaler its effect was significant only in healthy subjects. The reason for the difference in asthmatic subjects is unclear, but may be associated with differences in the deposition of terbutaline...|$|R
