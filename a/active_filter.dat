Practical 1H inductors require many {{turns on a}} high-permeability core; that material will have high losses and stability issues (e.g., a large temperature coefficient). For applications such as a mains filters, the awkwardness must be tolerated. For low-level, low-frequency, applications, RC filters are possible, but they cannot implement filters with complex poles or zeros. If the application can use power, then amplifiers {{can be used to}} make RC active filters that can have complex poles and zeros. In the 1950s, Sallen–Key active RC filters were made with vacuum tube amplifiers; these filters replaced the bulky inductors with bulky and hot vacuum tubes. Transistors offered more power-efficient <b>active</b> <b>filter</b> designs. Later, inexpensive operational amplifiers enabled other active RC filter design topologies. Although <b>active</b> <b>filter</b> designs were commonplace at {{low frequencies}}, they were impractical at high frequencies where the amplifiers were not ideal; LC (and transmission line) filters were still used at radio frequencies.|$|E

2500|$|Careful {{design of}} {{each stage of}} an {{open-loop}} (non-feedback) amplifier can achieve about 1% distortion for audio-frequency signals. With negative feedback, 0.001% is typical. [...] Noise, even crossover distortion, can be practically eliminated. [...] Negative feedback also compensates for changing temperatures, and degrading or nonlinear components in the gain stage, but any change or nonlinearity in the components in the feedback loop will affect the output.

40|$|Power {{electronic}} converters (e. g. AC-DC and DC-AC) produce harmonics which {{distorting the}} waveforms of voltage and current. Many research works have examined various techniques to mitigate harmonics at operating conditions (i. e. {{at a fixed}} line frequency and a specific load) such as: (i) passive filters, (ii) Current-injection converters, (iii) <b>active</b> <b>filters</b> and (iv) hybrid <b>filters.</b> <b>Active</b> <b>filters</b> are widely used with three-phase bridge rectifiers due to their excellent features for reducing harmonics using power switches instead of passive components that minimize {{the efficiency of the}} system. This paper investigates the robustness and the dynamic performance of <b>active</b> <b>filters</b> under the variation of line frequency and DC load. In case of using <b>active</b> <b>filters,</b> it is observed that total harmonic distortion (THD) of voltage and current waveforms is kept at IEEE Standard limits (i. e. less than 5 %)  under the variation of line frequency. Whilst the performance of passive filters is highly affected by the variations of line frequency and THD of voltage and current waveforms is always greater than 5 % except at designed frequency, i. e. 50 Hz. Moreover the load is changed from full-load to half-load, it is observed that the dynamic response of <b>active</b> <b>filters</b> is faster than passive filters for canceling harmonics. It is worth noting that the hysteresis-current-control method is utilized for adjusting the control pulses of <b>active</b> <b>filters</b> due to its rapid dynamic responsem.

In first steps to utilize the matrix converter as a motor drive and a shunt <b>active</b> power <b>filter</b> the control systems for the Permanent magnet synchronous machine, shunt <b>active</b> power <b>filter</b> and 3 -phase LC-filter are built. In second steps the simulation result of the matrix converter as motor drive and shunt <b>active</b> power <b>filter</b> is compared with the Back-to-Back voltage source converter in terms of <b>active</b> <b>filtering.</b> The simulation {{results show that the}} matrix converter can operate as motor drive very well, but it cannot operate as a shunt <b>active</b> power <b>filter</b> at the same time.
