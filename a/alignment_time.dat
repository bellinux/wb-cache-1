40|$|Abstract—We have {{recently}} {{found that the}} computation time of homology-based subcellular localization can be substantially reduced by aligning profiles up to the cleavage site positions of signal peptides, mitochondrial targeting peptides, and chloroplast transit peptides [1]. While the method can reduce the profile <b>alignment</b> <b>time</b> {{by as much as}} 20 folds, it cannot reduce the computation time spent on creating the profiles. In this paper, we propose a new approach that can reduce both the profile creation time and profile <b>alignment</b> <b>time.</b> In the new approach, instead of cutting the profiles, we shorten the sequences by cutting them at the cleavage site locations. The shortened sequences are then presented to PSI-BLAST to compute the profiles. Experimental results and analysis of profile-alignment score matrices suggest that both profile creation time and profile <b>alignment</b> <b>time</b> can be reduced without sacrificing subcellular localization accuracy. Once a pairwise profile-alignment score matrix has been obtained, a one-vs-rest SVM classifier can be trained. To further reduce the training and recognition time of the classifier, we propose a perturbation discriminant analysis (PDA) technique. It was found that PDA enjoys a short training time as compared to the conventional SVM.

40|$|The crystal {{alignment}} {{behavior of}} bismuth {{particles in the}} presence of an imposed static magnetic field was examined in situ by X-ray diffraction. Because the c-plane of a bismuth crystal is aligned perpendicular to the direction of a magnetic field, the temporal variation in the (110) peak intensity of bismuth was measured by X-ray diffraction to determine the crystal alignment. The <b>alignment</b> <b>time</b> decreased as the magnetic field strength increased. This tendency is similar to that calculated for the relaxation time. The difference in the magnetic susceptibility between the magnetically easy and hard axes is the driving force for the crystal alignment, and aggregation of the bismuth particles decreases this driving force. The effective difference in magnetic susceptibility for aggregated bismuth particles was estimated by measuring the <b>alignment</b> <b>time</b> of the particles under magnetic fields of various strengths. The estimated effective difference in magnetic susceptibility generally increases with a decreasing magnetic field strength. Furthermore, the interference to crystal rotation caused by the interaction between the induced current and the imposed magnetic field is negligible in this study. To decrease the strength of the magnetic field required for alignment of crystals, the number of small particles should be reduced. [doi: 10. 2320 /matertrans. MI 200719...|$|E

30|$|Computational {{performance}} (column 6) {{are related}} to a C++ implementation and run on a PC equipped with an Intel 2.4 GHz dual-core processor and 4 GB of RAM; time required for disk loading/saving of range data is excluded. It {{is important to note}} that the code has not been fully optimized for parallel execution yet, hence there is room in this sense for further improvements of time performance. Computational performance shows an average <b>alignment</b> <b>time</b> of 2.5 s. As an example, time breakdown for the Hurricane dataset is distributed as follows: 57 % for feature extraction, 1 % for feature description, 32 % for feature matching, 8 % for correspondence skim and roto-translation estimation. Lightness of our feature signature is testified by the fact that the feature description step only takes 1 % of the total time. The two main factors that influence computation times are the number of points per range image to be processed, and the number of features detected over each image. In the “worst case” (that means, images close to 1 million of points and many features detected at all scales), <b>alignment</b> <b>time</b> reached a maximum of about 4 seconds. Comparisons of computational speed with respect to the literature is somehow difficult to infer since (1) not every work declare computational speed, (2) only isolated blocks of the alignment chain are usually considered (e.g. feature extraction) instead of the entire pipeline, (3) hardware obsolescence. Nevertheless, our computational time is at least one order of magnitude (comprising hardware obsolescence compensation) under the times declared in the related works [2, 19, 20, 22].|$|E
