40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with the development and thermal design of a fast discharge system for balls for the PR 3000 MW$-{th}$ process heat reactor. The term "fast discharge system for balls" denotes a very short-time discharge procedure of the entire core contents, i. e. the flowing out of the fuel elements due to gravity into a-receiver tank underneath the prestressed-concrete vessel. From a safety-engineering point of view, the fast discharge system for balls constitutes an additional possibility of active decay heat, removal, besides the multiply redundant and diversitary reactor protection system, serving to further reduce the remaining residual risk. A fast discharge system for balls, however, is to be used only in the event of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>possibilities</b> of active decay heat removal having failed and when the maximum permissible temperatures for particularly exposed primary circuit components have been reached. However, the application range of such a system is restricted exclusively to high-temperature reactors with spherical fuel elements; the procedure cannot be applied tp-other /reactor^systems because ofthe rigidly fixed position of the fuel elements inside the core and for reasons of fuel element geometry. Besides the purpose of application, the influence of in-core temperature development on the possible actuation of the fast discharge system is being described in particular detail. This is followed by a description of the structural and thermal design of three specific major components, i. e. the piping system, shut-off devices and fuel element receiver tank, which will have to be installed additionally for the implementation of a fast discharge system for balls as compared to previous plant concepts...|$|E

She did not have any prodromal illness or vac-cination before the onset of the illness and no other white matter MRI lesions. We feel that our patient is probably a case of primary demyelinating disease, possible MS. The newly revised MRI diagnostic criteria for MS allow the diagnosis to be made after one attack, if stringent MRI criteria are met. It has been emphasized that in patients with first attack of de-myelinating disease, a diagnosis should be withheld unless new symptoms and signs or imaging abnormalities appear, more than 3 months after the onset of clinical symptoms. 6 Clinical examination fails to detect INO in 71 % and 25 % of the cases with mild and moderate INO respectively, and de-tection is improved by quantitative infrared oculography. 3 MRI is the imaging modality of choice to detect the lesions of MLF. 7 In MS patients with INO, hyperintense lesions in MLF have been demonstrated in all patients on PD sequence, in 88 % on T 2 -weighted imaging and in 44 % on FLAIR sequences. 4 In our patients the lesion in the MLF was detected only on PD coronal and FLAIR. Thus our recommendation in patients is to acquire PD sequence in addition to the other sequences in a patient with suspected INO...|$|E
40|$|The {{inspiration}} for this sculpture has gradually arisen {{from the experience}} of the previous work. I {{used to be in the}} sleeping people, in the statues of life-sized human bodies. These sculptures deformed, transformed and manipulated by various manipulations, thus getting them into unrealistic positions. These changes made it possible to see the statues, to look at their dreams. The sculptures then acted as holy scenes from the churches. The normal position of a sleeping man turned into a kind of gesture when turning. With this creation of a series of sleeping people, I cast negative shapes of castings while casting live models. Unfortunately, these negatives are one-off and are destroyed and not treated in the next process. At this time, I began to understand these negatives not only as an intermediate but also as a sculpture output that had the same function and value for me as a classic statue. Like a print, like a dream, depicting reality. This dream allows the audience to enter the figures, into their dreams. In my bachelor thesis I therefore continue to deal with human forms but in their opposite form, and I can say that I am creating a game of forms and playing with them. I did not stay with the classic forms of the bas-relief, so with the classic negative relief, but I embedded my negatives into cubes, which act as a game of cubes, which can be arranged, rotated, tossed. In my bachelor thesis I create a small group of three dice that allow this game. Cubes have only one possibility where two human characters, two human fingerprints of men and women follow. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>possibilities</b> of arranging the dice with the prints of these two figures are no longer logically unrelated - they follow unreasonably. Just as it is in dreams. In most cases, we have something logical in our dreams, such as characters and / or nature, but then it becomes always unrealistic in the dreams that we start flying. And these dice are like dreams - sometimes real, but mostly chaotic. That's why I gave my work a subtitle: "Negative Dreams" The word "negative" comes from the form of the statue I chose and the "dreams" of my idea, the inspiration I want to see for the viewer. Analyzing dreams, how they work, and how it enters our subconscious mind, I can not do it, I just create my own game inspired by dreaming into dreams. Dreams that seem to these two people in particular and which are diverse. I just built this work on my vision of looking into these dreams and how these dreams work. When the dream seems to me, it has a real background and then goes into something abnormal, unrealistic. Thanks to manipulation with dice I have the ability to change the real in unreal. I play dice with these two prints of people, the prints of their dreams. In my work, it represents the real basis of the dream arrangement of the cubes, in which the imprints of the two characters are anatomically linked. And then the dream comes and the dice regroup. The author or viewer has the ability to swap, change, and dice. Reality will change into a dream. The characters in a dream can be unnaturally linked or not at all. From one particular happening, a number of other, chaotic stories are developing. For the presentation of my bachelor thesis I chose the very "real" position where the characters follow on, they work. The cubes are built in a column to allow them to walk around and look at both figures. I photographed some other possibilities in various variants, lying, turned, sh...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{classification}} {{theory is}} developed for pairs of simple closed curves (A,B) {{in the sphere}} S 2, assuming that A∩B has finitely many components. Such a pair of simple closed curves is called an SCC-pair, and two SCC-pairs (A,B) and (A′,B′) are equivalent {{if there is a}} homeomorphism from S 2 to itself sending A to A′ and B to B′. The simple cases where A and B coincide or A and B are disjoint are easily handled. The component code is defined to provide a classification of <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>possibilities.</b> <b>The</b> component code is not uniquely determined for a given SCC-pair, but it is straightforward that it is an invariant; i. e., that if (A,B) and (A′,B′) are equivalent and C is a component code for (A,B), then C is a component code for (A′,B′) as well. It is proved that the component code is a classifying invariant in the sense that if two SCC-pairs have a component code in common, then the SCC-pairs are equivalent. Furthermore code transformations on component codes are defined so that if one component code is known for a particular SCC-pair, then all other component codes for the SCC-pair can be determined via code transformations. This provides a notion of equivalence for component codes; specifically, two component codes are equivalent if there is a code transformation mapping one to <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> <b>The</b> main result of the paper asserts that if C and C′ are component codes for SCC-pairs (A,B) and (A′,B′), respectively, then (A,B) and (A′,B′) are equivalent if and only if C and C′ are equivalent. Finally, a generalization of the Schoenflies theorem to SCC-pairs is presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{contrast}} between pre-contractual discipline at common and civil law represents, for the comparative scholar, a conceptual challenge that {{deserves to be}} harvested. Trying to formulate common principles capable of overcoming national laws, the European side seems to lean towards a cautious recognition of the binding nature of unilateral promise. Both the Draft Common Frame of Reference and the Principles of European Contract Law accept unilateral promises or undertakings as effective if they are ”intended to be legally binding without acceptance”. This feature may derive {{not only from the}} agreement between the parties but also from the mere willingness to assume a legal obligation, {{in the absence of any}} paradigm of reciprocal commitment. At first glance, an approach of this kind would seem to mark a break in continuity in civil law systems, which are focused on bilateral nature of the project of autonomy, as compared to common law systems based on the requisite of consideration. However, when looking deeper into the legal fabric developed in common law systems, one can find an instrument (promissory estoppel) which, in the course of its evolution, has progressively shown a predisposition to assume the role as an equivalent or even as a substitute to consideration. On this basis, promissory estoppel is not only the legal principle charged with the task of smoothing out the rigidity of the doctrine of consideration, but it also creates some kind of functional connection to the European culpa in contrahendo. Accordingly, the comparative analysis will be articulated at both the bargaining level and pre-contractual levels discounting that the elements of the two contexts may be largely overlapping in some cases, but not at <b>all</b> in <b>others.</b> <b>The</b> counterintuitive <b>possibility</b> of identifying the unilateral promise as a bargaining configuration (which revolves around the idea that the promisor wants to stress the seriousness of the commitment) or as an essential requirement of pre-contractual obligation (which it is closely linked to the desire to protect the expectation created in the promisee) requires some crucial theoretical articulations to be reconsidered...|$|R
