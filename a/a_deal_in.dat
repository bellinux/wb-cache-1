5|$|In 2007, Scottish actor Gerard Butler {{was close}} to signing <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>in</b> which he would play Snake Plissken in a remake of Carpenter's film. Neal Moritz was to produce and Ken Nolan was to write the {{screenplay}} which would combine an original story for Plissken with the story from the 1981 film, although Carpenter hinted that the film might be a prequel.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their new venture, Eriksen signed a global co-publishing deal with EMI Music Publishing. According to Music Week, his relationship with EMI will further the publishing company's involvement on Stargate's future projects. Prior to the deal, EMI {{has been involved with}} Hermansen's projects for nearly ten years since he signed <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>in</b> 1999. Hermansen and Eriksen will also continue their joint-venture partnership, Stellar Songs, with EMI.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Fox {{announced}} that, due {{to financial}} difficulties, {{they were unable}} to continue to produce The Simpsons under its current contract and that unless there were pay cuts, the show could end. For the negotiations, the studio requested that the cast members accept a 45% cut of their salaries so that more seasons could be produced after season 23, or else that season would be the last. In the end, the studio and the actors reached <b>a</b> <b>deal,</b> <b>in</b> which the actors would take a pay cut of 30%, down to just over $300,000 per episode, prolonging the show to its 25th season. As well as the actors, everybody involved in the show took a pay cut.|$|E

5|$|The Nazi {{government}} quickly negotiated <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>in</b> {{which the}} Swiss burned the Bf 110under {{the supervision of}} German observers {{in return for a}} sale to the Swiss of 12new Bf 109G-6 Gustav to replace combat losses. The new fighters were delivered in batches of six on 20and 22May. The new planes had serious manufacturing defects from the poor workmanship and production disruptions caused by Allied bombings, and after complaints the Germans refunded half of the six million Swiss franc purchase price.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 2014, {{there was}} {{increasing}} {{speculation that the}} Sōryū class (or a derivative) was the most likely candidate for the replacement. Defence technology sharing deals between Japan and Australia, along with the loosening of Japanese defence export restrictions, were seen as preliminary steps towards such a deal. The close personal relationship between the then-Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe was also cited {{as a factor in}} the likeliness of such <b>a</b> <b>deal.</b> <b>In</b> response to the rumours of the Japanese deal, unsolicited proposals were made by ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (its Type 216 submarine concept), Saab (an enlarged version of the A26 submarine), and Thales and DCNS (a diesel-electric variant of the Barracuda-class submarine).|$|E
5|$|White's {{ability to}} attract new writers {{suffered}} because of the low rates he paid: one cent per word, as compared to three or five cents per word at the leading competitive magazines. To compensate, White cultivated new writers whose experimental work was not selling elsewhere. White made <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>in</b> 1971 with Gordon Eklund, who was hesitating to become a full-time writer because of the financial risks. White agreed to buy anything Eklund wrote, on condition that Eklund himself believed {{it was a good}} story. The result was that much of Eklund's fiction appeared in Amazing and Fantastic over the next few years.|$|E

5|$|After year-long {{expectations}} that the ninth season {{would be the}} series' last, NBC signed <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>in</b> late December 2002 to bring the series back for a final tenth season. The series' creative team {{did not want to}} extend negotiations into the next year, and wanted to start writing the rest of the ninth-season episodes and a potential series finale. NBC agreed to pay $10million to Warner Bros. for the production of each tenth-season episode, the highest price in television history for a 30-minute series. Although NBC was unable to bring in enough advertising revenue from commercials to cover the costs, the series was integral to the Thursday night schedule, which brought high ratings and profits to the other television series. The cast demanded that the tenth season be reduced from the usual 24 episodes to 18 episodes to allow them to work on outside projects.|$|E
5|$|An enquiry {{was held}} to resolve the {{question}} of whom should inherit the de Eynsford lands; Eynsford Castle and the other family estates were divided equally between William Heringaud, a powerful landowner in east Kent, and Nicholas de Criol, a smaller local Kentish landowner, {{both of whom were}} descended from William V. The Second Barons' War broke out in 1264 and both men supported the rebels against Henry III. Eynsford, by now unoccupied, was seized by Ralph de Farningham, a royal official, who in turn passed it onto Ralph de Sandwich, a royal judge. De Sandwich squeezed the Heringauds out of their inheritance, making <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>in</b> 1292 with Heringaud's daughter, the lady of Horton Kirby, and de Sandwich and the Criols then became joint owners of the castle. Around 1300, the castle was occupied once again, probably either by the widow of Nicholas or William VI, or a castle bailiff.|$|E
5|$|Before doing so, Marty travels up to Travers' {{house to}} try to {{convince}} Travers to allow him to keep Shiloh. Judd does not see Marty approaching, and shoots a doe out of season, which would mean a stiff fine Judd cannot afford. Marty lets Judd know he knows, and attempts to blackmail him out of Shiloh. Judd and Marty eventually negotiate <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>in</b> which Marty will earn Shiloh for 40 dollars, paid with 20 hours of working for Judd. At {{the end of the first}} week, Judd says that he will not keep his end of the deal because the evidence of the dead doe has with the passage of time disappeared. Second, the contract that Marty had him sign is worthless in the state of West Virginia without the signature of a witness. Despite Judd's pointed disapproval of his work, Marty continues to work for him. They begin discussing dogs and Judd's father who began physically abusing Judd when he was four years old. In the end, Judd warms to Marty, relents, and lets him keep Shiloh.|$|E

5|$|For the negotiations, {{the studio}} {{requested}} that the cast members accept a 45 percent cut of their salaries so that more seasons could be produced after season 23, or else that season would be the series' last. The actors {{were willing to take}} a pay cut, but wanted a percentage of the back-end payments instead. At one point Shearer even offered a 70 percent pay cut in exchange for back-end percentages, but the studio was unwilling to make any deal involving back-end percentages. In the end, the studio and the actors reached <b>a</b> <b>deal,</b> <b>in</b> which the actors would take a pay cut of 30 percent, down to just over $300,000 per episode, prolonging the show to its 25th season. As well as the voice actors, everybody involved in the show took a pay cut. This included animators, writers, the post-production crew and even Jean himself. The further use of digital animation also saves money, as the animation of the show becomes more efficient.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, he {{was signed}} by the Peanut Eaters of the Pennsylvania State Association, and played in 36games before being sold to the Detroit Wolverines of the NL, along with Ed Beatin for $1,000 on July27. Soon, the deal was put on hold by the NL, as the Cincinnati Red Stockings of the American Association(AA) also claimed they had <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>in</b> place for these players. On September6, an {{arbitration}} board for the NL and AA leagues convened to render their findings. They found that Detroit's contract with the players was dated on July20, which superseded Cincinnati's contract that was signed on July27, and awarded Detroit the players. Detroit then sold their contracts with the players to the London Tecumsehs of the International Association. Though he did not play for London in 1887, he did play in two games for the New York Metropolitans of the AA, going hitless in eight at bats.|$|E
5|$|Intended to be Galveston follow-up, Pizzolatto felt True Detective {{was more}} {{suitable}} on-screen once the project took definite form. Pizzolatto shopped the novel to two TV executives, and, once he secured <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>in</b> May 2010, drafted six screenplays, including the pilot episode script for True Detective, which ran 90 pages. He devoted another script {{for the series}} shortly after his departure from The Killings writing staff in 2011, thanks to the support of Anonymous Content. The final copy, amounting to 500 pages, was written {{without the aid of}} a writing staff. By this time, Pizzolatto secured a development deal with HBO, and by April 2012, the network commissioned True Detective on an order of eight episodes. Set up as an anthology series, each season will feature a different cast of characters and self-contained narratives in various time periods and locations.|$|E

5|$|Nichols and Cooper {{came to an}} {{agreement}} about the Solway Bridge. Although it was in Knox County, Anderson County had contributed $27,000 towards its construction. It was still paying off the bonds, but now the bridge was usable only by CEW workers. Nichols negotiated <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>in</b> which Knox County was paid $25,000 annually for the bridge, of which $6,000 was {{to be used to}} maintain the access road. Judge Thomas L. Seeber then threatened to close the Edgemoor Bridge unless Anderson County was similarly compensated. An agreement was reached under which Anderson County received $10,000 for the bridge and $200 per month. Knox County did not keep its side of the bargain to maintain the road, which was damaged by heavy traffic and became impassable after torrential rains in 1944. The Army was forced to spend $5,000 per month on road works in Knox County.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, the Phillies named Rubén Amaro, Jr. to be {{the general}} manager after Pat Gillick retired {{at the end of}} a three-year contract.

Gillick remained with the Phillies as an advisor. On November 13, Sam Perlozzo joined the Phillies as third base coach and fielding/infield coach after spending the 2008 season in the same position for the Seattle Mariners. Perlozzo previously served as the third base coach for the New York Mets, the Cincinnati Reds, and as third base coach, bench coach, and manager for the Baltimore Orioles. Another former manager, Pete Mackanin, was named the team's new bench coach on November 21; he had been interim manager for the Reds when Jerry Narron was fired in Cincinnati in 2007.

On December 16, Raúl Ibañez agreed to play left field for the Phillies in a 3-year, $31.5 million deal. South Korean pitcher Chan Ho Park officially signed a one-year contract to join the Phillies on January 6, after agreeing to <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> <b>in</b> principle in December. Park was originally signed as an insurance policy for the bullpen, as reliever J. C.
