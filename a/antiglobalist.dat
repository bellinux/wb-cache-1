50|$|During the Sixties and Seventies, at {{the same}} time as Grotowski's work, the {{movement}} of social and politically engaged theatre was also developing in Poland. At first, it was, above all, a rebellious student theatre, later, during the period of martial law, the movement also accepted professionals, who organised productions for the underground Home Theatre. One specific form of political rebellion through theatre was promoted by Wrocław's Orange Alternative, an informal group which organised mass events poking fun at the symbols and ceremonies of officialdom. After the regaining of sovereignty in 1989, this movement weakened, but recently it has been reborn as an anticapitalist and antiwar movement. The most important centre for this kind of activity is Poznań, where, alongside the once famous and still active Theatre of the Eighth Day (the <b>antiglobalist</b> production Summit), the Travel Agency Theatre operates. One of its most important achievements is the open-air production Carmen Funebre, created under the influence of events in the former Yugoslavia and shown all over the world.|$|E
40|$|<b>Antiglobalist</b> {{forces have}} been gaining greater {{momentum}} {{in recent years in}} their efforts to reverse what they view as the negative effects of an integrating global economy. Their influence wasfelt earlier when efforts to create a Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) ended in failure in 1998 after France left the bargaining table at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, effectively killing the initiative. * In this book, through an evaluation of the MAI itself and the issues raised by its opponents, Edward M. Graham takes a fresh look atthe growing backlash against globalization. He first explores whether the MAI negotiations failed due to political maneuvering by <b>antiglobalist</b> nongovernmental organizations (supported by US organized labor) or because of irreconcilable differences among the negotiating parties over the substance of the issue of foreign direct investment. He then objectively and thoroughly assesses <b>antiglobalist</b> assertions that the activities of multinational firms have had negative effects on workers both in the home (investor) and host (recipient) nations, with a special focus on developing nations. An important finding is that multinational firms tend to pay workers in developing nations wages that are significantly above prevailing wages. Graham then examines the issue of globalized economic activity and the environment, finding that economic growth in developing nations can lead to increased environmental stress but also finding that foreign direct investment can lead to reductions in this stress. He finds that the worry of many environmentalists of a "race to the bottom" is not borne out by the evidence. * The final chapters assess whether or not a negotiation to create a comprehensive agreement on investment should be included in a multilateral negotiating round at the World Trade Organization in the near future. The interests of developing nations in this agenda are given special attention. Graham indicates that, while many developing nations would accept such rules, it might nonetheless be premature to press for a comprehensive agreement at this time. Rather, a limited investment agenda might be both more feasible and more productive. ...|$|E

These initiatives receive extensive media coverage because most originate from a critical perspective fueled by anti–mass-consumption movements such as the <b>antiglobalist,</b> environmental, or social justice movements. They are generally presented in opposition to industrial food systems. But I would argue that the industrial and alternative systems in fact support each other ( [...] .) ...|$|E

50|$|Although {{they may}} not {{recognize}} themselves as <b>antiglobalists</b> and are pro-capitalism, some economists who don't share the neoliberal approach of international economic institutions have strongly influenced the movement. Amartya Sen's Development as Freedom (Nobel Prize in Economics, 1999), argues that third world development must be understood as the expansion of human capability, not simply the increase in national income per capita, and thus requires policies attuned to health and education, not simply GDP. James Tobin's (winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics) proposal for a tax on financial transactions (called, after him, the Tobin tax) {{has become part of}} the agenda of the movement. Also, George Soros, Joseph E. Stiglitz (another Economic Sciences Nobel prize winner, formerly of the World Bank, author of Globalization and Its Discontents) and David Korten have made arguments for drastically improving transparency, for debt relief, land reform, and restructuring corporate accountability systems. Korten and Stiglitz's contribution to the movement include involvement in direct actions and street protest.|$|R
40|$|Globalisation is {{a highly}} {{controversial}} topic. Despite its potential for accelerating growth and reducing poverty (to which most policy makers and economist would agree) objections are often expressed about the position of developing countries, {{and a number of}} damaging side-effects of the current globalisation wave. In the present analysis, a number of questions raised by the <b>antiglobalist</b> movement is assessed on its economic merits. On the basis of empirical analyses, it is assessed whether: - the poor benefit proportionally from globalisation; - the position of primary producers in the global economy has indeed eroded; - current global trade architecture promotes unilateral liberalisation in developing countries; - globalisation increases the scope for abuse by multinational corporations; - financial integration increases the risk of financial instability. ...|$|E
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the concept of}} terrorism {{in the age of}} globalization. Terrorism, which has been motivated by ideological, religious and national reasons, has added to its concern issues like inequality, injustice, dissatisfaction and <b>antiglobalist</b> movements, due to development and technology in the world. In order to clarify this shift in the policy, the concepts of terrorism and globalization are first explained as distinct issues. Terrorism has been globalized because of modernization, developments in technology, communication and the ease in transportation. Thus, globalization has started to serve terrorism, while with its positive effects it became helpful in the fight against terrorism. The connection of globalization to terrorism has been explained in this respect. As the previous tools of diplomacy and military measures started to lose their validity, international cooperation and law have emerged as the tool to fight against terrorism. Since terrorism is a phenomenon that cannot be totally abolished, the best way to minimize terrorism is the use of international law, with necessary organizations established to form a cooperation at the international level.

40|$|Among {{the central}} tenets of {{globalization}} is the free migration of labor. Although {{much has been}} written about the benefits of globalization, little is known about its limitations and how <b>antiglobalist</b> sentiment can be strongly affected by high levels of immigration. Analyzing poll data from a group of EU countries affected by the recent migrant crisis, we find that over the last three years the percentage of right-wing (RW) populist voters in a given country depends on the prevalence of immigrants in this country’s population and the total immigration inflow into the entire EU. The latter is likely due to the perception that the EU functions as a supranational state in which a lack of inner borders means that “someone else’s problem” can easily become “my problem. ” We find that the increase in the percentage of RW voters substantially surpasses the percentage of immigration inflow, implying that if this process continues, ongoing democratic processes will cause RW populism to prevail and globalization to rapidly decrease. We locate tipping points between the fraction of immigrants and the rise of RW populism, and we model our empirical findings using a complex network framework in which the success of globalization rests on a balance between immigration and immigrant integration...|$|E
40|$|THEME: Internationalism: Worlds at Play Abstract Public Diplomacy and Virtual Worlds An {{examination}} {{of the role of}} Massively Multiplayer Online Games as an extension of and venue for cultural dialogue, exchange and identity. Background Over the past decade, communications technologies have evolved more rapidly than has our ability to understand them. Since the early 1990 s, we have witnessed a communication revolution, fueled by advances in computer technology, mobile and wireless communication, new information communication technologies, the expansion of broadcast through cable television and most significantly, the Internet. One element of this transformation has been the emergence of "many-to-many" networks, communication networks that allow large numbers of users to communicate with each other, without interference from gatekeepers, regulators or editorial influence. The global information culture is fundamentally shifting from a broadcast environment to a topology where broadcast amplifies, and is amplified by, many-to-many networks that are increasingly enabled by information technologies – including web services, publicly accessible databases, social software (weblogs, wikis, buddy lists, online games, file-sharing networks), mobile devices (camera phones, text messaging, global positioning systems), and the tools and technologies that blur the line between online and real-world spaces (web cams, wi-fi, distributed sensors, Internet cafes, MeetUp and other smart-mob phenomena). This transformation of the global information culture has deep and fundamental implications for politics and public diplomacy – dampening (or reversing) the effectiveness of traditional public diplomacy campaigns while opening up new opportunities that are not on the radar of public affairs people doing "business as usual. " For example, relationships formed in the virtual gaming world transcend traditional geopolitical and geosocial boundaries; weblogs {{played a key role in}} the last Korean election, and text messages sparked rallies during the recent Spanish elections. Radical movements of every political stripe, from left-wing <b>antiglobalists</b> to religious fundamentalists (Christian, Muslim, Hindu), are fully conversant with the dynamics of these technologies, while their governments are not. The bureaucratic obesity of national governments, often precludes awareness of, much less a well informed response to, these emergent phenomena as they happen. These changes present new research challenges, as well as new opportunities for developing projects with long-term, real world social impact. The Study We are attempting to understand the relationships between many-to-many technologies – networked interaction on a mass scale – and public diplomacy. Our goal in this essay will be to describe how massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) or "virtual worlds" can facilitate intercultural dialogue among various groups. What is Public Diplomacy? Traditional definitions of public diplomacy include government-sponsored cultural, educational and informational programs, citizen exchanges and broadcasts used to promote the national interest of a country through understanding, informing, and influencing foreign audiences. We view the field much more broadly. In addition to government sponsored programs, we are equally concerned with aspects of what Joseph Nye has labeled "soft power. " The impact of private activities - from popular culture to fashion to sports to news to the Internet - that inevitably, if not purposefully, have an impact on foreign policy and national security as well as on trade, tourism and other national interests. Why Virtual Worlds? Virtual worlds, mainly constructed through massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs), function as communication networks in three different ways: • As one-to-many networks (developer to community). Virtual worlds, in other words, are created by a team of developers and include assumptions, values and beliefs in the structure, design, and art of the game. • As many-to-many networks. Virtual worlds are networked communication systems, which allow for interactive chat, internal email, and private and public messaging. Communication can occur among and between any of the online participants in a multitude of configurations. • As one-to-many networks (player to community). Virtual worlds also offer individual players increasing access to a new form of "broadcast. " from things as basic as avatar appearance and selection to the ability to create and display objects or messages in public forums or virtual space. Each of these spaces provides us with research questions that can help us to better understand the role of virtual worlds in public diplomacy. Early research has confirmed that within these spaces, there is a unique opportunity to create, foster and sustain intercultural dialogue and that perception of national values, ideals, and character are both reinforced and altered by the real time interactions that occur in these spaces. Understanding Virtual Worlds • Cross Cultural Comparison. Our report will highlight representative examples of games produced in different countries (for example, United States, Korea, Finland, and England) with varied themes and designs in order to explore both the manner in which notions of nation, cultural values, and citizenship are reflected, integrated and assumed within the content of those games as well as the degree to which those representations are positive, negative or neutral. In doing so, we will ask three fundamental questions: 1. How does game content reflect issues of national identity and cultural values both of the producers and of the players? 2. In what ways are players encouraged or discouraged from engaging in intercultural dialogue and what opportunities exist for such dialogue? 3. What means do players have to reflect national identity or specific cultural values (private chat, avatar appearance and naming, object creation and placement) and how frequently do they engage in such opportunities? • Categorization. The answers to these questions (types and uses or networks, types of game design, and cultural content) provide us with extremely rich data to describe, measure, and access each MMOG’s facilitation of intercultural dialogue (from low to high effectiveness) within the three domains of design, content, and network. Those analyses, in turn, serve as the foundation for a typology that will provide categorical profiles of MMOGs according to combinations of the relative strengths and weakness in each of those domains with regards to fostering various forms of cultural dialogue. We will seek to identify nascent and novel manifestation of such dialogue. The typology overall and the categories elaborated within will offer a wide variety of useful tools to public diplomacy practitioners who are seeking to facilitate productive intercultural exchange during this time of intensifying globalization and technological change...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 104 - 110). This thesis analyzes {{an important}} Brazilian Social Movement called the "Landless Rural Workers Movement" or "MST" {{that has emerged}} in the early 80 's following an already existent history of Brazilian Social Movements struggling against the injustice of land concentration in Brazilian rural areas. The MST has surpassed the role of being just an anti-capitalist, <b>antiglobalist</b> or revolutionary movement, to become a massive popular movement that has dominated its space, set its principles and assimilated its role in society in a national and international sphere. The thesis has a twofold purpose: on one hand it examines the MST struggle for land {{and on the other}} hand, it explores the existence of a government that does not abide by its obligation and fulfils its role in what has already been conceded in its constitution in regards to the question of land reform in Brazil. The corrupt political system in Brazil has proven to the movement that only the governance of a radical regime would serve their interest and finally implement a just and viable agrarian reform. Thus, the highlight {{of this study is to}} explore the present Brazilian government under President Lula, whose background and leftist ideologies had disillusioned the MST's expectations and hopes with his neoliberal and market oriented policies. Accordingly this thesis will discuss the Brazilian history and political system in order to better understand the political trap and disillusionment of the MST and other social movements. 1 bound copy: vi, 110 leaves; 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to chart how {{globalization}} is changing the sense of justice of the publics it affects. Globalization transforms our social environment. By deterritorializing the interactions between individuals, private and public organizations, it complicates the life of existing communities (states) but also calls into being a new community. David Hume taught that justice applies within a cooperative scheme. This cooperative scheme is becoming global rather than domestic. Rather than international, it is becoming transnational. The consequence of globalization is that the subjects of one state increasingly and as a matter of course apply to the subjects of another state an idea of justice that formerly applied only within the domestic context. This fundamental transformation in political consciousness is already becoming manifest in the form of the alterglobalist (rather than <b>antiglobalist)</b> social movement. Where alterglobalism springs up as a common response to the unintended consequences of globalization, globalization in effect fashions a community in the sense meant by John Dewey. Not yet well established, this community is under threat both from particularist fundamentalism (Islamic jihad) and from the reimposition of state power (under the banner of “War against Terror”). Nevertheless, the primary reaction of the public around the world to the events of 11 September 2001 has been an outpouring of sympathy that accords with the hypothesis of an emerging global community of justice. The geographical extent of the reaction shows the reach of the global cooperative scheme. The intensity of participation on the side of the victims shows the force of the global community for justice. ...|$|E
