5|$|Louisville {{returned}} on offense, {{needing to}} score quickly, make {{a stop on}} defense, then score a second {{time to take the}} lead. The energized Tech defense was disinclined to allow any such thing. Though Cantwell completed two short passes for 16yards and a first down, he was sacked on first down and the Tech defense prevented him from completing another pass. Two passes were knocked down by Hokie defenders, while another fell short. After Louisville failed to convert a fourth down, Virginia Tech took over on offense. The Hokies proceeded to run out the clock, executing two short rushes and an incomplete pass. Louisville had one final chance on offense after a Tech punt, but three consecutive desperation Hail Mary passes were unsuccessful. Two fell incomplete, and the third was intercepted by Tech cornerback Brandon Flowers. With time <b>almost</b> <b>gone,</b> Tech finished running out the clock and secured the victory. As time expired, Virginia Tech held a 35â€“24 lead and won the 2006 Gator Bowl.|$|E
25|$|Then, {{after being}} dismissed, the future Hall of Fame manager defended {{himself in a}} press conference, arguing that the club was badly organised, for having players that never played {{together}} before. Anderson added that to improve the team, the owners should strengthen the relationship between players and coaches, not make any difference. Also, {{they gave me a}} group of local veteran players <b>almost</b> <b>gone</b> from baseball, and rookies with little professional experience, he explained earnestly.|$|E
25|$|After {{the club}} had <b>almost</b> <b>gone</b> bust, its board {{restructured}} it {{and began to}} work at a slow, but steady reconstruction. In 2004, the city of Magdeburg resolved to build a new stadium, which meant that 1. FC Magdeburg had to move to the much smaller Heinrich Germer Stadium. The patient rebuilding of the squad paid off eventually, when the club was re-promoted to Regionalliga Nord in 2006. Additionally, Magdeburg won the Saxony-Anhalt-Cup for a sixth time.|$|E

500|$|Referring to {{the fate}} of the 1987 LPs, Drummond sings [...] "Build a fire, stoke it good, throw them on, and watch the bastards burn", {{accompanied}} by a stark, ring modulated chorus, [...] "Mu Mu!".

500|$|In {{one of the}} few {{contemporaneous}} accounts, the Toledo Blade {{wrote that}} the Penn players, knowing that Schulz was [...] "the power in the Michigan game", focused their energy on wearing him down. [...] There were two Penn players who [...] "did nothing but look after Schultz". [...] And they did more than look: [...] "In every scrimmage, he was bumped as hard as the rules allowed, and maybe a little harder, when nobody was looking.... Every time Schultz started anywhere he would find a couple of Penn men digging headfirst into his stomach. [...] They would elbow him, jam him with the straight arm, and if he went to the ground in a scrimmage there generally would be a knee grinding him in the wind. [...] Pretty soon Schultz began to show it.... He limped along pitifully. [...] He couldn't run. [...] His strength was <b>almost</b> <b>gone.</b> [...] When he did tackle, his groan of pain could almost be heard in the stands". [...] But the fans continued to urge Schulz with yells of [...] "G-r-r-r-r-rah, Schultz!" [...] Schulz buckled down and continued to play, and the pummeling continued.|$|E
500|$|Of all the 2nd Battalion units, G Company {{received}} the hardest blows. Before dawn of September 1, North Korean troops had G Company platoons on separate hills under heavy assault. Shortly after 03:00 they overran the 3rd Platoon, Heavy Mortar Company, and drove {{it from its}} position. These mortarmen climbed Hill 179 and on its crest joined the 2nd Platoon of G Company. Meanwhile, the 3rd Platoon of G Company, on a low hill along the Nam River [...] from its juncture with the Naktong River, was also under close quarters attack. After daylight, Captain LeRoy E. Majeske, G Company commander, requested artillery concentrations and air strikes, but they were slow to come. At 11:45, the North Koreans had almost reached {{the crest of the}} hill, and only a narrow space separated the two forces. A few minutes later Majeske was killed, and Second Lieutenant George Roach, commanding the 3rd Platoon, again reported the situation and asked for an air strike. The US Air Force delivered the strike on the North Korean held side of the hill, and this checked the assaults. By this time many North Korean troops had captured and occupied foxholes in the platoon position and from there threw grenades into other parts of the position. One of the grenades killed Roach early in the afternoon. Sergeant First Class Junius Poovey, a squad leader, now assumed command. By 18:00, Poovey had only 12 effective troops left in the platoon, 17 of the 29 men still living were wounded. With ammunition <b>almost</b> <b>gone,</b> Poovey requested and received authority to withdraw into the main G Company position. After dark, the 29 men, three of them carried on stretchers, withdrew, covered by the arrival of US tanks. The group reached the G Company position on Hill 179 at 23:30.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the river}} {{approaches}} the sea, the north bank (Roker) has a substantial residential development and marina. [...] A dolphin nicknamed Freddie {{was a frequent}} visitor to the marina, attracting much local publicity. [...] However, concern was expressed that acclimatising the dolphin to human presence might put at risk {{the safety of the}} dolphin regarding the propellors of marine craft. The south bank of the river is occupied by what remains of the Port of Sunderland, once thriving and now <b>almost</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{economic}} impact of the strike began to be felt immediately. [...] Layoffs in a number of steel-dependent industries occurred just two days after the strike began. National defense mobilization authorities began denying manufacturers of consumer goods steel four days after the strike started, and banned the export of steel on June 10. By June 17, defense plants producing the M47 Patton tank, the M41 Walker Bulldog tank, trucks, bazooka rockets and mortar shells had all shut down or were running half- or quarter-shifts. By June 21, consumer inventories of steel were <b>almost</b> <b>gone,</b> forcing manufacturing shut-downs in the auto industry. As the Independence Day holiday neared, most inventories of steel were gone even from defense stockpiles.|$|E
2500|$|His second {{tour of duty}} with AATTV in Vietnam {{commenced}} in July 1964, {{after being}} promoted to warrant officer class II. During his second tour, {{he was awarded the}} Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions when a patrol was ambushed at Tako on 16 September. Simpson, although severely wounded in the leg, held off the enemy while he called for assistance by radio. He and his men repelled several enemy assaults until help arrived, and none too soon as their ammunition was <b>almost</b> <b>gone</b> and Simpson was weak from loss of blood. [...] He was evacuated by helicopter to the 6th Field Hospital at Nha Trang and later convalesced in Tokyo. On return to Australia, he was posted to the 1st Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment (Commando) in Sydney in January 1966.|$|E

2500|$|Not {{qualified}} for County Championship matches in 1905 or 1906, Montgomery's only match for Somerset in 1905 was the {{game against the}} Australian team at Bath, a mstch in which his former Surrey colleague, Tom Richardson, made his only appearance for Somerset. By {{the time he was}} qualified to play regularly in 1907, his bowling was <b>almost</b> <b>gone</b> and he took just three wickets in nine games, all of them in a single innings against the South Africans in his very last first-class game. His batting failed to compensate for the lack of wickets: he had his best ever season with the bat, averaging 10.12 and against Warwickshire at Bath he scored exactly 50, the only time in his first-class career that he reached this milestone. He did not play for Somerset after this 1907 season.|$|E
2500|$|For 1981, the Spirit sedan-based VAM Gremlin saw the {{greatest}} changes since 1979. Both versions obtained a 55-amp alternator, coolant recovery tank and fan shroud regardless of trim level or {{the presence of}} the air conditioning system, as well as a new shared grille design with vertical bars and a single horizontal one in the bottom plus a shared new seat pattern design. For the first time, door panels completely covered all previously exposed metal parts. International symbols appeared in the instrument cluster warning lights and the light beam switch was integrated to the steering column marker light lever. The Gremlin X received numerous updates. All chromed items were deleted other than the front end and rear licence plate light housings while the rear spoiler passed on to the option list. Both bumpers changed to blacked out units. Side decals were <b>almost</b> <b>gone,</b> with only a small [...] "Gremlin X" [...] one at the bottom corner of each C-pillar. A new leather-wrapped sports steering wheel with six simulated hex socket bolts on the horn button was used. A four speed manual transmission with Hurst linkage and a 3.07:1 rear gear ratio became standard. Units with automatic transmission retained the 3.31:1 rear gear ratio of all previous years. The optional equipment list now included eight-spoke sports-style steel wheels using the same volcano hubcaps as the standard wheels.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{before the}} ITF had {{announced}} their bonus, the Grand Slam controversy {{had taken on}} a life of its own. [...] Writing in 1982, Neil Amdur claimed, [...] "Now the sport spins nervously under the influence of big dollars and even bigger egos, and tradition has <b>almost</b> <b>gone</b> the way of white balls and long flannels [...] If the four major tournaments want to offer a $1 million incentive for any player in the future who can sweep their titlesâ€”and such talks have been rumoredâ€”that bonus would be a welcome addition. But changing what the Grand Slam is all about is like a baseball player believing that he 'hit for the cycle' after slugging a single, double and triple in the first game of a doubleheader and a home run in his first time at bat in the second game." [...] Despite seeming clarity from the ITF, some journalists suggested that the sport's organizing body had turned its back on history and changed the [...] "rules" [...] of tennis by redefining a Grand Slam. [...] Such confusion continued for years. [...] For instance, when Steffi Graf completed the Grand Slam in 1988, George Vecsey wrote, [...] "Even the International Tennis Federation, which should have more respect for history, ruled in 1982 that winning any four straight majors constituted a Grand Slamâ€”and offered a $1 million bonus for it [...] But many tennis people, and most writers, and probably most fans, too, did not accept the new rules, and the I.T.F. has dropped the gimmick." [...] Vecsey was only half right: the ITF dropped the [...] "gimmick" [...] of the cash bonus, but it had never changed any rules.|$|E
