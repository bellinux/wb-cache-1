5000|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, nearly all the ships of the East Asia Station were dispersed at various island colonies on routine missions; the armored cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were at anchor at Ponape in the Carolines. The fleet then rendezvoused at Pagan Island in the northern Marianas - the commanders planning the logistics of their long journey to Germany, with the ships coaling. The light cruiser Nürnberg was dispatched to Honolulu in the United States Territory of Hawaii to gather war news since all German undersea cables through British controlled areas were cut.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} diverse {{approaches to}} human subjectivity conceptualization. On the one hand, a summary {{is made of}} an established psychological view of personality as an intrinsic psychological entity responsible for stylistic differences {{in the behavior of}} isolated individuals, founded on the traditional Cartesian view. On the other hand more recent views are presented, which take human subjectivity as personhood i. e. responsible action of moral subjects, placed within amongst-people space, and implying <b>allied</b> <b>activity</b> of persons in a social community. In addition, consideration is given to new methodological demands for psychologists who want to research the domain of human personhood as well as to deviations of a "new paradigm" of psychological investigations from scientific tradition in viewing methods that has prevailed in psychology until recently. Clarification of demands for studying personhood is a new trend in psychology, so it should be stressed that such orientation, despite its long-lasting past, virtually has a very short history...|$|E

40|$|The {{social and}} {{economic}} scenario {{of the country has}} changed considerably during the period 1951 to till date. The eastern states of India are burdened population with limited resources. A total of twenty six socio economic indicators comprising of various characteristics of education, agricultural & allied activities, urbanization, electrification, economic prosperity and modernization were examined for classifying the socio-economic status of the states in eastern region of India. The secondary data on these variables were collected from various sources. The variables were normalized to give zero mean and unit variance. The indices of various characteristics of the states as well as over all status of the states have been determined. It was observed that the states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand are poor in education, agricultural and <b>allied</b> <b>activity</b> development, Urbanization, electrification and modernization. However, West Bengal is at better position in comparison to the other states of the eastern region of India. The education and modernization of Assam is considerably good.

40|$|The authors {{contribute}} to the developing literature on call centres by providing detailed empirical evidence on the spatial unevenness {{in the distribution of}} call centre activity. They argue that the driving forces of call centre growth, whether as the rationalisation of back-office functions or as entirely new entities, have been corporate strategy and the pursuit of low-cost competitive advantage. Thus, although technological developments at the heart of call centre operations render them relatively 'footloose' in locational terms, the search for specific characteristics makes certain regions (and parts of regions) more attractive than others. By using a sample database of call centres, the authors describe the characteristics of call centres in the United Kingdom in terms of size, sector, and spatial distribution. They then attempt to explain the determinants of call centre location at the county level through a multiple regression analysis. The results indicate that there is a propensity to site call centres close to existing concentrations of <b>allied</b> <b>activity,</b> with preferences for densely populated areas mediated by needs to maintain employee access and avoid staff turnover problems. This has important implications for the spatial division of labour, with call centre growth likely to reinforce existing spatial unevenness in employment in key service activities. The authors conclude by considering the implications of these findings for contemporary urban and regional development, as well as providing a number of suggestions for future research. ...|$|E
