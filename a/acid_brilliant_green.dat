40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Green</b> on {{motility}} was studied with Salmonella anatum, S. derby, S. tennessee, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Semisolid tryptic soy-agars containing 0, 20, or 40 mg of <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Green</b> per liter {{were used as}} the motility media. Both concentrations of <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Green</b> inhibited {{the growth of the}} non-Salmonella species through the semisolid agar. For 24 hr, the <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Green</b> appeared to limit the growth of the salmonellae; however, by 48 hr the salmonellae were able to grow through the semisolid agars. The presence of <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Green</b> in the motility media aided in the detection of Salmonella when mixed cultures were used...|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{inhibitory}} effect of 24 different combinations of <b>brilliant</b> <b>green</b> and bile salts concentrations was conducted, using seven species of microorganisms capable of fermenting mannitol. The inhibitory effect of <b>brilliant</b> <b>green</b> decreased as the bile salts concentration was increased. Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus rettgeri were inhibited by all test media. Escherichia coli was inhibited in all but two combinations of <b>brilliant</b> <b>green</b> and bile salts. Aerobacter aerogenes generally followed a pattern of growth {{similar to that of}} three species of salmonellae. Three of the 24 combinations of <b>brilliant</b> <b>green</b> and bile salts showed little or no inhibition of salmonellae but did inhibit the other organisms studied...|$|R
40|$|Patch {{tests in}} 215 {{patients}} having contact dermatitis due to local antibacterial agents, revealed 18 patients having positive patch tests with 1 % aqueous <b>brilliant</b> <b>green</b> and one patient with 1 % aqueous gentian violet. Twelve {{of the patients}} having positive patch tests with <b>brilliant</b> <b>green</b> were tested again with increasing dilutions of <b>brilliant</b> <b>green</b> to ascertain the titre of contact hypersensitivity (TCH), i. c. the highest dilution or the lowes I t concentration of <b>brilliant</b> <b>green</b> giving a positive patch test in the patient. The vaule of TCH differed widely in different patients, the lowest concentration giving a positive patch test being 0. 62 % in two patients.

40|$|The plating {{efficiency}} of Salmonella anatum, S. cubana, S. dublin, S. tennessee, and S. typhimurium was determined for eight lots of <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Green</b> Agar made by two manufacturers. Washed cells {{were used as}} the inoculum and cultures were incubated at 41. 5 C. All lots of <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Green</b> Agar were supplemented with 12 mg of sulfadiazine per 100 ml of medium. Of the eight lots of <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Green</b> Agar tested, average recovery of the test salmonellae in three {{did not differ from}} recoveries with Trypticase Soy Agar, which was used as a control to indicate the number of viable salmonellae in the test suspension capable of growth on a nonselective medium. Two lots of <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Green</b> Agar gave salmonellae recoveries with geometric means about 25 % lower than, and significantly different from, those of the control agar.

30|$|A new {{and simple}} method for the {{determination}} of trace amounts of <b>brilliant</b> <b>green</b> was developed by coacervative extraction and spectrophotometry. The method {{is based on the}} extraction of <b>brilliant</b> <b>green</b> with coacervates made up of sodium dodecyl sulfate as an anionic surfactant, in the presence of saturated NaCl solution. The effect of various experimental parameters such as pH of solutions, concentration of surfactant and concentration of salt was investigated using central composite design based on response surface methodology. Under the optimum conditions the calibration graph was linear in the range of 0.03 – 2.2  µg mL− 1 with a detection limit of 0.012  µg mL− 1. The relative standard deviation for seven replicates of 1.2  µg mL− 1 <b>brilliant</b> <b>green</b> was 1.75 %. The proposed method was successfully applied for {{the determination of}} <b>brilliant</b> <b>green</b> in different real samples including fish farming water, river water and tap water samples.|$|R

40|$|Antimicrobial {{activity}} of <b>brilliant</b> <b>green</b> dye in Trypticase soy broth (BBL) is reduced and ultimately destroyed by prolonged autoclaving at 121 C. Loss of antimicrobial activity {{is accompanied by}} decolorization of the dye. This is consistent with other evidence that antimicrobial {{activity of}} <b>brilliant</b> <b>green</b> resides in the colored dye ion. The dye is not decolorized when heated in distilled water or peptone, but is decolorized by heating in glucose, glycine, or sodium dodecyl sulfate, showing that decolorization results from reaction with components of the medium. To ensure optimal results, {{it is recommended that}} bacteriological media be sterilized by heat prior to addition of <b>brilliant</b> <b>green</b> dye...|$|R
40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activity of}} gentian violet and <b>brilliant</b> <b>green</b> was tested against various strains of potential skin pathogens, {{by means of}} agar diffusion assay. The activity of both compounds was affected by pH. Gentian violet {{was found to be}} more active than <b>brilliant</b> <b>green</b> at pH 7. 4, particularly against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The spectrum of activity of gentian violet was not increased by the addition of <b>brilliant</b> <b>green.</b> An aqueous solution of gentian violet 0. 5 % {{turned out to be an}} adequate topical anti-infective drug. The preparation is particularly suitable for primary health care in tropical developing countries, because it is cheap, chemically and physically stable, and easy to prepare...|$|R

40|$|Salmonellae in the {{environment}} remain a potential source of disease. Low numbers of salmonellae have been detected and enumerated from environmental samples by most-probable-number methods which require careful colony selection from a plated agar medium. A modified xylose lysine <b>brilliant</b> <b>green</b> medium was prepared to control the loss of selectivity caused by heating the <b>brilliant</b> <b>green</b> component. Added agar reduced colony spreading. The medium contained 47 g of xylose lysine agar base per liter; the agar content was adjusted to 2 %, autoclaved, cooled to 50 degrees C, and then amended just before pouring to include H 2 S indicator and 7 ppm (7 ml of 1 : 1, 000 <b>brilliant</b> <b>green</b> per liter) of unheated <b>brilliant</b> <b>green</b> dye. H 2 S-positive salmonellae were easily detected from sewage sludge compost {{to the exclusion of}} most other gram-negative bacteria. As a result, fewer non-salmonellae were picked for further most-probable-number analysis, greatly reducing the work load associated with the most-probable-number method. Direct plating was possible for enumerating salmonellae in laboratory composts containing ca. 10 (3) or more salmonellae...|$|R
