Specifically, the effect of the adsorbate type and the zeolite structure and composition on the interaction between adsorbate and the acid-site was examined. ^ The adsorption of toluene on H-ZSM- 5 was examined using TPD-TGA, infrared spectroscopy, and proton NMR. The isotope exchange between toluene and D-ZSM- 5 was found to occur through arenium-ion-like intermediates which were formed on H-ZSM- 5 at a stoichiometry of one per Al-site at temperatures as low as 273 K. ^ To examine the effect of Al concentration on the acid sites, the adsorption of methanol, 2 -propanol, and 2 -methyl- 2 -propanol was investigated on H-ZSM- 5 samples with silica-alumina ratios of 38, 70, and 520. <b>Adsorption</b> <b>complexes</b> of one molecule/Al were identified on each of the samples. Furthermore, the unimolecular reactivities of this 1 : 1 state were unaffected by the Al concentration, implying that the acid-sites are identical and are formed one per Al. <b>Adsorption</b> <b>complexes</b> were also observed for 2 -propanamine and 2 -propanone on H-ZSM- 5 samples. ^ To examine the effect of zeolite structure on the acid-sites, the adsorption of 2 -propanol and 2 -propanamine of H-ZSM- 12 and H-mordenite was examined. The 1 : 1 <b>adsorption</b> <b>complexes</b> which were formed were identical in reactivity to those formed in H-ZSM- 5, implying that the acid-sites formed by isolated Al atoms in a zeolite lattice are chemically equivalent, independent of the structure of the lattice. ^ The adsorption of ammonia, 2 -propanamine, and 2 -propanol on H-(B) -ZSM- 5, H-(Fe) -ZSM- 5, and H-(Ga) -ZSM- 5 was examined to investigate the effect of the incorporation of trivalent ions into the zeolite framework. <b>Adsorption</b> <b>complexes</b> corresponding to one molecule per substituent atom were identified. The reactivity of the complexes on H-(B) -ZSM- 5 indicates that the acid-sites formed by B-incorporation are much weaker than those associated with Fe, Ga, or Al.

The similarity in the temperature range of desorption and in the products obtained for these adsorbates indicates a similarity in the intermediates formed in the zeolite following adsorption. ...|$|R

The fundamental aspects of the adsorption, including the registries of the <b>adsorption</b> <b>complexes,</b> <b>adsorption</b> energies, and structural parameters are presented. The FeS surfaces are shown to be stabilized by hydration, as is perhaps to be expected because the adsorbed water molecules stabilize the low-coordinated surface atoms. As(OH) 3 adsorbs weakly at the water–FeS(001) interface through a network of hydrogen-bonded interactions with water molecules on the surface, with the lowest-energy structure calculated to be an As–up outer-sphere complex. Compared to the water–FeS(001) interface, stronger adsorption was calculated for As(OH) 3 on the water–FeS(011) and water–FeS(111) interfaces, characterized by strong hybridization between the S-p and O-p states of As(OH) 3 and the surface Fe-d states. The As(OH) 3 molecule displayed a variety of chemisorption geometries on the water–FeS(011) and water–FeS(111) interfaces, where the most stable configuration at the water–FeS(011) interface is a bidentate Fe–AsO–Fe complex, but on the water–FeS(111) interface, a monodentate Fe–O–Fe complex was found.

Stabilization of the <b>adsorption</b> <b>complexes</b> results from hydrogen bonding between the guest molecule and the framework, as well as from embedding, i. e., van der Waals interactions with the pore walls. Large-cluster calculations with different DFT methods, in particular B 3 LYP(-D), PBE(-D), M 062 X(-D), and omega B 97 X-D, are tested for their ability to reproduce the experimental heats of adsorption available in the literature (J.

The extended-cluster model is shown to offer an attractive alternative to periodic simulations on the entire H-ZSM- 5 unit cell, resulting in virtually identical final adsorption enthalpies.

40|$|Extracellular {{polymeric}} substances (EPS) are continuously produced by bacteria during their growth and metabolism. In soils, EPS {{are bound to}} cell surfaces, associated with biofilms, or released into solution where they can react with other solutes and soil particle surfaces. If such reaction results in a decrease in EPS bioaccessibility, it may contribute to stabilization of microbial-derived organic carbon (OC) in soil. Here we examined: (i) the chemical fractionation of EPS produced by a common Gram positive soil bacterial strain (Bacillus subtilis) during reaction with dissolved and colloidal Al species and (ii) the resulting stabilization against desorption and microbial decay by the respective coprecipitation (with dissolved Al) and adsorption (with Al(OH) 3 (am)) processes. Coprecipitates and <b>adsorption</b> <b>complexes</b> obtained following EPS-Al reaction {{as a function of}} pH and ionic strength were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The stability of adsorbed and coprecipitated EPS against biodegradation was assessed by mineralization experiments for 1100 h. Up to 60 % of the initial 100 mg/L EPS-C was adsorbed at the highest initial molar Al:C ratio (1. 86), but this still resulted only in a moderate OC mass fraction in the solid phase (17 mg/g Al(OH) 3 (am)). In contrast, while coprecipitation by Al was less efficient in removing EPS from solution (maximum values of 33 % at molar Al:C ratios of 0. 1 - 0. 2), the OC mass fraction in the solid product was substantially larger than that in <b>adsorption</b> <b>complexes.</b> Organic P compounds were preferentially bound during both adsorption and coprecipitation. Data are consistent with strong ligand exchange of EPS phosphoryl groups during adsorption to Al(OH) 3 (am), whereas for coprecipitation weaker sorption mechanisms are also involved.

Stabilization of adsorbed or coprecipitated EPS increased with increasing molar Al:C ratio and biodegradation was correlated with EPS desorption, implying that detachment of EPS from surface sites is a prerequisite for microbial utilization.

Two-fold ¿ 2 coordination of light alkanes is realized for MgY, whereas in case of CaY zeolite quite different adsorption modes are found, involving more C-H bonds in the interaction with the cation. The topological analysis of the electron density distribution function of the <b>adsorption</b> <b>complexes</b> shows that when a hydrocarbon coordinates to the exchanged Mg 2 + ions, van der Waals bonds between H atoms of the alkane and basic zeolitic oxygens significantly contribute to the overall adsorption energy, whereas in case of CaY zeolite such interactions play only an indirect role. It is found that, due to the much smaller ionic radius of the Mg 2 + ion as {{compared to that of}} Ca 2 +, the former ions are significantly shielded with the surrounding oxygens of the zeolitic cation site. This results in a small electrostatic contribution to the stabilization of the adsorbed molecules. In contrast, for CaY zeolite the stabilization of alkanes in the electrostatic field of the partially shielded Ca 2 + cation significantly contributes to the adsorption energy. This is in agreement with the experimentally observed lower overall absorption of C-H stretching vibrations of alkanes loaded to MgY as compared to those for CaY zeolite. The preferred conformation of the adsorbed alkanes is controlled by the bonding within the <b>adsorption</b> <b>complexes</b> that, in turn, strongly depends on the size and location of the cations in the zeolite cavity...|$|R
40|$|Structural, {{energetic}} and vibrational properties of acetylene absorbed on terraces {{as well as}} edge and corner sites of MgO(0 0 1) have been investigated computationally using a gradient-corrected density functional method. The oxide substrate was represented by model clusters embedded in large arrays of point charges (PCs); positive PCs at the cluster borders were substituted by pseudopotentials of Mg 2 + to reduce the artificial polarization of the nearby oxygen anions. From the calculations two types of <b>adsorption</b> <b>complexes</b> emerge: either a H atom of C 2 H 2 interacts with an O(2 -) ion of the substrate or the C-C triple bond interacts with a surface Mg 2 + cation. However, for adsorption at the regular MgO(0 0 1) surface only the first case of H-O interaction with C 2 H 2 perpendicular to the (0 0 1) plane is calculated to be stable, exhibiting very weak binding. Adsorption at edge and corner sites is notably stronger, with energies of 0. 2 - 0. 6 eV, favoring C-C interaction with Mg 2 +. In all cases, the infrared (IR) forbidden symmetric C-C and C-W stretching modes become activated due to adsorption. For all <b>adsorption</b> <b>complexes</b> considered, the stretching frequencies are calculated to be redshifted with respect to those of a free C 2 H 2 molecule. The redshifts of the C-C and C-H vibrational frequencies computed for adsorption of acetylene molecules at the regular MgO(0 0 1) sites are closest to the IR frequency shifts measured at low coverage on polycrystalline MgO samples with extended (0 0 1) terraces.

40|$|Adsorption isotherms were {{obtained}} for fulvic and humic acids on synthetic gibbsite and goethite and on a natural imogolite. The results were interpreted {{with the help of}} spectra of the <b>adsorption</b> <b>complexes,</b> and measurements of hydroxyl displaced. The mechanism of adsorption involved ligand exchange with the surface hydroxyl groups and hydrogen bonding. The hydroxyl groups displaced included singly coordinated species on the (100) face of goethite and on the edge faces of gibbsite. The doubly coordinated hydroxyl groups on the (001) face of gibbsite were not replaced, and this face adsorbed only un-ionized fulvic acid probably by a hydrogen bonding mechanism. Imogolite adsorbed most fulvic acid because of its high porosity. Only isolated places on its surface reacted with fulvic acid to form carboxylate groups...|$|R
