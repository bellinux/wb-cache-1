40|$|Loofah sponges {{are natural}} {{products}} used as exfoliative beauty aids. As {{a consequence of}} tracing a case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa folliculitis to a contaminated loofah sponge, we assessed the role <b>of</b> <b>loofah</b> sponges in supporting {{the growth of a}} wide variety of bacterial species. Our data show growth enhancement <b>of</b> sterile <b>loofah</b> fragments for numerous gram-negative (Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas, and Klebsiella) and gram-positive (Enterococcus and group B Streptococcus) species of human and environmental origin. Furthermore, hydrated new, unused loofah sponges undergo a shift in bacterial flora from sparse colonies of Bacillus spp. and Staphylococcus epidermidis to a predominantly gram-negative flora. The growth-promoting potential <b>of</b> <b>loofah</b> sponges (and other exfoliatives) can be further augmented by desquamated epithelial cells entrapped in the loofah fibrous matrix. Therefore, as loofah sponges (and other exfoliatives) can serve as a reservoir and a vehicle for the transmission of potentially pathogenic species to the human skin, we recommend their decontamination with hypochlorite (10 %) bleach at regular intervals...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa folliculitis is a {{well-known}} entity that occurs among users of closed-cycle recreational water sources such as whirlpools, swimming pools, and hot tubs. In the absence of this epidemiologic link, isolated cases are difficult to diagnose. We encountered a patient who developed P. aeruginosa folliculitis subsequent to the use <b>of</b> a <b>loofah</b> sponge grossly contaminated with the same P. aeruginosa strain (serotype 10; pyocin type 1 /a 4,b) that was recovered from her skin lesions. Furthermore, we demonstrated that sterile unused loofah sponges can serve as the sole growth-promoting substrate for P. aeruginosa. To obviate the potential public health problem <b>of</b> contaminated <b>loofah</b> sponges, it is strongly recommended that manufacturers append, and consumers adhere to, instructions as to the care <b>of</b> <b>loofah</b> sponges, which includes allowing the sponge to dry after use. Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the immunocompromised host is an important cause of systemic infection which may be accompanied by cutaneous manifestations including ery-thematous nodules (7, 10), abscesses, vesicles, and cellulitis (6), erysipelas-like lesions (8), and ecthyma gangrenosum (4) ...|$|R
40|$|Neste trabalho, foi analisado o efeito de um tratamento químico, ou seja, de acetilação de grupos, sobre a estrutura e a morfologia {{superficial}} de fibras de bucha (Luffa cylindrica) por meio de FTIR e microscopia eletrônica de varredura. Esse tratamento foi realizado tendo por objetivo aumentar a compatibilidade da bucha com as matrizes poliméricas usualmente empregadas em compósitos. Mostrou-se que o tratamento reduziu a polaridade das moléculas de celulose e removeu a camada superficial das fibras de bucha, expondo a sua estrutura fibrilar interna, com conseqüente aumento da área disponível para a adesão. In {{this work}} {{the effect of}} a new chemical surface treatment on the structure and surface morphology <b>of</b> <b>loofah</b> fibers (Luffa cylindrica) was analyzed, using infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy.

40|$|AbstractThe {{production}} of biofuels including ethanol and hydrogen from agricultural waste is being concern as a renewable energy. Pineapple peel, {{a by-product of}} the pineapple processing industry, account for 29 - 40 % (w/w) of total pineapple weight. 36. 25 ± 2. 87 % of cellulose was achieved from pineapple peel after pretreatment with water and heat at 100 oC for 4 h. Afterwards, 0. 5 % (w/w) cellulase from Aspergillus niger (Sigma) was added for enzymatic hydrolysis. The maximum sugar production (34. 03 ± 1. 30 g/L) was obtained after 24 h of incubation time. The enzyme hydrolysate was utilized as fermentation medium, with no nutritional addition to produce ethanol and hydrogen by Saccharomyces cerevisiae TISTR 5048 and Enterobacter aerogenes TISTR 1468. The maximum yield of ethanol (9. 69 g/L) with no hydrogen production by S. cerevisiae was achieved after 72 h. However, the maximum ethanol and hydrogen from E. aerogenes were 1. 38 g/L and 1, 416 mL/L after 72 h and 12 h of cultivation, respectively.

Electrocapacitive properties of four porous carbon-based electrodes were investigated with cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in symmetric supercapacitors. All the cyclic voltammetries of four types of supercapacitors showed a rectangular shape, even under a high scan rate of 500 mV·s− 1. The capacitances of LSC- 1, LSC- 2, LSC- 3, and LSC- 4 were 107. 4, 92. 5, 60. 3, and 82. 3 F·g− 1 at the current density of 0. 1 A·g− 1, respectively, and LSC- 1 displayed the excellent capacitance retention of about 81. 3 % with a current density up to 5 A·g− 1. All supercapacitors showed excellent electrochemical stability, and the LSC- 1 -based supercapacitor showed a cycle stability with 92. 6 % capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 1 A·g− 1.
