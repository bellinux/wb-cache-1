Subjects were told to click the mouse button whenever they felt the intention to do so. One group was given a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulse, {{and the other was}} given a sham TMS. Subjects in the intention condition were told to move the cursor to where it was when they felt the inclination to press the button. In the movement condition, subjects moved their cursor to where it was when they physically pressed the button. Results showed the TMS was able to shift the perceived intention forward by 16ms, and shifted back the 14ms for the movement condition. Perceived intention could be manipulated up to 200ms after the execution of the spontaneous action, indicating that the perception of intention occurred after the executive motor movements. Often it is thought that free will were to exist, it would require intention to be the causal source of behavior. These results show that intention may not be the causal source of all behavior.|$|E

5000|$|Dau <b>al</b> <b>Set</b> (...) , {{the first}} post-World War II artistic {{movement}} in Catalonia, {{was founded in}} Barcelona in September 1948 by poet Joan Brossa. The movement, best known for translating the conscious and unconscious mind into art, was heavily influenced by both the Surrealist and Dadaist movements. In Catalan Dau <b>al</b> <b>Set</b> means [...] "the seventh face of the dice", which expresses the movement's rupturist character.|$|E

50|$|Another {{influence}} on Dau <b>al</b> <b>Set</b> was Surrealism, a cultural movement {{greatly influenced by}} Dadaism, {{which began in the}} 1920s. This style was often considered a portrayal of the dream world; a reality which existed right below everyday life. It also had a large political focus which was often used to contradict a given community's social norms often imposed by the bourgeois. Some artists from this movement that influenced Dau <b>al</b> <b>Set</b> were Joan Miró, Paul Klee, Josep Vicenç Foix, and Salvador Dalí. Other methods that were influenced was the idea of magical aspects that were often seen in the dream world surrealism created. However, in Dau <b>al</b> <b>Set</b> these magical aspects were developed and expounded upon.|$|E
50|$|In 1949, {{with help}} from Joan-Josep Tharrats's private {{printing}} press, Dau <b>al</b> <b>Set</b> published its first self-entitled magazine journal. The majority of the publication was written in Catalan, a language prohibited under the Franco Regime. Dau <b>al</b> <b>Set</b> typically ran a print between one hundred and two hundred copies, consisting of four to twelve pages. The magazine journal was delivered throughout Barcelona to those with subscriptions and served a niche population at the time. The format of the magazine was 22.5 cm x 18.7 cm in the broadsheet style and never bound. These publications continued {{on a regular basis}} until the end of 1951 at which point Dau <b>al</b> <b>Set</b> began to dissolve.|$|E

Though the Dau <b>al</b> <b>Set</b> group ultimately disbanded in 1954, Ponç continued presenting his own artwork until 1980.|$|E

50|$|Initially, Dau <b>al</b> <b>Set</b> {{began as}} an {{offshoot}} of Surrealism, but slowly grew into a distinct style with many existing components. One such component began with the incorporation of the surrealist world of dreams, where in Dau <b>al</b> <b>Set</b> expands upon by combing scientific and philosophical articles with magical undertones derived from Joan Brossa's personalized style. The use of magical elements pervaded throughout the entire movement to showcase an esoteric world of inner exploration. While magic was seen consistently the different members each contributed a unique style to Dau <b>al</b> <b>Set.</b> One of the most drastic was the contributions from Joan Ponç. Ponç's art frequently contained demonic images actualized {{with a series of}} different monsters throughout the work. In contrast, Modest Cuixart's work often contained images of fantasy influenced by German expressionism and Joan Miró. Finally, Antoni Tápies often emulated the style of Paul Klee with obscure images surrounded by a dark atmosphere and phosphorescent lighting. With the base of magical elements these three unique techniques joined together to create the style seen in the Dau <b>al</b> <b>Set</b> movement.|$|E
50|$|Dau <b>al</b> <b>set</b> was a Catalan avant-garde {{magazine}} {{founded in}} September 1948 by Joan-Josep Tharrats {{and directed by}} Joan Ponç. The magazine was produced by the artistic group Dau <b>al</b> <b>Set.</b> It was the continuation of another magazine called Algol (magazine) published by the same group. The magazine had eight pages measuring 250 x 175 mm. The texts were written in Catalan and Spanish. The magazine continued publishing numbers until December 1951.|$|E
50|$|Dau <b>al</b> <b>Set</b> {{was heavily}} {{influenced}} by two movements before its creation, those two being Dadaism and Surrealism. Dadaism was a European art movement in the early 20th century which focused on the avant-garde. This style was meant {{to fight against the}} bourgeois in society with the belief that their reason and logic were the cause of war. With an anti-reason and anti-logic sentiment most of the works of art often contained elements of chaos and irrationality. Dadaist art also utilized the following techniques of cubism, collages, cut-up technique, photomontages, and assemblage which can be seen in Dau al Set's work. From this movement spawned the pre-war avant-garde which was the community Dau <b>al</b> <b>Set</b> were trying to revive. Some influential artists on Dau <b>al</b> <b>Set</b> from this movement are Francis Picabia and Max Ernst.|$|E

50|$|In 1948, Tàpies helped co-found {{the first}} Post-War Movement in Spain known as Dau <b>al</b> <b>Set</b> which was {{connected}} to the Surrealist and Dadaist Movements. The main leader and founder of Dau <b>al</b> <b>Set</b> was the poet Joan Brossa. The movement also had a publication of the same name, Dau <b>al</b> <b>Set.</b> Tàpies started as a surrealist painter, his early works were influenced by Paul Klee and Joan Miró; but soon become an informal artist, working in a style known as pintura matèrica, in which non artistic materials are incorporated into the paintings. In 1953 he began working in mixed media; this is considered his most original contribution to art. One of the first to create serious art in this way, he added clay and marble dust to his paint and used waste paper, string, and rags (Grey and Green Painting, Tate Gallery, London, 1957). Canvas Burned to Matter from c. 1960, {{in the collection of the}} Honolulu Museum of Art, is an example of the artist's mixed media assemblages that combine the principles of Dada and Surrealism.|$|E

40|$|Action Learning (AL) for Continuous Improvement and Enhanced Innovation in Construction is a {{research}} programme of Academic Enterprise, University of Salford. The aim {{of the project was}} to find out how effective action learning might be in developing more innovative working methods in small and medium-sized building businesses in the construction industry. Four construction based <b>AL</b> <b>SETs</b> have been set up {{in different parts of the}} UK; a SET is a group of people, normally between 6 - 8 people with complementary problems, who band together as "partners in adversity" to discuss how they might learn from their own actions as they attempt to resolve key and complex issues. Each of our Construction <b>AL</b> <b>SETs</b> is in a different phase of its development, but the progress made by them all is exciting. Members of such SETs first seem to gain a systemic confidence of the new construction tasks in front of them and then become more innovative and creative in their resulting every day actions. They begin to explore new possibilities for change and seem to be able drive improvement from the "ashes" of their own site problems, issues, and failures. The innovations they come up with are typically fairly small scale to begin with, but soon grow, and often combine with others to have a fairly large impact on the productivity of their organisation. Our evidence suggests AL does seem to be able to create the sort of deep-seated cultural change needed by the construction. The AL process is initially heavily dependent upon the support of skilled SET Advisors who facilitate necessary changes in attitude and behaviour. This early facilitation is essential if it is to work successfully, however, SETs soon learn to look after themselves, growing from strength to strength in confidence and then develop [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A popular {{approach}} to apprenticeship learning (AL) is to formulate {{it as an}} inverse reinforce-ment learning (IRL) problem. The MaxEnt-IRL al-gorithm successfully integrates the maximum en-tropy principle into IRL and unlike its predecessors, it resolves the ambiguity arising {{from the fact that}} a possibly large number of policies could match the expert’s behavior. In this paper, we study an <b>AL</b> <b>setting</b> in which in addition to the expert’s tra-jectories, a number of unsupervised trajectories is available. We introduce MESSI, a novel algorithm that combines MaxEnt-IRL with principles com-ing from semi-supervised learning. In particular, MESSI integrates the unsupervised data into the MaxEnt-IRL framework using a pairwise penalty on trajectories. Empirical results in a highway driv-ing and grid-world problems indicate that MESSI is {{able to take advantage of}} the unsupervised trajecto-ries and improve the performance of MaxEnt-IRL. ...|$|R
