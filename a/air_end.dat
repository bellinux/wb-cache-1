Firstly, the systematic approach to energy savings is presented. Following, various energy-saving measures have been reviewed. They encompassed system analysis and harmonization of production and consumption, minimisation of loses (leak prevention strategy, identification and quantification of leakages), possibilities for reducing pressure drop on filters, and three methods for optimization of pneumatic control: by-pass control, PWM control, and usage of exhaust air. Finally, energy conservation of a complex robotic cell with installed electric and pneumatic devices is shown...|$|E

40|$|Soil is {{our life}} support system, {{crucial for the}} {{production}} of food and biomass and critical for the sustainability of an agro–environmental economy. The authors suggest that it is axiomatic that Ireland should have ready access to its soil information through the benefits of modern information technology. Soil is a multifunctional and complex natural medium that provides ecosystem services such as the production of food, fibre and fuel, the provision of habitat, nutrient cycling, contaminant transformation, water cycling and climate regulation. Reports from the European Commission indicate that many of these functions and services are under threat and soil protection is now placed on the same level as that of water and <b>air.</b> <b>End</b> of project reportThis synthesis report has been prepared as part of the Environmental Research Technological Development and Innovation (ERTDI) Programme under the Productive Sector Operational Programme 2000 - 2006. This programme is financed by the Irish Government under the National Development Plan 2000 - 2006.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} need for {{compressed}} air free of entrained oil {{to be used in}} industry. In many cases it can be supplied by oil flooded screw compressors with multi stage filtration systems, or by oil free screw compressors. However, if water injected screw compressors can be made to operate reliably, they could be more efficient and therefore cheaper to operate. Unfortunately, to date, such machines have proved to be insufficiently reliable and not cost effective. This paper describes an investigation carried out to determine the current limitations of water injected screw compressor systems and how these could be overcome in the 15 - 315 kW power range and delivery pressures of 6 - 10 bar. Modern rotor profiles and approach to sealing and cooling allow reasonably inexpensive <b>air</b> <b>end</b> design. The prototype of the water injected screw compressor air system was built and tested for performance and reliability. The water injected compressor system was compared with the oil injected and oil free compressor systems of the equivalent size including the economic analysis based on the lifecycle costs. Based on the obtained results, it was concluded that water injected screw compressor systems could be designed to deliver clean air free of oil contamination with a better user value proposition than the oil injected or oil free screw compressor systems over the considered range of operations...|$|E
