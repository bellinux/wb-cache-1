5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1802, Wrexham was visited by a troupe of {{travelling}} comedians. One of the leaders, who had heard Randles play, requested that she performed with them. Before the age of two, she joined the troupe at Wrexham theatre to play Ar hyd y nos and The Downfall of Paris. There, she played her pieces with an apple <b>and</b> <b>slice</b> of cake {{on either side of}} the piano, receiving both when she finished for playing well. Over the next nine months, Randles played at the houses of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, Lady Dungannon and Lady Cunliffe. Williams-Wynn proposed that Randles play in a Wrexham concert during the spring of 1803, under the direction of the Welsh harpist John Parry. The concert was postponed a number of times due to the illness of Randles' mother, who insisted they carry on without her. On the night of the concert, Randles' mother died, after hearing that it was a success.|$|E

ASCII Media Works published 26 novels from November 2002 to November 2012 under their Dengeki Bunko imprint. The story focuses on Yuji Sakai, a high school boy who inadvertently becomes involved in an age-old conflict between forces of balance and imbalance in existence.

40|$|Processed foods usually undergo one {{or several}} unit food {{processing}} operations before becoming the final products. Many food processing equipments {{were developed to}} perform more than one operation in food processing by providing practical purposes that further enhance their performance. However, conventional processes of grating <b>and</b> <b>slicing</b> that produce grated <b>and</b> <b>sliced</b> food products normally involved two units of independent operation machines. Therefore in this study, grating <b>and</b> <b>slicing</b> processes have been combined into a single operation through an integrated machine for simultaneous grating <b>and</b> <b>slicing</b> operations. The purpose of integrating both grating <b>and</b> <b>slicing</b> processes is to increase productivity through the reduction of cost, time {{and the number of}} unit operations, which are involved in the processing system of grating <b>and</b> <b>slicing</b> production. The machine’s design specifications were identified to ensure that simultaneous grating <b>and</b> <b>slicing</b> operations in an integrated machine are capable to process the raw materials (starchy vegetables) simultaneously for grated <b>and</b> <b>sliced</b> outputs. A final machine design was generated by following a product development process as the research method. The design process steps starts from planning, concept development, detail design and machine fabrication, testing and refinement. The final design of the machine (at present) shows that it is suitable for use in industrial processing level which the output rate is powered at 750 W with variable speed of 0 – 180 rpm, grated <b>and</b> <b>sliced</b> production range of 750 – 1200 kg/h and 25...|$|R

In Delray Beach, lightning struck a tree, causing part of it to fall through an awning, break a window, <b>and</b> <b>slice</b> into a house.

However, in response to flooding, all Palm Beach County schools were closed on August27 and August28.

Damage estimates for Palm Beach County reached $71.59million, $40million of which was incurred to the Indian Trail Improvement District.|$|E

That is, water slice 1 is emptied, using gravity and valves, into a basin that is at the same level as water slice 2.

60|$|He mixed the {{shortening}} {{with the}} flour, and, adding water, {{he began a}} thorough kneading. When {{the consistency of the}} mixture appeared to satisfy him he took a handful of it, rolled it into a ball, patted and flattened it into a biscuit, and dropped it into the oven he had set aside on the hot coals. Swiftly he shaped eight or ten other biscuits and dropped them as the first. Then he put the heavy iron lid on the pot, and with a rude shovel, improvised from a flattened tin can, he shoveled red coals out of the fire, and covered the lid with them. His next move was to pare <b>and</b> <b>slice</b> potatoes, placing these aside in a pan. A small black coffee-pot half full of water, was set on a glowing part of the fire. Then he brought into use a huge, heavy knife, a murderous-looking implement it appeared to Carley, with which he cut slices of ham. These he dropped into the second pot, which he left uncovered. Next he removed the flour sack and other inpedimenta from the table, and proceeded to set places for two--blue-enamel plate and cup, with plain, substantial-looking knives, forks, and spoons. He went outside, to return presently carrying a small crock of butter. Evidently he had kept the butter in or near the spring. It looked dewy and cold and hard. After that he peeped under the lid of the pot which contained the biscuits. The other pot was sizzling and smoking, giving forth a delicious savory odor that affected Carley most agreeably. The coffee-pot had begun to steam. With a long fork Glenn turned the slices of ham and stood a moment watching them. Next he placed cans of three sizes upon the table; and these Carley conjectured contained sugar, salt, and pepper. Carley might not have been present, for all the attention he paid to her. Again he peeped at the biscuits. At the edge of the hot embers he placed a tin plate, upon which he carefully deposited the slices of ham. Carley had not needed sight of them to know she was hungry; they made her simply ravenous. That done, he poured the pan of sliced potatoes into the pot. Carley judged the heat of that pot to be extreme. Next he removed the lid from the other pot, exposing biscuits slightly browned; and evidently satisfied with these, he removed them from the coals. He stirred the slices of potatoes round and round; he emptied two heaping tablespoonfuls of coffee into the coffee-pot.|$|E
60|$|Their food {{consisted}} of robbiboo, {{a compound of}} flour, pemmican, and water, boiled to the consistency of very thick soup. Though not a species of food that would satisfy the fastidious taste of an epicure, robbiboo is, nevertheless, very wholesome, exceedingly nutritious, and withal palatable. Pemmican, its principal component, is made of buffalo flesh, which fully equals (some think greatly excels) beef. The recipe for making it is as follows:--First kill your buffalo--a matter of considerable difficulty, by the way, as doing so requires you {{to travel to the}} buffalo-grounds, to arm yourself with a gun, and mount a horse, on which you have to gallop, perhaps, several miles over rough ground and among badger-holes, at the imminent risk of breaking your neck. Then you have to run up alongside of a buffalo and put a ball through his heart, which, apart from the murderous nature of the action, is a difficult thing to do. But we will suppose that you have killed your buffalo. Then you must skin him; then cut him up, <b>and</b> <b>slice</b> the flesh into layers, which must be dried in the sun. At this stage of the process you have produced a substance which in the fur countries goes by the name of dried meat, and is largely used as an article of food. As its name implies, it is very dry, and it is also very tough, and very undesirable if one can manage to procure anything better. But to proceed. Having thus prepared dried meat, lay a quantity of it on a flat stone, and take another stone, with which pound it into shreds. You must then take the animal's hide, while it is yet new, and make bags of it about two feet and a half long by {{a foot and a half}} broad. Into this put the pounded meat loosely. Melt the fat of your buffalo over a fire, and when quite liquid pour it into the bag until full; mix the contents well together; sew the whole up before it cools, and you have a bag of pemmican of about ninety pounds weight. This forms the chief food of the voyageur, in consequence of its being the largest possible quantity of sustenance compressed into the smallest possible space, and in an extremely convenient, portable shape. It will keep fresh for years, and has been much used, in consequence, by the heroes of arctic discovery, in their perilous journeys along the shores of the frozen sea.|$|E
