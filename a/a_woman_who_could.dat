Stone applied to the voting board in Boston but was required to sign her husband's surname as her own. She refused, and never participated in that vote.|$|E

A leading member of this kindred, Donnchad mac Briain, King of Munster, was married to Cacht ingen Ragnaill, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> have been closely related to Echmarcach. Certainly, Echmarcach's daughter, Mór, married one of Donnchad's Uí Briain close kinsmen. Echmarcach's violent career brought him into bitter conflict with a particular branch of the Uí Ímair who had held Dublin periodically from the early eleventh century. This branch {{was supported by the}} rising Uí Cheinnselaig, an Irish kindred responsible for Echmarcach's final expulsion from Dublin and apparently Mann as well.|$|E
500|$|Treves {{observed}} that Merrick was very sensitive and showed his emotions easily. At times Merrick was bored and lonely, and demonstrated signs of depression. He {{had spent his}} entire adult life segregated from women, first in the workhouse and then as an exhibit. The women he met were either disgusted or frightened by his appearance. His opinions about women were derived from his memories {{of his mother and}} what he read in books. Treves decided that Merrick would like to be introduced to a woman and it would help him feel normal. The doctor arranged for a friend of his named Mrs. Leila Maturin, [...] "a young and pretty widow", to visit Merrick. She agreed and with fair warning about his appearance, she went to his rooms for an introduction. The meeting was short, as Merrick quickly became overcome with emotion. He later told Treves that Maturin had been the first woman ever to smile at him, the first to shake his hand. She kept in contact with him and a letter written by Merrick to her, thanking her for the gift of a book and a brace of grouse (a pair of birds), is the only surviving letter written by Merrick. This first experience of meeting a woman, though brief, instilled in Merrick a new sense of self-confidence. He met other women during his life at the hospital, and appeared taken with them all. Treves believed that Merrick's hope was to go to live at an institution for the blind, where he might meet <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> not see his deformities.|$|E

500|$|The year 1983 saw Streep play {{her first}} non-fictional character, the nuclear {{whistleblower}} and labor union activist Karen Silkwood {{who died in}} a suspicious car accident while investigating alleged wrongdoing at the Kerr-McGee plutonium plant, in Mike Nichols's biographical film Silkwood. Streep felt a personal connection to Silkwood, and in preparation she met with people close to the woman, and in doing so realized that each person saw a different aspect of her personality. She said, [...] "I didn't try to turn myself into Karen. I just tried to look at what she did. I put together every piece of information I could find about her... What I finally did was look at the events in her life, and try to understand her from the inside." [...] Jack Kroll of Newsweek considered Streep's characterization to have been [...] "brilliant", while Silkwood's boyfriend Drew Stephens expressed approval in that Streep had played Karen as a human being rather than a myth, despite Karen's father Bill thinking that Streep and the film had dumbed his daughter down. Pauline Kael believed that Streep had been miscast. Streep next played opposite Robert De Niro in the romance Falling in Love (1984), which was poorly received, and portrayed a fighter for the French Resistance during World War II in the British drama Plenty (1985), adapted from the play by David Hare. For the latter, Roger Ebert wrote that she conveyed [...] "great subtlety; it is hard to play an unbalanced, neurotic, self-destructive woman, and do it with such gentleness and charm... Streep creates a whole character around <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> have simply been a catalogue of symptoms." [...] In 2008, Molly Haskell praised Streep's performance in Plenty, believing it to be [...] "one of Streep's most difficult and ambiguous" [...] films and [...] "most feminist" [...] role.|$|E
500|$|Due to [...] "protective and {{occasionally}} nervous" [...] fans, Kripke meant for Bela {{to be introduced}} in [...] "small doses". He wanted fans to know the show would always be just about Sam and Dean Winchester, and stated, [...] " [...] there for important plot elements, but it's not the Ruby and Bela show, nor {{is it about the}} four of them cruising around in the Impala together. It's about the guys." [...] However, he felt the writers pushed it too far in the episode [...] "Red Sky at Morning", stating his opinion that it [...] "was by far the least successful episode this year because it really kind of became the Bela show". The writers also did not take the time to consider how to tie her into the Winchesters' storylines. As Kripke pointed out, [...] "It's a road show and we're in a different town every week, so if you're going to run into the same character over and over again, you better have a damn good reason..." [...] They were eventually [...] "crushed {{under the weight of the}} absurdity of it" [...] because it became more difficult to justify her reappearances within the narrative. Another key problem stemmed from their conceptualization of her as an antagonistic character rather than a potential love interest for the brothers. The writers, [...] "so taken with <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> screw the boys over at every turn", ended up making Bela too antagonistic without establishing a balance. Any chance for a [...] "funny effervescent episode where they all work together" [...] was lost after the character attempts to have the Winchesters killed on multiple occasions. They eventually decided to drop the character from the series, opting to [...] "send her off in an appropriate and dramatic way" [...] which would [...] "show a couple of cards [...] been holding onto all season" [...] by revealing her backstory [...] "in a way that will surprise the audience and kind of tie her into the story." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paying fines {{broke the}} society into {{economic}} and social demographics in that the wealthy were free {{to do as much}} as they could afford, whereas the fines themselves placed different values on the gender and ethnic demographics. [...] This social capital is evident in the differences in the Salic Law's punishment for murder based on a woman's ability to bear children. Women who could bear children were protected by a 600 shilling fine while the fine for murdering <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> no longer bear children was only 200 shillings. It is also interesting that all crimes committed against Romans had lesser fines than other social classes.|$|E

2500|$|A recent {{functional}} imaging {{study reported}} {{the case of}} <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> experience out of body experience at will. She reported developing the ability {{as a child and}} associated it with difficulties in falling sleep. Her OBEs continued into adulthood but became less frequent. She was able to see herself rotating in the air above her body, lying flat, and rolling in the horizontal plane. She reported sometimes watching herself move from above but remained aware of her unmoving [...] "real" [...] body. The participant reported no particular emotions linked to the experience. [...] "he brain functional changes associated with the reported extra-corporeal experience (ECE) were different than those observed in motor imagery. Activations were mainly left-sided and involved the left supplementary motor area and supramarginal and posterior superior temporal gyri, the last two overlapping with the temporal parietal junction that has been associated with out-of-body experiences. The cerebellum also showed activation that is consistent with the participant’s report of the impression of movement during the ECE. There was also left middle and superior orbital frontal gyri activity, regions often associated with action monitoring." ...|$|E
2500|$|Joe Maxson, who {{had been}} hired to replace Lamphere in February 1908, awoke {{in the early hours}} of April 28, 1908, smelling smoke in his room, which was on the second floor of the Gunness house. He opened the hall door to a sheet of flames. Maxson screamed Gunness' name and those of her {{children}} but got no response. He slammed the door and then, in his underwear, leapt from the second-story window of his room, barely surviving the fire that was closing in around him. He raced to town to get help, but by the time the old-fashioned hook-and-ladder arrived at the farm at early dawn, the farmhouse was a gutted heap of smoking ruins. Four bodies were found inside the house. [...] One of the bodies was that of <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> not immediately be identified as Gunness, since it had no head. The head was never found. The bodies of Gunness' children were found still in their beds. County Sheriff Smutzer had somehow heard about Lamphere’s alleged threats; he took one look at the carnage and quickly sought out the ex-handyman. Leliter came forward to recount his tale about Gunness' will and how she feared Lamphere would kill her and her family and burn her house down.|$|E
