2500|$|The World War I Victory Medals {{were awarded}} {{after the end}} of World War I, so they were mailed to the {{servicemen}} instead of awarded in person. For example, the boxes containing the Victory Medals for United States Army World War I veterans were mailed out by the depot officer at the General Supply Depot, U.S. Army, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in April 1921. An outer light brown box with an <b>address</b> <b>label</b> glued to it and its postage area marked [...] "OFFICIAL BUSINESS, Penalty for private use $300" [...] contained an inner white box stamped with the bars the serviceman was supposed to receive on his medal. The inner white box contained the medal, which was wrapped in tissue paper.|$|E

50|$|Originally, the {{subscribers}} had to {{send back}} the previous month's disk when the following issue was received; reusable mailers were used for this purpose, with a postage-paid return <b>address</b> <b>label</b> {{on the flip side}} of the <b>address</b> <b>label</b> used for outbound mailing, which was inserted in a plastic Ziploc baggie {{on the outside of the}} mailer so it could be reversed by the recipient. This disk return requirement was due in part to the fact that floppy disks were more expensive in those days and needed to be reused for economy, but was also designed to allow the subscribers to participate by leaving feedback electronically on the returning disks, as well as article and program submissions.|$|E

40|$|A {{system to}} segment and {{recognize}} Australian 4 -digit postcodes from <b>address</b> <b>labels</b> on parcels is described. Images of <b>address</b> <b>labels</b> are preprocessed and adaptively thresholded to reduce noise. Projections {{are used to}} segment the line and then the characters comprising the postcode. Individual digits are recognized using bispectral features extracted from their parallel beam projections. These features are insensitive to translation, scaling and rotation, and robust to noise. Results on scanned images are presented. The system is currently being improved and implemented to work on-line...|$|R

50|$|One of Tinker Toy’s most {{distinctive}} features is the toy’s packaging. Initially, the mailing tube design {{was chosen to}} reduce shipping costs. Early versions of the packaging included an <b>address</b> <b>label</b> on the tube with space for postage. To assist consumers in differentiating between the various offerings, sets were placed in mail tube packages of different sizes and also delineated with a number (ex: 116, 136) and a name (ex: major, prep, big boy, junior, grad). A colorful “how-to” instruction guide accompanied each set. In the 1950s, color was added and the wooden sticks appeared in red, green, blue, and yellow.|$|E
50|$|Similarly to {{telephones}} {{being labeled}} with their telephone number, {{it was a}} common practice in early networks to attach an <b>address</b> <b>label</b> to networked devices. The dynamic nature of modern networks, especially residential networks in which devices are powered up only when needed, requires ad-hoc, dynamic address assignment mechanisms {{that do not require}} user involvement for initialization and management. These systems automatically give themselves common names chosen either by the equipment manufacturer, such as a brand and model number, or chosen by users for identifying their equipment. The names and addresses are then automatically entered into a directory service.|$|E
