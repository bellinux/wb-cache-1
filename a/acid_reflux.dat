25|$|Those {{with the}} eating {{disorder}} bulimia {{are more likely}} to develop Barrett’s esophagus because bulimia can cause severe <b>acid</b> <b>reflux</b> (and purging obviously floods the esophagus with acid the same way <b>acid</b> <b>reflux</b> disease would).|$|E
25|$|Stimulation {{of sensory}} receptors in the {{esophagus}} result in sensations {{felt in the}} throat when swallowing, vomiting, or during <b>acid</b> <b>reflux.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pharyngitis {{may also}} be caused by mechanical, {{chemical}} or thermal irritation, for example cold air or <b>acid</b> <b>reflux.</b> Some medications may produce pharyngitis such as pramipexole and antipsychotics.|$|E
25|$|Gastroesophageal reflux {{disease can}} also lead to enamel loss, as <b>acid</b> <b>refluxes</b> up the {{esophagus}} and into the mouth, occurring most during overnight sleep.|$|R
30|$|Acid {{hydrolysis}} using concentrated HCl and TFA (25 °C/reflux) {{also failed}} to yield any <b>acid.</b> <b>Refluxing</b> with KOH and ethanol led to decarboxylation due to higher refluxing temperature (around 80 °C). These observations propelled us to use a solvent with a lower boiling point.|$|R
40|$|In short-segment Barrett's {{oesophagus}} (SSBO) heartburn may {{be absent}} and oesophageal acid exposure time (OAET) assessed with pH-only monitoring may be normal. By detecting reflux episodes independently of their acidity, multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH (MII-pH) monitoring allows a comprehensive characterization of reflux events, either off or on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. AIM: To assess reflux parameters by MII-pH monitoring in newly diagnosed SSBO, at baseline and as modified with PPI therapy. METHODS: Short-segment Barrett's oesophagus {{was defined by}} oesophageal intestinal metaplasia up to 3 cm in length. 24 -h MII-pH monitoring was performed before and during PPI therapy. RESULTS: Fifty patients were studied prospectively. Normal OAET was found at baseline in 15 patients (30 %), 8 and 2 of whom with a higher than normal number of acid and weakly acidic refluxes, respectively. Overall, abnormal reflux parameters were detected by MII-pH monitoring in 90 % of patients. Reflux events were prevalent in the upright period. On PPI therapy, <b>acid</b> <b>refluxes</b> decreased and a correspondent increase in weakly acidic refluxes was observed (median from 48. 5 to 9 and from 16 to 57. 5, respectively) (P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Acid</b> <b>refluxes,</b> mainly in the upright period, characterize SSBO. PPI therapy transforms <b>acid</b> <b>refluxes</b> into weakly acidic refluxes...|$|R
25|$|Esophageal bezoars in the nasogastrically fed {{patients}} on mechanical ventilation and sedation {{have been reported}} to be due to precipitation of certain food types rich in casein, which get precipitated with gastric <b>acid</b> <b>reflux</b> to form esophageal bezoars.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of <b>acid</b> <b>reflux</b> disease (GERD – gastroesphogeal reflux disease) or larynx reflux disease {{can also be}} a major factor. Stomach acids that flow up through the esophagus can damage its lining and raise susceptibility to throat cancer.|$|E
25|$|The {{diaphragm}} is {{also involved}} in non-respiratory functions, helping to expel vomit, feces, and urine from the body by increasing intra-abdominal pressure, aiding in childbirth, and preventing <b>acid</b> <b>reflux</b> by exerting pressure on the esophagus as it passes through the esophageal hiatus.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that Hoffmann did as most chemists have always done, {{starting}} by studying the literature and recreating the published methods. On 10 August 1897 (according to his laboratory notebooks), Hoffmann found a better method for making ASA, from salicylic <b>acid</b> <b>refluxed</b> with acetic anhydride.|$|R
50|$|Many people {{experience}} a burning sensation in their chest occasionally, caused by stomach <b>acids</b> <b>refluxing</b> into the esophagus, normally called heartburn. Extended exposure to heartburn may erode {{the lining of}} the esophagus, leading potentially to Barrett's esophagus which is associated with an increased risk of adenocarcinoma most commonly found in the distal one-third of the esophagus.|$|R
50|$|People {{who suffer}} from GERD usually have {{symptoms}} such as esophageal damage that result from the stomach acid shooting up into the esophagus. The acid can irritate the tissues of the esophagus resulting in a sore throat and persistent coughing. Patients {{who suffer from}} laryngopharyngeal reflux, or LPR, {{are more likely to}} experience symptoms as a result of stomach <b>acid</b> <b>refluxing</b> into the larynx.|$|R
25|$|Male {{predominance}} {{is particularly}} strong {{in this type}} of esophageal cancer, which occurs about 7 to 10 times more frequently in men.

25|$|In {{most cases}} however, a hiatal hernia {{does not cause}} any symptoms. The pain and {{discomfort}} that a patient experiences {{is due to the}} reflux of gastric acid, air, or bile. While there are several causes of <b>acid</b> <b>reflux,</b> it occurs more frequently in the presence of hiatal hernia.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} types (i.e. squamous-cell {{carcinoma}} and adenocarcinoma) have distinct sets of risk factors. Squamous-cell carcinoma {{is linked to}} lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol. Adenocarcinoma {{has been linked to}} effects of long-term <b>acid</b> <b>reflux.</b> Tobacco is a risk factor for both types. Both types are more common people over 60 years of age.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{method of}} {{decomposition}} for tungsten residue using concentrated hydrochloric <b>acid</b> by <b>reflux</b> is presented. The hydrochloric acid concentration, hydrochloric <b>acid</b> consumption and <b>reflux</b> time were investigated. The decomposition of tungsten residue using concentrated hydrochloric <b>acid</b> by <b>reflux</b> {{was compared to}} non-reflux. The {{results show that the}} reflux method is significantly better than the non-reflux method. The optimum decomposition conditions for tungsten residue are that the hydrochloric acid consumption is at 38. 55 mmol/g and the mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and tungsten residue are heated to reflux under stirring for 4 h. The decomposition ratio is Fe 98. 88 %...|$|R
40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether the newborn lamb at term is a valid model for studying gastroesophageal reflux. Seven bottle-fed lambs, ages 2 to 3 days, underwent esophageal multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH monitoring (MII-pH). A total of 196 reflux episodes were recorded, including 73 % alkaline and 27 % weakly acidic. No <b>acid</b> <b>refluxes</b> were observed. Median bolus clearance time was 4   seconds (3; 5. 5), and proximal reflux extent was 35 % (26). This first report of MII-pH in the newborn mammal sets the foundations for future studies with physiological and clinical relevance to human neonates...|$|R
50|$|Heartburn {{is usually}} due to {{regurgitation}} of gastric <b>acid</b> (gastric <b>reflux)</b> into the esophagus {{and is the}} major symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In about 0.6% of cases it {{is a symptom of}} ischemic heart disease.|$|R
25|$|Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), {{also known}} as <b>acid</b> <b>reflux,</b> is a {{long-term}} condition where stomach contents come back up into the esophagus resulting in either symptoms or complications. Symptoms include the taste of acid {{in the back of}} the mouth, heartburn, bad breath, chest pain, vomiting, breathing problems, and wearing away of the teeth. Complications include esophagitis, esophageal strictures, and Barrett's esophagus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acid</b> <b>reflux,</b> or {{gastroesophageal}} reflux disease, {{can greatly}} exacerbate the mouth-alcohol problem. The stomach is normally {{separated from the}} throat by a valve, but when this valve becomes herniated, {{there is nothing to}} stop the liquid contents in the stomach from rising and permeating the esophagus and mouth. The contents—including any alcohol—are then later exhaled into the breathalyzer. One study of 10 individuals suffering from this condition did not find any actual increase in Breath Ethanol.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{surgical treatment}} for severe GERD is the Nissen fundoplication. In this procedure, {{the upper part}} of the stomach is wrapped around the lower esophageal sphincter to strengthen the sphincter and prevent <b>acid</b> <b>reflux</b> and to repair a hiatal hernia. It is recommended only for those who do not improve with PPIs. Quality of life is improved in the short term compared to medical therapy, but there is uncertainty in the benefits over surgery versus long-term medical management with proton pump inhibitors. When comparing different fundoplication techniques, partial posterior fundoplication surgery is more effective than partial anterior fundoplication surgery, and partial fundoplication has better outcomes than total fundoplication.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 A {{method for}} the {{determination}} of selenium in biological materials by gas-liquid chromatography has been developed and successfully applied to kidney, heart, liver, and muscle tissue. The initial digestion of animal tissue was accomplished {{in a mixture of}} nitric and perchloric acids (3 : 1) until "water whiteness" of solution was achieved. It was found that an additional two to four hours severe heating was necessary to destroy the last traces of organic matter. No selenium was lost in this process but some was oxidized in Se(VI) and had to be reduced by <b>acid</b> <b>refluxing</b> in strong HC 1. The selenite was quantitatively complexed with 4 -chloro-ophenylenediamine at pH = 1. 0 to 1. 5. The 5 -chloropiaselenol formed was extracted into one ml of toluene and chromatographed on 3...|$|R

25|$|The {{two main}} sub-types {{of the disease}} are esophageal squamous-cell {{carcinoma}} (often abbreviated to ESCC), which {{is more common in}} the developing world, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), which is more common in the developed world. A number of less common types also occur. Squamous-cell carcinoma arises from the epithelial cells that line the esophagus. Adenocarcinoma arises from glandular cells present in the lower third of the esophagus, often where they have already transformed to intestinal cell type (a condition known as Barrett's esophagus). Causes of the squamous-cell type include tobacco, alcohol, very hot drinks, poor diet, and chewing betel nut. The most common causes of the adenocarcinoma type are smoking tobacco, obesity, and <b>acid</b> <b>reflux.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{long-term}} erosive {{effects of}} <b>acid</b> <b>reflux</b> (an extremely common condition, {{also known as}} gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD) have been strongly linked {{to this type of}} cancer. Longstanding GERD can induce a change of cell type in the lower portion of the esophagus in response to erosion of its squamous lining. This phenomenon, known as Barrett's esophagus, seems to appear about 20 years later in women than in men, maybe due to hormonal factors. Having symptomatic GERD or bile reflux makes Barrett's esophagus more likely, which in turn raises the risk of further changes that can ultimately lead to adenocarcinoma. The risk of developing adenocarcinoma in the presence of Barrett's esophagus is unclear, and may in the past have been overestimated.|$|E

40|$|Traditional carbon {{nanotube}} purification process involves nitric <b>acid</b> <b>refluxing</b> and cross flow filtration using surfactant TritonX. This {{is believed to}} result in damage to nanotubes and surfactant residue on nanotube surface. Alternative purification procedures involving solvent extraction, thermal zone refining and nitric acid refiuxing {{are used in the}} current study. The effect of duration and type of solvent to dissolve impurities including fullerenes and P ACs (polyaromatic compounds) are monitored by nuclear magnetic reasonance, high performance liquid chromatography, and thermogravimetric analysis. Thermal zone refining yielded sample areas rich in nanotubes as seen by scanning electric microscopy. Refluxing in boiling nitric acid seem to improve the nanotube content. Different procedural steps are needed to purify samples produced by laser process compared to arc process. These alternative methods of nanotube purification will be presented along with results from supporting analytical techniques...|$|R
40|$|Surfactant {{removal from}} the surface of platinum-based {{nanoparticles}} prepared using solution-based methods is a prerequisite to realize their high catalytic performance for electrochemical reactions. Herein, we report an effective approach combining acetic <b>acid</b> <b>refluxing</b> with an electrochemical process for the removal of amine-or thiol-based capping agents {{from the surface}} of supported-platinum nanoparticles. This strategy involves surfactant protonation by refluxing the supported-platinum particles in acetic acid followed by surfactant removal by subsequent electrochemical treatment at high potential. We demonstrate that this combined activation process is essential to enhance platinum particle performance in catalyzing direct methanol fuel cell reactions, including methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions. The studies in this work show promise in electrocatalysis applications of solution-based materials synthesis.
