5|$|Opinions {{criticizing the}} site rapidly spread {{throughout}} the blogosphere around early 2007. Schlafly appeared on radio programs Today on BBC Radio 4 and <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> <b>Considered</b> on NPR to discuss the site around that time. In May 2008, Schlafly {{and one of his}} homeschooled students appeared on the CBC program The Hour for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 Abu-Jamal {{published}} {{an essay in}} the Yale Law Journal, {{on the death penalty}} and his death row experience. In May 1994, Abu-Jamal was engaged by National Public Radio's <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> <b>Considered</b> program to deliver a series of monthly three-minute commentaries on crime and punishment. The broadcast plans and commercial arrangement were canceled following condemnations from, among others, the Fraternal Order of Police and US Senator Bob Dole (Kansas Republican Party). Abu-Jamal sued NPR for not airing his work, but a federal judge dismissed the suit. His commentaries later were published in May 1995 as part of Live from Death Row.|$|E
5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, {{what are we to}} make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It would be hard to have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. <b>All</b> <b>things</b> <b>considered,</b> it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E

50|$|<b>All</b> these <b>things</b> <b>considered,</b> a {{proposed}} biosynthetic pathway for brevetoxin class compounds {{begins with a}} traditional polyketide synthesis {{that has the potential}} to incorporate larger carbon units originating from acetate modified by the citric acid cycle. After the carbon backbone is synthesized, oxidation produces the necessary epoxides that lead to the closure of the multi-ring system. It is unclear if methyl groups as seen in BTX-B are added after cyclization or during the modification of the polyketide metabolites, {{but it is clear that}} methyl groups can originate from sources outside of acetate, such as S-adenosylmethionine.|$|R
50|$|In many {{traditions of}} modern Pagan cosmology, <b>all</b> <b>things</b> are <b>considered</b> to be cyclical, with {{time as a}} {{perpetual}} cycle of growth and retreat tied to the Sun's annual death and rebirth. This cycle is also viewed as a micro- and macrocosm of other life cycles in an immeasurable series of cycles composing the Universe. The days that fall on the landmarks of the yearly cycle traditionally mark the beginnings and middles of the four seasons. They are regarded with significance and host to major communal festivals. These eight festivals {{are the most common}} times for community celebrations.|$|R

40|$|Ibn ´Arabî (1165 - 1240) was {{responsible}} for systematizing Sufi thought, in which Neoplatonic philosophy is harmonized with elements of medieval astrological science, with Islamic mysticism, and with faith in Creation and the in Transcendence of God. Gnosticism and Docetism are also present in Ibn ´Arabî’s mysticism. He shares with other Sufis the notion that Oneness of Being is manifested and deployed in the Plurality of Creation. The concept of Divine Breath makes belief in Creation and the doctrine of Emanation compatible. <b>All</b> <b>things</b> are <b>considered</b> Words of God. Jesus becomes a paradigm of all Creation {{because he is the}} «embodiment» of the Merciful Breath exhaled over Mary by the angel Gabrie...|$|R
60|$|This old traveller’s pages abound {{with the}} {{information}} to be collected in a fresh field by an unscrupulous and hard-headed observer. They are of course disfigured with a little romancing. His Jews at Khaybor, near Al-Madinah, were five or six spans long. At Meccah he saw two unicorns, the younger “at the age of one yeare, and lyke a young coolte; the horne of this is of the length of four handfuls.[FN#6]” And so credulous is he about anthropophagi, that he relates of Mahumet (son to the Sultan of Sanaa) how he “by a certayne naturall tyrannye and madnesse delyteth to eate man’s fleeshe, and therefore secretly kylleth many to eate them.[FN#7]” But <b>all</b> <b>things</b> well <b>considered,</b> Lodovico Bartema, for correctness of observation and readiness of wit, stands in the foremost rank of the old Oriental travellers.|$|R

But {{he is a good}} letter writer at least, and we do not know if the Hughes man is even that. <b>All</b> <b>things</b> being <b>considered</b> I commend the Yankees. They have shown good sense and I do not mind admitting it. Cousin Sophia wanted them to elect Roosevelt, and is much disgruntled because they would not give him a chance.

60|$|So it was I had {{my first}} {{experience}} of the New Accelerator. Practically we had been running about and saying and doing <b>all</b> sorts of <b>things</b> {{in the space of}} a second or so of time. We had lived half an hour while the band had played, perhaps, two bars. But the effect it had upon us was that the whole world had stopped for our convenient inspection. <b>Considering</b> <b>all</b> <b>things,</b> and particularly <b>considering</b> our rashness in venturing out of the house, the experience might certainly have been much more disagreeable than it was. It showed, no doubt, that Gibberne has still much to learn before his preparation is a manageable convenience, but its practicability it certainly demonstrated beyond all cavil.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, The Tilted Wagon, as a cool {{establishment}} {{on the top}} of a hill, {{where the}} ground before the door was puddled with damp hoofs and trodden straw; where a scolding landlady slapped a moist baby (with one red sock on and one wanting), in the bar; where the cheese was cast aground upon a shelf, in company with a mouldy tablecloth and a green-handled knife, in a sort of cast-iron canoe; where the pale-faced bread shed tears of crumb over its shipwreck in another canoe; where the family linen, half washed and half dried, led a public life of lying about; where everything to drink was drunk out of mugs, and everything else was suggestive of a rhyme to mugs; The Tilted Wagon, <b>all</b> these <b>things</b> <b>considered,</b> hardly kept its painted promise of providing good entertainment for Man and Beast.

25|$|The {{blockade}} against Germany affected Denmark too with unfortunate results. Since {{the country}} has virtually no natural resources of its own it was very vulnerable to these price shocks and shortages. The government had foreseen the possibility of coal and oil shortages and had stockpiled some before the war, which, combined with rationing, prevented {{some of the worst}} potential problems from coming to the country. The disruptions to the European trading network were also damaging to the economy, but <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>considered,</b> Denmark did quite well compared to other countries during the war.|$|E

By 1996, Slug, Stress and Musab were making national appearances such as on NPR's <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> <b>Considered.</b> The start of Rhymesayers as a record label came when Siddiq, fed up with their treatment {{at a number of}} local studios, decided to buy his own.|$|E
5000|$|Shinto is {{considered}} to be at the fountain-head of Japanese culture. [...] With its emphasis on the wholeness of nature and character in ethics, and its celebration of the landscape, it sets the tone for Japanese aesthetics. Nevertheless, Japanese aesthetic ideals are most heavily influenced by Japanese Buddhism. In the Buddhist tradition, <b>all</b> <b>things</b> are <b>considered</b> as either evolving from or dissolving into nothingness. This [...] "nothingness" [...] is not empty space. It is rather a space of potentiality. If the seas represent potential then each thing is like a wave arising from it and returning to it. There are no permanent waves. At no point is a wave complete, even at its peak. Nature is seen as a dynamic whole that is to be admired and appreciated. This appreciation of nature has been fundamental to many Japanese aesthetic ideals, [...] "arts," [...] and other cultural elements. In this respect, the notion of [...] "art" [...] (or its conceptual equivalent) is also quite different from Western traditions (see Japanese art).|$|R
