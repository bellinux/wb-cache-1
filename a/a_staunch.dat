5|$|<b>A</b> <b>staunch</b> {{republican who}} deplored {{all forms of}} social privilege, {{including}} hereditary peerages, he accepted Kinnock's offer of {{a seat in the}} House of Lords with some reluctance, receiving a life peerage as Baron Dormand of Easington, of Easington in the County of Durham on 13 October 1987.|$|E
5|$|In July 1962, Algeria became {{independent}} of France. As <b>a</b> <b>staunch</b> {{political and financial}} supporter of the Algerian independence movement, Nasser considered the country's independence to be a personal victory. Amid these developments, a pro-Nasser clique in the Saudi royal family led by Prince Talal defected to Egypt, along with the Jordanian chief of staff, in early 1963.|$|E

50|$|Bekir Coşkun (born 1945 Tülmen, Şanlıurfa, Turkey) is a Turkish journalist, {{writer and}} {{columnist}} for leading Turkish daily, Cumhuriyet. He {{is a good}} friend of Emin Çölaşan, with whom he had worked in the newspaper Hürriyet before they were controversially sacked by the paper's editor-in-chief, Ertuğrul Özkök. <b>As</b> <b>staunch</b> secularists, both are critical of the Justice and Development Party.|$|R
5|$|It {{is likely}} that much of Morris's {{preference}} for medieval textiles was formed– or crystallised– during his brief apprenticeship with G. E. Street. Street had co-written a book on Ecclesiastical Embroidery in 1848, and was <b>a</b> <b>staunch</b> advocate of abandoning faddish woolen work on canvas in favour of more expressive embroidery techniques based on Opus Anglicanum, a surface embroidery technique popular in medieval England.|$|E
5|$|John treated his {{children}} equally within the home. He educated them {{in politics and}} social issues and exposed them to various politically important visitors. John's political work and ideology had a strong influence on Josephine, as did the religious teaching she received from her mother; the family background and the circles in which she moved formed a strong social conscience and <b>a</b> <b>staunch</b> religious faith.|$|E
5|$|On 29 April 1950, Charles {{dissolved}} parliament pending fresh elections. His {{intention was}} probably {{to prevent the}} formation of a PSC–CVP government under Van Zeeland, <b>a</b> <b>staunch</b> Leopoldist, which would lead to the return of the King without further discussion. The following election produced an absolute PSC–CVP majority in both Chamber and Senate, and a new single-party government under Jean Duvieusart was formed.|$|E

Fascinated by religious poetry, she founded a literary academy and was also a patron of musical theater. As Holy Roman Empress, she promoted the development of cultural and spiritual life at the Imperial court in Vienna, and despite being <b>an</b> <b>staunch</b> Catholic and benefactress of several monasteries, she had a tolerant attitude towards the Protestantism.|$|R
40|$|The book {{consists}} of an introduction and four stories by different authors. Two are war memories {{in the strict sense}} of the word. One officer and one soldier tell the everyday story of the war, highlighting all of its difficulties. The other two stories are life tales—the first is that of a young woman who voluntarily enlisted and later became <b>a</b> <b>staunched</b> communist; the second is that of a model Ukrainian workman who was called into service to serve the flag.

5|$|Pierlot {{was one of}} {{the chief}} {{supporters}} of the Benelux Customs Union negotiated with both the Dutch and Luxembourgish governments in exile and signed in September 1944.

5|$|Ramarayaningar was {{regarded}} as an advocate of democracy and <b>a</b> <b>staunch</b> supporter of empowerment of the depressed classes.

5|$|A {{graduate}} of the United States Military Academy, Devers was commissioned in the field artillery in 1909. During World War I, he was an instructor at the School of Fire at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and did not serve in France until after the November 11 armistice ended the fighting, when he attended the French artillery school at Treves. Between {{the two world wars}} he was <b>a</b> <b>staunch</b> advocate of mechanization {{at a time when the}} idea of phasing out horses met strong resistance from conservative gunners.|$|E

5|$|After Gia Long's death, Minh Mạng and Duyệt clashed frequently. As the {{southern}} governor, Duyet had significant autonomy, as only {{the centre of}} Vietnam was under direct royal rule. Duyet was a supporter of Catholic missionaries, while Minh Mạng was <b>a</b> <b>staunch</b> Confucianist. Duyet often disobeyed Minh Mạng's orders, and the emperor attempted to reduce the Duyet's autonomous power, which became easier with the general's death in 1831. The governor's post was abolished and the region was put under direct control.|$|E
5|$|Baseball {{historian}} Bill James {{does not}} dispute this claim in apparently referring to Speaker and possibly Cobb, but {{says that the}} Klan had toned down its racist overtures during the 1920s and pulled in {{hundreds of thousands of}} non-racist men, including Hugo Black. James adds that Speaker was <b>a</b> <b>staunch</b> supporter of Doby when he broke the American League color barrier, working long hours with the former second baseman on how to play the outfield.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, Bedell {{had decided to}} run for {{political}} office. In 1972, he ran against Wiley Mayne, a Republican incumbent in Iowa's 6th congressional district. Mayne was <b>a</b> <b>staunch</b> supporter of Richard Nixon and secured victory along with the President in a year favorable to the Republicans. Mayne, however, would politically suffer after Watergate (he was one of only a few Republicans to vote against impeaching the President on the judiciary committee.) The damage had already been done, and Bedell defeated Mayne in a 1974 rematch.|$|E
50|$|The {{organization}} however broke {{ties with}} the PNC in 1971, mainly because {{on the issue of}} government corruption, forcing the PNC to adopt <b>a</b> <b>stauncher</b> Black Nationalist course, while also igniting an oppositional, working class movement across the ethnic lines. ASCRIA itself initiated joint activities with Moses Bhagwan's pan-Indian Indian People's Revolutionary Associates (IPRA). The two groups came out to form the core of the nascent multiethnic pro-democracy movement. In 1974 ASCRIA and IPRA joined forces with the Maoist Working People's Vanguard Party and students groups Ratoon and Movement Against Oppression to form the Working People's Alliance.|$|R
5000|$|The Threipland {{family came}} from Peeblesshire and in about 1600 moved to Perthshire where they {{established}} <b>an</b> estate. <b>As</b> <b>staunch</b> {{supporters of the}} Stuarts, Sir David Threipland quickly joined the Jacobite cause during the '15 uprising. He was captured and became {{a prisoner of war}} and was forced into exile. In May 1716 his wife gave birth to a son, who they named after the cause they loyally supported, Stuart. The government forfeited the family estate and sold it to a private company who then leased it to Lady Threipland, allowing the family to continue living in reduced circumstances.|$|R

5|$|Davison was <b>a</b> <b>staunch</b> {{feminist and}} passionate Christian, and {{considered}} that socialism was {{a moral and}} political force for good. Much of her life has been interpreted through the manner of her death. She gave no prior explanation for what she planned {{to do at the}} Derby and the uncertainty of her motives and intentions has affected how she has been judged by history. Several theories have been put forward, including accident, suicide, or an attempt to pin a suffragette banner to the king's horse; none has ever been proven.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of the referendum, Walker was {{encouraged}} to stand for the Senate by a petition of over 6500 signatures. <b>A</b> <b>staunch</b> free trader, Walker campaigned as part of the Free Trade Party's endorsed ticket. He had resigned as president of the Bank of New South Wales in 1897, but remained a director. At the first federal election in March 1901, Walker was elected as a New South Wales Senator {{at the head of the}} poll.|$|E
5|$|He preached and lectured on the Immaculate Conception, {{and rose}} to {{seniority}} under the patronage of the Avignon Papacy and King Robert II of Scotland, becoming Bishop of Galloway and the only Franciscan to hold a Scottish bishopric. Thereafter he was <b>a</b> <b>staunch</b> advocate of Avignon Pope Clement VII against the English-backed Urban VI, for whom he engaged in partisan preaching and writing, famously challenging any English bishop to settle the issue by single combat.|$|E

During his service in the Senate, he defended a federal bank bill and opposed the annexation of Texas, though he supported the U.S.-Mexican War after it began. He was also <b>a</b> <b>staunch</b> supporter of fellow Kentuckian Henry Clay.|$|E
5|$|In April 1949, Truman {{appointed}} Radford to {{the position}} of Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. <b>A</b> <b>staunch</b> anticommunist, Radford saw the greatest threat to U.S. security coming from Asia, not Europe. He traveled extensively throughout the Pacific as well as South Asia and the Far East. He became acquainted with political and military leaders in New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaya, Burma, India, Pakistan, Hong Kong, Formosa, and Japan, and learned about the sociopolitical issues facing each nation and the region as a whole.|$|E
5|$|In the 970s, Haakon Sigurdsson, Jarl of Lade, {{became the}} most {{powerful}} man in Norway, at first supported by Harald Bluetooth of Denmark and paying tribute to him—though the two later fell out over religious matters.

In 995 Haakon was deposed and the young Christian leader Olaf Tryggvason came to the throne.|$|E
60|$|Ah! if {{they were}} all like her, {{if she were a}} {{representative}} of the whole nation of France, the young adventurer would have gone to his hazardous expedition with <b>a</b> <b>stauncher</b> and <b>a</b> lighter heart. But, as matters stood, what could he expect? What had he got as a serious asset in this gamble for life and a throne? A few vague promises from that flabby, weak-kneed creature over there on whom the crown of Saint Louis sat so strangely and so ill; a few smiles from that frivolous and vain woman, who drained the very heart's blood of an impoverished nation to its last drop, in order to satisfy her costly whims or chase away the frowns of ennui from the brow of an effete monarch.|$|R
