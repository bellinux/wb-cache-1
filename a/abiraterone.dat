25|$|<b>Abiraterone</b> acetate was FDA {{approved}} in April 2011 {{for treatment of}} castration-resistant prostate cancer for patients who have failed docetaxel therapy. <b>Abiraterone</b> acetate inhibits an enzyme known as CYP17, which {{is used in the}} body to produce testosterone.|$|E
25|$|The {{immunotherapy}} {{treatment with}} sipuleucel-T in CRPC increases survival by 4 months. The second line hormonal therapy <b>abiraterone</b> increases survival by 4.6 months {{when compared to}} placebo. Enzalutamide is another second line hormonal agent with a 5-month survival advantage over placebo. Both <b>abiraterone</b> and enzalutamide are currently being tested in clinical trials in those with CRPC who have not previously received chemotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{is able to}} {{significantly}} lower testosterone levels at high dosages in spite of not acting as an antigonadotropin, and this {{is thought to be}} due to direct enzymatic inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, enzymes necessary for the biosynthesis of testosterone. Although spironolactone {{is said to be a}} relatively weak inhibitor of 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, at least compared to more potent steroidogenesis inhibitors like ketoconazole and <b>abiraterone</b> acetate (which are able to reduce testosterone concentrations to castrate levels), this action is considered to contribute a significant portion of the antiandrogen effects of spironolactone, for instance lowering testosterone levels in women with hyperandrogenism and in transgender women.|$|E
2500|$|Oncology {{products}} include Velcade (bortezomib), for {{the treatment}} of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma and Zytiga (<b>abiraterone),</b> an androgen antagonist {{for the treatment}} of prostate cancer. [...] In clinical trials, <b>abiraterone</b> treatment was associated with a 4.6 to 5.2 survival advantage when used either before or after chemotherapy with platinum based drugs. On December 31, 2012, the Food and Drug Administration approved Sirturo (bedaquiline), a Johnson & Johnson tuberculosis drug that is the first new medicine to fight the infection in more than forty years.|$|E
2500|$|His {{survival}} {{beyond the}} approximate [...] "three month" [...] prognosis generated some controversy. It is believed that, following his release, Al-Megrahi was prescribed <b>abiraterone</b> and prednisone, a combination that extends median survival {{by an average}} of 14.8 months. After hospital treatment ended, he returned to his family home. Following his release, Megrahi published evidence on the Internet that was gathered for the abandoned second appeal which he claimed would clear his name.|$|E
2500|$|Palliative {{care for}} {{advanced}} stage prostate cancer focuses on extending life and relieving {{the symptoms of}} metastatic disease. As noted above, <b>abiraterone</b> is showing some promise in treating advance-stage prostate cancer. [...] It causes a dramatic reduction in PSA levels and tumor sizes in aggressive advanced-stage prostate cancer for 70% of patients. [...] Chemotherapy may be offered to slow disease progression and postpone symptoms. The most commonly used regimen combines the chemotherapeutic drug docetaxel with a corticosteroid such as prednisone. One study showed that treatment with docetaxel with prednisone prolonged life from 16.5 months for those taking mitoxantrone and prednisone to 18.9 months for those taking docetaxel + prednisone. Bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid {{have been shown to}} delay skeletal complications such as fractures or the need for radiation therapy in patients with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer. Xofigo is a new alpha emitting pharmaceutical targeting bone metastasis. The phase II testing shows prolonged patient survival times, reduced pain, and improved quality of life.|$|E
50|$|Δ4-Abiraterone (D4A; {{code name}} CB-7627), {{also known as}} 17-(3-pyridyl)androsta-4,16-dien-3-one, is a steroidogenesis {{inhibitor}} and active metabolite of <b>abiraterone</b> acetate, a drug which {{is used in the}} treatment of prostate cancer and is itself a prodrug of <b>abiraterone</b> (another active metabolite of <b>abiraterone</b> acetate). D4A is formed from <b>abiraterone</b> by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ5-4 isomerase (3β-HSD). It {{is said to be a}} more potent inhibitor of steroidogenesis than <b>abiraterone,</b> and is partially responsible for the activity of <b>abiraterone</b> acetate.|$|E
5000|$|... 3-Keto-5α-abiraterone, {{also known}} as 17-(3-pyridyl)-5α-androst-16-en-3-one, is an active {{metabolite}} of <b>abiraterone</b> acetate that {{has been found to}} possess androgenic activity and to stimulate prostate cancer progression. It is formed as follows: <b>abiraterone</b> acetate to <b>abiraterone</b> by esterases; <b>abiraterone</b> to Δ4-abiraterone by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ5-4 isomerase; and Δ4-abiraterone to 3-keto-5α-abiraterone by 5α-reductase. 3-Keto-5α-abiraterone may counteract the clinical effectiveness of <b>abiraterone</b> acetate, and so inhibition of its formation using the 5α-reductase inhibitor dutasteride is being investigated as an adjunct to <b>abiraterone</b> acetate in the treatment of prostate cancer.|$|E

50|$|<b>Abiraterone</b> (INN, BAN) (developmental {{code name}} CB-7598), {{also known as}} 17-(3-pyridyl)androsta-5,16-dien-3β-ol, is a synthetic, steroidal CYP17A1 inhibitor. It is the active {{metabolite}} of <b>abiraterone</b> acetate, an ester and prodrug of <b>abiraterone.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{metabolite}} of <b>abiraterone</b> {{has been}} found to act as an agonist of the androgen receptor, and may antagonize the clinical effectiveness of <b>abiraterone</b> acetate.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} {{interest}} {{in the use of}} <b>abiraterone</b> acetate for the treatment of breast cancer due to its ability to lower estrogen levels. However, <b>abiraterone</b> has recently been found to act as a direct agonist of the estrogen receptor, and induces proliferation of human breast cancer cells in vitro. If <b>abiraterone</b> acetate is used in the treatment of breast cancer, it should be combined with an estrogen receptor antagonist like fulvestrant. In spite of its antiandrogen and estrogenic properties, <b>abiraterone</b> acetate does not appear to produce gynecomastia as a side effect.|$|E
50|$|<b>Abiraterone</b> acetate, via its {{metabolite}} <b>abiraterone,</b> has {{the capacity}} to lower circulating testosterone levels to less than 1 ng/dL (i.e., undetectable), and these concentrations are much lower than those achieved by castration (20 ng/dL). The addition of <b>abiraterone</b> acetate to castration was found to reduce levels of DHT by 85%, DHEA by 97-98%, and androstenedione by 77-78% relative to castration alone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Abiraterone</b> acetate was FDA {{approved}} in April 2011 {{for treatment of}} castration-resistant prostate cancer for patients who have failed docetaxel therapy. <b>Abiraterone</b> acetate inhibits an enzyme known as CYP17, which {{is used in the}} body to produce testosterone.|$|E
50|$|The drug <b>abiraterone</b> acetate, {{which is}} used to treat castration-resistant {{prostate}} cancer, blocks the biosynthesis of androgens by inhibiting the CYP17A1 enzyme. <b>Abiraterone</b> acetate binds in the active site of the enzyme and coordinates the heme iron through its pyridine nitrogen, mimicking the subtrate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Abiraterone</b> acetate was {{approved}} by the United States Food and Drug Administration on April 28, 2011. The FDA press release made reference to a phase III clinical trial in which <b>abiraterone</b> use was associated with a median survival of 14.8 months versus 10.9 months with placebo; the study was stopped early because of the successful outcome.|$|E
50|$|A {{placebo-controlled}} double-blind randomized phase III {{study in}} patients with castration-refractory prostate cancer but who had not received chemotherapy opened to accrual in April 2009. 1,088 men received either <b>abiraterone</b> acetate (1000 mg daily) plus prednisone (5 mg twice daily), or placebo plus prednisone. The median radiographic progression-free survival was 16.5 months with <b>abiraterone</b> acetate-prednisone and 8.3 months with prednisone alone (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.45 to 0.62; P<0.001). After a median follow-up period of 22.2 months, overall survival was better with <b>abiraterone</b> acetate plus prednisone (median not reached) compared to placebo plus prednisone (27.2 months); HR = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.93; P=0.01).|$|E
50|$|<b>Abiraterone,</b> {{the active}} {{metabolite}} of <b>abiraterone</b> acetate, inhibits CYP17A1, which manifests as two enzymes, 17α-hydroxylase (IC50 = 2.5 nM) and 17,20-lyase (IC50 = 15 nM) (six-fold more selective for inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase over 17,20-lyase) that {{are expressed in}} testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissues. CYP17 catalyzes two sequential reactions: (a) the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17α-hydroxy derivatives by its 17α-hydroxylase activity, and (b) the subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, respectively, by its 17,20-lyase activity. DHEA and androstenedione are androgens and precursors of testosterone. Inhibition of CYP17 activity by <b>abiraterone</b> thus decreases circulating levels of androgens such as DHEA, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT).|$|E
50|$|The {{immunotherapy}} {{treatment with}} sipuleucel-T in CRPC increases survival by 4 months. The second line hormonal therapy <b>abiraterone</b> increases survival by 4.6 months {{when compared to}} placebo. Enzalutamide is another second line hormonal agent with a 5-month survival advantage over placebo. Both <b>abiraterone</b> and enzalutamide are currently being tested in clinical trials in those with CRPC who have not previously received chemotherapy.|$|E
50|$|Seviteronel is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen, acting {{specifically}} as an androgen synthesis inhibitor via {{inhibition of}} the enzyme CYP17A1, {{for the treatment}} of castration-resistant prostate cancer. It has approximately 10-fold selectivity for the inhibition of 17,20-lyase (IC50 = 69 nM) over 17α-hydroxylase (IC50 = 670 nM), which results in less interference with corticosteroid production relative to the approved CYP17A1 inhibitor <b>abiraterone</b> acetate (which must be administered in combination with prednisone to avoid glucocorticoid deficiency and mineralocorticoid excess due to 17α-hydroxylase inhibition) and hence may be administerable without a concomitant exogenous glucocorticoid. Seviteronel is 58-fold more selective for inhibition of 17,20-lyase than <b>abiraterone,</b> which has IC50 values for inhibition of 17,20-lyase and 17α-hydroxylase of 15 nM and 2.5 nM, respectively. In addition, in in vitro models, seviteronel appears to possess greater efficacy as an antiandrogen relative to <b>abiraterone.</b> Similarly to <b>abiraterone</b> acetate, seviteronel has also been found to act to some extent as an antagonist of the androgen receptor.|$|E

50|$|In {{conjunction}} with The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, the ICR tested a promising new prostate cancer drug called <b>abiraterone,</b> which it discovered and developed. A randomised placebo-controlled Phase III trial reported in October 2010 that <b>abiraterone</b> could extend survival in some men with late stage prostate cancer. The trial, funded by Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, included 1,195 patients from 13 countries whose advanced prostate cancer had stopped responding to standard therapies. <b>Abiraterone</b> extended the average overall survival of patients from 10.9 months to 14.8 months {{compared to a}} placebo, without many of the unpleasant side-effects associated with conventional chemotherapy. The FDA in April 2011 approved the drug {{for sale in the}} US under the trade name Zytiga.|$|E
50|$|Apalutamide may be {{effective}} in a subset of prostate cancer patients with acquired resistance to <b>abiraterone</b> acetate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Abiraterone</b> acetate (brand names Zytiga, Abiratas, Abretone, Abirapro) {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of prostate cancer. In addition to acting as an irreversible inhibitor of CYP17A1 (17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase), <b>abiraterone</b> inhibits 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD), steroid 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1), 5α-reductase (via a metabolite) and certain hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4). The drug acts as a partial antagonist of the androgen receptor and as an agonist of the estrogen receptor.|$|E
50|$|In {{accordance}} with its antiandrogen action, <b>abiraterone</b> acetate decreases the weights {{of the prostate}} gland, seminal vesicles, and testes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Abiraterone</b> also acts as {{a partial}} {{antagonist}} of the androgen receptor (AR), and as an inhibitor of the enzymes 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD), CYP11B1 (steroid 11β-hydroxylase), and other CYP450s (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4). In addition to <b>abiraterone</b> itself, part of {{the activity of the}} drug {{has been found to be}} due to a more potent active metabolite, Δ4-abiraterone (D4A), which is formed from <b>abiraterone</b> by 3β-HSD. D4A is an inhibitor of CYP17A1, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ5-4 isomerase, and 5α-reductase, and has also been found to act as a competitive antagonist of the AR reportedly comparable to the potent antagonist enzalutamide. However, the initial 5α-reduced metabolite of D4A, 3-keto-5α-abiraterone, is an agonist of the AR, and promotes prostate cancer progression. Its formation can be blocked by the coadministration of dutasteride, a potent and selective 5α-reductase inhibitor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Abiraterone</b> acetate is {{currently}} under {{development for the}} treatment of breast cancer and is in phase II clinical trials for this indication.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Abiraterone</b> acetate (INN, USAN, BAN, JAN) (brand names Zytiga, Abiratas, Abretone, Abirapro) is a steroidal CYP17A1 {{inhibitor}} and {{by extension}} androgen synthesis inhibitor which is used in combination with prednisone in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (previously called hormone-resistant or hormone-refractory prostate cancer) - i.e., prostate cancer not responding to androgen deprivation or treatment with androgen receptor antagonists. It is a prodrug to the active agent <b>abiraterone,</b> and is marketed by Janssen Biotech under the trade name Zytiga. In addition, Intas Pharmaceuticals markets the drug under the trade name [...] Abiratas, Cadila Pharmaceuticals markets the drug as Abretone, and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals as Abirapro.|$|E
50|$|A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of <b>Abiraterone</b> Acetate (CB7630) Plus Prednisone in Asymptomatic or Mildly Symptomatic Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer. The study {{began in}} April 2009 and is {{supported}} by Cougar Biotechnology.|$|E
50|$|After oral administration, <b>abiraterone</b> acetate, the prodrug {{form in the}} {{commercial}} preparation, is converted into the active form, <b>abiraterone.</b> This conversion {{is likely to be}} esterase-mediated and not CYP-mediated. Administration with food increases absorption of the drug and thus has the potential to result in increased and highly variable exposures; the drug should be consumed on an empty stomach at least one hour before or two hours after food. The drug is highly protein bound (>99%), and is metabolised in the liver by CYP3A4 and SULT2A1 to inactive metabolites. The drug is excreted in feces (~88%) and urine (~5%), and has a terminal half-life of 12 ± 5 hours.|$|E
50|$|<b>Abiraterone</b> acetate is {{indicated}} {{for use in}} combination with prednisone {{as a treatment for}} metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. It has received FDA (28 April 2011), EMA (23 September 2011), MHRA (5 September 2011) and TGA (1 March 2012) approval for this indication. In Australia it is covered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme when being used to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer and given in combination with prednisone/prednisolone (subject to the conditions that the patient is not currently receiving chemotherapy, is either resistant or intolerant of docetaxel, has a WHO performance status of <2, and his disease has not since become progressive since treatment with PBS-subsidised <b>abiraterone</b> acetate has commenced).|$|E
50|$|A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of <b>Abiraterone</b> Acetate (CB7630) Plus Prednisone in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Who Have Failed Docetaxel-Based Chemotherapy.

5000|$|Steroidal {{androgen}} synthesis inhibitors {{like the}} CYP17A1 inhibitor <b>abiraterone</b> acetate (Zytiga) or the 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride could also technically {{be described as}} [...] "SAAs", but the term is usually reserved to describe AR antagonists (and sometimes progestogenic antigonadotropins).|$|E
50|$|Inhibitors of {{cholesterol}} side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), such as aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole, may block production of all neurosteroids, both excitatory and inhibitory, while CYP17A1 (17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase) inhibitors, such as <b>abiraterone</b> acetate, may block production of excitatory neurosteroids. Antigonadotropins may also lower neurosteroid levels.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} methods of {{androgen}} deprivation therapy currently employed to treat prostate cancer are castration (with a GnRH analogue or orchiectomy), nonsteroidal antiandrogens, and the androgen synthesis inhibitor <b>abiraterone</b> acetate. Castration {{may be used}} alone or in combination {{with one of the}} other two treatments. When castration is combined with a nonsteroidal antiandrogen like bicalutamide, this strategy is referred to as combined androgen blockade (also known as complete or maximal androgen blockade). Enzalutamide and <b>abiraterone</b> acetate are specifically approved for use in combination with castration to treat advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer. Monotherapy with the nonsteroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide is also used in the treatment of prostate cancer as an alternative to castration with comparable effectiveness but with a different and potentially advantageous side effect profile.|$|E
