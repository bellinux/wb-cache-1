In west Sudan a white hibiscus flower is favoured for its bitter taste and is customarily served to guests.|$|R
50|$|Fruits {{are highly}} {{perishable}} so {{the ability to}} extract juices and store them was of significant value. Some fruits are highly acidic and mixing them with water <b>and</b> sugars <b>or</b> <b>honey</b> was often necessary to make them palatable. Early storage of fruit juices was labor-intensive, requiring the crushing of the fruits and the mixing of the resulting pure juices with sugars before bottling.|$|R

5000|$|Pandoro {{appeared}} in remote times, {{the product of}} the ancient art of breadmaking, as the name, Pan d'oro ("literally: Golden Bread"), suggests. Throughout the Middle Ages, white bread was consumed solely by the rich, while the common people could only afford black bread and, often, not even that. Sweet breads were reserved for nobility. Breads enriched with eggs, butter, <b>and</b> sugar <b>or</b> <b>honey</b> were served in the palaces and were known as [...] "royal bread" [...] or [...] "golden bread".|$|R
50|$|The {{pieces are}} poached by {{simmering}} with sliced ginger <b>and</b> sugar <b>or</b> <b>honey</b> {{over low heat}} until tender.

It can be served with a dash of yujajeub (유자즙, yuzu juice) mixed together. Baesuk is a seasonal food usually drunken cold just like other hwachae varieties but can be served hot.|$|R
5000|$|Before Monterey, Redding {{wanted to}} record with Conley, but Stax {{was against the}} idea. The two moved from Memphis to Macon to {{continue}} writing.

Sinai Hospital in New York to undergo surgery.|$|R
50|$|When the bunn has settled, more hot {{brewing liquor}} is poured onto the mash and the tap {{carefully}} opened. The wort, or lännu, is {{collected in a}} bucket under the tap. Brewing liquor can be added continuously to the bunn depending {{on the strength of}} lännu required. Sometimes the first lännu is kept separate as a stronger brew for special occasions, and the last used for everyday drinking. The collected lännu is boiled—the longer the boiling the sweeter the drikke—and additional flavoring such as hops <b>or</b> sweet gale <b>and</b> sugar <b>or</b> <b>honey</b> are added.|$|R

50|$|In entomology, {{the term}} brood {{is used to}} refer to the embryo or egg, the larva and the pupa stages in the life of {{holometabolous}} insects. The brood of honey bees develops within a bee hive. In man-made, removable frame hives, such as Langstroth hives, each frame which is mainly brood is called a brood frame. Brood frames usually have some pollen <b>and</b> nectar <b>or</b> <b>honey</b> in the upper corners of the frame. The rest of the brood frames cells may be empty or occupied by brood in various developmental stages. During the brood raising season, the bees may reuse the cells from which brood has emerged for additional brood or convert it to <b>honey</b> <b>or</b> pollen storage. Bees show remarkable flexibility in adapting cells to a use best suited for the hive's survival.|$|R
5000|$|By {{contrast}} with aguas frescas, {{which are made}} in advance and ladled from large jars, and other drinks such as refrescos and jugos, which are typically mass-produced and bottled, licuados are blended and made to order. [...] The main difference between a licuado and an American-style smoothie is that licuados use a milk base, whereas smoothies use fruit juice, sometimes in combination with sherbet or yogurt. [...] This makes them lower in calories, thinner, and higher in protein than most smoothies, especially important in the third-world state {{of many of the}} Latin American countries such as Honduras and Nicaragua. Licuados may also contain nuts (such as almonds <b>or</b> walnuts) <b>and</b> sugar <b>or</b> <b>honey.</b> Variants include adding granola or using chocolate instead of fruit.|$|R
50|$|A hot toddy is {{a mixture}} of a spirit (usually whiskey, rum, or brandy), hot water, <b>and</b> <b>honey</b> (<b>or,</b> in some recipes, sugar).

50|$|Apis cerana, <b>or</b> {{the eastern}} <b>honey</b> bee (and the Asiatic honey bee), is {{a species of}} honey bee found in {{southern}} and southeastern Asia, including China, Pakistan, India, Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Bangladesh, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Australia. This species is the sister species of Apis koschevnikovi, and both {{are in the same}} subgenus as the western (European) honey bee, Apis mellifera. A. cerana is known to live sympatrically as well with Apis koschevnikovi within the same geographic location. Apis cerana colonies are known for building nests consisting of multiple combs in cavities containing a small entrance, presumably for defense against invasion by individuals of another nest. The diet of this honey bee species consists mostly of pollen <b>and</b> nectar, <b>or</b> <b>honey.</b> Moreover, Apis cerana is known for its highly social behavior, reflective of its classification as a type of honey bee.|$|R
50|$|The word teriyaki {{derives from}} the noun teri (照り), which refers to a shine or luster given by the sugar content in the tare (タレ), and yaki (焼き), which refers to the cooking method of {{grilling}} or broiling. Traditionally the meat is dipped in or brushed with sauce several times during cooking. This popular dish was originally created by Japanese cooks of the seventeenth century, when urbanization, changes in agricultural methods and exposure to new ingredients from abroad gave rise to new, innovative cooking styles. The tare (タレ) is traditionally made by mixing and heating soy sauce <b>and</b> sake (<b>or</b> mirin) <b>and</b> sugar (<b>or</b> <b>honey).</b> The sauce is boiled and reduced to the desired thickness, then used to marinate meat, which is then grilled or broiled. Sometimes ginger is added and the final dish may be garnished with spring onions.|$|R

50|$|Sesame halva {{is popular}} in the Balkans, Poland, Middle East, and other areas {{surrounding}} the Mediterranean Sea. The primary ingredients in this confection are sesame butter <b>or</b> paste (tahini), <b>and</b> sugar, glucose <b>or</b> <b>honey.</b> Soapwort (called ‘erq al halaweh in Arabic; çöven in Turkish), egg white, or marshmallow root are added in some recipes to stabilize the oils in the mixture or create a distinctive texture for the resulting confection. A version of sesame halva, called sesame crumble candy (芝麻酥糖) in China uses ground sesame and sugar, cooked to the hard ball stage because it is made crispier than other halvas.|$|R
5000|$|Bappir was a Sumerian twice-baked {{barley bread}} that was {{primarily}} used in ancient Mesopotamian beer brewing. Historical research done at Anchor Brewing Co. in 1989 (documented in Charlie Papazian's Home Brewer's Companion (...) [...] ) reconstructed a bread made from malted barley and barley flour with honey {{and water and}} baked until hard enough to store {{for long periods of}} time; the finished product was probably crumbled and mixed with water, malt <b>and</b> either dates <b>or</b> <b>honey</b> <b>and</b> allowed to ferment, producing a somewhat sweet brew. It seems to have been drunk with a straw in the manner that yerba mate is drunk now.|$|R
5000|$|In North America, {{smoked salmon}} {{is likely to}} be sliced very thinly and served on bread with cream cheese or with sliced red onion, lemon and capers.

50|$|Nothing {{is known}} of their lives except that they {{suffered}} martyrdom in Syria during the persecution of the Emperor Diocletian. According to Christian traditions, the twin brothers were born in Arabia and became skilled doctors. Saladino d'Ascoli, a 15th century Italian physician, claims that the medieval electuary, a pasty mass consisting of a drug mixed with sugar <b>and</b> water <b>or</b> <b>honey</b> suitable for oral administration, known as opopira, a complex compound medicine used to treat diverse maladies including paralysis, was invented by Cosmas and Damian. During the persecution under Diocletian, Cosmas and Damian were arrested by order of the Prefect of Cilicia, one Lysias who is otherwise unknown, who ordered them under torture to recant. However, according to legend they stayed true to their faith, enduring being hung on a cross, stoned and shot by arrows and finally suffered execution by beheading. Anthimus, Leontius and Euprepius, their younger brothers, who were inseparable from them throughout life, shared in their martyrdom.|$|R
