25|$|Airline unions fought Lorenzo and Continental <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>step.</b> In the Federal courts, they un{{successful}}ly sued to {{stop the}} company's reorganization. They were successful in working to persuade Congress to pass a new bankruptcy law preventing bankrupt companies from terminating contracts as Continental had successfully done, but the law {{was too late to}} affect Continental. Lorenzo took Continental into Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 23, 1983, after unsuccessfully attempting to negotiate a lower pay rate with labor unions. Chapter 11 saved the company from liquidation, but required substantial reorganization, which began immediately. Following bankruptcy, Continental was freed of its contractual obligations and imposed a series of new labor agreements on its union workers, sharply reducing the airline's labor costs. Continental became vastly more competitive with the new airline startups then emerging and thriving in the southwestern U.S., but employee attitudes and loyalty were adversely affected. By the end of 1984, Continental recorded a $50million profit. Pilots went on strike in 1983, but were unsuccessful due to Continental pilots and new hires who crossed the picket line.|$|E

25|$|Other than {{counting}} {{the number of}} ions crossing the channel, sometimes it is desirable to study their behavior at different regions of the channel. Such examples would be the average occupancy of ions or their average moving velocity inside the channel or a nanopore. BioMOCA has been equipped with the option of dumping every ions position, average and instantaneous velocities, potential and kinetic energies, average and instantaneous displacements and other info <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>step</b> (or few steps) of the simulations in ASCII format, so such trajectory information could be studied later on to gather further statistics. From a technical point of view however, dumping such information for tens of ions, even at every few hundreds of time steps, could slow down the simulations and end up with huge files accumulating to tens of gigabytes. Loading such files later on from disk storage is also a very time consuming and computationally inefficient procedure. Over and above that, recoding the numerical information in ASCII format does not hold its machine precision and has loss of accuracy.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{decrease}} the fluid drag on an underwater robot manipulator, an optimal trajectory method based on the variational method is presented. By introducing the adjoint variables, which are Lagrange multipliers, we formulate a Lagrange function under certain constraints related to the target angle, target angular velocity, and dynamic equation of the robot manipulator. The state equation (the partial differentiation of the Lagrange function {{with respect to the}} state variables), adjoint equation (the partial differentiation of the Lagrange function with respect to the adjoint variables), and sensitivity equation (the partial differentiation of the Lagrange function with respect to torques) can be derived from the stationary conditions of the Lagrange function. Using the state equation, we can calculate the state variables (angles, angular velocities, and angular acceleration) <b>at</b> <b>every</b> time <b>step</b> in the forward time direction. These state variables are stored as data <b>at</b> <b>every</b> time <b>step.</b> Next, by using the adjoint equation, we can calculate the adjoint variables by using these state variables <b>at</b> <b>every</b> time <b>step</b> in the backward time direction. These adjoint variables are stored as data <b>at</b> <b>every</b> time <b>step.</b> Third, the sensitivity equation is calculated by using both the state variables and the adjoint variables. Finally, the optimal trajectory of the manipulator is obtained using the sensitivities. The proposed method is applied to the problem of two-link manipulators. It can obtain the optimal drag reduction trajectory of the manipulator under the constraints mentioned above...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{bidirectional}} recurrent {{neural network}} (BRNN) {{has been widely}} used for question answering (QA) tasks with promising performance. However, most existing BRNN models extract the information of questions and answers by directly using a pooling operation to generate the representation for loss or similarity calculation. Hence, these existing models don't put supervision (loss or similarity calculation) <b>at</b> <b>every</b> time <b>step,</b> which will lose some useful information. In this paper, we propose a novel BRNN model called full-time supervision based BRNN (FTS-BRNN), which can put supervision <b>at</b> <b>every</b> time <b>step.</b> Experiments on the factoid QA task show that our FTS-BRNN can outperform other baselines to achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy.
