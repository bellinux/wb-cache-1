5000|$|Traditionally, {{security}} appliances {{have been}} viewed as high performance products that may have had custom ASIC chips in it that allow for higher performance levels due to its dedicated hardware approach. Many vendors have started to call pre-built operating systems with dedicated applications on dedicated server hardware {{from the likes of}} IBM, Dell and offshore brands “appliances”. The appliance terminology although heavily used now has strayed from its original roots. An administrator would expect to see any underpinning Linux OS employ a monolithic kernel since the hardware platform is presumably static and vendor-controlled. However, the following examples are configured to use loadable kernel modules, reflecting the dynamic nature of the underlying hardware platforms used by product managers. [...] "Appliances" [...] have varying degrees of <b>administrative</b> <b>openness.</b> Enterasys Dragon version 7 IPS sensors (GE250 and GE500) are lightly hardened version of a Slackware Linux distribution, complete with administrative vulnerabilities, and shipping with anonymous root access the preferred method of administration of the underlying OS. Motorola AirDefense management consoles are shipped as an [...] "appliance" [...] without supported root access. Administrative setup tasks are performed via a textual menus running as an unprivileged user. Websense DSS sensor devices use CentOS 5.2 underneath and also allow root access at setup time. McAfee's older e-Policy Orchestator distributions use a RedHat 7 -based distribution, but modifications to typical OS configuration files are reset on reboot. Most of these devices primary configuration are via web interfaces. The implication that patches are not required for appliances is less accurate than the implication that vendors will be less apt to provide swift modular patches without complete reimaging of the devices. Companies such as NetScreen Technologies and TippingPoint defined security appliances by having dedicated hardware with custom ASIC chips in them to deliver high performing Firewall and Intrusion Prevention technology respectively. These companies defined there specific markets in the early 2000-2004 time frame.|$|E
40|$|The {{normative}} {{concept of}} transparency, {{along with the}} open government laws that purport to create a transparent public system of governance promise the world—a democratic and accountable state above all, and a peaceful, prosperous, and efficient one as well. But transparency, in its role as the theoretical justification {{for a set of}} legal commands, frustrates all parties affected by its ambiguities and abstractions. The public’s engagement with transparency in practice yields denials of reasonable requests for essential government information, as well as government meetings that occur behind closed doors. Meanwhile, state officials bemoan the significantly impaired decision-making processes that result from complying with transparency’s sweeping and powerful legal mandates, and complain about transparency’s enormous compliance costs. This article argues that the frustrations with creating an open government originate in the concept of “transparency” itself, which fails to consider the tensions it conceals. The easy embrace of transparency as a basis for normative and utilitarian ends evades more difficult questions: When is transparency most important as an administrative norm? To what extent should an agency be held to that norm? Open government laws fall short in answering these questions because, relying on the assumptions of “transparency,” they typically operate at exceptionally high levels of abstraction. As a result, they establish both broad mandates for disclosure and broad authority for the exercise of a state privilege of non-disclosure, and they ultimately fail to produce an effective, mutually acceptable level of <b>administrative</b> <b>openness.</b> Transparency theory’s flaws result from a simplistic model of linear communication which assumes that information, once set free from the state that creates it, will produce an informed, engaged public that will hold officials accountable. To the extent that this model fails to describe accurately the state, government information, and the public, as well as the communications process of which they are component parts, it provides a flawed basis for open government laws. The article critiques the assumptions embedded in transparency theory and suggests an alternative approach to open government laws that would allow a more flexible, sensitive means to evaluate {{the costs and benefits of}} information disclosure. It also proposes institutional alternatives to the current default regime in open government laws, which relies on weak judicial enforcement of disclosure mandates, and offers substantive suggestions that would improve efforts to establish a more accountable state and informed public...|$|E
40|$|Politische, wirtschaftliche und gesellschaftliche Transparenz ist sowohl auf nationaler und supranationaler als auch internationaler Ebene für das Funktionieren der pluralistisch-liberalen Demokratie von größter Wichtigkeit. Rechtliche Entscheidungen, Verwaltungsprozesse und politische Entwicklungen müssen einsichtbar sein. Direkt verbunden damit ist die Notwendigkeit offener politischer Kommunikation. Versperrt man den Informationszugang oder vertritt eine Politik der Geheimhaltung, wird Misstrauen erzeugt und die Entfremdung zwischen dem Bürger und der Verwaltung gesteigert. Die Europäische Union hat beim Knüpfen des Kommunikationsnetzes zweifelsohne Fehler gemacht, die auch zur sinkenden Beliebtheit des institutionalisierten Europa beigetragen haben, was gerade nach der großen Europamotivation der Jahrzehnte davor besonders ins Auge springt. Nun muss sich die EU mit starker Kommunikation neu aufstellen, um eine neue europäische Öffentlichkeit mitzuerschaffen. Das erste Kapitel der Arbeit „Kommunikation und Öffentlichkeit im Wandel der Zeit“ modelliert eine Semantik des Begriffs Kommunikation, gibt mit der Dokumentation von „Flashlights“ der Kommunikationsgeschichte das vielfältige und beeindruckende Bild dieser Entwicklungen wieder, beschreibt die Facetten der Staatskommunikation und schafft mit einer Beurteilung der Kommunikation in der Moderne und der Mediengesellschaft einen Ausblick in die Zukunft. Das zweite Kapitel widmet sich dem Kernthema „Transparenz in der Europäischen Union“. Ein kurzer geschichtlicher Abriss bereitet in Kombination mit der Analyse von Geheimnisschutz, Demokratie und Rechtsstaatlichkeit sowie Öffentlichkeitserfordernissen des Rechtsstaates das Thema auf und führt zum Verständnis der Positivierungen der Transparenzregeln und rechtlichen Regelungsebenen der Transparenz in den Institutionen der Europäischen Union. Im dritten Kapitel wird das „Transparenzgebot als europäischer Rechtsgrundsatz: Art 15 AEUV“ definiert. Mit Art 255 EGV war schon davor eine bahnbrechende Rechtsentwicklung gegeben, die mit der Implementierung in die Vertragsgrundsätze von Lissabon als Nummer 15 unter den ersten zwanzig Artikeln einen auffallenden Transparenzhöhepunkt schuf. Dokumentenzugang ist das wesentlichste Element der Verwaltungsoffenheit. Begriffe, Grundsätze, Verfahren und Ausnahmen müssen dementsprechend rechtsdogmatisch analysiert und rechtspolitisch bewertet werden. Juristische Wegbegleiter für die Transparenz der Europäischen Union waren die Entscheidungen der europäischen Gerichte, von denen exemplarisch im vierten Kapitel „Judikatur“ die wichtigsten Fälle beleuchtet und bewertet werden. Obwohl auch einer maßvollen Vertraulichkeit, vor allem in heiklen Verfahrensstadien, Raum gegeben wurde, hatten die meisten Urteile wesentlich zur Pro-Transparenz-Entwicklung beigetragen und viele Tore mit der Kraft nüchterner Rechtsprechung aufgestoßen oder offen gehalten. Diese Dissertation behandelt in ihrem fünften Kapitel als zweites wichtiges Thema neben der Transparenz die „Kommunikation und Öffentlichkeitsarbeit der Europäischen Kommission“, die gemeinsam mit der proaktiven Seite der Transparenz das Duo einer aufgeschlossenen europäischen Öffentlichkeit bildet. Die EU sieht sich ja mit ihren Organen mit zahlreichen Problemen konfrontiert, denen der Versuch der dezidierten Umsetzung von Öffentlichkeitsarbeit unter partieller Federführung der Generaldirektion Kommunikation gegenübersteht. Zahlreiche in dieser Arbeit analysierte Mitteilungen, Pläne und Initiativen der Kommission dokumentieren dieses Bemühen. Das sechste und letzte Kapitel „Europäische Öffentlichkeit: Analyse und Reformvorschläge im Lichte von Art 15 AEUV“ formuliert die Gesamtbewertung und den Zukunftsblick mit neuen Ideen: Transparent Governance als Teil von Good Governance, eine sinnvolle Symbiose von Öffentlichkeit und Geheimnisschutz, keine Parallelwelten durch Transparenzvorschriften, Transparenz als Bürgerpartizipation und offene Begegnung zwischen Bevölkerung und Verwaltung, noch klarere Regeln für den Dokumentenzugang und die scharfe Eingrenzung von Ausnahmen, schließlich einen „Transparent Governance Codex“ und Bürgerselbstbewusstsein durch Transparenz. Meine Erkenntnisse bündle ich zu einem „Plan E“, einer Europäischen Öffentlichkeit durch integrierte Kommunikation und „Transparent Governance“: Pro-aktiv, institutionell verankert und durchsetzbar, regionalisiert und doch europäisch, unter Einbeziehung klassischer und neuer Medien sowie einer Umsetzung durch eine Reformoffensive mit politischem und rechtlichem Gestaltungswillen. Zuhören, Kommunizieren, Regionalisieren, Europäisieren sind die vier Säulen einer neuen europäischen Öffentlichkeit., {{economic}} and social transparency is, both at the national, supranational and international level, of highest importance for the functioning of a pluralistic-liberal democracy. Legal decisions, administrative processes and political developments must be transparent. Directly connected with this fact {{is the need for}} open political communication. If access to information is blocked or a policy of secrecy is pursued, distrust will be created together with the estrangement of citizens and the administration. Regarding communication, the European Union has without doubt made mistakes, which also led to a decreasing popularity of the institutional Europe. This is particularly striking when viewed against the backdrop of high European motivation in previous decades. The EU has to position itself anew with strong communication to build a new European public sphere. The first chapter of the paper “Communication and Publicity in changing times“ defines semantics of the term “communication” and illustrates this with “flashlights“ of communication history. The multifarious and impressive image of these developments describes the facets of communication of States and offers a future prospect on communication in modern times and the media society. The second chapter dedicates itself to the core topic “Transparency in the European Union“. A brief historical summary introduces the topic in combination with an analysis of the protection of confidential information, democracy {{and the rule of law}} and the need for publicity for the State, with a view to making the various types of transparency rules and regulatory framework in the institutions of the EU understandable. The third chapter is dedicated to the “Transparency requirement as a European legal principle: Art 15 TFEU“. Prior to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty (Treaty on the functioning of the European Union, TFEU) there was the groundbreaking legal development with Art 255 TEC (Treaty establishing the European Community), which accomplished an outstanding transparency milestone through the implementation of Art 15 under the first twenty articles of the principles of the TFEU. Access to documents is the most important element of <b>administrative</b> <b>openness.</b> Definitions, terms, principles, procedures and exceptions have to be analysed according to legal doctrine and interpreted in view of legal policy. Judicial drivers for the transparency of the European Union were the decisions of the European courts. Through examples in the fourth chapter “Jurisdiction“ the most important cases are highlighted and evaluated. Although there was space given to moderate confidentiality, especially in delicate stages of procedure, most judgements contributed to the development of pro-transparency and opened many doors with the strength of pragmatic decision making. This dissertation deals in its fifth chapter with the second important topic besides transparency “Communication and public relations of the European Commission“, which contributes with the pro-active side of transparency to an open-minded European public sphere. The EU with its institutions is confronted with many problems, and is faced with the need to realise solid public relations work under the partial leadership of the Directorate General Communications. Various action plans are analysed and initiatives of the Commission document this effort. The sixth and last chapter “European public: Analysis and proposals for reforms on the basis of Art 15 TFEU“ gives an overall evaluation and looks to the future with new ideas: Transparent governance as part of good governance, a reasonable symbiosis of public and confidential information, no parallel existence through exaggerated transparency regulations, transparency as civic participation and open-minded interaction between civil society and administration, even more clear regulations for the access of documents and carefully selected exceptions, finally a “Transparent Governance Codex“ and self-confidence of citizens through transparency. My findings are brought together into a “Plan E“, a European public domain founded on integrated communications and “Transparent Governance“: pro-active, institutionally and politically anchored, regional but at the same time European, involving classical and new media, and the implementation of a reform offensive with political and judicial emphasis on design and creation. Listening, communicating, regionalising, Europeanising are the four pillars of strength of a new European public sphere. ...|$|E

Taking as its starting point the evolution and expansion of Islamic educational institutions in contemporary Indonesia, particularly since the 1970 s, it examines the emergence of elite Islamic schools and identifies the unique characteristics that attract many urban, middle-class Muslims {{to send their children}} to these schools. In addition, this study attempts to address the lack of research on the history of Islamic education in Indonesia between the years 1970 and 2000. A review of past studies demonstrates that this period has not been critically examined enough. In looking at the specific example of Al Azhar Islamic High School, an evaluative case study and ethnographic techniques were employed. Interviews, observations, and fieldnotes served as primary resources. As the first elite Islamic school ever founded, it has distinguished itself as a pioneer in providing educational service especially to the urban Muslim society in Jakarta. My central research question was whether the changes that had occurred in the Islamic educational system following the introduction of elite or excellence-oriented schools had really lived up to expectations. More specifically, I inquired into the strengths and weaknesses of elite Islamic schools faced with the task of meeting ongoing and complex challenges in this era of globalization, while at the same time maintaining Islamic teachings and practices. However, this study found that there is still a gap between the ideals of the elite Islamic school and its ability to pursue its stated goals of education. The lack of human resources and poor communications between school community and government show that these schools have not yet achieved the highest quality standards. The study also reveals that the school has to adopt policies to promote transparency in the organizational and <b>administrative</b> spheres, <b>openness</b> to non-Muslims, and accessibility to other sections of society. This research makes a contribution to the fields of school reform and school effectiveness. Moreover, the study may also have implications for other social and religious contexts...|$|R

European {{administrative}} {{space is}} an informal acquis {{consisting of the}} standards and principles that regulate the organisation, functioning, and activities of public administration. The issue of creation of the European administrative space became increasingly important parallel with strengthening of the European integration process, which is somewhat contradictory to the claims that administrative traditions show remarkable resistance. The creation of the European administrative space {{is based on the}} idea that the administrative systems of European countries converge towards a common administrative model characterised by the principles of the rule of law, meaning legal certainty and predictability of <b>administrative</b> actions; <b>openness</b> and transparency; accountability; efficiency in the use of public resources and effectiveness in accomplishing the policy goals. The actions of the European Court of Justice and the European Commission are of particular importance to the creation of the European administrative space, together with the formulation of the accession criteria for candidate countries and stimulation of administrative reforms oriented towards strengthening of the institutional capacity. The contacts of administrative personnel at the European level and the influence of globalisation and administrative doctrines are also important for mutual »infection« of national public administrations. SIGMA has a special role in the development of the EAS concept. Harmonisation and convergence of national public administrations, with simultaneous retention of national traditions, leads to the conclusion that the beginnings of the European administrative space really exist. However, it is not yet possible to discern the formation of a complex and minutely developed public administration model that ought to be implemented by the member states and candidate countries. The European administrative space is probably going to be a set of rules and standards with gradually increasing corpus...|$|R
