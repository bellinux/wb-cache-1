40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is, in part, to {{illustrate}} and educate what forensic accountants do and how they do it with a step-by-step process. It demonstrates the kinds of simple research in which forensic accountants should engage and should help educate forensic accountants in the use of one of the basic tools of investigation – public records research using databases that are freely available. More information can, of course, be obtained from fee-based services, but one does not have to use fee-based services. This research can serve as a basis for showing forensic accountants where to look, what to look for, how to assemble various documents to tell a story, and how to arrive at conclusions based on the evidence obtained. Conducting a forensic accounting investigation typically leads to more questions as more facts are uncovered, which then leads the forensic accountant down other paths to discover other facts, and so forth, until a more complete picture is formed. This approach uses the American Accounting Association (AAA) as an example, looking at the AAA from a forensic accountant’s viewpoint. In spite of the term, forensic accounting is not all accounting and numbers. A forensic accountant gathers evidence just as auditors gather evidence to support an opinion. The Third Standard of Field Work for CPAs states, “The auditor must obtain sufficient <b>appropriate</b> <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> ” on which to base an opinion (AU Section 508 2011). In fact, a qualified opinion must be issued if “there is a lack of sufficient <b>appropriate</b> <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> ” (AU Section 508 2011). * The Executive Director and the current and next presidents were invited to respond to this article, but no response was forthcoming...|$|E
40|$|Recent European reforms on audit {{regulations}} have been motivated by {{efforts to increase}} audit quality, functioning and performance. We believe the adoption of Directive 2014 / 56 and Regulation 537 / 2014 strengthened the role of independent audit and risk committees, which will positively contribute towards audit quality. This paper aims to critically assess the status quo of audit risk assessment in current European standards and regulations, by conducting a theoretical analysis of different aspects of audit risk. Our main objective is to {{stress the importance of}} detecting inherent and control risk, which lead to material misstatement at the assertion level. They need to be assessed so as to determine the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures necessary to obtain sufficient <b>appropriate</b> <b>audit</b> <b>evidence.</b> These pieces of evidence enable the auditor to express an opinion on the financial statements at an acceptably low level of audit risk.

40|$|In auditing, {{professional}} skepticism {{refers to}} an attitude that requires ongoing questioning and critical assessment of evidence. An auditor needs to exercise professional skepticism to obtain sufficient and <b>appropriate</b> <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> to determine whether financial statements are free from material misstatements due to errors or frauds. Hurtt (2010) developed a professional skepticism scale to measure the level of an auditor’s skepticism. However, the exercise of professional skepticism among auditors is very subjective and difficult to measure. The validity of the Hurtt skepticism scale {{in the context of}} different countries requires further examination. A factor analysis study is conducted to validate the suitability of the instrument based on Malaysian data. The results indicate that only five of the Hurtt (2010) skepticism traits are relevant in determining professional skepticism in the Malaysian environment. The suspension of judgment trait seems to be irrelevant since respondents feel that this trait requires more time to make audit decisions and may delay audit work. Malaysian auditors are not likely to possess such a trait because they are burdened with numerous audit tasks that must be completed by a deadline. The results suggest that variances may exist across different countries due to differences in environment...|$|E

40|$|According to The International Standards on Auditing, {{the purpose}} of the auditor in an audit {{engagement}} is to express an independent, objective and a professional opinion regarding the accuracy of the financial statements of the companies audited. During his mission, the auditors must also assess the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, with a major impact on the preparation and the quality of financial statements that are reported. To support his opinion, regarding the hypothesis of going concern, the auditor must obtain sufficient and <b>appropriate</b> <b>audit</b> <b>evidence,</b> and perform the necessary audit procedures. For that, analytical procedures ensure a series of comparative information at the level of analyzed periods or branch, useful to the auditor in the audit engagement. The present study aims to obtain a deterministic model based on duration models, for assessing the audited companies’ ability to continue as a going concern. The research results are useful to the auditor in the assessment of the audited company’s compliance with the going concern assumption, in preparation of financial statements.

40|$|Reporting on {{performance}} was legislatively established in South Africa {{in terms of}} the Public Finance Management Act, Act 1 of 1999, section 40 (3) (a). The auditing of the reported information was legislated in the Public Audit Act, Act 25 of 2004, section 20 (2) (c). The objectives of the article are firstly to provide an overview of the development and application of the reporting and secondly providing assurance on service delivery information and thirdly to reflect on challenges to the implementation thereof in South Africa. The aim through deploying these set objectives is to formulate possible future considerations for improved governance. As central part of the methodology, review of literature on reporting and audit of non-financialwas conducted. The research included scrutiny of the different philosophies and approaches adopted by different countries to the reporting and providing assurance on service delivery information.

40|$|This study {{examines}} evidence selection strategy among external auditors (i. e. professionals) and accounting students (i. e. novices) in a going concern assessment task considering three factors; hypothesis framing, prior expectation and professional “trait” scepticism {{as measured by}} Hurtt (2010) scale. Within this context, the study sets out to accomplish three goals: (1) to re-examine evidence selection strategy based on hypothesis framing and prior expectation, (2) to validate the Hurtt (2010) scale using expert reviews and confirmatory factor analysis and (3) to investigate whether professional trait scepticism influences selection strategy. Owing to the incidence of high-profile accounting and auditing scandals worldwide, the regulatory bodies identified {{that two of the}} top five areas that contributed to audit deficiencies are: (a) failure to gather sufficient <b>appropriate</b> <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> and (b) insufficient level of professional scepticism. However, it is to be noted that the regulatory bodies did not specify how professional scepticism is to be measured. As a result, researchers across the globe explored this concept and tried to understand what factors influence professional scepticism and how it can be measured. One of the factors was identified as the trait of an individual that affects professional scepticism. Other factors include incentives, knowledge and audit experience. This study was motivated by the fact that limited research has been conducted to date to understand the effect of trait scepticism on auditors’ behaviour. Accounting students were chosen to understand the influence of trait scepticism unaffected by audit experience. The result reconfirmed previous research findings that auditors across junior to partner level exhibit disconfirmation selection behaviour mainly because of sensitivity to the potential loss function for not identifying a failed firm whereas students exhibit confirmatory selection behaviour indicating they are not so sensitised to the loss function that may be due to lack of real audit experience. This study also validates the Hurtt (2010) 30 item scale and reduces the scale to 16 items to have a good model fit. With the reduced 16 item scale, trait scepticism was measured for individual auditors and students and the study found that trait scepticism had an effect on evidence search among students but only a marginally effect among auditors. The result {{may be due to the}} fact that although devoid of practical audit experience students are aware of the concept of professional scepticism and going concern assessment as these concepts are taught in their curriculum, hence were primed to the task and approached it cautiously. For the auditors, it may be the task did not motivate them to exhibit enough scepticism as they are well versed in the nature of going concern assessment. Further, other factors (i. e. states or situations) such as accountability, incentives, knowledge and experience also influence their day-to-day work and, therefore, may be in combination with trait scepticism, be required to exhibit sceptical behaviour. However, after controlling the different situations formed by a combination of hypothesis framing and prior expectation, the results showed that trait scepticism influences evidence selected among auditors but not among students. The study contributes to existing auditing literature by validating the Hurtt (2010) scale and by investigating the impact of trait scepticism on selection strategy among students in an Australian university and external auditors based in the US. Further, this study explored the impact of hypothesis framing and prior expectation among students and re-examined the effect of hypothesis framing and prior expectation using auditor...|$|E

40|$|<b>Audit</b> <b>evidence</b> {{enables the}} auditor to express {{an opinion on}} the {{financial}} statements. To address {{the risk that the}} auditor may express an inappropriate opinion, the nature, timing and extent of audit procedures must be responsive to the assessed risks of material misstatement. The auditor must aggregate the levels of assurance obtained from different combinations of tests of controls, substantive analytical procedures and tests of details to respond to the assessed risks. These evidence planning decisions are complex and require professional judgement. Research has found that the extent of audit procedures is not linked to the assessed risks and that auditors may not know to aggregate evidence from different types of audit procedures. Research also supports the use of a structured audit methodology that includes decision models, to guide the application of professional judgement. This leads to the overall objective of this study: the development of an integrated <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> planning model to quantify the extent of <b>audit</b> <b>evidence.</b> The study employs a grounded theory model building approach, interpreting the relevant concepts and principles from the literature review into the development of the model. The integrated <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> planning model quantitatively relates the extent of <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> in a logical and structured manner with the risk assessment and three distinct overall levels of assurance needed to support the audit opinion. It uses the cumulative nature of <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> and the compensatory inter-relationship between tests of controls, substantive analytical procedures and tests of details to quantitatively aggregate the extent and levels of assurance from the different combinations of procedures to obtain reasonable assurance at the required overall level of assurance. The model provides a framework for influencing and guiding the exercise of professional judgement and is a practical and effective tool to benefit the users thereof when conducting an audit. Thus, the study models the extent of <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> with reference to the aggregation of different types and combinations of evidence and the linkage between the risk assessment and the extent of evidence that provides a flexible framework for the application of professional judgement regarding the gathering of <b>audit</b> <b>evidence.</b> AuditingD.
