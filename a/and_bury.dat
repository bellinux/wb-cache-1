5|$|Osbert's lands were chiefly in Norfolk and Suffolk, but he {{also had}} some lands in Essex and some from the Count of Perche. Other lands were held from two monastic houses in East Anglia: St Benet Holme <b>and</b> <b>Bury</b> St Edmunds.|$|E
5|$|The Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal is a disused canal in Greater Manchester, England, {{built to}} link Bolton <b>and</b> <b>Bury</b> with Manchester. The canal, when fully opened, was 15miles 1furlong (24.3km) long. It was {{accessed}} via a junction with the River Irwell in Salford. Seventeen locks {{were required to}} climb to the summit as it passed through Pendleton, heading northwest to Prestolee before it split northwest to Bolton and northeast to Bury. Between Bolton <b>and</b> <b>Bury</b> the canal was level and required no locks. Six aqueducts were built to allow the canal to cross the rivers Irwell and Tonge and several minor roads.|$|E

5|$|Expecting an {{imminent}} {{continuation of the}} battle, three Allied brigades arrived within twenty-four hours to reinforce the beachhead, but no subsequent attack materialised. Instead, on 20 and 24 May two truces were declared to collect the wounded <b>and</b> <b>bury</b> the dead in no man's land. The Turks never succeeded in capturing the bridgehead; instead the ANZACs evacuated the position {{at the end of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|His {{body was}} cut down {{after an hour}} by the hangman, John Foxton, who claimed Corder's {{trousers}} and stockings according to his rights. The body was taken back to the courtroom at Shire Hall, where it was slit open along the abdomen to expose the muscles. The crowds were allowed to file past until six o'clock, when the doors were shut. According to the Norwich <b>and</b> <b>Bury</b> Post, over 5,000 people queued to see the body.|$|E

5|$|In Washington, D.C., Chris Whitley (Kris Lemche) {{is ordered}} by the conspirators who fund Juma's militia to erase all {{information}} that would incriminate them. Instead, he calls his friend Roger Taylor (Eric Lively), the son of President Elect Allison Taylor (Cherry Jones), for help. After Roger hears of the conspiracy, Whitley returns to his home to forward the files, only to be stopped by Hodges's men, Halcott and John Quinn (Sebastian Roche) who take the information, kill Whitley <b>and</b> <b>bury</b> the body in concrete.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth Argyle had {{finished}} the 199596 Football League season in fourth place in the Third Division, one place ahead of Darlington. Therefore, both missed out on the three automatic promotion places and instead {{took part in the}} play-offs to determine who would join Preston North End, Gillingham, <b>and</b> <b>Bury</b> as the fourth promoted team. On {{the final day of the}} league season, Plymouth Argyle had the opportunity to finish third in the table and thereby clinch the final automatic promotion place but a 30 win at Home Park against Hartlepool United was not enough to overtake Bury, after they also won 30 at home to Cardiff City.|$|E
5|$|The armies {{stared at}} {{one another in a}} heavy rain across the bloody fields on July 4, the same day that the Vicksburg {{garrison}} surrendered to Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. Lee had reformed his lines into a defensive position on Seminary Ridge the night of July 3, evacuating the town of Gettysburg. The Confederates remained on the battlefield, hoping that Meade would attack, but the cautious Union commander decided against the risk, a decision for which he would later be criticized. Both armies began to collect their remaining wounded <b>and</b> <b>bury</b> some of the dead. A proposal by Lee for a prisoner exchange was rejected by Meade.|$|E

5|$|The city's boundaries, {{set by the}} Local Government Act 1972, include five former local {{government}} districts. It is bounded on the south east by the River Irwell, which forms its boundary with the Manchester, and by the Manchester Ship Canal to the south, which forms its boundary with Trafford. The metropolitan boroughs of Wigan, Bolton <b>and</b> <b>Bury</b> lie to the west, northwest and north respectively. Some parts of the city, which lies directly west of Manchester, are highly industrialised and densely populated, but around {{one third of the}} city consists of rural open space. The western half of the city stretches across an ancient peat bog, Chat Moss.|$|E
5|$|The {{margin of}} the Empress Eudocia's copy of the Iliad has a note {{summarizing}} a Hellenistic poet who tells a different story of Orion's birth. Here the gods Zeus, Hermes, and Poseidon come to visit Hyrieus of Tanagra, who roasts a whole bull for them. When they offer him a favor, he asks {{for the birth of}} sons. The gods take the bull's hide and ejaculate or urinate into it <b>and</b> <b>bury</b> it in the earth, then tell him to dig it up ten months later. When he does, he finds Orion; this explains why Orion is earthborn.|$|E
5|$|The nearby hill forts of Figsbury Ring, Quarley Hill, <b>and</b> <b>Bury</b> Hill were {{probably}} established {{around the same}} time as Danebury. All of a similar size, the hillforts were generally equally spaced, commanding similar sized territories and resources. There is some debate whether hill forts were purely defensive structures, and to what extent they were occupied. Cunliffe interprets the ramparts as essentially defensive, although he concedes that they may have been a means of displaying wealth and power, as Danebury would have been visible for miles around.|$|E

60|$|And, indeed, this similitude {{by which}} he here reasoneth {{the manner of the}} resurrection of the just, is very natural, and fitly suiteth each particular; for, as to its burial--(1.) The corn of wheat is first dead, and after sown <b>and</b> <b>buried</b> in the earth; and so is the body of man. (2.) After the corn is thus dead <b>and</b> <b>buried,</b> then it quickeneth and reviveth to life: so also shall it be with our body; for after it is laid in the grave <b>and</b> <b>buried,</b> it shall then quicken, rise, and revive.|$|R
5|$|During the Late Period, a {{different}} form of worship involving animals developed. In this case, laymen paid the priests to kill, mummify, <b>and</b> <b>bury</b> an animal of a particular species as an offering to a god. These animals were not regarded as especially sacred, but as a species they {{were associated with the}} god because it was depicted in the form of that animal. The god Thoth, for instance, could be depicted as an ibis and as a baboon, and both ibises and baboons were given to him. Although this practice was distinct from the worship of single divine representatives, some temples kept stocks of animals that could be selected for either purpose. These practices produced large cemeteries of mummified animals, such as the catacombs around the Serapeum of Saqqara where the Apis bulls were buried along with millions of animal offerings.|$|E
5|$|Empress Shulü Ping, {{who became}} known as Empress Dowager Yingtian {{following}} the death of her husband, was an exceptionally powerful figure both before and after Taizu's death. While the latter was alive, Shulü Ping commanded an army of 200,000 horsemen that was tasked with maintaining order while Taizu led military campaigns abroad. She also led campaigns herself. Following the death of her husband, the Empress rejected the traditional Khitan custom of being buried with him, and elected to cut off her right hand <b>and</b> <b>bury</b> that with the Emperor instead. Shulü Ping then seized full military and civil authority in order to oversee the imperial succession under her own terms. The Empress's refusal to kill herself and be buried with Taizu effectively ended the longstanding custom.|$|E
5|$|Gobioolithus {{eggs were}} {{probably}} laid in open nests {{on the banks}} of ephemeral rivers or lakes, which could frequently flood the nesting areas <b>and</b> <b>bury</b> the eggs. The distribution of the eggs suggests that they had a long-term colonial nesting site at the Khermeen Tsav locality in the Barun Goyot Formation. At the Bayn-Dzak locality, the eggs are typically arranged in clutches, whereas elsewhere they are scattered randomly, each oriented nearly vertically in the substrate. The solitary eggs may have been laid and buried individually, similar to the nesting habits of modern megapodes. It is also possible that they were originally laid in clutches, but flooding separated them and deposited them vertically as the water level dropped. Water damage would also explain why Gobioolithus shells are frequently heavily recrystallized.|$|E

5|$|Pathways casts {{the player}} {{as a member}} of a US Army Special Forces team sent on a mission to the Yucatán Peninsula. On May 5, 1994, a diplomat from the alien Jjaro {{appeared}} to the President of the United States and informed him that on May 13, an ancient godlike being sleeping beneath a pyramid would awaken and destroy the Earth. The only way to prevent this catastrophe is to prevent the god from awakening. The eight-man Special Forces team carries a nuclear weapon, with the goal of entering the ancient pyramid, descending to the bottom level where the god sleeps, and activating the bomb to stun the god <b>and</b> <b>bury</b> it under tons of rock.|$|E
5|$|The {{bombing and}} {{strafing}} of native villages by the Allied Air Forces caused some 600 Goodenough Islanders {{to flee to}} Fergusson Island, where Timperley's ANGAU detachment {{had set up a}} refugee camp and was caring for them until the fighting was over and they could safely return. Australian losses on Goodenough Island were 13 killed in action or died of wounds, and 19 wounded. The Japanese suffered 20 killed and 15 wounded during the battle, but the 2/12th counted 39 dead. However, this was only an estimate as the Japanese had been able to retrieve <b>and</b> <b>bury</b> their dead, which had made it difficult for the Australians to accurately determine their casualties. Despite the evacuation, some Japanese were left behind. One was captured by islanders on 30 October and handed over to Timperley. Two died from malaria in November 1942, and another, Shigeki Yokota, evaded capture until he was taken prisoner in July 1943.|$|E
5|$|With {{the help}} of some miners, John and Kanyenke bring down large rock bridges to stop the Russians' large cannons from getting through. John then sends Kanyenke and the {{remainder}} of his mercenaries back east as he plants explosives to cause an avalanche <b>and</b> <b>bury</b> the Russians in the mountains. In the end, as John is setting up the dynamite, Warwick and several Boneguard approach him. Warwick attempts to kill John but John uses a barrel of gunpowder as a shield (knowing that Warwick won't risk detonating it by shooting at him), jumps to the trigger, and pushes it, detonating the mountainside; killing himself, the soldiers, and Warwick; and causing an avalanche. The avalanche buries the Russians and sets the Circle of Ossus back so far that they cause no problems for many years.|$|E
