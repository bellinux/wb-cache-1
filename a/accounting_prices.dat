He distinguished carefully between the values, exchange values, market values, market prices and prices of production of commodities. However he did not analyze all the different forms that prices can take (for example, market-driven prices, administered prices, <b>accounting</b> <b>prices,</b> negotiated and fixed prices, estimated prices, nominal prices, or inflation-adjusted prices) focusing mainly on the value proportions he thought to be central to the functioning of the capitalist mode of production as a social system. The effect of this omission was that debates about the relevance of Marx's value theory became confused, and that Marxists repeated the same ideas Marx himself had rejected as [...] "vulgar economics". In other words, they accepted a vulgar concept of price.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to discuss the {{possibility}} of using an interregional dual programming model in the central planning for regional development. First, a direct two-period interregional model has been presented and then that model has been used for constructing its dual. As a result of solving the dual of an interregional programming model one obtained the following dual variables (<b>accounting</b> <b>prices)</b> : regional prices for commodities, transportation services, manpower, valuations on restrictions concerning production increases, old production facilities, national investment quotas, export to and import from particular foreign markets. These <b>accounting</b> <b>prices</b> point to the directions of changes in the free terms of constraints where one could find an improvement to the objective function. Therefore they are of paramount importance to the planner. The article contains a detailed review of factors which determine the regional differentiation of <b>accounting</b> <b>prices</b> and a survey of possibilities how to equalize them in space. In the author's view the only possibility to eliminate regional differences in <b>accounting</b> <b>prices</b> exists with respect to mobile resources, particularly to the labour force.

Further analysis shows that if there is declining marginal product of factors, a ‘Hartwick investment rule’ for the model economy (set investment just equal to depletion, valued at the accounting price) will lead to declining consumption for the Wei (2015) accounting price, and increasing consumption for the Hamilton and Ruta (2009) accounting price.
