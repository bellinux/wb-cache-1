Admissibility is an interesting problem in statistical theory and received much attention. [18, 19] and [20] discussed the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> predictions of y_T. [21, 22] and [23] studied the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> estimations of β. We discuss the admissible predictors of δ in classes of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous linear predictors, respectively. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the simultaneous prediction to be admissible are provided.|$|R

Conversely, with the help of exponential dichotomy on time scales, we give the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> the pair (C_rd^b(T^+, X),L^p(T^+,X)) for an input-output equation on time scales.|$|R

From the national perspective, the issue <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> evidence is still subject to divergent solutions in the Member States, concerning the common law and continental law systems, i. e. the right of access to a lawyer.

40|$|Several {{methods for}} {{checking}} <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> {{rules in the}} modal logic $S 4 $ are presented in [1], [15]. These methods determine <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> rules in $S 4 $, but they don't determine or give substitutions rejecting inadmissible rules. In this paper, we investigate some relations between one of the above methods, based on the reduced normal form rules, and sets of substitutions which reject them.

40|$|In its {{meeting on}} 6 September 2012, the Governing Council of the ECB took {{decisions}} {{on a number}} of technical features regarding the Eurosystem’s outright transactions in secondary sovereign bond markets (OMT). This decision was challenged in the German Federal Constitutional Court (GFCC) by a number <b>of</b> constitutional <b>complaints</b> and other petitions. In its seminal judgment of 14 January 2014, the German court expressed serious doubts on the compatibility of the ECB’s decision with the European Union law. It admitted the complaints and petitions even though actual purchases had not been executed and the control of acts of an organ of the EU in principle is not the task of the GFCC. As justification for this procedure the court resorted to its judicature on a reserved “ultra vires” control and the defense of the “constitutional identiy” of Germany. In the end, however, the court referred the case pursuant to Article 267 TFEU to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for preliminary rulings on several questions of EU law. In substance, the German court assessed OMT as an act of economic policy which is not covered by the competences of the ECB. Furthermore, it judged OMT as a – by EU primary law – prohibited monetary financing of sovereign debt. The defense of the ECB (disruption of monetary policy transmission mechanism) was dismissed without closer scrutiny as being “irrelevant”. Finally the court opened, however, a way for a compromise by an interpretation of OMT in conformity with EU law under preconditions, specified in detail. Procedure and findings of this judgment were harshly criticized by many economists but also by the majority of legal scholars. This criticism is largely convincing in view <b>of</b> the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>complaints.</b> Even if the “ultra vires” control is in conformity with prior decisions of court it is in this judgment expanded further without compelling reasons. It is also questionable whether the standing of the complaining parties had to be accepted and whether the referral to the ECJ was indicated. The arguments of the court are, however, conclusive in respect of the transgression of competences by the ECB and – to somewhat lesser extent – in respect of the monetary debt financing. The dismissal of the defense as “irrelevant” is absolutey persuasive...|$|R
