He booked it for 10 days for , and requested the guest-house employees to keep the shooting schedule a secret. Choosing a room with windows overlooking a busy road, he proceeded to give it <b>an</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> look by replacing the windows' designer grilles with old-fashioned wooden ones, and by painting the room with some rough patches.|$|E
5|$|Mavis {{was portrayed}} as moralising, repressed, and dithering, and often {{appeared}} in comic scenes with her boss Rita Sullivan or her husband Derek Wilton. She was generally well received by critics, {{described as a}} national institution and one of Coronation Street's best loved characters, <b>an</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> spinster. Barlow has been praised for her portrayal of Mavis, a character notably spoofed by impressionist Les Dennis during the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Paths, arbors, and fences use {{traditional}} or antique looking materials. Wooden {{fences and}} gates, paths covered with locally made bricks or stone, and arbors using natural materials all give a more casual—and less formal—look and feel to a cottage garden. Pots, ornaments, and furniture also use natural looking materials with traditional finishes—everything is chosen {{to give the}} impression of <b>an</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> country garden.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} Moore's {{personal}} preferences were transferred into his characterisation of Bond: his taste for Cuban cigars and his wearing of safari suits {{were assigned to}} the character. Moore's use for cigars in his early films put him in contrast to the cigarette-smoking Connery, Lazenby and Dalton. By the time of Moore's fifth film, For Your Eyes Only, released in 1981, his characterisation had come to represent <b>an</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> character, in contrast to the fashionability Connery had brought to the role in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Primary {{ingredients}} in <b>an</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> doughnut include flour, sugar, eggs, sour cream or buttermilk, and leavening agents such as baking powder or baking soda. Additional ingredients may include milk, butter, vanilla extract and salt. The use of buttermilk or sour cream may impart a rich flavor to the doughnut. It is typically deep-fried, {{and may be}} deep fried at a lower temperature compared to other doughnut styles, having a crunchier texture compared to other cake doughnut styles. Frying at a lower temperature contributes to its rough, cracked texture. Being turned several times while cooking in the oil also contributes to its texture.|$|E
5|$|Springfield is in {{the midst}} of a massive heat wave. Every {{building}} in the town has installed a large air conditioning device. However, this draws a lot of power from the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Despite the safety measures Mr. Burns has taken (cutting power to the orphanage), the plant is at full power. At home, without an air conditioning device, the Simpsons have to follow <b>an</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> fan. Homer decides to give them a taste of winter by plugging in his dancing Santa Claus. This overloads the plant and causes a town-wide blackout. Eventually, widespread rioting and looting occur. The police try to intervene, but are powerless to stop the massive crime wave.|$|E

The fifth painting of the scroll corresponds to a scene described in the second text section of the Hinohara scroll, where Murasaki Shikibu is looking back to her first time at court. The painting shows Murasaki Shikibu inside a room with closed tsumado (hinged plank door) and shitomido (latticed shutters). Next to her is <b>an</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> interior light-fixture consisting of a wooden pole with an oil-filled dish and wick {{on top of it}} (tōdai).|$|E
5|$|Toy Story is a 1995 American computer-animated buddy comedy {{adventure}} film {{produced by}} Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. The directorial debut of John Lasseter, Toy Story {{was the first}} feature-length computer-animated film and the first feature film produced by Pixar. Taking place {{in a world where}} anthropomorphic toys pretend to be lifeless whenever humans are present, the film's plot focuses on the relationship between Woody, <b>an</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> pullstring cowboy doll (voiced by Tom Hanks), and Buzz Lightyear, an astronaut action figure (voiced by Tim Allen), as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of Andy, their owner, to friends who work together to be reunited with Andy as his family prepares to move to a new home. The screenplay was written by Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow, based on a story by Lasseter, Pete Docter, Stanton and Joe Ranft. The film features music by Randy Newman, and was executive-produced by Steve Jobs and Edwin Catmull.|$|E
5|$|In October 2008, Marvel Studios {{signed a}} {{long-term}} lease agreement with Raleigh Studios to photograph their next four films—Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers—at Raleigh's Manhattan Beach, California facility. Production Weekly reported that filming on Marvel's Thor {{was scheduled to}} begin in Los Angeles mid-January, then move to Santa Fe, New Mexico from March until late-April. Principal photography began on January 11, 2010. A few days after filming began, Clark Gregg signed on to reprise his role from Iron Man and Iron Man 2 as Agent Coulson. In February, Paramount Pictures entered negotiations with Del Mar, California to use a 300-yard stretch of beach to film a scene for Thor involving six horses running down the terrain. Paramount said this coastline was ideal because its gradual slope of sand down to the waterline creates excellent reflective opportunities on film. On March 15, 2010, production of Thor moved to Galisteo, New Mexico where Cerro Pelon Ranch, <b>an</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> Western film town, was extensively modified for the shoot.|$|E

5|$|The pilot {{episode was}} heavily {{promoted}} {{in the weeks}} leading up to its airing. Laura Benanti appeared on a retro style cover of Playboy magazine released on September 16, 2011. The magazine had a 1961 theme, which included <b>an</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> visual style, photos of 1960s Playboy bunnies and clubs, and the same sixty cent price as that time period. Benanti wore a black bunny costume and held a tray with drinks on the cover photo. NBC also entered into a cross-promotional deal with the Bloomingdale's department store. The Walton Street store in Chicago included display windows inspired by the series, which were unveiled in September 2011 by Benanti, as well as Naturi Naughton and Wes Ramsey. Chosen for the storefronts due to its close proximity to the original Playboy Club, the Walton Street store allowed visitors to take virtual photos with the show's stars, view photos of the real-life clubs and the show's set, and enter into a contest to win such prizes as a walk-on role on the show and a $5,000 Bloomingdale's shopping spree.|$|E
5|$|Selworthy is a {{small village}} and civil parish which {{includes}} the hamlets of Bossington, Tivington, Lynch, Brandish Street and Allerford. Bossington is separated from Porlock Bay by a shingle beach, through which flows the River Horner, forming part of the Porlock Ridge and Saltmarsh Site of Special Scientific Interest. In the 1990s rising sea levels created salt marshes, and lagoons developed in the area behind the boulder bank. The village is on the South West Coast Path. Selworthy was rebuilt as a model village, to provide housing for the aged and infirm of the Holnicote estate, in 1828 by Sir Thomas Acland. Many of the other cottages, {{some of which are}} now rented out, are still thatched and are listed buildings, whose walls are painted with limewash that has been tinted creamy yellow with ochre. On the hill above the village is the whitewashed 15th-century Church of All Saints, with a 14th-century tower. One of Allerford's main attractions is the much-photographed packhorse bridge. Built as a crossing over the River Aller (from which the village gets its name), it is thought to be medieval in origin. The village is also home to Allerford House, childhood home of Admiral John Moresby, who explored the coastline of New Guinea and for whom Port Moresby, the capital city of Papua New Guinea, was named. Other features of the village include thatched cottages, a forge and <b>an</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> red telephone box. There is also a Reading Room, built by the Acland family to foster adult education. One of the thatched cottages operated as the local Primary School between 1821 and 1981 and is now a museum containing the West Somerset Rural Life Museum and Victorian School. The museum houses the West Somerset Photographic Archive.|$|E

25|$|Today, modern font {{programming}} divides ligatures {{into three}} groups, {{which can be}} activated separately: standard, contextual and historical.
