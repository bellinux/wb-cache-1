5|$|Matt Bissonnette, a SEAL {{who participated}} in the raid, wrote an account of the mission in the book No Easy Day (2012), which {{significantly}} contradicts Pfarrer's account. Bissonnette wrote that the helicopter <b>approach</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> matched the official version. According to Bissonnette, when bin Laden peered out at the Americans advancing on his third-floor room, the SEAL who fired upon him hit him {{on the right side of}} the head. Bin Laden stumbled into his bedroom, where the SEALs found him crumpled and twitching on the floor in a pool of body matter, with two women crying over his body. The other SEALs allegedly grabbed the women, moved them away, and shot bin Laden repeatedly in the chest until he was dead. According to Bissonnette, the weapons in the room—an AK-47 rifle and a Makarov pistol—were unloaded.|$|E

25|$|Tivat Airport is {{assigned}} 4D classification by ICAO, airspace class D, and is {{noted for its}} challenging <b>approach</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> procedures. Landing at Tivat is considered demanding due to hilly terrain surrounding the valley in which the airport is situated, and strong prevailing crosswinds. Runway 32 approach requires a descent into the valley of Tivatsko polje, and a 20° turn for runway alignment just before landing. Runway 14 approach is even more challenging, because of the circle to land maneuver executed in the dramatic scenery surrounding the Bay of Kotor. It is known among pilots as the European Kai Tak because of its tricky <b>approach</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> procedures. Passengers are awarded spectacular views of the bay, the surrounding mountains and a low flyby over Porto Montenegro luxury yacht marina. The airport is also popular among plane spotters, as end of the runway is easily accessible and offers unobstructed views of takeoffs and landings, with a scenic mountain backdrop.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{basic information}} about an {{instrument landing system}} (ILS). An ILS operates as a ground-based instrument approach system, which provides precision lateral and vertical guidance to an aircraft <b>approaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> on a runway, {{using a combination of}} radio signals.

25|$|The {{crash site}} was within {{international}} waters, but the National Transportation Safety Board carried out an investigation, {{which was published}} on July 1, 1970. The report stated the probable cause as improper crew resource management and stated that the aircraft was fully capable of carrying out the <b>approach</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing.</b> The aircraft was conducting an instrument approach, but was following an unauthorized back course approach.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} his backup assignment on Apollo 16, Haise {{moved over to}} the Space Shuttle program. In 1977, he participated in the program's <b>Approach</b> <b>and</b> <b>Landing</b> Tests at Edwards Air Force Base. Along with C. Gordon Fullerton as Pilot, Haise as Commander piloted the Space Shuttle Enterprise in free flight to three successful landings after being released from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft. These tests successfully verified the shuttle's flight characteristics, an important step toward the overall success of the program.|$|E
25|$|Because of the above, St Helena Airport was {{equipped}} with an instrument landing system (ILS) and a Doppler VHF Omni-directional Radio Range system (DVOR) supplied by Thales Group. Further to that Honeywell Aerospace supplied a SmartPath ground-based augmentation system (GBAS), a technology that augments global positioning system (GPS) signals to make them suitable for precision <b>approach</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing.</b> It overcomes many {{of the limitations of}} instrument landing systems (ILS) traditionally used by airports to guide aircraft as they approach the runway.|$|E

50|$|An {{instrument}} landing system operates as a ground-based instrument approach system that provides precision lateral and vertical guidance to an aircraft <b>approaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> on a runway, {{using a combination of}} radio signals and, in many cases, high-intensity lighting arrays to enable a safe landing during instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), such as low ceilings or reduced visibility due to fog, rain, or blowing snow.|$|R
25|$|Most {{test pilot}} schools use multiple, more {{specific}} minimum control speeds, as VMC will change {{depending on the}} stage of flight. Other defined VMCs include minimum control speed on the ground (VMCG) and minimum control speed during <b>approach</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> (VMCL). In addition, with aircraft with four or more engines, VMCs exist for cases with either one or two engines inoperative on the same wing. Figure 1 illustrates the VMCs that are defined in the relevant civil aviation regulations and in military specifications.|$|E
25|$|The time of {{departure}} for the accident flight was from Sorong to Kaimana at 12:45 P.M and estimated arrival at 13:54 P.M with the Second in Command (SIC) as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Pilot in Command (PIC) as Pilot Monitoring (PM). The aircraft dispatch release from Sorong indicated that the flight was planned under the Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). The destination, Kaimana, had no published instrument approach procedure. Terminal area operations, including <b>approach</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing,</b> were required to be conducted under the Visual Flight Rules (VFR).|$|E
25|$|On 23 August 2008, AIRES Flight 051 {{sustained}} substantial damage {{following the}} collapse of the right hand main landing gear on landing at Barranquilla-Ernesto Cortissoz Airport (BAQ), Colombia. None of the 31 occupants were injured. The Bombardier Dash 8-301, registered HK-3952, operated on an international flight from Curaçao-Hato International Airport (CUR). The <b>approach</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> were normal, touching down about 770 metres past the threshold of runway 23. The crew noticed a vibration of the right hand main gear. The undercarriage leg collapsed. There was no fire.|$|E
50|$|An {{overhead}} join is {{a conventional}} method for an aircraft to <b>approach</b> <b>and</b> safely <b>land</b> at an airfield. It helps a pilot to integrate with any air traffic pattern near an airfield, join any circuit, <b>and</b> <b>land.</b>|$|R
40|$|Radar {{echoes of}} a storm at John F. Kennedy International Airport are examined. Results {{regarding}} the phenomena presented suggest the existence of downburst cells.

25|$|Upon {{receiving}} clearance, a non-standard terminology {{was used}} by air-traffic control. As {{he did not have}} authorization to use a localizer back-course approach, the captain should have requested a different approach. Instead, the crew opted to conduct a VOR approach without informing air-traffic control. Neither pilot had carried out instrument <b>approach</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> at runway 07R, making them less familiar with this than their commonly used Runway 25. Another factor was that the SAS aircraft was forced to operate at the lowest-permissible safe speeds while closing in on the Cessna.|$|E
25|$|The Ioannis Kapodistrias International Airport, {{named after}} Ioannis Kapodistrias, a {{distinguished}} Corfiot and European diplomat, {{and the first}} governor of the independent Greek state, is located around three kilometres south of Kerkyra, just half a kilometre north of Pontikonisi. The <b>approach</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing,</b> in a northeasterly direction, afford passengers spectacular aerial views of Pontikonisi and Vlaheraina Monastery, also taking {{in the hills of}} Kanoni, as the runway employed for landing lies a few hundred metres from these spectacular local landmarks. The airport offers domestic flights from Olympic Airlines (OA 600, 602 and 606), and Aegean Airlines (A3 402, 404 and 406).

25|$|The first {{reusable}} spacecraft, the X-15, was air-launched on a suborbital trajectory on July 19, 1963. The first partially reusable orbital spacecraft, the Space Shuttle, {{was launched}} by the USA on the 20th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's flight, on April 12, 1981. During the Shuttle era, six orbiters were built, {{all of which have}} flown in the atmosphere and five of which have flown in space. The Enterprise was used only for <b>approach</b> <b>and</b> <b>landing</b> tests, launching from the back of a Boeing 747 and gliding to deadstick landings at Edwards AFB, California. The first Space Shuttle to fly into space was the Columbia, followed by the Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour. The Endeavour was built to replace the Challenger, which was lost in January 1986. The Columbia broke up during reentry in February 2003.|$|E
