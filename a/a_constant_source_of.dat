5|$|Bardanes's revolt {{temporarily}} weakened Byzantium, {{especially in}} its capability {{to deal with}} the Arab threat to the East, but Qasim's invasion was of limited scope, and his father's far larger intervention shortly after also resulted in no major military confrontations: Harun withdrew after a truce was concluded in exchange for a modest sum. Thus the revolt did not seriously affect the army or most of Anatolia. Nevertheless, it is indicative of the soldiers' dissatisfaction with Nikephoros, which would surface again in subsequent years and prove <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> trouble throughout his reign.|$|E

They said their farewells in Castlebay but it did not work out for the latter and he returned from the United States three months later. To his great surprise he met his friend in Castlebay again, who explained that he had been unable to return to Mingulay since they had last met because of adverse sea conditions.

The English Parliament did not want the throne to revert to a Catholic, and so passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which settled the throne of England on Electress Sophia of Hanover, a cousin of King James II, and her Protestant heirs.|$|E

Conversely, the emancipation by ransom of a city that had been entirely reduced to slavery carried great prestige: Cassander, in 316 BC, restored Thebes.

5|$|In Britain the {{campaign}} emphasised the important lesson previously {{demonstrated in the}} Trafalgar campaign of the year before, that it was immensely difficult in {{the vastness of the}} Atlantic Ocean to detect and intercept French squadrons at sea: only off their own harbours and in the confined waters of the Caribbean were they vulnerable to detection and attack by British squadrons. The inadequate size and power of convoy escorts and the expense in resources employed in chasing French squadrons at sea meant that British trade was placed at risk by the depredations of independent French squadrons, and the maintenance of a tight blockade was essential. The British grip on French maritime travel was <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> irritation to Napoleon, who instigated a massive shipbuilding program with the intention of breaking the blockade: by 1808 he was able to muster over 80 ships of the line against the British blockade squadrons.|$|E

40|$|When Minnesota {{engaged in}} the great reform and recodification effort {{that led to the}} Criminal Code of 1963, {{it was part of a}} {{nationwide}} reform movement. That movement was spurred in large part by the American Law Institute and its Model Penal Code. The Minnesota drafters were influenced by the MPC, and at least in some areas, adopted MPC recommendations. The MPC’s most significant innovation was in the law of mens rea—the body of law concerning the mental state or “guilty mind” necessary for criminal liability. The MPC drafters recognized that the common law of mens rea was fundamentally incoherent and had been <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> confusion for courts. The MPC drafters therefore created a bold new mens rea framework. Minnesota, however, did not adopt that framework. Instead, the drafters of the 1963 Code attempted smaller changes, and since then, Minnesota courts have continued to rely heavily on the common law of mens rea. As a result, the same mens rea problems that befuddled old common law courts linger in Minnesota today. These problems cause needless confusion and unpredictability in the criminal law. It is time for Minnesota to enact further reforms to move the Code closer to the MPC mens rea framework...|$|R

25|$|Riparian {{zones are}} {{characterized}} by a distinct community of plant species that are physiologically adapted to a greater amount of freshwater than upland species.

50|$|There is {{evidence}} that supports both of the claims that the extinction of P. goliah {{may have been due}} to climate shifts during the Pleistocene or to human hunting.

P. goliah's need for <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> free-standing <b>source</b> <b>of</b> water, plus its height and its common habitat in open shrub lands, made the P. goliah more noticeable to the human hunters, thus making it vulnerable to humans who were also water-bound like the Procoptodon.|$|R
