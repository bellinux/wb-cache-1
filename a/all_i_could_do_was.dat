2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{departure}} from NASCAR Ambrose stated: [...] "I think I've accomplished all I can accomplish in NASCAR. When I came it was clear <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> win races and not have any chance at a championship. I've enjoyed my time here and I will miss my friends and the other drivers very much but this move is done mostly to help my children get raised in our native country and I feel like I {{want to start a}} new chapter in my life. I'm glad to leave with multiple wins in NASCAR and having raced for the King." ...|$|E
2500|$|May {{spoke about}} this {{incident}} years later, saying, [...] "the first thing I knew I was being fired {{on from the}} rear ... <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> try to dodge my attacker. I noticed it was a red tri-plane, but if I realized it was Richthofen, I would have probably {{passed out on the}} spot. I kept on dodging and spinning, I imagine from about 12,000 feet until I ran out of sky and had to hedge hop over the ground. Richthofen was firing at me continually, [...] the only thing that saved me was my poor flying. I didn't know what I was doing myself and I do not suppose that Richthofen could figure out what I was going to do".|$|E
6000|$|... "So <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> {{to go back}} to {{the other}} room, and tell him that I wanted her to go to sleep, and that he must not call out to her until I told him.|$|E
60|$|I {{stopped the}} night-work, {{but this was}} <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> for these neighbors.|$|R
6000|$|... "Looks {{as if we}} were snowed in {{good and}} proper," [...] {{returned}} another man. [...] "I wanted to get to one of those stores across the way, and <b>I</b> had about <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to make it. In one place I got into snow up to my waist, and it was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to get out of it." ...|$|R
60|$|Tho. Nay, I don't know, {{but in a}} fright it was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Resigned! What of that? I held my tongue! It was all I could do! I {{never knew}} {{things could be}} worse till I saw it was killing him, and then <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> still to keep silence.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She pursues {{me about}} the place. This morning she {{appeared}} in the smoking-room. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to seize my hat and fly. I didn't want to come, but I couldn't stay and face another meal with her." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had read}} of the fiendish vengeance which awaited a spy. I knew that men {{with their lives}} in their hands would stick at nothing. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to cower {{at the bottom of}} the boat and listen silently to their whispered talk below.|$|E
60|$|I nodded my head again. It was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to {{keep myself}} {{standing}} upright.|$|R
60|$|I rode {{back with}} a heavy heart. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> now was to send {{the letter to the}} post-office, Stockholm.|$|R
6000|$|Plac. I {{must not}} farther by your prayers be won: [...] <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> <b>I</b> have already done. [...] [To her.|$|R
60|$|Of course I was puzzled; {{it was not}} in {{that fashion}} that I had {{expected}} Madame Blumenthal to make use of my information. But the matter now was quite out of my hands, and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to bid my companion not work himself into a fever over either fortune.|$|E
6000|$|Colohan strode close, big and formidable. [...] "If {{you mean}} me, you're a liar," [...] he declared. [...] "An' don't say it!" [...] Coffee was plainly intimidated, and Colohan turned to Neale. [...] "Boss, I swear I wasn't {{in on this}} deal. Lately I guessed it was all wrong. But <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> obey orders." ...|$|E
60|$|If I {{had known}} {{there was any}} {{probability}} of rain I should have put on my coat before I started out on this somewhat unusual method of travelling, {{but there was no}} help for it now, and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to hurry on. From walking fast I began to trot. The drops were coming down quite frequently.|$|E
60|$|So I wilted {{right down}} {{on to the}} planks then, and give up; and it was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep from crying.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{to keep a}} {{straight}} face. I'd {{a pretty good idea}} where she 'ad gorn; and it wasn't Dalston.|$|R
60|$|But now {{my voice}} was fainter. It was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to get my breath. The room swam round and round before my eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, shut {{up in your}} room. I {{never thought}} of {{speaking}} to you. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to be as restive as possible, {{and when she did}} not care for that, there was nothing for it but playing on her German superstition. So Arthur told her some awful stones about whipping blacks to death, and declared West Indian families were very apt to be haunted; but that it was a subject never to be mentioned to mamma nor my aunt.' ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was easy}} {{for me and for}} others to prove that the first {{statement}} was not only, to use the Duke of Argyll's favourite expression, [...] "contrary to fact," [...] but that it was without any foundation whatever. The second statement rested on the Duke of Argyll's personal authority. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to demand the production of the evidence for it. Up to the present time, so far as I know, that evidence has not made its appearance; nor has there been any withdrawal of, or apology for, the erroneous charge.|$|E
60|$|Oh! {{that last}} five minutes! It seemed as many centuries. Like stone statues we sat, {{each of us}} lost in his own thoughts, though for my part the power of clear {{thinking}} appeared to have left me. Visions of a sort flowed over my mind without sinking into it, as water flows over marble. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> fix {{my eyes on the}} face of that watch, of which in the flickering lamp-light the second-hand seemed to my excited fancy to grow enormous and jump {{from one side of the}} room to the other.|$|E
6000|$|Then, {{in spite}} of <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep him, he went, muttering: [...] "Strange! Exceeding strange!" [...] and leaving me quite unfit for prayer.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Every day I gazed on {{the lovely}} fruit, which became {{gradually}} {{more and more}} tempting-looking, and it was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> not to break the magician's commands.|$|R
6000|$|... "After {{that last}} {{manoeuvre}} of yours," [...] he said, [...] "it was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{to prevent him}} from rushing over to Jerry Shorter's--and signing the lease." ...|$|R
6000|$|MR. RICHARDS: [...] "Upon my soul, I don't {{know what}} you mean! I DON'T know what I've done. When you came at me, last night, with my ring and {{presents}} and other little traps, you might have knocked me down with the lightest of the lot. I was perfectly dazed; I couldn't say anything before you were off, and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to hope that you'd be more like yourself in the morning. And in the morning, when I came round to Mrs. Philips's, I found you were gone, and I came after you by the next train." ...|$|E
60|$|Yes! {{not even}} Lucilla's {{interests}}--dearly as I loved her; alarmed as I felt about her--were as sacred as the interests which {{called me to}} my father's bedside. I had some hours to spare before {{it would be necessary}} for me to leave her. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to employ those hours in taking the strictest precautions I could think of to protect her in my absence. I could not be long parted from her. One way or the other, the miserable doubt whether my father would live or die, would, at his age, soon be over.|$|E
6000|$|... "A week later. I am already losing {{count of}} days, but days matter nothing. I have been busy, so busy that I {{have not even}} had time to write. After I had {{finished}} my story so far, Saleh's slave woman took me to Abdullah's house. I {{found that he was}} in a state of high fever, but <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to recommend that a wet rag should be applied, and freshly wetted every quarter of an hour; that his head should be kept similarly enveloped, in wet bandages; and that his hands should be dipped in water very frequently.|$|E
60|$|It was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep awake, but I {{managed to}} do so {{with the aid of}} an early morning paper I bought on the train.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{poor girl}} was dreadfully shook up," [...] put in Mrs. Akerson. [...] "She {{just went on}} somethin' terrible. <b>I</b> had <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to quiet her at first." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please don't say I pushed you over. It was Toglet, and {{directly}} after you disappeared {{he turned on}} me and <b>I</b> had <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep him at bay." ...|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} the sun set, the wind had so far abated, and the sea had gone down so much, as to remove all further apprehensions from the gale. The ship lay-to easily, and I had no {{occasion}} to give myself any trouble on her account. Had there been light, I should now have put the helm up, and run to leeward, {{in the hope of}} finding the spars, and at least of keeping near Marble; but, fearful of passing him in the darkness, I deferred that duty until the morning. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to watch the weather, in order to make this effort, before the wind should shift.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was vain {{to ask him}} {{to leave}} it, and to let me read it again (as I wished) when I was left by myself. He is {{determined}} to keep it side by side with that other paper which I had seen him take out of his pocket-book, and which contains the written narrative of Armadale's Dream. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to ask his leave to copy it; and this he granted readily. I wrote the copy in his presence; and I now place it here in my diary, to mark a day {{which is one of the}} memorable days in my life.|$|E
60|$|How I {{wished that}} we could carry off the huge {{skeleton}} to add to my collection of trophies, but this was impossible. As Brother John said, any museum would have been glad to purchase it for hundreds of pounds, for I do not suppose that its like exists in the world. But it was too heavy; <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to impress its peculiarities upon my mind by a close study of the mighty bones. Also I picked out of the upper right arm, and kept the bullet I had fired when it carried off the Kalubi. This I found had sunk into and shattered the bone, but without absolutely breaking it.|$|E
6000|$|Putney laughed. [...] "It was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep Ellen {{from getting}} up and going out of church too, when Brother Gerrish set the example. She's a Gerrishite at heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My sweetheart, when I saw {{you doing}} that Dream of What's-the-girl's-bally-name dance just now, it was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep from rushing out on {{to the floor and}} hugging you.' ...|$|R
25|$|From my {{earliest}} childhood I have been toiling & wearing my heart out for other people, who took <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> & suffer {{for them as}} no more than their just dues.|$|R
