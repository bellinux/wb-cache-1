5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century, the {{mechanics}} of how dew condenses were much better understood. The key insight was that low-mass collectors which rapidly lose heat by radiation perform best. <b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>researchers</b> worked on this method. In the early 1960s, dew condensers made from sheets of polyethylene supported on a simple frame resembling a ridge tent were used in Israel to irrigate plants. Saplings supplied with dew and very slight rainfall from these collectors survived much better than the control group planted without such aids– they all dried up over the summer. In 1986 in New Mexico condensers made of a special foil produced sufficient water to supply young saplings.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} impact {{cratering}} remained {{more or less}} speculative until the 1960s. At that time <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>researchers,</b> most notably Eugene Shoemaker, (co-discoverer of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9), conducted detailed studies {{of a number of}} craters and recognized clear evidence that they had been created by impacts, specifically identifying the shock-metamorphic effects uniquely associated with impact events, of which the most familiar is shocked quartz.|$|E

25|$|During the Industrial Revolution the {{electrical}} industry exploited direct current (DC) and low frequency alternating current (AC), {{but not much}} was known about frequencies above 20kHz, what are now called radio frequencies. In 1887, four years previously, Heinrich Hertz had discovered Hertzian waves (radio waves), electromagnetic waves which oscillated at very high frequencies. This attracted much attention, and <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>researchers</b> began experimenting with high frequency currents.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s and 1950s, <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>researchers</b> {{explored}} {{the connection between}} neurology, information theory, and cybernetics. Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as W. Grey Walter's turtles and the Johns Hopkins Beast. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at Princeton University and the Ratio Club in England. By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Oviraptorosaurs, like deinonychosaurs, are so bird-like {{that several}} {{scientists}} consider {{them to be}} true birds, more advanced than Archaeopteryx. Gregory S. Paul {{has written extensively on}} this possibility, and Teresa Maryańska and colleagues published a technical paper detailing this idea in 2002. Michael Benton, in his widely respected text Vertebrate Paleontology, also included oviraptorosaurs as an order within the class Aves. However, <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>researchers</b> have disagreed with this classification, retaining oviraptorosaurs as non-avialan maniraptorans slightly more primitive than the deinonychosaurs.|$|E

25|$|Dialogue {{journals}} {{have been}} studied by <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>researchers</b> for their value in developing students' critical thinking by providing {{opportunities for students to}} practice self-reflective awareness and to critique classroom practices, teaching assignments, and social contexts, in both first and second language acquisition settings. Practice with critical thinking in exploring their own worlds and the worlds of others, with the words that they have at their disposal, results in students experiencing personal empowerment and expressing a personal voice—the unique expression of the self that seems like hearing that particular person speak in their writing.|$|E
25|$|Konarski {{undertook}} to compile {{all of the}} sejm legislative records in his Volumina legum. Andrzej Stanisław Załuski extended his patronage to the most outstanding historian in the Commonwealth, Gottfried Lengnich of Danzig, future teacher of Stanisław Antoni Poniatowski. Lengnich wrote in 1742 Ius publicum Regni Poloniae, an outstanding description of the Polish political system, {{and a history of}} Royal Prussia. Related work was done {{in the first half of}} the 18th century by <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>researchers</b> in Danzig, Thorn, Elbing and Königsberg. Scientists of German origin were responsible for and catalyzed much of the early scientific revival in the Commonwealth.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s, James S. McDonnell, board {{chairman}} of McDonnell Douglas and {{believer in the}} paranormal, began to give grants to <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>researchers</b> who were working in the PSI field. Looking for a more substantial effort, he approached his home town's Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri with plans {{to set up a}} permanent PSI research facility. At first his overtures were rebuffed, but eventually physicist Peter Phillips, who was also interested in the field, agreed to lead up a parapsychology lab at the school. In 1979, McDonnell arranged a $500,000 USD grant for the establishment and five years operation of the McDonnell Laboratory for Psychical Research.|$|E

25|$|During the 19th century, <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>researchers</b> {{questioned}} Winckelmann's dating of the bronze. August Emil Braun, {{the secretary}} of the Archaeological Institute of Rome, proposed in 1854 that the damage to the wolf's paw had been caused by an error during casting. Wilhelm Fröhner, the Conservator of the Louvre, stated in 1878 that style of the statue was attributable to the Carolingian period rather than the Etruscan, and in 1885 Wilhelm von Bode also stated that he was of the view that the statue was most likely a medieval work. However, these views were largely disregarded and had been forgotten by the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|During the 1910s {{and early}} 1920s <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>researchers</b> {{discovered}} that shorter wavelength signals were reflected off what {{would later be}} known as the ionosphere. This allowed the signal to hop over very long distances by reflecting multiple times off the ground and ionosphere. This greatly extended range, allowing lower power transmitters to be used for very long-range communications. By 1923 a number of amateur radio operators (hams) demonstrated excellent performance at 100m and started routine trans-Atlantic communications the next year. This led to a number of new frequency bands being defined in this shortwave region, as short as 10m (which is very long by today's standards). By 1930 these frequencies were in widespread use for many purposes.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>researchers</b> (David Rodda, Jacob Vigdor, and Janna Matlack), {{argue that}} a {{shortage}} of affordable housing – {{at least in the}} US – is caused in part by income inequality. David Rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991, the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased (Rhoda 1994:148). Through gentrification of older neighbourhoods, for example, in East New York, rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units. The ad valorem property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{providing}} help for complex application interfaces {{has been a}} source <b>of</b> interest for <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>researcher</b> efforts. <b>As</b> the computational power of computers increases, typical applications not only increase in functionality but also in the degree of interaction with the computational environment in which they reside. This paper describes an ongoing project to design an Intelligent Help System (IHS) that provides context-sensitivity not only through its modeling of application states but also its modeling of the interaction between applications and between an application and the environment in which it resides...|$|R
25|$|Lions {{also have}} a strong {{commitment}} to community hearing- and cancer-screening projects. In Perth, Western Australia, they have conducted hearing screening for over 30 years and provided seed funding for the Lions Ear and Hearing Institute established September 9, 2001, a center of excellence in the diagnosis, management, and research of ear and hearing disorders. In Perth, Lions have also been instrumental in the establishment of the Lions Eye Institute. In Brisbane, Queensland, the Lions Medical Research Foundation provides funding to <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>researchers.</b> Ian Frazer's initial work, leading {{to the development of a}} HPV vaccine for the human papillomavirus which could lead to cervical cancer, was funded by the Lions Medical Research Foundation.|$|E
25|$|In February 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{provided}} a statistic showing that nearly a billion monarchs have {{vanished from the}} overwintering sites since 1990. At that time, {{one of the main}} reasons cited was the herbicides used by farmers and homeowners on milkweed, a plant used as a food source, a home and a nursery by the monarchs. A 2016 study also attributed the last decade's ten-fold decline in overwintering numbers of the eastern monarch population to the loss of breeding habitat, namely the many species of milkweed (Asclepias species) that developing larvae require for food, however scientists believe there are other factors as well. <b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>researchers</b> believe milkweed loss during the breeding season is the cause because declines in milkweed abundance are highly correlated with the adoption of herbicide-tolerant genetically modified corn and soybeans, which now constitute 89% and 94% of these crops, respectively, in the U.S. However, correlative evidence does not prove causation, and other possible causes of the overwintering declines have been proposed.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} this {{approach}} {{was that it was}} very difficult to focus the electron guns on the ridges without the signal bleeding over to the ridges on either side. This problem was compounded by the changing angle between the gun and the ridges as the signal progressed down the screen. Similar designs were attempted by <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>researchers,</b> the best known being the Geer tube that used pyramid-shaped patterns with three guns arranged around the back. None of these systems could ever be made to work reliably, with focussing and alignment being continual problems. There is no documentary evidence that a successful version of the three-gun Telechrome tube was ever built, although images of Baird holding a prototype are widely duplicated. The prototype that usually appears is the two-gun tube. The two-gun tube actually had three necks. For this reason, people often mistake this tube for a three-gun prototype. In fact, the third neck is the original neck from the Hewittic envelope. This third neck holds not a gun, but instead, supports for the two-sided target. Burns published a typical photo of the two-gun, three-neck tube.|$|E
