40|$|The {{therapeutic}} alliance {{has been}} established as a consistent predictor of outcome in individual therapy with adults. In family therapy, research on the alliance {{is a relatively new}} field. The purpose of this literature review was to examine the association between the therapeutic alliance and outcome in family therapy. The study examines both the alliance between children/adolescents <b>and</b> <b>therapist</b> <b>and</b> the alliance between parents <b>and</b> <b>therapist,</b> <b>and</b> these alliances’ relations with outcome. 26 articles were included, and a large number of these have found associations between both types of alliances and outcomes. There is a tendency for the alliance between parent <b>and</b> <b>therapist</b> to be more related with drop-out or retention than the alliance between youth <b>and</b> <b>therapist.</b> There is also a tendency for the alliance between youth <b>and</b> <b>therapist</b> to be more related with youths’ psychological improvement. Split alliances seem to be related with drop-out. The studies are varied, and they have some methodological limitations. For these reasons, more studies on the associations between the alliance and outcome in family therapy are needed...|$|R

40|$|Given the {{importance}} of client characteristics <b>and</b> preferences, <b>and</b> <b>therapist</b> expertise to evidence-based practice in psychology, the current study sought {{to contribute to the}} literature concerning the role of values in psychotherapy. Personal values of clients <b>and</b> trainee <b>therapists</b> in 29 dyads were examined for relationships between client <b>and</b> <b>therapist</b> values <b>and</b> associations with working alliance and outcomes. Although previous literature in this area has suggested that successful therapy is characterized by an increase in similarity of client <b>and</b> <b>therapist</b> values, the current study did not replicate this finding. However, client perceptions of therapist values were found to be important to working alliance and outcome. Findings are discussed in terms of suggestions for future research as well as implications for clinical practice, including {{the importance}} of discussing expectations and preferences with clients...|$|R

25|$|Hermeneutic theorists <b>and</b> <b>therapists</b> {{write that}} ontological hermeneutics is ideally {{situated}} {{to address this}} limitation of individualism because it upholds from the outset {{that human beings are}} relational and it attempts to explain human suffering and healing in these relational contexts. What ontological hermeneutics theory is saying {{is that it is not}} through isolated reflection upon personal cognitive and affective processes that heals psychological suffering. Instead, it is being-in-the-world and relating authentically to others through dialogue that provides a nexus of healthy, meaningful relationships that alleviates human suffering and promotes a sense of the good life for Dasein.|$|E

25|$|While {{studies have}} {{reported}} inconsistent results with regards to music's effect on memory, it has been demonstrated that music is able to interfere with various memory tasks. It has been demonstrated that new situations require new combinations of cognitive processing. This subsequently results in conscious attention being drawn to novel aspects of situations. Therefore, the loudness of music presentation along with other musical elements can assist in distracting one from normal responses by encouraging attentiveness to the musical information. Attention and recall {{have been shown to}} be negatively affected by the presence of a distraction. Wolfe (1983) cautions that educators <b>and</b> <b>therapists</b> should be made aware of the potential for environments with sounds occurring simultaneously from many sources (musical and non-musical) to distract and interfere with student learning.|$|E
25|$|Vaginismus {{has been}} {{classified}} by Lamont {{according to the}} severity of the condition. Lamont describes four degrees of vaginismus: In first degree vaginismus, the patient has spasm of the pelvic floor that can be relieved with reassurance. In second degree, the spasm is present but maintained throughout the pelvis even with reassurance. In third degree, the patient elevates the buttocks to avoid being examined. In fourth degree vaginismus (also known as grade 4 vaginismus), the most severe form of vaginismus, the patient elevates the buttocks, retreats and tightly closes the thighs to avoid examination. Pacik expanded the Lamont classification to include a fifth degree in which the patient experiences a visceral reaction such as sweating, hyperventilation, palpitations, trembling, shaking, nausea, vomiting, losing consciousness, wanting to jump off the table, or attacking the doctor. The Lamont classification continues to be used to the present and allows for a common language among researchers <b>and</b> <b>therapists.</b>|$|E
