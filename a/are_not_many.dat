5|$|Settlements of the Gold Rush era, such as Portuguese Flat on the Sacramento River, sprang into {{existence}} and then faded. The Gold Rush town of Weaverville on the Trinity River today retains the oldest continuously used Taoist temple in California, {{a legacy of}} Chinese miners who came. While there <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>many</b> Gold Rush era ghost towns still in existence, {{the remains of the}} once-bustling town of Shasta have been preserved in a California State Historic Park in Northern California.|$|E
5|$|As {{time goes}} by, Rumpelstiltskin and Belle develop a strong bond with each other. After {{a few months}} of living with him, Belle asks the dark one why she found children's {{clothing}} upstairs. Rumpelstiltskin tells her it belonged to his son whom he unfortunately lost along with his wife. Gaston arrives to take Belle back but Rumpelstiltskin turns him into a rose and presents it to her as a gift. When asked about Gaston, Belle says that it was an arranged marriage, not one of love. She left him because she wanted to be heroic and there <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>many</b> chances for women to be heroic. Rumpelstiltskin asks Belle to go into town to buy more straw, and she cannot believe he trusts her to come back. Rumpelstiltskin says he does not expect to see her again.|$|E

5|$|The Lord of the Rings {{contains}} {{several more}} supporting scenes, {{and has a}} more sophisticated plot structure, following the paths of multiple characters. Tolkien wrote the later story in much less humorous tones and infused it with more complex moral and philosophical themes. The {{differences between the two}} stories can cause difficulties when readers, expecting them to be similar, find that they <b>are</b> <b>not.</b> <b>Many</b> of the thematic and stylistic differences arose because Tolkien wrote The Hobbit as a story for children, and The Lord of the Rings for the same audience, who had subsequently grown up since its publication. Further, Tolkien's concept of Middle-earth was to continually change and slowly evolve throughout his life and writings.|$|E

25|$|Science uses computing. Computing uses science. We {{have seen}} the {{development}} of Computer Science. There <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>many</b> who can bridge all three of these.

25|$|The body is {{the area}} between the orifice (opening) and base (bottom). The maximum {{diameter}} of a vessel is usually at {{the middle of the}} body or a bit higher.

25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>many</b> {{literary}} works {{that can be}} unambiguously identified as originally written in Great Moravia. One of them is Proglas, a cultivated poem in which Cyril defends the Slavic liturgy. Vita Cyrilli (attributed to Clement of Ohrid) and Vita Methodii (written probably by Methodius' successor Gorazd) are biographies with precious information about Great Moravia under Rastislav and Svatopluk I.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the effects}} of {{environment}} on language acquisition, it is important that all languages are valued and have support for proper bilingual growth. This includes having proper resources to encourage learning and use of multiple languages.

25|$|Apart {{from his}} correspondence, there <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>many</b> known details about Gauss' {{personal}} creed. Many biographers of Gauss disagree about his religious stance, with Bühler and others considering him a deist with very unorthodox views, while Dunnington (though admitting that Gauss {{did not believe}} literally in all Christian dogmas {{and that it is}} unknown what he believed on most doctrinal and confessional questions) points out that he was, at least, a nominal Lutheran.|$|E

25|$|The rufous fantail inhabits {{moist and}} {{moderately}} dense habitats. Within these areas, it has astonishingly large variations in habitat requirements. They {{can be found}} in eucalyptus forests, mangroves, rainforests and woodlands (usually near a river or swamp). Rarely, they have even been found in dry sclerophyll forests. Apart from open grasslands and open arid areas, there <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>many</b> major types of landscape in the Australo-Pauan region that cannot be inhabited by at least one subspecies of the rufous fantail.|$|E
25|$|Resource poor {{schools around}} the world rely on {{government}} support or on efforts from volunteers and private donations, in order to run effectively. In some countries, whenever the economy is down, the need for volunteers and resources increases greatly. There are many opportunities available in school systems for volunteers. Yet, there <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>many</b> requirements in order to volunteer in a school system. Whether one is a high school or TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) graduate or college student, most schools require just voluntary and selfless effort.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of the Jews under Almoravid domination was apparently free of major abuses, though {{there are reports of}} increasing social hostility against them – particularly in Fes. Unlike the problems encountered by the Jews during the rule of the Almohads (the Almoravids' successor dynasty), there <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>many</b> factual complaints of excesses, coercion, or malice {{on the part of the}} authorities toward the Jewish communities. It is known, however, that Yusuf Ibn Tashfin forbade Jews living in the capital city Marrakesh. It was allowed for them to trade there, but if a Jew was caught in the city during night hours it was punishable by death.|$|E

It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>many</b> moments' work for him to push part of the fire under the fence, and part of it against the pile of logs. The pitch-pines went off like rockets, driving the thirsty cattle back.|$|R
