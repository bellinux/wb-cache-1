25|$|The ISS {{employs a}} total of four CMGs as primary <b>actuating</b> <b>devices</b> during normal flight mode operation. The {{objective}} of the CMG flight control system is to hold the space station at a fixed attitude relative {{to the surface of the}} Earth. In addition, it seeks a Torque Equilibrium Attitude (TEA), in which the combined torque contribution of gravity gradient, atmospheric drag, solar pressure, and geomagnetic interactions are minimized. In the presence of these continual environmental disturbances CMGs absorb momentum in an attempt to maintain the space station at a desired attitude. The CMGs will eventually saturate (absorbing momentum to the point where they can absorb no more), resulting in loss of effectiveness of the CMG array for control. Some kind of momentum management scheme (MMS) is necessary to allow the CMGs to hold a desired attitude and at the same time prevent CMG saturation. Since the CMGs are momentum-exchange devices, external control torques must be used to desaturate the CMGs, that is, bring the momentum back to nominal value. Some methods for unloading CMG momentum include the use of magnetic torques, reaction thrusters, and gravity gradient torque. For the space station, the gravity gradient torque approach is preferred because it requires no consumables or external hardware and because the gravity-gradient torque on the ISS can be very high.|$|E

50|$|Piccard was the {{co-pilot}} for {{his wife}} Jeannette on {{the third and final}} voyage of the Century of Progress. The largest balloon in the world was conceived for him to fly at the World's Fair in 1933 but was flown there by US Navy pilots who were licensed. After this flight he created the liquid oxygen converter when the liquid failed to vaporize on descent after the cabin doors were open. Piccard developed a frost-free window, that was used on this flight and later by the Navy and Air Force in the B-24 Liberator or B-26 Marauder. He used blasting caps and TNT for releasing the balloon at launch and for remote release of external ballast from inside the sealed cabin. This was the first use of pyrotechnics for remote-controlled <b>actuating</b> <b>devices</b> in aircraft, an unpopular, revolutionary idea at the time. Later his student Robert R. Gilruth, who became the director of the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center, approved and used them in spacecraft.|$|E

The distances between respective measuring points (26 a- 26 c) and a measuring site (MO) are measured using the distance measuring device. The spatial alignment of the respective heliostat is determined {{based on the measured}} distances. <b>Actuating</b> <b>devices</b> of the heliostat are controlled using a processor (25) such that the heliostat assumes the alignment intended according to a solar altitude. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a heliostat field comprising heliostats.

A popular haptic device is the PHANTOM Omni, a six degree of freedom (6 DOF) positioning manipulator with 3 DOF force feedback. To increase the usability of the class of under <b>actuated</b> <b>devices</b> that include the common PHANTOM Omni, an impedance requiring full 6 DOF force feedback control law for under <b>actuated</b> <b>devices</b> based on a virtual mechanism (VM) was developed.

The control theory includes using a VM as a constraint for the RM. Weighted matrices and the pseudo inverse Jacobian control law place the VM as to minimize the error between the current RM position and somewhere on the path of the VM. A pseudo inverse Jacobian control law is used to generate a force to send to user of the RM.
