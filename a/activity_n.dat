40|$|ABSTRACT. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) were sampled (1995 – 96) from a {{mortality}} event {{near the}} Project Chariot site (the {{location of a}} radiotracer experiment in northwestern Alaska during the 1960 s) and reference sites. Radionuclide levels in muscle and bone and the cause(s) of the mortality were determined because of local residents ’ concerns. Bone gross alpha mean <b>activity</b> (<b>n</b> = 65) was 130. 0 Bq/kg, and varied significantly (p < 0. 01) from 73. 3 to 168. 0 Bq/kg among locations. Bone gross beta mean activity was 510. 4, and muscle gross beta mean activity was 9. 78 Bq/kg. Bone strontium- 90 mean <b>activity</b> (<b>n</b> = 58) was 137. 8 Bq/ kg. Muscle potassium- 40 mean <b>activity</b> (<b>n</b> = 65) was 83. 0 Bq/kg, and varied significantly from 76. 0 to 104. 4 Bq/kg among locations. Muscle cesium- 137 mean <b>activity</b> (<b>n</b> = 65) was 6. 67 Bq/kg, ranged significantly from 0. 74 to 15. 6 Bq/kg by location, and increased with increasing body condition score. Bone potassium- 40 mean activity ranged from 18. 9 to 47. 4 Bq/kg, and muscle strontium- 90 ranged from 8. 89 to 20. 0 Bq/kg. Radionuclide concentrations were at expected levels. In some cases, they were low compared to those in Canadian caribou studies...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{first step}} in iron {{absorption}} requires the reduction of ferric iron to ferrous iron, a change that is catalyzed by duodenal ferric reductase. Iron deficiency is associated with high iron absorp-tion, high ferric reductase activity, and high duodenal ascorbate concentrations in experimental animals, {{but it is not}} known whether a relation between reductase and ascorbate is evident in humans. Objective: The objective {{of the study was to}} assess the relation between ferric reductase activity in human duodenal biopsy speci-mens and ascorbate concentrations in iron-replete and iron-deficient subjects. Design: Patients and control subjects were overnight-fasted adults presenting sequentially for upper gastrointestinal endoscopic inves-tigation. Ferric reductase activity in duodenal biopsy specimens was assayed by using nitroblue tetrazolium. Ascorbate was assayed in duodenal biopsy specimens and plasma. Results: Iron-deficient patients had significantly higher reductase <b>activity</b> (<b>n</b> 6 – 9; P 0. 05) and duodenal (n 20; P 0. 001) and plasma (n 6; P 0. 001) ascorbate concentrations than did control subjects. Incubation of biopsy specimens with dehydroascorbate (to boost cellular ascorbate) increased reductase activity in the tissues that initially had normal <b>activity</b> (<b>n</b> 9; P 0. 01) but inhibited reductase activity in the tissues that already had high reductase <b>activity</b> (<b>n</b> 13; P 0. 001). Conclusions: Iron deficiency in humans is associated with increased duodenal ascorbate concentrations. This finding suggests that in-creased reductase activity is partly due to an increase in this substrat...|$|E

40|$|Using a {{subsample}} of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY 97), {{this study}} (N = 2, 471) provides {{evidence in support}} of social capital and socialization theories. Intergenerational transmission of civic engagement activities was found to occur through mechanisms such as parental religiosity and voluntarism. Using multinomial logistic regression analysis, correlates of four types of civic engagement were examined: mixed motivation voluntarism (voluntary participation in activist and nonactivist <b>activities,</b> <b>n</b> = 401), exclusively activist (n = 109), exclusive voluntarism (n = 652), and as the ref-erent non–civic minded (no voluntary participation in either activist or nonactivist <b>activities,</b> <b>n</b> = 1, 309). Parental voluntarism, socialization, religious participation, education, and presence of children were found to be robust predictors of mixed motivation voluntarism; parental devotion, presence of children, and race/ethnicity, of exclusive activism; and parental religious affiliation and fundamentalism, socialization, and religious participation, self-perceived sense of trustfulness, presence of children, and race/ethnicity of exclusive voluntarism...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Cardiac vagal {{activity}} {{is now considered}} as an important therapeutic target. However, {{there is a lack}} of direct data on how cardiac vagal motoneurons respond to parasympathomimetic agents. METHODS: Rats were anesthetized with urethane and mechanically ventilated. Single-unit activity was recorded in the nucleus ambiguus from cardiac vagal motoneurons, identified by antidromic activation from the cardiac vagal branch and their barosensitivity. RESULTS: Nitroprusside lowered systolic blood pressure, increased heart rate and inhibited cardiac vagal motoneuron <b>activity</b> (<b>n</b> = 5 cells in five rats). Clonidine 1 - 100 microg kg(- 1) intravenously, however, lowered systolic blood pressure, but it increased cardiac vagal motoneuron <b>activity</b> (<b>n</b> = 8 cells in eight rats). It also enhanced their barosensitivity. An unsuspected further finding was that clonidine significantly increased the occurrence of cardiac vagal motoneuron firing spikes separated by short (< 30 ms) interspike intervals ('doublet'). CONCLUSION: Such grouped patterns are known to enhance neurotransmitter release. Therefore, these data provide a new mechanism by which clonidine can further potentiate parasympathetic actions on the heart...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether the in vitro activity and concentration of Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumolysin correlated to the pathogenesis of S. pneumoniae endophthalmitis. Five S. pneumoniae clinical endophthalmitis strains were grown in media to similar optical densities (OD), and extracellular milieu was tested for pneumolysin activity by hemolysis of rabbit red blood cells. Pneumolysin concentration was determined using a sandwich ELISA. Rabbit vitreous was injected with 102 colony-forming units (CFU) of 1 of 2 different strains with low hemolytic <b>activity</b> (<b>n</b> = 10 and 12 for strains 4 and 5, respectively) or 1 of 3 different strains with high hemolytic <b>activity</b> (<b>n</b> = 12 per strain). Pathogenesis of endophthalmitis infection was graded by slit lamp examination (SLE) at 24 hours post-infection. Bacteria were recovered from infected vitreous and quantitated. The SLE scores of eyes infected with strains having high hemolytic activity were significantly higher than the scores of those infected with strains having low hemolytic activity (P 0. 05). These data suggest that pneumolysin hemolytic activity in vitro directly correlates to the pathogenesis of S. pneumoniae endophthalmitis. The protein concentration of pneumolysin, however, is not a reliable indicator of pneumolysin activity...|$|E

The experimental layout was a 4 x 3 complete factorial experiment with three replicates, arranged in a randomized design. Soil pH, CO 2 evolution, and mineral N concentration were measured. After 56 days the soil pH ranged from 4. 50 to 5. 74 and 4. 99 to 5. 94, in the Magusheni and Nikwe soils, respectively. The effect of liming on microbial <b>activity</b> and <b>N</b> mineralization differed between the soils. In the Nikwe soil (acid saturation 4. 0 %), microbial <b>activity</b> and <b>N</b> mineralization increased as the rate of broiler manure application was raised, but liming had no effect. In the Magusheni soil (acid saturation 25 %), microbial activity increased as both lime and chicken manure application rates increased, but liming reduced N mineralization, suggesting N immobilization was being driven by an active microbial population in the limed soils. The rates of lime and/or chicken manure application, percentage Ca 2 + and soil acid saturation were important factors influencing microbial <b>activity</b> and <b>N</b> mineralization, but the effect of soil pH on N mineralization was not evident in either of the soils...|$|R

40|$|Objective—Plant-derived -linolenic acid (ALA) may {{constitute}} an attractive cardioprotective alternative to fish-derived n- 3 fatty acids. However, {{the effect of}} dietary ALA on arterial thrombus formation remains unknown. Methods and Results—Male C 57 Bl/ 6 mice were fed a high-ALA or low-ALA diet for 2 weeks. Arterial thrombus formation was delayed in mice fed a high-ALA diet compared with those on a low-ALA diet (n 7; P 0. 005). Dietary ALA impaired platelet aggregation to collagen and thrombin (n 5; P 0. 005) and decreased p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in platelets. Dietary ALA impaired arterial tissue factor (TF) expression, TF activity, and nuclear factor-B <b>activity</b> (<b>n</b> 7; P 0. 05); plasma clotting times and plasma thrombin generation did not differ (n 5; Pnot significant). In cultured human vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells, ALA inhibited TF expression and <b>activity</b> (<b>n</b> 4; P 0. 01). Inhibition of TF expression occurred {{at the transcriptional level}} via the mitogen-activated protein kinase p 38 in smooth muscle cells and p 38, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2, and c-Jun N-terminal kinases 1 and 2 in endothelial cells. Conclusion—ALA impairs arterial thrombus formation, TF expression, and platelet activation and thereby represents an attractive nutritional intervention with direct dual antithrombotic effects.
