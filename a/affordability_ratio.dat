40|$|China has {{the largest}} housing {{market in the world}} and the {{property}} market continues to advance at an astonishing pace. In 2009, 22. 2 % of China's RMB 19. 3 trillion fixed asset investment and 17. 9 % of foreign direct investment were invested into the real estate sector. At the same time, the highly dynamic market structure and huge regional disparities in China created mixed interpretation and confusion. Nationwide statistics blending urban and suburban prices and the indifferent treatment towards subsidized housing and private housing overshadowed the actual development on the local level. With unprecedented investment pouring into the Chinese real estate market and sky rocketing property prices in most major cities, the legendary short-seller James Chanos described the Chinese real estate sector as "Dubai times 1, 000 - or worse". Yet, another American financial guru Jim Rogers openly debunked the statement from James Chanos and remained his bullish views on China. This thesis is divided into two sections. First it reviews the historical development from the Chinese property market. The paper explores the current situation of the market and focuses on the affordability comparison between the national level and the local levels. On a national level, housing prices grow at a pace similar to China's GDP growth supported by an even faster growth in income levels. <b>Affordability</b> <b>ratios</b> are in line with international standards and below the levels experienced by Japan and US during their bubble era. At the local level, different cities experienced drastic differences in price growth and supply surpluses. In some cities, even the suburban areas are beyond the affordability of an average household. In the second section, this paper explores the development of affordable housing, the new frontier of Chinese real estate market. The emergence of the affordable housing market together with new housing policies has different implications and opportunities to the incumbent property developers as well as potential low-end disruptors in China. This paper concludes with recommendations on some of the available investment options for a bearish investor in the Chinese real estate market. by Terence T. Lam. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Triggered by {{the state}} of the housing market and a change in the housing {{association}} subsidy system, housing affordability became a topical issue of discourse in Britain {{towards the end of the}} 1980 s. Yet, there is little research both on the extent of the problem at the national level and how affordability should be measured. This research attempts to advance understanding in these issues based on data from the 1991 Family Expenditure Survey and the 1988 General Household Survey. In this thesis, a new definition of the residual income measurement has been proposed and threshold <b>affordability</b> <b>ratios</b> has also been established using a composite approach to affordability measurement combining the ratio and the residual income measurement, in additional to an experimentation on a behavioral approach to the measurement of affordability. Findings in this thesis suggest that, measured by the ratio measurement and the traditional residual income measurement, about a quarter of households in 1991 were in unaffordable housing. Social tenants and tenants in the unfurnished private rented sector, lone parents, the elderly persons and households with unemployed household heads and claimants of housing benefit were more likely to be in unaffordable housing. However, there is no evidence in support of distinct patterns in household expenditure between households who were affordable to housing and those who were unaffordable. It is also controversial to regard households who were unaffordable to housing but at the same time over-consumiing housing to be in voluntary unaffordability problem owing to the difficulties such households would have in adjusting their level of housing consumption. This thesis also points to the close relationship between housing affordability, housing benefit and social tenancy which suggests the inadequacy of the housing benefit system and state provision of housing in protecting households from the problem of housing affordability. A section of this thesis was devoted to the examination of the ability of tenants to buy in the late 1980 s where tenure preference has been incorporated in the measurement of such ability. It was found that the majority of tenants in 1988 could not afford to buy and tenants living in London and the South East, single person households, lone parents and households on a low income were the least able to afford buying. Though the Right to Buy scheme would improve the capacity of these households in council housing to become home owners, they are still households who were the least able to buy...|$|R
40|$|Much of the {{literature}} considering the historic development of housing systems has focussed on the factors contributing to similarities and differences in housing policies, rather than on questioning their significance to housing outcomes. This study suggests that fresh insights may be gained into the importance of differences in housing policy strategy by analysing their consequences. Two countries, Australia and the Netherlands, with contrasting approaches to intervention in housing, while similar in many other respects, {{have been used to}} examine whether and to what extent differences in housing policy are significant to low income households. In keeping with the thesis that countries can achieve similar housing outcomes through different policy strategies, the study finds a strong similarity in the extent of affordable housing that has been provided using different policy means: assisted home ownership in Australia and deeply subsidised social housing in the Netherlands. A second finding is that the increasing reliance being placed on market housing in both countries is not proving as successful as past, strongly government-assisted strategies. The significance of this finding to the future is underlined by data showing in aggregate that most growth in households in the lowest two quintiles of the income distribution is being absorbed into the least affordable tenures (to them) at present: the home purchase sector in the Netherlands and the private rental sector in Australia. Third, the last two decades been characterised by deteriorating affordability for low income households generally, although the severity of the change varies both between the countries studied and within each, by tenure and other factors. Other empirical findings expose important differences and divergent tendencies in the housing situation of low income households. First, the geography of affordability is very different. In Australia, there are much larger cost differentials between inter and intra-urban housing markets. Urban and regional price differentials in the Netherlands are much more muted, although that situation may be changing, as a more privatised land development system develops. Second, equity within the low income group differs. In the Netherlands, differences in affordability within the low income segment are much less extreme between tenures and age groups than those in Australia. Third, there are differences in the trade-offs that low income households make to obtain affordable housing. In general, the Netherlands has more smaller and higher density housing, affecting the choices of lower and higher income households alike. In Australia, many low income households in the rental sectors have poorer quality housing, as well as worse <b>affordability</b> <b>ratios,</b> compared to their counterparts who are home buyers/owners. The study concludes that four interconnected aspects of housing policy strategy have had the most influence on the evolution of the similarities and differences in housing affordability outcomes for low income households: ? the short and long run impact of housing policies favouring home ownership; ? the type and extent of urban policies geared to the provision of affordable housing; ? the role, organisation and capacity of social rental housing; and ? the effectiveness of demand side subsidies...|$|R
40|$|Housing {{became more}} {{expensive}} in the Netherlands between 2002 and 2006, a trend {{which has been}} demonstrated using various measures of <b>affordability.</b> The expenditure-to-income <b>ratios</b> calculated for households confirm that {{the average cost of}} housing rose for tenants and homeowners, as well as for most income groups generally. This contribution analyses the development of various components of household expenditure which contributed to these higher ratios. One of the most important considerations here is the fact that average household disposable incomes either fell (tenants) or remained stable (homeowners) during the four-year period under review. This leads {{to the question of whether}} these increasing income differences between renting and owning can be attributed to the business cycle alone, or whether they are part of a longer-term trend that will eventually result in a rental sector that provides housing for those on lower incomes. The findings suggest that a longer-term or structural widening of the income gap between renting and owning may indeed be taking place. OTB onderzoekOTB Research Institut...|$|R
40|$|Defence date: 3 May 2016 Examining Board: Professor Russell Cooper, Penn State University, Supervisor; Professor Piero Gottardi, EUI; Dr. Stefano Corradin, ECB; Professor Tony Yates, University of Birmingham. This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of three separate and self-contained chapters on two different areas: (i) reputation building and competition in on-line markets, and (ii) the heterogeneous transmission of monetary policy to household consumption expenditures and income. The first chapter investigates how sellers’ strategic competition for high valuation buyers shapes reputation building incentives in a setting resembling an on-line market, and how it determines the dynamics of prices and reputation itself. Sellers repeatedly auction off a good to a pool of short-lived buyers; efforts and valuations are private information. Ceteris paribus, as the reputation of competitors increase (intensity of competition), a seller's incentive to exert effort that helps to successfully complete a transaction decrease. This "intensity" of competition effect, however, quickly disappears {{as the number of}} buyers in the market increases, providing a motivation for the use of equilibrium concepts such as "oblivious equilibrium", in which the only payoff relevant reputation is the average one. The second chapter shifts focus to household expenditure, debt and monetary policy. It is shown that, in response to an interest rate change, mortgagors (i. e. households that own a house with a mortgage) in the U. K. and U. S. adjust their spending significantly (especially on durable goods) but outright home-owners (i. e. households that own a house outright) do not. While the dollar change in mortgage payments is nearly three times larger in the U. K. than in the U. S., these magnitudes are much smaller than the overall change in expenditure. In contrast, the income change is sizable and similar across both household groups and countries. Consistent with the predictions of a simple heterogeneous agents model with credit-constrained households and multi-period fixed-rate debt contracts, our evidence suggests that the general equilibrium effect of monetary policy on income is quantitatively more important than the direct effect on cash-flows. Finally, the third chapter exploits individual mortgage data in the UK to try to further understand the role of mortgagor's balance sheets in the transmission of monetary policy. Estimation results point in the direction of significant heterogeneity in two dimensions: (i) in the response of observed leverage (loan-to-value) and <b>affordability</b> (loan-to-income) <b>ratios</b> at the time of origination for the median mortgagor, and (ii) the response of LTVs for households that are first-time-buyers and those that are non-first-time-buyers...|$|R
