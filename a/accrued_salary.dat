40|$|In the article, the {{statistical}} {{tests of the}} empirical distributions of economic indicators of the Russian Federation in 2011 (average monthly nominal <b>accrued</b> <b>salary,</b> the unemployment rate), the unemployment rate of {{the countries of the}} European Union in 2011, on conformity to their normal distribution law (distribution fitting) are made. On the basis of the calculation of {{the statistical}} criterion of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, (K-S test) the distributions being not normal distributions is proved. Therefore, for their characteristics it is inappropriate to use the arithmetic mean as indicators of economic status and development. For the selected empirical distributions of the calculations of such indicators descriptive statistics, as the median, the lower and upper quartiles, interquartile range are conducted, the advantages of graphical representation of the data {{in the form of a}} chart «box and whisker» are shown. On the example of the two Russian districts of the Southern Federal district and the Volga Federal district, the comparison of the average monthly salary in 2010 with the help of nonparametric test Mann-Whitney U test is carried out, the difference in the interpretation of data compared with the use of simple averages is shown. The results of the performed calculations can be used for the analysis of economic indicators average monthly salary and the unemployment rate in 83 subjects of the Russian Federation in 2011, the unemployment rate in the EU countries in 2011, as well as the methodology of statistical analysis of the different empirical distribution economic indicator...|$|E
40|$|Background : ischemic {{heart disease}} {{represents}} a major challenge given {{the large number of}} people affected by this condition, its increasing contribution to overall mortality, the frequent disability resulting from it, and the complexity and high cost of its treatment. Objective: to describe the work disability caused by {{ischemic heart disease}} in patients treated at the internal medicine consultation and assessed by the Expert Medical Labor Commission of Cienfuegos municipality. Methods: a cross-sectional study was conducted including all patients with ischemic heart disease treated at the internal medicine consultation and assessed by the Expert Medical Labor Commission of Cienfuegos municipality from October 2012 to July 2013. The variables analyzed were: age, sex, occupation, years of work and <b>accrued</b> <b>salary,</b> clinical diagnosis, length of time the condition had been present and associated chronic diseases; existence of prior assessment by an Expert Medical Labor Commission and decision reached, previous days of sick leave and current decision of the commission. The data were analyzed using SPSS (version 18. 0) and the results are shown in tables and graphs as numbers and percentages. Results: a predominance of men was observed. Forty two point nine percent were service workers and the average number of years of work was 24. 60. Forty two point nine percent were previously assessed by the commission. Two hundred one point thirteen days of sick leave were granted and social security expenditure in a month was high. Diabetes mellitus was the most common chronic disease followed by hypertension, obesity and dyslipidemia. Of the workers previously assessed, half received permanent and temporary disability benefits. Conclusions: ischemic heart disease causes different degrees of disability. Its costs in terms of social security are increasing...|$|E
50|$|On June 30, 2005 the NLRC {{confirmed}} of {{a backlog}} of 4,922 cases in NCR and {{a backlog of}} 8,808 cases in the regional arbitration branches. NLRC Chairman Benedicto Ernesto R. Bitonio Jr. announced a three-year master plan which {{was approved by the}} NLRC en banc committee. They aim to clear all the backlogs by 2008, this would entail each of the 15 NLRC commissioners to resolve 57.2 cases per month while each of the 105 labor arbiters must dispose of 25.3 cases per month. In 2006, the NLRC’s third division had confirmed resolving 2,697 labor disputes, which gave the division the highest disposition rating of 60 percent among the three divisions in Luzon. As of March 2011, the NLRC has yet to show effort that they indeed have plans to clear all backlogs. Pending cases appealed on 2007 still has yet to be touched. In February 28, 2011 Arbiter Jose G. de Vera who declined to issue a Writ of Partial Execution as motioned by the complainants on the grounds of <b>accrued</b> <b>salaries</b> on Reinstatement aspect of the appealed case, issued an order inhibiting himself from the case. He has been pressured by the respondents to delay and hold issuance of such writ for their personal gains. The case was re-raffled to Arbiter Macam and immediately, an Alias Writ of Execution was issued.|$|R

500|$|Following the war, Smythe {{returned}} to Toronto. With his <b>accrued</b> Army <b>salary</b> and {{the proceeds from}} the sale of his homestead plot, he [...] started a sand and gravel business. For a while, the business became a partnership with Frank Angotti, who owned a paving business. To support the need for sand and gravel, Smythe bought land northwest of Toronto for a sand pit. He {{returned to}} the University of Toronto and finished his civil engineering degree in 1920. Irene and Conn were married during the school year. Smythe and his paving business partner split, and Smythe retained the sand and gravel business. The company was named C. Smythe Limited and the company slogan was [...] "C. Smythe for sand", which he had painted on his trucks, the lettering in white on the blue of the trucks. Frank Selke, who had moved to Toronto, was one of Smythe's first employees in the business. Irene took sand and gravel orders over the phone as well as taking care of newborn son Stafford. Smythe would own the business until 1961.|$|R
6000|$|About {{this time}} she also gave a party--not a pure-minded conversazione like Mrs. Proudie, but a downright wicked worldly dance, at which there were fiddles, ices, and {{champagne}} sufficient to run away with the first quarter's <b>salary</b> <b>accruing</b> to Harold from the Petty Bag Office. To us this ball is chiefly memorable {{from the fact that}} Lady Lufton was among the guests. Immediately on her arrival in town she received cards from Mrs. H. Smith for herself and Griselda, and was about to send back a reply at once declining the honour. What had she to do at the house of Mr. Sowerby's sister? But it so happened that at that moment her son was with her, and as he expressed a wish that she should go, she yielded. Had there been nothing in his tone of persuasion more than ordinary,--had it merely had reference to herself,--she would have smiled on him for his kind solicitude, have made out some occasion for kissing his forehead as she thanked him, and would still have declined. But he had reminded her both of himself and Griselda. [...] "You might as well go, mother, for the sake of meeting me," [...] he said; [...] "Mrs. Harold caught me the other day, and would not liberate me till I had given her a promise." ...|$|R
