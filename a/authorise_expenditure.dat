From 1921 to 1923 the Government had expended ₤352,790 on the project. [...] However the port company had failed in its attempts to create an inner harbour at Waikokopu, and the Government had to <b>authorise</b> <b>expenditure</b> of a further ₤78,000 for 'the immediate erection of safe berthing facilities'. [...] The work was speedily completed, and the first of many shipments of frozen meat went out via the new railway line and port in August 1924. [...] During further development of the port in 1925 the ship Talune was stripped, filled with rocks and sunk to form a breakwater to protect the wharf from the Southerly swells. The Talune was notorious as the ship on which the 1918 pandemic influenza reached Samoa, killing over 20% of the population.|$|E

Local authorities should pay particular regard to the legislation governing publicity {{during the period of}} heightened sensitivity before elections and referendums - see paragraphs 7 to 9 of this code. It may be necessary to suspend the hosting of material produced by third parties, or to close public forums during this period to avoid breaching any legal restrictions.34. During the period between the notice of an election and the election itself, local authorities should not publish any publicity on controversial issues or report views or proposals {{in such a way that}} identifies them with any individual members or groups of members. Publicity relating to individuals involved directly in the election should not be published by local authorities during this period unless expressly authorised by or under statute. It is permissible for local authorities to publish factual information which identifies the names, wards and parties of candidates at elections.35. In general, local authorities should not issue any publicity which seeks to influence voters. However this general principle is subject to any statutory provision which <b>authorises</b> <b>expenditure</b> being incurred on the publication of material designed to influence the public as to whether to support or oppose a question put at a referendum. It is acceptable to publish material relating to the subject matter of a referendum, for example to correct any factual inaccuracies which have appeared in publicity produced by third parties, so long as this is even-handed and objective and does not support or oppose any of the options which are the subject of the vote.|$|R

50|$|On 20 May 1861, Bartholomew {{met with}} Mr. Wilson and Mr. Warde-Aldam, the company chairman, and they {{discussed}} {{the possibility of}} using iron compartments, which would be filled with coal, and emptied by a hoist at Goole. Bartholomew thought that a compartment holding 30 tons would be ideal, although Warde-Aldam recommended 25 tons. The plan was to use six compartments, sandwiched between a bow and a stern compartment, which would be towed like a conventional boat. The hoist would be hydraulic, and they were already considering the introduction of hydraulic power at Goole to operate the locks. On 20 December 1861, a board meeting <b>authorised</b> the <b>expenditure</b> of £13,382, which would include three 'train boats' costing £1,100 each, a hoist at £2,500, and the hydraulic equipment to operate both the lock and the hoist.|$|R

25|$|One of Clark's least {{successful}} acts {{as director}} was buying four early-sixteenth century paintings {{now known as}} Scenes from Tebaldeo's Eclogues. He saw them in 1937 {{in the possession of}} a dealer in Vienna, and against the united advice of his professional staff he persuaded the trustees to buy them. He believed them to be by Giorgione, whose work was inadequately represented in the gallery at the time. The trustees <b>authorised</b> the <b>expenditure</b> of £14,000 of public funds and the paintings went on display in the gallery with considerable fanfare. His staff did not accept the attribution to Giorgione, and within a year scholarly research established the paintings as the work of Andrea Previtali, one of Giorgione's minor contemporaries. The British press protested at the waste of taxpayers' money, Clark's reputation suffered a considerable blow, and his relations with his professional team, already uneasy, were further strained.|$|R

50|$|Although the Prime Minister and Treasurer, by convention, {{are members}} of the House of Representatives (after John Gorton was {{appointed}} prime minister in 1968, he resigned from the Senate and was elected to the House), other members of the Cabinet may come from either house, and the two Houses have almost equal legislative power. As with most upper chambers in bicameral parliaments, the Senate cannot introduce or amend appropriation bills (bills that <b>authorise</b> government <b>expenditure</b> of public revenue) or bills that impose taxation, that role being reserved for the lower house, it can only approve, reject or defer them. That degree of equality between the Senate and House of Representatives reflects the desire of the Constitution's authors to address smaller states' desire for strong powers for the Senate as a way of ensuring that the interests of more populous states as represented in the House of Representatives did not totally dominate the government. This situation was also partly due to the age of the Australian constitution - it was enacted before the confrontation in 1909 in Britain between the House of Commons and the House of Lords, which ultimately resulted in the restrictions placed on the powers of the House of Lords by the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949.|$|R
40|$|MCom (Management Accountancy), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 In 2009 Operation Clean Audit was {{launched}} {{with the objective}} that all municipalities must achieve a clean audit by the 2014 financial year. A clean audit is an audit opinion when the financial statements are unqualified; no adverse findings were identified on compliance with laws and regulations {{as well as on}} predetermined objectives. The overall aim of the programme is to clean up the governance of municipalities and to enhance service delivery. In both the public and the private sector internal control is crucial. It is seen as one of the key elements of good governance, it provides assurance of the rendering of reliable financial statements, of compliance with legislation and it also indicates how the organisation performs against its objectives. Budgetary control in local government can be used as an effective internal control method by legally limiting the <b>authorised</b> <b>expenditure</b> and to monitor the actual service delivery against the budgeted targets. If variances are identified in the budget or with regard to service delivery objectives, remedial action can be taken. If municipalities do not provide services to communities in a sustainable manner, it contravenes its constitutional mandate as stipulated in section 152 (1) (b) of the Constitution of South Africa. The qualitative research method, in the format of a case study of the Tlokwe City Council, a local municipality in the North West Province, was chosen for this research. In the 2010 financial year, the Auditor General reflected that the Tlokwe City Council experienced deficiencies in the key fundamentals of internal control: leadership, financial and performance management, and governance which could directly be linked to the basis of the qualification of the financial statements, findings on predetermined objectives and compliance with legislation. The material underspending of the capital budget was also found to be affecting service delivery negatively. The {{purpose of this study is}} to benchmark the internal budgetary control systems of municipalities in South Africa, which have already achieved clean audit reports for consecutive years, to improve the internal budgetary control system of the Tlokwe City Council. This research was formulated in such a way that — through the findings obtained in the literature study with regard to the legislative framework regulating the budget formulation, internal and budgetary control of the local government sphere in South Africa, analysis of the internal budgetary control deficiencies at the Tlokwe City Council and the benchmarking exercise with the Swartland and Steve Tshwete local municipalities — a strategy can be developed to provide for effective budgeting and to improve the internal control system of the Tlokwe City Council. Potential benefits that can arise from the implementation of the recommended strategy to improve the internal budgetary control system of the Tlokwe City Council are the attainment of a clean audit opinion by the Auditor General and subsequently the enhancement of service delivery to the community.

5000|$|Tourist {{traffic was}} a vital {{contributor}} to passenger revenue. In 1863, a shareholders' meeting <b>authorised</b> the <b>expenditure</b> of £11,000 {{on the construction}} of a first-class railway hotel; such a hotel, the directors had urged, was essential if Keswick was to compete with the Scottish lochs and Switzerland. By 1865, when the hotel had been built, it was evident that the capital cost of the railway had overrun to an alarming extent; the LNWR advised strongly (and the NER concurred) that railway hotels were not profitable when run by railway companies; furthermore it was now thought that the hotel needed to be extended before anyone could run it profitably. The hotel was therefore sold to a separate company, floated for the purpose, with a considerably overlapping directorate, and with railway shareholders being given first refusal on the hotel company shares. [...] Keswick also attracted day trips (works outings, Sunday school treats) from Carlisle and industrial West Cumberland, and was a popular venue for Temperance demonstrations, although much depended on the weather:Soon after the departure from Carlisle the rain commenced to fall in heavy showers, and continued throughout the whole of the day without the slightest perceptible abatement. Between eleven and twelve o'clock the whole of the excursion trains had arrived, and the streets of Keswick were literally crowded by an immense concourse of people, whose wet and weary appearance indicated the entire absence of enjoyment. It was impossible to look upon the drifting multitude without feelings of compassion. Those local places of interest which have given to Keswick an attractive reputation were unvisited, and the people seemed to wander from the tea rooms to the public-houses during the whole day … If the weather had been propitious, the Demonstration would have proved a marked success, for seldom has such {{a large number of people}} accompanied an excursion to Keswick. As the excursionists returned to the station towards evening, a more reliable estimate could be formed of the number present, which was represented by several thousands. Beyond a few expressions of sympathy with some loitering excursionists who missed the homeward train, nothing transpired in the shape of an accident to call forth regret save the serious weather, which reminded many of the not altogether groundless proverb that, [...] "it always rains at Keswick" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{realisation}} {{that the}} St Mary Guildhall was not specifically {{built for the}} Great Guild of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and, that it was built at sometime previous to 1251/2, when it was acquired by the Guild, opens up {{the possibility that it}} had been a Royal Palace or hospicium, where and Henry II had a crown wearing or second crowning. This ceremony took place in 1157 on a visit to the city at Christmas[...] Henry II had a number of provincial palaces including those at Oxford, Gloucester, and Winchester. The existence of one in Lincoln is known from the chroniceler Roger of Hoveden [...] Roger refers to a palace in the suburb of Wigford in Lincoln. Also in the same year Henry <b>authorised</b> the <b>expenditure</b> of £7/15/- on the repairs to the Hospicium and the expenditure of £30 on his retinue of huntsmen, squires and others who accompanied him there. David Stocker has argued that by far the most likely building in Wigford to have been Henry’s Palace would have been the Guildhall. Architectural stone fragments from the building, particularly those with acanthus scrolls and volutes can be fairly closely dated to the period 1150-70 and this would fit in with the date of the building Guildhall. The mention of [...] "repairs" [...] (in reparatione) in 1157 was a term that often indicated the final expenses on completion of a building. Stockers main case rests {{on the fact that the}} St Mary Guildhall was built on a much grander scale than the other Romanesque Houses in Lincoln, such as the Norman House, Jew's House and the St Andrew's Hall. He points out that the first floor great hall of the Guildhall with its arcaded decoration, measures 20m. by 6.5m, which makes it amongst the largest in a surviving building of the 12th century. Details of other Royal Halls are discussed in [...] "The History of the Kings Works". However, the earlier ownership of Guildhall as constructed by Johnson does not fully fit this idea, even though the property was certainly owned by King Henry III. Johnson deduces that the property was originally owned by John de Holm (whose son, Adam was the first Mayor of Lincoln until 1216). John de Holm sold the Guildhall in 1228, via John le Marshall to King Henry. The King appears to have used the building for wine storage and then disposed of it to his butler, de la Burne in 1250, who almost immediately sold it to the Guild of St Mary in 1250/1. However, as there is some uncertainty about the property boundaries, and it may be that Henry III was adding a further property to the one he already owned, this does not necessarily rule out the idea that Guildhall was originally a Royal palace.|$|R
