500|$|In Chinese literature, {{ailanthus}} {{is often}} used for two rather extreme metaphors, with a mature tree representing {{a father and a}} stump being a spoiled child. This manifests itself occasionally when expressing best wishes to a friend's father and mother in a letter, where one can write [...] "wishing your ailanthus and daylily are strong and happy", with ailanthus metaphorically referring to the father and daylily to the mother. Furthermore, one can scold a child by calling him a [...] "good-for-nothing ailanthus stump sprout", meaning the child is irresponsible. This derives from the literature of Zhuangzi, a Taoist philosopher, who referred to a tree that had developed from a sprout <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> and was thus unsuitable for carpentry due to its irregular shape. Later scholars associated this tree with ailanthus and applied the metaphor to children who, like stump sprouts of the tree, will not develop into a worthwhile human being if they don't follow rules or traditions.|$|E
500|$|The current {{coat of arms}} {{consists}} of numerous traditional heraldic attributes. The shield is party per fess argent and gules; that is, split horizontally in two with a red lower half and silver upper half. Its lower half contains two golden sheaves of wheat on a red background; this design represents Albany's agricultural past. The upper half, which has a silver background, depicts a beaver gnawing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> of a fallen tree. This scene represents Beverwyck's former fur trade, which was vital {{to the development of}} Albany. One supporter can be seen {{on each side of the}} shield. The man on the left is a European-descended farmer dressed in simple clothes; he is supporting the shield with his left hand. His right hand rests on his hip and a sickle hangs from his waist; this references Albany's former agricultural society. The man on the right is an American Indian dressed in a loin cloth and wearing moccasins and a quiver. He supports the shield with his right hand and holds a bow over his left shoulder. The two men supporting the shield together represent the cooperation between white immigrants and Indians in the early development of the city, which would not have existed without the Indian fur trade. The men stand on a scroll displaying the motto Assiduity, meaning [...] "the quality of acting with constant and careful attention". The torse is argent and gules, following the pattern of the shield. The crest is a sloop under full sail facing left, [...] "denoting Albany's supremacy at the head of the sloop navigation of the Hudson River". The coat of arms represents the [...] "symbols of industry and its rewards to man and beast on land and sea". At the time of Albany's bicentennial (1886), it was believed that only New York City and Albany possessed arms charged on a shield upheld by supporters.|$|E

25|$|He {{was indeed}} the ideal fast bowler, aiming <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps,</b> always on <b>the</b> attack. His leap before the right arm wheeled over was superb in poise. Never did he send down a {{defensive}} ball. He {{would have been too}} proud.|$|R

25|$|The {{point of}} release is the {{position}} of the ball in relation to <b>the</b> body <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moment when the ball is released. It is crucial for the arm to be stiff, not bent, and the wrist rather looser, to ensure smooth release of the ball, and sufficient bounce off the pitch. Otherwise, the action will resemble chucking. The left shoulder ought to be somewhat towards <b>the</b> <b>stumps,</b> <b>the</b> arm beside the bowler falling away, having just before this stage been pointing directly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no, my dear, no," [...] muttered absently Mr. Vinck, with a vague gesture. The {{aspect of}} Willems as a wife-beater {{presented}} to him no interest. How women do misjudge! If Willems wanted to torture his wife {{he would have}} recourse to less primitive methods. Mr. Vinck knew Willems well, and believed him to be very able, very smart--objectionably so. As he took the last quick draws <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> of his cheroot, Mr. Vinck reflected that the confidence accorded by Hudig to Willems was open, under the circumstances, to loyal criticism from Hudig's cashier.|$|E
6000|$|My {{brain was}} in a whirl as all these details {{presented}} themselves to my mind, and I was greatly {{at a loss to}} decide on my course. In order to gain time for reflection, I stopped a moment <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump,</b> and whispered to the Onondago a request that he would remain where he was until I could give him his orders. An expressive [...] "good" [...] was the answer I received, and I observed that the Indian crouched lower in his lair, like some fierce animal of the woods, that restrained his impatience, in order to make his leap, when it did come, more certain and fatal.|$|E
60|$|Farmer Brown's boy {{sat with}} his chin in his hands staring at the new pond in the Green Forest and at the dam which had made it. That dam puzzled him. Who could have built it? What did they build it for? Why hadn't he heard them chopping? He looked {{carelessly}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> {{of one of the}} trees, and then a still more puzzled look made deep furrows between his eyes. It looked-- yes, it looked very much as if teeth, and not an axe, had cut down that tree. Farmer Brown's boy stared and stared, his mouth gaping wide open. He looked so funny that Peter Rabbit, who was hiding under an old pile of brush close by, nearly laughed right out.|$|E
50|$|England had a mixed {{series in}} the field against India. While Jonny Bairstow was {{impressive}} behind <b>the</b> <b>stumps,</b> England dropped chances in <b>the</b> field <b>at</b> important times in the game which ended up costing them. They ended up losing the five match Test series 4-0. England lost the ODI series 2-1 and at times fielding poorly with several missed attempts <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps.</b> Although their fielding was sharp in the T20I side, they lost it 2-1.|$|R

5000|$|... 3rd ball : The third ball saw Klusener mis-hit {{his shot}} to Darren Lehmann, who was {{standing}} at mid-on. Allan Donald was backing up a long way <b>at</b> <b>the</b> non-striker's end, and if Lehmann's close range throw <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> had hit, Donald would have been easily run out. Mike Proctor remarked [...] "that could {{be the difference between}} a World Cup final or nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{have done}} so twice. I was very careful, however, as I feared they might be watching. I did not wait for the lighted one to burn out, but passed the other one out, putting {{the end of my}} poncho round my hand and arm, so that they could hardly be noticed even by anyone within ten yards, and {{certainly}} could not be seen from up there. As I pushed it through I lighted it <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> of the old torch and then withdrew my hand like a shot. I did the same thing again an hour ago with equal success, so it is evident that they are not keeping a very sharp look-out above, and have no fear of our making a sortie, hampered as we are by our animals." ...|$|E
60|$|Sir Thomas was not {{by nature}} a {{suspicious}} man--he was too frank and open-hearted himself to think ill easily of others--but he couldn't avoid feeling certain {{that somebody had}} been tampering unjustifiably with {{the contents of his}} devonport. He counted the rows of sovereigns over once more, very carefully; then he checked the number taken out by the entry in his pocket-book; and then {{he leaned back in his}} chair with a puzzled look, took a meditative puff or two <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> of his cigar, and blew out the smoke, in a long curl that left a sort of pout upon his heavily moustached lip as soon as he had finished. Not a doubt in the world about it--somebody must have helped himself again to a dozen sovereigns.|$|E
60|$|While {{on our way}} up we came to {{an object}} which filled us with much interest. This was the stump of a tree that had evidently been cut down with an axe! So, then, we were not the first who had viewed this {{beautiful}} isle. The hand of man had been at work there before us. It now began to recur to us again that perhaps the island was inhabited, although we had not seen any traces of man until now. But a second glance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> convinced us that we had not more reason to think so now than formerly; for {{the surface of the}} wood was quite decayed and partly covered with fungus and green matter, so that it must have been cut many years ago.|$|E
50|$|In {{the event}} of the ball not being {{collected}} by a fielder in the centre, having been thrown in from the outfield, the batsmen may continue to run. Such runs are called overthrows. They usually occur when a fielder aims unsuccessfully <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> {{in an attempt to}} run out a batsman, although sometimes they are due to handling errors by the fielder receiving the ball.|$|R

6000|$|... "Then he {{was gone}} from sight, and {{we knew he was}} hidden safely in the stump, where we could not follow him, for the weasel's body is slim and slender. But I have not lived in the forest all my life without {{learning}} something, and I whispered a plan to Judge Bullfinch that met with his approval. He sent messengers at once for the ivory-billed woodpeckers, and soon four of those big birds appeared and agreed to help us. They began tearing away <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> with their strong beaks, and the splinters flew in every direction. It was not yet dark when the cunning weasel was dragged from his hole and was {{at the mercy of the}} birds he had so cruelly offended. We fell upon him in a flash, and he was dead almost instantly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, it's {{worse than}} foolish; it's downright sneaking, you know,' replied Lowten, nibbing the pen with a contemptuous face. 'He says that he's the only friend he ever had, and he's {{attached}} to him, and all that. Friendship's {{a very good}} thing in its way--we are all very friendly and comfortable <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stump,</b> for instance, over our grog, where every man pays for himself; but damn hurting yourself for anybody else, you know! No man should have more than two attachments--the first, to number one, and the second to the ladies; that's what I say--ha! ha!' Mr. Lowten concluded with a loud laugh, half in jocularity, and half in derision, which was prematurely cut short by the sound of Perker's footsteps on the stairs, at the first approach of which, he vaulted on his stool with an agility most remarkable, and wrote intensely.|$|E
6000|$|This man was {{formerly}} {{a lawyer in}} good practice; but, taking to drinking, was reduced to the lowest state. Yet not the lowest; for after the amputation of his arm, being advised by divers persons to throw himself upon the public for support, he told them that, even if he should lose his other arm, he would {{still be able to}} support himself and a servant. Certainly he is a strong-minded and iron-constitutioned man; hut, looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> of his arm, he said that the pain of the mind was a thousand times greater than the pain of the body. [...] "That hand could make the pen go fast," [...] said he. Among people in general, he {{does not seem to have}} any greater consideration in his ruin because of his former standing in society. He supports himself by making soap; and, on account of the offals used in that business, there is probably rather an evil odor in his domicile. Talking about a dead horse near his house, he said that he could not bear the scent of it. [...] "I should not think you could smell carrion in that house," [...] said a stage agent. Whereupon the soap-maker dropped his head, with a little snort, as it were, of wounded feeling; but immediately said that he took all in good part. There was an old squire of the village, a lawyer probably, whose demeanor was different,-- with a distance, yet with a kindliness; for he remembered the times when they met on equal terms. [...] "You and I," [...] said the squire, alluding to their respective troubles and sicknesses, [...] "would have died long ago, if we had not had the courage to live." [...] The poor devil kept talking to me long after everybody else had left the stoop, giving vent to much practical philosophy, and just observation on the ways of men, mingled with rather more assumption of literature and cultivation than belonged to the present condition of his mind. Meantime his great dog, a cleanly looking and not ill-bred dog, being the only decent attribute appertaining to his master,--a well-natured dog, too, and receiving civilly any demonstration of courtesy from other people, though preserving a certain distance of deportment,--this great dog grew weary of his master's lengthy talk, and expressed his impatience to be gone by thrusting himself between his legs, rolling over on his back, seizing his ragged trousers, or playfully taking his maimed, bare foot into his mouth,--using, in short, the kindly and humorous freedom of a friend, with a wretch to whom all are free enough, but none other kind. His master rebuked him, but with kindness too, and not so that the dog felt himself bound to desist, though he seemed willing to allow his master all the time that could possibly be spared. And at last, having said many times that he must go and shave and dress himself,--and as his beard had been at least a week growing, it might have seemed almost a week's work to get rid of it,--he rose from the stoop and went his way,--a forlorn and miserable thing in the light of the cheerful summer morning. Yet he seems to keep his spirits up, and still preserves himself a man among men, asking nothing from them; nor is it clearly perceptible what right they have to scorn him, though he seems to acquiesce, in a manner, in their doing so. And yet he cannot wholly have lost his self-respect; and doubtless there were persons on the stoop more grovelling than himself.|$|E
25|$|After a delay for wet field conditions, {{the third}} day began with a flurry of action, as both Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden had close calls with lbw appeals, which replays {{suggested}} should have been out, and shies <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> that just missed. However, no batsman was given {{out in the morning}} session, where only 14 overs of play was possible due to rain. Australia added 45 runs in that time.|$|R

5000|$|One {{reason for}} Amar Singh's high amount of wickets {{was that he}} bowled with an {{aggressive}} field setting and more importantly, he aimed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> while bowling. His field settings generally consisted {{of two or three}} slips, a gully, a cover point, and third man on the off side. On the leg side he usually had a short fine leg, a forward short leg, a silly mid-on and a long leg. He maintained this field against all batsmen.|$|R
50|$|Trees are felled {{and then}} delimbed and topped <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump.</b> The log is then {{transported to the}} landing, where it is bucked and loaded on a truck.

5000|$|Limbing (also {{known as}} [...] "chasing") in logging {{is the process}} of {{removing}} branches from the trunk of a fallen tree.

50|$|Cut-to-length logging (CTL) is a {{mechanized}} {{harvesting system}} in which trees are delimbed and cut to length directly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump.</b> CTL is typically a two-man, two-machine operation with a harvester felling, delimbing, and bucking trees and a forwarder transporting the logs from the felling to a landing area close to a road accessible by trucks.|$|E
