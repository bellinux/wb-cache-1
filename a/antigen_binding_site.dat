2500|$|V(D)J {{recombination}} is the rearrangement of multiple, distinct gene {{segments in}} germ-line DNA {{to produce the}} unique protein domains of immune cells, B cells and T cells, that will specifically recognize foreign antigens such as viruses, bacteria, and pathogenic eukaryotes. [...] B cells produce antibodies that are secreted into the bloodstream and T cells produce receptors that once translated are transported to the outer lipid bilayer of the cell. [...] Antibodies are composed of two light and two heavy chains. [...] The <b>antigen</b> <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> consists of two variable regions, VL and VH. [...] The remainder of the antibody structure {{is made up of}} constant regions, CL, CH, CH2 and CH3. [...] The Kappa locus in the mouse encodes an antibody light chain and contains approximately 300 gene segments for the variable region, V, four J segments than encode a short protein region, and one constant, C, segment. [...] To produce a light chain with one unique type of VL, when B cells are differentiating, DNA is rearranged to incorporate a unique combination of the V and J segments. [...] RNA splicing joins the recombined region with the C segment. [...] The heavy chain gene also contain numerous diversity segments, D, and multiple constant segments, Cμ, Cδ, Cγ, Cε, Cα. [...] Recombination occurs in a specific region of the gene that is located between two conserved sequence motifs called recombination signal sequences. [...] Each motif is flanked by a 7 bp and 9 bp sequence that is separated by a 12 bp spacer, referred to as class 1, or a 23 bp spacer, referred to as class 2. [...] A recombinase made up of RAG1 and RAG2 subunits always cleave between these two sites. [...] The cleavage results in two hairpin structures for the V and J segments, respectively, and the non-coding region, are now separated from the V and J segments by a DSB. [...] The hairpin coding region goes through the process of NHEJ where the closed end is cleaved and repaired. [...] The non-coding region is circularized and degraded. [...] Thus, NHEJ is also important {{in the development of the}} immune system via its role in V(D)J recombination.|$|E

50|$|Antibody-dependent {{enhancement}} (ADE) {{occurs when}} non-neutralising antiviral proteins facilitate virus entry into host cells, leading to increased infectivity in the cells. Some cells {{do not have}} the usual receptors on their surfaces that viruses use to gain entry. The antiviral proteins (i.e., the antibodies) bind to antibody Fc receptors that some of these cells have in the plasma membrane. The viruses bind to the <b>antigen</b> <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> {{at the other end of}} the antibody. ADE is common in cells cultured in the laboratory, but rarely occurs in vivo except for dengue virus.

50|$|Individuals with {{psoriasis}} {{may develop}} neutralizing antibodies against monoclonal antibodies. Neutralization occurs when an antidrug antibody prevents a monoclonal antibody such as infliximab from binding antigen {{in a laboratory}} test. Specifically, neutralization occurs when the antidrug antibody binds to infliximab's <b>antigen</b> <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> instead of TNF-α. When infliximab no longer binds tumor necrosis factor alpha, it no longer decreases inflammation, and psoriasis may worsen. Neutralizing antibodies have not been reported against etanercept, a biologic drug that is a fusion protein composed of two TNF-α receptors. The lack of neutralizing antibodies against etanercept is probably secondary to the innate presence of the TNF-α receptor, {{and the development of}} immune tolerance.|$|E

40|$|Antibody-based {{molecular}} recognition plays a dominant {{role in the}} life sciences ranging from applications in diagnostics and molecular imaging to targeted drug delivery and therapy. Here we report a generic approach to introduce protease sensitivity into antibody-based targeting {{by taking advantage of}} the intrinsic ability of antibodies to engage in multivalent interactions. Bivalent peptide ligands with dsDNA as a rigid linker were shown to effectively bridge the relatively large distance between the two <b>antigen</b> <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> within the same antibody, yielding exclusively the cyclic 1 : 1 antibody–ligand complex. Size exclusion chromatography and small angle X-scattering were used to study the types of complexes formed between a model antibody and peptide–dsDNA conjugates displaying 1 or 2 peptide ligands and different linker lengths. Competitive binding assays using fluorescence anisotropy revealed that the interaction between bivalent peptide–dsDNA conjugate and antibody is 500 -fold stronger than that of the monovalent peptide, allowing effective blocking of the <b>antigen</b> <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> in a non-covalent manner. Cleavage of the linker between the peptide epitope and the DNA by matrix metalloprotease 2 disables this strong bivalent interaction and was shown to effectively restore the binding activity of the antibody in an in vitro binding assay. The approach presented here is broadly applicable, because it takes advantage of the Y-shaped multivalent presentation of <b>antigen</b> <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> common to all antibodies and could be extended to control antibody activity by other input signals...|$|R
50|$|Precipitation {{occurs with}} most antigens because the antigen is {{multivalent}} (i.e. has several antigenic determinants per molecule to which antibodies can bind). Antibodies {{have at least}} two <b>antigen</b> <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> (and in the case of Immunoglobulin M there is a multimeric complex with up to 10 <b>antigen</b> <b>binding</b> <b>sites),</b> thus large aggregates or gel-like lattices of antigen and antibody are formed. Experimentally, an increasing amount of antigen is added to a constant amount of antibody in solution. Initially at low antigen concentration, all of the antibody is contained in the precipitate. This is called the antibody-excess zone (i.e. prozone phenomenon). As more antigen is added, the amount of protein precipitated increases until the antigen/antibody molecules are at an optimal ratio. This is known as the zone of equivalence or equivalence point. When the amount of antigen in solution exceeds the amount of antibody, the amount of precipitation will decrease. This is known as the antigen excess zone.|$|R
50|$|IgG {{antibodies}} {{are large}} molecules of about 150 kDa made of four peptide chains. It contains two identical class γ heavy chains of about 50 kDa and two identical light chains of about 25 kDa, thus a tetrameric quaternary structure. The two heavy chains {{are linked to}} each other and to a light chain each by disulfide bonds. The resulting tetramer has two identical halves, which together form the Y-like shape. Each end of the fork contains an identical <b>antigen</b> <b>binding</b> <b>site.</b> The various regions and domains of a typical IgG are depicted in the figure to the left. The Fc regions of IgGs bear a highly conserved N-glycosylation site. The N-glycans attached to this site are predominantly core-fucosylated diantennary structures of the complex type. In addition, small amounts of these N-glycans also bear bisecting GlcNAc and α-2,6-linked sialic acid residues.|$|E

40|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} {{suggest that the}} mechanism of T cell recognition of antigen is similar in both class I and class II MHC-restricted systems. First, the TCR molecules that recognize antigen {{in the context of}} either the class I or class II MHC molecules are assembled from the same set of germline variable region genes (V,j, and V #-Dfjfl) (1). Furthermore, several groups have demonstrated that the same V region gene can be used by different T cell clones that have MHC restriction to different classes, either class I or II (2 - 5). Second, both the class I and II MHC molecules have functional and structural similarities. Guillet et al. (6) demonstrated that class II MHC molecules have a single <b>antigen</b> <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> based on functional analysis of antigen competition. The crystal structure of a class I (HLA-A 2) molecule also suggests a single <b>antigen</b> <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> that is a cleft between two a helices located at the NH 2 terminus of the molecule (7). In addition, a model of the class II (I-A') structure proposes tertiary structural homology with the class I molecule, including a single <b>antigen</b> <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> (8).

40|$|To {{define the}} DNA binding domain of polyomavirus large T antigen, {{systematic}} deletion mutagenesis {{was carried out}} on large T antigen. A set of plasmids coding for unidirectional carboxy- or amino-terminal deletion mutations in large T antigen were constructed. Deleted proteins were expressed by plasmid transfection of Cos- 1 cells. Analysis of origin-specific DNA binding by mutant proteins revealed that the C-terminal boundary of the DNA-binding domain is at or near Glu 398. Fusion proteins of large T antigen lacking the first 200 N-terminal amino acids bound specifically to polyomavirus origin DNA; however, deletions beyond this site resulted in unstable proteins {{which could not be}} tested for DNA binding. Testing of point mutants and internal deletions by others suggest that the N-terminal boundary of the DNA-binding domain lies between amino acids 282 and 286. Taken together, these results locate the DNA-binding domain of polyomavirus large T antigen to the 116 - amino acid region between residues 282 and 398. Polyomavirus large T antigen binds to four discrete regions within the regulatory region of the viral genome. The relative arrangement of these <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> may be important for the distinct regulatory functions performed by the protein.

In the structure, four out of the six hypervariable loops of the Fab (complementarity determining regions [CDRs] L 1, H 1, H 2, and H 3) are involved in peptide association through hydrogen bonding, salt bridge formation, and hydrophobic interactions.

40|$|The Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) of {{antibodies}} {{are assumed}} {{to account for the}} antigen recognition and binding and thus to contain also the <b>antigen</b> <b>binding</b> <b>site.</b> CDRs are typically discerned by searching for regions that are most different, in sequence or in structure, between different antibodies.

Furthermore, antigen binding residues that fall outside of the structural consensus regions but within traditionally defined CDRs show a marginal energetic contribution to antigen binding.
