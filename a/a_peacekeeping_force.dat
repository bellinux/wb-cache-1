Palmyrene buildings were smashed, residents massacred and the Temple of Bel pillaged.|$|E

Together with its European {{partners}} Germany signed the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, established the Eurozone in 1999, and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007. Germany sent <b>a</b> <b>peacekeeping</b> <b>force</b> to secure stability in the Balkans and sent a force of German troops to Afghanistan as part of a NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban. These deployments were controversial since Germany is bound by domestic law only to deploy troops for defence roles.|$|E
5|$|The UN spent $1.6billion from 1994 to 1998 in {{maintaining}} <b>a</b> <b>peacekeeping</b> <b>force.</b> The Angolan military attacked UNITA {{forces in the}} Central Highlands on 4 December 1998, {{the day before the}} MPLA's fourth Congress. Dos Santos told the delegates the next day that he believed war to {{be the only way to}} ultimately achieve peace, rejected the Lusaka Protocol, and asked MONUA to leave. In February 1999, the Security Council withdrew the last MONUA personnel. In late 1998, several UNITA commanders, dissatisfied with Savimbi's leadership, formed UNITA Renovada, a breakaway militant group. Thousands more deserted UNITA in 1999 and 2000.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there have}} been {{permanent}} garrisons in Northern Ireland throughout its history, the British Army was deployed as <b>a</b> <b>peacekeeping</b> <b>force</b> from 1969 to 2007 in Operation Banner. Initially, this was (in the wake of unionist attacks on nationalist communities in Derry and Belfast) to prevent further loyalist attacks on Catholic communities; it developed into support of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and its successor, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) against the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA). Under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, there was a gradual {{reduction in the number}} of soldiers deployed. In 2005, after the PIRA declared a ceasefire, the British Army dismantled posts, withdrew many troops and restored troop levels to those of a peace-time garrison.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban {{government}} joined {{negotiations on}} 28 January 1988, {{and all three}} parties held a round of negotiations on 9 March. The South African government joined negotiations on 3 May and the parties met in June and August in New York and Geneva. All parties agreed to a ceasefire on 8 August. Representatives from the governments of Angola, Cuba, and South Africa signed the New York Accords, granting independence to Namibia and ending the direct involvement of foreign troops in the civil war, in New York City on 22 December 1988.

The force {{arrived at}} the Freeport of Monrovia on August 24, 1990, landing from Nigerian and Ghanaian vessels. By the time ECOMOG arrived, Prince Johnson's INPFL and Taylor's NPFL were fighting on the outside bounds of the port. A series of peacemaking conferences in regional capitals followed. There were meetings in Bamako in November 1990, Lome in January 1991, and Yamoussoukro in June–October 1991. The first seven peace conferences, including the Yamoussoukro I-IV processes and the Carter Center negotiation leading to the Cotonou Accords, failed {{due to lack of}} agreement between the warring factions. The NPFL launched an assault on Monrovia in 1992, which they named 'Operation Octopus.' The civil war lasted until the Abuja Accords of August 1996.|$|E

25|$|Once a {{peace treaty}} has been negotiated, the parties {{involved}} might ask the United Nations for <b>a</b> <b>peacekeeping</b> <b>force</b> to oversee various elements of the agreed upon plan.

Russia was especially opposed to allowing <b>a</b> multinational <b>peacekeeping</b> <b>force</b> from NATO to entering the Caucasus, seeing it as a move that encroached on its [...] "backyard".|$|R
