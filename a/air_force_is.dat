In 1962 the Taktik Hava Kuvveti (Tactical <b>Air</b> <b>Force)</b> <b>was</b> founded by upgrading the Hava TÃ¼meni (Air Division) units to corps-level organizations. In 1974 the <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>was</b> employed in the Cyprus War. With the arrival of 3rd generation fighter jets in 1980, the <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>was</b> reorganized.|$|R

5|$|In 2003, Sukhoi {{embarked}} on a second modernization of the Su-27 {{to serve as an}} interim aircraft awaiting the development of the Sukhoi PAK FA (Su-57) program. Also known as Su-35, this derivative has a redesigned cockpit and weapons-control system compared to the Su-27M, and features thrust-vectoring engines in place of the omitted canards. The type made its first flight in February 2008. Although the aircraft was designed for export, the Russian Air Force in 2009 became the launch customer of the aircraft, the production version of which is designated Su-35S. China's People's Liberation Army <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>is</b> the sole foreign user of the aircraft. Other countries are reportedly in discussions with Russia about the possible purchase of the Su-35, among which is Indonesia, whose government is expected to sign a contract in the near future.|$|E

5000|$|As {{part of a}} peacetime {{restructuring}} in March 1946, the United States Army <b>Air</b> <b>Forces</b> <b>were</b> reorganized {{into three}} major operating commands: the Strategic Air Command (SAC), the Tactical Air Command (TAC), and the Air Defense Command (ADC). [...] These commands reflected the basic air combat missions that evolved during the war, and each reported directly to General Carl Spaatz, the Commanding General, Army <b>Air</b> <b>Forces.</b> Numbered <b>air</b> <b>forces</b> served as an intermediate headquarters between these commands and the operational wings and groups. Eleven of the sixteen wartime <b>air</b> <b>forces</b> remained. The Eighth and Fifteenth <b>Air</b> <b>Forces</b> <b>were</b> assigned to SAC; the Third, Ninth, and Twelfth <b>Air</b> <b>Forces</b> <b>were</b> assigned to TAC; and the First, Second, Fourth, Tenth, Eleventh, and Fourteenth <b>Air</b> <b>Forces</b> <b>were</b> assigned to ADC. Second <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> would later <b>be</b> transferred to SAC in 1949. [...] The numbered <b>air</b> <b>forces</b> had both operational and administrative authority, and existed as a command level between major commands and air divisions. Although variations existed, and number <b>air</b> <b>forces</b> <b>were</b> often reassigned, this basic arrangement persisted throughout the Cold War.|$|R
50|$|When Far East <b>Air</b> <b>Forces</b> <b>was</b> disestablished in this {{consolidation}} of command, General Kuter became {{commander in chief}} of the newly created Pacific <b>Air</b> <b>Forces</b> on July 1, 1957.

50|$|On May 2, 1962 the Directorate of Military Operations in India had {{suggested}} that the <b>air</b> <b>force</b> should <b>be</b> readied for use in NEFA and Ladakh. The <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>was</b> considered a feasible way to repel the unbalanced ratio of Chinese troops to Indian troops and the Chinese <b>air</b> <b>force</b> <b>was</b> assessed as only capable of limited strategic raids which could be countered by the Indian <b>air</b> <b>force.</b> Indian <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> soon started reconnaissance flights over the NEFA border. On May 7, 1962 Chinese troops shot down an Indian Dakota plane in which young officer B. P. Tiwari was lost.
