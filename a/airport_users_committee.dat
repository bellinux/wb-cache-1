40|$|Abstract: In this research, {{we used a}} multinomial logit (MNL) {{discrete}} choice analysis {{technique to}} deepen {{the understanding of the}} mode choice behavior of various <b>airport</b> <b>user</b> groups categorized by trip purpose and trip distance for ground airport access. We used revealed preference (RP) data collected by an on-site-survey administrated by the Korea Transport Institute (KOTI) at the Kimpo International Airport passenger terminal in South Korea. Initially, four basic models were selected from a variety of model specifications, and these were analyzed to address general preferences in mode choice. The models were then evaluated in terms of the resulting estimation. The best-fitting model specification among four models was chosen for further study. Both trip distance models (standard-distance (SD) and long-distance (LD)) and trip purpose models (departing (D) and non-departing (ND)) were estimated. The results analyzed in this study encompass an unambiguous spectrum of mode choice behaviors associated with distinct <b>airport</b> <b>user</b> groups. The fundamental information, either revealed or reflected by modeling ground airport access for various <b>airport</b> <b>user</b> groups, could be essential not only to transportation planners-especially at the first phase of airport planning- but also to airport authorities faced with difficulties in managing ground transportation facilities to effectively serve <b>airport</b> <b>users...</b>|$|R

The objectives of this research were to identify Sandakan Airport users' landscape preferences and develop into a design proposal for the landscape design and safety issues at the car park and lay by area in Sandakan Airport; and to improve the first impression, sense of place and welcome to <b>airport</b> <b>users.</b> Survey, site analysis and landscape planning were carried out to upgrade the car park and lay by area in Sandakan Airport. Survey questionnaires were used to understand the preferences of Sandakan <b>Airport</b> <b>users</b> on the hardscape element, design element, theme preference and knowledge on landscape, supplementary data such as site inventory analysis were also collected. Site inventory and analysis were also done {{to aid in the}} synthesis of sustainable landscape design such as selection of plants that suits the intrinsic characteristics of certain area such as planting of shade tolerant plants at shady area and drought tolerant plants at dry soil area. The landscape design proposed had incorporate sustainable elements to lower the maintenance of the design, improvements on standards of safety for <b>airport</b> <b>users</b> and aesthetic elements to improve the appearance and quality of Sandakan Airport.

40|$|Water is a {{critical}} natural resource not only to life and natural ecosystem functioning, but also, for economic and social development. The global recognition {{of the role of}} water in development dates back in 1977 with the United Nations Water Conference in Mar del Plata. Since then, water has remained pivotal in the development of nations. Specifically, groundwater is critical to sustainable development, meeting the global water needs of over 1. 5 million people daily. However, it is rarely well managed. This study therefore examined community water management, and analysed the participation of water <b>user</b> <b>committees</b> in public groundwater infrastructure management in relation to functional sustainability in Namayingo Town Council. Community water management was adopted to involve communities in groundwater development and management, and enhance the sustainability of rural water systems in Uganda. Yet, non-functionality of water sources upsurges, and the Ministry of Water and Environment continues to offer technical solutions. However, it is important to analyse the social and community factors, maintenance, and water sector policy and institutional frameworks that impact on the participation of water <b>user</b> <b>committees</b> and functional sustainability. For empirical evidence, empirical investigation was based on a case study design taking a qualitative approach. Findings revealed that community water management remains rhetoric in Namayingo Town Council. In policy documents, the model promises sustainability. However, non-functionality of water facilities reveals the inability of the model to address sustainability. There was lack of participation of water <b>user</b> <b>committees</b> in the initial stages of groundwater infrastructure development. Further, the practice of the national water sector policies at community level exacerbated by inadequate institutional support did not support the institutional and economic structures of water <b>user</b> <b>committees.</b> Hence, participation and inadequate social capital were key in understanding the lack of functionality sustainability of groundwater facilities in Namayingo Town Council, Ugand...|$|R
