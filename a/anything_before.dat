5|$|Mark Hoppus' {{involvement}} {{stems from}} when an Atticus Clothing employee played him I Am the Movie. He was so taken with {{it that he}} raved about the band in Rolling Stone, inviting them to open for his group, Blink-182 on their 2004 European tour. On the trek, he became good friends with the musicians. He told them that he had purchased an abundance of recording gear and amplifiers for the previous Blink-182 album and told the band of his interest in recording music from a production standpoint. At the final show of the tour, guitarist Joshua Cain went to Hoppus' dressing room {{and asked him to}} produce their next record. Although Hoppus had never produced <b>anything</b> <b>before,</b> he was excited {{to be a part of}} the album and accepted the offer.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{tensions}} between Osden and the rest, he is sent alone to do a species survey in the forest. While he is still out alone, Porlock, one of the scientists on the team, is scared by what he believes {{to be a large}} ape in the forest. The other team members investigate for a couple of days, without finding <b>anything,</b> <b>before</b> Osden fails to contact them at a pre-assigned time. Tomiko leads three others to his camp in the forest, where they find him knocked out, apparently by an unknown assailant. They bring him back to camp, where he gradually recovers, and tells the group that he had felt a strong fear response from the forest itself. Tomiko realizes that the assailant must {{have been one of the}} other team members. While Osden is asleep, the fear emanations from the forest drive Porlock to verbally lash out at Osden, and admit to trying to kill him in the forest. Porlock attempts to assault Osden again, but the others restrain him and place him under a sedative.|$|E

25|$|From the 22nd on, {{the seven}} leaders managed to {{convince}} 18 other officers {{to join the}} uprising {{with varying degrees of}} enthusiasm. Non-commissioned officers (NCOs) were informed {{on the night of the}} 25th, hours before the attacks started. Although the officers insisted that all NCOs participated voluntarily and any orders given were merely pro forma, many of the NCOs argued later that they had been in no real position to refuse to participate. The soldiers themselves, 70% of whom were less than a month out of basic training, were not told <b>anything</b> <b>before</b> the coup began, though many were (according to the officers) enthusiastic once the uprising began.|$|E
25|$|With stylometric {{approaches}} it {{is possible}} to identify certain characteristics which are very typical of Shakespeare, {{such as the use of}} particular poetic techniques or the frequency with which various common words are used, and these have been used to argue that Marlowe could not have written Shakespeare's works. In every case so far where these data have been plotted over time, however, Marlowe's corpus has been found to fit just where Shakespeare's would have been, had he written <b>anything</b> <b>before</b> the early 1590s as all of Marlowe's were. On the other hand, whereas stylometry might be useful in discerning where two sets of work are not by the same person, it can be used with less confidence to show that they are. This was something that T.C. Mendenhall, whose work some Marlovians have nevertheless thought proves their theory, was at pains to point out.|$|E
25|$|On 16 January 1808, Linnet {{was some}} {{six or seven}} leagues from Cape Barfleur when she saw a French lugger {{pursuing}} two English vessels, a ship and a brig. Linnet joined up with the English vessels and towards night was able to close with the lugger. After an engagement of {{a little over two}} hours, the French lugger was in a sinking state and so struck. She was the privateer Courier, of 18 guns. She had a complement of 60 men under the command of Captain Alexander Black, and had lost her second captain killed and three men wounded. (Linnet had no loses.) Courier had been out four days and had been sheltering from a gale at the Îles Saint-Marcouf. She had not captured <b>anything</b> <b>before</b> herself being captured. However, earlier that day Courier apparently unsuccessfully engaged for two hours the merchant vessel Tagus, Connolly, master, which had been sailing from Monte Video and Cork.|$|E

500|$|Jean became show runner of The Simpsons at {{the start}} of the third season (1991) {{together}} with Reiss. A show runner has the ultimate responsibility of all the processes that an episode goes through before completion, including the writing, the animation, the voice acting, and the music. When Jean began his tenure as show runner, the only thing he thought to himself every day was [...] "Don't blow it and screw up this thing everyone loves." [...] The first episode Jean and Reiss ran was [...] "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" [...] (aired September 19, 1991), and they felt a lot of pressure on them to make it good. They were so pressured that they did six to seven rewrites of the script in order to improve its humor. Jean said he [...] "kept thinking 'It's not good enough. It's not good enough.'" [...] Reiss added that [...] "we were definitely scared. We had never run <b>anything</b> <b>before,</b> and they dumped us on this." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer. It is one of The Simpsons creator Matt Groening's {{favorite}} episodes of the earlier seasons {{because he thought it}} took the show to another level. Meyer said he has a [...] "deep suspicion of social institutions and tradition in general," [...] which affected the way he wrote the episode. Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had written for The Simpsons {{since the start of the}} show, took over as show runners for the third season. Their first episode as show runners was [...] "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" [...] and they felt a lot of pressure about running the show. Jean and Reiss were so pressured that they did six to seven rewrites of the script to make it funnier. Jean said [...] "one reason for doing all these rewrites is because I kept thinking 'It's not good enough. It's not good enough'," [...] and Reiss added that [...] "we were definitely scared. We had never run <b>anything</b> <b>before,</b> and they dumped us on this." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{writer for}} The Boston Globe called the song a [...] "lone glimmer in the gloom" [...] with [...] "incongruously downtrodden groove", adding that fans of Evanescence {{would like the}} song. Blabbermouth.nets Don Kaye found the song to be a [...] "melancholy ballad". Richard Harrington of The Washington Post found some quiet moments on The Open Door most notably on the [...] "haunting ballad 'Good Enough'" [...] and on [...] "Like You". Writing for the {{magazine}} St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Sara Berry concluded that the band balanced the [...] "scorching rock anthems" [...] with [...] "reflective, piano-heavy ballads" [...] like [...] "Lithium" [...] and [...] "Good Enough". She further found an [...] "intimate-sounding setting" [...] which featured just Lee and her piano. The Providence Journals Rick Massimo, wrote that the song is [...] "being rather melodramatic but melodically successful". Chris Harris of Rolling Stone wrote that Lee is [...] "stroking the ivories and delivering her lyrics with an elegant sweetness" [...] which he found reminiscent of Tori Amos and Sarah McLachlan. A writer for Reuters called the song [...] "as intense and affecting as <b>anything</b> <b>before</b> it -- and this time, Amy Lee's lyric steps from the dark side, reveling in the relief of positivity." ...|$|E

500|$|Reception for {{the song}} was mostly positive. Jack Breschard of Rolling Stone called it one of Joel's [...] "best efforts". Ira Mayer called it Joel's [...] "signature piece," [...] and Stephen Holden said the song, a [...] "centerpiece" [...] of the album, [...] "compelled {{attention}} for [...] despairing portraits of urban fringe life, despite [...] underlying shallowness." [...] Holden also believed that the song had a Bob Dylan feel to it. [...] "As with so many rock stars, {{one of his most}} important early influences was Bob Dylan–in fact, 'Piano Man' and 'Captain Jack,' two of his more ambitious early tunes, as well as the more recent and better 'She's Always a Woman,' are practically keyboard parodies of Dylan critiques," [...] Holden says. Author Hank Bordowitz called [...] "Captain Jack" [...] "as bleak a portrait of growing up in the affluent suburbs as <b>anything</b> <b>before</b> L.A. punk hit nearly a decade later". Stuart Levine of Variety called the song [...] "lyrically expansive" [...] and [...] "dark." [...] Ron Rosenbaum of Slate, in a very negative review of Joel's work, criticized [...] "Captain Jack," [...] summarizing the song as, [...] "Loser dresses up in poseur clothes and masturbates and shoots up heroin and is an all-around phony {{in the eyes of the}} songwriter who is so, so superior to him." ...|$|E

The story had the Vision's memory and human brain patterns wiped out, severed {{his relationship with his}} wife, revealed their children to be essentially imaginary constructs, and included a two-page spread showing a dismantled Vision. Journalist Karen Walker later commented, [...] "This image alone has probably done more to shape how future writers (and readers) perceive the character than <b>anything</b> <b>before</b> or since. Once seen broken down into component parts, it’s hard to truly move past that image and think of the Vision as a synthetic man, not a machine." ...|$|E

[...] Black Sabbath bandmate Tony Iommi said that, while all the band were involved with {{alcohol and other}} drugs to various degrees in the 1970s, Osbourne had the unhealthiest lifestyle of them all.
