5|$|Following the report, the CLR {{purchased}} 64 {{driving motor}} carriages {{for use with}} the existing stock; together, these were formed into six- or seven-carriage trains. The change to multiple unit operation was completed by June 1903 and <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the locomotives were scrapped. Those two were retained for shunting use in the depot.|$|E
5|$|Raonic prefers {{playing on}} hard courts, {{where he has}} been more {{successful}} than on clay or grass courts. <b>All</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the tournaments where Raonic has reached the final have been played on hard courts, and all but three of his victories over top10 players have been on hard courts as well.|$|E

5|$|<b>All</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the Hydrobatidae {{are mostly}} dark in colour with varying amounts of {{white on the}} rump. Two species have {{different}} plumage entirely, the Hornby's storm petrel which has white undersides and facial markings, and the fork-tailed storm petrel which has pale grey plumage. This is a notoriously difficult group to identify at sea. Onley and Scofield (2007) state that much published information is incorrect, and that photographs in the major seabird books and websites are frequently incorrectly ascribed as to species. They also consider that several national bird lists include species which have been incorrectly identified or have been accepted on inadequate evidence.|$|E
5|$|<b>All</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the {{handcart}} companies {{successfully completed}} the rugged journey, with relatively few problems {{and only a}} few deaths. However, the fourth and fifth companies, known as the Willie and Martin Companies, respectively, had serious problems. The companies left Iowa City, Iowa, in July 1856, very late to begin the trip across the plains. They met severe winter weather west of present-day Casper, Wyoming, and continued to cope with deep snow and storms {{for the remainder of the}} journey. Food supplies were soon exhausted. Young organized a rescue effort that brought the companies in, but more than 210 of the 980 emigrants in the two parties died.|$|E
5|$|Although Bo was {{initially}} unhappy about his reassignment in Chongqing, he soon resolved {{to use his}} new position as a staging ground {{for a return to}} higher national office. Bo made no secret of his desire to enter the nine-member Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) during the 18th Party Congress in autumn 2012, as <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the PSC members—including President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao—were expected to retire. The transition would be an opportunity for Bo to join the highest echelon of national leadership, likely as a replacement for ally Zhou Yongkang, secretary of the Central Political and Legislative Committee, serving {{as the head of the}} party's security apparatus.|$|E

5|$|Both clubs {{played a}} total of eight games in four stages {{to advance to the}} final. Chelsea had the upper hand in all but one of their encounters, {{defeating}} Tromsø with an accumulative score of 9–4 in a two-legged match and edging Vicenza by one goal. Stuttgart also enjoyed an advantage in <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> their meetings, beating ÍBV 5–2 on aggregate and winning over Slavia Prague and Lokomotiv Moscow by two goals.|$|E
5|$|Demolition {{began in}} August 1967. The {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} Nordman Construction after an unsuccessful tender process. The company brought in the Magnus II, a floating crane with a lifting capacity of 400tons, which could remove <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the spans. These longer spans were pulled sideways off the piers, expecting that they would break into manageable pieces under their own weight. They proved stronger than this and remained intact, needing to be broken up in the river, with much sinking into the bed instead of being recovered.|$|E
5|$|During Ruisdael's last period {{he began}} to depict {{mountain}} scenes, such as Mountainous and Wooded Landscape with a River, dateable to the late 1670s. This portrays a rugged range with the highest peak in the clouds. Ruisdael's subjects became unusually varied. The art historian Wolfgang Stechow identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre, and Ruisdael's work encompasses <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> them, excelling at most: forests, rivers, dunes and country roads, panoramas, imaginary landscapes, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Only the Italianate and foreign landscapes other than Scandinavian are absent from his oeuvre.|$|E
5000|$|Philip [...] "Rusty" [...] Rastelli (January 31, 1918 - June 24, 1991) was a New York mobster {{and former}} {{boss of the}} Bonanno crime family, though he spent <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> years <b>of</b> his reign in prison.|$|R

5|$|In 1120, the English {{political}} landscape changed dramatically. Three hundred passengers embarked on the White Ship {{to travel from}} Barfleur in Normandy to England, including {{the heir to the}} throne, William Adelin, and many other senior nobles. Stephen had intended to sail on the same ship but changed his mind at the last moment and got off to await another vessel, either out of concern for overcrowding on board the ship, or because he was suffering from diarrhoea. The ship foundered en route, and <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the passengers died, including William Adelin.|$|E
5|$|In 1120, the English {{political}} landscape had changed dramatically after the White Ship disaster. Around three hundred passengers – including Matilda's brother William Adelin {{and many other}} senior nobles – embarked one night on the White Ship to travel from Barfleur in Normandy across to England. The vessel foundered just outside the harbour, possibly {{as a result of}} overcrowding or excessive drinking by the ship's master and crew, and <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the passengers died. William Adelin was among the casualties.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette College {{encompasses}} a lively Greek community. Though {{students are not}} eligible to join these organizations until sophomore year, approximately 40.20% of eligible students join the school's fraternities and sororities. <b>All</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the Greek organizations at Lafayette are located on campus, making it a viable living option. Additionally, members of each house commit themselves to various philanthropic ventures throughout the academic year as these groups work together with the college, local, and national affiliates to help achieve the goals and ideals their organizations were founded upon.|$|E

5|$|Mumbai police {{department}} originally identified 37 suspects—including two army officers—for their alleged {{involvement in the}} plot. <b>All</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the suspects, {{many of whom are}} identified only through aliases, are Pakistani. Two more suspects arrested in the United States in October 2009 for other attacks were also found to have been involved in planning the Mumbai attacks. One of these men, Pakistani American David Headley (born Daood Sayed Gilani), was found to have made several trips to India before the attacks and gathered video and GPS information on behalf of the plotters.|$|E
5|$|The Phantoms {{began to}} be {{returned}} to the USAF in 1972. No.6 Squadron ceased operating the aircraft on 4October 1972. Six F-4Es departed for the United States on 25October that year, followed by a further five in early November. The first six F-111s arrived at Amberley on 1June 1973, and six Phantoms left for the United States five days later. The final RAAF Phantom flight was made on 20June, and four of the aircraft departed the next day. The last two Phantoms left Amberley on 21June. <b>All</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the former RAAF Phantoms were subsequently converted to specialist Wild Weasel aircraft.|$|E
5|$|When the Western Suburbs formed their club, most {{of their}} players had come from Ashfield Rugby Union Club, which was a second {{division}} team to the Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club. <b>All</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the first grade team of Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club rejected offers from Western Suburbs. However, when Cumberland were looking for players, 23 of the 27 players present at the meeting signed with the club, {{most of which were}} rugby union players from the Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club.|$|E

30|$|In {{this current}} series, removal of NSLNs added no {{additional}} histological information in <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> cases (<b>of</b> {{which one was}} a recognised failed SLNB). Removing more NSLNs may suggest a less directed SLNB has been performed, which could potentially {{increase the risk of}} morbidity, through additional axillary dissection.|$|R
5|$|With <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the {{remaining}} EU members obliged to join, together with future {{members of the}} EU, the enlargement of the eurozone is set to continue. Outside the EU, the euro is also the sole currency of Montenegro and Kosovo and several European microstates (Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican City) {{as well as in}} four overseas territories of EU members that are not themselves part of the EU (Saint Barthélemy, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, the French Southern and Antarctic Lands and Akrotiri and Dhekelia). Together this direct usage of the euro outside the EU affects nearly 3million people.|$|E
5|$|<b>All</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> {{the fifteen}} {{multiplayer}} maps {{are based on}} locations explored throughout the God of War series, with eight of those based on locations explored in Ascension; for example, Desert of Lost Souls is from the original God of War, Bog of the Forgotten is from God of War II, and Labyrinth of Daedalus, Forum of Hercules, and Chamber of the Flame are from God of War III. The two original maps are the Coliseum of Persia and the Walls of Troy (which features the Trojan Horse). Every map features special power-ups awarded by the gods for earning points, such as the Boots of Hermes for acceleration and running attacks. Maps also have environmental obstacles or objectives to complete for more points. For example, on the Desert of Lost Souls map, the cyclops Polyphemus may attack nearby players and killing him with the Spear of Olympus will grant bonus points for that team.|$|E
5|$|Bowman Creek's main stem is {{designated}} as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and the watersheds of <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> its tributaries have the same designation. The watersheds of the remaining two tributaries, Sorber Run and Cider Run, are {{designated as}} Exceptional Value waters, with standards even {{higher than those of}} High-Quality Coldwater Fisheries. Additionally, these two tributaries are the only Wilderness Trout Streams in Wyoming County. Wild trout naturally reproduce throughout all of the creek's tributaries. A total of ten named streams in the watershed of Bowman Creek are classified by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission as Class A Wild Trout Waters. Most hold this designation for brook trout only, but Sugar Hollow Creek and a section of Roaring Run hold the designation for rainbow trout, either instead of or in addition to brook trout.|$|E
