5|$|Acquired {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (AIDS) {{is defined}} in terms of either a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells per µL or the occurrence of specific diseases in association with an HIV infection. In the absence of specific treatment, around half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS within ten years. The most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of <b>AIDS</b> <b>are</b> pneumocystis pneumonia (40%), cachexia in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%), and esophageal candidiasis. Other common signs include recurring respiratory tract infections.|$|E

50|$|One {{challenge}} {{for assessing the}} effectiveness of <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> that not all <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> intended to generate economic growth. Some <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> intended for humanitarian purposes; some may simply improve {{the standard of living}} of people in developing countries.|$|R

By the late 20th century, the digital hearing <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> distributed to the public commercially. Some of the first hearing <b>aids</b> <b>were</b> external hearing <b>aids.</b> External hearing aids directed sounds in front of the ear and blocked all other noises.

5|$|Low-tech {{communication}} <b>aids</b> <b>are</b> {{defined as}} {{those that do not}} need batteries, electricity or electronics. These are often very simple communication boards or books, from which the user selects letters, words, phrases, pictures, and/or symbols to communicate a message. Depending on physical abilities and limitations, users may indicate the appropriate message with a body part, light pointer, eye-gaze direction, or a head/mouth stick. Alternatively, they may indicate yes or no while a listener scans through possible options.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms are the causative agents (pathogens) in many {{infectious}} diseases. The organisms involved include pathogenic bacteria, causing {{diseases such}} as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax; protozoa, causing {{diseases such as}} malaria, sleeping sickness, dysentery and toxoplasmosis; and also fungi causing diseases such as ringworm, candidiasis or histoplasmosis. However, other diseases such as influenza, yellow fever or <b>AIDS</b> <b>are</b> caused by pathogenic viruses, which are not usually classified as living organisms and are not, therefore, microorganisms by the strict definition. No clear examples of archaean pathogens are known, although a relationship has been proposed between the presence of some archaean methanogens and human periodontal disease.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the vast}} scope of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, many Malawian men believe that HIV {{contraction}} and death from <b>AIDS</b> <b>are</b> inevitable. Older men in particular often claim that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is a punishment issued by God or other supernatural forces. Other men refer to their own irresponsible sexual behaviors when explaining why they believe that death from AIDS is inevitable. These men sometimes claim that unprotected sex is natural (and therefore necessary and good) when justifying their lack of condom use during sex with extramarital partners. Finally, some men identify as HIV-positive without having undergone testing for HIV, preferring {{to believe that they}} have already been infected so they can avoid adopting undesirable preventative measures such as condom use or strict fidelity. Because of these fatalistic beliefs, many men continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations despite the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Malawi.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the issues of}} foreign aid and its policies. The supposed justifications of foreign <b>aid</b> <b>are</b> introduced and examined. The morality and constitutionality of the many motives for foreign <b>aid</b> <b>are</b> weighed against reason, feeling, the Constitution and the Bible. Through thorough examination of foreign <b>aid,</b> it <b>is</b> shown that foreign <b>aid</b> funds <b>are</b> often dispensed nonchalantly and without proper motive {{on the part of}} the U.

5|$|Airports {{generally}} have long, fully lit, hard-surfaced runways, full air traffic control, and navigation and landing aids. They are usually located on urban fringes, support commercial and business operations, and often exclude {{certain types of}} light aircraft. At the more rurally located airfields, the lighter end of aviation, such as microlight and gliding activities, becomes increasingly prevalent, and there are few or no commercial operations other than flying schools. At this level runways are generally shorter, and grass surfaces are increasingly common. Navigation <b>aids</b> <b>are</b> increasingly scarce, being more basic where they are available, and informal ground to air radio communication replaces air traffic control. The smallest airfields {{are too small to}} feature on general purpose Ordnance Survey (OS) maps, and lack basic facilities such as fuel and maintenance. The majority of airstrips are basically single short grass runways with no supporting facilities, although the presence of a hangar is not uncommon at the larger examples. They do not feature on OS maps, and are owned by private clubs or, more commonly, individuals.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the fungibility {{of foreign aid}} and makes three contributions to the existing literature. Firstly, fungibility of aid at the aggregate level is reexamined on a richer panel dataset of 91 developing countries for 1980 - 2009, taking into account endogeneity of aid and autocorrelation in residuals. Results indicate that <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> strongly fungible: around 80 % is substituting rather than increasing government spending in the short run. There is also substantial heterogeneity in the sample, with aid being more fungible for countries with a low share of aid in GDP. Secondly, <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> disaggregated into bilateral and multilateral components. Despite substantial differences between both components, there are only very small indications that multilateral <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> less fungible than bilateral <b>aid</b> and estimates <b>are</b> volatile when <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> instrumented. Thirdly, this study attempts to distinguish between off- and on-budget aid at the aggregate level using the value of technical cooperation {{as a proxy for}} off-budget aid. While on-budget <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> strongly fungible, off-budget <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> non-fungible. In the long run, around 50 % of aid increases government expenditures, although results are not stable. High levels of fungibility (except for off-budget aid) suggest that resources spent on earmarking may be wasted and donors should rethink the way <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> distributed...|$|R
30|$|Altruistic <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> the {{one that}} seeks to enhance {{economic}} development. According to Lumsdaine (1993 : 38), this kind of <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> the sort of assistance offered with the pure objective of {{improving the quality of}} life. Altruistic <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> usually offered on soft-terms and in long-term basis. Morgenthau (1962 : 304) refers to it as ‘aid for economic development’ and Hook (1995) labels it under ‘aid welfare’. The difference between humanitarian and altruistic <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> that the former is provided in emergency situations and its interventions are punctual, while the latter seeks sustained development with long-term interventions.|$|R

40|$|<b>Aid</b> <b>is</b> {{said to be}} fungible at the {{aggregate}} level if it raises government expenditures by less than the total amount. This happens when the recipient government decreases domestic revenue, decreases net borrowing, or when aid bypasses the budget. This study makes three contributions to both fungibility and fiscal response literature. First, fungibility at {{the aggregate}} level is re-examined on a bigger recent panel dataset, distinguishing between short- and longterm impact of aid. The results indicate that <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> partly fungible {{in the long run}} and highly fungible in the short run. Second, to account for aid bypassing the budget, technical cooperation is used as a proxy for off-budget <b>aid.</b> Off-budget <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> found to be non-fungible and on-budget <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> partly fungible. Third, fungibility of bilateral and multilateral <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> analysed: the results indicate lower fungibility of multilateral aid...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{assessing}} the effects of aid on fiscal behaviour in Indonesia. There are four main findings.

Second, although project <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> by definition intended for development expenditures, it results in an increase in routine expenditure as well.

40|$|Previous {{studies in}} the {{development}} aid literature have concluded that bilateral <b>aid</b> flows have <b>been</b> dominated by strategic objectives of major donors. Similar analysis of multilateral aid flows has determined that these allocations are more sensitive to economic need and quality of institutions and policy of the recipient country. A consensus has emerged that all bilateral <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> strategically driven while multilateral <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> independent of these political pressures. This paper challenges these conventional notions of the different aid types by analyzing allocation decisions from U. S. bilateral and multilateral aid agencies. It finds that strategic considerations influence both bilateral and multilateral aid. Donor influence over multilateral aid allocations requires a rethinking of how strategic <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> pursued. Improvements to the models of <b>aid</b> flows <b>are</b> offered, and a preliminary empirical analysis is attempted.
