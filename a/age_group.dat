The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of relative age in male and female marathon running. Marathon finishing times for the top ten male (aged 20 - 69 years) and female athletes (aged 20 - 64 years) were obtained from the 2013 New York and Chicago marathons. Intra-class and inter-class validity were evaluated by comparing performances within (intra-class) and between (inter-class) the 5 -year <b>age</b> <b>groups.</b> Results showed intra-class effects in all male <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> over 50 years, in all female <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> over 40 years, and in male and female 20 - 24 <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> (p < 0. 05).

This study provided the first evaluation of the effects of relative age in male and female marathon running. The results provide preliminary but compelling evidence that the relatively older male athletes in <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> over 50 years and the relatively older females in <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> over 40 years are competitively disadvantaged compared to the younger athletes in these <b>age</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R
5|$|Historically Bournemouth has {{suffered}} from negative rates of natural increase and has relied on immigration to maintain population growth. In 2007 however, births exceeded deaths for the first time, and this trend has continued through to 2011.

Such problems have sometimes been the focus of criticism in the context of broader psychosocial interpretation. For example, feminist author Barbara Brickman has speculated that reported gender differences in rates of self-harm are due to deliberate socially biased methodological and sampling errors, directly blaming medical discourse for pathologising the female.|$|E
