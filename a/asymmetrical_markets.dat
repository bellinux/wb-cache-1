40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{application}} of leniency programs. An analysis of the structure and design of leniency programs and existing literature raises a new question: Are leniency programs effective, {{in the sense that}} they deter cartels from formation, in <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>markets?</b> A game theoretical model, which allows for asymmetry and predatory pricing, is used to provide an answer. A leniency program does not always lead to a breach of trust. We find that, in certain industries, leniency programs are unable to break collusion. They may have the adverse effect {{in the sense that they}} strengthen cartel stability or may even lead to abuse of market power. A relatively large firm can use coercion to remove the option to a smaller firm to self-report to the authorities, thus removing the risk of prosecution posed by the program. In industries characterized by a certain degree of asymmetry in market shares and high sunk costs this is an even more likely scenario. In view of this limitation, a number of policy implications are provided in the paper. Policies aimed at the removal of the threat of retaliation need to be considered in order to convict and deter these kinds of cartels. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the day-of-the-week {{effects in the}} Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea stock markets. Various significant day-of-the-week effects, including the typical negative Monday and positive Friday effects are detected in the stock markets Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong. Further analysis shows that only Friday effect in Taiwan is sustainable while all other effects disappeared completely after accounting for equity risks. Besides, this study also finds evidences of risk and return tradeoff as well as <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>market</b> effects. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few years, several {{articles}} have been devoted {{to the study of}} electric commerce on the open network, electric payment models and sketching their emerging developments. A great deal of effort has been made on security technologies and stability of financial systems. What seems to be lacking, however, is research of the market structure of electronic payment services and consideration of their competition and public interest. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the market characteristic of electronic payment services and to investigate suitable regulation policies for competition. It is concluded that electronic payment services have the characteristics of network industries and the <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>market</b> which consists of a precedence monopoly firm and new entry firms as "bypass" will occur. Therefore, regulation theories relevant to network industries and public utilities are considered to be effective...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the calendar anomalies in the Malaysian stock market. Using various generalized {{autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity}} models; this study reveals the different anomaly patterns in this market for before, {{during and after the}} Asian financial crisis periods. Among other important findings, the evidence of negative Monday returns in post-crisis period is consistent with the related literature. However, this study finds no evidence of a January effect or any other monthly seasonality. The current empirical findings on the mean returns and their volatility in the Malaysian stock market could be useful in designing trading strategies and drawing investment decisions. For instance, as {{there appears to be no}} month-of-the-year effect, long-term investors may adopt the buy-and-hold strategy in the Malaysia stock market to obtain normal returns. In contrast, to obtain abnormal profit, investors have to deliberately looking for short-run misaligned price due to varying market volatility based on the finding of day-of-the-week effect. Besides, investors can use the day-of-the-week effect information to avoid and reduce the risk when investing in the Malaysian stock market. Further analysis using EGARCH and TGARCH models uncovered that <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>market</b> reactions on th...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} demands on many multilingual scholars outside the centre(s) {{of scientific knowledge}} production to publish their research in international scholarly journals, the support for such academic writing for publication is uneven at best. Existing English for research publication purposes (ERPP) instruction typically aims to aid multilingual scholars in achieving genre-based expectations and/or navigating the submission and review process, but it often {{does not address the}} politics of English-language knowledge production. In this paper, informed by an empirical case study and a theory building perspective, we address the need for a sustained program of courses/workshops for multilingual scholars in the (semi-) periphery and propose a means of operationalizing a critical-pragmatic approach to such course/workshop content. Our empirically-driven model is informed by the results of a recent case study investigation into an intensive ERPP intervention designed to address multilingual Spanish-speaking L 1 scholars’ challenges with writing research articles for publication in indexed (Web of Science) international scientific journals. Our model lays the groundwork for a more critical approach to ERPP pedagogy, one that attempts to attend more fully to the needs of multilingual scholars within an <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>market</b> of global knowledge production...|$|R
40|$|We thank James Peck and {{participants}} in an Ohio State University seminar for helpful comments. Loyalty discounts are nonlinear tariffs that condition rebates or marginal prices on meeting aggregate purchase or market share targets. These discounts are widespread, {{and are often}} the impetus for consumers to form buying groups, or group purchase organizations (GPOs). This paper models the competitive effects of {{the introduction of a}} GPO to a market for which the GPO’s member preferences are horizontally differentiated. We show that although in a monopoly setting, nonlinear tariffs are an effective way to extract consumer surplus, when suppliers compete using such schedules, the results are far more competitive than simple Bertrand-Nash competition with linear tariffs. In our model, the nonlinear schedule puts all customers “in play ” to a degree that contrasts sharply with the competition at the margin characteristic of constant perunit prices. We demonstrate that asymmetry in preferences does not disturb the efficiency or the price advantage for consumers of our results, but that with <b>asymmetrical</b> preferences, <b>market</b> shares for the preferred supplier are higher than under constant per-unit prices. Finally, we examine the effects of bundling discount schedules across product categories when oligopolists compete with nonlinear tariffs...|$|R
40|$|The Public Value {{concept is}} a Public Management {{normative}} process that utilizes efficiency and ethics as co-equal determinants to assess organizational outcomes. As such, Public Value represents what Ghoshal calls intellectual pluralism or {{the utilization of}} normative management processes {{in the social sciences}} to challenge the intellectual absolutism of the Chicago School. One discipline where Public Value can be used to assess normative results is Legal Studies’ antitrust field. This research applies Public Value criteria in evaluating the U. S. Supreme Court’s 2013 ruling in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics. The conclusions tentatively found the Court’s decision will (a) create Public Value at the macro level but (b) trigger public failure at the micro level for poor women because of an asymmetrical information network. This outcome fits with Stiglitz’s hypothesis concerning <b>asymmetrical</b> information and <b>market</b> failure. Further empirical research on Myriad’s policy is recommended...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} selected small national securities {{markets in}} western and central Europe {{under the influence}} of change in the structure of world financial market practice and increased information flows. Markets studied in detail and visited on one or more occasions are those of Denmark, Austria, Portugal, Hungary, The Netherlands, Belgium and two German regional exchanges, Hamburg and Bremen. Data on the German market as a whole is studied for its relevance to neighbouring small national exchanges. The formation of new markets in the Czech Republic and Slovakia is observed based on information about, and visits to, Prague and Bratislava. Market institutions, mechanisms and participants, particularly banks and brokers, are examined for their contribution to the viability and validity of each market and the realisation of development potential. The literature of price discovery, returns generation, <b>asymmetrical</b> information, <b>market</b> microstructure and investor behaviour is reviewed, as is the history of national exchanges for determinants of their present-day form and behaviour. Structured, questionnaire-based interviews with market participants, other fieldwork information and the considerable volume of contemporary press and periodical material relating to market reforms constitute the main body of evidence. Market-by-market analysis is conducted to support conclusions based on initial hypotheses about the function and purpose of small national markets and formal models of investor, borrower and broker behaviour. Trading volume is separately analysed over the longest practicable period, using time-series econometric methods for evidence of ability to reveal information about market behaviour and reliability as an income generator to sustain market-dependent broking populations and market institutions. Institutional factors are found to determine the volume of trading in the medium term and hence, via the level of income generated, to induce virtuous and vicious circles of development. In the short term, trading volume is determined by exogenous shocks and short-run market dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Australian {{historical}} {{scholarship has}} traditionally neglected public employment services {{as an area}} of research. However, {{in recent years as}} the State has repositioned itself in the labour market the role of public employment services has become a popular area of debate. While contemporary scholars have contributed to these debates, their historical counterparts have been slower to follow suit. In overcoming this neglect, this thesis provides an historical examination of one of the earliest forms of state intervention into the Australian labour market: public employment services. This study examined the establishment and operations of public employment services in NSW from 1887 until 1942, when they were transferred across to the Federal Department of Labour and National Service, to comply with Commonwealth Wartime legislation. Within the Australian contemporary scholarship, public employment services have been conceptualised according to three dominant economic traditions: neo-classical economics, Keynesian economics and the writings of W. H. Beveridge. However, these traditions are predicated on inherent assumptions and predetermined outcomes, all of which fail to identify the origins and development of public employment services in Australia. Neo-classical economists have been the most critical arguing that the public provision of employments services is both inefficient and ineffective. Within the historical literature, Institutional economists in the United States have been influential in identifying the socio-economic factors that {{led to the development of}} the public employment services: <b>asymmetrical</b> labour <b>market</b> information and fraudulent acts perpetrated by private employment registries, all of which distorted the functioning of the labour market. By adopting the institutional economic approach, this thesis found that it was these socio-economic concerns that led to the introduction of the public employment service in NSW. This thesis disputes the claims of the neo-classical economists that the public employment services were both inefficient and ineffective, instead it argues that the public employment service played a pivotal role in the development of the NSW economy performing the role of labour market intermediary: channelling information and bringing together those wishing to buy and sell labour; while safeguarding those vulnerable in the labour market: the unemployed...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project explores {{the rise of}} Chinese cross-border finance. Cross-border investment programmes {{have been at the}} heart of Chinaâs financial liberalisation. Yet, we know little about what drives the expansion of these new market entry channels and the effects they have on global finance. This thesis explores the role that formal and informal institutions play in Chinaâs financial system, by addressing three main research goals: (1) to rethink analytical frameworks of global financial networks, by shifting the focus to channels of state power; (2) to investigate how such formal institutions shape competitive hierarchies in financial markets, both inside and outside of China; (3) to demonstrate that informal institutions such as a common cultural identity are equally important to explain behaviour and outcomes in Chinese cross-border finance. The thesis pursues this agenda through four substantive papers, each with its own subset of research goals and findings. 	 The papers follow a three-fold structure. The thesis begins with an analytical focus on agents (micro-level), by examining the evolution of state-firm relations in Chinese cross-border finance. The first paper develops a politically sensitive framework of global financial networks, which conceptualises how bargaining dynamics within Chinaâs party-state shape competitive hierarchies in Chinese capital markets. Drawing on these theoretical insights, the second paper breaks new empirical ground, by explaining the <b>asymmetrical</b> nature of <b>market</b> access criteria for foreign investors. The third paper zooms out on the global consequences that Chinese state control has for money centres (macro-level). It sheds light on how state-firm relations shaped Londonâs development as the first Western offshore trading centre for Chinese currency. The fourth paper shifts the attention to the role of informal social institutions in Chinese equity markets. It presents the first empirical study of how a common cultural identity with Mainland China governs the behaviour of different investor categories (group-level). 	 The thesis distils the following findings: Bargaining conflicts inside the Chinese party-state have a decisive impact on competitive outcomes and behaviour in Chinese cross-border finance, both domestically and globally. Strategic state interests form an interdependent relationship with the resources supplied by foreign investors and domestic corporate players. Domestically, these resource interdependencies explain the <b>asymmetrical</b> nature of <b>market</b> access under Chinaâs cross-border investment schemes. Globally, the shift in state-firm bargaining dynamics from strategic alignment to an increasing bifurcation of interests explains the patchy integration of RMB finance into Londonâs financial architectures. Informal social institutions equally shape competitive outcomes in Chinaâs capital markets. Whilst the literature identifies shared cultural identity as a source of local information advantage, this thesis finds the opposite: A common cultural background with national Chinese investors reduces information asymmetries for foreign investors but it does not equate to local information advantages. Overall, the four substantive papers add up to a multifaceted yet integrated perspective on the drivers, dynamics and consequences of Chinese cross-border finance. They clarify that the intersection of formal state governance and informal social forces is essential for understanding how the spread of neoliberal market forces unfolds across Chinese capital markets. This thesis thus affirms that space and place remain central to our understanding of financial market outcomes. </p...|$|R
40|$|Vegetable {{production}} {{is of great}} importance in terms of nutrition improvement, income generation and food security. Africa Research in Sustainable Intensification for the Next Generation (Africa RISNG) action research project actively integrates vegetable farming and marketing practices {{in order to reduce}} the vulnerability of indigenous populations of Babati district located in the Manyara region of Tanzania. In Tanzania smallholder vegetable famers receive <b>asymmetrical</b> and incomplete <b>market</b> information which is costly. Mobilizing farmers into groups so as to access viable market information while enhancing their bargaining power is one way to overcome this challenge. However, the extent to which this has been achieved has not yet been evaluated. This study sought to evaluate the influence of farmer organizations towards improving smallholder income in Babati. Objectives of the study were: to determine types of market information accessed by smallholder vegetable farmers through farmer organizations, determine factors influencing information seeking behaviour of vegetable farmers and determine effect of access to market provided by farmer organizations on smallholder vegetable farmer’s income. The target population was smallholder farmers who grow vegetables within maize based farming systems. Multi-stage sampling technique was employed where by 250 smallholders’ vegetable farmers were interviewed using structured questionnaire. The results showed that the type of market (29 %) is the most type of market information accessed by vegetable farmer through farmer organization. From the Poisson model the results show that distance to the market information source point has a negative influence on farmer’s information seeking behaviour. In contrast, gender, education, income and group membership had a significant positive relationship with farmers’ information seeking behaviour. In estimating the effect of access to market provided by farmer organizations on smallholder vegetable farmer’s income, Propensity Score Matching (PSM) was used. The results indicate that farmers who had access to the market provided by farmer organization have more income (501691. 413 TZS) than non member (405471. 429 TZS). From the results, it is recommended that an enabling policy environment that establishes and strengthens farmer organizations be supported. This will assist in transforming smallholder farming as viable business ventures through increased productivity and increased household incomes while reducing rural poverty.
