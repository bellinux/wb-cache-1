40|$|The {{relationship}} between strategic diversification management (at both the businesslevel and international level) and economic performance has been examined. Research on {{the link between}} economic performance and social responsibility reporting <b>and</b> <b>stakeholder</b> management suggested that consideration be given to managing stakeholders so that the firm achieves the objective of maximising economic performance. The dimensions- strategic <b>and</b> <b>stakeholder</b> concerns- have been empirically examined but only as two separate, distinct, fields of research. This paper develops an integrated strategic management <b>and</b> <b>stakeholder</b> concerns model framework for investigating economic performance that incorporates a combined business and society approach. It describes a socio-economic framework for investigating economic performance that does not treat strategic management <b>and</b> <b>stakeholder</b> concerns as separate issues. It identifies {{the need to develop}} an integrated socio-economic theoretical framework incorporating transactions cost, resource-based <b>and</b> instrumental <b>stakeholder</b> theory for investigating economic performance...|$|R

25|$|The {{objective}} of financial reporting {{is to provide}} information that is useful to management <b>and</b> <b>stakeholders</b> for resource allocation decisions. For financial information to be useful, it should be timely and free from material errors, omissions, and fraud. In the real time economy, timely and reliable financial information is critical for day-to-day business decisions regarding strategic planning, capital acquisition, credit decisions, supplier partnerships, and so forth. Advances in accounting information systems such as the advent of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have enabled the generation of real time information. However, the practice of traditional auditing has not kept pace with the real time economy. Traditional manual audit procedures are labor and time intensive, which limits audit frequency to a periodic basis, such as annually.|$|E

He invested in sponsoring voyages down the coast of Mauritania, gathering a group of merchants, shipowners <b>and</b> <b>stakeholders</b> interested in new sea lanes. Soon the Atlantic islands of Madeira (1419) and the Azores (1427) were reached. In particular, they were discovered by voyages launched by the command of Prince Henry the Navigator.

25|$|In {{the context}} of the social web, {{engagement}} means that customers <b>and</b> <b>stakeholders,</b> such as consumer advocacy groups and groups that criticize companies (e.g., lobby groups or advocacy organizations) are active participants rather than passive viewers. Social media use in a business or political context allows all consumers/citizens to express and share an opinion about a company's products, services or business practices, or a government's actioins. Each participating customer or non-customer (or citizen) who is participating online via social media becomes part of the marketing department (or a challenge to the marketing effort), as other customers read their positive or negative comments or reviews. Getting consumers and potential consumers (or citizens) to be engaged online is fundamental to successful social media marketing. With the advent of social media marketing, it has become increasingly important to gain customer interest in products and services, which can eventually be translated into buying behavior (or voting or donating behavior in a political context). New online marketing concepts of engagement and loyalty have emerged which aim to build customer participation and brand reputation.|$|E
25|$|Even {{with the}} UK's non-frustration {{principle}} directors always {{still have the}} option to persuade their shareholders through informed and reasoned argument that the share price offer is too low, or that the bidder may have ulterior motives that are bad for the company's employees, or for its ethical image. Under common law and the Takeover Code, directors must give out information to shareholders relevant to the bid, but not merely recommend the highest offer. The overriding common law rule, however, is to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest, which precludes using management powers for the purpose of frustrating takeovers. In Hogg v Cramphorn Ltd the director, purportedly concerned that a takeover bidder would make many workers redundant, issued a block of company shares to a trust, thus ensuring the bidder would remain outvoted. Buckley J held the power to issue shares creates fiduciary duty to only do so for the purpose of raising capital. Directors cannot plead they acted in good faith if a court determines their interests may possibly conflict. The result is that even though directors may wish to protect employees <b>and</b> <b>stakeholders</b> from ominous bidders, the law responds in other ways. UK workers have a minimal measure of job security, with very limited rights to be consulted, and no formal rights outside collective bargaining to participate in elections for the board or codetermine dismissal issues in works councils. Employees do have rights before dismissal or redundancies to reasonable notice, dismissal only for a fair reason, and a redundancy payment, under the Employment Rights Act 1996. Moreover, any changes to workers terms and conditions, or redundancies, following a restructuring through an asset (as opposed to share) sale triggers protection of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 meaning good economic, technical or organisational reasons must be given.|$|E
