5|$|The aim of {{administrative}} law is {{to regulate the}} executive government by providing remedies which individuals can apply for when challenging administrative actions and decisions, and failures to take action and make decisions. Where the exercise of statutory or other discretionary power by public authorities contravenes the Constitution or is unlawful under administrative law, various remedies may be <b>available</b> <b>when</b> a judicial review action is taken.|$|E

5|$|Because of delays from Stadler's subcontractors, five {{instead of}} eight trams were <b>available</b> <b>when</b> the line opened on 22 June 2010. Skyss {{had planned to}} operate with a ten-minute headway until August, but had a 15-minute headway until 16 August. To compensate, none of the {{parallel}} bus routes ceased until then. On 7 June, two trams collided at low speed at Byparken, causing a derailment and forced the two trams to be repaired. This caused the summer schedule to {{be reduced to a}} 30-minute headway. From 1 November, the line started running every six minutes during the rush hour. On 22 June, {{the first part of the}} line was officially opened by Queen Sonja of Norway.|$|E

5|$|Neither he nor Greenfield had {{run as a}} {{candidate}} in the election, and neither {{was a member of}} the legislature. Percival Baker, the UFA member elected for Ponoka, had died on election day, opening up a seat for one of them. A second seat, Peace River, became <b>available</b> <b>when</b> incumbent Donald MacBeth Kennedy resigned to run in the 1921 federal election. Greenfield seemed a more reasonable candidate for that rugged northern riding than the urban lawyer Brownlee, and so Brownlee was acclaimed as Ponoka's MLA December 9, 1921.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{features}} a multiplayer mode, in which 8 players race each other using the DS Download Play feature or a multi-card wireless LAN connection. Until its discontinuation on May 20, 2014, Mario Kart DS supported online play via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, in which up to 4 players could play together. When playing online, participants could only race against each other; Battle mode is not <b>available</b> <b>when</b> playing via an online connection. These features are not available in the Wii U VC version because the multiplayer features have not been emulated. R.O.B. is a middleweight character.|$|E
5|$|Lord Wilberforce, in Quistclose, {{stated that}} the {{contract}} gives the moneylender an equitable interest in the loan. Under Wilberforce's two-stage trust, the interest in the money first goes from the lender to the borrower (the primary trust) and then, when the trust's purpose fails, reverses (the secondary trust). In Twinsectra Lord Millett also explained that a Quistclose trust is a resulting trust, but held that the lender retains the interest throughout the transaction, with no need for this interest to reverse if {{the purpose of the}} loan fails. The problem with Wilberforce's analysis, as explained by Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Finance Law at the University of Exeter, is that because the resulting trust only comes into existence after the misuse of the loan, it may come too late; if the money is not <b>available</b> <b>when</b> the claim is brought, there is no remedy. The borrower may already have spent the money, or already be insolvent and the subject of claims by creditors.|$|E

5|$|With the {{uncertainty}} {{caused by the}} Utah War, the Church called off all European emigration for 1858. In 1859 one handcart company crossed the plains. The emigrants were now able to travel by rail to Saint Joseph, Missouri, after which they went by riverboat to Florence, where they were outfitted with handcarts and supplies. When the 1859 company reached Fort Laramie, they discovered their food was running dangerously short, so they cut back on rations. When they reached Devil's Gate the last flour was distributed. Emigrant Ebeneezer B. Beesley recalled an incident in which a group of rough mountain men fed the hungry emigrants. One of the mountain men then asked a young woman from the company to stay with him, which the tired woman agreed to do. (William Atkin recalled another {{version of the story}} in which two young women married two mountain men.) The hunger worsened when expected supplies were not <b>available</b> <b>when</b> they reached the Green River. Three days later wagons from Utah carrying provisions finally rescued the famished emigrants.|$|E
