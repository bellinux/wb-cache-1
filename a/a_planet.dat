5|$|<b>A</b> <b>planet</b> {{could also}} be perturbed from a distant {{circular}} orbit into an eccentric orbit by an encounter with another star. The in situ formation of <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> at this distance would require a very massive and extensive disk, or the outward drift of solids in a dissipating disk forming a narrow ring from which the planet accreted over a billion years. If <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> formed at such a great distance while the Sun was in its birth cluster, the probability of it remaining bound to the Sun in a highly eccentric orbit is roughly 10%. A previous paper found that a massive disk extending beyond 80 AU would drive Kozai oscillations of objects scattered outward by Jupiter and Saturn, leaving {{some of them in}} high inclination (inc > 50°), low eccentricity orbits which have not been observed.|$|E

5|$|Ceres (2.77AU) is {{the largest}} asteroid, a protoplanet, and a dwarf planet. It has a {{diameter}} of slightly under 1,000km, and a mass large enough for its own gravity to pull it into a spherical shape. Ceres was considered <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> when it was discovered in 1801, and was reclassified to asteroid in the 1850s as further observations revealed additional asteroids. It was classified as a dwarf planet in 2006 when the definition of <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> was created.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{direct effect}} of {{asteroid}} impacts on <b>a</b> <b>planet's</b> surface topography, global climate and life, {{recent studies have}} shown that several consecutive impacts might {{have an effect on the}} dynamo mechanism at <b>a</b> <b>planet's</b> core responsible for maintaining the magnetic field of the planet, and might eventually shut down the planet's magnetic field.|$|R
40|$|I {{model the}} effect of rapid stellar {{rotation}} on <b>a</b> <b>planet's</b> insolation. Fast-rotating stars have induced pole-to-equator temperature gradients (known as gravity-darkening) of up to several thousand Kelvin that affect the star's luminosity and peak emission wavelength {{as a function of}} latitude. When orbiting such <b>a</b> star, <b>a</b> <b>planet's</b> annual insolation can strongly vary depending on its orbit inclination. Specifically, inclined orbits result in temporary exposure to the star's hotter poles. I find that gravity-darkening can drive changes in <b>a</b> <b>planet's</b> equilibrium temperature of up to ∼ 15 % due to increased irradiance near the stellar poles. This effect can also vary <b>a</b> <b>planet's</b> exposure to UV radiation by up to ∼ 80 % throughout its orbit as it is exposed to an irradiance spectrum corresponding to different stellar effective temperatures over time.

5|$|HAT-P-33b is <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> in {{the orbit}} of HAT-P-33, which lies 1,367 light years away from Earth. Its {{discovery}} was reported in June 2011, although it was suspected to be <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> as early as 2004. The planet is about three-fourths the mass of Jupiter, but is almost eighty percent larger than Jupiter is; this inflation has, as {{with the discovery of}} similar planets WASP-17b and HAT-P-32b, raised the question of what (other than temperature) causes these planets to become so large.|$|E
5|$|One {{definition}} of a sub-brown dwarf is a planet-mass object that formed through cloud collapse rather than accretion. This formation distinction between a sub-brown dwarf and <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> is not universally agreed upon; astronomers are divided into two camps as whether to consider the formation process of <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> {{as part of its}} division in classification. One reason for the dissent is that often it may not be possible to determine the formation process. For example, <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> formed by accretion around a star may get ejected from the system to become free-floating, and likewise a sub-brown dwarf that formed on its own in a star cluster through cloud collapse may get captured into orbit around a star.|$|E

5|$|Several {{stars in}} Serpens {{have been found}} to have planets. The brightest, Omega Serpentis, located between Epsilon and Mu, is an orange giant with <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> of at least 1.7 Jupiter-masses. NN Serpentis, an eclipsing post-common-envelope binary {{consisting}} of a white dwarf and a red dwarf, is very likely to have two planets causing variations in the period of the eclipses.

5|$|Some comets meet a more {{spectacular}} end – either {{falling into the}} Sun or smashing into <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> or other body. Collisions between comets and planets or moons were common in the early Solar System: {{some of the many}} craters on the Moon, for example, may have been caused by comets.

5|$|The clumpy {{structure}} of the dust belt {{may be explained by}} gravitational perturbation from <b>a</b> <b>planet,</b> dubbed Epsilon Eridani b. The clumps in the dust occur at orbits that have an integer resonance with the orbit of the suspected planet. For example, the region of the disk that completes two orbits for every three orbits of <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> is in a 3:2 orbital resonance. In computer simulations the ring morphology can be reproduced by the capture of dust particles in 5:3 and 3:2 orbital resonances with <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> that has an orbital eccentricity of about 0.3. Alternatively, the clumpiness may have been caused by collisions between minor planets known as plutinos.|$|E

5|$|The {{defining}} {{dynamic characteristic}} of <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> {{is that it}} has cleared its neighborhood. <b>A</b> <b>planet</b> that has cleared its neighborhood has accumulated enough mass to gather up or sweep away all the planetesimals in its orbit. In effect, it orbits its star in isolation, as opposed to sharing its orbit with a multitude of similar-sized objects. This characteristic was mandated as part of the IAU's official definition of <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> in August, 2006. This criterion excludes such planetary bodies as Pluto, Eris and Ceres from full-fledged planethood, making them instead dwarf planets. Although to date this criterion only applies to the Solar System, a number of young extrasolar systems have been found in which evidence suggests orbital clearing is taking place within their circumstellar discs.|$|E

5|$|The {{search for}} Gliese 3634 b {{started with a}} single {{exposure}} taken with HARPS on March 25, 2009. The results helped verify that Gliese 3634 was an ideal target for <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> search using the radial velocity method (in which the gravitational pull of <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> on its star is measured by observing the resulting Doppler shift), as stellar activity would not overly mask or mimic Doppler spectroscopy measurements. It was also confirmed that Gliese 3634 is neither a binary star nor a quickly rotating star, common false positives when searching for transiting planets. Gliese 3634 was observed two weeks later for ten consecutive nights. Analysis of the resulting data found that the radial velocity variations most likely indicated the existence of <b>a</b> <b>planet.</b>|$|E
