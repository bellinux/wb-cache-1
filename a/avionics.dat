5|$|Developed in {{response}} to the American Polaris programme, the Tu-142 grew out of the need for a viable Soviet ASW platform. It succeeded the stillborn Tu-95PLO project, Tupolev's first attempt at modifying the Tu-95 for maritime use. The Tu-142 differed from the Tu-95 in having a stretched fuselage to accommodate specialised equipment for its ASW and surveillance roles, a reinforced undercarriage to support rough-field capability, improved <b>avionics</b> and weapons, and enhancements to general performance. The Tu-142's capability was incrementally improved while the type was in service, eventually resulting in the Tu-142MZ, the final long-range Tu-142 with highly sophisticated combat <b>avionics</b> and a large payload. Tupolev also converted a number of Tu-142s as <b>avionics</b> (Tu-142MP) and engine (Tu-142LL) testbeds.|$|E

40|$|International audienceElectronic sets {{operated}} on aircraft are usually summarized as “avionic architectures” (for “aviation electronic architecture”). Since the 70 s, <b>avionic</b> architectures, composed of digital processing modules and communication buses, are supporting {{more and more}} <b>avionic</b> applications such as flight control, flight management, etc. Hence, <b>avionic</b> architectures have become a central component of an aircraft. They have to ensure a large variety of important requirements: safety, robustness to equipment failures, determinism, and real-time. In response to these requirements, aircraft manufacturers have proposed several solutions. This article has a twin objectives: firstly to survey {{the state of the}} art of existing <b>avionic</b> architectures, including the IMA (for Integrated Modular <b>Avionic)</b> architecture of the most recent aircraft; and secondly to discuss two challenges for the next generation of <b>avionic</b> architectures: reconfiguration capabilities, and integrating COTS processing equipment such as multi-core processors. We believe that these two challenges will be central to the next generation of IMA architectures (called IMA- 2 G for IMA 2 d generation) ...|$|R
5|$|In June 1999, the {{contract}} to jointly develop and produce the Chengdu FC-1/Super 7 was signed. The project {{was to be a}} 50:50 partnership; the air forces of both countries would be committed to ordering the fighter. After GEC-Marconi had abandoned the bidding to supply an integrated <b>avionics</b> suite, FIAR and Thomson-CSF proposed a number of <b>avionics</b> suites based on the Grifo S7 and RC400 radars respectively, despite previously hoping to use the PAF's Super 7 to launch its new Blue Hawk radar. Because of sanctions placed on Pakistan after the country's 1998 nuclear weapons tests, design work progressed very slowly over the next 18 months, preventing delivery of the Western <b>avionics</b> to the PAF. In early 2001, the PAF decided to decouple the airframe from the <b>avionics,</b> enabling design work on the aircraft to continue. As the airframe was developed, any new <b>avionics</b> requirements by the PAF could be more easily integrated into the airframe.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal International Journal of Thermal Technologies and is available at [URL] It appears here with the kind permission of the publisher. Thermal management of aircraft heat loads is quickly becoming a limiting factor of vehicle performance and reliability. This paper details improvements in forced-convection cooled <b>avionic</b> module heat removal efficiency {{with the implementation of}} two-phase high thermal conductivity Vapour Chamber Heat Spreaders (VCHS). A bespoke test rig provides experimental thermal comparisons of an aluminium and embedded VCHS <b>avionic</b> heat exchanger. The experimental results validate a numerical thermal resistance network, which is utilised to simulate more representative <b>avionic</b> chassis geometries. The VCHS dramatically reduces thermal variation in circuit card and <b>avionic</b> heat exchanger exhaust temperatures. Increased isothermalisation of the heat exchanger greatly increases effective heat transfer area in comparison to a traditional aluminium chassis. The VCHS acts as a very effective thermal buffer between the <b>avionic</b> circuit cards and coolant airflow, allowing a more predictable <b>avionic</b> thermal behaviour irrespective of circuit card architecture. The improved heat rejection capability allows either a substantial increase in <b>avionic</b> growth capacity (increased power output for a fixed exhaust temperature) or a substantial reduction in mass flow rate (reduced demand on vehicle thermal management system). An <b>avionic</b> growth capacity of up to 58 % is achieved with representative thermal loading conditions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology {{to carry out}} the Assembly, Integration and Verification of the <b>avionic</b> system of a technological experiment on-board the International Space Station. The <b>avionic</b> system consists of three main subsystems, i. e. the on-board data handling, the electric power and the health management subsystem, and supports a technological experiment which focuses on the investigation of passive thermal control subsystem. The Assembly, Integration and Verification (AIV) campaign is a fundamental step of the design process, as the final objective of the AIV is to demonstrate that the end product meets the specified requirements. The selection of simple technical solutions and the necessity to keep cost down have driven the definition of the AIV plan, which has been tailored for the <b>avionic</b> system under consideration. Main purpose of the methodology for the Assembly, Integration and Verification is to provide the designer with a step-by-step procedure to accomplish the verification and validation of the <b>avionic</b> system. The methodology shall pursue an incremental approach, which defines the test plan from components to parts, subsystems and system levels through subsequent integrations. Being the AIV a crucial process for the mission reliability of any system, the proposed methodology shall pursue the enhancement of the system reliability and safety by defining, for instance, the most appropriate verification methods to verify the compliance with requirements, the tests to perform and the most correct tests sequence. Models philosophies are discussed and the most suitable model philosophy for the <b>avionic</b> system is selected. The methodology has been developed for the <b>avionic</b> system of a technological experiment but is flexible enough to be applicable to multi-purpose <b>avionic</b> system, capable to support different types of experiments. This paper provides an introduction to the <b>avionic</b> system, then it proceeds with the description of the AIV methodology and the main results obtained by its application to the <b>avionic</b> system.

For the fluid lines, the initial McDonnell Douglas analysis calculated 1 to 2 line failures over a 30 year period.
