In contrast to the Mirdasids, the Tayy consistently plundered their territory and its inhabitants. Moreover, the Fatimids would not tolerate independent rule in Palestine, which they viewed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Caliphate's survival.|$|E
5|$|Cambodian Rocks is a {{compilation}} of 22 uncredited, untitled Cambodian psychedelic and garage rock songs from the late 1960s and early 1970s. When the tracks were recorded, musicians in the thriving music scene were combining Western rock and pop genres with their own styles and techniques. When the Khmer Rouge {{came to power in}} 1975, artists were among those viewed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> regime's agrarian socialist vision, and several of the performers on the album are believed to have been among those killed during the ensuing Cambodian Genocide of 1975-1979. Little information about them or their creative output has survived.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{reputation}} as an able politician and a likable man, during his presidency Pierce served only as a moderator among the increasingly bitter factions that were driving the nation towards civil war. To Pierce, who saw slavery as a question of property rather than morality, the Union was sacred; because of this, he saw the actions of abolitionists, and the more moderate Free Soilers, as divisive and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> constitutionally-guaranteed rights of southerners. Although he criticized those who sought to limit or end slavery, he rarely rebuked southern politicians who took extreme position or opposed northern interests.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s, {{molecular}} biology was increasingly seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> traditional core of evolutionary biology. Established evolutionary biologists—particularly Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, and George Gaylord Simpson, {{three of the}} architects of the modern synthesis—were extremely skeptical of molecular approaches, especially {{when it came to the}} connection (or lack thereof) to natural selection. The molecular-clock hypothesis and the neutral theory were particularly controversial, spawning the neutralist-selectionist debate over the relative importance of mutation, drift and selection, which continued into the 1980s without a clear resolution.|$|E
5|$|In her {{treatment}} of the novel, María Regina Ruiz claims that power gives its wielder {{the ability to make}} prohibitions; prohibitions that are reflected in history, the study of which reveals what is and what is not told. The government's actions in The Feast of the Goat demonstrate the discourse of prohibition: foreign newspapers and magazines were prohibited from entering Trujillo's country as they were seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government's ideas. Mario Vargas Llosa takes part in this discourse by recounting what was prohibited.|$|E

It was later reopened by private owners, first in 1969 {{to serve as a}} mushroom farm and subsequently as a museum in 1984. A nature conservation organisation acquired the Fortress of Mimoyecques in 2010 and La Coupole, a former V-2 rocket base turned museum near Saint-Omer, took over its management.

Several days before the storm passed through the islands, an AC-130 aircraft was flown to the area and evacuated the people stationed on Tern Island, while a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration vessel evacuated the temporary residents on Laysan Island. Hurricane Neki caused relatively little damage in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument. All of the structures were undamaged; however, two small natural habitat islands, Round and Disappearing Islands, were affected substantially. The former lost some land area and the latter was completely washed away.|$|E
5|$|In 1514, Sultan Selim I (1512–1520) {{successfully}} {{expanded the}} empire's {{southern and eastern}} borders by defeating Shah Ismail I of the Safavid dynasty in the Battle of Chaldiran. In 1517, Selim I expanded Ottoman rule into Algeria and Egypt, and created a naval presence in the Red Sea. Subsequently, a contest started between the Ottoman and Portuguese empires to become the dominant sea power in the Indian Ocean, {{with a number of}} naval battles in the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf. The Portuguese presence in the Indian Ocean was perceived <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman monopoly over the ancient trade routes between East Asia and Western Europe. Despite the increasingly prominent European presence, the Ottoman Empire's trade with the east continued to flourish until {{the second half of the}} 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Sharp {{divisions}} among rebel factions {{became apparent}} during a second meeting in Saqba on 5 December. According to Syrian journalist Munir al-Rayyes, hostility between al-Kharrat and al-Shallash was well-known among the rebels. Because al-Shallash had levied war {{taxes on the}} major landlords and city elites of the Ghouta, al-Kharrat's benefactor al-Bakri viewed him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> traditional landowning class to which al-Bakri belonged. Al-Rayyis claimed the meeting was called for by al-Kharrat, who ordered his fighters to capture and bring al-Shallash to Saqba. However, according to al-'As, the summit was called by al-Shallash, and once the latter arrived in the village, al-Kharrat personally detained him and confiscated his horse, weapons and money.|$|E

5|$|The ARF {{gradually}} acquired significant {{strength and}} sympathy among Russian Armenians. Mainly {{because of the}} ARF's stance towards the Ottoman Empire, the party enjoyed {{the support of the}} central Russian administration, as tsarist and ARF foreign policy had the same alignment until 1903. On June 12, 1903, the tsarist authorities passed an edict to bring all Armenian Church property under imperial control. This was faced by strong ARF opposition, because the ARF perceived the tsarist edict <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Armenian national existence. As a result, the ARF leadership decided to defend Armenian churches by dispatching militiamen who acted as guards and by holding mass demonstrations.|$|E
5|$|Weaver {{embarked}} on a speaking tour across the northern plains and Pacific coast states. In late August, he turned South, hoping to break the Democrats' grip on those states. As in 1880, {{the issue of race}} hurt Weaver among white Southern voters, as he sought to attract black voters by urging cooperation between white and black farmers and calling for an end to lynchings. Weaver drew good crowds in the South, but {{he and his wife were}} also subjected to abuse from hecklers. Southern Democrats depicted Weaver <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conservative Democrats in power there; with the increasing disenfranchisement of black voters, this was to prove fatal to the Populists' hopes in the South.|$|E
5|$|During the 15th century, {{the common}} law courts were {{challenged}} by the civil law and equity found in the Chancery and similar courts. These courts and legal methods were much faster than {{the common law}} courts, so lawyers and claimants flocked to them. This was perceived <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> common law courts, for good reason; between 1460 and 1540, {{the business of the}} common law courts significantly dropped, while the Chancery's cases rose massively in number. In reaction to this, the Court of King's Bench developed its own, faster system, intent on winning cases back, and through procedures such as the Writ of Quominus and Bill of Middlesex acquired a wider jurisdiction. While this succeeded in forming an equilibrium between the old common law courts and the new courts, it was viewed with suspicion by the Common Pleas, who became highly reactionary to the changes the King's Bench attempted to introduce. When the King's Bench attempted to use the Bill of Middlesex to widen its jurisdiction, the Common Pleas became increasingly conservative in its attempts to avoid ceding cases. This was limited {{by the fact that the}} three Common Pleas prothonotaries could not agree on how to cut costs, leaving the court both expensive and of limited malleability while the King's Bench became faster, cheaper and more varied in its jurisdiction.|$|E

5|$|Shortly thereafter, {{conservative}} Polish nobility {{formed the}} Targowica Confederation {{to overthrow the}} Constitution, which they saw <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> traditional freedoms and privileges they enjoyed. The confederates aligned themselves with Russia's Catherine the Great, and the Russian army entered Poland, marking {{the start of the}} Polish–Russian War of 1792, also known as the War in Defense of the Constitution. The Sejm voted to increase the Polish Army to 100,000 men, but due to insufficient time and funds this number was never achieved. Poniatowski and the reformers could field only a 37,000-man army, many of them untested recruits. This army, under the command of the King's nephew Józef Poniatowski and Tadeusz Kościuszko, managed to defeat the Russians or fight them to a draw on several occasions. Following the victorious Battle of Zieleńce, in which Polish forces were commanded by his nephew, the king founded a new order, the Order of Virtuti Militari, to reward Poles for exceptional military leadership and courage in combat.|$|E
