5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E

[...] "I love her [...] work <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> idea to do like a really girl power, fun Valley girl video," [...] Spears claimed of the video partnership, adding {{that it was the}} first video she had done in a long time where she came up with the concept, also stating [...] "there’s a lot of dancing. I got new choreographers to come in and kind of do hip-hop dancing, which I haven’t done in a really long time, so the feel of the video is really different and hi-energy." ...|$|E

"I loved {{watching}} {{old black}} and white movies, and I always also loved the music of Glenn Miller and Cole Porter, that whole era of writing, {{and it was my}} attempt to write a song to depict the romantic era. It came out very quickly, I wrote it in about half an hour. Even though {{a lot of people think}} it sounds complicated, on the guitar it's very simple to play. It nearly never got recorded - when the time came to record it, the keyboard player I wanted to use, Peter Jones, was out of town, so we cut the band track with a different keyboard player. It didn't work. A few days later when we tried it again with a different keyboard player, again it didn't work, and the band was losing interest in the song. Just before the album was finished, Peter Jones came back into town, the band <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> argument because I wanted to give Reminiscing a third chance. Peter played on it, we cut it, and finished it, and sent the album to Capitol. Capitol said that they couldn't hear any singles on the album, and didn't know what to release. Five weeks later, someone at Capitol's New York office said 'You're all crazy, Reminiscing is a smash.' Capitol put it out, and it just immediately caught on fire, and became our highest chart hit." ...|$|E

60|$|My {{day was a}} busy one, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> early {{dinner at}} the Savage Club with Tarp Henry, to whom I gave some account of my adventures.

60|$|Mr. Colbert grinned a little, {{but said}} nothing.

6000|$|... "He was cold, but not harsh. I {{dare say}} my severe illness {{prevented}} him from being that.

60|$|Philadelphia, {{our next}} stop, had an especial {{significance}} to me (something {{quite apart from}} its historical significance). Outwardly professing {{a keen interest in}} the Liberty Bell, Independence Hall, and other objects which enthralled my young wife, I was secretly planning to offer Lorimer of The Post, the serial rights of my novel The Eagle's Heart, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> engagement to talk with Edward Bok about a novelette.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] I said, rather nonplussed. [...] "Really," [...] I continued, [...] "it's her {{extraordinary}} vehemence against Inglethorp {{that started}} me off suspecting her. I can't help feeling she'd do anything against him. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> idea she might {{know something about}} the destroying of the will. She might have burnt the new one, mistaking it for the earlier one in his favour. She is so terribly bitter against him." ...|$|E
60|$|My uncle drove {{for some}} time in silence, but I was {{conscious}} that his eye was always coming round to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> uneasy conviction that he was already beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had allowed his sister {{to persuade him to}} show her son something of the grand world in which he lived.|$|E

I have still in my pocket a document of great importance. I have no doubt whatever but that {{the object of the}} men who have taken my taxicab is to leave me in the street here alone under circumstances which will render a quick attack upon me likely to be successful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{to kill a}} man who {{had been}} as good to me as Mr. Compton was," [...] said Jimmy, [...] "or a man whom I admired so much as I did him.

6000|$|Veronica {{took off}} her things and put them away, each one in its proper place.
