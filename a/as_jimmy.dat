60|$|His {{meerschaum}} is {{not such}} a good one <b>as</b> <b>Jimmy's.</b> Though Jimmy's boastfulness about his meerschaum was hard to bear, none of us ever denied the pipe's worth. The man through the wall has not a cherry-wood stem to his meerschaum, and consequently it is too light. A ring has been worn into the palm of his left hand, owing to his tapping the meerschaum there, and it is <b>as</b> marked <b>as</b> <b>Jimmy's</b> ring, for, though Jimmy tapped more strongly, the man through the wall has to tap oftener.|$|R

5|$|Leeds City had {{finished}} 19th in the Second Division {{in the season}} preceding Chapman's arrival, and were facing re-election. Chapman played an essential part in lobbying for the side's readmission and Leeds City were duly re-elected.

5|$|Quadrophenia was revived for a {{film version}} in 1979, {{directed}} by Franc Roddam. The film attempted to portray an accurate visual interpretation of Townshend's vision of Jimmy and his surroundings, and included Phil Daniels <b>as</b> <b>Jimmy</b> and Sting as the Ace Face. Unlike the Tommy film, the music was largely relegated to the background, and was not performed by the cast as in a rock opera. The film soundtrack included three additional songs written by Townshend, which were Kenney Jones' first recordings as an official member of the Who. The film was a commercial and critical success, as it conveniently coincided with the mod revival movement of the late 1970s.|$|E

On the album, Carey worked with David Foster and Diane Warren, who, as well <b>as</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Jam & Terry Lewis, replaced Walter Afanasieff, the main balladeer Carey worked with throughout the 90s.
