40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis is about young Asian Dutch, panethnic Asian identities <b>and</b> <b>identifications,</b> <b>and</b> Asian/Asian Dutch popular culture. It addresses several pressing questions, including: why do young Asian Dutch, {{who were born}} and/or raised in the Netherlands, identify as Asian and construct Asian identities? What is the content or meaning of these Asian identities <b>and</b> <b>identifications</b> young Asian Dutch imagine? And how do these relate to young Asian Dutch’ Dutch and homeland identities <b>and</b> <b>identifications?</b> What factors, or markers of Asianness, drive young Asian Dutch’ <b>identification</b> with people <b>and</b> media characters of different Asian origin? How, if at all, do Asian parties {{and other forms of}} Asian popular culture facilitate the imagination of Asian identities <b>and</b> Asian <b>identification?</b> The answers to these and other questions addressed in this {{doctoral thesis}} will eventually lead to the fulfilment of the main objective, namely to explore and gain an understanding of the role of local Asian Dutch and transnational Asian popular culture in young Asian Dutch’ Asian cultural <b>identification</b> <b>and</b> their construction of Asian cultural identities...|$|R

Dark blue also proved effective under artificial illumination during night actions. Upper surfaces of aircraft operating from carrier decks were painted a similar shade of blue.

Although the Chiremba Balancing Rocks were retained, other features including latent imaging in which the letters RBZ can be seen when the banknote is tilted horizontally at the eye level <b>and</b> <b>identification</b> marks for the visually impaired were added to the design, and the neck of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark was longer.

5|$|The {{two largest}} {{users of the}} Harrier were the Royal Air Force and the United States Marine Corps (USMC). The {{exported}} model of the aircraft operated by the USMC was designated the AV-8A Harrier, which was broadly similar to the RAF's Harrier GR.1. Changes included the removal of all magnesium components, which corroded quickly at sea, and the integration of American radios <b>and</b> <b>Identification</b> Friend or Foe (IFF) systems; furthermore the outer pylons, unlike the RAF aircraft, were designed from delivery to be equipped with self-defence AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking air-to-air missiles. Most of the AV-8As had been delivered with the more powerful Pegasus engine used in the GR.3 instead of the one used in the earlier GR.1. Two-seat Harriers were operated for training purposes; the body was stretched and a taller tail fin added. The RAF trained in the T.2 and T.4 versions, while T.4N and T.8 were training versions the Navy's Sea Harrier, with appropriate fittings. The US and Spain flew the TAV-8A and TAV-8S, respectively.|$|E

The observatory managed the SNO experiment, which demonstrated that the solution to the solar neutrino problem was that neutrinos change flavour (type) as they propagate through the Sun. The SNO experiment proved that a non-zero mass neutrino exists. This was a major breakthrough in cosmology. In October 2015, Arthur B.
