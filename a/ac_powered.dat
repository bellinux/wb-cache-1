2500|$|By 1940 multisection tubes {{had become}} commonplace. There were constraints, however, due to patents and other {{licensing}} considerations (see British Valve Association). Constraints {{due to the}} number of external pins (leads) often forced the functions to share some of those external connections such as their cathode connections (in addition to the heater connection). The RCA Type 55 was a double diode triode used as a detector, automatic gain control rectifier and audio preamplifier in early <b>AC</b> <b>powered</b> radios. These sets often included the 53 Dual Triode Audio Output. Another early type of multi-section tube, the 6SN7, is a [...] "dual triode" [...] which performs the functions of two triode tubes, while taking up half as much space and costing less.|$|E

They are used to link <b>ac</b> <b>power</b> systems of different frequencies, to provide variable power frequency supplies for ac motor drives, and to generate constant frequency power from the output of variable-speed ac generators. AC/AC converters can be categorized into 1) Converters with a DC-link 2) Cycloconverters 3) Hybrid Matrix Converters 4...|$|R

50|$|The C428 {{would have}} been a 2,750-horsepower, four-axle locomotive, powered by the same engine as the C628. Due to the {{complexity}} of DC generators at this level of power, the <b>AC</b> <b>powered</b> C430 was developed instead.|$|E
50|$|Hazardous product {{pipelines}} {{are routinely}} {{protected by a}} coating supplemented with cathodic protection. An impressed current cathodic protection system (ICCP) for a pipeline consists of a DC power source, often an <b>AC</b> <b>powered</b> transformer rectifier and an anode, or array of anodes buried in the ground (the anode groundbed).|$|E

50|$|In {{a passive}} device, the <b>AC</b> <b>power</b> {{produced}} {{comes from the}} input DC bias current, the device absorbs DC power, some of which is converted to <b>AC</b> <b>power</b> by the nonlinearity of the device, amplifying the applied signal. Therefore, the output power {{is limited by the}} bias powerThe negative differential resistance region cannot include the origin, because it would then be able to amplify a signal with no applied DC bias current, producing <b>AC</b> <b>power</b> with no power input. The device also dissipates some power as heat, equal to the difference between the DC power in and the <b>AC</b> <b>power</b> out.|$|R

50|$|The first, class BB1, were <b>AC</b> <b>powered</b> {{and served}} as prototypes. The second, class BB2, were DC powered and served in the New York Terminal district, {{specifically}} between Sunnyside Yard and New York Penn Station. The third, class BB3, was <b>AC</b> <b>powered</b> and built for the Long Island Rail Road's electrified freight operation on the Bay Ridge Branch. In 1934 a follow-up order of 14 locomotives were built as single unit class B1 for the expanding main line AC electrification system. In addition to these new units all previous BB classes were split into single units and the BB2 class were re-powered for AC operation as that system replaced the old 650VDC system in the New York terminal. At this point all 42 units were re-classed as PRR B1.|$|E
50|$|A {{derivative}} of the thyristor drive is the simple AC phase controller. This uses a single phase controlled triac {{to provide a}} variable voltage AC output for regulating a universal motor. This {{is the type of}} motor speed control most commonly used in domestic appliances, such as food mixers, and small <b>AC</b> <b>powered</b> tools, such as electric drills.|$|E
5000|$|The heyday for grid-leak {{detectors}} was the 1920s, when battery-operated, multi-dial tuned {{radio frequency}} receivers using low-mu triodes with directly heated cathodes were the norm. The Zenith Models 11, 12, and 14 {{are examples of}} these kinds of radios. [...] When indirectly heated cathodes and <b>AC</b> <b>powered</b> receivers were introduced in 1927, most manufacturers switched to plate detectors, and later to diode detectors.|$|E

30|$|For {{contingency}} studies, if {{accuracy is}} more important than the time to produce the results, <b>AC</b> <b>power</b> flow based studies are required. Unlike the DC power flow based studies, reactive power is not neglected when computing an <b>AC</b> <b>power</b> flow based solution. Therefore, <b>AC</b> <b>power</b> flow based contingency studies not only allow analysis of steady state MVA line flows, but bus voltages can be determined and checked for under/over voltage conditions.|$|R
50|$|Inverters convert low {{frequency}} main <b>AC</b> <b>power</b> to higher frequency {{for use in}} induction heating. To do this, <b>AC</b> <b>power</b> is first rectified to provide DC power. The inverter then changes the DC power to high frequency <b>AC</b> <b>power.</b> Due to {{the reduction in the}} number of DC sources employed, the structure becomes more reliable and the output voltage has higher resolution due to an increase in the number of steps so that the reference sinusoidal voltage can be better achieved. This configuration has recently become very popular in <b>AC</b> <b>power</b> supply and adjustable speed drive applications. This new inverter can avoid extra clamping diodes or voltage balancing capacitors.|$|R

In 1935 the company began producing the electrically powered model trains that it became famous for, under the Trix Express label. Prior to the outbreak of World War II the Trix company produced a small range of fairly unrealistic <b>AC</b> <b>powered</b> three rail models running at 14 volts.|$|E

50|$|Space vector {{modulation}} (SVM) is an algorithm for {{the control}} of pulse width modulation (PWM).

There are variations of SVM that result in different quality and computational requirements. One active area of development is in the reduction of total harmonic distortion (THD) created by the rapid switching inherent to these algorithms.|$|E
50|$|Pull-through AC demagnetizing coils: seen in {{the figure}} to the right are <b>AC</b> <b>powered</b> devices that {{generate}} a high magnetic field where the part is slowly pulled through by hand or on a conveyor. The act of pulling the part through {{and away from the}} coil's magnetic field slows drops the magnetic field in the part. Note that many AC demagnetizing coils have power cycles of several seconds so the part must be passed through the coil and be several feet (meters) away before the demagnetizing cycle finishes or the part will have residual magnetization.|$|E

In honor of its past, the museum focuses on energy-related themes throughout its exhibit spaces and in its outreach programs.

5000|$|However, if {{direct current}} is used, the cable {{capacitance}} is charged {{only when the}} cable is first energized or if the voltage level changes; there is no additional current required.

This cable capacitance issue limits the length and power carrying ability of <b>AC</b> <b>powered</b> cables. [...] DC powered cables are limited only by their temperature rise and Ohm's Law. Although some leakage current flows through the dielectric insulator, this is small compared to the cable's rated current.|$|E
5000|$|Morley pedals became {{renowned for}} their rugged (albeit bulky) {{construction}} and overall high quality design.

When, in the early sixties, Cliff Richard's backing band [...] "The Shadows" [...] became hit-makers in their own right playing superb instrumentals, their then-innovative and unique sound was due not only to the talent of lead guitar player Hank Marvin but also to his choice of Fender guitars, and a Morley echo unit.|$|E
5000|$|The {{deviation}} provided {{double track}} where {{the frequency of}} train services is largely determined by the spacing of signals which sets the following distance. The capacity of the line was significantly improved when the deviation was equipped with a DC immune double line automatic signalling system using <b>AC</b> <b>powered</b> track circuits, searchlight signals, and motorised points. The signalling allowed for automatic double track operation, with up and down lines. This enabled trains to run at six-minute intervals between Wellington and Tawa Flat. To reduce potential delays, [...] "Stop and Proceed" [...] signals allowed trains stopped at a red signal to proceed at low speed if necessary to close up behind a previous train.|$|E
