5|$|Early critics, such as Thomas Campbell in 1838, {{saw this}} {{constant}} <b>allusion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> theatre {{as an indication}} that Prospero was meant to represent Shakespeare; the character's renunciation of magic thus signalling Shakespeare's farewell to the stage. This theory persists among later critics, and remains solidly within the critical canon.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quatrain, the poet elaborates upon his sentiments {{made in the}} first quatrain, {{comparing}} the present silence to the relationship when it was new. He uses seasonal imagery to set up his atmosphere, which he continues to use in line three, where we also encounter an <b>allusion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> myth of Philomela, {{which can be a}} poetic name for the nightingale.|$|E
5|$|Many reviewers {{identified}} an <b>allusion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Moors murders, {{committed by}} Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, a British couple who killed {{children in the}} 1960s. Ryan Lambie of Den of Geek also found similarities between the episode and Ian Huntley and Maxine Carr's crimes. The A.V.

5|$|In {{the scene}} when Homer, Bart and Lisa pick up Maggie from the daycare center, babies are perched {{all over the}} building, staring at the family and quietly sucking on pacifiers. This is a spoof of the final shot of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds. Indeed, a cartoon-version of Hitchcock can be seen walking his dogs past the daycare, a {{reference}} to his own cameo appearance in the film. The episode also contains an <b>allusion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opera scene in Citizen Kane, in which Homer plays with a shredded playbill while he watches {{his wife in the}} musical.|$|E
5|$|The {{net effect}} of the Dutch {{campaign}} was a pax Hollandica (Dutch peace), assuring VOC control in the southwest of the island. The Dutch called their new area of control the Verenigde Dorpen (United Villages), a deliberate <b>allusion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United Provinces of their homeland. The campaign was vital to the success and growth of the Dutch colony, which had operated {{as more of a}} trading post than a true colony until that point.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{contemporary}} Shah Jahan Mosque in Sindh, the interior walls of Wazir Khan Mosque are plastered and adorned with highly detailed buon frescoes The interior decorative style is unique for Mughal-era mosques, as it combines imperial Mughal elements with local Punjabi decorative styles. The main prayer hall contains a square pavilion {{over which the}} mosque's largest dome rests - a Persian form known as Char Taq. The underside of the dome feature frescoes depicting trees in pairs, pitchers of wine, and platters of fruit, which are an <b>allusion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Islamic concept of Paradise.|$|E

5|$|A less violent side to Alexander's {{government}} {{is demonstrated by}} other evidence. Over a century after his time, his administrative decisions were still being cited as precedents. Some of these are known from a surviving edict issued on July 6, 68, {{less than a month}} after Nero's death. This denounces, and introduces measures against, a variety of abuses including inaccurate tax assessments, malicious prosecutions and the imprisonment of debtors by private creditors. The edict's only <b>allusion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chaotic political situation comes as a call for trust in the benevolence of the new Emperor, Galba, and his ability to put right the wrongs of the past. Alexander was making representations to Galba on behalf of the provincials, presumably representing the desired reforms as the price of loyalty from this vital grain-producing province.|$|E
5|$|In the Life of Probus, {{the author}} 'Flavius Vopiscus of Syracuse' {{states that the}} Emperor's {{descendants}} (posteri) fled from Rome and settled near Verona. There a statue of Probus was struck by lightning, a portent according to soothsayers 'that future generations of the family would rise to such distinction in the senate they all would hold the highest posts', though Vopiscus (supposedly writing under Constantine) says this prophecy has not yet come to pass. This {{is one of the}} strongest indications of the History's late 4th-century date, as {{it seems to be a}} fairly transparent <b>allusion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rich and powerful senator Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus (consul in 371) whose two sons held the consulship together in 395. Petronius Probus was born in Verona.|$|E
5|$|John Henry Johnson (November 24, 1929 – June 3, 2011) was a {{gridiron}} football {{running back}} {{known for his}} excellence at the fullback position as both a runner and a blocker. His first professional stint was in Canada in the Western Interprovincial Football Union (WIFU) for one season with the Calgary Stampeders. He then played in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers, Detroit Lions, and Pittsburgh Steelers before spending his final season in the American Football League (AFL) with the Houston Oilers. Commonly referred to as simply John Henry, an <b>allusion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> folk hero of the same name, Johnson was a tough and tenacious player who performed {{at a high level}} well into the tail end of his career.|$|E
50|$|I {{made some}} <b>allusions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> strong {{opinions}} expressed by many persons {{on the history}} of the creation, its grandeur, and then their treatment of the earlier chapters of the Book of Genesis.|$|R
50|$|In The Real Life of Sebastian Knight {{the author}} Nabokov treats his affair with Irina Guadanini through <b>allusions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{myth of the}} poison damsel. The trope also appears {{in a set of}} Nathaniel Hawthorne's stories.|$|R

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} elements of the painting is the ring on the model's ring finger. Resting on the mantle piece, it becomes a {{focal point of the}} composition. The ring was a device of which Whistler was conscious; it had not been present in The White Girl. Though he and Hiffernan were not married, the ring showed a development in how he represented her in his art; from prostitute in Wapping, to mistress in The White Girl, and finally a wife in The Little White Girl. At the same time, this development reflected Whistler's notion of his own position in the English art world: towards greater legitimacy. The ring is also an <b>allusion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Christian sacrament of marriage, which lends a religious aspect to the aestheticism that he and Swinburne were trying to develop.|$|E
5|$|Rabies {{has been}} linked with vampire folklore. Dr Juan Gómez-Alonso, a {{neurologist}} at Xeral Hospital in Vigo, Spain, examined this possibility in a report in Neurology. The susceptibility to garlic and light {{could be due to}} hypersensitivity, which is a symptom of rabies. The disease can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and hypersexuality. Legend once said a man was not rabid if he could look at his own reflection (an <b>allusion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> legend that vampires have no reflection). Wolves and bats, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies. The disease can also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth.|$|E
5|$|The other {{national}} symbol that was chosen in the 1995 referendum {{was the national}} emblem. The elements of the emblem include a ribbon in {{the colors of the}} national flag, a map of Belarus, wheat ears and a red star. At the base of the ribbon, it says the country's official name in the Belarusian language. The emblem is an <b>allusion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> one used by the Byelorussian SSR, designed by Ivan Dubasov in 1950. In the Soviet version, a hammer and sickle replaced the map of Belarus and the ribbon was all red. On the left and right ribbons, the Soviet motto Workers of the world, unite! appeared in the Belarusian and Russian languages.|$|E
50|$|In the 1730s, Russell, {{along with}} John Martyn, edited the Grub-Street Journal. Alexander Pope was a {{frequent}} contributor. The journal has a satirical tone with abundant <b>allusions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> contemporary people and events of politics, literature and journalism.|$|R
25|$|In Angel Sanctuary, Yuki {{incorporated}} references <b>to</b> several mythologies. <b>The</b> series includes {{references to}} Greek mythology, with <b>allusions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Orpheus' descent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> underworld, the mythical location Hades, Pandora's box, and Prometheus. Additionally, the transgender demon Arachne takes her {{name from the}} weaver Arachne. References to Norse mythology also appears, with <b>allusions</b> <b>to</b> Yggdrasil and <b>the</b> dragon Nidhogg. Other mythologies alluded to include Jewish and Christian mythology; Yuki used quotes from the Bible periodically in the series.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> {{writing on}} <b>the</b> history of scientific theories, Slava Gerovitch is writing poetry in English and Russian. His lyric poetry contains <b>allusions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> works of Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, Pushkin, Trakl, Pasternak, Mandelshtam, Nabokov, Brodsky, and Okudzhava.|$|R
5|$|The same year, on the {{occasion}} of Eusebi Güell's obtaining the title of count, Gaudí designed a coat of arms for his patron. He devised a shield with the lower part in a catenary shape typical of Gaudí. He divided it into two parts: the lantern of Palau Güell features a dove and a gear-wheel on the right in <b>allusion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Colònia Güell in Santa Coloma de Cervelló (coloma is Catalan for dove), with the phrase ahir pastor (yesterday Shepherd). On the left is an owl perched on a half-moon—symbol of prudence and wisdom—with the words avuy senyor (today Lord). The shield is surmounted by a helmet with the count's coronet and the dove symbol of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|Whistler {{created the}} {{painting}} {{in the winter of}} 1861–62, though he later returned to it and made alterations. It was rejected both at the Royal Academy and at the Salon in Paris, but eventually accepted at the Salon des Refusés in 1863. This exhibition also featured Édouard Manet's famous Déjeuner sur l'herbe, and together the two works gained a lot of attention. The White Girl shows clearly the influence of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, with whom Whistler had recently come in contact. The painting has been interpreted by later art critics both as an allegory of innocence and its loss, and as a religious <b>allusion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Virgin Mary.|$|E
5|$|In North America, California is {{the leading}} {{producer}} of Sauvignon blanc with plantings also found in Washington state and on the Niagara Peninsula and Okanagan Valley in Canada. Sauvignon Blanc is also grown in small regions in Ohio along Lake Erie and the Ohio River. In California wine produced from the Sauvignon blanc grape {{is also known as}} Fumé Blanc. This California wine was first made by Napa Valley's Robert Mondavi Winery in 1968. Mondavi had been offered a crop of particularly good Sauvignon blanc grapes by a grower. At that time the variety had a poor reputation in California due to its grassy flavor and aggressive aromas. Mondavi decided to try to tame that aggressiveness with barrel agings and released the wine under the name Fumé Blanc as an <b>allusion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French Pouilly-Fumé. The usage of the term is primarily a marketing base one with California wine makers choosing whichever name they prefer. Both oaked and unoaked Sauvignon blanc wines have been marketed under the name Fumé Blanc. California Sauvignon blancs tend to fall into two styles. The New Zealand-influenced Sauvignon blanc have more tropical fruit undertones with citrus and passion fruit notes. The Mondavi-influenced Fumé Blanc are more round with melon notes.|$|E
50|$|The Genocides makes many <b>allusions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Old Testament. The end of {{the story}} mirrors the story of Adam and Eve. The {{character}} Jeremiah Orville's name is biblical and refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prophet Jeremiah. Both witness the destruction of a city.|$|R
50|$|A {{large part}} of the {{narrative}} is dominated by Ray's <b>allusions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> moral decadence {{of the city and the}} youth in particular. During several scenes, Ray makes use of dream sequences and memory sequences <b>to</b> portray <b>the</b> thoughts of Siddhartha.|$|R
50|$|From the {{beginning}} of Elul through Hoshanah Rabbah (and outside of Israel, on Shemini Atzeret as well), Nusach Ashkenaz recites Psalm 27, which contains many <b>allusions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Days of Awe and Sukkot. This is again followed by the mourner's Kaddish.|$|R
