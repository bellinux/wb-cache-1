Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they <b>are</b> <b>learning</b> to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E

When applied to computers, HTM is well suited for prediction, anomaly detection, classification and ultimately sensorimotor applications.|$|E

25|$|Much {{of the use}} of and {{research}} on interactive writing takes place in the field of second language learning, whether students <b>are</b> <b>learning</b> English or another world language (Chinese, French, Spanish, etc.). Dialogue journals are reported as valuable instructional tools in language classes with children and adolescents, with university students, and with adults in adult education programs. The writing can take place between students and the teacher or between language learners and native language speakers. The purposes might be overall language acquisition, development of writing abilities, extension of learning of the language beyond time in class, promotion of ability to transition to academic writing in university classes, and easing of the trauma of transition to life in the United States.|$|E

25|$|The program {{offers an}} {{opportunity}} for students to develop an appreciation for different cultures and promotes greater understanding.

Some local schools may request specific topics for volunteers to present about their country, especially if the students <b>are</b> <b>learning</b> it in class. If not, a simple PowerPoint with basic background information including geography, language, food, music, dance, sports, holidays, weather, and celebrations is sufficient. The content and depth of presentations depends on whether volunteers will be presenting to elementary, middle school or high school students or adults. Usually presentations will also include an activity for children to get involved such as learning a dance, song, game or several words and phrases in the language.|$|E

25|$|Collective {{intelligence}} strongly {{contributes to}} the shift of knowledge and power from the individual to the collective. According to Eric S. Raymond (1998) and JC Herz (2005), open source intelligence will eventually generate superior outcomes to knowledge generated by proprietary software developed within corporations (Flew 2008). Media theorist Henry Jenkins sees collective intelligence as an 'alternative source of media power', related to convergence culture. He draws attention to education and the way people <b>are</b> <b>learning</b> to participate in knowledge cultures outside formal learning settings. Henry Jenkins criticizes schools which promote 'autonomous problem solvers and self-contained learners' while remaining hostile to learning through the means of collective intelligence. Both Pierre Lévy (2007) and Henry Jenkins (2008) support the claim that collective intelligence is important for democratization, as it is interlinked with knowledge-based culture and sustained by collective idea sharing, and thus contributes {{to a better understanding}} of diverse society.|$|E

Using this framework of language to clarify the &# 8220;what&# 8221; of learning, we take the acquisition of null (and overt) subjects in languages like Spanish {{as an example of}} how to apply the framework. We demonstrate what properties of a null-subject grammar cannot <b>be</b> <b>learned</b> explicitly, which properties can, but also argue that it is an open empirical question as to whether these latter properties <b>are</b> <b>learned</b> using explicit processes, showing how linguistic and psychological approaches may intersect to better understand acquisition...|$|R
