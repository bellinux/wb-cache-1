5|$|On 11 April 1939 he {{narrowly}} {{escaped with}} his life alongside Geoffrey de Havilland; both men parachuting to safety. They had taken a Moth Minor into the air to test its response to spins. The prototypes had an <b>anti-spin</b> parachute but preceding tests had been carried out without the need to resort to the safety measure. Geoffrey put the aircraft into a left-hand spin which was recovered. Climbing back to 8,000 feet the aircraft was put into it a right-hand spin. The engine cut out, the nose reared-up and the aircraft stalled and entered a flat spin. Geoffrey asked John through the Gosport tube to try to escape their perilous situation after the controls proved non-responsive to de Havilland's efforts. Both decided to parachute out. Upon doing so the Moth declined its nose and recovered from the spin. The engine ignition had been left on and the wind-milling propeller started the engine. The aircraft began circling the descending airmen at dangerously close range. Fortunately it descended {{at a faster rate}} and was destroyed when it hit the ground. Cunningham casually took pictures of the wreckage and his parachute which exemplified his cool nature.|$|E

When it came to be tested in Argentina, Curtiss-Wright representatives, eager to sell the Curtiss 75, pointed out that the Vought was fitted with an <b>anti-spin</b> parachute in the tail. When the Argentines demanded that the spin characteristics be demonstrated without the <b>anti-spin</b> parachute, Vought refused, and the Curtiss 75 was selected by the Argentines instead.|$|E

50|$|The {{competing}} bids {{were evaluated by}} the Air Corps in April 1936. Vought offered to sell V-141s at a unit price of $34,148 for a batch of 25 aircraft (excluding engines and Government provided equipment), reducing to $16,041 for a batch of 200 aircraft. Testing showed that the V-141 still had poor handling and was prone to spinning, and also suffered from tail flutter, leading to the Vought design being rejected. The primary winner of the competition was Seversky, with 77 P-35s being ordered. Vought then decided to offer its fighter for export, modifying it with larger tail surfaces and renaming it the Vought V-143.

50|$|The P.111A first flew on 2 July 1953 from Boscombe Down. Shortly {{afterwards}} the <b>anti-spin</b> parachute {{mounted on}} the rear port fuselage was strengthened {{so it could be}} deployed as a braking parachute and the pilot was given control over the strength of the power controls.

Although full power was applied, the aircraft entered into a flat spin, and crashed at Felthorpe, killing all on board. It was not fitted with an <b>anti-spin</b> parachute.

Other notable components of the W30 package included a lightweight aluminum intake manifold, the W25 fiberglass ram-air hood, <b>anti-spin</b> differential with 3.42:1 gears (3.73:1 available), and heavy duty cooling. Due to the low-vacuum at idle, air conditioning was not available, and power brakes were only available with an automatic transmission. Only 113 W30 convertibles and 659 W30 coupes were made in 1972, making this a very rare option.|$|E
50|$|Both British-built {{and early}} Canadian-built Chipmunks are notably {{different}} from the later Canadian-built RCAF/Lebanese versions. The later Canadian-built aircraft were fitted with a bubble canopy, which replaced the multi-panelled sliding canopy {{that had been used}} upon early Canadian-produced Chipmunks, along with all of the Portuguese and British-built aircraft. On the early-built canopy, the rearmost panels were intentionally bulged in order to provide the instructor's position with superior visibility. British-built Chipmunks also differed by a number of adjustments to suit the expressed preferences of the RAF. These included the repositioning of the undercarriage legs, the adoption of a variable-pitch propeller, <b>anti-spin</b> strakes, landing lights, and an all-round stressed airframe.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} of the Chipmunk makes heavy use of metal, {{the majority of the}} airframe being composed of a stress-skinned alloy; this allowed the adoption of thinner wings and consequently provided for increased performance as well as a greater degree of durability. Numerous features were incorporated in order for the type to better perform in its trainer role, including hand-operated single-slotted wing flaps, <b>anti-spin</b> strakes, disc brakes on the wheeled undercarriage, a thin propeller composed of a solid lightweight alloy, the adoption of an engine-driven vacuum pump in place of external venture tubes to power cockpit instrumentation, electric and Coffman cartridge engine starters as alternative options, cockpit lighting, onboard radio system, and an external identification light underneath the starboard wing.|$|E
50|$|On 1 October 1940, the XF4U-1 {{became the}} first {{single-engine}} U.S. fighter to fly faster than 400 mph by setting an average ground speed of 405 mph during a northeastwards flight from Stratford to Hartford. The USAAC's twin engine Lockheed P-38 Lightning had flown over 400 mph in January-February 1939. The XF4U-1 also had an excellent rate of climb but testing revealed that some requirements {{would have to be}} rewritten. In full-power dive tests, speeds of up to 550 mph were achieved but not without damage to the control surfaces and access panels and, in one case, an engine failure.

50|$|The {{starting}} point was a Mk. 10 or Mk. 21 {{version of the}} Chipmunk. The modifications included a redesigned fuselage to accommodate a 50 Imperial gallon (227 l) hopper located where the front seat {{was found in the}} original aircraft, and a completely new cockpit in the location of the original rear seat. An air-driven spray pump was mounted under the forward fuselage. The pilot sat 11 inches (28 cm) higher than in the original aircraft. A turnover truss and a new energy-absorbing seat were provided to protect the pilot from injury in a crash; and cable cutters were mounted in front of the cockpit as protection against one of the main hazards to agricultural aircraft (flying into power or telephone lines). A small dorsal fin and <b>anti-spin</b> strakes were fitted to the rear fuselage as well.|$|E
5000|$|In 1961, an {{optional}} locking mechanism consisting of an outer hex nut encasing a captured threaded barrel {{was added to}} the 874 line. [...] It {{can be seen in the}} photograph of a GR-900 to GR-874 adapter,. The locking assembly is not captive and can be backed off the RF connector. The threaded barrel is supplied on each connector. The threaded barrel was withdrawn into the nut on one connector and extended on the other to allow the barrel to engage the nut of both mating connectors. This style of locking mechanism was continued in GR-874's thematic successors; the GR-900 precision 14 mm connector that retains a crenelated hermaphroditic mechanical <b>anti-spin</b> feature to protect the sexless RF interface from rotating and galling when the locking mechanism is tightened, and the fully sexless APC-7 7 mm connector.|$|E
5000|$|The Miles M.14 was {{designed}} to meet Air Ministry Specification T.40/36 and was first flown on 20 March 1937 by F.G. Miles and then christened 'Magister'. Based on Miles' Hawk Trainer, the Magister is an open-cockpit, low wing cantilever monoplane of spruce structure covered in plywood. The wing centre section has no dihedral and is of constant section with outer sections having dihedral and tapering towards the tip. It has a fixed tailwheel undercarriage with spats on the main wheels. Split flaps are fitted as standard. [...] Early Magisters (including the first prototype) suffered a number of accidents when the aircraft could not be recovered from a spin. To solve this problem, the tailplane was raised by 6 in, <b>anti-spin</b> strakes fitted to the rear fuselage, and eventually, a new taller rudder. Thus modified, the aircraft became the definitive M.14A.|$|E
50|$|The Tiger Moth {{became the}} {{foremost}} primary trainer throughout the Commonwealth and elsewhere. It {{was the principal}} type used in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan where thousands of military pilots got their first taste of flight in this robust little machine. The RAF found the Tiger Moth's handling ideal for training future fighter pilots. Whilst generally docile and forgiving in the normal flight phases encountered during initial training, when used for aerobatic and formation training the Tiger Moth required definite skill and concentration to perform well — a botched manoeuvre could easily cause the aircraft to stall or spin. From 1941 onwards, all military and many civil Tiger Moths were outfitted with <b>anti-spin</b> strakes positioned on the junction between the fuselage and {{the leading edge of}} the tailplane, known as Mod 112; later on, the aileron mass balances were removed for improved spin recovery performance.|$|E
