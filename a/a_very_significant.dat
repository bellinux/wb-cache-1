Most other Polish cities have suffered similarly, but the processes in Białystok, have had a particularly intense course. Numerous historic works of architecture no longer exist, while many others have been rebuilt to their original configuration. Very few historic buildings of the city have been preserved – the sights are merely an echo of the old historical shape of Białystok.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century Stretford was {{a largely}} {{agricultural}} village. The development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town, beginning in the late 19th century, had a significant effect on Stretford's subsequent development. At its peak in 1945 the park employed an estimated 75,000workers; housing and other amenities had to be constructed on what had previously been agricultural land. Trafford Park is still <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>significant</b> source of employment, containing an estimated 1,400 companies and employing about 44,000 people. As at the 2001 UK census, 0.3% of Stretford's working population was employed in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{occurs on}} dry land, but the females {{return to the}} edge of the sea to release their fertilised eggs and then retreat back up the beach. The larvae that hatch are planktonic for 3–4 weeks, before {{settling}} to the sea floor, entering a gastropod shell and returning to dry land. Sexual maturity is reached after about 5 years, and the total lifespan may be over 60 years. In the 3–4 weeks that the larvae remain in the sea their chance of reaching another suitable location will be enhanced if they find a floating life support system. It is commonly agreed that floating logs or rafts of storm-struck vegetation would be suitable, although rather chancy and definitely seasonal. In contrast, floating coconuts can be <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>significant</b> part of the crab's dispersal options.|$|E

We were eager to know the effect of chronic administration of RJN on the lipid profile test. To find out the effect of chronic administration of RJN on the lipid profile it was administered chronically to the male Sprague-Dawley rats at a dose of 40 ml/Kg. After 28 days of chronic administration of the RJN preparation, the following effects on the lipid profile were noted. There was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> highly <b>significant</b> increase in LDL Cholesterol (p= 0. 001). <b>A</b> <b>very</b> highly <b>significant</b> (0. 001) decrease was noticed in triglyceride (TG), VLDL-C & HDL-C level; thus leading to <b>a</b> statistically <b>very</b> highly <b>significant</b> (p= 0. 001) increase in Cardiac Risk Ratio (CRR) (TC/HDL-C), Castelli’s Risk Index-II (CRI-II) (HDL-C/LDL-C) and Atherogenic Coefficient (AC) [(TC/HDL-C) /HDL-C) ], but a statistically significant (p= 0. 033) decrease in case of Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP) (log (TG/HDL-C)) ...|$|R

Their efforts organized the Kurdish Peshmerga to defeat Ansar Al Islam in Northern Iraq before the invasion. This battle was for control of a territory in Northeastern Iraq that was completely occupied by Ansar Al Islam, an ally of Al Qaeda. This was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>significant</b> battle and led to the termination of a substantial number of terrorists and the uncovering of a chemical weapons facility at Sargat. These terrorists {{would have been in the}} subsequent insurgency had they not been eliminated during this battle. Sargat was the only facility of its type discovered in the Iraq war. This battle may have been the Tora Bora of Iraq, but it was a sound defeat for Al Qaeda and their ally Ansar Al Islam. This combined team then led the Peshmerga against Saddam's northern Army. This effort kept Saddam's forces in the north and denied the ability to redeploy to contest the invasion force coming from the south. This effort may have saved the lives of hundreds if not thousands of coalition service men and women.|$|E
