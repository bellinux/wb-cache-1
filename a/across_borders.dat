5|$|Another {{effect of}} the common European {{currency}} is that differences in prices—in particular in price levels—should decrease because {{of the law of}} one price. Differences in prices can trigger arbitrage, i.e., speculative trade in a commodity <b>across</b> <b>borders</b> purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition. Some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets.|$|E
5|$|Gambira faced a {{total of}} sixteen charges {{for his role in}} the protests, {{including}} membership in an unlawful association and illegal movement <b>across</b> <b>borders.</b> In October 2008, Gambira's lawyer, Aung Thein, resigned from his case, saying that the military government would not allow him the materials to prepare an adequate defence. On one occasion, Gambira refused to appear in court himself, stating that the trial of a forcibly disrobed monk was disrespectful to Buddhism.|$|E

Signalling systems also differ. In addition to the infrastructure difficulties, any potential Eurostar services beyond Paris and Brussels would also require the installation of stringent security measures, due to the UK's not having signed up to the Schengen Agreement, which allows unrestricted movement <b>across</b> <b>borders</b> of member countries.|$|E
5|$|A {{country with}} a large trade surplus would {{generally}} see {{the value of its}} currency appreciate relative to other currencies, which would reduce the imbalance as the relative price of its exports increases. This currency appreciation occurs as the importing country sells its currency to buy the exporting country's currency used to purchase the goods. Alternatively, trade imbalances can be reduced if a country encouraged domestic saving by restricting or penalising the flow of capital <b>across</b> <b>borders,</b> or by raising interest rates, although this benefit is likely offset by slowing down the economy and increasing government interest payments.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the market}} {{turbulence}} of the 1990s financial crises and September 11 {{attacks on the}} U.S. in 2001, financial integration intensified among developed nations and emerging markets, with substantial growth in capital flows among banks and in the trading of financial derivatives and structured finance products. Worldwide international capital flows grew from $3 trillion to $11 trillion U.S. dollars from 2002 to 2007, primarily {{in the form of}} short-term money market instruments. The United States experienced growth in the size and complexity of firms engaged in a broad range of financial services <b>across</b> <b>borders</b> {{in the wake of the}} Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999 which repealed the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, ending limitations on commercial banks' investment banking activity. Industrialized nations began relying more on foreign capital to finance domestic investment opportunities, resulting in unprecedented capital flows to advanced economies from developing countries, as reflected by global imbalances which grew to 6% of gross world product in 2007 from 3% in 2001.|$|E
