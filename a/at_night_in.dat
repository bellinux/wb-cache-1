5|$|A herbivore, {{the royal}} {{antelope}} prefers small quantities of fresh foliage and shoots; fruits and fungi {{may be taken}} occasionally. Though the antelope {{is considered to be}} nocturnal, zoologist Jonathan Kingdon holds that feeding occurs throughout the day, though some foraging may also be observed <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> <b>In</b> comparison to Bates's pygmy antelope, the royal antelope has a longer muzzle, broader lips, a smaller mouth and smaller cheek muscles. These features do not allow complete digestion of lignified growth. Individuals may often move into new locations foraging for fresh growth.|$|E

5|$|Author Robert R. Frump {{wrote in}} The Man-eaters of Eden that Mozambican {{refugees}} regularly crossing Kruger National Park <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> South Africa are attacked and eaten by the lions; park officials have conceded that man-eating {{is a problem}} there. Frump believes thousands may {{have been killed in}} the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the park at night. For nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly walked across the park in daytime with little harm.|$|E
5|$|Black-headed sugar ants are nocturnal foragers of food. The {{species is}} {{sometimes}} considered a household pest since ants can enter human homes <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> search of food. During the day, these ants are not active and have exhibited sleep-like behaviours {{until it is}} night. The black-headed sugar ant predominantly feeds on sweet secretions and sugar water; insects {{and a variety of}} foodstuffs in human homes are also consumed.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in the day, an FAA {{specialist}} {{had informed}} the crew {{that it would}} be illegal to land <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> Aspen under instrument flight rules. In addition, the crew were aware that due to noise abatement restrictions, their jet aircraft was required to land at Aspen by the 18:58 MST night curfew. Following the delayed departure from LAX, their estimated arrival time was 18:46 MST, twelve minutes before the curfew took effect.|$|E

5|$|Mistle thrushes {{are found}} as {{individuals}} or pairs {{for much of}} the year, although families forage together in late summer, and groups may merge to form flocks of several tens of birds; {{it is not uncommon for}} up to 50 thrushes to feed together at that time of year. They roost <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> trees or bushes, again typically as individuals or pairs, but with families roosting together in autumn.|$|E
5|$|Nightcrawler is a 2014 American thriller film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Dan Gilroy. It stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Lou Bloom, a stringer who records violent events late <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> Los Angeles, and sells the footage to a local television news station. Rene Russo, Riz Ahmed and Bill Paxton also star. A common theme in the film is the symbiotic relationship between unethical journalism and consumer demand.|$|E
5|$|The adult has {{two pairs}} of long, narrow, multiveined, {{translucent}} wings and a long, slender abdomen. Although they somewhat resemble dragonflies or damselflies, they belong to a different infraclass of winged insects. Antlion adults are easily distinguished from damselflies by their prominent, apically clubbed antennae which are {{about as long as}} the head and thorax combined. Also, the pattern of wing venation differs, and compared to damselflies, the adults are very feeble fliers and are normally found fluttering about <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> search of a mate. Adult antlions are typically nocturnal, and rarely seen by day.|$|E

5|$|The most {{frequently}} encountered bioluminescent organisms {{may be the}} dinoflagellates present in the surface layers of the sea, which {{are responsible for the}} sparkling phosphorescence sometimes seen <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> disturbed water. At least eighteen genera exhibit luminosity. A different effect is the thousands of square miles of the ocean which shine with the light produced by bioluminescent bacteria, known as mareel or the milky seas effect.|$|E
5|$|A {{highlight}} of the series in 1959 was when the Russians allowed Moore {{to be the first}} Westerner to see the photographic results of the Luna 3 probe, and to show them live on air. Less successful was the transmission of the Luna 4 probe, which ran into technical difficulties and around this time Moore famously swallowed a large fly; both episodes were live and Moore had to continue regardless. He was invited to visit the Soviet Union, where he met Yuri Gagarin, the first man to journey into outer space. For the fiftieth episode of The Sky <b>at</b> <b>Night,</b> <b>in</b> September 1961, Moore's attempt {{to be the first to}} broadcast a live direct telescopic view of a planet resulted in another unintended 'comedy episode', as cloud obscured the sky.|$|E
5|$|About {{half the}} {{potential}} prey that hit orb webs escape. A web has to perform three functions: intercepting the prey (intersection), absorbing its momentum without breaking (stopping), and trapping the prey by entangling it or sticking to it (retention). No single design {{is best for}} all prey. For example: wider spacing of lines will increase the web's area and hence its ability to intercept prey, but reduce its stopping power and retention; closer spacing, larger sticky droplets and thicker lines would improve retention, but {{would make it easier}} for potential prey to see and avoid the web, at least during the day. However, there are no consistent differences between orb webs built for use during the day and those built for use <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> <b>In</b> fact, there is no simple relationship between orb web design features and the prey they capture, as each orb-weaving species takes a wide range of prey.|$|E

5|$|Australian aircrew {{supported}} the fighting on 6 June. No.453 Squadron {{was one of}} 36 Allied squadrons that provided low-altitude air defence for the invasion fleet and landing force. Many of the squadron's pilots flew several sorties during the day, though they did not encounter any German aircraft. No.456 Squadron also formed part of the force that provided air defence for the invasion area <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> <b>In</b> addition, about 200 Australian pilots were spread across the dozens of RAF fighter and fighter-bomber units that {{supported the}} landings. A small number of Australian aircrew also served in RAF reconnaissance units and 2TAF's light bomber squadrons, which also saw combat over France on D-Day. The three Australian squadrons assigned to Coastal Command flew {{only a small number}} of sorties on 6 June as few German submarines or E-boats put to sea.|$|E
5|$|By Your Side was {{released}} on January12, 1999. The album's cover art is a blue-tinted nighttime photograph of the band, all dressed in white and {{standing in front of}} a lake. The band name is rendered in tiny white lights above their heads, and other small white lights are scattered at their feet. In keeping with the tiny lights theme, the back of the booklet shows a satellite image of the United States <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>in</b> which densely populated areas can be discerned by light pollution, and the booklet contains drawings of constellations. The album's disc artwork is designed after a centaur with a crow's head in place of the man's head.|$|E
5|$|Douglas Trumbull was {{the visual}} effects supervisor, while Carlo Rambaldi {{designed}} the aliens. Trumbull joked that the visual effects budget, at $3.3million, {{could have been}} used to produce an additional film. His work helped lead to advances in motion control photography. The mother ship was designed by Ralph McQuarrie and built by Greg Jein. The look of the ship was inspired by an oil refinery Spielberg saw <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> India. Instead of the metallic hardware look used in Star Wars, the emphasis was on a more luminescent look for the UFOs. One of the UFO models was an oxygen mask with lights attached to it, used because of its irregular shape. As a subtle in-joke, Dennis Muren (who had just finished working on Star Wars) put a small R2-D2 model onto the underside of the mothership. The model of the mothership is now on display in the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy Annex at Washington Dulles Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.|$|E
