5|$|Martin {{checked out}} and {{returned}} to Singapore on 19 March. On that day the skulls of the Damudes were found in a disused tin mine in Kathu district. A torso and a pair each of arms <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> were found along Bahn Nai Trang Road, 9.7kilometres (6mi) away, five days later. The body parts were so badly decomposed that visual identification was impossible; Royal Thai Police used dental records to identify the skulls and forensic analysis concluded that the torso, arms, <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> {{were likely to be}} Sheila's. The other parts of Darin's body were never found.|$|E

30|$|Based on Figure  22, {{with the}} step pitch varying from 0.05  m to 0.2  m, {{it can be}} {{concluded}} that the curves of the maximum normal forces of the feet are mostly uniform for <b>leg</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>leg</b> 5, for <b>leg</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>leg</b> 4, <b>and</b> for <b>leg</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>leg</b> 5, respectively.

Figure  22 shows that the maximum normal forces of the feet gradually increase with the step pitch varying for legs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.

40|$|Background. Few {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} prospectively age-related body composition changes and {{their relationships with}} worsening disability in the elderly population. Methods. Ninety-seven women and 62 men aged 71. 4 6 2. 2 and 71. 66 2. 2 years, respectively, at baseline underwent dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry determinations at baseline and at 2 - and 5. 5 -year follow-up intervals to measure total body <b>and</b> <b>leg</b> fat (FM) <b>and</b> total, appendicular, <b>and</b> <b>leg</b> fat-free mass (FFM). Height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference (as well as reported disabilities using a four-level scale) were evaluated at baseline and at 2 - and 5. 5 -year follow-up. Results. In both sexes, total FM did not change significantly, while total, appendicular, <b>and</b> <b>leg</b> FFM significantly decreased over the study follow-up. In men and women losing weight, BMI, total <b>and</b> <b>leg</b> FM, <b>and</b> total, appendicular, <b>and</b> <b>leg</b> FFM significantly decreased. In weight-stable men and women, appendicular <b>and</b> <b>leg</b> FFM significantly decreased and BMI, waist circumference, and total FM significantly increased. Men lost significantly more total, appendicular, <b>and</b> <b>leg</b> FFM than did women, irrespective of whether they maintained or lost weight. Over the follow-up period, 43. 3 % of women and 43. 5 % of men declined {{in one or more}} levels of reported disability. We evaluated the effect of age, baseline BMI, FM, FFM, number of diseases, baseline 6 -minute walking test, categories of weight change, total, appendicular, or leg FFM changes, total FM and waist changes on the probability of a decline in one or more levels of reported disability score ove...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the genetic correlations between body <b>and</b> <b>leg</b> structure traits. The study was conducted at a commercial farm and involved 1449 females. Evaluated soundness traits consisted of six body structure traits, five leg structure traits per <b>leg</b> pair <b>and</b> overall <b>leg</b> action. Variance components were estimated using a multivariate repeatability animal model. The heritability estimates for body structure traits were low to moderate <b>and</b> for <b>leg</b> traits primarily low. The genetic correlations between body <b>and</b> <b>leg</b> structure traits were often favorable i. e. improvements in body structure were associated with improvements in leg structure. Furthermore, long and shallow body, high top line and steep hip structure were significantly associated with inferior leg action (P ≤ 0. 05). Therefore, in addition to selecting animals with superior feet <b>and</b> <b>leg</b> soundness, the body structure information could be utilized to enhance otherwise relatively slow genetic progress in <b>leg</b> structure <b>and</b> overall <b>leg</b> action...|$|R
5|$|Occasionally a Portia {{is killed}} or injured while {{pursuing}} prey up to twice Portia′s size. In tests, P. schultzi is killed in 1.7% of pursuits and injured but not killed in 5.3%, P. labiata is killed in 2.1% and injured but not killed in 3.9%, and P. fimbriata in Queensland is killed in 0.06% of its pursuits and injured but not killed in another 0.06%. A Portia′s especially tough skin often prevents injury, even when its body {{is caught in}} the other spider's fangs. When injured, Portia bleeds and may sometimes loses one or more legs. Spiders' palps <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> break off easily when attacked, Portia′s palps <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> break off exceptionally easily, which may be a defence mechanism, and Portias are often seen with missing legs or palps, while other salticids in the same habitat are not seen with missing legs or palps.|$|E
5|$|Seneb's {{dwarfism}} {{is depicted}} realistically in the sculpture. It portrays {{him with a}} large head but small arms <b>and</b> <b>legs.</b> This possibly indicates that he had achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism that most severely affects the fastest-growing {{parts of the body}} – particularly the femur and humerus, which become short and squat – and stunts the forearms and lower legs. It also affects the head, producing a relatively large skull with a bulging forehead and often a depressed nasal bridge. An alternative diagnosis is dysmelia – a condition that produces short arms <b>and</b> <b>legs.</b> Seneb's wife Senites is portrayed far less realistically; her depiction is of a piece with other contemporary portraits of high-ranking Egyptian women.|$|E
