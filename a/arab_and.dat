5|$|Before 1948, Haifa's Municipality {{was fairly}} unusual as it {{developed}} {{cooperation between the}} mixed <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> Jewish community in the city, with representatives of both groups involved in the city's management. Under mayor al-Haj, between 1920 and 1927, the city council had six <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> two Jewish representatives, with the city run as a mixed municipality with overall Arab control. Greater cooperation was introduced under Hasan Bey Shukri, who adopted a positive and conciliatory attitude toward the city's Jews and gave them senior posts in the municipality. In 1940, the first Jewish mayor, Shabtai Levy, was elected. Levy's two deputies were Arab (one Muslim, the other Christian), with {{the remainder of the}} council made up of four Jews and six Arabs.|$|E

Fosters was forced to withdraw in May 2000 when its financial backing collapsed due to pressure from human rights groups.|$|E
5|$|Many writers {{wrote about}} the deeds of Odaenathus; Nicostratus of Trebizond {{probably}} accompanied the king on his campaigns and wrote a history of that period starting from Philip the <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> ending shortly before the king's death.

5|$|Mogadishu is a {{multi-ethnic}} city. Its original core population {{consisted of}} Bushmen aboriginals, and later Cushitic, <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> Persian migrants. The mixture of these various groups produced the Benadiri or Reer Xamar (“People of Mogadishu”), a composite population {{unique to the}} larger Benadir region.

5|$|The {{original}} Mamilla Street {{extended from}} the Mamilla Pool to Jaffa Gate. Along this street, wealthy Arabs constructed homes, offices and stores in the 1800s.

5|$|The {{population}} of Gaza is overwhelmingly composed of Muslims, who mostly follow Sunni Islam.

Most women and children from those villages took refuge in Simele and Dohuk.|$|E

While {{there are}} general divisions between <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> Jewish neighborhoods, there is an increasing trend for wealthy Arabs to move into affluent Jewish neighborhoods.

5|$|According to the French Byzantinist Henri Grégoire, the Byzantine success {{against the}} Arabs that culminated with the Battle of Lalakaon {{inspired}} {{the creation of}} one of the oldest surviving acritic (heroic) poems: the Song of Armouris. Grégoire claimed that the eponymous protagonist, the young Byzantine warrior Armouris, was actually inspired by Emperor Michael III. A battle from the Byzantine heroic cycle around Digenis Akritas also strongly recalls the events of Lalakaon, as the eponymous hero surrounds an Arab army near Malakopeia. Strong influences can be found in episodes in the <b>Arab,</b> <b>and</b> later Turkish, epic cycles around Battal Ghazi, as well as an episode in the One Thousand and One Nights.|$|E

The orchestra was awarded the Israel Prize in 2006.|$|E

5|$|At {{a meeting}} on 29 November, the United Nations General Assembly decided to end the British Mandate on 1August1948. Palestine would be {{partitioned}} into separate <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> Jewish states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. The Jewish state would have fifty-six per cent of the land {{with a population of}} 490,000Jews and 325,000Arabs, while the Arab state would have 807,000Arabs, but only 10,000Jews. The population of Jerusalem would be around 105,000Arabs to 100,000Jews.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of Crusader reign in Nablus, Muslim forces {{launched}} incursions to regain control of the city. In 1137, <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> Turkish troops stationed in Damascus raided Nablus, killing many Christians and burning down the city's churches. However, they were unsuccessful in retaking the city. Queen Melisende of Jerusalem resided in Nablus from 1150 to 1161, after she was granted control over the city in order to resolve a dispute with her son Baldwin III. Crusaders began building Christian institutions in Nablus, including a church dedicated to the Passion and Resurrection of Jesus, and in 1170 they erected a hospice for pilgrims.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by the British, 265,000 Jewish immigrants, {{mainly from}} Europe, came {{to settle in}} Palestine between 1919 and 1939.

Then in May1939, the British restricted the number of Jewish immigrants to 75,000 in the White Paper of 1939.|$|E
