5|$|Chester Rock Light was <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> Chester, Connecticut on the Connecticut River. It {{was built}} in 1889 {{as part of a}} $15,000 {{appropriation}} by the United States Congress. The 21-foot (6.4 meter) tall wooden hexagonal pyramidal tower had a black lantern with a 6th order Fresnel lens. The light was first lit on July 1, 1889. The tower was replaced in 1912 by a skeleton tower that was subsequently modified in 1927. Records do not show the deactivation or destruction of the light, but it was believed to have been removed in the 1930s. In the 1990s, the Deep River Historical Society of Deep River, Connecticut wanted to build a replica of the structure for use as a daymark.|$|E

25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

500|$|Fears were {{as high as}} ever {{among the}} traumatised fire victims, fear of foreign arsonists and of a French and Dutch invasion. There was an {{outbreak}} of general panic on Wednesday night in the encampments at Parliament Hill, Moorfields, and Islington. <b>A</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> the sky over Fleet Street started a story that 50,000 French and Dutch immigrants had risen, widely rumoured to have started the fire, and were marching towards Moorfields to finish what the fire had begun: to cut the men's throats, rape the women, and steal their few possessions. Surging into the streets, the frightened mob fell on any foreigners whom they happened to encounter, and were only appeased, according to Evelyn, [...] "with infinite pains and great difficulty" [...] and pushed back into the fields by the Trained Bands, troops of Life Guards, {{and members of the}} court.|$|E

[...] Elysa Gardner, editor from the Los Angeles Times, called the song [...] "earnestly passionate" [...] and felt Carey sounded her [...] "most impressive" [...] on the song. Amy Linden from Vibe also reviewed the song positively, calling Carey's vocal performance in the song [...] "emotional" [...] and [...] "graceful."

500|$|... "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)" [...] {{is a slow}} tempo {{song that}} blends pop and R beats. Additionally, it {{incorporates}} its sound from several instruments including the violin, piano and organ. The ballad {{is set in the}} signature of common time, with a slowly tempo of 52 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A major, with Carey's vocals spanning almost three octaves, from the low note of A2 to the high note of F#5. Although the song was written by Carey and Diane Warren, the latter does not usually share songwriting credit. Although there were no conflicts during the recording process, the pair had minor disagreements during the songwriting stages: Carey said that Warren liked to repeat lyrical phrases often. The second song that Carey and Warren wrote together was [...] "There for Me" [...] which was released as a B-side to the [...] "Never Too Far/Hero Medley" [...] charity single Carey recorded in late 2001. The song's protagonist details the struggles of dealing with people who put you down, and how to overcome these struggles through faith, courage, and the power of God. Carey explains in the song's lyrics how although people can try to make her feel down and depressed, no matter what happens, she can't let them win: [...] "There's <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> me that shines brightly. They can try but they can't take that away from me." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller. [...] It opens with a scene of Stefani and Kanal holding each other. [...] During the chorus, she runs to a church while wearing a wedding dress designed after a fashion show by John Galliano, while her bandmates run after her. [...] During the next verse, Stefani and guitarist Tom Dumont sit on a couch, and Stefani gets up on the table while Dumont plays an acoustic guitar. [...] Stefani has a nightmare during the second chorus, in which she is in an endless hall full of wedding cakes, attempting to stop her bandmates from destroying them. [...] There is then a dream sequence in which Stefani is backlit {{in front of a}} circle of stars. [...] She sits with Young for the third verse, during which point in time <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> the shape of a birth control pills flashes, with one missing pill. This coincides with her line [...] "Sometime I wished/For a mistake," [...] referencing her desire to get pregnant. In the video, Young quickly stands up and leaves after her line [...] "You seem like you'd be a good dad" [...] to play with Dumont and Kanal. [...] The band walks through a cemetery, and Stefani finds a baby. [...] Her bandmates extend their arms to hold the baby, but Stefani hands the baby off to a woman and enters her trailer to remove her makeup.|$|E
