50|$|The Roman Catholic Church itself {{recognizes that}} there are churches not in communion with Rome which possess apostolic {{succession}} and thus valid sacraments. However, when referring to apostolic succession, a distinction can be drawn between <b>a</b> minimalist <b>understanding</b> and <b>a</b> broader <b>understanding</b> of the term. <b>A</b> minimalist <b>understanding</b> highlights that bishops can trace their own ordination back to the Apostles whilst <b>a</b> broader <b>understanding</b> speaks of handing on {{the faith of the}} Apostles.

The doctrine is based on <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive.
