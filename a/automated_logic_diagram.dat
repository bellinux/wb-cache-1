40|$|Control {{function}} verification is {{an important}} task in current engineering design. Traditional researches usually focus on the final function validation when the control system has already been implemented on a hardware controller. However, {{it would be more}} useful if design errors are found in earlier stages of design. <b>Logic</b> <b>diagram,</b> as a popular middle medium, plays a critical role in the current design practices, especially for medium-sized and large-sized control systems. Therefore, verification of the design specifications of the <b>logic</b> <b>diagrams</b> is an interesting topic in order to find and eliminate the design errors in an early stage. In this thesis, we provide a viable approach to verify the design functions of the <b>logic</b> <b>diagrams</b> which is based on the modular supervisory control of Discrete-Event Systems. We create models for basic logic gates and introduce buffers to obtain automaton representation of <b>logic</b> <b>diagrams</b> After converting the informal verbal specifications to automata, we can verify whether the <b>logic</b> <b>diagram</b> satisfies these specifications with the help of TTCT (a computer program based on automata for analysis and design of supervisory control systems). A formal proof of controllability and a semi-formal proof of nonblocking property are given. An industrial-sized example is studied to demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology...|$|R

Data access is optimized {{by the use of}} intelligent agents. Technology <b>Logic</b> <b>Diagram</b> documents published for the DOE facilities in Oak Ridge (K- 25, X- 10, Y- 12) were chosen for this effort because of the large number of technologies identified, described, evaluated, and ranked for possible use in the environmental remediation of these facilities.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{cognitive}} study of diagrammatic representations for deductive reasoning, the availability of syntactic manipulation of diagrams has {{played a key role in}} accounting for their efficacy. Currently, however, little has been known about the interface between such syntactic or proof-theoretical aspects and the corresponding semantic or informational aspects of diagram use. The present paper investigates the cognitive processes of interpreting diagrammatic representations underlying deductive reasoning, combining the insights from both logical and cognitive studies of diagrams. A semantical analysis of two different ways of formalizing <b>logic</b> <b>diagrams</b> is provided. Based on it, a multiple stage model of cognitive processes of extracting information from <b>logic</b> <b>diagrams</b> is proposed, and evidence was found to support this model.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} risk {{management}} approach for university-affiliated, small satellite programs. These small programs {{have a unique}} set of risks because of a typically inexperienced workforce, limited corporate knowledge, occasional distributed tasking among universities, and a high student turnover rate. Only those risks unique to small, student-run satellite programs are presented. Additionally, several risk management strategies are explored, and {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} these risk-related tools and techniques are examined. To aid the process of risk identification in these particular programs, a Master <b>Logic</b> <b>Diagram</b> (MLD) for small satellites was created to help identify potential initiating events that could lead to failures during the mission. To validate the MLD, a case study is presented and analyzed. This Master <b>Logic</b> <b>Diagram</b> approach is shown to provide an effective method that can be easily adapted for risk identification in small, student-run satellite programs...|$|R

The WBS is neither a statement-of-work nor a work authorization document. Rather, it is a framework around which to define requirements, plan effort, assign responsibilities, allocate and control resources, and report progress, expenditures, technical performance, and schedule performance.

Most systems reported in the literature [1, 3, 6] imposed severe restrictions on the input diagrams to improve the recognition accuracy, and are very sensitive to the change of domain knowledge while taking little care to the efficiency [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Although <b>logic</b> <b>diagrams</b> {{are widely}} used as methods for {{introducing}} students to elementary logical reasoning, it is still open to debate in cognitive psychology whether diagrams can aid untrained people to successfully conduct deductive reasoning. In our previous work, some empirical evidence was provided for {{the effectiveness of a}} certain type of <b>logic</b> <b>diagrams</b> in the process of solving categorical syllogisms. However, the question of why certain diagrams but not others have such inferential efficacy in performing syllogism reasoning has not been fully answered. Based on a proof-theoretical analysis of categorical syllogisms and diagrammatic reasoning, we supplement our previous study of cognitive efficacy of diagrams and argue that the relational information underlying quantified sentences plays a crucial role in understanding the efficacy of diagrams in syllogistic reasoning. The distinctive features of our conception of diagrammatic reasoning are made clear by comparing it with the model-theoretic conception of ordinary reasoning developed in the mental model theory...|$|R
