50|$|Short-distance {{spread of}} the disease occurs through {{transmission}} of the viruses by insect vectors. Little cherry virus-2 is spread by scale insects of the family Pseudococcidae, primarily the <b>apple</b> <b>mealybug</b> (Phenacoccus aceris). In areas where the <b>apple</b> <b>mealybug</b> is commonplace, application of insecticides prior to cutting infected trees are routinely used {{to stop the spread of}} little cherry disease within orchards. Little cherry virus-1 is spread by an unknown vector.Little cherry disease likely originated in Japan and spread with ornamental cherry trees world-wide; many of the top cherry producing nations in the world have reported infections, including USA, Italy and Spain.|$|E
50|$|Little cherry {{disease was}} first {{identified}} in 1933 in the Kootenay region, British Columbia, where the economically important cherry industry was severely affected. Probably {{introduced to the}} region with ornamental cherry trees and spread by the large <b>apple</b> <b>mealybug</b> population in the area, the virus infected trees in almost all orchards. Over 30 000 trees were killed during the subsequent fifteen years after introduction and cherry production dropped from 680 000 kg in 1947 to 68 000 kg in 1979, when the last cherry packing line closed. Cherry production in the region resumed in 1996 after mandatory control programs had been put in place.In 1938, parasitic wasps {{were introduced to the}} area as biocontrol agents in an attempt to manage the apple mealy bug population, with some success in limiting the speed at which the viruses spread.|$|E
40|$|Grapevine leafroll {{disease is}} caused by grapevine leafroll-associated viruses (GLRaVs). These viruses are common in {{vineyards}} worldwide and often associated with vitiviruses {{that are involved in}} the rugose wood complex of grapevine. Ten mealybug species are known as vectors of one or several of these grapevine viruses, including the <b>apple</b> <b>mealybug</b> Phenacoccus aceris which is widespread in Holarctic regions and able to transmit Grapevine leafroll-associated virus- 1 and - 3 (GLRaV- 1 and - 3). Our aim was to characterize the transmission features of leafroll viruses by Phenacoccus aceris in order to better understand the contribution of this mealybug to leafroll epidemics. Results showed that Phenacoccus aceris is able to transmit GLRaV- 1, - 3, - 4, - 5, - 6, and - 9 to grapevine but not GLRaV- 7. This is the first report of GLRaV- 6 transmission by a mealybug. Also, for the first time it was shown that Phenacoccus aceris could vector vitiviruses Grapevine virus A (GVA) and Grapevine virus B (GVB). First instar nymphs were the most efficient stage in transmitting GLRaV- 1, - 3, and GVA. This research sheds light on the transmission biology of grapevine viruses by Phenacoccus aceris and represents a step forward to leafroll disease management.

40|$|The tuber mealybug, Pseudococcus viburni, has a {{worldwide}} distribution, being found in South Africa, United States of America, South America, New Zealand, Europe, Bangladesh, China and Australia. Tuber mealybug is found on {{all parts of}} the plant and is considered {{to be the most important}} of the underground mealybug pests in Australia. Tuber mealybug became an important pest of apples and pears at Stanthorpe, Queensland in 1993. The longtail mealybug Pseudococcus longispinus, previously a pest only in southern states, is now present in many Queensland <b>apple</b> orchards. <b>Mealybug</b> infestations on pome fruit result in the development of black sooty mould which grows on the sticky honey dew at the stem and calyx ends of the fruit. Such fruit is unmarketable as fresh fruit. Infested fruit is rejected for export to overseas countries as export standards require nil live insects. Control of tuber mealybug and longtail mealybug in pome fruit relies mainly on insecticides with generally unsatisfactory results. The wasp parasitoid, Pseudaphycus maculipennis was introduced into Queensland orchards and follow up work needs to be done to confirm the status of this biological control species. Cryptolaemus montrouzieri (Cryptolaemus) also can be effective in biological control of <b>mealybugs</b> in <b>apple</b> orchards and is commercially available. The differences between the two pest species of mealybug are difficult to establish morphologically and it would highly advantageous to develop a PCR assay to aid in accurate identification. A PCR assay was developed and show great promise in accurately identifying the two mealybug pest species. Correct identification is important in selecting effective control measures for each species. Mass releases of Cryptolaemus reduced mealybug populations but not sufficiently to satisfy the expectations of the fresh produce market. Further field research investigating the use of adult beetles instead of larvae, different timings of releases and more use of control blocks is likely to demonstrate better mealybug control using Cryptolaemus. The PCR analysis was highly promising and further work is required to prove the rigour of an accurate assay...|$|R
