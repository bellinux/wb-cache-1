40|$|Because {{of their}} {{interesting}} damping properties, aluminum foams are widely considered a promising material for applications {{in which the}} dynamic behavior of a mechanical structure needs to be improved [1]. The present work focuses on the application of an innovative kind of composite foam, the Hybrid APM foam, used to improve the overall dynamic performance of machine tools structures and in particular of milling centers steel structures. Hybrid APM foams were chosen as a filling material {{because they have been}} proven [2] to be able to enhance the performance of smaller but comparable steel structures and because the foaming phase can be easily integrated in the well-established manufacturing process of welded steel components [3]. The machine tool analyzed in the present study is LinX Compact 20 produced by Jobs, {{one of the most important}} Italian machine tool manufacturers. LinX is a high speed 5 -axis milling centre (Fig. 1) with mobile crossbeam characterized by linear motors on linear axes. The transversal <b>axis</b> <b>stroke</b> (Y) is 2000 mm, the vertical stroke (Z) is 1250 mm while the longitudinal stroke (X) is modular up to 8200 mm. The machine can be equipped with a wide range of milling heads, specifically designed for car design & prototyping, high power machining for aerospace industry and mould and die machining. Even if the use of a damping material is a core part of this work, its main goal is the development of an overall redesign strategy of the machine tool structure, focusing on the maximization of performance indexes directly related to customer needs identified for the specific machining centre, i. e. increasing the material removal rate for steel roughing and tracking accuracy for finishing operations. This strategy goes through few phases: experimental measurement of the current performance of the milling centre, identification of the critical issues and components limiting the indexes, FEM assisted re-design, prototyping, performance reassessment and economic evaluation of the improved performance indexes. The performance assessment on the LinX, both original and foam filled, was carried out using milling tests, to determine the maximum achievable depth of cut for a selected operation, and a tracking test, to measure the maximum deviation from the nominal trajectory. An experimental modal analysis was then performed on the original machine in order to identify the critical components. These components were redesigned using FE models and structural optimization. The resulting preliminary redesign was then extensively discussed and revised in close collaboration between JOBS spa, and MUSP laboratory in order to ensure the feasibility of the components and their integration with the existing structure. The new components were then prototyped by JOBS and foamed at MUSP Laboratory. Finally, a new complete series of tests was performed on the assembled milling centre, allowing a comparison with the original machine. Economic aspects involved in the manufacturing of the new components were also critically evaluated...|$|E

40|$|SummaryIschemia-associated {{oxidative}} damage leading to necrosis {{is a major}} cause of catastrophic tissue loss, and elucidating its signaling mechanism is therefore of paramount importance. p 53 is a central stress sensor responding to multiple insults, including oxidative stress to orchestrate apoptotic and autophagic cell death. Whether p 53 can also activate oxidative stress-induced necrosis is, however, unknown. Here, we uncover a role for p 53  in activating necrosis. In response to oxidative stress, p 53 accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix and triggers mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) opening and necrosis by physical interaction with the PTP regulator cyclophilin D (CypD). Intriguingly, a robust p 53 -CypD complex forms during brain ischemia/reperfusion injury. In contrast, reduction of p 53 levels or cyclosporine A pretreatment of mice prevents this complex and is associated with effective stroke protection. Our study identifies the mitochondrial p 53 -CypD axis as an important contributor to oxidative stress-induced necrosis and implicates this <b>axis</b> in <b>stroke</b> pathology...|$|R
50|$|Streamline {{position}} is mostly {{used at the}} start of the race once a swimmer dives into the water off of the blocks. It is most common for the swimmer to dive into the water head first with their arms above their head and assume the streamline form at entry. The other common occurrence of streamline in a competitive race is after a swimmer completes a flip turn and pushes off of the wall. Once they have completely turned over to the opposing direction, the swimmer will then get into streamline position and push off of the wall to maximize the distance and speed out of the turn. Streamline {{position is}} the basis of the spinal <b>axis</b> <b>strokes,</b> backstroke and freestyle, as well. A swimmer will try to maintain a straight back and legs to minimize drag during the stroke. The Fédération Internationale de Natation (F.I.N.A.), otherwise known as the International Swimming Federation, has strict rules on how and when streamline may be performed in competition. According to FINA, no swimmer may travel more than 15 meters (16.4 yards) off of a start or turn in the backstroke, butterfly and freestyle underwater. Breaststroke is only allowed one complete arm stroke followed by a butterfly kick and breaststroke kick. After fifteen meters, the swimmer must break the surface of the water. Streamline is to only be used in the first 15 meters due to the swimmers inability to remain underwater without disqualification. This rule applies to all races done in compliance with FINA rules whether it is short course or long course. Swimmers in a race will usually maintain the streamline form and perform a butterfly kick for the full fifteen meters due to the fact that there is less resistance than there is on top of the water due to the lack of drag created by waves. There is no specified limit in this stroke, but, since the number of underwater strokes and kicks are regulated, this becomes a moot point to competitive swimming. It is not hydrodynamic to maintain this position past a certain distance, which is invariably less than the length of a short-course pool.|$|R

5000|$|Pneumatic drills were {{developed}} {{in response to the}} needs of mining, quarrying, excavating, and tunneling. In 1806 Samuel Miller invented a steam driven percussion drill. In 1838 Isaac Singer invented another steam driven drill. A pneumatic drill was proposed by a C. Brunton in 1844. [...] The first [...] "percussion drill" [...] was made in 1848 and patented in 1849 by Jonathan J. Couch of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. [...] In this drill, the drill bit passed through the piston of a steam engine. The piston snagged the drill bit and hurled it against the rock face. It was an experimental model. In 1849, Couch's assistant, Joseph W. Fowle, filed a patent caveat for a percussion drill of his own design. In Fowle’s drill, the drill bit was connected directly to the piston in the steam cylinder; specifically, the drill bit was connected to the piston’s crosshead. The drill also had a mechanism for turning the drill bit around its <b>axis</b> between <b>strokes</b> and for advancing the drill as the hole deepened. [...] By 1850 or 1851, Fowle was using compressed air to drive his drill, making it the first true pneumatic drill.|$|R
40|$|Stroke is a {{major cause}} of {{mortality}} and disability worldwide. The main cause of stroke is atherosclerosis, and the most common risk factor for atherosclerosis is hypertension. Therefore, antihypertensive treatments are recommended for the prevention of stroke. Three angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), telmisartan, irbesartan and candesartan, inhibit the expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), {{which is one of the}} pleiotropic effects of these drugs. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB 1) is the ligand of RAGE, and has been recently identified as a lethal mediator of severe sepsis. HMGB 1 is an intracellular protein, which acts as an inflammatory cytokine when released into the extracellular milieu. Extracellular HMGB 1 causes multiple organ failure and contributes to the pathogenesis of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and stroke. This is the first review of the literature evaluating the potential of three ARBs for the HMGB 1 -RAGE <b>axis</b> on <b>stroke</b> therapy, including prevention and acute treatment. This review covers clinical and experimental studies conducted between 1976 and 2013.

40|$|Chronic {{stress is}} capable of {{exacerbating}} each major, modifiable, endogenous risk factor for cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease. Indeed, exposure to stress can increase both the incidence and severity of stroke, presumably through activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Now that characterization of the mechanisms underlying epigenetic programming of the HPA axis is well underway, there has been renewed interest in examining the role of early environment {{on the evolution of}} health conditions across the entire lifespan. Indeed, neonatal manipulations in rodents that reduce stress responsivity, and subsequent life-time exposure to glucocorticoids, are associated with a reduction in the development of neuroendocrine, neuroanatomical, and cognitive dysfunctions that typically progress with age. Although improved day to day regulation of the HPA axis also may be accompanied by a decrease in stroke risk, evidence from rodent studies suggest that an associated cost could be increased susceptibility to inflammation and neuronal death in the event that a stroke does occur and the individual is exposed to persistently elevated corticosteroids. Given its importance in regulation of health and disease states, any long-term modulation of the HPA axis is likely to be associated with both benefits and potential risks. The goals of this review article are to examine (1) the clinical and experimental data suggesting that neonatal experiences can shape HPA axis regulation, (2) the influence of stress and the HPA <b>axis</b> on <b>stroke</b> incidence and severity, and (3) the potential for neonatal programming of the HPA axis to impact adult cerebrovascular health...|$|R

40|$|Stroke is {{a leading}} cause of death and {{long-term}} disability worldwide. Ischaemic stroke is caused by a blood clot that obstructs cerebral blood flow. Current treatment mainly consists of achieving fast reperfusion, either via pharmacological thrombolysis using tissue plasminogen activator or via endovascular thrombectomy. Unfortunately, reperfusion therapy is only available to a limited group of patients and reperfusion injury can further aggravate brain damage. Hence, there is an urgent need for better understanding of ischaemic stroke pathophysiology in order to develop novel therapeutic strategies. In recent years, the pathophysiological importance of von Willebrand factor (VWF) in ischaemic stroke has become clear from both clinical and experimental studies. In particular, binding of VWF to platelet glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) has become an interesting target for ischaemic stroke therapy. Recent insights show that inhibting the VWF-GPIb interaction could result in a pro-thrombolytic activity improving cerebral reperfusion rates and concurrently reducing cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion damage.

40|$|Background: With {{the advent}} of novel brain {{stimulation}} techniques aimed at improving functional outcome, understanding poststroke plasticity becomes critical for the appropriate selection of patients and optimal timing to introduce neuromodulatory interventions. Objective. To better define the temporal evolution of central and peripheral neuroplastic changes in the first 3 months after stroke and their clinical implications. Methods: Transcranial magnetic stimulation, peripheral nerve excitability, and clinical assessments were undertaken longitudinally in 31 acute stroke patients, comprising a total of 384 clinical studies. Results: During the hyperacute phase (< 7 days), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) was significantly reduced in lesioned (4. 3 % ± 1. 3 %) and contralesional hemispheres (3. 6 % ± 1. 9 %) compared with controls (11. 4 % ± 1. 3 %, P =. 001). There were also significant alterations in accommodative properties of motor axons in the affected limb.

40|$|Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) plays a {{major role}} in {{thrombosis}} and hemostasis and its thrombogenicity is controlled by ADAMTS 13. Whereas increasing evidence shows a clear association between VWF levels and acute ischemic stroke, little is known about a correlation with ADAMTS 13. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare plasma levels of ADAMTS 13 between 85 healthy volunteers (HV), 104 patients with acute ischemic stroke and 112 patients with a chronic cerebrovascular disease (CCD). In this case-control study, plasma ADAMTS 13 antigen levels were measured by ELISA and plasma VWF levels, measured previously, were next used to calculate VWF:ADAMTS 13 ratios. ADAMTS 13 levels and VWF:ADAMTS 13 ratios were subsequently correlated with key demographic and clinical parameters. ADAMTS 13 levels were significantly lower in acute ischemic stroke patients (82. 6 ± 21. 0 %) compared with HV (110. 6 ± 26. 9 %). Also, CCD patients (99. 6 ± 24. 5 %) had significantly lower ADAMTS 13 levels compared with HV however these were still higher than in acute stroke patients. Furthermore, when assessing the VWF:ADAMTS 13 ratios, an even greater difference was revealed between stroke patients (2. 7 ± 1. 9), HV (1. 1 ± 0. 5) and CCD patients (1. 7 ± 0. 7). The VWF:ADAMTS 13 ratio was significantly associated with stroke severity and modality. In conclusion, both in acute and chronic cerebrovascular disease patients, ADAMTS 13 levels were significantly decreased, with the lowest ADAMTS 13 levels found in acute stroke patients. This difference was even more distinct when the ratio of VWF:ADAMTS 13 was considered.

40|$|AbstractObjective. Our aim was {{to select}} a method of {{analysis}} for gated blood pool tomography that reduced variability {{in a group of}} normal subjects, allowed comparison with normal limit files and displayed results in the bull's-eye format. Background. Abnormalities in left ventricular function may not be accurately detected by measures of global function because hyperkuiesia in normal regions may compensate for abnormal regional function. Gated blood pool tomography acquires threedimensional data and offers advantages over other noninvasive modalities Tor quantitative assessment of global and regional function. Methods. Alternative methods for selecting the ventricular axis, calculating regional ejection fraction and choosing the number of ventricular divisions were studied In 15 normal volunteers to select the combination of parameter that produced the lowest variability in quantitative regional ejection fraction. Methods for quantitative comparison, of regional ejection fraction with normal limit files and for display in the bull's-eye format were also examined. Results. A fixed axis (the geometric center of the ventricle defined for end-diastole and used for end-systole) gave ejection fractions that were significantly higher in the lateral wall versus in the septum, 82 ± 8 (mean ± 1 SD) versus 39 ± 17 (p 2. 5 SD below the mean as abnormal. We described the two-dimensional bull's-eye format as a method for displaying the regional three-dimensional data and illustrated abnormalities in patients with prior myocardial infarction.

However, {{little is known}} about the neural correlates of anhedonia in stroke patients. In this study, we investigated the association of post-stroke anhedonia with salivary cortisol levels and stroke location and volume. Patients and methods: A psychiatrist administered the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition to identify anhedonia in 36 inpatients, without previous depression, consecutively admitted in a neurology clinic in the first month after a first-ever ischemic stroke. Salivary cortisol levels were assessed in the morning, evening, and after a dexamethasone suppression test. We used magnetic resonance imaging and a semi-automated brain morphometry method to assess stroke location, and the MRIcro program according to the Brodmann Map to calculate the lesion volume. Results: Patients with anhedonia had significantly larger diurnal variation (P-value = 0. 017) and higher morning levels of salivary cortisol (1, 671. 9 ± 604. 0 ng/dL versus 1, 103. 9 ± 821. 9  ng/dL; P-value = 0. 022), and greater stroke lesions in the parahippocampal gyrus (Brodmann area  36) compared to those without anhedonia (10. 14 voxels; standard deviation ± 17. 72 versus 0. 86  voxels; standard deviation ± 4. 64; P-value = 0. 027). The volume of lesion in the parahippocampal gyrus (Brodmann area 36) was associated with diurnal variation of salivary cortisol levels (rho= 0. 845; P-value = 0. 034) only in anhedonic patients.

40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus {{is a major}} risk factor for ischemic stroke. Also diabetes is associated with poor outcome after stroke. Underlying mechanisms are however not fully understood. Alteration in {{the expression of the}} SDF- 1 a/CXCR 4 axis, which is important for ischemic tissue repair, can be a probable cause. In this study, we have determined the expression of SDF- 1 a/CXCR 4 in the brains of type II diabetic mice at basal and in response to ischemic stroke and have investigated a method for overexpression of SDF- 1 a in the brains of the diabetic mice. Adult male C 57 BLKS/J mice (db/db) of age 8 weeks were used as the murine model for type II diabetes and their age matched lean littermates served as controls (db/+). Microvascular density was first determined in the cerebral cortex of db/db diabetic mice by immunohistochemical analysis. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion surgery (MCAO) in type 2 diabetic db/db mice and their controls. 48 hours after surgery, volume of ischemic damage was determined by TTC staining. The expression of SDF- 1 a and CXCR 4 in the ischemic and non ischemic sides of brains of both the groups were determined using western blot and real time RT PCR. The db/db diabetic mice were injected with the vector, adeno associated virus 9 (AAV-SDF- 1 a) in the brain striatum and the overexpression of SDF- 1 a was determined by immunohistochemical analysis. Double immunohistochemistry was used to determine the localization of SDF- 1 a in brain after injection of the vector. The microvascular density in the cerebral cortex was reduced in db/db mice as compared with db/+ mice (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Volume of ischemic damage was significantly increased in db/db mice after focal cerebral ischemia (p 3 ̆c 0. 01). The levels of SDF- 1 a expression in both ischemic and non ischemic side of brain were reduced in db/db mice as compared with those in db/+ mice at mRNA (p 3 ̆c 0. 01) and protein level (p 3 ̆c 0. 01). The amount of CXCR 4 expression was significantly reduced only in the ischemic side of the brains of db/db mice at protein level (p= 0. 001) and at m-RNA level (p= 0. 001). But in the non ischemic side, the expression of CXCR 4 did not show any significant difference between the two groups. Immunohistochemical analysis showed overexpression of SDF- 1 a in the striatum receiving the microinjection of AAV-SDF- 1 a and double immunohistochemistry showed SDF- 1 a to be localized in the glial cells of the cerebral striatum after microinjection. The results indicate that microvascular density is reduced and ischemia induced cerebral damage is enlarged in diabetes which may be linked to the impaired expression of hypoxia regulated SDF- 1 a/CXCR 4 <b>axis</b> after ischemic <b>stroke</b> in diabetes and vector mediated over expression of SDF- 1 a in the brain can be a novel therapeutic technique for treating ischemic stroke in diabetics...|$|R
