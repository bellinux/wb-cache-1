5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1346, Kantakouzenos stood {{on the verge of}} victory. He left Thrace under the control of his son Matthew and moved on to Selymbria, close to Constantinople. He did not attack the capital, but waited for almost <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> the city to surrender. In his memoirs, he {{explains}} {{that he did not want}} to turn his Turks on the city, although contemporaries such as Gregoras accused him of indecision and of needlessly prolonging the war.|$|E
5|$|Early in production, Warner Bros. {{decided to}} release Phantasm as a {{theatrical}} release, rather than straight to video. That left less than <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> production time (most animated features take well {{over two years}} from finished story to final release). Due to this decision, the animators went over the scenes {{in order to accommodate}} the widescreen theatrical aspect ratio. The studio cooperated well, granting the filmmakers a large amount of creative control.|$|E

A person who has 3 or more DUI convictions and a gap of less than 10 years since the last conviction incurs a fine of $1,000, 6 months imprisonment, a 10-year license suspension, an automobile insurance surcharge of $1,500 <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> 3 years, and installation of an ignition interlock device for 1 to 3 years after license restoration.

5|$|Having firmly {{assisted}} {{and supported}} {{her husband on}} his path to political greatness, she suddenly died in 1890, aged 39, leaving him, distraught and bereft of her support, to achieve the political destiny which she had plotted.

For the publishing of Wilson's autobiographic memoir , Landy stood to earn 30% of its proceeds.

The age of sexual maturity varies geographically and {{depends on the}} individual, as does the reproductive period.

The mating season lasts three to five months, but may last <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> older animals.|$|E

5|$|Because of Southern Rhodesia's {{small size}} {{and lack of}} major controversies, its unicameral {{parliament}} then sat only twice <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> <b>for</b> about three months in total, holding discussions in the afternoons {{either side of a}} half-hour break for tea on the lawn. Smith's early parliamentary commitments in Salisbury therefore did not detract greatly from his ranching. His maiden speech to the Legislative Assembly, in November 1948, concerned the Union of South Africa Trade Agreement Bill, then at its second reading. He was slow to make an impact in parliament—most of his early contributions related to farming and mining—but his exertions within the party won him Stockil's respect and confidence. Janet ran Gwenoro during Smith's absences, and gave birth to his only biological child, Alec, in Gwelo on 20 May 1949.|$|E

While training in the 2009 off-season, Hodgson suffered a back injury that required <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> him to fully recover. In 2010–11, he played his professional rookie season with the Canucks' minor league affiliate, the Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League (AHL). The season also marked his debut at the NHL level with the Canucks {{and he went on}} to participate in the team's run to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals. During his rookie season the subsequent year, Hodgson was dealt to the Buffalo Sabres at the 2012 trade deadline.|$|E
5|$|In 1702, King William III died, and Anne became Queen. Anne {{immediately}} offered John Churchill a dukedom, which Sarah initially refused.

Anne countered by offering the Marlboroughs a pension of £5000 <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> <b>for</b> life, from Parliament, as well as an extra £2000 a year from the Privy Purse, and they accepted the Dukedom. Sarah was promptly created Mistress of the Robes (the highest office in the royal court that could be held by a woman), Groom of the Stole, Keeper of the Privy Purse, and Ranger of Windsor Great Park.
