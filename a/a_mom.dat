Additionally, the song suggests the stalker is under the influence of drugs: It must be the weed, it must be the E / 'Cause you be poppin', heard you get it poppin'." [...] During the chorus, Carey confronts her stalker, asking: Why are you so obsessed with me / Boy I wanna know / Lying that you're sexing me / When everybody knows/ It's clear that you're upset with me / Oh, Oh, Oh, finally found a girl that you couldn't impress / last man on the earth still couldn't get this." [...] During the song's second verse, critics complimented Carey's lyrics, highlighting phrases such as: You're <b>a</b> <b>mom</b> & pop, I'm a corporation / I'm the press conference, you're a conversation", [...] "suggesting the rapper isn't a worthy suitor".|$|E

The A.V. Clubs Genevieve Koski commented that [...] "inane lyrical premises like those" [...] on the song [...] "are salvaged by the mightiest of hooks, pummeling the listener into lobotomized musical escapism". David Buchanan of Consequence of Sound said both [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] and [...] "I Wanna Go" [...] "brings Dirty Vegas memories, plus phoning in that Far East Movement 'Like a G6' backing track {{would have been}} put to better use with Spears' producers". Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times noted Spears [...] "drags her down low as if she's Rihanna" [...] in the song. MTV writer Eliot Glazer said that, [...] "even as <b>a</b> <b>mom</b> with two kids, Britney still manages to ooze sex appeal in [...] "Beautiful," [...] cementing her place as the world's number one MILF". Hannah Rishel of The Daily Collegian said [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] was [...] "possibly [...] favorite song on the album", commenting that [...] "it's cheesy and ridiculous, but Spears makes it work in the song". Following the release of Femme Fatale, [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] reached number forty-one on South Korea's Gaon International Chart, after selling 7,500 digital units of the song alone.
