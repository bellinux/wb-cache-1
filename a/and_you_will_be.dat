25|$|In 1901, Boyce {{successfully}} led {{a campaign}} to have the WFM adopt socialism as its official economic policy. An ardent socialist, Boyce famously declared:There can be no harmony between organized capitalists and organized labor. Our present wage system is slavery in its worst form. … Advise strikes as the weapon {{to be used by}} labor to obtain its rights, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> branded as criminals who aim to ruin the business interests of the country. Change from the policy of simple trades unionism that is fast waning, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> told that your action is premature, as this is not the time. Pursue the methods adopted by capitalists <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> sent to prison for robbery or executed for murder. Demand, and your demands will be construed into threats of violence against the rights of private property calculated to scare capital. Avail yourself of your constitutional rights and propose to take political action, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> charged with selling out the organization to some political party. Counsel arbitration, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> told that there is nothing to arbitrate. Be conservative, and your tameness will be construed as an appreciation of the conditions thrust upon you by trusts and syndicates. Take what action you will in the interests of labor, the trained beagles in the employ of capital from behind their loathsome fortress of disguised patriotism will howl their tirade of condemnation.|$|E
25|$|Bart D. Ehrman {{argues that}} {{different}} parts of the Bible give different answers. One example is evil as punishment for sin or as a consequence of sin. Ehrman writes that this seems to be based on some notion of free will although this argument is never explicitly mentioned in the Bible. Another argument is that suffering ultimately achieves a greater good, possibly for persons other than the sufferer, {{that would not have been}} possible otherwise. The Book of Job offers two different answers: suffering is a test, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> rewarded later for passing it; another that God in his might chooses not to reveal his reasons. Ecclesiastes sees suffering as beyond human abilities to comprehend. Apocalyptic parts, including the New Testament, see suffering as due to cosmic evil forces, that God for mysterious reasons has given power over the world, but which will soon be defeated and things will be set right.|$|E

500|$|Barr {{was posted}} to North Africa on 28September 1941, to fly with No.3 Squadron {{under the command}} of Squadron Leader Peter Jeffrey. He {{converted}} to P-40D Tomahawk fighters at an RAF operational training unit in Khartoum. There he also received his [...] "goolie chit", a piece of paper to be shown to local tribesmen in the event he was shot down, reading in Arabic: [...] "don't kill the bearer, feed him and protect him, take him to the English <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> rewarded. Peace be upon you." [...] Returning to North Africa, Barr achieved his first aerial victory, over a Messerschmitt Bf110, on 12December. He followed this up with a Junkers Ju88 and a Messerschmitt Bf109 the next day. The squadron then re-equipped with P-40E Kittyhawks; Barr was flying the new model when he became an ace on New Year's Day 1942, shooting down two Junkers Ju87 Stukas. On 8March, he led a flight of six Kittyhawks to intercept a raid on Tobruk by twelve Ju87s escorted by ten Macchi C.202s and two Bf109s. The Australians destroyed six Macchis and three Ju87s without loss, Barr personally accounting for one of the Macchis.|$|E

500|$|In the {{original}} pitch to overseas The Walt Disney Company executives, Povenmire and Marsh constructed storyboards and recorded them with dialogue and sound-effects. As a prototype, Ferb {{did not speak}} at all. However, after considering comedy's [...] "big duos" [...] including Wallace and Gromit and Jay and Silent Bob, the creators chose to have Ferb speak {{at least once in}} most episodes (but in [...] "Summer Belongs To You" [...] he spoke nine times and in [...] "The Lizard Whisperer" [...] gives an entire short speech that lasts about 45 seconds), but to have him remain silent and allow Phineas to speak for him the majority of the time. Although Ferb's taciturnity is generally not commented on in the series, Phineas mentions it while he and his brother were in England on the episode [...] "A Hard Day's Knight": [...] "I'll be the top half since I tend to do more of the talking <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> on the bottom part because of your long spindely legs". Despite being quiet, Ferb is a polyglot, being able to speak in human, animal, and alien tongues.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers have praised Super Punch-Out!! for {{its other}} unique {{features}} {{and for its}} rewarding difficulty. Game Informer magazine praised the game for its time attack mode, which recorded and kept track of the fastest knockouts for each opponent. Miller also commended the time attack mode, adding to the game's replay value. Another review from VideoGames & Computer Entertainment magazine lauded the game for a fair difficulty curve, stating that it [...] "is a really tough game, but it's one in which repeated playing (<b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> playing it a lot) really pays off". Lucas Thomas from IGN, while praising the game overall, says that the game lacks the overall appeal that the NES version had and that he recommends the NES version over this version. He notes that the sound is [...] "Not as memorable as the music from the NES game, but [...] more varied". He says that {{many people who are}} familiar with the NES version have to relearn new attack patterns from different opponents. Thomas also notes that the game did not have as large an audience as the NES version enjoyed.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} anti-apartheid protest music often used subversive {{meanings}} hidden under innocuous lyrics, partially {{as a consequence}} of the censorship that they experienced. Purely musical techniques were also used to convey meaning. The tendency to use hidden meaning increased as the government grew less tolerant from the 1950s to the 1980s. Popular protest songs of the 1950s often directly addressed politicians. [...] "Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd" [...] by Mini told Hendrik Verwoerd to [...] "Naants'indod'emnyama, Verwoerd bhasobha" [...] (beware of the advancing blacks), while a song referring to pass laws in 1956 included the phrase [...] "Hey Strydom, Wathint'a bafazi, way ithint'imbodoko uzaKufa" [...] (Strydom, now that you have touched the women, you have struck a rock, you have dislodged a boulder, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> crushed). Following the Sharpeville massacre songs became less directly critical of the government, and more mournful. [...] "Thina Sizwe" [...] included references to stolen land, was described as depicting emotional desolation, while [...] "Senzeni Na" [...] (what have we done) achieved the same effect by repeating that phrase a number of times. Some musicians adapted innocuous popular tunes and modified their lyrics, thereby avoiding the censors. The Soweto uprising marked a turning point in the movement, as songs written in the 1980s again became more direct, with the appearance of musicians such as Lucey, who [...] "believed in an in‐your‐face, tell‐it‐like‐it‐is approach". Lyrics from this period included calls such as [...] "They are lying to themselves. Arresting us, killing us, won't work. We'll still fight for our land," [...] and [...] "The whites don't negotiate with us, so let's fight".|$|E
