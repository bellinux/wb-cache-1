Idolator also praised {{the use of the}} [...] "It's Britney, bitch" [...] line. Rebecca Macatee of E! Online wrote that the track is [...] "clubby, catchy, cool", and compared Spears' vocals to those of Madonna, and wrote about the use of pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune on the song. Bill Lamb of About.com wrote that [...] "the digital effects <b>are</b> <b>seamless</b> and the use of modulations of Britney Spears' voice to build the chorus sounds perfectly natural in this context", and that, [...] "the spacey, free form bridge is beautiful despite will.i.am's singing talent limitations." [...] A Rap-Up reviewer noted the use of Auto-Tune on will.i.am's vocals only.|$|E

50|$|Seam welding {{produces}} an extremely durable weld because the joint is forged {{due to the}} heat and pressure applied. A properly welded joint formed by resistance welding can easily be stronger than the material from which it is formed. A common use of seam welding is during the manufacture of round or rectangular steel tubing. Seam welding {{has been used to}} manufacture steel beverage cans but is no longer used for this as modern beverage cans <b>are</b> <b>seamless</b> aluminum.|$|E

The tubes are interconnected by {{different types of}} flanges (especially for the larger sizes and pressures), welding cones/nipples (with o-ring seal), several types of flare connection and by cut-rings. In larger sizes, hydraulic pipes are used. Direct joining of tubes by welding is not acceptable since the interior cannot be inspected.|$|E

5000|$|Kingsley’s work {{argues that}} the {{writings}} of the presocratic philosophers Parmenides and Empedocles, usually seen as rational or scientific enterprises, were in fact expressions of a wider Greek mystical tradition that helped give rise to western philosophy and civilisation. This tradition, according to Kingsley, was a way of life leading to the direct experience of reality and the recognition of one's divinity. Yet, as Kingsley stresses, this was no [...] "otherworldly" [...] mysticism: its chief figures were also lawgivers, diplomats, physicians, and even military men. The texts produced by this tradition <b>are</b> <b>seamless</b> fabrics of what later thought would distinguish as the separate areas of mysticism, science, healing, and art.|$|E
5000|$|Metal Hammer writer Rob Barbour {{claimed that}} [...] "While it's {{certainly}} no genrebusting reinvention, this record {{is still a}} stunning achievement, packed {{from start to finish}} with kaiju-sized choruses and without a single note out of place".

50|$|NomIg {{were among}} the first to create video {{paintings}} with their 2001 piece ‘Ad Infinitum’. Working as audiovisual artists, the NomIg. duo questioned what would happen if the concepts of Eno's ambient works were applied to the visual domain. As a result their works place paramount importance on fluidity of movement; an absence of direct cuts/edits; and the removal of a linear time experience for the viewer. Their video paintings are centered on near-imperceptible movement where the works cause the viewer to question whether there is any movement at all. Upon a passing glance the work appears to be still - it is only after a returning glance or concentrated awareness that the motion of the piece reveals itself. Their work takes a fleeting second and expands it into a timeless contemplation of the moment. To achieve their extreme slow motion NomIg. have heavily researched and developed editing techniques which layer and blend frames while not succumbing to the artifacts of the standard digital slow motion process (jerky movement, blurry content). The actual duration of their paintings often exceeds 3 hours and are regularly produced in 1080p HD format. They <b>are</b> <b>seamless</b> loops.|$|E
