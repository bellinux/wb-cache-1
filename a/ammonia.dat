5|$|<b>Ammonia</b> was {{tentatively}} detected on Mars by the Mars Express satellite, {{but with}} its relatively short lifetime, {{it is not}} clear what produced it. <b>Ammonia</b> is not stable in the Martian atmosphere and breaks down after a few hours. One possible source is volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|Because {{most of the}} {{pipeline}} was built above permafrost, each of the pipes holding up the raised sections of pipeline contained a sealed tube of <b>ammonia.</b> As the permafrost below {{the pipeline}} warms, the <b>ammonia</b> absorbs the heat and rises to a radiator {{on top of each}} stanchion. The <b>ammonia</b> is cooled by the outside air, condenses, and falls back {{to the bottom of the}} tube, where the process repeats.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} studies demonstrating {{the central role}} of <b>ammonia,</b> <b>ammonia</b> levels do not always correlate with the severity of the encephalopathy; it is suspected that this means that more <b>ammonia</b> has already been absorbed into the brain in those with severe symptoms whose serum levels are relatively low. Other waste products implicated in hepatic encephalopathy include mercaptans (substances containing a thiol group), short-chain fatty acids, and phenol.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{recently}} discovered archaeal involvement in <b>ammonia</b> oxidation reactions. These reactions {{are particularly important}} in the oceans. The archaea also appear crucial for <b>ammonia</b> oxidation in soils. They produce nitrite, which other microbes then oxidize to nitrate. Plants and other organisms consume the latter.|$|E
5|$|Spectroscopic {{observers}} {{found that}} <b>ammonia</b> and carbon disulfide persisted {{in the atmosphere}} for at least fourteen months after the collisions, with {{a considerable amount of}} <b>ammonia</b> being present in the stratosphere as opposed to its normal location in the troposphere.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, an {{alternative}} transferase mechanism has been evolved by amidophosphoribosyltransferases, which has two active sites. In the first active site, a cysteine triad hydrolyses a glutamine substrate to release free <b>ammonia.</b> The <b>ammonia</b> then diffuses though an internal tunnel in the enzyme {{to the second}} active site, where it is transferred to a second substrate.|$|E
5|$|Barium {{reacts with}} <b>ammonia</b> to form {{complexes}} such as Ba(NH3)6.|$|E
5|$|Charles Lieber and Andre Lefèvre {{discover}} that antibiotics reduce gastric urea to <b>ammonia</b> conversion.|$|E
5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{can occur}} in those with acute or chronic liver disease. Episodes can be triggered by infections, GI bleeding, constipation, electrolyte problems, or certain medications. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve the build up of <b>ammonia</b> in the blood, a substance that is normally removed by the liver. The diagnosis is typically made after ruling out other potential causes. It may be supported by blood <b>ammonia</b> levels, an electroencephalogram, or a CT scan of the brain.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{observed}} 4.7 gigawatts heat flux {{is enough to}} power the cryovolcanism without the presence of <b>ammonia.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Rupert Wildt {{identified}} {{absorption bands}} of <b>ammonia</b> and methane in the spectra of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009 it was {{announced}} that traces of <b>ammonia</b> had been found in the plumes during flybys in July and October 2008. Reducing the freezing point of water with <b>ammonia</b> would also allow for outgassing and higher gas pressure, and less heat required to power the water plumes. The subsurface layer heating the surface water ice could be an ammonia–water slurry at temperatures as low as , and thus less energy is required to produce the plume activity.|$|E
5|$|Lieber and Lefèvre {{publish a}} {{follow-up}} study demonstrating that antibiotics prevent {{the conversion of}} urea to <b>ammonia</b> in the human stomach.|$|E
5|$|Many other binary {{nitrogen}} hydrides are known, but {{the most}} important are hydrazine (N2H4) and hydrogen azide (HN3). Although it is not a nitrogen hydride, hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is similar in properties and structure to <b>ammonia</b> and hydrazine as well. Hydrazine is a fuming, colourless liquid that smells similarly to <b>ammonia.</b> Its physical properties are very similar to those of water (melting point 2.0°C, boiling point 113.5°C, density 1.00g·cm−3). Despite it being an endothermic compound, it is kinetically stable. It burns quickly and completely in air very exothermically to give nitrogen and water vapour. It is a very useful and versatile reducing agent and is a weaker base than <b>ammonia.</b> It is also commonly used as a rocket fuel.|$|E
5|$|Nutrients are transported {{throughout}} the coelom, including the mantle lobes, by cilia. The wastes produced by metabolism are broken into <b>ammonia,</b> which is eliminated by diffusion through the mantle and lophophore. Brachiopods have metanephridia, {{used by many}} phyla to excrete <b>ammonia</b> and other dissolved wastes. However, brachiopods have {{no sign of the}} podocytes, which perform the first phase of excretion in this process, and brachiopod metanephridia appear to be used only to emit sperm and ova.|$|E
5|$|Several methods {{exist to}} {{synthesize}} amino acids. One {{of the oldest}} methods begins with the bromination at the α-carbon of a carboxylic acid. Nucleophilic substitution with <b>ammonia</b> then converts the alkyl bromide to the amino acid. In alternative fashion, the Strecker amino acid synthesis involves the treatment of an aldehyde with potassium cyanide and <b>ammonia,</b> this produces an α-amino nitrile as an intermediate. Hydrolysis of the nitrile in acid then yields a α-amino acid. Using <b>ammonia</b> or ammonium salts in this reaction gives unsubstituted amino acids, whereas substituting primary and secondary amines will yield substituted amino acids. Likewise, using ketones, instead of aldehydes, gives α,α-disubstituted amino acids. The classical synthesis gives racemic mixtures of α-amino acids as products, but several alternative procedures using asymmetric auxiliaries or asymmetric catalysts have been developed.|$|E
5|$|The initial accretional heating {{together}} with continued decay of radioactive elements {{may have led}} to melting of the ice if an antifreeze like <b>ammonia</b> (in the form of <b>ammonia</b> hydrate) or some salt was present. The melting {{may have led to}} the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water (ocean) rich in dissolved <b>ammonia</b> may have formed at the core–mantle boundary. The eutectic temperature of this mixture is 176K. The ocean, however, is likely to have frozen long ago. Among Uranian moons Umbriel was least subjected to endogenic resurfacing processes, although it may like other Uranian moons have experienced a very early resurfacing event.|$|E
5|$|The initial accretional heating {{together}} with continued decay of radioactive elements were probably {{strong enough to}} melt the ice if some antifreeze like <b>ammonia</b> (in the form of <b>ammonia</b> hydrate) or some salt was present. Further melting {{may have led to}} the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water ('ocean') rich in dissolved <b>ammonia</b> may have formed at the core–mantle boundary. The eutectic temperature of this mixture is 176K. If the temperature dropped below this value the ocean would have frozen by now. Freezing of the water would have led to expansion of the interior, which may have also contributed to the formation of canyon-like graben. Still, present knowledge of the evolution of Oberon is very limited.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovered}} beef {{material is}} extruded through long tubes that are thinner than a pencil, {{during which time}} at the Beef Products, Inc. (BPI) processing plant, the meat is exposed to gaseous <b>ammonia.</b> At Cargill Meat Solutions, citric acid is used to kill bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella. Gaseous <b>ammonia</b> {{in contact with the}} water in the meat produces ammonium hydroxide. The <b>ammonia</b> sharply increases the pH and damages microscopic organisms, the freezing causes ice crystals to form and puncture the organisms' weakened cell walls, and the mechanical stress destroys the organisms altogether. The product is finely ground, compressed into pellets or blocks, flash frozen and then shipped for use as an additive.|$|E
5|$|Trace {{amounts of}} <b>ammonia,</b> acetylene, ethane, propane, {{phosphine}} and methane {{have been detected}} in Saturn's atmosphere. The upper clouds are composed of <b>ammonia</b> crystals, while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH) or water. Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes methane photolysis in the upper atmosphere, leading {{to a series of}} hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by eddies and diffusion. This photochemical cycle is modulated by Saturn's annual seasonal cycle.|$|E
5|$|A drop of dilute <b>ammonia</b> (as a 12% NH4OH solution) {{placed on}} the cap surface {{immediately}} turns dark red. If {{placed on the}} bulbous part of the stem base of a dried specimen, it will turn dark for roughly 15 seconds before starting to fade.|$|E
5|$|A {{preparation}} of L-ornithine and L-aspartate (LOLA) {{is used to}} increase the generation of urea through the urea cycle, a metabolic pathway that removes <b>ammonia</b> by turning it into the neutral substance urea. It may be combined with lactulose and/or rifaximin if these alone are ineffective at controlling symptoms.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} aquatic animals, most fish release their {{nitrogenous}} wastes as <b>ammonia.</b> Some of the wastes diffuse through the gills. Blood wastes are filtered by the kidneys.|$|E
5|$|Because no <b>ammonia</b> was {{initially}} {{found in the}} vented material by INMS or UVIS, which could act as an antifreeze, it was thought such a heated, pressurized chamber would consist of nearly pure liquid water with a temperature of at least , because pure water requires more energy to melt.|$|E
5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{is possibly}} reversible with treatment. This typically involves supportive care and addressing the triggers of the event. Lactulose is frequently used to decrease <b>ammonia</b> levels. Certain antibiotics and probiotics are other potential options. A liver transplant may improve outcomes {{in those with}} severe disease.|$|E
5|$|Horseshoe crabs convert {{nitrogenous}} wastes to <b>ammonia</b> {{and dump}} it via their gills, and excrete other wastes as feces via the anus. They also have nephridia ("little kidneys"), which extract other wastes for excretion as urine. <b>Ammonia</b> is so toxic {{that it must}} be diluted rapidly with large quantities of water. Most terrestrial chelicerates cannot afford to use so much water and therefore convert nitrogenous wastes to other chemicals, which they excrete as dry matter. Extraction is by various combinations of nephridia and Malpighian tubules. The tubules filter wastes out of the blood and dump them into the hindgut as solids, a system that has evolved independently in insects and several groups of arachnids.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen is {{sometimes}} produced and {{consumed in the}} same industrial process, without being separated. In the Haber process {{for the production of}} <b>ammonia,</b> hydrogen is generated from natural gas. Electrolysis of brine to yield chlorine also produces hydrogen as a co-product.|$|E
5|$|Ice giants, Uranus and Neptune, are {{primarily}} composed of low-boiling-point {{materials such as}} water, methane, and <b>ammonia,</b> with thick atmospheres of hydrogen and helium. They have a significantly lower mass than the gas giants (only 14 and 17 Earth masses).|$|E
5|$|If early {{tetrapods}} {{lived in}} freshwater, {{and if they}} {{lost the ability to}} produce urea and used <b>ammonia</b> only, they would have to evolve it from scratch again later. Not a single species of all the ray-finned fishes living today has been able to do that, so it is not likely the tetrapods would have done so either. Terrestrial animals that can only produce <b>ammonia</b> would have to drink constantly, making a life on land impossible (a few exceptions exist, as some terrestrial woodlice can excrete their nitrogenous waste as <b>ammonia</b> gas). This probably also was a problem at the start when the tetrapods started to spend time out of water, but eventually the urea system would dominate completely. Because of this it is not likely they emerged in freshwater (unless they first migrated into freshwater habitats and then migrated onto land so shortly after that they still retained the ability to make urea), although some species never left, or returned to, the water could of course have adapted to freshwater lakes and rivers.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to bony fish, {{with the exception}} of the coelacanth, the blood and other tissue of sharks and Chondrichthyes is generally isotonic to their marine environments because of the high concentration of urea (up to 2.5%) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), allowing them to be in osmotic balance with the seawater. This adaptation prevents most sharks from surviving in freshwater, and they are therefore confined to marine environments. A few exceptions exist, such as the bull shark, which has developed a way to change its kidney function to excrete large amounts of urea. When a shark dies, the urea is broken down to <b>ammonia</b> by bacteria, causing the dead body to gradually smell strongly of <b>ammonia.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the home, {{accidents}} {{occur when}} hypochlorite bleach solutions {{come into contact}} with certain acidic drain-cleaners to produce chlorine gas. Hypochlorite bleach (a popular laundry additive) combined with <b>ammonia</b> (another popular laundry additive) produces chloramines, another toxic group of chemicals.|$|E
5|$|Indigestible {{remains of}} prey are {{expelled}} through the mouth. The main waste product of cells' internal processes is <b>ammonia,</b> which is removed by the {{external and internal}} water currents.|$|E
5|$|Iridium {{is a good}} {{catalyst}} for the decomposition of hydrazine (into hot nitrogen and <b>ammonia),</b> and this is used in practice in low-thrust rocket engines; there are more details in the monopropellant rocket article.|$|E
5|$|Lactulose and {{lactitol}} are disaccharides {{that are}} not absorbed from the digestive tract. They are thought to decrease the generation of <b>ammonia</b> by bacteria, render the <b>ammonia</b> inabsorbable by converting it to ammonium (NH4+) ions, and increase transit of bowel content through the gut. Doses of 15-30ml are administered three times a day; the result is aimed to be 3–5 soft stools a day, or (in some settings) a stool pH of <6.0. Lactulose may also be given by enema, especially if encephalopathy is severe. More commonly, phosphate enemas are used. This may relieve constipation, one {{of the causes of}} encephalopathy, and increase bowel transit.|$|E
5|$|Like other reptiles, dinosaurs are {{primarily}} uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous wastes from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or <b>ammonia</b> via the ureters into the intestine. In most living species, uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, {{at least some}} modern birds (such as hummingbirds) can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as <b>ammonia.</b> They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, {{as well as the}} output of the intestines, emerges from the cloaca. In addition, many species regurgitate pellets, and fossil pellets that may have come from dinosaurs are known from as long ago as the Cretaceous period.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} alkali metals, sodium dissolves in <b>ammonia</b> and some amines to give deeply colored solutions; {{evaporation}} of these solutions leaves a shiny film of metallic sodium. The solutions contain the coordination complex (Na(NH3)6)+, with the positive charge counterbalanced by electrons as anions; cryptands permit {{the isolation of}} these complexes as crystalline solids. Sodium forms complexes with crown ethers, cryptands and other ligands. For example, 15-crown-5 has high affinity for sodium because the cavity size of 15-crown-5 is 1.7–2.2Å, which is enough to fit sodium ion (1.9Å). Cryptands, like crown ethers and other ionophores, also have a high affinity for the sodium ion; derivatives of the alkalide Na− are obtainable)|date=1974|volume=96|issue=2|pages=608–609|doi=10.1021/ja00809a060}} {{by the addition of}} cryptands to solutions of sodium in <b>ammonia</b> via disproportionation.|$|E
