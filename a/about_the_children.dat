5|$|By mid-1942, over 1,000 {{children}} {{that had been}} rounded up during the Kozara Offensive were being held at the Stara Gradiška concentration camp, itself a sub-camp of the Jasenovac concentration camp complex. Information {{about the plight of}} these children was passed to concerned citizens in the NDH capital, Zagreb, one of whom was Diana Budisavljević, an Austrian. Budisavljević approached an Ustaše-appointed {{member of the board of}} the Croatian Red Cross, Kamilo Brosler, and told him <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> at Stara Gradiška. Brosler was horrified, and with the support of representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross began to place pressure on the NDH government to release the children. Budisavljević also used her contacts with the German Army to intervene with the Ustaše regime on behalf of the children.|$|E

[...] Author Ron Ramdin wrote [...] "King faced many new and trying moments, his refuge was home and closeness to Coretta, whose calm and soothing voice whenever she sang, gave him renewed strength. She was the rock upon which his marriage and civil rights leadership, especially at this time of crisis, was founded." [...] After she succeeded in getting Martin Luther King, Jr. Day made a federal holiday, King said her husband's dream was [...] "for people of all religions, all socio-economic levels and all cultures to create a world community free from violence, poverty, racism and war so that they could live together in what he called the beloved community or his world house concept." ...|$|E
