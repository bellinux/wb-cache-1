The illuminated reticle was eventually replaced by a video screen at {{the focus of the}} collimating optics that not only gave a sighting point and information from a lead-finding computer and radar, but also various aircraft indicators (such as an artificial horizon, compass, altitude and <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators),</b> facilitating the visual tracking of targets or the transition from instrument to visual methods during landings.|$|E
5|$|Like most flight {{instructors}} giving dual instruction, Reid {{was seated}} on the right side, while the aircraft's primary flight instruments were mounted on the left, in front of Dubroff in this case. Investigators speculated {{that because of the}} heavy rain in his immediate climb path, Reid's forward visibility became greatly restricted. To maintain control through the climbing right turn, {{he would have had to}} turn his head to the left to see the flight instruments (most critically the attitude and <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators)</b> and to the right to see the ground through the side window. Such side-to-side head motion, combined with the worsening flight visibility during the climb and the reduced stall margin, could have led to spatial disorientation and loss of control.|$|E

25|$|Indicated {{airspeed}} (IAS) is the <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator</b> reading (ASIR) uncorrected for instrument, position, {{and other}} errors. From current EASA definitions: Indicated airspeed means {{the speed of}} an aircraft as shown on its pitot static <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator</b> calibrated to reflect standard atmosphere adiabatic compressible flow at sea level uncorrected for airspeed system errors.|$|R
25|$|Later {{the same}} year (1996), Aeroperú Flight 603, also {{operated}} with a Boeing 757, suffered a similar but far more difficult situation (static ports blocked by tape, rendering all <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators</b> and pressure altimeters unusable) and crashed in the ocean off Peru.|$|E
500|$|A blocked {{pitot tube}} is a pitot-static problem {{that will only}} affect <b>{{airspeed}}</b> <b>indicators.</b> [...] A blocked pitot tube will cause the airspeed indicator to register an increase in airspeed when the aircraft climbs, even though actual airspeed is constant.(As long as the drain hole is also blocked, as the air pressure would otherwise leak out to the atmosphere) [...] This {{is caused by the}} pressure in the pitot system remaining constant when the atmospheric pressure (and static pressure) are decreasing. [...] In reverse, the airspeed indicator will show a decrease in airspeed when the aircraft descends. [...] The pitot tube is susceptible to becoming clogged by ice, water, insects or some other obstruction. [...] For this reason, aviation regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recommend that the pitot tube be checked for obstructions prior to any flight. [...] To prevent icing, many pitot tubes are equipped with a heating element. [...] A heated pitot tube is required in all aircraft certificated for instrument flight except aircraft certificated as Experimental Amateur-Built.|$|E
500|$|Investigators {{identified}} {{evidence of}} arcing in wiring of the {{in-flight entertainment system}} network, but this did not trip the circuit breakers. [...] The investigation was unable to confirm if this arc was the [...] "lead event" [...] that ignited the flammable covering on MPET insulation blankets that quickly spread across other flammable materials. The crew did not recognize that a fire had started and were not warned by instruments. Once they {{became aware of the}} fire, the uncertainty of the problem made it difficult to address. The rapid spread of the fire led to the failure of key display systems, and the crew were soon rendered unable to control the aircraft. Because he had no light by which to see his controls after the displays failed, the pilot was forced to steer the plane blindly; intentionally or not, the plane swerved off course and headed back out into the Atlantic. Recovered fragments of the plane show that the heat inside the cockpit became so great that the ceiling started to melt. The recovered standby attitude indicator and <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators</b> showed that the aircraft struck the water at 300 knots (560km/h, 348mph) in a 20 degrees nose down and 110-degree bank attitude, or almost inverted; the impact force of the aircraft crashing into the Atlantic Ocean was later calculated to be 350 times the force of gravity ("g"s). Death was instantaneous for all passengers and crew due to the impact forces and deceleration.|$|E

50|$|In simple aircraft, {{without an}} air data {{computer}} or Machmeter, true airspeed can be calculated {{as a function of}} calibrated airspeed and local air density (or static air temperature and pressure altitude, which determine density). Some <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators</b> incorporate a slide rule mechanism to perform this calculation. Otherwise, it can be performed using this applet or a device such as the E6B (a handheld circular slide rule).|$|E

50|$|To {{maximize}} a pilot's {{understanding of}} how the hang glider is flying, most pilots carry instruments. The most basic being a variometer and altimeter—often combined. Some more advanced pilots also carry <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators</b> and radios. When flying in competition or cross country, pilots often also carry maps and/or GPS units. Hang gliders do not have instrument panels as such, so all the instruments are mounted to the control frame of the glider or occasionally strapped to the pilot's forearm.|$|E
