5|$|The Australian magpie prefers open <b>areas</b> <b>such</b> as grassland, {{fields and}} {{residential}} <b>areas</b> <b>such</b> as parks, gardens, golf courses, and streets, with scattered trees or forest nearby.

In general, evidence suggests the range and population of the Australian magpie has increased with land-clearing, although local declines in Queensland due to a 1902 drought, and in Tasmania in the 1930s have been noted; the cause for the latter is unclear but rabbit baiting, pine tree removal, and spread of the masked lapwing (Vanellus miles) have been implicated.|$|E
