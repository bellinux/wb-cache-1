5|$|After {{elections}} in 1884, a Catholic government under Jules Malou passed a new Education Law providing {{public financial support}} for religious schools. Religious education became compulsory in all schools in 1895. The Catholic Party's triumph in the issue was <b>another</b> <b>blow</b> to the already-weakened Liberal Party, and ushered {{in a period of}} almost unbroken Catholic government until World War II.|$|E
5|$|Serie A {{was dealt}} <b>another</b> <b>blow</b> by the 2006 Italian {{football}} scandal which involved alleged widespread match fixing implicating league champions Juventus, {{and other major}} teams including Milan, Fiorentina, Lazio, and Reggina. The FIGC ruled Juventus be stripped of their title, relegated to Serie B and start the following season with a nine-point deduction. The other clubs involved suffered similarly with relegation and points deduction.|$|E

5000|$|A {{year later}} {{he had another}} {{outburst}} umpire tirade, this time over a blown call double play against the Miami Marlins when Angel Hernandez called Alex Rios out at first base {{which would have been}} a walk off infield single for the White Sox. His reaction was, [...] "And <b>another</b> <b>blown</b> call by Hernandez!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Irish {{music hall}} historians Watters and Murtagh {{described}} Ashcroft's {{performance of the}} routine: [...] "Here 'McNamara' breaks into a dancing quick-step March {{up and down the}} Stage, his nimble fingers snatching up one instrument after <b>another,</b> <b>blowing</b> the bassoon, tootling the flute, beating the drum with the knob of his baton - A One-Man Band." ...|$|R
5|$|The commando's {{losses on}} Green Hill {{amounted}} to 80 men {{killed or wounded}} {{and as a result}} No. 6 Commando had to be reorganised into four troops instead of the six that its establishment called for. Shortly after this the unit suffered <b>another</b> <b>blow</b> when its commanding officer, Iain McAlpine, suffered heart trouble and had to be evacuated to hospital. In his place Major Jock MacLeod temporarily took over command.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>blow</b> to Soviet {{communism}} in the First World {{came with the}} establishment of eurocommunism. Eurocommunists espoused and supported the ideals of Soviet communism {{while at the same time}} supporting rights of the individual. The largest obstacle was that it was the largest communist parties, those with highest electoral turnout, which became eurocommunists. Originating with the Prague Spring, this new thinking made the First World more skeptical of Soviet {{communism in}} general. The Italian Communist Party notably declared that should war break out in Europe, they would rally to the defense of Italy and resist any Soviet incursion on their nation's soil.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, Banagher was {{the centre}} of a flourishing woollen trade. In 1699, the impost placed on the export of woollen goods to England {{practically}} killed the woollen trade. At {{the outbreak of the}} American Revolutionary War in 1775, an embargo placed on the export of foodstuffs to the American Colonies dealt <b>another</b> <b>blow</b> to the trade of Banagher. In 1780, the British Parliament withdrew all these restrictions and Banagher's economy began to improve rapidly.|$|E

5000|$|... 21 July 1979: <b>Another</b> <b>blown</b> tyre {{incident}} during takeoff from Dulles Airport. After {{that second}} incident the [...] "French {{director general of}} civil aviation issued an air worthiness directive and Air France issued a Technical Information Update, each calling for revised procedures. These included required inspection of each wheel and tyre for condition, pressure and temperature prior to each takeoff. In addition, crews were advised that landing gear should not be raised when a wheel/tyre problem is suspected." ...|$|R
5|$|In 1151, David again {{requested}} a pallium for the Archbishop of St Andrews. Cardinal John Paparo met David at his residence of Carlisle in September 1151. Tantalisingly for David, the Cardinal {{was on his}} way to Ireland with four pallia to create four new Irish archbishoprics. When the Cardinal returned to Carlisle, David made the request. In David's plan, the new archdiocese would include all the bishoprics in David's Scottish territory, as well as bishopric of Orkney and the bishopric of the Isles. Unfortunately for David, the Cardinal does not appear to have brought the issue up with the papacy. In the following year the papacy dealt David <b>another</b> <b>blow</b> by creating the archbishopric of Trondheim, a new Norwegian archbishopric embracing the bishoprics of the Isles and Orkney.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} round, Teixeira {{connected}} with a head kick for three points. He delivered <b>another</b> <b>blow</b> to Atias' head in the second round, bringing the score to 8:0. Atias' coach got the score adjusted to 7:0 after a discussion with the judges. Teixeira's success continued, scoring 16 total points {{by the end of}} the third round. Atias' only scored two points after being penalized for an illegal kick to the legs. Atias lost in the round of 16 against Venilton Teixeira from Brazil by point gap of 2–16. Atias would have had a chance to compete for the bronze medal if Teixeira reached the finals, however he failed to do so and therefore Atias was eliminated from competition.|$|E
5|$|The RLM {{considered}} {{setting up}} production facilities in Slovakia. But this would delay production until {{the buildings and}} factories could be furnished with the machine tools. These tools were also in short supply, and the RLM hoped to purchase them from Switzerland and Italy. The Slovaks could provide 3,500–4,000 workers, but no technical personnel. The move would only produce another 25 machines per month {{at a time when}} demand was increasing. In October, production plans were dealt <b>another</b> <b>blow</b> when one of WFGs plants burned down, leaving a chronic shortage of tailwheels and undercarriage parts. Junkers director and member of the Luftwaffe industry council Carl Frytag reported that by January 1943 only 120 Ju 87s could be produced at Bremen and 230 at Berlin-Tempelhof.|$|E
50|$|Johnson {{was then}} moved to Australia and was {{assigned}} to the 49th Fighter Group of the Fifth Air Force. During one mission, while piloting a P-38 Lightning, he and other aircraft from the 348th Fighter Group intercepted twenty Japanese aircraft. As they maneuvered into position, one of the aircraft in Johnson's formation could not drop its auxiliary fuel tanks, while <b>another</b> <b>blew</b> a supercharger. Unable to fight effectively, these aircraft were escorted back home, leaving Johnson and a few other aircraft alone.|$|R

5|$|If Mary was {{to secure}} England for Roman Catholicism, she needed an heir. On {{the advice of}} the Holy Roman Emperor she married his son, Philip II of Spain; she needed to prevent her Protestant {{half-sister}} Elizabeth from inheriting the Crown and thus returning England to Protestantism. There was opposition, and even a rebellion in Kent (led by Sir Thomas Wyatt); even though it was provided that Philip would never inherit the kingdom if there was no heir, received no estates and had no coronation. He was there to provide an heir. But she never became pregnant, and likely suffered from cancer. Ironically, <b>another</b> <b>blow</b> fell. Pope Julius died and his successor, Pope Paul IV, declared war on Philip and recalled Pole to Rome to have him tried as a heretic. Mary refused to let him go. The support she might have expected from a grateful Pope was thus denied.|$|E
5|$|In 1829, Duyet {{suffered}} <b>another</b> <b>blow</b> when Nguyen Van Thoai, an ally whom {{he appointed}} to run Cambodia for him died. The general nominated another subordinate to replace his colleague Nguyen Van Xuan, but Minh Mạng overruled him and instead appointed {{one of his}} mandarins Bui Minh Duc to the post. Although the emperor formally asked Duc to cooperate with Duyet, Minh Mạng then appointed Duc to the post of Minister of the Board of War, putting him above the general {{in the chain of}} command, effectively making Duyet irrelevant with regards to the running of the protectorate. In 1831, just before Duyet's death, Minh Mạng began to dismantle his military infrastructure and sending his component units to other parts of Vietnam, and sent a loyalist General Nguyen Van Khue to Gia Định, allowing him to dilute the viceroy's power. In addition, no government reports could be officially approved and sent to the capital until it was countersigned by civil officials sent south by the emperor. These moves against southern autonomy gradually increased the resentment and regionalist sentiments among the local population.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{continued}} loss {{of political}} strength as poor economic times continued, Macdonald planned {{to hold an}} election {{by the end of}} 1886, but had not yet issued the writ when an Ontario provincial election was called by Macdonald's former student, Liberal Ontario Premier Oliver Mowat. The provincial election was seen as a bellwether for the federal poll. Despite considerable campaigning by the Prime Minister, Mowat's Liberals were returned in Ontario, and increased their majority. Macdonald finally dissolved Parliament on 15 January 1887 for an election on 22 February. During the campaign, Macdonald suffered <b>another</b> <b>blow</b> when the Quebec provincial Liberals were able to form a government (four months after the October 1886 Quebec election), forcing the Conservatives from power in Quebec City. Nevertheless, Macdonald and his cabinet campaigned hard in the winter election, with Tupper (the new High Commissioner to London) postponing his departure to try to bolster Conservative hopes in Nova Scotia. The Liberal leader, Edward Blake, ran an uninspiring campaign, and the Conservatives were returned nationally with a majority of 35, winning easily in Ontario, Nova Scotia and Manitoba. The Tories even took a narrow majority of Quebec's seats despite resentment over Riel's hanging. Macdonald became MP for Kingston once again. Even the younger ministers, such as future Prime Minister John Thompson, who sometimes differed with Macdonald on policy, admitted the Prime Minister was an essential electoral asset for the Conservatives.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> major <b>blow</b> to O'Keefe was {{the sudden}} {{death of his}} partner and friend Lee Gordon, who died from a heart attack in London on 7 November 1963.|$|R
25|$|Midway {{through the}} second quarter, White, who had been held to {{negative}} passing yardage, finally got the Cowboys going on a 10-play, 68-yard drive, completing an 18-yard screen pass to Tony Dorsett and a 12-yarder to Drew Pearson before Dorsett wrapped {{it up with a}} 3-yard touchdown run to tie the game. The score would remain 7–7 at halftime, due to <b>another</b> <b>blown</b> scoring chance by the Eagles when Jaworski's touchdown pass to Harold Carmichael was canceled out by a 15-yard personal foul penalty on guard Woody Peoples.|$|R
60|$|Oswald {{tightened}} his grasp on his assailants, who were now striving to rise. There was <b>another</b> crashing <b>blow,</b> {{and then his}} last opponent slipped from his grasp, and fled.|$|R
5|$|The Assembly {{recessed}} on August 28 for the Labor Day holiday, and did {{not come}} back into session until September 4. The same day, Governor Stanley conferred with Rep. Smith, Delegate Gray, and House Speaker Moore. Their discussion focused on the Stanley plan's lack of an appeals process for pupil assignments. Stanley agreed to a compromise that would allow an administrative appeal (through an as-yet-to-be-worked-out process), followed by a required appeal to state courts and lower federal courts before any appeal could {{be taken to the}} U.S. Supreme Court. The Stanley plan seemed to suffer a serious blow the following day, however, when the Virginia State Board of Education voted not to endorse the plan. Four members strongly opposed withholding state funds from integrated schools, which led to the negative vote. The board also voted to publicly support the original Gray Commission plan. Meeting with the board after the vote, Governor Stanley discussed the possibility of merging his plan with some sort of pupil assignment plan, so that pupil assignment would be permitted but funds would still be withheld if assignment failed to segregate the schools. <b>Another</b> <b>blow</b> to the Stanley plan came when Colgate W. Darden, Jr., the former governor of Virginia who was now president of the University of Virginia, announced he opposed the Stanley plan and supported the Gray Commission's original proposals.|$|E
5|$|To {{make matters}} worse for Aberhart, Minister of Lands and Mines Charles Cathmer Ross {{resigned}} late in 1936, followed by Provincial Treasurer Charles Cockroft on January29, 1937. Neither minister's resignation was {{directly related to the}} dissidents' complaints: Ross resigned over disagreements with Aberhart on oil policy, while Cockroft left over a combination of ill health, clashes with Aberhart over the issue of a federal-provincial loan council, government investment policies, and Aberhart's approach to patronage. Nevertheless, the resignations were the public's first clue of dissent in Social Credit's ranks. Cockroft's resignation was followed by that of his deputy, J. F. Perceval, and there were rumours that Hugill and Minister of Agriculture and Trade and Industry William Chant would soon follow. This left Minister of Health Wallace Warren Cross, Minister of Public Works and Railways and Telephones William Fallow, and Provincial Secretary Ernest Manning as Aberhart's only indisputably loyal ministers, and Manning was away from the legislature, ill with tuberculosis. On February19, William Carlos Ives of the Supreme Court of Alberta dealt the government <b>another</b> <b>blow</b> when he struck down key provincial legislation, including one act reducing the interest paid on the province's bonds by half (though this was only a technical defeat, since the government had been defaulting on its bond payments since the previous April).|$|E
25|$|Decades later, in 1918, the {{neighborhood}} received <b>another</b> <b>blow</b> when St. John's Chapel was torn down.|$|E
5000|$|The scene {{depicting}} Christ Carrying the Cross {{is perhaps}} the most spectacular part of the Guimiliau calvary. Jesus carrying his cross does of course dominate the scene but the disposition and treatment of those forming the procession create a feeling of movement. The cortège is led by a cavalier on horseback and includes a soldier beating out a rhythm on a tambour and <b>another</b> <b>blowing</b> a trumpet. The soldier in front of Jesus leans maliciously on the cross to increase its weight. Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus to carry the cross and a second soldier is shown behind Jesus <b>blowing</b> <b>another</b> trumpet. Another sits with a shield and another carries a whip which he presses down on the cross which includes both patibulum and stipes. Note that the soldiers in this scene wear the military dress prevalent {{at the time of the}} Catholic League (French).|$|R
50|$|Added to that {{controversy}} {{the withdrawal}} of the hugely talented forward Tony Carmody from the panel {{in the middle of the}} national hurling league was <b>another</b> significant <b>blow</b> to the county team and its supporters.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some of us {{thought we}} felt a suck of air a quarter hour since, but we weren't sure; and then came <b>another,</b> which <b>blew</b> out the lights. Come along, lad; {{there is no time}} for talking." ...|$|R
25|$|On 26 October 1732 Zedler {{suffered}} <b>another</b> <b>blow.</b> Jacob August Franckenstein publicly {{announced that}} he would have no more to do with Zedler's publications.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>blow</b> was the {{construction}} of Interstate 4, which cut east-west across the approximate center of the neighborhood. Besides resulting in the demolition of even more homes and other structures, the highway cut most of the north-south routes through the area.|$|E
25|$|Then, in 1912, the Grand Trunk Pacific {{was dealt}} <b>another</b> <b>blow</b> when its general manager Charles Melville Hays {{died in the}} sinking of the Titanic. Despite these {{obstacles}} and tragedies, the railway was completed and the vision of Charles Hays was finally realized.|$|E
25|$|Hopkins {{complained of}} <b>another</b> low <b>blow</b> in the 11th round, {{but this time}} Cortez ignored his plea for time {{and told him to}} keep fighting. He came out and tried to ferociously attack Calzaghe, but Calzaghe charged back.|$|R
50|$|At around 04:00 hrs on the 5 August 2004, {{the club}} was hit by <b>another</b> devastating <b>blow</b> when their wooden stand (built in 1942), and which had {{witnessed}} {{so much of the}} history of {{the club was}} completely destroyed by fire.|$|R
50|$|The Federal Communication Commission (F.C.C.) {{was dealt}} <b>another</b> legal <b>blow</b> when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against it in {{throwing}} out fines and sanctions levied against broadcasters who violated the F.C.C. policy governing curse words and nudity on broadcast television.|$|R
