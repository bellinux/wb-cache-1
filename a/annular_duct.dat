40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} the design, construction, testing and modeling of controllable damping devices utilizing electro-rheological (ER) materials. The rheological properties of ER materials (yield stress and viscoelasticity) are extremely sensitive to electric fields. Modulations {{of the electric}} field in an electrorheological damper results in a corresponding change in device forces. The key feature of the ER devices described in this paper {{is a set of}} multiple concentric <b>annular</b> <b>ducts</b> through which the ER material flows. The <b>annular</b> <b>ducts</b> are formed by a set of concentric metallic tubes, which may be electrically charged with a high voltage potential, or electrically grounded. Three designs targeting different force levels (2 â€“ 6 kN), are designed, tested and modeled. The device analyses used in the design incorporate a simplified closed form relation for the flow behavior of ER materials. Evolutionary and algebraic device models are fit to the measured force response of the devices over a range of harmonic frequencies and at zero and high electric field magnitudes. The evolutionary model is motivated by observations and simulations of ER materials in simple shear, and the algebraic model is convenient for control and feedback linearization applications. The algebraic model is evaluated with data collected with random excitation and with switching electric fields. The three devices display different levels of pre-yield visco-elasticity. Friction, due to seals in the device, was not accounted for in the initial design, and affected the behavior of the device as tested...|$|R

40|$|Closed form {{asymptotic}} expressions for computing {{high frequency}} noise generated by an annular cascade in an infinite duct containing a uniform flow are presented. There are two new elements in this work. First, the <b>annular</b> <b>duct</b> mode representation does not rely on the often-used Bessel function expansion resulting in simpler expressions for both the radial eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the duct. In particular, the new representation provides an explicit approximate formula for the radial eigenvalues obviating the need for solutions of the transcendental <b>annular</b> <b>duct</b> eigenvalue equation. Also, the radial eigenfunctions are represented in terms of exponentials eliminating the numerical problems associated with generating the Bessel functions on a computer. The second new element is {{the construction of an}} unsteady response model for an annular cascade. The new construction satisfies the boundary conditions on both the cascade and duct walls simultaneously adding a new level of realism to the noise calculations.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers {{sound transmission}} in axisymmetric, uniformly-lined ducts of constant cross-section, carrying a high speed, subsonic, parallel mean shear flow. Fast and efficient numerical and analytical methods {{that can be}} used with high-frequency sound are developed. This is fundamentally theoretical work, but with a view to the specific engineering application of acoustic liner optimization in turbofan aero-engine ducts, as cylindrical and <b>annular</b> <b>ducts</b> are approximate models of inlet and bypass ducts, respectively. Focus has been given on applying those methods to problems for which the noise source, mean flow and duct geometry are representative of the turbofan aero-engine application. A new numerical procedure to calculate the small-amplitude pressure perturbation in the frequency domain with arbitrary mean velocity profiles is developed and a computer code is implemented. The method is a problem-specific finite element solver which, owing to the axisymmetric geometry, enables the rapid computation {{of a large number of}} modes at very high frequencies (e. g., several harmonics of the fanâ€™s blade passing frequency) at a modest computational cost. Because of its speed and accuracy, it may be suitable for application in practical design optimisation procedures for acoustic linings. Examples of finite element solutions of the eigenvalue problem in cylindrical and <b>annular</b> <b>ducts</b> are provided and results, which show how the shape of the boundary-layer profile can affect the modal structure of the in-duct pressure perturbation field are presented. In the special case of uniform core flow and thin boundary layers at duct walls, finite element solutions are compared with those obtained from an approximate perturbation method based on an asymptotic inner expansion valid in the boundary layer. An investigation of the effect of boundary-layer shielding on high-frequency sound transmission is carried out. A new cost function, which provides a quantifiable measure of an acoustic linerâ€™s performance for a multi-mode noise source is proposed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} aims at {{developing}} an acoustic formulation {{for the sound}} generated by the interaction of solid surfaces (such as blades) with an unsteady flow in an <b>annular</b> <b>duct</b> with swirl. Indeed, the mean flow in between the rotor and the stator of the fan or of a compressor stage is highly swirling. As a results, in order to properly predict the rotor self-noise radiated downstream of the rotor or the rotor-stator interaction noise radiated upstream of the stator, the swirling mean flow effect must be accounted for, either in the source terms or in the differential operator in an acoustic analogy. The proposed approach here, is to develop an acoustic analogy with an operator accounting for the swirl. It {{can be seen as}} an extension of Goldstein formulation in uniform mean flow (Aeroacoustics, 1976). The Navier-Stokes equations are first recast to outline the differential operator and the associated equivalent noise sources in space and time. Then the GreenÂ’s function tailored to the rigid <b>annular</b> <b>duct</b> with swirl is derived in the frequency domain. Finally, the effect of the swirl is studied on simple dipole sources and finally applied to rotor trailing-edge noise...|$|E

A numerical calculation using the standard k-Îµ turbulence model, with a modified procedure is also carried out. It is assumed that the thermodynamic fluid properties are independent of temperature. An experimental study is conducted to study the effect of the transverse convex surface curvature of the core tubes both on fully developed turbulent flows and heat transfer in concentric <b>annular</b> <b>ducts.</b> Air is used as the working fluid. Three annuli having different radii of the inner cores, Ri = 3. 98 mm, 8. 57 mm, and 16. 7 mm, with a fixed radius ratio of Î± = 0. 3, are used over a range of the Reynolds number between about 20, 000 and 60, 000. The inner cores are heated electrically to provide constant heat fluxes throughout the test sections and are instrumented for the temperature and power measurements. The outer tubes are insulated to minimize the leakage of heat. In the case of the experimental study for turbulent boundary layer flows and heat transfer on circular cylinders, the experimental data of Willmarth et al.
