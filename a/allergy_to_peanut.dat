40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Allergy</b> <b>to</b> <b>peanut</b> is common. However, it is {{not known}} whether the {{prevalence}} of sensitization and clinical <b>allergy</b> <b>to</b> <b>peanut</b> is increasing. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine any change in the prevalence of peanut sensitization and reactivity in early childhood in 2 sequential cohorts in the same geographic area 6 years apart. METHODS: Of 2878 children born between September 1, 1994, and August 31, 1996, living on the Isle of Wight, 1273 completed questionnaires, and 1246 had skin prick tests at the age of 3 to 4 years. Those with positive skin prick test responses to peanut were subjected to oral peanut challenges, unless there was a history of immediate systemic reaction. These data were compared with information on sensitization and clinical <b>allergy</b> <b>to</b> <b>peanut</b> available from a previous cohort born in 1989 in the same geographic area. RESULTS: There was a 2 -fold increase in reported peanut allergy (0. 5 % [6 / 1218] to 1. 0 % [13 / 1273]), but the difference was nonsignificant (P =. 2). Peanut sensitization increased 3 -fold, with 41 (3. 3 %) of 1246 children sensitized in 1994 to 1996 compared with 11 (1. 1 %) of 981 sensitized 6 years ago (P =. 001). Of 41 sensitized children in the current study, 10 reported a convincing clinical reaction to peanut, and 8 had positive oral challenge results, giving an overall estimate of peanut allergy of 1. 5 % (18 / 1246). CONCLUSIONS: Sensitization to peanut had increased between 1989 and 1994 to 1996. There was a strong but statistically nonsignificant trend for increase in reported peanut allergy. <br/...|$|E

40|$|Peanut allergies {{have been}} {{increasing}} in prevalence in most industrialized countries. Onset is typically in early childhood, with a trend towards earlier ages of presentation. The allergy is lifelong in most affected children, although 15 – 22 % will outgrow their peanut allergy, usually before their teenage years. Manifestations of peanut allergy range from mild to severe, and risk factors predisposing to severe reactions are discussed. However, {{even in the}} absence of risk factors, peanut allergic individuals may still experience life-threatening anaphylactic reactions. Approaches to investigation and treatment, patterns of cross-reactivity and possible causes of rising prevalence are discussed. Key words: peanut, allergy, anaphylaxis, nuts Food allergy is a common problem encountered by primary care physicians. It is estimated to affect 4 to 8 % of children and 1 to 2 % of adults and is considered a major cause of life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions. 1 – 3 Eight foods are responsible for more than 90 % of food allergies: cow’s milk, egg, soy, wheat, peanut, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish. 4 Among those foods, peanut has attracted considerable attention for several reasons.

40|$|Other factors {{than the}} {{allergen}} itself {{may be of}} importance {{in the development of}} food allergy. This report describes the influence of the immunosuppressive compound bis(tributyltin) oxide (TBTO), present in the food chain, on the development of food <b>allergy</b> <b>to</b> <b>peanut</b> or ovalbumin in Brown Norway (BN) rats. To study these effects BN rats were sensitized to either 1 or 10 mg peanut or ovalbumin by daily oral gavage and the TBTO-groups were fed a diet containing 80 mg TBTO per kg diet. Co-exposure to TBTO not only resulted in decreased general immunologic parameters such as weights of mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer's patches, lymphocyte proliferation rates in splenocytes, but also on allergic parameters. In the peanut allergen-model TBTO decreased allergen-specific Th 2 cytokine production by spleen cells, number of eosinophilic and basophilic granulocytes in the blood and production of mast cell protease II after oral food challenge. In the ovalbumin allergen-model TBTO decreased the number of eosinophilic and basophilic granulocytes, allergen-specific IgE and production of mast cell protease II after oral food challenge. The data imply that in the process of risk assessment of food allergy attention should be given to immunomodulating compounds present in the diet. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|<b>Allergy</b> <b>to</b> <b>peanut</b> {{and tree}} nuts is characterised {{by a high}} {{frequency}} of life-threatening anaphylactic reactions and typically lifelong persistence. Although peanut {{is the most common}} cause of nut allergy, peanut allergic patients are frequently also sensitive to tree nuts. It is not known if this is due to cross-reactivity between peanut and tree nut allergens. In this study, the major peanut allergen Ara h 2 was cloned from peanut cDNA, expressed in E. coli cells as a His-tag fusion protein and purified using a Ni-NTA column. Immunoblotting, ELISA and basophil activation indicated by CD 63 expression all confirmed the IgE reactivity and biological activity of rAra h 2. To determine whether or not this allergen plays a role in IgE cross-reactivity between peanut and tree nuts, inhibition ELISA was performed. Pre-incubation of serum from peanut allergic patients with increasing concentrations of almond or Brazil nut extract inhibited IgE binding to rAra h 2. Purified rAra h 2 -specific serum IgE antibodies also bound to proteins present in almond and Brazil nut extracts by immunoblotting. This indicates that the major peanut allergen, Ara h 2, shares common IgE-binding epitopes with almond and Brazil nut allergens, which may contribute to the high incidence of tree nut sensitisation in peanut allergic individuals. <br /...|$|E

MethodsTo investigate molecular cosensitization and cross-reactivity to peanut in hazelnut-sensitized individuals, children (n= 81) and adults (n= 80) were retrospectively selected based on sensitization to hazelnut. IgE to hazelnut extract, Cor a 1, 8, 9 and 14, to peanut extract, Ara h 1, 2, 3, 8 and 9, and to Bet v 1 was determined by ImmunoCAP. Allergy to hazelnut and peanut was established by DBPCFC and/or detailed clinical history. Patients were either tolerant or displayed subjective or objective symptoms to either food. IgE cross-reactivity between hazelnut and peanut storage proteins was assessed by reciprocal ImmunoCAP inhibition experiments. ResultsOf the 161 hazelnut-sensitized subjects, 109 (68 %) were also sensitized to peanut, and 73 (45 %) had clinical expression of <b>allergy</b> <b>to</b> <b>peanut</b> that was not associated with the presence or severity of hazelnut allergy. Instead, it was associated with IgE reactivity to peanut storage proteins, in particular Ara h 2. No cross-reactivity could be detected between Ara h 2 and Cor a 14, and 2 of 13 subjects displayed extensive cross-reactivity between 11 S globulins; in plasma of both individuals, Ara h 3 almost completely inhibited IgE binding to Cor a 9.

40|$|Probiotics are {{claimed to}} beneficially affect {{the immune system}} and their {{involvement}} in allergy prevention is being investigated extensively. However, the efficacy of probiotics in allergy prevention remains controversial. We investigated whether the probiotic Lactobacillus casei Shirota (LcS) could modulate the food allergic response against peanut extract (PE) in Brown Norway (BN) rats. For this purpose BN rats were sensitized to PE (0, 1 and 10 mg/(rat d)) by daily oral gavage and the LcS-groups were additionally orally dosed with 1 × 109 colony forming units LcS/(rat d). LcS administration had minor effects in animals that were not sensitized. LcS increased Th 1 -(PE-specific IgG 1), whereas the Th 1 /Th 2 ratio based on PE-specific IgG 1 /PE-specific IgG 2 a shifted towards Th 2 dominance in rats sensitized to PE in the presence of LcS as compared to rats that were sensitized to PE only. LcS stimulated PE-specific IgG 2 a; but for PE-specific IgE the effect was less clear; whereas there was no overall effect, two rats did not show detectable specific IgE antibodies, whereas the remainder showed significantly increased levels. LcS also resulted in increased numbers of basophilic granulocytes in blood. Furthermore, LcS increased levels of both Th 1 -(IFN-γ) and Th 2 -(IL- 4) related cytokines in PE stimulated spleen and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells, but predominantly IL- 4 levels in the supernatants of both spleens and MLNs.

40|$|Background Food allergy {{is common}} in childhood. It has been {{suggested}} that the magnitude of a skin prick test or specific IgE result can improve diagnostic usefulness, but this has been addressed in only a few tertiary challenge-based studies. Objective To determine the predictive value of a wheal ? 8 mm or serum specific IgE ? 15 kUA/L for clinical allergy and investigate whether results are generalizable. Methods All subjects, up to 16 years of age, who had been investigated with a peanut or tree nut food challenge were eligible for the study. Subjects were referred from either a tertiary allergy clinic or a community birth cohort. All subjects with a history suggestive of food allergy were offered a challenge unless there were features of anaphylaxis. Details of challenges were prospectively recorded. Results were modeled by using logistic regression. Results There was a total of 161 peanut challenges. Recent skin prick (longest wheal diameter) and specific IgE data were available for 135 and 136 challenges, respectively. The results suggest that a skin prick result ? 8 mm and a specific IgE ? 15 kUA/L have predictive values of 95 % (95 % CI, 76. 2 % to 99. 9 %) and 92. 0 % (74. 0 % to 99. 0 %), respectively, for a positive challenge. Age, the type of nut, and referral pattern of the subject did not appear to alter this relationship.

However, {{in the last few}} years, oral immunotherapy protocols have shown promising results yielding increased tolerance to peanut in allergic children. Adolescence is particularly at risk. Methods/Design: We have designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to investigate the efficacy and safety of peanut oral escalating immunotherapy in a 12 - to 18 -year-old population with proved <b>allergy</b> <b>to</b> <b>peanut.</b> Patients are selected when the threshold of peanut intake is over 100 mg and 2 cumulated g on the first double-blind, placebo-controlled oral food challenge (DBPCOFC). During the build-up placebo-controlled blinded phase, doses containing peanut or placebo will be administered by gradual up-dosing from 10 mg to 2 g with 2 -weekly increments. After this first randomized phase, the desensitized participants will continue to intake native peanut in an unblinded process during 13 or 37 weeks following a second randomization. Adverse events are picked up and managed throughout the entire protocol. The main endpoint is the percentage of patients with negative DBPCOFC at the threshold of 2 g of cumulative peanut {{at the end of the}} build-up phase of 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints include: (1) desensitization 6 weeks and 6 months after the end of the maintenance phase; (2) adverse effects during the build-up phase; (3) immunological profile confirming peanut desensitization.

Studies published in Europe from January 1, 2000, to September 30, 2012, were identified from searches of four electronic databases. Two independent reviewers appraised the studies and extracted the estimates of interest. Data were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. Fifty studies were included in a narrative synthesis and 42 studies in the meta-analyses. Although there were significant heterogeneity between the studies, the overall pooled estimates for all age groups of self-reported lifetime prevalence of allergy to cow's milk, egg, wheat, soy, peanut, tree nuts, fish, {{and shellfish}} were 6. 0 % (95 % confidence interval: 5. 7 - 6. 4), 2. 5 % (2. 3 - 2. 7), 3. 6 % (3. 0 - 4. 2), 0. 4 % (0. 3 - 0. 6), 1. 3 % (1. 2 - 1. 5), 2. 2 % (1. 8 - 2. 5), and 1. 3 % (0. 9 - 1. 7), respectively. The prevalence of food-challenge-defined allergy to cow's milk, egg, wheat, soy, peanut, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish was 0. 6 % (0. 5 - 0. 8), 0. 2 % (0. 2 - 0. 3), 0. 1 % (0. 01 - 0. 2), 0. 3 % (0. 1 - 0. 4), 0. 2 % (0. 2 - 0. 3), 0. 5 % (0. 08 - 0. 8), 0. 1 % (0. 02 - 0. 2), and 0. 1 % (0. 06 - 0. 3), respectively.

40|$|Background: Peanut allergy is a {{frequent}} and potentially life-threatening food allergy. Despite the large taxonomic distance between the plants, peanut allergic patients often react to tree nuts and seeds such as walnut, hazelnut and sesame. While the allergens of peanut and walnut, hazelnut and sesame have highly homologous amino acid sequences, it is unknown whether this similarity {{is responsible for the}} observed co-reactivity. Therefore, we analyzed the frequency of walnut, hazelnut and sesame allergy in peanut allergic patients and the binding of specific IgE-antibodies to sequential epitopes of peanut, walnut, hazelnut and sesame in peanut allergic patients with and without walnut/ hazelnut/ sesame allergy. Methods: The frequency of tree nut and sesame allergies in peanut allergic patients was analyzed with a standardized questionnaire. The IgE binding to known sequential epitopes of peanut and the homologous regions of walnut was measured via peptide microarray in 40 peanut allergic patients. 19 of these patients had a clinically relevant walnut allergy and 21 were walnut tolerant. Hazelnut tolerant and hazelnut allergic peanut allergic patients as well as sesame tolerant and sesame allergic peanut allergic patients were analyzed using the same method. Inhibition assays with peanut peptides and corresponding walnut and sesame sequences were performed to detect cross-reacting peptide-specific antibodies. Results: 110 of the 287 questionnaires were answered (38. 5 %) and the clinical information on nut allergies of the children (< 1 - 19 years) were evaluated. 46 patients had reactions to peanuts. In 18 of the 46 peanut allergic patients (39. 1 %), breathing difficulties and wheezing were reported as clinical symptoms of the allergic reaction. 14 of the peanut allergic patients (30. 4 %) reported reactions to at least one tree nut or sesame. 8. 7 % (4 patients) had reactions to more than one tree nut. 4 of the 46 peanut allergic patients (9 %) had reactions to walnut, 10 (22 %) to hazelnut and 2 (4 %) to sesame. 16 of the 46 parents of peanut allergic patients (34. 8 %) reported that they avoided walnut, hazelnut or sesame due to fear of a possible allergic reaction. In the peptide microarray, no differences in the recognition of sequential epitopes could be found between walnut/ hazelnut/ sesame allergic and walnut/hazelnut/ sesame tolerant patients. Few patients showed IgE binding to walnut, hazelnut and sesame sequences that corresponded to sequential epitopes of peanut. In the inhibition assays, no relevant IgE-antibodies to peanut sequences that cross-reacted with homologous walnut and sesame sequences could be detected for neither but one of the 9 tested peptides. Conclusion: Peanut allergic patients often co- react to tree nuts and sesame. However, in the current study {{there was no evidence that}} the co-incidence of <b>allergy</b> <b>to</b> <b>peanut</b> and walnut/ hazelnut/ sesame is the result of cross-reacting IgE-antibodies against homologous sequential epitopes of peanut and walnut/ hazelnut/ sesame...|$|E
40|$|Hazelnut is a {{frequently}} consumed tree nut. This thesis {{shows that}} allergic symptoms to hazelnut are common but highly variable in severity, and they differ between children and adults. Hazelnut allergy in adults is generally limited to mild and local symptoms {{in the oral}} cavity, whereas in children, more severe symptoms such as angio-edema, urticaria and dyspnea are frequently observed. In adults, hazelnut allergy is associated with birch pollen allergy, whereas in children, it is often accompanied by atopic dermatitis. A correct diagnosis is important, to advise appropriate dietary restrictions and emergency medication. In adults, a history with only oral symptoms specifically attributed to hazelnut in combination with birch pollinosis is convincing to diagnose a hazelnut allergy. A history of allergic reactions with previous ingestion of hazelnut is often unknown in children, because many children have an elimination diet solely based on sensitization. Therefore, the diagnosis in children strongly relies on diagnostic tests. The skin prick test (SPT) with hazelnut extract is a better predictor of a hazelnut allergy in children than laboratory tests for specific IgE to hazelnut. Although the SPT with hazelnut extract can {{reduce the number of}} double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFCs), a DBPCFC remains necessary in the majority of children to diagnose a hazelnut allergy. IgE to hazelnut seed storage proteins Cor a 9 and Cor a 14 was shown to be highly specific for a severe hazelnut allergy in children and adults. Determination of IgE to these components may identify almost all children and half of the adults with a severe hazelnut allergy, which may lead to a significant {{reduction in the number of}} high-risk DBPCFCs. The amount of hazelnut needed to elicit objective symptoms was comparable between children and adults. Several patient characteristics such as age, SPT to hazelnut extract and IgE to Cor a 9 and Cor a 14 influenced the threshold distribution curve (TDC) to hazelnut. Labeling information based on eliciting doses may improve the product choice of individuals with a severe hazelnut allergy. <b>Allergy</b> <b>to</b> <b>peanut</b> is common in individuals with a hazelnut allergy. Almost half of the children and adults with a sensitization to hazelnut seed storage proteins were also sensitized to their homologous proteins in peanut. This was shown not to be the result of IgE cross-reactivity, whereas at T cell level, cross-reactivity between hazelnut and peanut major allergens was observed. This suggests that cross-reactivity at T cell level may lead to IgE antibodies to related allergens that are not cross-reactive. This may explain the frequently observed co-sensitization to multiple tree nuts and peanut and may provide a basis to develop an immunotherapeutic target. In conclusion, our data show differences in clinical aspects of a hazelnut allergy between children and adults. Measurement of IgE to Cor a 9 and Cor a 14 may improve the diagnosis of a severe hazelnut allergy, which may result in a reduction of the number of DBPCFCs and unnecessary elimination diets. Better understanding of the mechanism leading to a concomitant hazelnut and peanut allergy may provide a basis for the development of preventive or therapeutic strategies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Food allergy {{is defined}} as an adverse {{immunologic}} response to a dietary protein. Food-related reactions {{are associated with a}} broad array of signs and symptoms that may involve many bodily systems including the skin, gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, and cardiovascular system. Food allergy is a leading cause of anaphylaxis and, therefore, referral to an allergist for appropriate and timely diagnosis and treatment is imperative. Diagnosis involves a careful history and diagnostic tests, such as skin prick testing, serum-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) testing and, if indicated, oral food challenges. Once the diagnosis of food allergy is confirmed, strict elimination of the offending food allergen from the diet is generally necessary. For patients with significant systemic symptoms, the treatment of choice is epinephrine administered by intramuscular injection into the lateral thigh. Although most children “outgrow” <b>allergies</b> <b>to</b> milk, egg, soy and wheat, <b>allergies</b> <b>to</b> <b>peanut,</b> tree nuts, fish and shellfish are often lifelong. This article provides an overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, management and prognosis of patients with food allergy. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Food allergy {{may affect}} the {{gastrointestinal}} tract and eosinophilia {{is often associated with}} allergic gastrointestinal disorders. <b>Allergy</b> <b>to</b> <b>peanuts</b> is a life-threatening condition and effective and safe treatments still need to be developed. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of sustained oral exposure <b>to</b> <b>peanuts</b> on the esophageal and jejunal mucosa in sensitized mice. We also evaluated the effects of desensitization with epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT) on these processes. Methods: Mice were sensitized by gavages with whole peanut protein extract (PPE) given with cholera toxin. Sensitized mice were subsequently exposed <b>to</b> <b>peanuts</b> via a specific regimen and were then analysed for eosinophilia in the esophagus and gut. We also assessed mRNA expression in the esophagus, antibody levels, and peripheral T-cell response. The effects of EPIT were tested when intercalated with sensitization and sustained oral peanut exposure. Results: Sustained oral exposure <b>to</b> <b>peanuts</b> in sensitized mice led to severe esophageal eosinophilia and intestinal villus sub-atrophia, i. e. significantly increased influx of eosinophils into the esophageal mucosa (136 eosinophils/mm 2) and reduced villus/crypt ratios (1. 660. 15). In the sera, specific IgE levels significantly increased as did secretion of Th 2 cytokines by peanut-reactivated splenocytes. EPIT of sensitized mice significantly reduced Th 2 immunological response (IgE response and splenocyte secretion of Th 2 cytokines) as well as esophageal eosinophilia (50 eosinophils/mm 2, p, 0. 05), mRN...|$|R
40|$|A case of {{anaphylaxis}} {{is reported}} {{in the course of}} a prick by prick with Lupinus albus and roasted peanut in a 20 -year-old woman. We focused on some main topics. First of all it seems important to underscore the potential risks connected to the practice of the prick-by-prick with fresh foods in allergic patients, especially when testing cross-reactive substances, such as White Lupine, peanuts, or soy. It is important that clinicians who perform prick tests be aware of the risk related with in vivo tests in allergic patients. Second, we discuss the problem of the hidden allergens, such as White Lupine flour, or soy flour which are utilized to improve wheat flour because of their lower cost. Patients with a demonstrated <b>allergy</b> <b>to</b> <b>peanuts</b> should be assessed for lupine allergy and informed about the “hidden allergens” issue. Finally, we believe that component resolved diagnosis, the serum specific IgE against molecular components, that is normally considered a second-level diagnostic step has an important role even as a first line approach at least in some selected cases...|$|R
40|$|<b>Allergy</b> <b>to</b> <b>peanuts</b> {{has become}} a common and severe problem, {{especially}} in westernized countries. In this study, we evaluated the target and epitope specificity of the capture and detection mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) used in a commercial peanut allergen detection platform. We first identified the target of these antibodies as Ara h 3 and then used an overlapping peptide array of Ara h 3 to determine the antibody-binding epitopes. Further amino acids critical for the binding via alanine substitutions at individual amino acid residues within the epitope were mapped. Finally, inhibition ELISA and inhibition immunoblotting using a recombinant Ara h 3 protein were performed to confirm these results. Surprisingly, the capture and detection mAbs showed identical binding characteristics and were presumed to represent two isolates of the same clone, a notion supported by both isoelectric focusing electrophoresis and Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry experiments. The simultaneous binding {{of a pair of}} identical mAbs to an individual allergen such as Ara h 3 is attributed to the multivalency of the analyte and has implications for developing diagnostic assays for additional multimeric allergens...|$|R
