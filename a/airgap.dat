50|$|In radial flux {{rotating}} electric machines, the resonance {{occurs at}} two conditions: {{there must be}} a match between the exciting Maxwell force and the stator or rotor natural frequency, and between the stator or rotor modal shape and the exciting Maxwell harmonic wavenumber (periodicity of the force along the airgap)As an example a resonance with the elliptical modal shape of the stator can occur if the force wavenumber is 2. Under resonance conditions, the maxima of the electromagnetic excitation along the <b>airgap</b> and the maxima of the modal shape displacement are in phase.|$|E
50|$|Electroshock {{weapons and}} tasers have a DC/AC {{inverter}} to generate several {{tens of thousands}} of V AC out of a small 9 V DC battery. First the 9 V DC is converted to 400-2000 V AC with a compact high frequency transformer, which is then rectified and temporarily stored in a high voltage capacitor until a pre-set threshold voltage is reached. When the threshold (set by way of an <b>airgap</b> or TRIAC) is reached, the capacitor dumps its entire load into a pulse transformer which then steps it up to its final output voltage of 20-60 kV. A variant of the principle is also used in electronic flash and bug zappers, though they rely on a capacitor-based voltage multiplier to achieve their high voltage.|$|E

5000|$|It is used {{extensively}} as an electrical insulator in tubular construction heating elements. There are several mesh sizes available and {{most commonly used}} ones are 40 and 80 mesh per the American Foundry Society. The extensive use is due to its high dielectric strength and average thermal conductivity. MgO is usually crushed and compacted with minimal <b>airgaps</b> or voids. The electrical heating industry also experimented with aluminium oxide, {{but it is not}} used anymore.|$|R
5000|$|Electromagnetic torque, {{which can}} be {{calculated}} as the average value of the Maxwell stress tensor along the <b>airgap,</b> is one consequence of electromagnetic forces in electric machines. As a static force, it does not create vibrations nor acoustic noise. However torque ripple (also called cogging torque for permanent magnet synchronous machines in open circuit), which represents the harmonic variations of electromagnetic torque, is a dynamic force creating torsional vibrations of both rotor and stator. The torsional deflection of a simple cylinder cannot radiate efficiently acoustic noise, but with particular boundary conditions the stator can radiate acoustic noise under torque ripple excitation [...] Structure-borne noise can also be generated by torque ripple when rotor shaft line vibrations propagate to the frame [...]|$|E
50|$|A pixel in an IMOD-based display {{consists}} {{of one or}} more subpixels that are individual microscopic interferometric cavities similar in operation to Fabry-Pérot interferometers (etalons), and the scales in butterfly wings. While a simple etalon {{consists of}} two half-silvered mirrors, an IMOD comprises a reflective membrane which can move in relation to a semi-transparent thin film stack. With an air gap defined within this cavity, the IMOD behaves like an optically resonant structure whose reflected color is determined {{by the size of the}} <b>airgap.</b> Application of a voltage to the IMOD creates electrostatic forces which bring the membrane into contact with the thin film stack. When this happens the behavior of the IMOD changes to that of an induced absorber. The consequence is that almost all incident light is absorbed and no colors are reflected. It is this binary operation that is the basis for the IMOD's application in reflective flat panel displays. Since the display utilizes light from ambient sources, the display's brightness increases in high ambient environments (i.e. sunlight). In contrast, a back-lit LCD suffers from incident light.|$|E
40|$|In a gapped inductor, <b>airgap</b> {{fringing}} flux induces {{eddy currents}} in coil conductors {{in the vicinity}} of the <b>airgap,</b> producing unwanted power loss and heat in the coil. An open-circuit copper screen placed around the <b>airgap</b> of a ferrite core is shown to reduce the fringing flux around the <b>airgap.</b> The reduction in fringing flux is shown by experiment to reduce the power loss, in the inductor winding, associated with eddy currents induced by <b>airgap</b> fringing flux, and practical results compare favourably with presented finite-element results. The reduction in coil losses reduces the cooling requirement for the inductor, or alternatively, allows an increase in the thermal rating of the inductor...|$|E
40|$|The heat {{requirement}} {{of a building}} can {{turn out to be}} greater than was calculated at the design stage. The reason for this may be that heat transport though the building envelope is greater than expected. This in turn can be due to the structure not fulfilling the design requirements in respect of windtightness and airtightness. In addition, there may be defects in the quality of the workmanship of the insulation that significantly reduce the thermal resistance of the external wall. The objective of this investigation has been to ascertain how normal variations in the insulation can affect heat transport through a well insulated wooden frame external wall under the influences of incident wind or wind flow through the wall. These 'normal variations' have been taken to be the presence of electrical conduits, breaks in the insulation, <b>airgaps</b> and nogging pieces, either singly or in combination. For incident wind, measurements in a hotbox and theoretical simulations have shown that the presence of electrical conduits, breaks in the insulation, <b>airgaps</b> or nogging pieces in a well insulated wooden frame external wall, whether singly or in combination, have negligible effect on thermal transport when subjected to incident wind. Heat transport is affected, however, by the presence of a break in the insulation: the combination of electrical conduits, <b>airgaps,</b> a nogging piece and a 16 mm gap in the insulation increased the U value of the wall by 0. 028 W/(m²·K) at the most. Measuring the effects of a flow of air through the insulation involved simulating a break in the air seal. A pressure difference of between 10 Pa and 20 Pa was established, causing air to flow from the cold side to the warm side. Measurements and calculations have shown that normal variations in the insulation have a negligible effect on the transmission losses on the cold side, due to the heat exchange effect of the insulation, which raises the temperature of the air flowing through it. This has meant that as the air flow increases, the transmission losses on the cold side have decreased while those on the warm side have increased. Air flow through a wall {{does not necessarily mean that}} the heat demand of the building will increase...|$|R

Then the reasonable power distribution between inner and outer <b>airgaps</b> had been discussed quantitatively.

40|$|Abstract: Conventional {{magnetic}} bearings {{accomplish a}} specific load capacity, {{defined as the}} ratio of maximum sustainable weight to the total self-weight, of up to 35 : 1. In this paper, the authors introduce a class of passive magnetic bearings that comprise {{a large number of}} par-allel <b>airgaps</b> and discs and can deliver specific load capacities substantially higher than 35 : 1. Two-dimensional planar, two-dimensional axi-symmetric, and three-dimensional finite-element analysis (FEA) have been undertaken to predict the force capability of the bearings. An unopti-mized prototype passive magnetic bearing is constructed to demonstrate the concept and its force-carrying capacity. The experimental results are then compared with those obtained from the FEA. Further optimization of the bearings is done across the whole design space comprising tens of thousands of models using an automatic mesh generator in conjunction with solving the FE models in nested loops...|$|R
40|$|The <b>airgap</b> {{harmonics}} {{are generated}} due to windings and {{variations in the}} <b>airgap.</b> Stator-rotor slotting, effects of saturation and <b>airgap</b> eccentricity are identified as major sources of <b>airgap</b> asymmetry. In this thesis, the <b>airgap</b> MMF and permeance functions are expressed as cosine waves. Using a step by step procedure, the <b>airgap</b> field harmonic components are derived. The analysis {{is based on the}} permeance method. The method delivers detailed information about the harmonic frequencies and corresponding pole pairs. In order to verify the validity of the analysis, extensive experimental investigations were carried out on a medium size (10 -hp) cage induction motor. A test-rig was designed and fabricated in such a manner that the <b>airgap</b> eccentricity can be set to the required value. The signals derived from the search-coils located in the narrow stator slot openings were analyzed {{with the help of a}} spectrum analyzer and oscilloscope. The harmonic frequencies were studied at different operating conditions.

Of particular interest is the phenomenon of 'axial-shaft-flux', which is produced in the presence of an eccentricity. A brief description is given about the shaft-flux...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} recover the performance of an electromagnetic suspension under faulty <b>airgap</b> sensor. The proposed control scheme {{is a combination of}} classical control loops, a Kalman Estimator and analytical redundancy (for the <b>airgap</b> signal). In this way redundant <b>airgap</b> sensors are not essential for reliable operation of this system. When the <b>airgap</b> sensor fails the required signal is recovered using a combination of a Kalman estimator and analytical redundancy. The performance of the suspension is optimised using genetic algorithms and some preliminary robustness issues to load and operating <b>airgap</b> variations are discussed. Simulations on a realistic model of such type of suspension illustrate the efficacy of the proposed sensor tolerant control method...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to carry out a {{preliminary}} comparison between two linear tubular synchronous, three-phase generators for WEC (Wave Energy Converter) applications. The first device is a conventional one, with a single slotted stator and a mover which is composed of Permanent Magnets (PMs) arranged in an Halbach array. The second configuration has two concentric stators and a mover with a system of North-South alternating magnetic poles. This mover slides in the <b>airgaps</b> between the two stators. The comparison was performed maintaining the same size (outer radius of the devices and length of the stators) and an equal volume of permanent magnets placed onto the slider part. All the simulations were carried out using a FEM code, capable to take into account the nonlinear behavior of the magnetic materials and the irregular movement imposed by the sea wave profile...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple method}} is {{presented}} to estimate the complex dielectric constants of individual layers of a multilayer composite material. Using the MatLab Optimization Tools simple MatLab scripts are written to search for electric properties of individual layers so as to match the measured and calculated S-parameters. A single layer composite material formed by using materials such as Bakelite, Nomex Felt, Fiber Glass, Woven Composite B and G, Nano Material # 0, Cork, Garlock, of different thicknesses are tested using the present approach. Assuming the thicknesses of samples unknown, the present approach is shown to work well in estimating the dielectric constants and the thicknesses. A number of two layer composite materials formed by various combinations of above individual materials are tested using the present approach. However, the present approach could not provide estimate values close to their true values when the thicknesses of individual layers were assumed to be unknown. This is attributed to the difficulty in modelling the presence of <b>airgaps</b> between the layers while doing the measurement of S-parameters. A few examples of three layer composites are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Additive Manufacturing (AM), a. k. a. 3 D Printing, is {{increasingly}} used to manufacture functional parts of safety-critical systems. AM's dependence on computerization raises {{the concern that}} the AM process can be tampered with, and a part's mechanical properties sabotaged. This {{can lead to the}} destruction of a system employing the sabotaged part, causing loss of life, financial damage, and reputation loss. To address this threat, we propose a novel approach for detecting sabotage attacks. Our approach is based on continuous monitoring of the current delivered to all actuators during the manufacturing process and detection of deviations from a provable benign process. The proposed approach has numerous advantages: (i) it is non-invasive in a time-critical process, (ii) it can be retrofitted in legacy systems, and (iii) it is <b>airgapped</b> from the computerized components of the AM process, preventing simultaneous compromise.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is aimed at the design and optimization of an interior permanent magnet (IPM) synchronous motor. Emphasis is placed on reducing the quadrature axis inductance, by means of which better vector control and faster dynamics of the machine is achieved. The reduction in q-axis inductance is obtained by shaping the <b>airgap.</b> A general mathematical model for both the uniform and shaped <b>airgap</b> machines, having a hypothetical stator winding distribution is derived in this thesis. From the mathematical model, some of the important design parameters such as q-axis inductance and torque are calculated for the IPM machine. The mathematical models are then validated using finite element analysis. The developed mathematical model is applied to two prototype machines each having different frame sizes. Calculated results from {{the application of the}} mathematical model to the prototype machines indicate that the q-axis inductance for the shaped <b>airgap</b> machine is reduced by about 45 % when compared to the q-axis inductance of the uniform <b>airgap</b> machine. Calculated results from the finite element models applied to the existing prototype machine indicate that the q-axis inductance for the shaped <b>airgap</b> machine is reduced by about 41 % when compared to the q-axis inductance of the uniform <b>airgap</b> machine. The percentage reduction between the shaped and uniform <b>airgap</b> machines, obtained from the application of finite element models to the 5. 5 kW prototype machine, is found to be equal to 33 %. The difference in the percentage reduction between the finite element results in relation to the two prototype machines is attributed to the assumptions that are used in the winding distributions employed in the finite element models...|$|E
40|$|Two {{new methods}} are {{proposed}} to predict <b>airgap</b> demand. <b>Airgap</b> demand is is the maximum expected {{increase in the}} water surface elevation caused incident waves interacting with an offshore structure. The first new method enables inclusion of some second-order effects, though {{it is based on}} only first-order diffraction results. The method is simple enough to be practical for use as a hand-calculation {{in the early stages of}} design. Two existing methods of predicting <b>airgap</b> demand based on first-order diffraction are also briefly presented and results from the three methods are compared with model test results. All three methods yield results superior to those based on conventional post-processing of first-order diffraction results, and comparable to optimal post-processing of second-order diffraction results. A second new method is also presented; it combines extreme value theory with statistical regression to predict extreme <b>airgap</b> events using model test data. Estimates of extreme <b>airgap</b> events based on this method are found to be more reliable than estimates based on extreme observations from a single model test. This second new method is suitable for use in the final stages of design...|$|E
40|$|For the {{effective}} {{operation of a}} magnetically levitated (maglev) vehicle using electro-magnetic suspension, {{it is necessary that}} the <b>airgap</b> between the guideway and the levitating magnets is maintained.

This paper describes the design of the suspension system for a high-speed maglev vehicle which ensures that the <b>airgap</b> is maintained...|$|E
40|$|Collaborative {{tests have}} been {{performed}} using nonstandard impulses, and employing {{a wide range of}} diagnostic techniques. Part 1 of the paper describes the need for such tests, the experimental arrangement and the digital data techniques developed for the tests. Part 2 is an account of the decay of the leader channel in long <b>airgaps</b> and the recovery of dielectric strength. It was found that the leader conductivity had a lifetime of the order of 1 ms. In part 3 of the paper, the influence of a nonstandard impulse front on the leader growth is examined in detail. The results show that overstressing of the gap can result in a reduced probability of break-down, and the cause of this effect is studied. In phase-to-phase structures, on the other hand, the case of a negative surge preceding a positive can be particularly dangerous: the effect of pre-existing negative space charges on positive leader growth is therefore described in part 4. Large-scale influences which cause more vigorous leader processes have been observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{resonance}} {{and radiation}} {{characteristics of a}} spherical microstrip with its circular metallic patch located inside a coating, possessing an arbitrary number of layers, are investigated. The developed methodology combines the Legendre transform with a T-matrix method. The appropriate basis functions for the surface current on the patch are chosen according to the cavity model. The complex resonant frequencies are the singular points of a homogeneous linear system, resulting by following a Galerkin's technique. The numerical results of this article propose novel multi-layered spherical microstrip configurations. More precisely, {{a new type of}} excitation that concerns an amplifying layer located between core and patch is proposed. The control mechanism of the amplifying capability via the layer's thickness and dielectric constant is reported. Moreover, the behavior of a microstrip with two <b>airgaps</b> that are surrounded by a zero-index material is analyzed. Finally, a coating's continuous distribution, following a ""shifted"" Luneburg law, is treated by a step approximation of the radial function of its dielectric constant, and the achieved high quality factor of such a microstrip is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of Information Assurance (IA) in military operations cannot be overstated. It is a {{sine qua non}} that achieving IA requires the effort of all personnel in the organization; just a single untrained end-user is needed to defeat many well thought-out and well-executed security strategies This thesis demonstrated that CyberCIEGE, with its rich elements and tools, {{can be used to}} create game scenarios, mimicking real life IA issues, for conveying security lessons to a wide audience of trainees. It provides an excellent alternative to the traditional methods of security education which so often fail in driving home the intended lessons. A military-based CyberCIEGE scenario definition file (SDF) was developed to illustrate and train players on the {{importance of}} ensuring hardware and software integrity in operational-critical systems. The focus of the research was on the protection of sensitive information systems through the maintenance of their software integrity and the application of an <b>airgapped</b> network architecture.

The complete model is derived and described in a general manner {{so that it can}} be easily extended to unconventional FE-SF topologies. By means of example, analytical predictions of <b>airgap</b> field are extensively compared and validated using 2 D FE results.

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis {{is concerned with the}} design, testing and manufacture of a disc machine in order to compaxe its power to weight ratio with conventional (radial) machines. In the former machine the active current carrying conductors are radially positioned while the useful <b>airgap</b> flux is parallel to the rotor shaft. Both the squirrel cage induction motor and reluctance motor are covered. The <b>airgap</b> flux is obtained directly from the product of the <b>airgap</b> permeance and the <b>airgap</b> m. m. f. The errors involved in using the permeance wave concept is assessed for the reluctance motor by comparing fundamental and harmonic components in the <b>airgap</b> flux waveform obtained using permeance waves with that obtained from conformal transformation techniques. An equation is determined {{that can be used for}} calculating the magnitude of the ma imum inertia that can be synchronised by the reluctance motor for the practical range of polearc/pole pitch ratios. It is shown that both machines have a potential power/weight ratio of twice that of the radial machine. For the induction motor and reluctance motor maximum outputs of 1260 watts and 1100 watts were obtained respectively in a frame size of 220 mm O/D and 110 mm long. The limitations of the prototype machines are discussed and the relationship between the reluctance motor performance and the principal machine parameters is obtained...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} eddy current losses induced in the rotor of {{coreless}} Axial-Flux machines. The calculation of eddy currents in the magnets requires the simulation of the inverter and the filter {{to obtain the}} harmonic content of the stator currents and FEM analysis of the magnets in the rotor. Due to the low inductance in coreless machines, the induced eddy current losses in the rotor remain lower than in traditional slotted machines. If only machine losses are considered, filters in DC/AC converters are not required in machines with wide <b>airgaps</b> as time harmonic losses in the rotor are very low. The harmonic content both from simulations and experimental results of a DC/AC converter are {{used to calculate the}} eddy currents in the rotor magnets. The properties of coreless machine topologies are investigated and some simplifications are proposed for time efficient 3 D-FEM analysis. The time varying magnetic field can be considered constant over the magnets when the pole is divided in several magnets. The simplified FEM method to calculate eddy current losses is applicable to coreless machines with poles split into several magnets, although the conclusions are applicable to all coreless and slotless motors and generators...|$|R
40|$|The best {{currently}} available transparent insulation materials (TIM) are characterised by a diffuse radiation transmission value of around 75 % and a thermal conductivity value below 1 W/(qmK). As an additional transparent cover (glass, special plaster) {{is needed for}} potection against the weather in outdoor applications, the radiation transmission decreases. However, the U-value is simultaneously improved by resulting <b>airgaps</b> and devices for temporary thermal insulation (mechanical blinds, etc.). In a series of demonstration projects, the first TIM facade systems were tested in operation and their functionality was confirmed. The shading devices guaranteed thermal comfort in summer but improvements are necessary for higher reliability for particular application conditions. By using TIM, together with conventional measures, in the renovation of an existing building in Freiburg, a specific heating energy consumption of 43 kWh/(qma) was achieved, a reduction of about 80 % relative to the o riginal consumption of the building. The "self- sufficient solar house" in Freiburg, which is being built at present, will demonstrate that with TIM and the latest technology for energy saving and solar energy use, a residential building can meet all its energy needs by the solar radiation incident on its outer surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Zinc-oxide (ZnO) surge arresters are {{now well}} {{established}} as a very efficient and reliable form of overvoltage protection against both fast surges, such as those generated by lightning and gas-insulated switchgear, and high-energy surges generated by switching operations and temporary faults on the network. The addition of ZnO surge arresters to existing protection schemes reinforces the system's reliability and the security of supply. The protection characteristics of the parallel configuration formed by arresters and existing spark gaps at distribution voltages are studied. Tests on various spark-gap geometries, with and without surge arresters in parallel, {{have been carried out}} to determine breakdown characteristics, probability curves and voltage–time characteristics for different impulse shapes. It is found that the introduction of the arrester in the circuit modifies the prospective impulse which results in the shift of the breakdown characteristics towards higher voltages. A proposed circuit model, based on laboratory test data, is used to simulate such parallel configurations. Good agreement between test and simulated results is obtained. As a result of these tests, it is recommended that gap-sparkover characteristics based on short-tail (about 5 µs) impulses are used for insulation co-ordination. The role of parallel <b>airgaps</b> in preserving the arrester energy-rating limits is also discussed...|$|R
