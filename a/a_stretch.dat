Chen and Char [5] presented an exact solution of heat transfer for <b>a</b> <b>stretching</b> surface with variable heat flux. P. S. Gupta and A. S. Gupta [6] examined the heat and mass transfer for the boundary layer flow over <b>a</b> <b>stretching</b> sheet subject to suction and blowing. Elbashbeshy and Bazid [7] studied heat and mass transfer over <b>an</b> unsteady <b>stretching</b> surface with internal heat generation.|$|R
30|$|Boundary layer flow over <b>a</b> <b>stretching</b> {{surface is}} {{important}} as {{it occurs in}} several engineering processes, for example, materials manufactured by extrusion. During the manufacturing process, <b>a</b> <b>stretching</b> sheet interacts with the ambient fluid both thermally and mechanically. The study of boundary layer flow caused by <b>a</b> <b>stretching</b> surface was initiated by Crane [7]. Recently, several works on the dynamic of the boundary layer flow over <b>a</b> <b>stretching</b> surface have appeared in literature (Dutta et al. [8], Hayat et al. [9], Ishak [10]). The effect of surface conditions on the micropolar flow driven by <b>a</b> porous <b>stretching</b> sheet was studied by Kelson and Desseaux [11]. Mohammadein and Gorla [12] examined the flow of micropolar fluids bounded by <b>a</b> <b>stretching</b> sheet with prescribed wall heat flux, viscous dissipation and internal heat generation. The effect of suction or injection at <b>a</b> <b>stretching</b> surface was studied by Erickson et al. [13] and Fox et al. [14]. The process of suction is used in many engineering activities such as thermal oil recovery, removal of reactants etc. Elbashbeshy and Bazid [15] studied the flow and heat transfer in a porous medium over <b>a</b> <b>stretching</b> surface. Bhargava et al. [16] investigated the flow of a mixed convection micropolar fluid driven by <b>a</b> porous <b>stretching</b> sheet with uniform section. Later, Bhargava et al. [17] studied the same flow of a micropolar flow over <b>a</b> nonlinear <b>stretching</b> sheet. Abel et al. [18] carried out a numerical study of hydromagnetic micropolar fluid flow due to horizontal/vertical <b>stretching</b> sheet using <b>a</b> shooting method. They highlighted a scientific approach for {{the choice of the}} missing initial values on which the convergence of the shooting method highly depends. Recently, Narayana and Sibanda [19] studied the effects of laminar flow of a nanoliquid film over <b>an</b> unsteady <b>stretching</b> sheet. Kameswaran et al. [20] studied hydromagnetic nanofluid flow due to <b>a</b> <b>stretching</b> or shrinking sheet with viscous dissipation and chemical reaction effects. Recently, Kameswaran et al. [21] studied homogeneous-heterogeneous reactions in a nanofluid flow over <b>a</b> permeable <b>stretching</b> sheet.|$|R

30|$|Owing to the {{importance}} of the fluid flow over <b>a</b> <b>stretching</b> surface because of its practical applications such as hot rolling, fiber plating, and lubrication processes, Crane [1] was the first researcher to investigate an analytical {{solution to the problem of}} Newtonian boundary layer equations for the flow due to <b>a</b> <b>stretching</b> surface. In the same context, similar problems of Newtonian flow at different situations past <b>a</b> <b>stretching</b> surface have been extended by many authors [2 – 5].|$|R

5|$|In the Amazon basin, when caimans became scarce as {{a result}} of {{overhunting}} in the mid-20th century, the number of local fish, such as the important arapaima (Arapaima gigas), also decreased. These are nutrient-poor waters, and the urine and faeces of the caimans may have increased primary production by contributing plant nutrients. Thus the presence of the reptiles could have benefited the fish stock; the number of crocodilians in <b>a</b> <b>stretch</b> of water appears to be correlated with the fish population.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>stretch</b> of land {{containing}} the later strategic strongholds of Amida (Diyarbakır, Turkey) and Bezabde came under firm Roman military occupation.

Many cities east of the Tigris came under Roman control, including Tigranokert, Saird, Martyropolis, Balalesa, Moxos, Daudia, and Arzan– though under what status is unclear. At the conclusion of the peace, Tiridates regained both his throne and the entirety of his ancestral claim. Rome secured a wide zone of cultural influence, which led to a wide diffusion of Syriac Christianity from a center at Nisibis in later decades, and the eventual Christianization of Armenia.|$|E
