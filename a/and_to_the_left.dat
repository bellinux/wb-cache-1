5|$|As {{shown in}} the figure, and as {{originally}} described by , Rule 184 {{may be used to}} model deposition of particles onto a surface. In this model, one has a set of particles that occupy a subset of the positions in a square lattice oriented diagonally (the darker particles in the figure). If a particle is present at some position of the lattice, the lattice positions below and to the right, and below <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> of the particle must also be filled, so the filled part of the lattice extends infinitely downward to the left and right. The boundary between filled and unfilled positions (the thin black line in the figure) is interpreted as modeling a surface, onto which more particles may be deposited. At each time step, the surface grows by the deposition of new particles in each local minimum of the surface; that is, at each position where it is possible to add one new particle that has existing particles below it on both sides (the lighter particles in the figure).|$|E
5|$|Cave 1 {{is divided}} into four parts: a veranda, a middle room, a cell, and a half cell. The veranda has a bench along the right wall. Its front {{possibly}} had two quadrangular pillars, traces of one are seen around the ceiling. A rock beam was present over the pillars, above the beam ribs and a rail pattern could have existed. In a recess below the veranda is an earth-filled cistern. A door with a small window to the left leads into the middle room. The middle room has a bench along the right wall. Towards {{the back of the}} middle room, to the left, is the half cell and to the right the cell. The half-cell has a bench along the right wall <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left,</b> has a square window connecting it to cave 2. A door with grooves for fitting a wooden frame, leads into the cell which has a bench along its right wall.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum is {{the first}} element and {{prototype}} of the lanthanide series. In the periodic table, it appears {{to the right of}} the alkaline earth metal barium <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> of the lanthanide cerium. Lanthanum is often considered to be a group 3 element, along with its lighter congeners scandium and yttrium and its heavier congener, the radioactive actinium, although this classification is sometimes disputed. Similarly to scandium, yttrium, and actinium, the 57 electrons of a lanthanum atom are arranged in the configuration 5d16s2, with three valence electrons outside the noble gas core. In chemical reactions, lanthanum almost always gives up these three valence electrons from the 5d and 6s subshells to form the +3 oxidation state, achieving the stable configuration of the preceding noble gas xenon. Some lanthanum(II) compounds are also known, but they are much less stable.|$|E

5|$|On 18 February, over 50,000 {{participated in}} the {{funerals}} of crackdown victims. One was held in Al Daih, another in Karzakan. The largest however, was in Sitra. At about 4:46 in the afternoon, about a thousand protesters, most of them young men who participated in Al Daih funeral of Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima marched toward Manama, defying the government ban on gatherings. By 5:18 they had reached a road junction; to the right was Salmaniya hospital <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> Pearl Roundabout. They turned left after a short pause. On their way, they clashed with riot police who withdrew from the site. Protesters continued their march removing barriers set by police a day ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{description}} {{provided by}} Blake to Humphrey {{explains that the}} work depicts the resurrection. The top of the work depicts Christ on the Throne of Judgement with Heaven opened up across the painting. Behind Christ are the heads of infants which represent creation coming from Jesus. Christ is surrounded by the four Zoas and seven angels that have vials filled with God's wrath. An image of a tabernacle with a cross inside is depicted above Christ. An image of baptism is to Christ's right and the Last Supper is to Christ's left with both representing eternal life. Further to Christ's right is {{the resurrection of the}} just <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> is the resurrection and subsequent fall of the wicked. Adam and Eve are below Christ, and Abraham and Moses are nearby. Below Moses is Satan wrapped by the Serpent and in the centre is the book of death. At the top is the book of life, and the Christian Church is the figure of a woman on top of the moon.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} commenced {{during a}} North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) air {{campaign against the}} VRS codenamed Operation Deliberate Force, targeting VRS air defences, artillery positions and storage facilities largely {{in the area of}} Sarajevo, but also elsewhere in the country. Days after commencement of the offensive, the VRS positions to the right <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> of the HV and the HVO advance were also attacked by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine – ARBiH) in Operation Sana. The offensive achieved its objectives and set the stage for further advances of the HV, HVO and ARBiH towards Banja Luka, contributing to the resolution of the war.|$|E
40|$|A {{body surface}} isopotential map was {{recorded}} in 30 cases of ASD and 3 cases of ECD with right bundle branch block in ECG, then analyzed in comparison with results obtained by cardiac catetherization and two dimensional echocardiograms. 1) In all cases of right bundle branch block, breakthrough minimum appeared later <b>and</b> shifted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> compared with <b>the</b> normal. 2) Breakthrough minimum of ASD and ECD appeared progressively later associated with Qp/Qs ratio <b>and</b> left <b>to</b> right intracardiac shunt ratio obtained with cardiac catetherization and RVDd with echocardiogram. Breakthrough minimum of ASD <b>and</b> ECD moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> accompanied by increases in mean RV pressure, mean PA pressure and RVDd. 3) R'max voltage, the maximum positive potential in the late stage of ventricular depolarization on the right precordial area, increased and correlated well with the mean RV pressure <b>and</b> left <b>to</b> right shunt ratio increment. 4) In the case of ASD, breakthrough minimum appeared later <b>and</b> shifted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> along with age...|$|R

5|$|The {{most common}} serious {{injuries}} were multiple lower leg fractures and dislocations, spinal fractures, hip fractures, head injuries, and multiple lacerations and contusions. The NTSB investigators found severe {{damage on the}} floor of the cabin, leading many of the passengers' seats to fracture where the legs met the floor track. This fracturing permitted many of the seats to come loose during the impact and aggravated the passengers' injuries. The report posits that the passengers' legs hit the lower seat frames in front of them. At the same time, the seats collapsed and twisted downward <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left,</b> likely causing hip and spinal fractures. As the impact progressed, the seats, now separated, flung passengers forward into each other as well as into other wreckage, causing head injuries and lacerations. Passengers holding onto infants reported being unable to either prevent their children from being ejected from their grasp in the impact or locate their children in the darkness afterward. The NTSB held that, had the children been in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved child seats, many injuries might have been mitigated. Rescuers remarked that some infants were found smiling or seemingly unharmed. The NTSB was unable to accurately chart where individual passengers were seated because Avianca only assigned seats to a few passengers and many who were assigned reported moving after takeoff.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} contour {{integration}} comprises {{a major part}} of complex analysis. In this context the direction of travel around a closed curve is important– reversing the direction in which the curve is traversed multiplies the value of the integral by 1. By convention the positive direction is counterclockwise. For example, the unit circle is traversed in the positive direction when we start at the point z = 1, then travel up <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> through the point z = i, then down <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> through 1, then down and to the right through i, and finally up and to the right to z = 1, where we started.|$|E
