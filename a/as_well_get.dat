25|$|In 1844 {{their mother}} took {{the girls to}} Paris to {{continue}} their studies, first with Francesco Piermarini, {{and then with the}} distinguished tenor Marco Bordogni. Bordogni thought highly of Sophie: it is said that he allowed her to sing only scales and solfeggi which he composed for her, for two whole years. After that time mother Crüwell wanted to remove her, saying that she had learnt scales enough and that {{if she was going to}} do nothing else she might <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>get</b> married and give it up. Bordogni persuaded mother that she would have a wonderful career, and that she should go on to complete her studies in Milan. A first public appearance in January 1846 was reported in the musical journal Revue et Gazette Musicale de Paris.|$|E
500|$|Actor Owen Wilson and his then-girlfriend, Carolina Cerisola, {{appear in}} the video. Lanford Beard of Middlebury College Student Weekly, in review of the video, wrote that Timberlake's [...] "Mexicali saloon setting" [...] for the video [...] "embraced a certain macho, trashy playa aesthetic" [...] for him [...] "so we'll take {{it on the chin}} that this is the image he's {{building}} for himself and [...] love it or hate it [...] we might <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>get</b> used to it." [...] In 2004, the video was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award in the category of Best Male Video.|$|E

'It’s still worth [...] for me ’cause I can’t believe I was ever married but whatever, end of story. And I knew that we wouldn’t {{be able to get a}} fabulous dress like in two days so I just took that dress out of the storage – it has a 27-foot train and it was just all hand-beaded and stuff and so I figured we might <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>get</b> a use out of it.' ...|$|E

500|$|Shortly after {{receiving}} the trophy, Adams was called over by pitchside reporter Jim Rosenthal for a conversation on the field, explaining his absence from the celebratory team photograph for the press. The Arsenal captain spoke of how his team-mates were [...] "really fired up" [...] before the game and was delighted with the effort they put in {{during the course of}} the match. Graham was proud of his team's performance, and credited Adams, who [...] "suffered an awful lot of stick which has given football very little dignity." [...] When asked about the result he said, [...] "Nobody outside Highbury expected us to do it, but when you lose belief you might <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>get</b> out of football." [...] Dalglish paid tribute to his players and refused to blame the fixture rearrangements for losing out to Arsenal, lamenting [...] "It just wasn't to be." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1965 season Tauranac {{was losing}} {{interest}} in this arrangement, reasoning that [...] "it {{was just a matter of}} a lot of effort for no real interest because I didn't get to go racing very much" [...] and [...] "I might <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>get</b> on with my main line business, which was selling production cars." [...] Although Brabham investigated using chassis from other manufacturers, the two men eventually agreed that Tauranac would have a greater interest in the Formula One team, which MRD eventually took over completely from BRO. This agreement was not reached until November 1965. Repco delivered the first example of the new engine to the team's headquarters in the United Kingdom in late 1965, just weeks before the first Formula One race to the new regulations, the non-championship South African Grand Prix on 1 January 1966. Rather than build a new car in the limited time available, BRO pressed chassis number F1-1-1965, the sole and unused BT19, into service.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. David Hinkley of The New York Daily News {{rated the}} pilot {{three out of}} five stars, stating [...] "The story and the {{chemistry}} work, but periodically the action feels rushed, as if {{we all know the}} drill and we might <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>get</b> it over with. Future episodes may correct that, because they'll need less setup work." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety stated [...] "On paper, [...] "Hawaii Five-0" [...] appears destined for can't-miss success, offering a pre-sold name, an attractive cast and a stunning location," [...] but felt the millions spent on the pilot [...] "doesn't necessarily indicate smooth sailing, relying as it does on playful banter (more like frat-boy hazing) between the leads that grows tiresome even before the hour's over." [...] Ellen Gray of the Philadelphia Daily News felt it was [...] "a huge let down," [...] and was critical of the cast's performance, in particular O'Loughlin and Caan.|$|E

500|$|The many {{historical}} {{meanings of}} the emblem, while provide a solid ground for its power as the national emblem of Iran, have also provided the rich ground for competing symbols of Iranian identity. One important campaign to abolish the emblem was initiated by Mojtaba Minuvi in 1929. In a report prepared {{at the request of}} the Iranian embassy in London, he insisted that the lion and sun is Turkic in origin. He recommended that the government replaces it with Derafsh-e-Kaviani: [...] "One cannot attributed a national historical story to the lion-and-sun emblem, for it has no connection to ancient pre-Islamic history, there is no evidence that Iranians designed or created it.... We might <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>get</b> rid of this remnant of the Turkish people and adopt the flag that symbolizes our mythical grandeur, that is Derafsh-e-Kaviani". His suggestion was ignored. The symbol was challenged during World War I, while Hasan Taqizadeh was publishing the Derafsh-e-Kaviani newspaper in Berlin. In his newspaper, he argued that the lion and sun is neither Iranian in origin nor very ancient as people assume. He insisted that the lion and sun should be replaced by the more Iranian symbol of Derafsh-e-Kaviani.|$|E
500|$|Hershiser picked Roberto Alomar off {{at first}} base to end the eighth inning. When the game went into extra innings, Hershiser {{did not want to}} continue: [...] "I really didn't want to break it", Hershiser said. [...] "I wanted to stop at 58. I wanted me and Don to be {{together}} at the top. But the higher sources (Lasorda and Perranoski) told me they weren't taking me out of the game, so I figured, what the heck, I might <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>get</b> the guy out." [...] Through the first nine innings, no Padre had reached second base. Lasorda, Perranoski and Ben Hines all felt he owed it to the game and to himself to continue. Hershiser made it through the tenth inning, with the record-setting out being a Keith Moreland flyball caught by right fielder José González. However, he had some close calls in a couple of innings. Marvell Wynne struck out swinging to open the inning, but reached first base after a wild pitch evaded [...] catcher Mike Scioscia. The following two hitters, Santiago and Randy Ready, moved Wynne over to third with two outs. Then, Garry Templeton was given an intentional base on balls. Templeton advanced to second base before the final out was recorded.|$|E
500|$|Woodhouse had {{a history}} of theft, robbery and affray, and said that he had [...] "fallen out of love" [...] with football. He {{admitted}} to have been involved in around 100 street fights. He said; [...] "Boxing has always been my first love, even as a kid", and [...] "I love fighting...Rather than get locked up for it, I might <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>get</b> paid for it." [...] He also stated that he used to spar in the boxing gym after football training without his manager's knowledge, saying [...] "A few times at Sheffield United, Neil Warnock would drag me in and say ‘I hear you’ve been boxing’. I’d be standing there with a big black eye and a fat lip and deny it." [...] He trained under former British featherweight champion, Gary De Roux, and made his boxing debut on 8 September 2006 at Grosvenor House Hotel, London, in a welterweight contest against Dean Marcantonio, despite not having any previous amateur experience. The former footballer had lost two stone in weight since his playing days with Grimsby Town. The fight was scheduled for four rounds of two minutes, Woodhouse knocked his opponent down twice in the final round and won on points.|$|E
