Having adopted a pay-as-you-go {{program for the}} state, {{he was forced to}} raise <b>additional</b> <b>revenue</b> after the war ended. He did so by imposing sin taxes on cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, and parimutuel betting, but he was unable to convince the General Assembly to adopt a sales tax.|$|E

The company owned and operated a variety of assets including gas pipelines, electricity plants, pulp and paper plants, water plants, and broadband services across the globe.

5|$|Willis renewed {{his call}} for an income tax repeal in the 1946 {{legislative}} session, but Democrats opposed the repeal and Republicans were split on the issue. The proposal failed {{by a vote of}} 36–60. Accomplishments of the session included better mine safety laws and stronger concealed weapons laws, and increased funding for black education. The war's end had brought <b>additional</b> <b>revenue</b> sources, and even with an expanded budget, the state experienced an $18 million surplus by the end of Willis's term.|$|E
5|$|In {{her first}} {{address to the}} legislature, Collins asked for an {{additional}} $324million from the Kentucky General Assembly, most of it allocated for education. The <b>additional</b> <b>revenue</b> was {{to be derived from}} Collins' proposed tax package, which included increasing the income tax on individuals making more than $15,000 annually, extending the sales tax to cover services such as auto repair and dry cleaning, and increasing the corporate licensing tax. After opposition to her proposal developed among legislators during the 1984 biennial legislative session, Collins revised the tax package. She retained the corporate licensing tax increase, but replaced the sales tax and income tax modifications with a flat five percent personal income tax and phasing out the deductions for depreciation which corporations could claim on their state taxes.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{supported}} raising various fees, {{including those}} for drivers' licenses and gun licenses, {{to raise more}} than $300million. He increased a special gasoline retailer fee by two cents per gallon, generating about $60million per year in <b>additional</b> <b>revenue.</b> Opponents said the reliance on fees sometimes imposed a hardship on those who could least afford them. Romney also closed tax loopholes that brought in another $181million from businesses {{over the next two}} years and over $300million for his term. He did so in the face of conservative and corporate critics who viewed these actions as tax increases.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to the task of cost determination for heat and power energy production for small size cogeneration plants. Cogeneration of heat and power is only possible if there is a demand for both types of energy. The consumers of both heat and power are considered as members of the coalition having a goal to gain <b>additional</b> <b>revenues</b> due to reduced investments and increased efficiency of power production. The suggested approach uses the cooperative game theory for distribution of the <b>additional</b> <b>revenues</b> between the members of the coalition. The examples from energy tariffs determination in the market environment show the rationality and efficiency of using the considered approach...|$|R
5|$|On October 7, 1987, Collins {{called a}} special {{legislative}} session {{to close a}} deficit between state contributions to the worker's compensation Special Fund and disbursements. The Special Fund was designated for payments to workers with occupational diseases and workers whose work-related injuries could not be traced to any single employer. A plan proposed by Democratic state senator Ed O'Daniel was expected to {{provide the framework for}} legislation considered in the session. Under O'Daniel's plan, <b>additional</b> <b>revenue</b> for the Special Fund would be raised by increasing assessments on worker's compensation premiums for 30 years. Assessments for coal companies were increased more than those on other businesses because the majority of the claims paid from the Special Fund were for black lung, a breathing disease common among coal miners; consequently, it was opposed by legislators from heavily coal-dependent counties. Nevertheless, after nine days of negotiations, a bill substantially similar to O'Daniel's original plan was approved by the legislature and signed by Collins.|$|E
5|$|One {{result of}} these changes were the Highland Clearances, by which much of the {{population}} of the Highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout the UK, but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under Scots law, the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions. The result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, or further afield to England, Canada, America or Australia. Many that remained were now crofters, living on very small rented farms with indefinite tenure used to raise various crops and animals. For these families kelping, fishing, spinning of linen and military service became important sources of <b>additional</b> <b>revenue.</b> Scotland suffered its last major subsistence crisis, when the potato blight that caused the Irish potato famine reached the Highlands in 1846. Some 150,000 people whose food supply was mainly potatoes faced disaster. They were rescued by an effective emergency relief system that stands in contrast to the failures of relief in Ireland, but the danger of starvation remained into the 1850s.|$|E

25|$|The first {{income tax}} {{suggested}} in the United States was during the War of 1812. The idea for the tax {{was based on the}} British Tax Act of 1798. The British tax law applied progressive rates to income. The British tax rates ranged from 0.833% on income starting at £60 to 10% on income above £200. The tax proposal was developed in 1814. Because the treaty of Ghent was signed in 1815, ending hostilities and the need for <b>additional</b> <b>revenue,</b> the tax was never imposed in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Yield {{management}} is of especially high relevance {{in cases where}} the constant costs are relatively high compared to the variable costs. The less variable cost there is, the more the <b>additional</b> <b>revenue</b> earned will contribute to the overall profit. This is because it focuses on maximizing expected marginal revenue for a given operation and planning horizon. It optimizes resource utilization by ensuring inventory availability to customers with the highest expected net revenue contribution and extracting the greatest level of ‘willingness to pay’ from the entire customer base. Yield management practitioners typically claim 3% to 7% incremental revenue gains. In many industries this can equate to over 100% increase in profits.|$|E
