40|$|A {{specific}} immunoglobulin, the <b>receptor</b> <b>antibody,</b> can {{be found}} in most patients with myasthenia gravis. In order to study the kinetic properties of this antibody, serial determinations of <b>receptor</b> <b>antibody,</b> total IgG and IgG 3 were made during drainage of thoracic duct lymph in three patients. The values obtained were used in a mathematical model to calculate some kinetic parameters. Values for T 1 / 2 and fractional rates of synthesis and catabolism obtained for total IgG and IgG 3 by this method were shown to agree with those found with other techniques. Most of the <b>receptor</b> <b>antibody</b> activity was found in the IgG 3 fraction but the <b>receptor</b> <b>antibody</b> had a shorter T 1 / 2 and higher fractional rates of synthesis and catabolism than IgG 3. These kinetic characteristics are consistent with rapid variations in plasma concentration of the <b>receptor</b> <b>antibody.</b> The cause of this rapid turnover could be strong antigenic stimuli and rapid elimination by the antigen, the cholinergic receptor protein...|$|R

Furthermore, the transplants were characterized by immunohistochemistry. Unlike after transplantation of thymus with lymphofollicular hyperplasia that induced high titers of anti-acetylcholine <b>receptor</b> <b>antibodies,</b> thymoma transplants never produced autoantibodies.

40|$|Reciprocal {{competition}} binding assays {{have previously}} demonstrated that 20 of 24 human rhinovirus serotypes tested {{compete for a}} single cellular receptor. These studies suggested {{that the vast majority}} of rhinovirus serotypes utilize a single cellular receptor. With HeLa cells as an immunogen, a mouse monoclonal antibody was isolated which had the precise specificity predicted by the competition binding study. The <b>receptor</b> <b>antibody</b> was shown to protect HeLa cells from infection by 78 of 88 human rhinovirus serotypes assayed. In addition, the <b>receptor</b> <b>antibody</b> protects HeLa cells from infection by three coxsackievirus A serotypes. The <b>receptor</b> <b>antibody</b> was unable to protect cells from infection by a wide range of other RNA and DNA viruses. Using the <b>receptor</b> <b>antibody</b> and human rhinovirus type 15, we determined that the cellular receptor utilized by the vast number of human rhinovirus serotypes is present only on cells of human origin, with the exception of chimpanzee-derived cells. The <b>receptor</b> <b>antibody</b> has a strong affinity for the cellular receptor as evidenced by its rapid binding kinetics and ability to displace previously bound human rhinovirus virions from receptors.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] Immunological {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} implicated in the pathogenesis of human dilated cardiomyopathy. The presence of autoantibodies against the beta 1 adrenoceptor in a substantial proportion of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy has been described and an association between the HLA-DR 4 phenotype and anti-beta <b>receptor</b> <b>antibodies</b> has been identified. The objective {{of the present study}} was to examine whether the presence of such antibodies in ischaemic cardiomyopathy was limited to specific HLA-DR phenotypes. DESIGN [...] The HLA-DR dependence of anti-beta <b>receptor</b> <b>antibodies</b> detected by a ligand binding inhibition assay in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 68) was compared with that in patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy (n = 73). RESULTS [...] 38 % of the patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 22 % of those with ischaemic cardiomyopathy had serum anti-beta <b>receptor</b> <b>antibodies.</b> In dilated cardiomyopathy, the presence of anti-beta <b>receptor</b> <b>antibodies</b> was linked to the HLA-DR 4 phenotype (that is, 50 % of patients with this phenotype were antibody positive) whereas, in those with ischaemic cardiomyopathy HLA-DR 1 was over-represented (that is, 37 % of the patients with the HLA-DR 1 phenotype were antibody positive compared with 17 % of the HLA-DR 1 negative patients). In both disease entities, the HLA-DR 3 phenotype was virtually absent in the anti-beta <b>receptor</b> <b>antibody</b> group. CONCLUSIONS [...] These results suggest that the presence of anti-beta <b>receptor</b> <b>antibodies</b> is under immune genetic control that may depend on the nature of the underlying disease process...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground and purposeThymectomy is {{generally}} accepted {{as the major}} option of treatment for myasthenia gravis. To elucidate the biological role of thymectomy {{in the treatment of}} myasthenia gravis, the immunologic characteristics of the thymus was studied in association with the postoperative kinetics of the anti-acetylcholine <b>receptor</b> <b>antibody</b> titer. Materials and methodsThirty-four patients with nonthymomatous myasthenia gravis who had positive anti-acetylcholine <b>receptor</b> <b>antibody</b> titer and undergoing extended thymectomy were subjected to the study. Reduction of anti-acetylcholine <b>receptor</b> <b>antibody</b> titer was evaluated in terms of the proportion of anti-acetylcholine <b>receptor</b> <b>antibody</b> titer at 1 year after thymectomy to that before the operation. The numbers of B lymphocytes (CD 19 + cells) and the germinal center B lymphocytes (CD 19 +CD 38 high cells) present in 1 g of the thymic tissue were calculated by flow cytometry. ResultsThe proportion of anti-acetylcholine <b>receptor</b> <b>antibody</b> titer at 1 year after thymectomy ranged from 27. 5 % to 150 %. The numbers of B lymphocytes and the germinal center B lymphocytes in 1 g of the thymic tissue ranged from 0. 19 × 106 /g to 162. 8 × 106 /g and from 0. 09 × 106 /g to 33. 4 × 106 /g, respectively. The proportion of anti-acetylcholine <b>receptor</b> <b>antibody</b> titer at 1 year after thymectomy had a significant inverted correlation with the number of B lymphocytes (P =. 002) {{as well as that of}} the germinal center B lymphocytes (P =. 007). ConclusionEffectiveness of thymectomy was dependent on predominance of B lymphocytes and the germinal center B lymphocytes in the thymus, suggesting that one of the biological roles of thymectomy in the treatment of myasthenia gravis is removing the thymus-associated germinal centers...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that intrathyroidal plasma cells are the major site of TSH <b>receptor</b> <b>antibody</b> synthesis in Graves' disease (GD). To investigate this hypothesis, serial serum levels of TSH <b>receptor</b> <b>antibodies,</b> as determined by a recently developed immunoprecipitation assay (IPA), were measured in 13 patients with GD before and after subtotal thyroidectomy (Tx). Pretreatment TSH <b>receptor</b> <b>antibody</b> levels (86. 4 +/- 26. 8 pM/ml; mean +/- s. d.) decreased significantly due to antithyroid drug therapy to 60. 3 +/- 21. 5 pM/ml (P less than 0. 05) just before Tx. However, 4 h after Tx, there was a significant increase (84. 9 +/- 35. 5 pM/ml; P less than 0. 05) due to leakage of antibodies from the manipulated thyroid gland. After Tx, no major decrease in autoantibody levels occurred; TSH <b>receptor</b> <b>antibodies</b> were still detectable 1 to 7 months after Tx (88. 7 +/- 44. 6 pM/ml). Neither an acute change nor an overall reduction in anti-microsomal (M) antibody titres was observed after Tx. Our conclusions are that serum TSH antibody levels exhibited a drug-induced decrease before Tx and an immediate, but transient, post-operative increase. The post-operative increase was caused by leakage of preformed TSH <b>receptor</b> <b>antibodies</b> from the manipulated thyroid gland. Several months after Tx, TSH <b>receptor</b> and anti-M <b>antibodies</b> were present in the same serum concentrations as before treatment. The present data does not support the hypothesis that plasma cells in the thyroid gland are the major site of autoantibody synthesis in GD at the time of Tx...|$|R

In 11 paired samples, serum levels were higher than (n = 10) or equal to (n = 1) cerebrospinal fluid levels; there was intrathecal synthesis of glycine <b>receptor</b> <b>antibodies</b> in each of the six pairs available for detailed study. Four patients also had high glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (> 1000 U/ml), and one had high voltage-gated potassium channel-complex antibody (2442 pM). Seven patients with very low titres (< 1 : 50) and unknown or alternative diagnoses were excluded from further study. Three of the remaining 45 patients had newly-identified thymomas and one had a lymphoma. Thirty-three patients were classified as progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus, and two as stiff person syndrome; five had a limbic encephalitis or epileptic encephalopathy, two had brainstem features mainly, two had demyelinating optic neuropathies and one had an unclear diagnosis. Four patients (9 %) died during the acute disease, but most showed marked improvement with immunotherapies. At most recent follow-up, (2 - 7 years, median 3 years, since first antibody detection), the median modified Rankin scale scores (excluding the four deaths) decreased from 5 at maximal severity to 1 (P < 0. 0001), but relapses have occurred in five patients and a proportion are on reducing steroids or other maintenance immunotherapies as well as symptomatic treatments. The glycine <b>receptor</b> <b>antibodies</b> activated complement on glycine receptor-transfected human embryonic kidney cells at room temperature, and caused internalization and lysosomal degradation of the glycine receptors at 37 °C.

Ten glycine <b>receptor</b> <b>antibody</b> positive samples were also identified in a retrospective cohort of 56 patients with stiff person syndrome and related syndromes. Glycine <b>receptor</b> <b>antibodies</b> are strongly associated with spinal and brainstem disorders, and the majority of patients have progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus.
