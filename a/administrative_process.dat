5|$|The {{doctrine}} of standing prevents applicants from burdening {{the court with}} frivolous or vexatious claims. This minimizes disruption in the <b>administrative</b> <b>process.</b> When an administrative decision by a public authority is challenged, implementation of {{the decision by the}} authority may be delayed. Therefore, the courts want to restrict access to applicants who have a genuine interest in challenging the decision. Furthermore, since the courts' resources are limited, restricting access to genuine claims ensures that judicial resources are appropriately allocated.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Administrative</b> <b>processes</b> are {{a type of}} {{business}} process commonly used in public institutions and large companies. These processes are frequently reused because there are often similar processes within the organizations. The use of ontologies for modeling the workflows of <b>administrative</b> <b>processes</b> can provide significant improvements in this reuse process. In this paper, we describe OntoMetaWorkflow, a generic ontology to represent canonical workflow terms {{in the domain of}} <b>administrative</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

In doing so, Trajan allowed Pliny to try cases according to his discretion.|$|E
25|$|The Lumbee resumed {{lobbying}} Congress, testifying in 1988, 1989, 1991 and 1993 {{in efforts}} to gain full federal recognition by congressional action. All of these attempts failed {{in the face of}} opposition by the Department of Interior, the recognized Cherokee tribes, including North Carolina's Eastern Band of the Cherokee; some of the North Carolina Congressional delegation, and some representatives from other states with federally recognized tribes. Some of the North Carolina delegation separately recommended an amendment to the 1956 Act that would enable the Lumbee to apply to the Department of Interior under the regular <b>administrative</b> <b>process</b> for recognition. In 2004 and 2006 the tribe made renewed bids for full recognition, to include financial benefits.|$|E

25|$|Once a {{potential}} victim {{has come into}} contact with state authorities, identifying the child as a victim of trafficking takes time. The process often benefits from a thorough understanding of the child’s story. For a child who is in trouble with the law, hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers and officers determine if the child is actually a victim of a crime herself, such as exploitation, abuse, or trafficking. For a child in an <b>administrative</b> <b>process,</b> such as an asylum procedure, hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers to detect cases of trafficking. Children may be hesitant to share their complete stories with authorities and appointed child welfare professionals. Some service providers have found that establishing trust and a stable relationship with the child encourages increased disclosure of experiences of exploitation and trafficking that might otherwise not be detected. The trust building process can include granting assistance and support services to ensure safety, well-being and development.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court's {{ruling in}} Colorado River {{motivated}} the Montana Legislature to enact critical {{amendments to the}} MWUA in 1979. In 1977, the DNRC began pressing for a general water adjudication law. The agency proposed that anyone who failed to register their water claim with the state would lose that claim. It recommended against {{the creation of a}} water court, and instead argued for an <b>administrative</b> <b>process</b> overseen by the agency itself. The subsequent adjudication would be inter se, to meet the requirements of the McCarran Act. Rather than act on the DNRC's proposals, the state legislature established a study committee to make recommendations to the legislature at its next session (to be held in 1979). On April 4, 1979, the legislature voted to include tribal and federal as part of the state's adjudication process. The following day, the federal governments filed four lawsuits in the U.S. District Court seeking to revive the two prior lawsuits as well as initiate four others to protect the water rights of the tribes in Montana. Despite the action, the Montana Legislature enacted wide-ranging amendments to the MWUA which created a state Water Court.|$|E

40|$|M. Phil. The role {{of foreign}} direct investment, in driving {{economic}} growth and development has been a contested one. There have always been views in favour of FDI and against. Foreign investment is attracted by predictable, transparent, non-discriminatory regulations of the host country. Consequently, negative administrative barriers (legal and regulatory requirements for establishing, operating and locating a business) can deter foreign investors. <b>Administrative</b> <b>processes</b> in South Africa are not consistent, efficient and transparent and they generally interfere with the operation of free markets. Theoretically, foreign investors are likely to invest in countries where <b>administrative</b> <b>processes</b> are consistent, efficient, transparent {{and high levels of}} certainty. This study‘s aims were to identify administrative barriers encountered in South Africa by foreign investor and to ascertain the levels of consistency, efficiency and transparency of administrative procedures. The study further propose solutions aimed at improving the levels of consistency, transparency and efficiency of <b>administrative</b> <b>processes</b> in order to easy, simplify or mitigate the burden of these processes. The study adopted a positivistic view and descriptive research method was employed. The survey questionnaire was used as the main data-gathering instrument for this study. The study found out that there were high levels of administrative barriers to foreign direct investment in South Africa and the processes were not consistency, efficient and transparent. The main conclusions drawn from this research were that current <b>administrative</b> <b>processes</b> to foreign direct investment are barriers to investment as they add an extra burden and cost to the investor investing in South Africa. This study proposed a multi-pronged administrative simplification strategies aimed at reducing and simplifying <b>administrative</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Hilberg's {{analysis}} of the steps {{that led to the}} destruction of European Jews revealed that it was [...] "an <b>administrative</b> <b>process</b> carried out by bureaucrats in a network of offices spanning a continent". [...] Hilberg divides this bureaucracy into four components or hierarchies: the Nazi Party, the civil service, industry, and the Wehrmacht armed forces – but their cooperation is viewed as [...] "so complete that we may truly speak of their fusion into a machinery of destruction". For Hilberg, the key stages in the destruction process were: definition and registration of the Jews; expropriation of property; concentration into ghettoes and camps; and, finally, annihilation. Hilberg gives an estimate of 5.1 million as the total number of Jews killed. He breaks this figure down into three categories: Ghettoization and general privation: over 800,000; open-air shootings: over 1,300,000; extermination camps: up to 3,000,000.|$|E
