5|$|It is also {{possible}} to explain why zero is even without referring to formal definitions.

5|$|Mr Carkdale (John Grillo), {{the head}} of English, very rarely utters {{anything}} but expletives.

5|$|Deprived of <b>a</b> <b>rationale</b> for {{existence}} by {{the national}} monument's establishment, Islandia languished. The hiring of a police chief in 1989 prompted questions from the National Park Service to the Dade County state attorney's office, headed by Janet Reno. In 1990 Reno's office determined after investigation {{that all of the}} town's elections were invalid, since the elections were restricted only to landowners, not residents. The town was finally abolished by the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners in March 2012.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} how <b>an</b> individually developed <b>rationale</b> affects {{the acceptability of}} a given treatment intervention. Sixty substance abusers currently in treatment at a Midwestern Veterans Administration Medical Center participated in this study. The Intervention Rating Profile (Witt 2 ̆ 6 Martens, 1983) {{was used to measure}} each participant 2 ̆ 7 s acceptance of the standardized treatment intervention. ^ Each of the participant 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes regarding his own alcohol/substance abuse problem was assessed using the author developed Perception Assessment Interview. They were then given a treatment intervention preceeded by either <b>a</b> matching <b>rationale,</b> <b>a</b> generic <b>rationale,</b> or no rationale at all. After reading the suggested intervention, each participant rated the intervention 2 ̆ 7 s acceptability. ^ The standard treatment intervention preceeded by <b>a</b> matching <b>rationale</b> was rated as significantly more acceptable than when preceeded with no rationale at all. However, the difference between acceptability ratings of the intervention when preceeded by <b>a</b> generic <b>rationale</b> and no rationale at all was not significant. There was also {{no significant difference between the}} acceptability ratings of the intervention preceded by <b>a</b> matching <b>rationale</b> versus <b>a</b> generic <b>rationale.</b> Implications of these findings and suggestions for future research are discussed. ...|$|R

5|$|In a 5-4 decision, the Court {{overturned}} the silver platter doctrine and Elkins' conviction. Associate Justice Potter Stewart wrote the majority opinion, while Associate Justices Felix Frankfurter and John M. Harlan II dissented.

5|$|On {{the night}} of June 14, while the Lithuanian {{government}} was discussing the ultimatum, Soviet soldiers began actions at the border.

5|$|There {{are three}} steps to a Batson inquiry. First, the party {{opposing}} {{the use of}} a peremptory challenge must make a prima facie case. This requires only an inference, not preponderance. Second, the party seeking the peremptory challenge must provide a permissible, neutral explanation for the challenge. Third, the trial court must decide whether the explanation is pretextual. <b>A</b> <b>rationale</b> is pretextual if it applies equally to a similarly situated juror who was seated.|$|E

5|$|Also in Oregon v. Mitchell, the Supreme Court {{addressed}} {{the constitutionality of}} various other provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. The Court upheld Section 202, which prohibits any state or local jurisdiction from requiring people to live in their borders for longer than 30 days before allowing them to vote in a presidential election. Additionally, the Court upheld the provision lowering the minimum voting age to 18 in federal elections, but it held that Congress exceeded its power by lowering the voting age to 18 in state elections; this precipitated the ratification of the Twenty-sixth Amendment the following year, which lowered the voting age in all elections to 18. The Court was deeply divided in Oregon v. Mitchell, {{and a majority of}} justices did not agree on <b>a</b> <b>rationale</b> for the holding.|$|E
5|$|Both the United States and Australia {{cited the}} {{alliance}} as justification for involvement in Vietnam. U.S. membership in SEATO provided the United States with <b>a</b> <b>rationale</b> for a large-scale U.S. {{military intervention in}} Southeast Asia. Other countries, such as the UK and key nations in Asia, accepted the rationale. In 1962, {{as part of its}} commitment to SEATO, the Royal Australian Air Force deployed CAC Sabres of its No. 79 Squadron to Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. The Sabres began {{to play a role in}} the Vietnam War in 1965, when their air defence responsibilities expanded to include protection of USAF aircraft using Ubon as a base for strikes against North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Henry was by now fully {{determined}} {{to take the}} throne, but presenting <b>a</b> <b>rationale</b> for this action proved a dilemma. It was argued that Richard, through his tyranny and misgovernment, had rendered himself unworthy of being king. However, Henry was not next in line to the throne; the heir presumptive was Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, who was descended from Edward III's third son, the second to survive to adulthood, Lionel of Antwerp. Bolingbroke's father, John of Gaunt, was Edward's fourth son, the third to survive to adulthood. The problem was solved by emphasising Henry's descent in a direct male line, whereas March's descent was through his grandmother.|$|E

5|$|After the New Avengers {{are forced}} to allow Osborn to capture Luke Cage when he needs medical treatment, the team uses a {{tracking}} device Osborn had planted in Cage to trick him into blowing up his own house, after rescuing Cage from Osborn's custody. Osborn then creates <b>a</b> <b>rationale</b> to invade Asgard, claiming it poses a national security threat. During a pitched battle with several superheroes, Sentry causes Thor's world to fall to Earth. In the middle of Osborn's fight with Captain America, Stark removes Osborn's armor remotely, revealing Osborn used green facepaint to create a goblin-like look. Osborn screams {{that they do not}} know what they have done, only for Spider-Man to knock him down. He tells them they are all dead as the Void is released. Osborn knocks out Rogers and tries to escape, but is captured by Volstagg. Incarcerated in The Raft penitentiary, he blames his Green Goblin alter-ego for ruining his chance to protect the world as Iron Patriot.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Excessive {{accumulation}} of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides {{in the brain}} results initially in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and finally in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Evidences from experimental and clinical studies show that pathological hyperexcitability of hippocampal neurons is a very early functional impairment observed in progressive memory dysfunctions. Therefore, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) whose mechanism of action is aimed at inhibition of such neuronal hyperexcitability, seems to be <b>an</b> <b>rationale</b> choice for MCI and AD treatment...|$|R
