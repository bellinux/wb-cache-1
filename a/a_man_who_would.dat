5|$|Soon after {{assuming}} the throne, Edward set about restoring order and re-establishing royal authority after the disastrous reign of his father. To accomplish this, he immediately ordered an extensive change of administrative personnel. The {{most important of}} these was the appointment of Robert Burnell as chancellor, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> remain in the post until 1292 as one of the King's closest associates. Edward then replaced most local officials, such as the escheators and sheriffs. This last measure was done in preparation for an extensive inquest covering all of England, that would hear complaints about abuse of power by royal officers. The inquest produced the set of so-called Hundred Rolls, from the administrative subdivision of the hundred.|$|E

When Gunn returned, and learned of this, he went looking for Bogan, and warned him that if this {{happened}} again, he would arrest Bogan. To this, Bogan replied {{that he would do}} as he pleased. Constable Gunn had a reputation, which he had shown on several occasions, as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> not back down nor be intimidated, and was known to have killed two men while holding that office. Gunn was a former Texas Ranger, who'd made his way up to Wyoming from Texas. Bogan hated Gunn, who had reprimanded him on several occasions by this point. However, by later witness accounts, Bogan feared Gunn, which probably led to what happened next.|$|E

Once, while patrolling about {{at night to}} inquire into the condition of people, he heard a woman asker her daughter to mix water into the milk before the day-break.

When the mother retorted {{by saying that the}} Caliph was not present and he would not know of it, the daughter replied that God is Omniscient even if Caliph was not present. Umar I was so pleased with the reply that he asked his son Asim to marry the girl, saying that he hoped that she will give birth to <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> rule over Arabia.

Winners Okorafor and China Miéville noted in 2011 that they disliked being honored by a bust of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> have found many of the winners and nominees distasteful because of their race.

Johnston for the surrender of Confederate forces in North Carolina {{in exchange for the}} existing state government remaining in power, with private property rights to be respected. This did not even acknowledge the freedom of those in slavery. This was not acceptable to Johnson or the Cabinet who sent word for Sherman to secure the surrender without making political deals, which he did. Further, Johnson placed a $100,000 bounty (equivalent to $ in [...] ) on Confederate President Davis, then a fugitive, which gave him the reputation of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> be tough on the South. More controversially, he permitted the execution of Mary Surratt for her part in Lincoln's assassination. Surratt was executed with three others, including Atzerodt, on July 7, 1865.|$|E

Gokhale, a Hindu, later stated that Jinnah [...] "has true stuff in him, and that freedom from all sectarian prejudice which will make him the best ambassador of Hindu–Muslim Unity".

The album, which consisted mostly of slower ballads (with the exception of [...] "Dreamlover", [...] "Now That I Know", and [...] "I've Been Thinking about You"), contained collaborations with some carry-on producers and writers from Emotions. Of these were Clivillés & Cole (of C+C Music Factory), who co-wrote the track [...] "Now That I Know", a danceable pop ballad, which used similar formulas and synthesizers from tracks on Emotions. Another writer–producer that worked on the album was David Hall, who with Carey wrote the U.S. single [...] "Dreamlover".|$|E

Queen Victoria often took Beatrice from her cot, hurried to her bed and [...] "lay there sleepless, clasping to her child, wrapped in the nightclothes of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> wear them no more." [...] After 1871, when the last of Beatrice's elder sisters married, Queen Victoria came to rely upon her youngest daughter, who had declared from an early age: [...] "I don't like weddings at all. I shall never be married. I shall stay with my mother." [...] As her mother's secretary, she performed duties such as writing on the Queen's behalf and helping with political correspondence. These mundane duties mirrored those that had been performed in succession by her sisters, Alice, Helena and Louise. However, to these the Queen soon added more personal tasks. During a serious illness in 1871, the Queen dictated her journal entries to Beatrice, and in 1876 she allowed Beatrice to sort the music she and the Prince Consort had played, unused since his death fifteen years earlier.|$|E

He drove a flamingo-pink Cadillac, and was an accomplished singer and dancer, who once pursued a career in the entertainment industry. According to ESPN.com's Ron Flatter: [...] "He was the pioneer of boxing's bigger-than-life entourages, including a secretary, barber, masseur, voice coach, a coterie of trainers, beautiful women, a dwarf mascot and lifelong manager George Gainford." [...] When Robinson first traveled to Paris, a steward referred to his companions as his [...] "entourage". Although Robinson said he did not like the word's literal definition of [...] "attendants", since he felt they were his friends, he liked the word itself and began to use it in regular conversation when referring to them. In 1962, in an effort to persuade Robinson to return to Paris—where he was still a national hero—the French promised to bring over his masseur, his hairdresser, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> whistle while he trained, and his trademark Cadillac.
