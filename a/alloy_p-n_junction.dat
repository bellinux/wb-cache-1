Contacts to Si {{which are}} {{self-doping}} and self-aligning were investigated. Such contacts are applicable both to conventional cell structures as selective emitters and to more demanding {{structures such as}} interdigitated back contact cells. Emphasis was placed on alloyed contacts of AI for providing a self-doping p-type contact and of Ag-Sb for a self-doping n-type contact. Alloying at 900 °C of 1. 1 % (wt.)

50|$|The {{forward-bias}} and the reverse-bias {{properties of}} the <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> imply {{that it can be}} used as a diode. A <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> diode allows electric charges to flow in one direction, but not in the opposite direction; negative charges (electrons) can easily flow through the junction from n to p but not from p to n, and the reverse is true for holes. When the <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> is forward-biased, electric charge flows freely due to reduced resistance of the <b>p-n</b> <b>junction.</b> When the <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> is reverse-biased, however, the junction barrier (and therefore resistance) becomes greater and charge flow is minimal.|$|R

The unique structure of nanowire <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> enables substantial light absorption along the nanowire and efficient radial carrier separation and collection. A coupled three-dimensional optoelectronic simulation is used to evaluate the performance of the structure. With an excellent current matching, a promising efficiency of 19.9 % can be achieved at a low filling ratio of 0.283 (the density of the nanowire array), which is much higher than the tandem axial <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions.</b>|$|R

However, of great importance is to form an acceptable ohmic contact on magnetic diode, which is assumed to be ideal during the magnetic <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> analysis.

40|$|Problem statement: High cost of {{the solar}} cells {{is one of the}} {{important}} limitations in extensively using of the photovoltaic panels. Thin monocrystalline silicon solar cell could be reduce the cost but lost the absorption efficiency. Surface texturing help to enhance absorption. Using of advance texturing by diffraction grating was suggested for high absorption. It is necessary to investigate the scattering effect of diffraction grating with other solar cell parameter for optimization. In first step we concentrate on <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> position impact by modeling. Approach: The effect of position of <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> on the output current for both micro rectangular texturing and planer surface in solar cell has been investigated by ray tracing. Modeling of nine pairs solar cells with the same texture and planer surfaces but with different <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> position are done by using Atlas software. The output short current is a criterion for determining of efficiency performance. By comparing of the short current for each pair we was find the impacts of texturing and <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> depth on the monocrystalline thin film. Results: Light scattering due to diffraction grating inside the silicon with rectangular depth of 5 µm and a range of 5 - 40 µm <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> depths are investigated. The difference of short current in textured to bare silicon showed the enhancement from 4 - 8 µA when the <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> depths vary from 5 - 45 µm. Conclusions: Comparison of short current output confirms the correlation between <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> depth and texturing. Advanced texturing improve the solar cell efficiency but the effectiveness change with the <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> depth and need a simultaneous optimization for getting the high efficiency solar cell...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a theoretical investigation of recombination at grain boundaries in both bulk and <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> regions of silicon solar cells. Previous models of grain boundaries and grain boundary properties are reviewed. A two dimensional numerical model of grain boundary recombination {{is presented in}} this paper. This numerical model is compared to existing analytical models of grain boundary recombination within both bulk and <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> regions of silicon solar cells. This analysis shows that, under some conditions, existing models poorly predict the recombination current at grain boundaries. Within bulk regions of a device, the effective surface recombination velocity at grain boundaries is overestimated {{in cases where the}} region around the grain boundary is not fully depleted of majority carriers. For vertical grain boundaries (columnar grains), existing models are shown to underestimate the recombination current within <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> depletion regions. This current has an ideality factor of about 1. 8. An improved analytical model for grain boundary recombination within the <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> depletion region is presented. This model considers the effect of the grain boundary charge on the electric field within the <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> depletion region. The grain boundary charge reduces the <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> electric field, at the grain boundary, enhancing recombination in this region. This model is in agreement with the numerical results over a wide range of grain boundary recombination rates. In extreme cases, however, the region of enhanced, high ideality factor recombination can extend well outside the <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> depletion region. This leads to a breakdown of analytical models for both bulk and <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> recombination, necessitating the use of the numerical model...|$|R

40|$|Creation of {{high quality}} <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> in {{graphene}} monolayer is vital in studying many exotic phenomena of massless Dirac fermions. However, even with the fast progress of graphene technology {{for more than ten}} years, it remains conspicuously difficult to generate nanoscale and atomically-sharp <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> in graphene. Here, we employ monolayer-vacancy-island engineering of Cu surface to realize nanoscale <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> with atomically-sharp boundaries in graphene monolayer. The variation of graphene-Cu separations {{around the edges of the}} Cu monolayer-vacancy-island affects the positions of the Dirac point in graphene, which consequently lead to atomically-sharp <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> with the height as high as 660 meV in graphene.

30|$|Solar {{cells are}} {{classified}} into different schemes based {{either on the}} historical evolution or on their principles of operation. The class of solar cells based on a <b>p–n</b> <b>junction</b> {{is the first of}} its evolution and, therefore, are typically called first-generation solar cells [11, 12]. Semiconductors, either elemental such as Si or Ge or compounds such as GaAs or InP, are materials of choice to build <b>p–n</b> <b>junction</b> solar cells. Photoexcited carriers in the <b>p–n</b> <b>junction</b> are separated into mobile carriers by the built-in-electric field, or band bending, at the junction between the p- and the n-type semiconductors [12, 13, 14]. The photovoltage in the <b>p–n</b> <b>junction</b> is the difference in quasi-Fermi levels (i.e., the band bending) of n-type and p-type regions. A typical device consists of a 5  μm-long n-type semiconductor and 300  μm-long p-type ones, i.e., the minority carriers in the <b>p–n</b> <b>junction</b> are expected to travel ~ 300  μm for efficient charge collection, which requires rigorous control on their chemical purity [12, 15]. Requirement of such extreme purity of the semiconductors {{is one of the major}} cost limiters of the first-generation solar cells. The <b>p–n</b> <b>junctions</b> are typically built on single crystalline and polycrystalline platforms. The latter polycrystalline overcomes the cost limitations on chemical purity, however, at the expense of the photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) [14, 16]. Whether or not a <b>p–n</b> <b>junction</b> is made from single or polycrystals, inherent limitations between the absorption and electron emission in those crystals put a theoretical limit on the photovoltaic conversion efficiency in <b>p–n</b> <b>junction</b> solar cells, known as a Schokely–Queisser limit.
