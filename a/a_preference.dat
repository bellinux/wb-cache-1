5|$|In Europe, Amanita ceciliae is {{widespread}} everywhere, though infrequently encountered. It often inhabits deciduous forests with hornbeam (Carpinus), oak (Quercus), beech (Fagus) and birch (Betula), {{but it can}} also rarely occur with conifers: pine (Pinus), fir (Abies), spruce (Picea) and cedar (Cedrus).

50|$|In a {{modified}} Borda count (MBC), {{the number of}} points given for a voter's first and subsequent preferences {{is determined by the}} total number of options or candidates they have actually ranked, rather than the total number listed. This is to say, typically, on a ballot of n options/candidates, if a voter casts only m <b>preferences</b> (where n≥m≥1), <b>a</b> first <b>preference</b> gets m points, <b>a</b> second <b>preference</b> m-1 points, and so on. In more general terms, <b>an</b> 'x'th <b>preference,</b> if cast, gets one more point than <b>an</b> 'x+1'th <b>preference</b> (whether cast or not). The MBC involves no special weighting: the difference is always just one point.|$|R
50|$|The {{classic example}} of a {{positional}} voting electoral system is the Borda count. Typically, for a single-winner election with N candidates, <b>a</b> first <b>preference</b> is worth N points, <b>a</b> second <b>preference</b> N - 1 points, <b>a</b> third <b>preference</b> N - 2 points and so on until the last (Nth) preference that is worth just 1 point. So, for example, the points are respectively 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a four-candidate election.|$|R

5|$|The +3 {{oxidation}} state {{is known in}} compounds like manganese(III) acetate, but these are quite powerful oxidizing agents and also prone to disproportionation in solution, forming manganese(II) and manganese(IV).

5|$|Thelephora palmata is an ectomycorrhizal species, forming mutualistic {{associations}} with conifers. Fruit bodies grow singly, scattered, or in {{groups on the}} ground in both coniferous and mixed forest and grassy fields. <b>A</b> <b>preference</b> has been noted for moist ground, and locations along woodland paths. An uncommon species, fruit bodies can be difficult to see because they blend well into their surroundings.|$|E
40|$|Topological {{separability}} {{is crucial}} for the utility representation of <b>a</b> complete <b>preference</b> relation.

We consider the problem of representing <b>an</b> incomplete <b>preference</b> relation {{by means of a}} vector-valued utility function; we obtain representation results under the lower separability assumption.

40|$|In this note, we analyze a {{sequentially}} rationalizable choice {{model with}} a transitive rationale and <b>a</b> standard <b>preference.</b> The model in this note is more restrictive than the Rational Shortlist Method (RSM) model which is proposed in Manzini and Mariotti (2007) to capture cyclic behavior. Yet, a decision maker in our model exhibits cyclic behavior in general. We prove that the cyclicity of <b>an</b> indirectly revealed <b>preference</b> is exactly what distinguishes the RSM framework (a sequential choice model with <b>a</b> non-standard <b>preference)</b> from our transitive-RSM framework (a sequential choice model with <b>a</b> standard <b>preference).</b> We also provide a partial identiﬁcation result on the representation. ...|$|R
