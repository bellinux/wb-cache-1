25|$|In 2010, {{before the}} system was {{declared}} operational, Iron Dome was criticized by Reuven Pedatzur, a military analyst, former fighter pilot and {{professor of political science}} at Tel Aviv University for costing too much compared to the cost of a Qassam rocket (fired by Palestinian forces), so that launching very large numbers of Qassams could essentially attack Israel's financial means. The estimated cost of each Tamir interceptor missile has been cited from US$20,000–50,000 whereas a crudely manufactured Qassam rocket costs around $800 and the cost of each Hamas Grad rocket is only several thousand dollars each. Rafael responded that the cost issue was exaggerated since Iron Dome intercepts only rockets determined to constitute a threat, and that the lives saved and the strategic impact <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> cost.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theory of}} {{creative}} {{people is the}} investment theory of creativity. This approach {{suggest that there are}} many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the investment sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea {{to the point that it}} is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This investment theory of creativity views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.|$|E

500|$|Los Angeles Times {{reviewer}} Kenneth Turan {{felt that}} it was difficult {{to make sense of the}} film, saying that it relied too heavily on the series' mythology.

[...] None of their friends would be caught in the explosion. [...] He asked if Catesby had spoken of the matter with Garnet, or any other Jesuits; although Catesby was in no doubt that the Jesuits disapproved of any such action, he lied and said that he would not act without their approbation. [...] Catesby then named the other conspirators, and promised Digby that as soon as they reached Gayhurst he would demonstrate that their religion allowed such acts of regicide, thus dissuading the young lord from confessing to Garnet and discovering the Jesuit's opinion of the matter. [...] Catesby told him to rent Coughton Court from the head of the Throckmorton family, so that he would [...] "the better {{to be able to do}} good to the cause [...] ". [...] From there, he was to organise a hunting party (in reality a group of armed men on horseback) and be ready for some kind of military manoeuvre.

2500|$|In {{his most}} famous work, The Theory of the Leisure Class, Veblen writes {{critically}} of the leisure class for its role in fostering wasteful consumption. In this first work Veblen coined the term [...] "conspicuous consumption", which he defined as spending more money on goods than they <b>are</b> <b>worth.</b> <b>The</b> term originated during the Second Industrial Revolution when a nouveau riche social class emerged {{as a result of}} the accumulation of capital wealth. He explains that members of the leisure class, often associated with business, are those who also engage in conspicuous consumption in order to impress the rest of society through the manifestation of their social power and prestige, be it real or perceived. In other words, social status, Veblen explained, becomes earned and displayed by patterns of consumption rather than what the individual makes financially. Subsequently, people in other social classes are influenced by this behavior and, as Veblen argued, strive to emulate the leisure class. What results from this behavior, is a society characterized by the waste of time and money. Unlike other sociological works of the time, The Theory of the Leisure Class focused on consumption, rather than production.|$|E
2500|$|The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) {{recommends}} {{against the}} PSA test {{for prostate cancer}} screening in healthy men regardless of age. They concluded that the potential benefit of testing does not outweigh the expected harms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shared that conclusion. The American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American College of Physicians discourages screening {{for those who are}} expected to live less than ten to fifteen years, while in those with a greater life expectancy a decision should be made by the person in question based on the potential risks and benefits. In general, they concluded, [...] "it is uncertain whether the benefits associated with PSA testing for prostate cancer screening <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> harms associated with screening and subsequent unnecessary treatment." [...] American Urological Association (AUA 2013) guidelines call for weighing the benefits of preventing prostate cancer mortality in 1 man for every 1,000 men screened over a ten-year period against the known harms associated with diagnostic tests and treatment. The AUA recommends screening decisions in those 55 to 69 be based on shared decision making, and that if screening is performed it should occur no more often than every two years.|$|E
2500|$|To improve freshness, the crawler should penalize the {{elements}} that change too often. The optimal re-visiting policy is neither the uniform policy nor the proportional policy. The optimal method for keeping average freshness high includes ignoring the pages that change too often, and the optimal for keeping average age low is to use access frequencies that monotonically (and sub-linearly) increase with {{the rate of change}} of each page. In both cases, the optimal is closer to the uniform policy than to the proportional policy: as Coffman et al. note, [...] "in order to minimize the expected obsolescence time, the accesses to any particular page should be kept as evenly spaced as possible". Explicit formulas for the re-visit policy are not attainable in general, but they are obtained numerically, as they depend on the distribution of page changes. Cho and Garcia-Molina show that the exponential distribution is a good fit for describing page changes, while Ipeirotis et al. show how to use statistical tools to discover parameters that affect this distribution. Note that the re-visiting policies considered here regard all pages as homogeneous in terms of quality ("all pages on the Web <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> same"), something that is not a realistic scenario, so further information about the Web page quality should be included to achieve a better crawling policy.|$|E

2500|$|Consisting {{largely of}} {{tropical}} forest, Cabinda produces hardwoods, coffee, cocoa, crude rubber, and palm oil. The product {{for which it}} is best known, however, is its oil. Conservative estimates say that Cabinda accounts for close to 60% of Angola’s oil production, estimated at approximately , and it is estimated that oil exports from the province <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> equivalent of US$100,000 per annum for every Cabindan. Yet Cabinda remains one of the poorest provinces in Angola. An agreement in 1996 between the national and provincial governments stipulated that 10% of Cabinda’s taxes on oil revenues would be given back to the province, but Cabindans often feel that these revenues do not benefit the population as a whole, largely because of corruption. The private sector, particularly the oil industry, has both affected and been affected by the secessionist conflict. During the early days of Cabinda's struggle, the oil companies were perceived as sympathetic to, if not supportive of, Cabinda’s self-determination cause. The strategy used by the separatists to gain international attention, was most evident in 1999 and 2000. During 1999, FLEC-R kidnapped four foreign workers (two Portuguese and two French citizens), but released them after several months, having failed {{to attract the attention of}} the international community. FLEC-FAC also increased its activities during 2000 with the more widely-publicized kidnapping of three Portuguese workers employed by a construction company, while FLEC-R kidnapped another five Portuguese civilians. These hostages were not freed until June 2001, following diplomatic intervention by the governments of Gabon and Congo-Brazzaville.|$|E
