5|$|The half-lives of {{mendelevium}} isotopes mostly increase smoothly from 245Md onwards, {{reaching a}} maximum at 258Md. Experiments and predictions {{suggest that the}} half-lives will then decrease, apart from 260Md with a half-life of 31.8days, as spontaneous fission becomes the dominant decay mode due to the mutual repulsion of the protons posing <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> the island of relative stability of long-lived nuclei in the actinide series.|$|E
5|$|Every {{player has}} <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> {{the number of}} units they can create—a {{population}} limit—but may not immediately use the entire potential population. The population capacity, which can be capped at anywhere between 75 – 200 in intervals of 25, {{is based on the}} number of houses, Castles, or Town Centers—the main building in a player's town—which have been built. The Age of Kings introduced two significant new features for unit management: the idle villager button, which helps players identify villagers that have not been assigned a task, and the town bell, which sends all a player's villagers into their Town Center, Castle, or tower for safety; units garrisoned within these three buildings, especially archers, increase the building's firepower (towers fire more arrows with units garrisoned inside) including the town center, which cannot fire anything at all without someone garrisoned there.|$|E
5|$|First {{announced}} in June 2014, Spider-Man Unlimited was released for Apple iOS, Android and Windows Phone on September 10, 2014. Starting in October 2014, Gameloft released seven updates that added new chapters {{to the story}} mode, Spider-Man and Spider-Woman, enemies, events and stages. Since its release, it has been downloaded 30 million times and has been well received by gaming critics. Reviewers praised the game's controls, sound, animation and the variety of characters, while criticizing its energy system, which they considered <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> the playability.|$|E

5|$|In late December, the {{government}} began restoring services gradually. The websites for Xinhua and the People's Daily, two state-controlled media outlets, were made accessible on 28 December, the web portals Sina.com and Sohu.com on 10 January 2010, and 27 more websites on 6 February. But access to websites was only partial: for instance, users could browse forums and blogs but not post on them. China Daily reported that limited e-mail services were also restored in Ürümqi on 8 February, although a BBC reporter writing at approximately the same time said e-mail was not accessible yet. Text messaging on cell phones was restored on 17 January, although there was <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> how many messages a user could send daily. Internet access was fully restored in May 2010.|$|E
5|$|The half-lives of {{nobelium}} isotopes increase smoothly from 250No to 253No. However, a dip {{appears at}} 254No, and beyond this the half-lives of even-even nobelium isotopes drop sharply as spontaneous fission becomes the dominant decay mode. For example, the half-life of 256No is almost three seconds, {{but that of}} 258No is only 1.2milliseconds. This shows that at nobelium, the mutual repulsion of protons poses <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> the region of long-lived nuclei in the actinide series. The even-odd nobelium isotopes mostly continue to have longer half-lives as their mass numbers increase, with {{a dip in the}} trend at 257No.|$|E

If no candidate in the elections secures more than 50% of the votes, a runoff election is held in 14 days. The Constitution of Croatia sets <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> a maximum of two terms in office and requires election dates to be determined within 30 to 60days before the expiry of the term of the incumbent president. Any citizen of Croatia of 18 or over may be a candidate in a presidential election, provided that the candidate is endorsed by 10,000 voters. The endorsements are required in form of a list containing name, address, personal identification number and voter signature. The presidential elections are regulated by an act of the parliament.|$|E
5|$|Unbiunium is {{predicted}} {{to be the first}} element of an unprecedentedly long transition series, called the superactinides in analogy to the earlier actinides. While its behaviour {{is not likely to be}} very distinct from its lighter congeners in group 3, it is likely to pose <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> the applicability of the periodic law; after element 121, the 5g, 6f, 7d, and 8p1/2 orbitals are expected to fill up together due to their very close energies, and around the elements in the late 150s and 160s the 9s, 9p1/2, and 8p3/2 subshells join in, so that the chemistry of the elements just beyond 121 and 122 (the last for which complete calculations have been conducted) is expected to be so similar that their position in the periodic table would be purely a formal matter. Like its lighter congeners, unbiunium could be considered to begin the 7d series of elements, which would be the fifth row of transition metals.|$|E

25|$|The {{variability}} of production {{from a single}} wind turbine can be high. Combining any additional number of turbines (for example, in a wind farm) results in lower statistical variation, {{as long as the}} correlation between the output of each turbine is imperfect, and the correlations are always imperfect due to the distance between each turbine. Similarly, geographically distant wind turbines or wind farms have lower correlations, reducing overall variability. Since wind power is dependent on weather systems, there is <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> the benefit of this geographic diversity for any power system.|$|E

25|$|In microeconomics, the Bertrand–Edgeworth {{model of}} price-setting {{oligopoly}} looks at {{what happens when}} there is a homogeneous product (i.e. consumers want to buy from the cheapest seller) where there is <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> the output of firms which they are willing and able to sell at a particular price. This differs from the Bertrand competition model where it is assumed that firms are willing and able to meet all demand. The limit to output can be considered as a physical capacity constraint which is the same at all prices (as in Edgeworth’s work), or to vary with price under other assumptions.|$|E

25|$|A key fact, not {{realised}} initially, is {{the advantage}} of the heterozygotes, which survive better than either of the homozygotes. This affects the caterpillars as well as the moths, in spite of the caterpillars being monomorphic in appearance (they are twig mimics). In practice heterozygote advantage puts <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> the effect of selection, since neither homozygote can reach 100% of the population. For this reason, {{it is likely that the}} carbonaria allele was in the population originally, pre-industrialisation, at a low level. With the recent reduction in pollution, the balance between the forms has already shifted back significantly.|$|E
25|$|Every {{player has}} <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> {{the total number}} of units they can create—a {{population}} limit—but may not immediately use the entire potential population. The population limit increases with the number of houses or town centers in the player's village to a maximum of 200, with each house contributing five (or ten for the Norse) and each town center contributing 20 to the limit. There are two important features for unit management: The idle villager button, which helps players identify villagers that have not been assigned a task, and the town bell, which sends all of the player's villagers into the nearest town center, fortress or tower for safety.|$|E
25|$|Cho and Garcia-Molina {{proved the}} {{surprising}} result that, {{in terms of}} average freshness, the uniform policy outperforms the proportional policy in both a simulated Web and a real Web crawl. Intuitively, the reasoning is that, as web crawlers have <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> how many pages they can crawl in a given time frame, (1) they will allocate too many new crawls to rapidly changing pages {{at the expense of}} less frequently updating pages, and (2) the freshness of rapidly changing pages lasts for shorter period than that of less frequently changing pages. In other words, a proportional policy allocates more resources to crawling frequently updating pages, but experiences less overall freshness time from them.|$|E
