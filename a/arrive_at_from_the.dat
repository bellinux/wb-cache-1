40|$|A {{definition}} {{of the field of}} semantics is attempted, approaching its development <b>from</b> <b>the</b> earliest studies, in connection with those of etymology as well as with those of classical grammar. Reasons are given for the prevalence of the lexical approach in traditional semantics, and the question of the referent, excluded in structuralist studies but reintroduced in contemporary theories, is also taken into account. An approximation with classical semantics is <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> exams of the most significant contemporary trends, with emphasis on prototype theory as part of cognitive linguistics. Evolutionary paths are seen as based on encyclopedic knowledge {{as well as on the}} human ability of categorization.

40|$|Concept models, or 'ontologies' {{represented}} in description logics are becoming central to many efforts in re-usable medical terminologies. Developers of any ontology {{must make a}} series of choices concerning how concepts are represented. These choices are made more difficult by {{the limitations of the}} logical formalisms in which ontologies are represented and the complexity of the pragmatics of medical usage, {{as well as by the}} sheer size and scope of medicine. Principles for ontology structure to guide developers are still poorly.

40|$|It {{is noted}} that the trace element {{concentration}} patterns of continental and ocean island basalts and of mid-ocean ridge basalts are complementary. Estimates of the relative sizes of the source regions for these fundamentally different basalt types can be <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> trace element enrichment-depletion patterns. Their combined volume occupies {{the greater part of}} the mantle above the 670 km discontinuity. It is pointed out that the source regions separated as a result of early mantle differentiation and crystal fractionation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> resulting melt. The mid-ocean ridge basalts source evolved from an eclogite cumulate that gave up its late-stage enriched fluids at various times to the shallower mantle and continental crust. The mid-ocean ridge basalts source is rich in garnet and clinopyroxene, while the continental and ocean island basalt source is a garnet peridotite that has experienced secondary enrichment. These relationships are found to be consistent with the evolution of a terrestrial magma ocean...|$|R
40|$|Rayleigh–Bénard {{convection}} in liquids with nanoparticles is modelled as {{a single}} phase system with liquid properties like density, viscosity, thermal expansion coefficient, heat capacity and thermal conductivity modified {{by the presence of}} the nanoparticles.

Ginzburg–Landau equation is <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> generalized Lorenz model. The amplitudes of convective modes required for estimating the heat transport are determined analytically. A table is prepared documenting the actual values of the thermophysical properties of water, ethylene-glycol, engine-oil and glycerine with different nanoparticles, namely copper, copper oxide, titania, silver and alumina, and Nusselt number is calculated. Enhanced thermal conductivity being the reason for the enhancement of heat transport due to the presence of the nanoparticles is shown. Detailed discussion is made on the percentage increase of heat transport in twenty Newtonian nanoliquids compared to that in Newtonian liquids without nanoparticles...|$|R
