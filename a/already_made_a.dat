5|$|Responsibility {{for nuclear}} power {{and nuclear weapons}} was {{transferred}} from the Manhattan District to the United States Atomic Energy Commission on 1 January 1947. On 29 January 1947, Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson and Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal issued a joint directive creating the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP) to control the military aspects of nuclear weapons. Groves was appointed its chief on 28 February 1947. In April, AFSWP moved from the New War Department Building to the fifth floor of the Pentagon. Groves had <b>already</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> start on the new mission by creating Sandia Base in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The Bristol and Exeter Railway amalgamated {{with the}} GWR on 1 January 1876. It had <b>already</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> start on mixing the gauge on its line, a task {{completed}} through to Exeter on 1 March 1876 by the GWR. The station here had been {{shared with the}} LSWR since 1862. This rival company had continued to push westwards over its Exeter and Crediton line and arrived in Plymouth later in 1876, which spurred the South Devon Railway to also amalgamate with the Great Western. The Cornwall Railway remained a nominally independent line until 1889, although the GWR held {{a large number of}} shares in the company. One final new broad-gauge route was opened on 1 June 1877, the St Ives branch in west Cornwall, although there was also a small extension at Sutton Harbour in Plymouth in 1879. Part of a mixed gauge point remains at Sutton Harbour, one of the few examples of broad gauge trackwork remaining in situ anywhere.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps no {{director}} better displayed {{that spirit}} than the German-born Robert Siodmak, who had <b>already</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> score of films before his 1940 arrival in Hollywood. Working mostly on A features, he made eight films now regarded as classic-era film noirs (a figure matched only by Lang and Mann). In addition to The Killers, Burt Lancaster's debut and a Hellinger/Universal co-production, Siodmak's other important {{contributions to the}} genre include 1944's Phantom Lady (a top-of-the-line B and Woolrich adaptation), the ironically titled Christmas Holiday (1944), and Cry of the City (1948). Criss Cross (1949), with Lancaster again the lead, exemplifies how Siodmak brought {{the virtues of the}} B-movie to the A noir. In addition to the relatively looser constraints on character and message at lower budgets, the nature of B production lent itself to the noir style for economic reasons: dim lighting saved on electricity and helped cloak cheap sets (mist and smoke also served the cause); night shooting was often compelled by hurried production schedules; plots with obscure motivations and intriguingly elliptical transitions were sometimes the consequence of hastily written scripts, of which there was not always enough time or money to shoot every scene. In Criss Cross, Siodmak achieved these effects with purpose, wrapping them around Yvonne De Carlo, playing the most understandable of femme fatales; Dan Duryea, in one of his many charismatic villain roles; and Lancaster as an ordinary laborer turned armed robber, doomed by a romantic obsession.|$|E

Another problem was high altitude EMP (whether from offensive or defensive nuclear warheads) which could degrade defensive radar systems.|$|R

Vulpea's life and deeds had <b>already</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> mark on literature and the theater, beginning in 1818 with the comedy Generalul Ghica, possibly written by Costache Faca. It shows Vulpea as a sex symbol, with Sultana Ghica swooning over his portrait. Vulpea was also an unseen character in an unpublished play by his former colleague Iordache Golescu, which romanticizes his encounter with Vladimirescu. Ion Ghica also relayed fictionalized anecdotes about Vulpea as the protector of barbers and the object of adulation by the clinically insane.|$|E
25|$|Polybia sericea are {{generally}} docile wasps, {{and will not}} attack other organisms unless they are stimulated. When they are attacked, however, they may chase predators up to 15 meters away from the nest. In addition they may sting and bite the predator. The magnitude of a defense response {{is proportional to the}} energetic investment by the colony in rearing individuals, and also {{to the size of the}} colony. More individuals are likely to attack a predator if there are more adults, eggs, larvae, and pupae in the nest, because the colony has <b>already</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> large investment in developing itself. Polybia sericea relies upon active defense to defend their nest from ants, whereas other species produce glandular secretions that act as ant repellant to deter ants from entering the nest.|$|E
25|$|Cecil Gardner had <b>already</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> {{name for}} himself {{manufacturing}} radio sets, recharging accumulators and ac/dc transformers from a small factory in Southbourne; when in 1939 he moved into a purpose built factory in Somerford Road, Christchurch. He soon had plenty of business making transformers for American pilots who needed to convert the British 240 volt supply to the 110 volt they were using, and lighting transformers for air raid shelters. Gardner's also won contracts with the Telecommunications Research Establishment and the Ministry of Aircraft Production. After the war, contracts from the Admiralty and the Atomic Energy Research Establishment allowed the business to grow and Gardner's were soon employing around 300 people. Gardner's contributed to the local economy {{not just because it}} was a major employer but also because it attracted others to the area such as Penny and Giles (potentiometers) and Plessey Defence Systems who came {{to take advantage of the}} local skilled workforce. The factory closed in the late 1990s partly due to an increase in cheap imports.|$|E

Later, Tyler was an elected delegate to the Virginia convention called to consider whether or not to follow the Deep South states out of the Union. Tyler thought that a final collective effort should be made to preserve the Union and in a document published on January 17, 1861, he called for a convention of the six free and six slave border states to resolve the sectional split. Governor John Letcher of Virginia had <b>already</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> similar request to the state legislature, agreed to sponsor the convention while the list of attendees to all of the states was expanded.

The Galicians asked Ryurik Rostislavich for his son Rostislav Ryurikovich, but Roman rode to Duke Leszek I of Poland (1194–1227), promising to be at his beck and call if the Polish ruler helped him to win Halych. When the citizens refused to welcome Roman, Duke Leszek I besieged the town, and after capturing it, he forced the townspeople to accept Roman as prince. Roman promised to be subservient to the duke of Poland and to live in peace with his new subjects.|$|E

It remained a toll bridge until 1903, after an Eton man named Joseph Taylor, who had <b>already</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> successful legal challenge against the tolls on Windsor Bridge petitioned the Charity Commissioners in 1902 that the toll was illegal as the funds raised had {{been used by the}} Maidenhead Corporation for purposes other than bridge maintenance – a fact freely admitted by the town clerk.

A large crowd gathered at the bridge and in the first moments of 1 November 1903 they removed the toll gates and threw them into the Thames.
