5|$|The traffic {{projections}} for the bridge <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>planning</b> <b>stage</b> {{have not been}} achieved. A traffic survey carried out for a week during June 2012 recorded traffic of 29,000 vehicles over the bridge in comparison to a projected 85,000. A survey conducted {{during the same period}} in June 2012 indicated a figure of 31,865 vehicles, though it is reported by the concerned traffic and transportation engineer that the rate of increase in traffic has been one percent per year on the basis of traffic surveys carried out from the time of commissioning of the bridge. The reason for the fall in traffic during 2012 is attributed to the peak monsoon effect during the survey period.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{construction}} industry is still plagued by poor quality, poor workmanship, poor {{safety and health}} environment, and poor practices. The current main problem in the Malaysian Construction Industry is delayed projects under <b>the</b> Ninth Malaysia <b>Plan.</b> <b>The</b> idea of introducing formal risk assessment among Malaysian contractors during <b>the</b> project <b>planning</b> <b>stage</b> is a proactive approach to achieve project objectives. Therefore, this research intends to achieve the following objectives: (1) to investigate the contractors’ approaches of risk assessment techniques <b>at</b> <b>the</b> project <b>planning</b> <b>stage,</b> (2) to investigate the consequences of risk assessment techniques <b>at</b> <b>the</b> project <b>planning</b> <b>stage,</b> and (3) to determine the appropriate risk assessment techniques {{in dealing with the}} potential risk factors <b>at</b> <b>the</b> project <b>planning</b> <b>stage.</b> <b>The</b> research methodology applied for this research includes literature reviews and questionnaires. Findings from this research show that the application of risk assessment techniques in the Malaysian Construction Industry is still moderate. Hence, it is suggested that these contractors should try to implement formal risk assessment techniques during <b>the</b> project <b>planning</b> <b>stage</b> in order to achieve the project objectives. ...|$|R

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) helps facilitate pre-departure medical screening, counselling, dossier preparation, transport and immediate arrival assistance. Once in the UK, refugees are entered into a 12-month support programme intended to aid their integration.

40|$|Abstract — Dimensional {{and form}} {{deviations}} {{that arise in}} CNC turned components due to cutting forces and thermal effects have been traditionally compensated by on-line corrections {{even when they were}} not strictly necessary. Machine-tools equipped with multiple sensors must be utilized in order to carry out these compensations what in turn leads to an increment in production costs, the occurrence of undesirable effects such as chatter as well as moving away from optimal conditions. A new approach is proposed in this work for prediction and compensation of deviations in turning by taking them into account <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>planning</b> <b>stages</b> prior to machining operations. The proposed model determines the admissible value of deviations in accordance to tolerance limits within the workpiece and utilizes them for setting up the appropriate operation conditions. Initial experimental steps for validating these deviation models are also described...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Minimization {{of power}} {{consumption}} {{is a critical}} design goal for wireless-relay networks comprised of battery-powered sensor devices. In the paper, we consider a source-initiated (one-to-all) broadcast scenario in wirelessly-relay sensor networks (WSNs) with a high delivery probability requirement. We analyze both the transmission and the reception power to gain insights into the optimization of the overall power consumption of WSNs at network <b>planning</b> <b>stage.</b> Specifically, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> network <b>planning</b> <b>stage,</b> one wishes to maximize the network lifetime of the network through a proper selection of three key design parameters including the transmission range, the sleep period, and the broadcast probability. As a rule of thumb, the optimal number of nodes awaken to broadcast messages within a transmission range is constant with a given network size and path loss exponent for a target delivery probability requirement. Given the optimal settings above, we also present the trade-off between the delay requirement and power consumption. Our results can serve as general guidelines <b>at</b> <b>the</b> network <b>planning</b> <b>stage.</b> ...|$|R
