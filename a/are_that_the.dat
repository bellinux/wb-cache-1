5|$|As {{shown in}} the table, {{the total number of}} {{possible}} combinations to have an equal (conserved) number of A and B alleles is six, and its probability is 6/16. The total number of possible alternative combinations is ten, and the probability of unequal number of A and B alleles is 10/16. Thus, although the original colony began with an equal number of A and B alleles, chances <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number of alleles in the remaining population of four members will not be equal. In the latter case, genetic drift has occurred because the population's allele frequencies have changed due to random sampling. In this example the population contracted to just four random survivors, a phenomenon known as population bottleneck.|$|E
5|$|Both {{before the}} {{establishment}} of Australia Day as the national day of Australia, and {{in the years after}} its creation, several dates have been proposed for its celebration and, at various times, the possibility of moving Australia Day to an alternative date has been mooted. Some reasons put forward <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> current date, celebrating the foundation of the Colony of New South Wales, lacks national significance; that the day falls on school holidays which limits the engagement of schoolchildren in the event; and that it fails to encompass members of the indigenous community and some others who perceive the day as commemorating the date of an invasion of their land. Connected to this is the suggestion that moving the date would be seen as a significant symbolic act.|$|E

5|$|Matheos {{suggested}} {{using an}} altered {{version of the}} United States passport for the album's cover art.

5|$|Other {{differences}} between the principal and secondary eyes <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> latter have rhabdomeres that point away from incoming light, just like in vertebrates, while the arrangement is the opposite in the former.

5|$|Recently, however, {{scholars}} such as David Christian and Constantine Zuckerman {{have suggested}} that the Schechter Letter's account is corroborated by various other Russian chronicles, and suggests a struggle within the early Rus' polity between factions loyal to Oleg and to the Rurikid Igor, a struggle that Oleg ultimately lost. Zuckerman posited that the early chronology of the Rus' had to be re-determined in light of these sources. Among Zuckerman's beliefs and those of others who have analyzed these sources <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Khazars did not lose Kiev until the early 10th century (rather than 882, the traditional date), that Igor was not Rurik's son but rather a more distant descendant, and that Oleg did not immediately follow Rurik, but rather that there is a lost generation between the legendary Varangian lord and his documented successors.|$|E
40|$|A {{generalized}} gradient projection filter algorithm for inequality constrained optimization is presented.

5|$|Some of {{the more}} unusual {{proposals}} <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Eskaya people are a Semitic proto-Christian tribe; that they possess the lost book of Enoch; that they are descended from the builders of King Solomon's temple; that their existence proves the imminence of a second Messiah in Bohol; or that they guard esoteric secrets.|$|E
5|$|The main {{disadvantage}} to {{die casting}} {{is the very}} high capital cost. Both the casting equipment required and the dies and related components are very costly, as compared to most other casting processes. Therefore, to make die casting an economic process, a large production volume is needed. Other disadvantages <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> process is limited to high-fluidity metals, and casting weights must be between 30grams (1oz) and 10kg (20lb). In the standard die casting process the final casting will have {{a small amount of}} porosity. This prevents any heat treating or welding, because the heat causes the gas in the pores to expand, which causes micro-cracks inside the part and exfoliation of the surface. Thus a related disadvantage of die casting is that it is only for parts in which softness is acceptable. Parts needing hardening (through hardening or case hardening) and tempering are not cast in dies.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} raised {{criticism}} against several fundamental shortcomings in the network system. The most fundamental {{is the lack of}} indoor coverage. This has in part been reversed by increasing the signal strength in urban areas and installing repeaters at for instance medical clinics, Oslo Courthouse and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Other shortcomings <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> location of base stations are publicly know, allowing for easy sabotage and increased investment costs because of the choice of the proprietary TEDS instead of the open ETSI system.|$|E
30|$|However, VCO 2 -based {{calorimetry}} has two methodological challenges. <b>The</b> first <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> method {{requires a}} choice of RQ to be made, and <b>the</b> second <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> accuracy of the estimation is affected by instant variability in measurements of MV and VCO 2.|$|R
50|$|A police lineup is {{a method}} for an {{eyewitness}} to identify a perpetrator by viewing a series of photos, or a live group of suspects. One possible outcome of a lineup <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> eyewitness can correctly identify the criminal. Another outcome <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> eyewitness can correctly state <b>that</b> <b>the</b> criminal <b>is</b> not in the lineup. A third option <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> eyewitness can fail to recognize <b>that</b> <b>the</b> culprit <b>is</b> present. Lastly, the eyewitness can incorrectly select another suspect. The ideal result is to correctly identify the offender, and the worst outcome is to mistakenly identify an innocent.|$|R
30|$|The {{advantage}} of DS theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> evidence can <b>be</b> associated with multiple possible events, for example, sets of events.

5|$|Before the Tang Dynasty (618907 AD), the {{predominant}} sitting {{positions in the}} Han Chinese culture and neighboring cultures such as the Japanese Culture, Korean Culture, Turkic Culture in Central Asia and Tai Kadai Cultures to the southwest were the seiza and lotus position on the floor or sitting mats. The earliest images of chairs in China are from sixth-century Buddhist murals and stele, but the practice of sitting in chairs {{at that time was}} rare. It was not until the twelfth century that chairs became widespread in China. Scholars disagree on the reasons for the adoption of the chair. The most common theories <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> chair was an outgrowth of indigenous Chinese furniture, that it evolved from a camp stool imported from Central Asia, that it was introduced to China by Nestorian missionaries in the seventh century, and that the chair came to China from India as a form of Buddhist monastic furniture. In modern China, unlike Korea or Japan, it is not common to sit at floor level.|$|E
5|$|Isolation {{manifolded}} twin sets or manifolded doubles {{with two}} regulators, consist of two back mounted cylinders with their pillar valves {{connected by a}} manifold, with a valve in the manifold that can be closed to isolate the two pillar valves. In {{the event of a}} problem with one cylinder the diver may close the isolator valve to preserve gas in the cylinder which has not failed. The advantages of this configuration include: a larger gas supply than from a single cylinder; automatic balancing of the gas supply between the two cylinders; thus, no requirement to constantly change regulators underwater during the dive; and in most failure situations, the diver may close a valve to a failed regulator or isolate a cylinder and may retain access to all the remaining gas in both the tanks. The disadvantages <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> manifold is another potential point of failure, and there is a danger of losing all gas from both cylinders if the isolation valve cannot be closed when a problem occurs. This configuration of cylinders is often used in technical diving.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} the 1845 Bill {{submission}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> preamble <b>was</b> proved but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Committee stage in the House of Lords rejected the Bill: this meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> desirability of the line <b>was</b> accepted, but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> detail of Moorsom's design was considered unsafe.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{complication}} of AC circuits <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> resistance and conductance can be frequency-dependent.

40|$|It <b>was</b> {{observed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> p-mode power <b>is</b> substantially suppressed in magnetic regions.

A related possibility <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> attenuation length scale in the evanescent region is reduced {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field. It <b>is</b> likely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> observations sample a different position in the evanescent tails of the eigenfunctions in magnetic regions because of different temperature structures in these regions.

5|$|The Act was {{implemented}} by the NRA and the Public Works Administration (PWA). Very large numbers of regulations were generated under the authority granted to the NRA by the Act, {{which led to a}} significant loss of political support for Roosevelt and the New Deal. The NIRA was set to expire in June 1935, but in a major constitutional ruling the U.S. Supreme Court held Title I of the Act unconstitutional on May 27, 1935, in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935). The National Industrial Recovery Act is widely considered a policy failure, both in the 1930s and by historians today. Disputes over the reasons for this failure continue. Among the suggested causes <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Act promoted economically harmful monopolies, that the Act lacked critical support from the business community, and that it was poorly administered. The Act encouraged union organizing, which led to significant labor unrest. The NIRA had no mechanisms for handling these problems, which led Congress to pass the National Labor Relations Act in 1935. The Act was also a major force behind a major modification of the law criminalizing making false statements.|$|E
5|$|The PC {{version of}} Worms Armageddon was {{critically}} successful. Whilst writing that veterans of Worms 2 {{would find the}} game to be similar, Greg Kasavin of GameSpot praised the game for being easy to play and control and humorous and the game's graphics, physics, and seemingly endless customization {{as well as the}} game's WormNet. He also likened the single-player missions to the classic game of Lemmings in that the missions often required the player to precisely utilize a limited supply of weapons and tools to accomplish the objective. Among his only criticisms <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> AI-controlled worms do not utilize their full arsenals and that the player would wish that there were more weapons, more diverse graphics and sound, and more content. Matthew Pierce of PC Gamer UK commended Team17 for addressing the problems of single-player (i.e. the missions and AI) that the original Worms and Worms 2 had always been criticized for.|$|E

30|$|One {{reason of}} these {{increases}} might <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> impact of FTO substrate samples {{on the environment}} is reduced, in which the process was in a nitrogen-filled glovebox while the reported process was in the air. The second reason might <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> resistivity of the ITO substrate increases after annealing treatment at high temperature while the resistivity of the FTO substrate does not. For ITO, the oxygen hole as carrier reduction causes the decrease of conductivity after annealing.
