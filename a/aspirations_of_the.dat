5|$|From {{the middle}} of the 14th century, Bulgaria fell prey to the <b>aspirations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Angevin king Louis I of Hungary, who annexed Moldavia in 1352 and {{established}} a vassal principality there, before conquering Vidin in 1365, and taking Ivan Sratsimir and his family into captivity.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, Hellenic Nomarchy {{points to}} the ongoing {{successful}} struggle of the Serbs against the Ottoman rule, which began in 1804. The author states that the Orthodox clergy was holding back the national <b>aspirations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek people, while the educated and dynamic elements of Greek society and the mercantile diaspora should return to Greece and join the movement of national liberation.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} <b>aspirations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Partisan movement were {{reflected in}} the State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Croatia, which developed in 1943 as the bearer of Croatian statehood and later transformed into the Parliament of Croatia in 1945, and AVNOJ—its counterpart at the Yugoslav level.|$|E

30|$|An {{important}} finding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{study is}} that the interventions had {{a positive impact on}} <b>the</b> entrepreneur identity <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants. The interventions {{had a significant impact on}} the relationships among the various constructs and that led to a positive relationship among them. How thoroughly the participants explored their business ideas had a positive impact on their psychological characteristics and intellectual capital. Entrepreneurial skills were found to be positively impacted by better psychological characteristics, thoroughly explored business plans, and higher intellectual capital. Higher entrepreneurial skills ultimately had a positive impact on <b>the</b> entrepreneur identity <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants.|$|R
25|$|In most {{varieties}} of Chinese {{that have lost}} <b>the</b> voicing <b>of</b> Middle Chinese initials, <b>the</b> <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resulting initials is conditioned by tone, though the relationship varies between dialect groups.|$|R
5|$|Haywood {{observed}} {{how the government}} frequently took the side of business to defeat the tactics and the <b>aspirations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> miners. During an 1899 organizing drive in Coeur d'Alene, with pay cuts as a motivating issue, the company hired spies and then fired organizers and pro-union miners. Some frustrated miners responded with violence and when two men were killed, martial law was declared. As they had done in a strike in Coeur d'Alene seven years earlier, soldiers acted as strike breakers. They rounded up hundreds of union members without formal charges {{and put them in}} a filthy, vermin-infested warehouse without sanitation services for a year. They were so crowded that the soldiers locked the overflow of prisoners in boxcars. One local union leader was imprisoned for 17 years.|$|E
5|$|The rigors {{and rewards}} of pioneer {{life on the}} prairie {{are the subject of}} Giants in the Earth by Ole Rolvaag and the Little House series of children's books by Laura Ingalls Wilder. Small-town life is portrayed grimly by Sinclair Lewis in the novel Main Street, and more gently and affectionately by Garrison Keillor in his tales of Lake Wobegon. St. Paul native F. Scott Fitzgerald writes of the social insecurities and <b>aspirations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young city in stories such as Winter Dreams and The Ice Palace (published in Flappers and Philosophers). Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's epic poem The Song of Hiawatha was {{inspired}} by Minnesota and names many of the state's places and bodies of water. Minnesota native Robert Zimmerman (Bob Dylan) won the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature.|$|E
25|$|Aspire {{stands for}} the <b>aspirations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city and people of Nottingham. Aspire {{stands for the}} ambition, {{knowledge}} and world leading innovation of The University of Nottingham. Above all, Aspire stands as a towering affirmation of optimism for the future.|$|E
30|$|Shapero and Sokol (1982), Krueger et al. (2000), and Boissin and Emin (2007) {{state that}} the {{personality}} characteristics and demographic variables take an indirect route in order to explain entrepreneurial intentions and do not directly explain it. This is what we conclude as well that psychological characteristics positively impact entrepreneurial skills and then entrepreneurial skills impact <b>the</b> entrepreneur identity <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants. Thus, psychological characteristics do impact entrepreneur identity <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants however that is done through entrepreneurial kills. Furthermore, 5 personality dimensions out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 6 incorporated in the study are positively related to entrepreneurial intentions (Zhao et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|Child {{support is}} a private transfer, which for many people is {{mediated}} by the government, and which mainly benefits lone parents. Children in lone parent families represented 42 per cent of all poor children in 2003 / 4. Therefore child support might play {{an important part in}} reducing child poverty. Although this was not an <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1991 Child Support Act it was certainly <b>the</b> main <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000. This paper is a review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potential <b>of</b> child support in the strategy to end child poverty...|$|R

25|$|There {{are several}} cases where an {{adjective}} or intransitive verb beginning with an unaspirated voiced stop is {{paired with a}} transitive verb differing only in <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voiced stop, suggesting that the contrast reflects an early morphological process.|$|R
25|$|In {{the largely}} {{superseded}} Wade–Giles romanization for Standard Chinese, an apostrophe marks <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preceding consonant sound.

25|$|But the MIC under Sambanthan Thevar {{failed to}} {{reconcile}} the needs of labour with the political <b>aspirations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle class. The traditionalists and the lower middle class strengthened their hold within the party, while the upper class professionals and the intelligentsia moved away from it. Subsequently, two paths to leadership emerged among the Indians – political and trade union – with very little interaction between them.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 the Society {{adopted a}} new {{constitution}} retaining the spirit of its original objectives, but reflecting the current needs and <b>aspirations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city and in 2008 the society became the first civic society in the United Kingdom to receive a grant of arms which included a coat of arms and Crest for the sole use of the society and its Officers and a badge to be worn by members.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} university's {{expansion}} in the 1990s, Monash took over {{the operations of the}} Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education in 1990. The commitment to regional higher education {{on the part of the}} university was a progressive and bold step, however, the operation of the Gippsland campus was always fraught with some tension between the priorities of the metropolitan-centred campuses at Clayton and Caulfield versus the needs and <b>aspirations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regional one.|$|E

50|$|A broad {{spectrum}} cephalosporin and meropenem {{are often used}} because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> good penetration into the central nervous system.

25|$|Upon {{his death}} in 1910, the house passed to his daughter, Laura, and the woman he married after her mother had died. After her {{stepmother}} died in 1924, Laura began to spend more of her time at {{a house in the}} nearby village, reflecting the completion of the early <b>aspirations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hasbroucks and other Duzine members. She sold half of the remaining land for houses after Route 32 was built through the property in the late 1920s.|$|E
25|$|Built under strict {{construction}} regulations and intended for well-off 'curists', that is, those attending the spa facilities, {{the idea of}} a residential area right {{in the heart of the}} Normandy forest attracted a very wealthy clientele.

25|$|After {{leaving office}} in December 2002, Moi lived in retirement, largely shunned by the {{political}} establishment. However, he still retained some popularity with the masses, and his presence never failed to gather a crowd. He spoke out against {{a proposal for a}} new constitution in 2005; according to Moi, the document was contrary to the <b>aspirations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kenyan people. After the proposal was defeated in a November 2005 constitutional referendum, President Kibaki called President Moi to arrange for a meeting to discuss the way forward.|$|E

40|$|A 65 -year-old man was {{referred}} to the Gastroenterology Department with complaints of longstanding upper abdominal discomfort and hepatomegaly. Ultrasound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liver revealed a massively enlarged liver with multiple cystic areas. <b>Aspiration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest cyst revealed 15 ml of yellow fluid without any organisms or malignant cells. A diagnosis of autosomal- dominant polycystic kidney disease was suspected, but could not initially be confirmed on ultrasound/ computed tomography imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the multiple hepatic cysts and revealed multiple smaller cysts in both kidneys. Symptomatology subsided after <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest cyst and the patient was discharged. The patient has subsequently been followed up and is currently symptom free.

25|$|The black eagle was {{originally}} {{the seal of}} King Sancho VII of Navarre but was later attributed to Sancho III of Navarre who, when incorporating Aragon and Castile, had under his crown all the territories of Basque culture and language, including those traditionally Castilian, since his kingdom reached from Galicia to Ribagorza. From a Basque nationalist interpretation, the rule of Sancho III constitutes a historical precedent for the <b>aspirations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unification of the Basque-speaking territories under one independent State.
