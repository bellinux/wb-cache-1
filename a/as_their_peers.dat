25|$|Students {{from each}} house enter into annual {{competitions}} in sport, music and drama versus the other houses, where pupils represent their house. Examples {{of these are}} the house netball, house football, house rugby, house lacrosse, house hockey, house tennis, house rounders, house dance, house choir, house instrumental, and many others. There are also house plays which are written by year 12 students (aged 16 and 17) and performed by year 10 students (aged 14 and 15). The winning house in each competition is awarded {{a certain number of}} points, which are accrued during the academic year. The house with the most points {{at the end of the}} year will win the House Championship. Junior/Senior House Colour Awards, in the form of ties, are awarded at the end of Years 10 and/or 12 to students who excel in a certain field, either academic or extracurricular. The ties are distinct from the normal school tie, consisting solely of the colour of the wearer's house. Girls were once given sashes instead of ties but this practice fell out of favour with the students and so they were awarded ties just <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers</b> were.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, a study {{ordered by}} Congress found that middle school {{students}} {{who took part in}} abstinence-only sex education programs were just as likely to have sex in their teenage years as those who did not. From 1999 to 2006, the study tracked more than 2,000 students from age 11 or 12 to age 16; the study included students who had participated in one of four abstinence education programs, as well as a control group who had not participated in such a program. By age 16, about half of each group students in the abstinence-only program as well as students in the control group were still abstinent. Abstinence program participants who became sexually active during the 7-year study period reported having similar numbers of sexual partners <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers</b> of the same age; moreover, they had sex {{for the first time at}} about the same age as other students. The study also found that students who took part in the abstinence-only programs were just as likely to use contraception when they did have sex as those who did not participate. Abstinence-only education advocates claim the study was too narrow, began when abstinence-only curricula were in their infancy, and ignored other studies that have shown positive effects.|$|E
500|$|Despite record {{statistics}} and three straight championship game appearances, Tittle {{was never able}} to deliver a title to his team. His record as a starter in postseason games was 0–4. He threw four touchdown passes against 14 interceptions and had a passer rating of 33.8 in his postseason career, far below his regular season passer rating of 74.3. Seth Wickersham, writing for ESPN The Magazine in 2014, noted the dichotomy in the 1960s between two of New York's major sports franchises: [...] "...Gifford, Huff and Tittle, a team of Hall of Famers known for losing championships <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers</b> on the Yankees—with whom they shared a stadium, a city, and many rounds of drinks—became renowned for winning them." [...] The Giants struggled after Tittle's retirement, posting only two winning seasons from 1964 to 1980.|$|E

500|$|One of the {{political}} impacts of the massive infusion into the South Vietnamese economy was to expand the urban middle-class and ease {{the pressure on the}} government to collect taxes. This was because the government had set high import duties, which were effectively 50% of the cut-price exchange rate used under the CIP; these funds were also part of normal revenue, and were not subject to American oversight, unlike the proceeds of the counterpart fund. As a result of the proceeds of the import duty, income tax was very low, and without the progressive income tax rate in most countries, the upper-class were not affected by taxation as much <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers</b> in other nations, and thus supported Diem strongly. The effective income taxation rate was no more than 5%, and the South Vietnamese president privately told an adviser from the Michigan State University Group that he was happy that the CIP had allowed him to build a large support base among the newly created middle and upper class. American economic aid administrators were also aware {{of the effects of the}} CIP on urban political support for Diem and his successors. They were aware that the CIP had not been yielding substantial gains in economic development, and noted this in their reports, but said that the program should be continued regardless, as it was effective in enriching the urban middle class and ensuring their political support, thereby gaining loyalty from military officers, business leaders and public servants. A 1959 report concluded that if the CIP was absent or diluted to equilibrium economic levels, the resulting fall in living standards would create [...] "serious political problems" [...] due to erosion of the government's support among the urban minority.|$|E

Children in such families do as well emotionally, socially and educationally <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers</b> from heterosexual couple families." [...] Maya Newell produced the documentary Gayby Baby, looking at children in same-sex relationships, with the film marketed as [...] "stirring" [...] political debate on same-sex marriage.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of cystic fibrosis are salty-tasting skin, poor growth, and poor weight gain despite normal food intake, accumulation of thick, sticky mucus, frequent chest infections, and coughing or shortness of breath. Males can be infertile due to congenital absence of the vas deferens. Symptoms often appear in infancy and childhood, such as bowel obstruction due to meconium ileus in newborn babies. As the children grow, they [...] exercise to release mucus in the alveoli. Ciliated epithelial cells in the person have a mutated protein that leads to abnormally viscous mucus production. The poor growth in children typically presents as an inability to gain weight or height at the same rate <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers,</b> and is occasionally not diagnosed until investigation is initiated for poor growth. The causes of growth failure are multifactorial and include chronic lung infection, poor absorption of nutrients through the gastrointestinal tract, and increased metabolic demand due to chronic illness.|$|E
2500|$|The leading {{motif of}} Torquemada's monumental history – {{elaborated}} by him in many places, {{especially in the}} general prologue to the entire work – can be characterised as the merciful action of Divine Providence in choosing the Spanish to liberate the Indians from their subjection to the Devil who had deceived these innocent peoples into practising a religion marred by errors and polluted by abominations such as human sacrifice. [...] On this interpretation {{the fall of the}} Aztec monarchy was a Divine chastisement and Spain the rod. But, for all that, Torquemada was sympathetic to the positive achievements of the Indians, and, by situating their history and culture {{within the framework of the}} Old Testament and of the former glories of the empires of Egypt, Greece and Rome, he encouraged the educated elite of the Old World to recognise the indigenous nations of the New World <b>as</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers.</b> [...] His history was, of set purpose, a laborious inquiry into the truth of things, requiring (as he says in his general prologue) diligence, maturation, and the exercise of prudence in adjudicating among conflicting testimonies. [...] It was not written as an entertainment or to satisfy mere curiosity, but with a serious didactic purpose and to edify, for he believed that the record of the events of the past constitute not only an antidote to human mortality and the brevity of life, but also a hermeneutic key to understanding the present, thereby offering man an opportunity to progress.|$|E
