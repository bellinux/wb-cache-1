40|$|Photo missing pg 98 - {{no other}} copyThe {{fertility}} cycle is an inherent feature of pasture production. The animal grazes the pasture, retains the digestible energy and {{small amounts of}} the plant nutrients it requires and returns the remainder to the sward as excreta. The pasture may then use the nutrients in the excreta for further growth. In countries such as New Zealand where the animals graze the pasture all the year round the fertility cycle remains intact. The <b>animals</b> <b>excreta</b> is deposited as discrete dung and urine patches on virtually the same pasture from which it was derived, where it is immediately subjected to an environment responsible for its decay and incorporation into the soil. This fertility cycle is broken, however, in countries where the animal is fed indoors {{for part of the}} year. Under this system of management, the excreta becomes mixed with the bedding material of the stalls in which the animals are housed. The mixture, commonly termed "farmyard manure", is eventually redistributed back onto the pasture or mixed with the soil as a manure for crops. Also while in the stalls, the animals are fed meal and conserved fodder which may not necessarily have been grown on land to which the "farmyard manure" is returned. Consequently, although many experiments have been conducted overseas with "farmyard manure", the results have very little relevance to the situation as it exists in New Zealand...|$|R

The most important gases related to animal production are: ammonia, carbon dioxine and hydrogen sulphide. Knowledge about gas release from the manure and behaviour in fron of disturbances is important to develop technologies to ensure farm safety and reduce emissions of pollutant compounds. In this thesis, behaviours of ammonia, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide are studied when the slurry is disturbed under different airflow rates and different initial pH manure. How the pH was affected by slurry disturbances, changes on pH surface and how it was influenced by the airflow conditions was aldo investigated by measuring the pH at three different depths (0. 5 to 1, 4 and 6 cm) and three different positions (at locations were the disturbance was created (average from the two holes), and in the middle of the slurry surface (were not active disturbance was created). The effect of acidification and the crust formation on the ammonia, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide emissions was also studied. Two types of slurry were investigated to evaluate the effect of ageing. As in a farm the slurry surface can be frequently altered by the addition of new slurry (<b>animal's</b> <b>excreta),</b> cleaning water from the washing processes or slurry mixing during emptying the manure pit; an analysis of how the emission increased in these transient periods and the risks that this could suppose for the workers and the animals...|$|R

When studying short-term changes in Q, the size of the respiration chamber in relation to the subject of study is a point of concern. The washout time of a chamber, defined as the proportion of the chamber size to the rate of ventilation, needs to be minimised for accurate measurement of short term changes in Q. To date, most respiration chambers have a fixed size, limiting their use for different species, sizes and number of subjects, thus hampering studying the short term dynamics of Q. This chapter presents various approaches to the design, construction and testing of respiration chambers, adjustable to the metabolic mass inside. As investment costs for constructing respiration chambers are high, flexibility in the use of chambers can contribute substantially to an efficient use of resources. Furthermore, an outline is given to sensor criteria and calibration and finally, the validation of a whole indirect-calorimetric system is described. Air leak tolerance is defined and attention is paid to caretaking of <b>animals,</b> <b>excreta</b> collection and <b>animal</b> and personnel welfare and safety. Respiration facilities, recently constructed at Wageningen University are presented as an example. Briefly, four 45 m 2 climate chambers can be used, e. g. for heat or cold stress experiments, to incubate eggs or as a hygiene barrier. Within each chamber, one or two smaller airtight, size adaptable respiration rooms, can be built in where ambient temperature, humidity and ventilation rate can be controlled independently. In each respiration room a wide range of ventilation flow rates can be accomplished and both hypobaric and hyperbaric air pressure control can be established, allowing energy metabolism experiments with specific pathogen free animals (hyperbaric) or trials with infectious agents (hypobaric) ...|$|R

Several organizations offer analytical services to test sentinel <b>animals</b> or <b>excreta</b> for contamination with defined microorganisms. Before exchanging animals between facilities, the health certificates need to be exchanged, and only if the receiving facility’s negative list of pathogens is tested negative over a defined time period in the source facility/facilities, the animals can be transferred. Alternatively, and if infrastructure and risk assessment allow, rooms with differing hygiene levels or quarantine rooms can be defined and common instruments cleaned and decontaminated accordingly. However, it should be kept in mind that any infection or its treatment could affect the imaging results.|$|R

40|$|In {{areas with}} dense populations of <b>animals,</b> the <b>excreta</b> cause major {{environmental}} problems. Nitrogen is often excreted in too high amounts. High water contents in animal slurry increase {{the costs of}} transport and processing. The objective of the experiments was to evaluate the effects of reduced dietary protein contents on dry matter and nitrogen in the excreta of growing pigs, {{as well as to}} study the effect of age on water intake, urine production and nitrogen utilization. Growing pigs, weighing between 20 and 70 kg, were housed in metabolism cages and allowed free access to feed and water. The diet contained 12. 9 % of crude protein and was supplemented with l-lysine, dl-methionine, l-threonine and l-tryptophan. The ratio between water and feed intake was 1. 43 and was almost constant throughout the experimental period. Urine production, when compared with intake of drinking water, was initially 33 % and increased up to 44 % when the animals reached 70 kg. Nitrogen utilization diminished with age from 62. 9 % to 49. 2 %. In the second trial three diets containing 18. 5 %, 16. 3 % and 12. 9 % of crude protein were fed ad libitum to fattening pigs (70 - 85 kg), which were also maintained in metabolism cages. Reduction of the crude protein content from 18. 5 % to 12. 9 % resulted in a 21 % lower water intake and increased the dry matter content of the excreta (faeces + urine) from 11. 7 % to 17. 1 %; nitrogen excretion was lowered by 39. 2 %. Taking into account that in practical conditions fattening diets contain approximately 16 % of crude protein and that extra water is added to the excreta, it could be calculated that the dietary protein reduction to 12. 9 % would eventually result in a relative increase of the dry matter content of the manure by 14. 7 %. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of pathogen and host relationships relative to disease transmission in wildlife populations are important ecological processes to understand, particularly since spatial {{dynamics of}} disease can {{be driven by}} movement, behavior, and dispersal of animals. Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) {{is an example of}} this important interface, where little is known regarding origin of the disease or routes of transmission. Surveillance data for CWD in free-ranging mule deer indicates that breeding-age male deer have 2 - 4 times higher prevalence rates than females or younger age males. In an effort to understand differences that might increase risk for exposure to CWD infective agents, I used GPS data to examine breeding behavior and home range sizes of mule 11 deer. GPS radiocollars were placed on adult (3 ̆e 2 ½ years) males, females, and young (3 ̆c 2 ½ years) males. Data collected during the breeding season was used to infer visitation rates of males to females. Cluster analysis was used to separate data into periods of movement (spatio-temporal clusters) and non-movement. Females formed more spatio-temporal clusters and movement paths than males. However, males spent more time moving, had more long-term periods of movement, moved an estimated 1 km/day more than females, and had more tortuous movement paths. Male home ranges for winter, summer, and breeding seasons were also larger than those of females. Overall, data indicates that males may have an increased risk of exposure to CWD relative to females, because of larger movements and greater space use. These male behavioral differences may result in increased encounter rates with CWD infectious material through greater exposure in the environment to sources such as carcasses from infected <b>animals,</b> their <b>excreta,</b> or contaminated soils. Furthermore, during the breeding season increased male sociality, as suggested by increased movement rates and movement path tortuousity, combined with larger space use may further enhance direct contact with infected individuals and increase exposure to excreta sources such as feces and alimentary secretions due to licking and tending behaviors...|$|R

The study objective was to assess risk factors of E. histolytica infection in a community in Vietnam, where wastewater and human excreta are used in agriculture. A case-control study was conducted among residents of Hanam province, Northern Vietnam. Cases (n = 46) infected with E. histolytica and non-infected controls (n = 138) were identified in a cross-sectional survey among 794 randomly selected individuals and matched for age, sex and place of residence. Potential risk factors including exposure to human and <b>animal</b> <b>excreta</b> and household wastewater were assessed with a questionnaire. Results People from households with an average socio-economic status had a much higher risk of E. histolytica infection (odds ratio [OR]= 4. 3, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 3 - 14. 0) compared with those from households with a good socioeconomic status. Those individuals who never or rarely used soap for hand washing had a 3. 4 times higher risk for infection (OR= 3. 4, 95 % CI: 1. 1 - 10. 0), {{compared to those who}} used always soap. In contrast, none of the factors related to use of human or <b>animal</b> <b>excreta</b> was statistically significant associated with E. histolytica infection. People having close contact with domestic animals presented a greater risk of E. histolytica infection (OR = 5. 9, 95 % CI: 1. 8 - 19. 0) than those without animal contact. E. histolytica infection was not associated with direct contact with Nhue river water, pond water and household's sanitary conditions, type of latrine or water source used.

These methods were compared using routine samples in the animal nutrition laboratory (concentrates, forages, excreta and duodenal content). NO 3 -N covariate interfered on total N determination according to the procedure used. A significant correlation for crude protein (CP) content was observed between methods used for each group: grass silage component, Kjeldahl-N = 1. 1661 + 0. 9216 Dumas-N (R 2 = 0. 99); energy feeds, Kjeldahl-N = 0. 6376 + 0. 9445 Dumas-N (R 2 = 0. 72) and protein feeds, Kjeldahl-N = 6. 5638 + 0. 8615 Dumas-N (R 2 = 0. 97). Means for total N contents from components, adjusted by covariance, were not different (P> 0. 05) between both methods. Considering that the standard deviation for N content obtained by the two methods stayed within the intervals observed in the literature, corroborated by the fact that Dumas combustion procedure using the analyzer LECO-FP 528 LC is not harmful to the environment it was concluded, that this method can replace with advantages the Kjeldahl procedure in routine animal nutrition N analyzes.

40|$|Many {{farmers in}} {{tropical}} and temperate countries manage {{a mix of}} crops and animals. In these systems crop residues {{can be used to}} feed the <b>animals</b> and the <b>excreta</b> from the <b>animals</b> as nutrients for the crops. Other forms of mixing take place where grazing under fruit-trees keeps the grass short, where manure from pigs is used to 'feed' fish in a pond or where young animals bred in remote areas are fattened near urban centres with high demands for meat. In addition, inclusion of livestock alters the rate of nutrient turnover, it provides a labour opportunity in slack times for crops and adds value to crop (by-) products. Livestock thus affects the socio-economic and biophysical dynamics of the entire farming system. Indeed, a wide variety of forms and processes in mixed farming are known world-wide. To different degrees they are all essential for the livelihood of farmers and for the production of food and other commodities for cities and export markets. More recently, even highly specialised crop and livestock systems in developed and developing countries have rediscovered the advantages of mixed farming.

Purposive sampling technique was used to obtain samples. Data were collected and analyzed using descriptive statistics. The analysis showed that the overall mean concentrations (mg/l) were 298. 33 TDS, 8. 0 pH, 15. 78 Na, 2. 9 K, 128. 22 CaCO, 40. 89 Ca, 6. 32 Mg, 0. 26 F, 5. 38 Cl, 0. 03 NO, 5. 68 NO, 2. 67 CO 146 alkalinity, 3 2 3 3, 172. 83 HCO, 3. 42 SO and 0. 07 boron. The pH of the water was basic, ranging from 7. 8 to 8. 2, which is within 34 the normal range for pH in surface water systems (6. 5 to 8. 5). The waters exhibited a general ionic dominance pattern of Ca > Na > Mg > K. The water was moderately hard to hard (range of hardness 80 – 170 mg/l CaCO 3) with high turbidity due to traditional farming practices, which resulted in large quantities of topsoil runoff ending up in the river after rains. Trace metal levels were low suggesting low metal contamination of the rivers. The dominance of chloride over sulphate could probably be due to domestic activities resulting from fertilizer use, household effluents and other anthropogenic point sources. The TDS varied (P 0. 05) was observed between locations. From results of this study, the microbial quality of water was observed to be poor due to direct contamination by <b>animal</b> and human <b>excreta</b> and other activities such as washing of clothes. From both livestock and human health point view, consumption of this coli- form polluted water should be avoided...|$|R
