40|$|Lake Averno is {{situated}} in the homonymous crater in the northwestern sector of the Campi Flegrei active volcanic system in Campania region, Italy. In February 2005 a fish kill event was observed in the lake, prompting a geochemical survey to ascertain the possible cause. In February 2005 a geochemical survey revealed that the lake water was unstratified chemically and isotopically, presumable, {{as a result of}} lake overturn. This fish-kill phenomenon was recorded at least two other times in the past. In contrast to the February 2005 results, data collected in October 2005, shows the Lake Averno to be stratified, with an oxic epilimnion (surface to 6 m) and an anoxic hypolimnion (6 m to lake bottom at about 33 m). Chemical and isotopic composition of Lake Averno waters suggests an origin by mixing of shallow waters with a Na-Cl hydrothermal component coupled with an active evaporation process. The isotopic composition of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon, as well as the composition of the non-reactive dissolved gas species again supports the occurrence of this mixing process. Decreasing levels of SO 4 and increasing levels of H 2 S and CH 4 contents in lake water with depth, strongly suggests anaerobic bacterial processes are occurring through decomposition of organic matter under anoxic conditions in the sediment and in the water column. Sulfate reduction and methanogenesis processes coexist and play a pivotal role in the anaerobic environment of the Lake Averno. The sulfate reducing bacterial activity has been estimated in the range of 14 - 22 μmol. m- 2. day- 1. Total gas pressure of dissolved gases ranges between 800 and 1400 mbar, well below the hydrostatic pressure throughout the water column, excluding the possibility, at least <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> <b>time,</b> of a limnic eruption. Vertical changes in the density of lake waters indicate that overturn may be triggered by cooling of epilimnetic waters below 7 °C. This is a possible phenomenon in winter periods if atmospheric temperatures remain frosty for enough time, as occurred in February 2005. The bulk of these results strongly support the hypothesis that fish kill was caused by a series of events that began with the cooling of the epilimnetic waters with breaking of the thermal stratification, followed by lake overturn and the rise of toxic levels of H 2 S from the reduced waters near the lake bottom...|$|E

30|$|Comparison of <b>the</b> job {{situation}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> two <b>survey</b> <b>times</b> {{suggests a}} strong path dependency (see Table  3). Of {{the people with}} a well-matched job in <b>the</b> first-wave <b>survey,</b> as many as 95 [*]% were still in a graduate job 4 years later (5 [*]% were in mismatched jobs).

Moreover, 89 [*]% of the formerly unemployed individuals were working 4 years later in a job that matched their education. The higher proportion of job-education mismatch among formerly non-employed graduates (compared with people who had always had a job that matched their qualifications) suggests {{that some of the}} people with no job after graduation were not in employment for the very reason that they had not (yet) found a job to match their education.|$|R

All the techniques provide time-weighted average measurements of pollutant concentrations. Tubes and dosimeters measure halothane with greater accuracy than that required by N. I. O. S.

The prototype evacuated bottles tested are unsatisfactory at their present stage of development for the measurement of both halothane and nitrous oxide concentrations.

40|$|Amid the “noise” {{created by}} {{increased}} use of computers and other technology, the ability to listen takes on increasing importance for hospitality employees. Listening is essential {{in the course of}} delivering personal, customized service. A survey of eighty-three hospitality managers found the highest agreement with the statement that effective listening is vital to business success. For hospitality organizations, that success is tightly linked to the quality of service produced by employees. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same <b>time,</b> <b>survey</b> respondents gave their lowest agreement to the statement that most members of their organization listen well. Listening is the foundation of two organizational processes essential to service delivery, one involving the accurate exchange of information and the other facilitating the development of strong relationships. Employees who are good listeners have a willingness to listen and an awareness of their own listening ability (although that may be overestimated). While developing listening competencies is not easy, it is possible for managers to improve their service employees’ listening abilities through modeling effective listening and offering training that is then augmented in the workplace—all the while improving service delivery. In addition to the rapid pace of the hospitality industry and interference from technology, one other barrier to effective listening is the diversity of employees and guests. Not only cultural differences, but also gender and age differences influence listening styles and effectiveness...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to {{longitudinally}} evaluate quality of life for pediatric patients receiving palliative care consultations and to compare patient-reported quality of life with parent perception of the child’s quality of life across wellness domains. The 23 -item PedsQL™ V 4. 0 Measurement Model was utilized for ten child and parent dyads at time of initial palliative care consultation, Month 6, and Month 12 to assess for physical, emotional, social, and cognitive dimensions of quality of life as reported independently by the child and by the parent for the child.

This study revealed overall consistency between parent- and child-reported quality of life across domains.

40|$|Background: External {{locus of}} control {{orientation}} (ELOC) is a powerful predictor of adverse consequences in regard to health, educational attainment, inter-personal relationships and well-being. Although many cross-sectional studies have been carried out, relatively {{little is known about}} antecedent factors influencing the development of ELOC. Methods: Over 12, 000 pregnant women who enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) in south-west England, had completed a brief version of the Adult Nowicki-Strickland Internal-External LOC scale, together with detailed questions concerning their own parents and childhood.  A series of hypothesis-free structured backwards stepwise logistic regression analyses used an exposome approach with ELOC as the outcome. Results: Significant positive associations were found with smoking of the parents of <b>the</b> <b>surveyed</b> women, including prenatal exposure, and their own onset of regular smoking in mid-childhood (6 - 11 years). Increased odds of ELOC were also found with the absence of their fathers in early childhood, presence of older siblings, and with being born and brought up in the same area as they resided in <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>surveyed.</b> Protective influences in <b>the</b> <b>surveyed</b> women included positive rating of their mother’s care, having a relatively educated mother, attending boarding school, their own age (the older they were, the less likely were they to have an external orientation), having a mentally ill parent, a sibling hospitalized or a relative die. Conclusions: There are two conclusions: (i) that not all stressful events {{contribute to the development of}} ELOC and it would be essential for models of antecedents of ELOC to take note of this complexity, and (ii) there are consistent (albeit unexpected) findings that highlight associations with cigarette smoke exposure of the woman from fetal life through to when starting to smoke regularly herself in mid-childhood.
