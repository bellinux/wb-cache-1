Two days later the United States Senate confirmed the nomination and Deady received his commission to the court that had been created once Oregon became the 33rd state on February 14, 1859. Deady held the first session of the court on September 12, 1859, in Salem, but had the court relocated to Portland {{by the start of}} the September session of 1860. Deady then moved to Portland where he helped to found the Multnomah County Library. He would serve as president of that organization for a number of years. In Portland, he wrote the <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>incorporation</b> for the city, which became the standard in the state for other cities. At first Portland did not have a courthouse for Deady to use, so he rented two rooms from Benjamin Stark on what is now Water Street until a federal courthouse was built beginning in 1869. That courthouse was first named the United States Building, and is now named the Pioneer Courthouse, with Deady moving into the building when it was finished in 1875.|$|E

It is intuitively plausible that they do not, for they appear to be only luckily true. I argue, however, that, despite its intuitive plausibility, this view is mistaken: once we adopt an adequate (modal) conception of epistemic luck and an adequate (adaptive) general approach to memory, it becomes clear that memory beliefs resulting from the <b>incorporation</b> <b>of</b> accurate testimonial information are not in general luckily true.

In their early discussions, Wilder and the board decided that the museum’s {{programs}} and permanent collection should reflect many aspects of American culture, both historic and contemporary. This decision paved the way for an expansion of the permanent collection that first focused on acquiring American art from the nineteenth-century and, later, the twentieth. Under Wilder’s guidance, the museum collected heavily in the areas of nineteenth-century American art and photography. Wilder also established an academic publishing presence and built a record of organizing groundbreaking exhibitions. The museum published Paper Talk: The Illustrated Letters of Charles M. Russell in 1962, the first of many books on the art of the American West to originate from the Amon Carter. In 1966, Wilder reintroduced the paintings of Georgia O’Keeffe (1887–1986) to the nation by organizing a ninety-five piece retrospective of her work.|$|E

We argue that such three-tiered structure stands for the preconditions of any Charter. Lastly, we set up the Charter as a compact of regulatory and discretionary governance, comprised not only by the <b>articles</b> and certificate <b>of</b> <b>incorporation,</b> but also internal bylaws of the organization, the Statute of Governance, the Code of Good Practices, and provisions for upgrading, overhauling, and even changing the architecture of governance in its entirety...|$|R
