5|$|Aaron Ward and Sterett, {{independently}} {{searching for}} targets, both sighted Yūdachi, who appeared {{unaware of the}} approach of the two U.S. destroyers. Both U.S.ships hit Yūdachi simultaneously with gunfire and torpedoes, heavily damaging the destroyer and forcing her crew to abandon ship. The ship did not sink right away, however. Continuing on her way, Sterett was suddenly ambushed by Teruzuki, heavily damaged, and forced to withdraw from the battle <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east. Aaron Ward wound up in a one-on-one duel with Kirishima, which the destroyer lost with heavy damage. She also tried to retire from the battle <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east but soon stopped dead in the water because the engines were damaged.|$|E
5|$|In 1812 the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway opened, also a horse-operated plateway, {{constructed}} to carry coal from the Kilmarnock <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> harbour at Troon, for onward conveyance by coastal shipping; {{it was the}} first railway in Scotland to have an authorising Act of Parliament.|$|E

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Bosnian War, Jajce was inhabited by people from all ethnic groups, and was situated at a junction between areas of Serb majority <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, Bosnian Muslim majority <b>areas</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south-east and Croatian majority <b>areas</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south-west.|$|R
50|$|In Pittsburgh, total {{snowfall}} accumulations {{varied between}} 6 to 12 in. Overall, <b>areas</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{southwest of the}} city received lesser accumulations while mountainous <b>areas</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east received substantially higher accumulations. The storm created major traffic-related issues on the city's major transportation arteries, including Interstates 79, 279, and 376.|$|R

5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} is {{the least}} symmetric curve of constant width according to two different measures of central asymmetry, the Kovner–Besicovitch measure (ratio of <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> largest centrally symmetric shape enclosed by the curve) and the Estermann measure (ratio of <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> smallest centrally symmetric shape enclosing the curve). For the Reuleaux triangle, the two centrally symmetric shapes that determine the measures of asymmetry are both hexagonal, although the inner one has curved sides. The Reuleaux triangle has diameters that split its area more unevenly than any other curve of constant width. That is, the maximum ratio of areas {{on either side of}} a diameter, another measure of asymmetry, is bigger for the Reuleaux triangle than for other curves of constant width.|$|E
5|$|The <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of {{the city}} drops away rapidly and lacks {{extensive}} settlement remains, perhaps due to periodic flooding by the Mopan and Salsipuedes rivers discouraging the occupation of the eastern zone.|$|E

5|$|A {{section of}} rubble wall about 15m (50ft) long and 4m (13ft) high remains, {{incorporated}} into an outbuilding of the adjacent farm on its north side. The ruins and the later farmhouse are jointly grade II listed and the castle remains are {{designated as a}} scheduled monument. The <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south of the wall has been excavated to reveal the ashlar bases of two polygonal towers. The site is {{on the east side}} of Castle Street in a private garden to which there is no public access.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>areas</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of McPhillips Street are {{considered}} the Old North End, and were developed in the late 19th century and early 20th century, while <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west were generally developed in the 1940s and later. The area is primarily residential, though there is some light industrial development in Inkster Industrial Park and adjacent to Oak Point Highway and Brookside Boulevard.|$|R
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{national}} forests and wildlife preserves—including the Klamath National Forest, Six Rivers National Forest, Klamath National Wildlife Refuges Complex, and Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge—are {{located in the}} Klamath River watershed. The Klamath National Forest is located in Siskiyou County with a small portion in Oregon, and Six Rivers National Forest {{is located in the}} southern Klamath watershed, mostly in the Trinity River watershed. The latter two are located in the Upper Klamath Lake-Lower Klamath Lake area. Lava Beds National Monument, which contains a large array of lava tubes and formations, is also in the Lower Klamath Lake <b>area,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south of the remnants of the lake.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture {{dominates the}} {{northern}} shore, where many plots of land are still {{owned by the}} descendants of early settlers. The largely abandoned historical communities of Rosita and West Portland are also located in this <b>area.</b> <b>To</b> <b>the</b> west, the Odem Bay extension is formed, and is fed by Rincon Bayou and a large complex of marsh formed by the Nueces River delta.

50|$|Like all of Eastern Washington, the Teanaway Valley sits in {{the rain}} shadow of the Cascade Mountains.

5|$|An old style mercury {{barometer}} {{consists of a}} vertical glass tube about 1cm in diameter partially filled with mercury, and with a vacuum (called Torricelli's vacuum) in the unfilled volume (see diagram to the right). Notice that the mercury level {{at the center of}} the tube is higher than at the edges, making the upper surface of the mercury dome-shaped. The center of mass of the entire column of mercury would be slightly lower if the top surface of the mercury were flat over the entire cross-section of the tube. But the dome-shaped top gives slightly less surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> entire mass of mercury. Again the two effects combine to minimize the total potential energy. Such a surface shape is known as a convex meniscus.|$|E
5|$|As the Racer {{endured the}} gale, another vessel to her north, HMSRingdove, felt the storm {{around the same}} time. Both ships {{recorded}} easterly winds for several days as they traversed the Yucatán Channel, indicating that the storm center remained to their south. The hurricane crossed the northern Yucatán Peninsula and moved west-northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico, nearing {{the mouth of the}} Rio Grande by early on October3. The storm is estimated to have peaked as the equivalence of a Category4 or stronger on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson scale. As the hurricane approached a strong high pressure <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, it slowed drastically and recurved sharply to the northeast while its center was just off southern Texas.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war, a discontinuous front line ran through southern Finland from west to east, dividing the country into White Finland and Red Finland. The Red Guards controlled the <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south, including nearly all the major towns and industrial centres, and the largest estates and farms with high numbers of crofters and tenant farmers. The White Army controlled the <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, which was predominantly agrarian with small or medium-sized farms and tenant farmers, and where crofters were few, or held a better social position than in the south. Enclaves of the opposing forces existed {{on both sides of the}} front line: within the White area lay the industrial towns of Varkaus, Kuopio, Oulu, Raahe, Kemi and Tornio; within the Red area lay Porvoo, Kirkkonummi and Uusikaupunki. The elimination of these strongholds was a priority for both armies in February 1918.|$|E
