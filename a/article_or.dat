5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether {{the story of the}} Tree That Owns Itself began with the Weekly Banner <b>article,</b> <b>or</b> if it had been an element of local {{folklore}} prior to that time. The article's author writes that, in 1890, there were few people still living who knew the story.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} of Proto-Central-Semitic shows {{significant changes}} compared with Proto-Semitic, especially in its verbs, and {{is much like}} in Classical Arabic. Nouns in the singular were usually declined in three cases: /-u/ (nominative), /-a/ (accusative) or /-i/ (genitive). In some circumstances (but never in the construct state), nouns also took a final nasal after the case ending: nunation (final /-n/) occurred in some languages, mimation (final /-m/) in others. The original meaning of this marker is uncertain. In Classical Arabic, final /-n/ on nouns indicates indefiniteness and disappears when the noun is preceded by a definite <b>article</b> <b>or</b> otherwise becomes definite in meaning. In other languages, final /-n/ may be present whenever a noun {{is not in the}} construct state. Old Canaanite had mimation, of uncertain meaning, in an occurrence of the word urušalemim (Jerusalem) as given in an Egyptian transcription.|$|E

25|$|The {{difference}} between Martí and other modernist initiators such as Manuel Gutiérrez Nájera, Julian del Casal, and José Asunción Silva (and {{the similarity between}} him and Manuel González Prada) lies in the profound and transcendent value that he gave to literature, converting prose into an <b>article</b> <b>or</b> {{the work of a}} journalist. This hard work was important in giving literature authentic and independent value and distancing it from mere formal amusement. Manuel Gutiérez Nájera, Rubén Darío, Miguel de Unamuno and José Enrique Rodó saved the Martinian articles, which will have an endless value in the writings of the American continent.|$|E
25|$|Having a paper (<b>article</b> <b>or</b> letter) {{published}} in Nature or any Nature publication such as Nature chemistry or Nature chemical biology is very prestigious, and the papers are often highly cited, {{which can lead}} to promotions, grant funding, and attention from the mainstream media. Because of these positive feedback effects, competition among scientists to publish in high-level journals like Nature and its closest competitor, Science, can be very fierce. Natures impact factor, a measure of how many citations a journal generates in other works, was 38.138 in 2015 (as measured by Thomson ISI), among the highest of any science journal.|$|E
25|$|Any {{change or}} edit that manipulates content {{in a way}} that purposefully compromises the {{integrity}} of Wikipedia is considered vandalism. The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor. Vandalism can also include advertising and other types of spam. Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information to an article, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an <b>article,</b> <b>or</b> use images disruptively.|$|E

25|$|In {{the domain}} of letters he {{remained}} until his death a veritable pontiff, and an <b>article</b> <b>or</b> book of his was an event celebrated {{from one end of}} Portugal to the other. The nation continued to look up to him for intellecual leadership, but, in his later years, lacking hope himself, he could not stimulate others or use to advantage the powers conferred upon him. In politics he remained a constitutional Liberal of the old type, and, for him, the people were the middle classes in opposition to the lower, which he saw to have been the supporters of tyranny in all ages, while he considered radicalism to mean a return via anarchy to absolutism. However, though he conducted political propaganda campaigns in the press in his early days, Herculano never exercised much influence in politics.|$|E
25|$|Authorship is {{a primary}} basis that {{employers}} use to evaluate academic personnel for employment, promotion, and tenure. In academic publishing, authorship of a work is claimed by those making intellectual contributions to {{the completion of the}} research described in the work. In simple cases, a solitary scholar carries out a research project and writes the subsequent <b>article</b> <b>or</b> book. In many disciplines, however, collaboration is the norm and issues of authorship can be controversial. In these contexts, authorship can encompass activities other than writing the article; a researcher who comes up with an experimental design and analyzes the data may be considered an author, even if she or he had little role in composing the text describing the results. According to some standards, even writing the entire article would not constitute authorship unless the writer was also involved in at least one other phase of the project.|$|E
25|$|A very {{favorite}} {{style of}} chip pattern is that formed by small triangles and squares entirely covering a {{surface in the}} Cook Islands, the monotony being sometimes varied by a band of different arrangement {{in the middle of}} the <b>article</b> <b>or</b> at the top or bottom. So far as the cultivation of patience and accuracy is concerned, has no equal. The Fiji Islanders, employ chip designs rivaling those of Europe in variety. Upon occasion the aboriginal Marquesas carver appreciates the way in which plain surfaces contrast and emphasize decorated parts, and judiciously restricts his skill to bands of decoration or to special points. The Ijos of the lower Niger design their paddles in a masterly way, and show a fine sense of proportion between the plain and the decorated surface. Their designs, though slightly in relief, are of the chip nature. The method of decorating a subject with groups of incised lines, straight or curved, though often very effective and in every way suitable, is not a very advanced form of art and has decided limits. The natives of the Congo, now two nations, covered by the landmass of the Republic of the Congo and Democratic Republic of the Congo does good work of this kind.|$|E
