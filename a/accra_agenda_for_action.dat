50|$|The <b>Accra</b> <b>Agenda</b> <b>for</b> <b>Action</b> {{sets out}} {{a list of}} {{commitments}} for its signatories, building on those already agreed in the Paris Declaration. It asks the OECD’s Working Party on Aid Effectiveness to continue monitoring progress on implementing the Paris Declaration and the <b>Accra</b> <b>Agenda</b> <b>for</b> <b>Action</b> and to report back to the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in December 2011. Many donor and recipient governments {{will have to make}} serious changes if the AAA’s aims are to be fulfilled. The fact that ministers have signed up to these changes in Accra makes the AAA a political document—rather than a technocratic prescription—to move from business as usual to a new way of working together.|$|E

The <b>Accra</b> <b>Agenda</b> <b>for</b> <b>Action</b> aims to incorporate the contributions of all development players—middle-income countries, global funds, the private sector, civil society organisations—into more inclusive partnerships. The aim is for all the providers of aid {{to use the same}} principles and procedures, so that all their efforts are coherent and have greater impact on reducing poverty.|$|E
5000|$|Country ownership. The <b>Accra</b> <b>Agenda</b> <b>for</b> <b>Action</b> says developing-country governments {{still need}} to take {{stronger}} leadership of their own development policies and engage further with their parliaments and citizens in shaping them. Donors must commit to supporting them by respecting countries’ priorities, investing in their human resources and institutions, making greater use of their systems to deliver aid, and further increasing the predictability of aid flows.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Accra</b> <b>Agenda</b> <b>for</b> <b>Action</b> {{states that}} {{transparency}} and accountability are essential elements for development results, as well as drivers of progress.

5000|$|Achieving {{development}} results—and openly {{accounting for}} them. The <b>Accra</b> <b>Agenda</b> <b>for</b> <b>Action</b> says {{the demonstration of}} impact must be placed more squarely {{at the heart of}} efforts to make aid more effective. There is a strong focus on helping developing countries to produce stronger national statistical and information systems to help them better monitor and evaluate impact. More than ever, citizens and taxpayers of all countries expect to see the tangible results of development efforts. In the AAA, developing countries commit to making their revenues, expenditures, budgets, procurements and audits public. Donors commit to disclosing regular and timely information on their aid flows.|$|E
50|$|There {{is broad}} {{acknowledgement}} that new global challenges, such as rising food and fuel prices and climate change, bring added urgency to {{efforts to make}} aid as effective as possible. On {{the first two days}} of the HLF-3, there was a series of nine Roundtables covering the key issues in aid effectiveness, from country ownership to managing aid in situations of conflict and fragility. On the third day of the Forum, ministers endorsed the <b>Accra</b> <b>Agenda</b> <b>for</b> <b>Action</b> (AAA). This ministerial statement has been developed with support from a multi-national consensus group working {{under the auspices of the}} OECD’s Working Party on Aid Effectiveness.|$|E
5000|$|The {{initiative}} was launched on September 4, 2008, at the Third High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness held in Accra, Ghana. The {{goal of the}} forum was to refocus attention worldwide on the steps needed to reach the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals. It was presented by the United Kingdom's Secretary of International Development Douglas Alexander; along with Kemal Derviş, Head of the United Nations Development Programme; James Musconi, the Rwandan finance minister; and Kumi Naidoo, then president of CIVICUS. Mr. Alexander recommended creating {{a common set of}} openness standards by which donors can be judged. 14 international donors pledged to expand transparency as a result, and an agreement was reached to develop a common format for the release of aid information by 2010. A statement was issued by the signatories, which formally accepted the policies set forth in the <b>Accra</b> <b>Agenda</b> <b>for</b> <b>Action</b> and agreed to form the IATI. The text of the statement suggests that aid donors should: ...|$|E

40|$|Background: This study {{examines}} {{the potential of}} aid effectiveness to positively influence human resources for health in developing countries, based on research {{carried out in the}} Lao People 2 ̆ 7 s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). Efforts to make aid more effective-as articulated in the 2005 Paris Declaration and recently reiterated in the 2008 <b>Accra</b> <b>Agenda</b> <b>for</b> Action-are becoming an increasingly prominent part of the development agenda. A common criticism, though, is that these discussions have limited impact at sector level. Human resources for health are characterized by a rich and complex network of interactions and influences-both across government and the donor community. This complexity provides a good prism through which to assess the potential of the aid effectiveness agenda to support health development and, conversely, possibilities to extend the impact of aid-effectiveness approaches to sector level...|$|R

5000|$|Research by the Overseas Development Institute {{based on}} {{in-person}} interviews with senior politicians {{and government officials}} in Ethiopia, Sierra Leone and Zambia suggests that the <b>Accra</b> <b>Agenda</b> <b>for</b> <b>Action</b> (AAA) and Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness's indicators are too narrowly defined and lack depth. The principles of [...] "predictability" [...] and [...] "transparency" [...] are highlighted as lacking depth and important sub-dimensions not given enough emphasis, for instance on adaptation to local contexts. The interviews revealed recipient governments felt [...] "predictability" [...] meant donors should provide funding within the quarters scheduled, the Paris Declaration work {{on an annual basis}} and makes no distinction between the first and fourth quarter. Also mentioned, were the differences between pledges and actual commitments, the need to speed up the approval process and the need to make explicit and achievable conditions on the aid, to prevent withholding of funds when minor conditions are not fully achieved. Transparency in the reasons for donors' decisions was also seen as very important, the need to be 'frank' about why less funding was disbursed than committed, why feedback from the recipient government was not taken on board, and why a given percentage of funds was earmarked for certain activities such as technical assistance (TA). The resulting conclusion from these interviews and other studies is that repeatedly, the three most important issues for donor recipients are: ...|$|E

Recent developments in the overseas development assistance landscape have important implications for how donors approach civil society policy and practice.

All CD processes supported by the EC are to be designed, managed and monitored with local partners in the lead to ensure that they are demand-driven and contextually appropriate...|$|E

Uganda is an interesting case for assessing progress on Paris Principles and seeing the New Aid Architecture in practice. This article provides a historical overview of the implementation of 'Paris' in Uganda from the late 1990 s up to 2010, showing that implementation is laggardly and, in more recent years, that earlier progress has been reversed. This is due to donors' perceptions of Uganda's political structure, and particularly its rampant corruption, and also to different views among donors and their internal adaptability in terms of truly measuring up to the Paris Principles...|$|E
40|$|The paper mainly {{contributes}} {{to the problem of}} measurement of aid fragmentation, prioritised by the <b>Accra</b> <b>Agenda</b> <b>for</b> <b>Action</b> in 2008. Here, a new index is proposed by considering the significance of donor-partner country aid relations in financial terms as well as multiple aspects of this phenomenon relating to coordination among donors, the commitment between donors and recipients, and the resilience of the recipient countries. As measurability renders countries accountable, and as a good system of accountability can change behaviour in the development community, this analysis and maintaining it over time can have a crucial role towards orienting further donor efforts in development aid and towards guiding their budget allocation.
