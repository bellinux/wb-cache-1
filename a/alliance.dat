5000|$|Adding to the {{variability}} of male <b>alliances,</b> some species such as bottlenose dolphins form at least two levels of male <b>alliances.</b> The first level of <b>alliances,</b> termed first order <b>alliances,</b> to guard access to females and closely resemble the <b>alliances</b> previously discussed in primate species. Second order <b>alliances</b> form between two first order <b>alliances.</b> The resulting “super alliance” works to herd females and defend them, preventing outside males from gaining access to females.

40|$|This {{formation}} of new business arrangements, {{in the form}} of strategic <b>alliances,</b> is the topic upon which this thesis is focused. Two new types of business agreements, which have been observed, are strategic contract-based <b>alliances</b> and strategic fuzzy <b>alliances.</b> While, contract-based <b>alliances</b> are new, in that firms are choosing non-traditional partners, strategic fuzzy <b>alliances</b> are quite unique as they involve trust. The aim of this thesis is to analyse these <b>alliances</b> and the role of trust in business-to-business relationships. This will be accomplished in two ways. First, using Shapiro et al. 's (1992) taxonomy of trust and a neo-classical framework, a theoretical model of governance choice involving strategic <b>alliances</b> is developed. Based on transaction theory, this model is then used to generate necessary and sufficient conditions for trust-based agreements and supports an empirical model. The second component of this paper is an empirical model testing the above theory. Using a survey of horticultural and pork processing firms, a multinomial logit model that explains governance choice is developed. Results indicate that: (1) strategic fuzzy <b>alliances</b> are less common than previously thought; (2) asset and contract-based <b>alliances</b> continue to be the <b>alliances</b> of choice; (3) firm behaviour, vis-a-vis strategic <b>alliances</b> is consistent with neo-classical notions of the firm; and (4) risk is a major determinant of governance choice.
