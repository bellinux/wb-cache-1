40|$|A {{discussion}} is presented {{of the question}} of establishing a boundary between <b>air</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> outer <b>space.</b> Four theories <b>and</b> approaches for establishing a delimitation between <b>air</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> outer <b>space</b> are examined. Spatial approaches include demarcation based on the division of the atmosphere into layers, demarcation based on aerodynamic characteristics of flight instrumentalities (von Karman Line), demarcation according to the lowest perigee of an orbiting satellite, and demarcation based upon the earth's gravitational effects. The functionalist approach is based on the delimitation or definition of the air space/outer space regime by the purpose and activities for which an object is designed in air space or outer space. The arbitrarist approach is supported by those who wish to draw an arbitrary line between <b>air</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> outer <b>space.</b> It is proposed that a pragmatist approach will be more useful than the other three approaches. The pragmatist approach advocates not establishing a boundary between <b>air</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> outer <b>space</b> at the present time or in the immediate future. It is argued that there are at present no serious problems that can be resolved by the definition/delimitation of <b>air</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> outer <b>space...</b>|$|R

5|$|Enola Gay {{became the}} center of a {{controversy}} at the Smithsonian Institution when the museum planned to put its fuselage on public display in 1995 as part of an exhibit commemorating the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.

5|$|The Akutan Zero was {{destroyed}} during a training accident in February 1945. While the Zero was taxiing for a take-off, a Curtiss SB2C Helldiver lost control and rammed into it. The Helldiver's propeller sliced the Zero into pieces. From the wreckage, William N. Leonard salvaged several gauges, which he {{donated to the}} National Museum of the United States Navy. The Alaska Heritage Museum and the Smithsonian National <b>Air</b> <b>and</b> <b>Space</b> Museum also have small pieces of the Zero.|$|E
5|$|The Dayton region {{gave birth}} to {{aviation}} and {{is known for its}} high concentration of aerospace and aviation technology. In 2009, Governor Ted Strickland designated Dayton as Ohio's aerospace innovation hub, the state's first such technology hub. Two major United States research and development organizations have leveraged Dayton's historical leadership in aviation and maintain their headquarters in the area: The National <b>Air</b> <b>and</b> <b>Space</b> Intelligence Center (NASIC) and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). NASIC is the U.S. military's primary producer of intelligence on foreign <b>air</b> <b>and</b> <b>space</b> forces, weapons, and systems, while the AFRL provides leading-edge warfighting capabilities. Both have their headquarters at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is one of the Air Force's largest air base wings. The installation generated a total economic impact in the Dayton area of $4.67billion in fiscal year 2011, a decline from $5.1billion in fiscal year 2009. In addition, state officials are working to make the Dayton region a hub and a leader for UAV research and manufacturing.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, Air France {{signed a}} letter of {{agreement}} to donate a Concorde to the National <b>Air</b> <b>and</b> <b>Space</b> Museum in Washington D.C. upon the aircraft's retirement. On 12 June 2003, Air France honoured that agreement, donating Concorde F-BVFA (serial 205) to the Museum upon the completion of its last flight. This aircraft was the first Air France Concorde to open service to Rio de Janeiro, Washington, D.C., and New York and had flown 17,824 hours. It is {{on display at the}} Smithsonian's Steven F.

5|$|In the 1980s, {{veterans}} groups {{engaged in}} a call for the Smithsonian to put the aircraft on display, leading to an acrimonious debate about exhibiting the aircraft without a proper historical context. The cockpit and nose section of the aircraft were exhibited at the National <b>Air</b> <b>and</b> <b>Space</b> Museum (NASM) in downtown Washington, D.C., for the bombing's 50th anniversary in 1995, amid controversy. Since 2003, the entire restored B-29 has been on display at NASM's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. The last survivor of its crew, Theodore Van Kirk, died on July 28, 2014, {{at the age of}} 93.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of his forty-seven years in {{designing}} and building planes, Verville contributed to the design and development of nearly twenty different aircraft. A plane he designed, the Verville-Sperry M-1 Messenger is on permanent exhibition at the National <b>Air</b> <b>and</b> <b>Space</b> Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. Another plane he designed, the Verville-Sperry R-3 Racer won first place at the 1924 Pulitzer Trophy Races. In June 1961, it was honored as one of the twelve most significant aircraft of all time by Popular Mechanics and it was featured on a USPS airmail stamp issued in 1985.|$|E
