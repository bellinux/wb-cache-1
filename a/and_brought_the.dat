5|$|After a 40-day delay {{caused by}} faulty {{computer}} chips, Kvant-2 was launched on 26 November 1989. After problems deploying the craft's solar array {{and with the}} automated docking systems on both Kvant-2 and Mir, the new module was docked manually on 6 December. Kvant-2 added {{a second set of}} gyrodines to Mir, <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> new life support systems for recycling water and generating oxygen, reducing dependence on ground resupply. The module featured a large airlock with a one-metre hatch. A special backpack unit (known as Ikar), an equivalent of the US Manned Maneuvering Unit, was located inside Kvant-2's airlock.|$|E

Immediately, Mike England made a substitution, withdrawing midfielder Robbie James and bringing on forward Steve Lovell {{in an effort to}} regain the advantage. Two minutes later he made his second and final substitution, bringing off Mickey Thomas for Clayton Blackmore.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{military}} and political weakness, during his rule Bulgaria remained a major cultural center and the ideas of Hesychasm dominated the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. Patriarch Evtimiy of Tarnovo became the most prominent cultural figure of the country. A number of texts were written or translated and an orthographic reform of the Bulgarian language was issued with synchronised rules. After the fall of Bulgaria, a number of scholars found refuge in the other Orthodox countries <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> achievements of the Bulgarian culture to them.|$|E
5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, the Caribbean Sea was {{initially}} an important theatre of naval conflict, as ships operating {{from the various}} French, British, Spanish and Dutch colonies preyed on enemy trade. During 1809 and 1810 however, the Royal Navy launched a series of co-ordinated amphibious operations that eliminated the French and Dutch colonies <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> conflict in the Caribbean to an end. With the threat of attacks on British trade in the region significantly reduced, the Royal Navy correspondingly reduced {{their presence in the}} Caribbean and the remaining British ships were distributed to observe trouble spots in the region, which in 1812 included the independent nation of Haiti.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Butterfield, on vocals and harmoica, and Bishop, {{accompanying}} him on guitar, {{were offered}} a regular gig at Big John's, a folk {{club in the}} Old Town district on Chicago's North Side. With this booking, they persuaded bassist Jerome Arnold and drummer Sam Lay (both from Howlin' Wolf's touring band) to form a group with them in 1963.

5|$|Florida State's offense {{returned}} to the field with 4:35 remaining and needing to score rapidly {{in order to make}} up the 18-point deficit, the game's largest. The Seminoles began their drive with their passing offense, trying three passes in four plays. Quarterback Manuel completed two of those three pass attempts, gaining 37 yards and advancing deep into Virginia Tech territory. A pass interference penalty against Virginia Tech advanced the Seminoles to the Tech 11-yard line, and three rushing plays later, running back Ty Jones crossed the goal line for a touchdown. The score came with 1:40 remaining in the quarter <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> score to 35–24.|$|E
5|$|Florida State's victory {{earned it}} the 1999 BCS {{national}} championship <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> Seminoles' season {{to an end}} with an undefeated 120 record. By beginning the season at No.1 and ending {{it in the same}} position, Florida State became the first college football team to stay ranked No.1 for every week of the season after being ranked No. 1 in the preseason poll. Virginia Tech's loss brought it to a final record of 111, but the Hokies still completed their first 11-win season in school history. The 75total points scored in the 2000 Sugar Bowl were a Sugar Bowl record at that point in the game's history.|$|E
5|$|From 1969 to 1975, Baxter was {{part-time}} and unpaid {{chairman of}} the Sydney Opera House Trust. He had recently retired from the UNSW, but the job was no sinecure. The architect, Jørn Utzon, had left, construction was behind schedule and over budget, and specialist staff needed to be recruited. Baxter put the project under his unpopular but decisive grip, <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> Sydney Opera House to completion and opening on 20 October 1973.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's victory {{gave the}} team its sixth {{consecutive}} 10-win season <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> Hokies {{to a final}} 2009 record of 10-3. It {{was the first time}} in school history that Tech won bowl games in consecutive years. Tennessee's loss dropped it to 7-6, and the Volunteers remained unranked in the final college football polls of the year. Virginia Tech was credited for its bowl-game win and rose to 10th in both the Associated Press and coaches' polls. Visiting fans generated an estimated $31.2 million in business for the Atlanta area.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{victory was}} just its second bowl win {{in school history}} <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> Hokies to a final 1993 record of 93.

Despite those accolades, the victory failed to move the Hokies up in the AP poll, which kept Tech at No. 22 in the final ranking of the season.|$|E
5|$|Arkansas was {{anchored}} in Casco Bay, Maine, on 7 December 1941, when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> United States into the war. A week later, she steamed to Hvalfjordur, Iceland, {{and returned to}} Boston on 24 January 1942. She conducted training maneuvers in Casco Bay, to prepare her crew for convoy escort duties. On 6 March, she arrived at Norfolk, to begin overhaul. The secondary battery was reduced to six 5-inch/51 cal guns. Also, 36 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft (AA) guns (in quadruple mounts) and 26 20 mm Oerlikon AA guns were added, the experience at Pearl Harbor having made the US Navy {{aware of the need}} for increased light AA armament. The 3-inch/50 caliber gun armament was also increased from 8 guns to 10. Work lasted until 2 July, after which time Arkansas conducted a shakedown cruise in Chesapeake Bay; she then proceeded to New York, arriving on 27 July. There, she became the flagship of Task Force 38 (TF 38), the escort for a convoy of twelve transports bound for Scotland. The convoy arrived in Greenock, on 17 August, and Arkansas returned to New York on 4 September.|$|E
