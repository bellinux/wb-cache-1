5|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>husbandry</b> has a {{significant}} impact on the world environment. It is responsible for somewhere between 20 and 33% of the fresh water usage in the world, and livestock, and the production of feed for them, occupy about a third of the earth's ice-free land. Livestock production is a contributing factor in species extinction, desertification, and habitat destruction. Animal agriculture contributes to species extinction in various ways. Habitat is destroyed by clearing forests and converting land to grow feed crops and for animal grazing, while predators and herbivores are frequently targeted and hunted because of a perceived threat to livestock profits; for example, <b>animal</b> <b>husbandry</b> is responsible for up to 91% of the deforestation in the Amazon region. In addition, livestock produce greenhouse gases. Cows produce some 570 million cubic metres of methane per day. Livestock is responsible for 65% of all human-related emissions of the powerful and long-lived greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. As a result, ways of mitigating animal husbandry's environmental impact are being studied. Strategies include using biogas from manure.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: Due to {{the high}} {{nutritional}} value of milk, it has {{an important role in}} human nutrition, and on the other hand, it is a suitable medium for the growth of bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is an opportunistic pathogen highly resistant to antibiotics and can cause disease in immunodeficient patients. The {{purpose of this study was}} isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from raw milk, detection of tox A gene by PCR, and determining antibiotic resistance, multiple resistance of the isolates, and Identification of ESBL isolates.   Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 360 samples (300 samples of raw milk, 30 samples pasteurized milk, and 30 samples of cream), were collected from <b>animal</b> <b>husbandries</b> and stores in Qom city. Initially, the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were confirmed by standard microbiological methods, and then the existence of exotoxin A gene in all isolates was detected by PCR method and the antibiotic resistance of the isolates against 10 antibiotics selected from different antibiotic categories, was investigated according to the CLSI standard. The data were analyzed using t-test.   Results: Out of 360 studied samples, 117 Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated, among which 101 strains (86. 30 %) had tox A gene. In antibiotic resistance testing, the highest resistance was seen against ceftazidime, and it was revealed that there is a significant relationship between the presence of tox A gene and antibiotic resistance in the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.   Conclusion: Due to high presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in raw milk and existence of antibiotic resistance genes in this bacterium, applying appropriate strategies for hygiene control in <b>animal</b> <b>husbandries,</b> is necessary to prevent the spread of bacteria...|$|R

40|$|Background: African animal {{trypanosomosis}} (AAT), or nagana, {{is widespread}} within the tsetse-infested belt of sub-Saharan Africa. Although {{a wealth of}} information on its occurrence and prevalence is available in the literature, synthesized and harmonized data at the regional and continental scales are lacking. To fill this gap the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) launched the Atlas of tsetse and AAT, jointly implemented with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in the framework of the Programme Against African Trypanosomosis (PAAT). Methods: The Atlas aims to build and regularly update a geospatial database of tsetse species occurrence and AAT at the continental level. The present paper focuses on the methodology to assemble a dynamic database of AAT, which hinges on herd-level prevalence data as estimated using various diagnostic techniques. A range of ancillary information items is also included (e. g. trypanosome species, survey period, species and breed of <b>animals,</b> <b>husbandry</b> system, etc.).

5|$|Darwin's speculations on {{the origin}} of species {{convinced}} him that cross-fertilisation {{played an important role in}} keeping specific forms consistent. He rejected the doctrine that the characteristics of a species were static, and was aware from <b>animal</b> <b>husbandry</b> that inbreeding could lead to changes, often deleterious. He thought that natural outbreeding through cross-fertilisation would keep wild species homogenous yet vigorous. Cross-fertilisation would confer an evolutionary advantage by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community. His ideas were contrary to the common supposition that plants were usually self-fertilising, and so every summer Darwin investigated the contribution of insect pollination to the cross-pollination of flowers.|$|E
5|$|Game hunting was a {{familiar}} beneficial skill to the colonists when they immigrated to the New World. Most northern colonists depended upon hunting, whether they hunted themselves or purchased game from others. As a method of obtaining protein for consumption, hunting was preferred over <b>animal</b> <b>husbandry</b> as domestic animals were expensive and more work was required to defend domestic animals against natural predators, Native Americans, or the French. Commonly hunted game included deer, bear, buffalo, and turkey. The larger parts of the animals were roasted and served with currant and other sauces, while smaller portions went into soups, stews, sausages, pies, and pasties.|$|E
5|$|Husbandry, {{especially}} if it is intensive, has a substantial environmental impact, occupying {{about a third of}} the earth's ice-free land, causing loss of habitat and emitting about half of all greenhouse gas worldwide.
