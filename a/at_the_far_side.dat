5|$|The islet in {{the left}} foreground, today known as Riddarholmen ("Knights' Islet"), was during the medieval era known as Gråmunkeholmen ("Greyfriars Islet") after the Franciscan monastery located there and in the {{painting}} represented as a building with stepped gables and a tall turret <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of the islet. Together with other similar institutions, the monastery was closed by the king following the Reformation although the building {{was used as a}} hospital until the mid 16th century. The turret of the monastery was replaced by the cast iron spire of Riddarholm Church in the 19th century, but the remains of the monastery still exist inside the church and under the surrounding buildings.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Midland Mainline, as {{the main}} TOC of the station, instigated a major {{regeneration}} of Sheffield station. Prior to this, a taxi rank was located inside {{what is now the}} main concourse and the new entrance hall. The stone façade of the station was sandblasted and its archways filled with unobstructed windows to improve views both from inside and out. Other changes included the improvement of platform surfaces and the addition of a pedestrian bridge connecting the station concourse with the Sheffield Supertram stop <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of the station.|$|E
25|$|The {{main station}} entrance, facing Sheaf Square, is the {{location}} of the main concourse and most of the station's facilities. The ticket office, ticket machines, information desk and a number of retail units are located there, and public toilets and facilities such as cash machines and a left luggage facility. There are further shops and facilities on the island platforms and in the Supertram entrance hall <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of the station. There are waiting rooms on the island platforms and the East Midlands Trains first class lounge is within the station buildings, by platform 5.|$|E

25|$|By 2005, Strood {{was served}} by two supermarkets, Tesco {{acquiring}} and demolishing Temple Street {{and bought the}} freehold {{of all the other}} plots on the block for future expansion, and Safeway in the High Street, built on the site of small firms and the Budden and Biggs Brewery. Following the takeover by Morrisons, the store was closed with a new, larger site built <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of Jane's Creek – the town centre store lay empty until autumn 2008, when it was redeveloped by the marginal supermarket retailer Netto and discount chain Wilko (the Netto store has since been remodelled as an Asda following a buyout).|$|E
25|$|Longstreet {{gave the}} order to move at 11:10a.m. and Johnson's {{division}} proceeded across the Brotherton field, by coincidence to precisely the point where Wood's Union division was {{pulling out of the}} line. Johnson's brigade on the left, commanded by Col. John S. Fulton, drove directly through the gap. The brigade on the right, under Brig. Gen. Evander McNair, encountered opposition from Brannan's division (parts of Col. John M. Connell's brigade), but was also able to push through. The few Union soldiers in that sector ran in panic from the onslaught. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of the Dyer field, several Union batteries of the XXI Corps reserve artillery were set up, but without infantry support. Although the Confederate infantrymen hesitated briefly, Gregg's brigade, commanded by Col. Cyrus Sugg, which flanked the guns on their right, Sheffield's brigade, commanded by Col. William Perry, and the brigade of Brig. Gen. Jerome B. Robertson, captured 15 of the 26 cannons on the ridge.|$|E
25|$|The Tarzan Swing: This was a steel arch {{hanging from}} a -long cable over a spring-fed pool. Patrons waited in long lines {{for the chance to}} hang from it, swing out over the water, then jump off as the beam reached its height. In early years the area patrons jumped off from was not over the water but a {{cushioned}} area. Some people who let go as soon as they started their swing would land on the cushion and then slide/crash into the water. In the mid-1980s the starting position was shifted so that patrons started over the water. Some patrons hung on too long and scraped their toes on the concrete <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side.</b> Others used the ride properly, but were then surprised to find out the water underneath was very cold. It was cold enough, in fact, that the lifeguards sometimes had to rescue people who were so surprised by the sudden chill that they could not swim out of the pool. In 1984, one man died from a heart attack after experiencing the swing.|$|E

A {{dozen or}} so separate work stations can be seen, consisting of a smooth polished surface, with a metallic box resting on top, studded with {{what appear to be}} electrical switches and a gas outlet.

As {{he went to}} the Marsh, in the twilight, he felt that the Angels, with covered faces, were standing back as he went by. The darkness was of their shadows and the covering of their faces. When he went through the Canal bridge, the evening glowed in its last deep colours, the sky was dark blue, the stars glittered from afar, very remote and approaching above the darkening cluster of the farm, above the paths of crystal {{along the edge of the}} heavens.|$|R
500|$|Davis {{described}} Mr. Hooper as [...] "slightly cranky but good-hearted". [...] Gikow called Mr. Hooper [...] "curmudgeonly". [...] Davis {{stated that}} since Mr. Hooper's {{appearance in the}} first episode of Sesame Street, he had become many things to many young children, [...] "...the guy in the apron <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of the generation gap, his half-lens glasses slipping down his nose". [...] Davis also stated that Hooper's Store, which he called [...] "an idealized social institution", {{is an extension of}} Mr. Hooper's personality. [...] Mr. Hooper has a special relationship with the Muppet character Big Bird, who would often come into Hooper's Store for a birdseed milkshake and a chat. A running gag in the show was that Big Bird would often mispronounce Mr. Hooper's name, although most attempts ended in [...] "ooper," [...] such as [...] "Looper" [...] or [...] "Cooper". [...] Mr. Hooper's first name, Harold, was not revealed until the character earned a GED during night school.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his early}} career, Fowler {{had worked with}} steam engines and the logical {{progression}} was to apply this method of power to his drainage plough. This he did in 1852 when he designed a steam engine with a winch mounted {{out in front of}} the smoke box and a rope running from it, round a pulley anchored <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of the field and back to the engine. The engine pulled itself across the field, dragging the mole plough behind it. The design was therefore similar to his first design for the horse-powered plough. The experiment was a failure because the steam engine proved to be too heavy to move easily over soft ground. However, in the same year, on 21 October, Fowler was awarded patent number 480 for [...] "Improvements in Machinery for draining land", believed to be one of the first patents for the use of steam power in agriculture.|$|E
