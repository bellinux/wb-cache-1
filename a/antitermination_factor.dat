40|$|Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA (rRNA) operons contain antitermination motifs {{necessary}} for forming terminator-resistant transcription complexes. In preliminary work, we isolated ‘antiterminating’ transcription complexes and identified four new proteins potentially involved in rRNA transcription antitermination: ribosomal (r-) proteins S 4, L 3, L 4 and L 13. We show here that these r-proteins and Nus factors {{lead to an}} 11 -fold increase in terminator read-through in in vitro transcription reactions. A {{significant portion of the}} effect was a result of r-protein S 4. We show that S 4 acted as a general <b>antitermination</b> <b>factor,</b> with properties very similar to NusA. It retarded termination and increased read-through at Rho-dependent terminators, {{even in the absence of}} the rRNA antiterminator motif. High concentrations of NusG showed reduced antitermination by S 4. Like rrn antitermination, S 4 selectively antiterminated at Rho-dependent terminators. Lastly, S 4 tightly bound RNA polymerase in vivo. Our results suggest that, like NusA, S 4 is a general transcription <b>antitermination</b> <b>factor</b> that associates with RNA polymerase during normal transcription and is also involved in rRNA operon antitermination. A model for key r-proteins playing a regulatory role in rRNA synthesis is presented...|$|E
40|$|International audienceM 2 - 1 is an {{essential}} co-factor of the respiratory syncytial virus, an important respiratory pathogen in infants and calves. It acts as a transcription <b>antitermination</b> <b>factor</b> which enhances the processivity of the polymerase. Within the polymerase complex, M 2 - 1 interacts with a second co-factor, the phosphoprotein P. It has been shown previously that P and RNA bind to M 2 - 1 in a competitive manner in vitro and that these properties are related to a central domain located between residues Glu 59 and Lys 177. Here we report the almost complete (1) H, (13) C and (15) N assignment of a fragment of M 2 - 1 corresponding to this region, for further structure determination and interaction studies...|$|E
40|$|Amide-inducible {{expression}} of the aliphatic amidase system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be reconstituted in Escherichia coli with only the amidase structural gene amiE, the negative regulator amiC and the positive regulator amiR, a transcription <b>antitermination</b> <b>factor.</b> Complementation experiments in E. coli suggest that negative control of amidase expression by AmiC is mediated by a protein-protein interaction with AmiR. Purified AmiC binds acetamide with a KD of 3. 7 microM in equilibrium dialysis studies, and therefore AmiC {{appears to be the}} sensory partner of the AmiC/AmiR pair of regulatory proteins, responding to the presence of amides. Sequence analysis techniques suggest that AmiC {{is a member of the}} structural family of periplasmic binding proteins, but has a distinct and novel cytoplasmic role...|$|E
40|$|Processive {{transcription}} antitermination {{requires the}} assembly of the complete antitermination complex, which is initiated by {{the formation of the}} ternary NusB–NusE–BoxA RNA complex. We have elucidated the crystal structure of this complex, demonstrating that the BoxA RNA is composed of 8 [*]nt that are recognized by the NusB–NusE heterodimer. Functional biologic and biophysical data support the structural observations and establish the relative significance of key protein–protein and protein–RNA interactions. Further crystallographic investigation of a NusB–NusE–dsRNA complex reveals a heretofore unobserved dsRNA binding site contiguous with the BoxA binding site. We propose that the observed dsRNA represents BoxB RNA, as both single-stranded BoxA and double-stranded BoxB components are present in the classical lambda antitermination site. Combining these data with known interactions amongst <b>antitermination</b> <b>factors</b> suggests a specific model for {{the assembly of}} the complete antitermination complex...|$|R
40|$|Using an {{in vitro}} {{transcription}} assay, we have successfully demonstrated read through of a Rho-dependent terminator by the ribosomal RNA antitermination system. The assay used a DNA template containing a promoter-antiterminator-terminator arrangement, RNA polymerase, termination <b>factor</b> Rho, <b>antitermination</b> <b>factors</b> NusA, NusB, NusE, and NusG, and a cellular extract depleted of NusB. Terminator read-through was highly efficient only {{in the presence of}} the extract and Nus factors, suggesting that an as yet uncharacterized cellular component is required for ribosomal antitermination. The NusB-depleted extract had no activity in the absence of NusB, confirming an absolute requirement for this protein in ribosomal RNA antitermination. The DNA template requirements were the same as those previously established in vivo; transcription of a wild-type boxA sequence is both necessary and sufficient to promote RNA polymerase modification into a terminator-resistant form...|$|R
40|$|Two {{mutations}} in the ninR region of bacteriophage lambda that bypass {{a requirement for}} antitermination have been studied. One mutation, byp, has been cloned and mapped by marker rescue to a 417 -base-pair segment in the ninR region of the genome. Analysis of the byp mutation by using promoter detection vectors, DNA sequencing, and S 1 nuclease analysis showed that the byp mutation created a new promoter that transcribed gene Q. The second mutation analyzed was the deletion nin 3. Sequence analysis revealed that 2, 485 base pairs of the ninR region were removed, beginning within the ren gene and ending in an open reading frame termed ninG. The tR 2 and tR 3 terminators, and probably others, were removed by the nin 3 deletion, thereby allowing the phage to be N independent and to grow in hosts defective for Nus <b>antitermination</b> <b>factors...</b>|$|R
40|$|The psu {{gene product}} of "phasmid" (phage-plasmid) P 4 {{acts as a}} {{transcription}} <b>antitermination</b> <b>factor</b> in trans and in cis, respectively, within the morphogenic operons of its P 2 phage helper during lytic viral development and on P 4 itself during the establishment stage of its alternative mode of propagation as a plasmid. Here we show that psu also antagonizes activity of the Escherichia coli transcription termination factor rho at the terminator of the trp operon. Such a finding provides to our knowledge the first direct evidence for antitermination activity at a known rho-dependent site by the psu gene product. It also reveals {{an example of an}} extrachromosomal gene product that acts on specific sites of three different genomes to regulate expression of unlinked families of genes...|$|E

The domain interaction involves a dynamic equilibrium between open and closed states and contributes significantly to the overall fold stability of the protein.

40|$|SummaryThe {{bacteriophage}} λ Q {{protein is}} a transcription <b>antitermination</b> <b>factor</b> that controls {{expression of the}} phage late genes as a stable component of the transcription elongation complex. To join the elongation complex, λQ binds a specific DNA sequence element and interacts with RNA polymerase that is paused during early elongation. λQ binds to the paused early-elongation complex through interactions between λQ and two regions of RNA polymerase: region 4 of the σ 70 subunit and the flap region of the β subunit. We present the 2. 1  Å resolution crystal structure of a portion of λQ containing determinants for interaction with DNA, interaction with region 4 of σ 70, and interaction with the β flap. The structure provides a framework for interpreting prior genetic and biochemical analysis and {{sets the stage for}} future structural studies to elucidate the mechanism by which λQ alters the functional properties of the transcription elongation complex...|$|E
40|$|The {{heterogeneous}} nuclear ribonucleoprotein Npl 3 p of {{budding yeast}} is a substrate of arginine methyltransferase Hmt 1 p, but {{the role of}} Hmt 1 p in regulating Npl 3 p’s functions in tran-scription antitermination and elongation were unknown. We found that mutants lacking Hmt 1 p methyltransferase activity exhibit reduced recruitment of Npl 3 p, but elevated recruitment of a component of mRNA cleavage/termination factor CFI, to the activated GAL 10 -GAL 7 locus. Consistent with this, hmt 1 mutants displayed increased termination at the defective gal 10 -D 56 terminator. Remarkably, hmt 1 D cells also exhibit dimin-ished recruitment of elongation factor Tho 2 p and a reduced rate of transcription elongation in vivo. Importantly, the defects in Npl 3 p and Tho 2 p recruitment, antitermination and elongation in hmt 1 D cells all were mitigated by substitutions in Npl 3 p RGG repeats that functionally mimic arginine methylation by Hmt 1 p. Thus, Hmt 1 p promotes elongation and suppresses termination at cryptic terminators by methylating RGG repeats in Npl 3 p. As Hmt 1 p stimulates dissociation of Tho 2 p from an Npl 3 p-mRNP complex, it could act to recycle these elongation and <b>antitermination</b> <b>factors</b> back to sites of ongoing transcription...|$|R
40|$|Transcript {{elongation}} and termination in Escherichia coli is modulated, in part, by the nusA gene product, an acidic {{protein that}} interacts {{not only with}} RNA polymerase itself but also with ancillary factors, namely the host termination protein Rho and phage λ antitermination protein, N. The E. coli nusA 1 mutant fails to support λ development due to a specific defect in N-mediated antitermination. Certain rifampicin-resistant (rif(R)) variants of the nusA 1 host support λ growth. We report here the isolation and pleiotropic properties of one such rif(R) mutant, ts 8, resulting from a single amino acid substitution mutation in rpoB, the structural gene for polymerase β subunit. ts 8 is a recessive lethal mutation that blocks cell growth at 42 °. Pulse-labeling and analysis of newly synthesized proteins indicate that the mutant cell is proficient in RNA synthesis at high temperature. Apparently, ts 8 causes a loss of some specialized function of RNA polymerase without a gross defect in general transcription activities. ts 8 is an allele-specific suppressor of nusA 1. It does not suppress nusAsal, nusB 5 and nusE 71 mutations nor does it bypass the requirement for a functional N gene and the nut site for antitermination and λ growth. A mutation in the N gene, punA 1, that restores λ growth in the nusA 1 mutant host {{but not in the}} nusAsal host, compensates for the nusAsal allele in the ts 8 mutant. This combined effect of two allele-specific suppressors suggests that they enhance some aspect of polymerase-NusA-N interaction and function. ts 8 suppresses the rho 15 mutation, but not the rho 112 mutation, indicating that it might render RNA polymerase susceptible to the action of a defective Rho protein. Marker rescue analysis has localized ts 8 to a 910 -bp internal segment of rpoB that encodes the Rif domain. By amplification, cloning and sequencing of this segment of the mutant chromosome we have determined that ts 8 contains Phe in place of Ser 522, caused by a C to T transition. By gene conversion, we have established that the simultaneous gain and loss of three functions of polymerase is caused by this single amino acid substitution. Clearly, a site in the β subunit critical for the functioning of both termination and <b>antitermination</b> <b>factors</b> is altered by ts 8. The alteration, we imagine, might make this site on polymerase receptive to some factors but repulsive to others...|$|R

40|$|Escherichia coli group 2 capsule gene {{clusters}} are temperature regulated, being expressed at 37 °C {{but not at}} 20 °C. Expression {{is regulated}} {{at the level of}} transcription by two convergent promoters, PR 1 and PR 3. In this paper, we show that regulation of transcription from PR 3 involves a number of novel features including H-NS, SlyA, and a large 741 -bp 5 ′ untranslated region (UTR). H-NS represses transcription from PR 3 at 20 °C and binds both 5 ′ and 3 ′ of the transcription start site. The 3 ′ downstream regulatory element (DRE) was essential for temperature-dependent H-NS repression. At 37 °C, SlyA activates transcription independent of H-NS but maximal transcription requires H-NS. The UTR is present between the transcription start site and the first gene in the operon, kpsM. We demonstrate that the UTR, as well as containing the H-NS DRE, functions to moderate the extent of transcription that reaches kpsM and allows the binding of <b>antitermination</b> <b>factor</b> RfaH...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can be {{recovered}} from plasmids that separately encode antigenomic RNA and the N, P, L, and M 2 - 1 proteins of the nucleocapsid. However, {{in a recent}} study the inclusion of a separate M 2 - 1 expression plasmid was found to be unnecessary (H. Jin, D. Clarke, H. Zhou, X. Cheng, K. Coelingh, M. Bryant, and S. Li, Virology 1998, 251, 206 – 214). This suggested that the M 2 - 1 protein, which is a transcription <b>antitermination</b> <b>factor,</b> is not required to reconstitute the minimum unit of infectivity, namely a nucleocapsid fully functional for viral transcription and RNA replication. Here we show that the antigenomic plasmid is remarkably efficient as a substitute for an M 2 - 1 expression plasmid in supporting processive transcription by an RSV minigenome. Thus, the simple expedient of omitting an expression plasmid is invalid for evaluating recovery requirements. The issue of the requirement of M 2 - 1 for the recovery of infectious RSV is discussed...|$|E

For human metapneumovirus (hMPV), an H- 2 d-restricted CTL epitope in the M 2 - 2 protein has been described. In this study, we screened the hMPV F, G, N, M, M 2 - 1, and M 2 - 2 proteins using three independent algorithms to predict H- 2 d CTL epitopes in BALB/c mice. A dominant epitope (GYIDDNQSI) in positions 81 to 89 of the <b>antitermination</b> <b>factor</b> M 2 - 1 and a subdominant epitope (SPKAGLLSL) in N 307 - 315 were detected during the anti-hMPV CTL response. Passive transfer of CD 8 + T-cell lines against M 2 - 181 - 89 and N 307 - 315 protected Rag 1 −/− mice against hMPV challenge. Interestingly, diversification of CTL targets to include multiple epitopes was observed after repetitive infections. A subdominant response against the previously described M 2 - 2 epitope was detected after the third infection. An understanding of the CTL response against hMPV is important for developing preventive and therapeutic strategies against the virus...|$|E
40|$|Using in vitro-constructed deletions and subcloned DNA fragments, we have {{identified}} a new gene, amiC, which regulates expression of the inducible Pseudomonas aeruginosa aliphatic amidase activity. The DNA sequence of the gene has been determined, and an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 385 amino acids (molecular mass, 42, 834 Da) has been identified. A search of sequence libraries has failed to find homologies with other published sequences. The amiC translation termination codon (A) TGA overlaps the initiation codon for the downstream amiR transcription <b>antitermination</b> <b>factor</b> gene, implying that the amiCR operon is coordinately regulated. Disruption of the amiC open reading frame by insertion and deletion leads to constitutive amidase synthesis, suggesting that AmiC is a negative regulator. This is confirmed by the finding that a broad-host-range expression vector carrying amiC (pSW 41) represses amidase expression {{in a series of}} previously characterized P. aeruginosa amidase-constitutive mutants.

40|$|The crystal {{structure}} for the negative regulator (AmiC) of the amidase operon from Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been solved at a resolution of 2. 1 A. AmiC is the amide sensor protein in the amidase operon and regulates {{the activity of the}} transcription <b>antitermination</b> <b>factor</b> AmiR, which in turn regulates amidase expression. The AmiC structure consists of two domains with an alternating beta-alpha-beta topology. The two domains are separated by a central cleft and the amide binding site is positioned in this cleft at the interface of the domains. The overall fold for AmiC is extremely similar to that for the leucine-isoleucine-valine binding protein (LivJ) of Escherichia coli despite only 17 % sequence identity, however, the two domains of AmiC are substantially closed compared with LivJ. The closed structure of AmiC is stabilized significantly by the bound acetamide, suggesting a molecular mechanism for the process of amide induction. The amide binding site is extremely specific for acetamide and would not allow a closed conformation {{in the presence of the}} anti-inducer molecule butyramide...|$|E

Pathogenic Brucella species adapted to an intracellular lifestyle have two genes involved in riboflavin synthesis, ribH 1 and ribH 2, which are located on different chromosomes. The ribH 2 gene was shown previously to specify a lumazine synthase (type II lumazine synthase) with an unusual decameric structure and a very high Km for 3, 4 -dihydroxy- 2 -butanone 4 -phosphate. Moreover, the protein {{was found to be}} an immunodominant Brucella antigen and was able to generate strong humoral as well as cellular immunity against Brucella abortus in mice. We have now cloned and expressed the ribH 1 gene, which is located inside a small riboflavin operon, together with two other putative riboflavin biosynthesis genes and the nusB gene, specifying an <b>antitermination</b> <b>factor.</b> The RibH 1 protein (type I lumazine synthase) is a homopentamer catalyzing the formation of 6, 7 -dimethyl- 8 -ribityllumazine at a rate of 18 nmol mg− 1 min− 1.

40|$|The {{first step}} in the {{replication}} of influenza virion RNAs is the synthesis of full-length transcripts of these RNAs. The synthesis of these transcripts, or template RNAs, requires: unprimed initiation rather than the capped RNA-primed initiation used during viral mRNA synthesis, and antitermination at the polyadenylylation site used during mRNA synthesis. To determine the mechanism of template RNA synthesis, we prepared nuclear extracts from infected cells that were active in the synthesis of both template RNAs and viral mRNAs. By providing the dinucleotide ApG as primer, we circumvented the inefficient unprimed initiation catalyzed by these extracts and, as a consequence, were able to focus on the antitermination step. Antitermination, and hence template RNA synthesis, occurred when ApG but not a capped RNA was used as primer, indicating that the presence of a 5 ' capped end blocked antitermination at the 3 ' end of the transcript. Ultracentrifugation of the nuclear extract yielded a pellet fraction that contained viral nucleocapsids active in viral mRNA synthesis but not template RNA synthesis and a supernatant fraction that contained the <b>antitermination</b> <b>factor.</b> When the supernatant, which had essentially no activity by itself, was added to the pellet in the presence of ApG, template RNA synthesis was restored. Depletion experiments in which this supernatant was incubated with protein A-Sepharose containing antibodies to individual viral proteins demonstrated that the viral nucleocapsid protein was required for antitermination. The implications of these results for the control of viral RNA replication are discussed...|$|E

Unlike members of the Paramyxovirinae subfamily, the polymerase complex of pneumovi-ruses requires an additional cofactor, the M 2 - 1 protein, which functions as a transcriptional <b>antitermination</b> <b>factor.</b> TheM 2 - 1 protein was found to incorporate zinc ions, although the specific role(s) of the zinc binding activity in viral replication and pathogenesis remains unknown. In this study, we found that the third cysteine (C 21) and the last histidine (H 25) in the zinc binding motif (CCCH) of hMPVM 2 - 1 were essential for zinc binding activity, whereas the first two cysteines (C 7 and C 15) play only minor or redundant roles in zinc binding. In addition, the zinc binding motif is essential for the oligomerization of M 2 - 1. Subsequently, recombinant hMPVs (rhMPVs) carrying mutations in the zinc binding motif were recovered. Interestingly, rhMPV-C 21 S and-H 25 Lmutants, which lacked zinc binding activity, had delayed replication in cell culture and were highly at-tenuated in cotton rats. In contrast, rhMPV-C 7 S and-C 15 S strains, which retained 60 % of the zinc binding activity, replicated as efficiently as rhMPV in cotton rats. Importantly, rhMPVs that lacked zinc binding activity triggered high levels of neutralizing antibody and provided complete protection against challenge with rhMPV. Taken together, these results demonstrate that zinc binding activity is indispensable for viral replication and pathogenesis in vivo.

It contains a CCCH motif at the N-terminus, a putative zinc-binding domain that is essential for M 2 - 1 function. To gain insight into its structural organization, M 2 - 1 was produced as a recombinant protein in E. coli and purified to > 95 % homogeneity using a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag. The GST-M 2 - 1 fusion proteins were co-purified with bacterial RNA that could be eliminated by high salt wash. Circular dichroism showed that M 2 - 1 is largely alpha-helical. Chemical cross-linking, dynamic light scattering, sedimentation velocity and electron microscopy led to the conclusion that M 2 - 1 forms a 5. 4 S tetramer of 89 kDa and of approximately 7. 6 nm in diameter at micromolar concentrations. By using a series of deletion mutants, the oligomerization domain of M 2 - 1 was mapped to a putative alpha-helix consisting of amino acid residues 32 - 63. When tested in an RSV minigenome replicon system using luciferase as a reporter gene, a M 2 - 1 deletion mutant lacking this region showed a significant reduction in RNA transcription compared to wild-type M 2 - 1, indicating that M 2 - 1 oligomerization is essential for its activity.

40|$|The M 2 - 1 protein of {{respiratory}} syncytial (RS) virus is a transcriptional processivity and <b>antitermination</b> <b>factor.</b> The M 2 - 1 protein has a Cys 3 His 1 zinc binding motif which {{is essential for}} function, is phosphorylated, and {{has been shown to}} interact with the RS virus nucleocapsid (N) protein. In the work reported here, we determined the sites at which the M 2 - 1 protein was phosphorylated and investigated the importance of these phosphorylated residues for M 2 - 1 function in transcription. By combining protease digestion, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry, and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified the phosphorylated residues as serines 58 and 61, not threonine 56 and serine 58 as previously reported. Serines 58 and 61 and the surrounding amino acids are in a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by casein kinase I. Consistent with this, we showed that the unphosphorylated M 2 - 1 protein synthesized in Escherichia coli could be phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinase I. The effect of eliminating phosphorylation by site-specific mutagenesis of serines 58 and 61 on the function of the M 2 - 1 protein in transcription of RS virus subgenomic replicons was assayed. The activities of the M 2 - 1 protein phosphorylation mutants in transcriptional antitermination were tested over a range of concentrations and were found to be substantially inhibited at all concentrations. The data show that phosphorylation is important for the M 2 - 1 protein function in transcription. However, mutation of the M 2 - 1 phosphorylation sites did not interfere with the ability of the M 2 - 1 protein to interact with the N protein in transfected cells. The interaction of the M 2 - 1 and N proteins in cotransfected cells was found to be sensitive to RNase A, indicating that the M 2 - 1 –N protein interaction was mediated via RNA.

40|$|M 2 - 1 protein {{of human}} {{respiratory}} syncytial virus (RSV) is a transcription <b>antitermination</b> <b>factor</b> that {{is important for the}} efficient synthesis of full-length mRNAs {{as well as for the}} synthesis of polycistronic readthrough mRNAs, which are characteristic of nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses. The contributions of these effects to RSV sequential transcription were investigated with minigenomes which contained one to five genes which were either foreign marker genes or authentic RSV genes. When evaluated on a promoter-proximal gene, the effect of M 2 - 1 on the synthesis of full-length mRNA was much greater for a long (1, 212 - or 1, 780 -nucleotide) gene (up to a 615 -fold increase) than for a short (274 -nucleotide) gene (less than a 2 -fold increase). This was independent of whether the gene contained non-RSV or RSV-specific sequence. Once the polymerase had terminated prematurely, it was unable to reinitiate at a downstream gene. These studies also confirmed that M 2 - 1 enhances the synthesis of polycistronic mRNAs and that the magnitude of this effect varied greatly among different naturally occurring gene junctions. The synthesis of polycistronic mRNAs, which presumably involves antitermination at the gene-end signal, required a higher level of M 2 - 1 than did the synthesis of the corresponding monocistronic mRNAs. M 2 - 1 did not have a comparable antitermination effect at the junction between the leader region and the first gene. In a minigenome containing the NS 1 and NS 2 genes in their authentic sequence context, synthesis of full-length NS 1 and NS 2 mRNAs in the absence of M 2 - 1 was remarkably high (36 and 57 %, respectively, of the maximum levels observed in the presence of M 2 - 1). In contrast, synthesis of mRNA from additional downstream genes was highly dependent on M 2 - 1. Thus, RSV has the potential for two transcription programs: one in the absence of M 2 - 1, in which only the NS 1 and NS 2 genes are transcribed, and one in the presence of M 2 - 1, in which sequential transcription of the complete genome occurs. The dependence on M 2 - 1 for transcription was greater for a gene in the fifth position from the promoter than for one in the third position. This indicates that under conditions where M 2 - 1 is limiting, its concentration affects the gradient of transcription. Although M 2 - 1 was found to have profound effects on transcription, it had no effect on replication of any minigenome tested, suggesting that it is not an active participant in RNA replication or regulation of RNA replication. Finally, since a permissive RSV infection is marked by a gradual increase in the intracellular accumulation of viral proteins including M 2 - 1, we examined the relative abundances of various mRNAs during RSV infection for evidence of temporal regulation of transcription. None was found, implying that the availability of M 2 - 1 during a permissive infection is sufficient at all times such that its concentration does not mediate temporal regulation of gene transcription...|$|E
