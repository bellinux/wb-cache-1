Young, athletic, {{sergeant major}} Negoiţa was a beautiful man, blond, with shining blue eyes, straw colored hair, pouring down in stripes from under the helmet. Dashing and cheerful, {{he looked like a}} soviet actor who specialized in heroic roles. Wide shoulders, tighten hips and, underneath his well fitted uniform, the harmonious pack of muscles was remarkable. What was such a perfect specimen doing in that place was an enigma to me. His rightful place was in the arena, on the running track or in the swimming pool, breaking records and bathing in the ovations of the crowd. He came towards me and, without any effort or soar, floating like, jumped straight onto my bed, which was a meter and a half high. ... He gave me this long, genteel look, full of compassion. Recalling my childhood, when I fell ill, his bright eyes, as blue and serene as my grandmothers, were bringing comfort. I knew then that the man standing in front of me will help, that he will call the doctor, and if not will carry me himself {{all the way to the}} infirmary. He did not choose this beaten track, but one of total involvement. All of a sudden, bending his knees and arching his legs, with the same ease that brought him up onto the bed, he jumped both feet on my chest. And he started to walk. Methodical, and passionate. His favorite strolling place were my chest and abdomen, but he was not reluctant towards my head or feet as well. He was dancing on top of me like he was at a weeding. ...It felt more like <b>a</b> <b>initiation</b> dance, a ritual born to a ancient culture where the dancer became one with the healer, and the dancing healer became one with the suffering.

We tested whether early treatment with high-dose interferon (IFN) beta- 1 a, known to reduce inflammatory activity, improves cortical function and cognitive deficits in MS. Eighty treatment-naïve relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients received IFN beta- 1 a (44 mcg) subcutaneously three times per week. Cognitive performance and cortical plasticity were measured through the paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT) and intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) before and {{up to two years}} after IFN beta- 1 <b>a</b> <b>initiation.</b> Before treatment, patients with gadolinium-enhancing lesions (Gd+) on MRI performed worse on the PASAT, and showed lower iTBS-induced plasticity, compared with Gd- patients.

These parameters have been calculated for a number of chemical agents, based both on data from this laboratory and others published in the literature. Neither parameter varied significantly with the dose of two different initiating agents used in this study. The range of promotion indices extended over more than eight orders of magnitude, whereas that of the initiation indices was much less variable.

40|$|AbstractThe sobemoviruses {{have one}} of the {{smallest}} of all known RNA virus genomes. ORF 1 encodes P 1 which plays a role in suppression of silencing and virus movement, ORFs 2 a and 2 b encode the replicational polyproteins P 2 a and P 2 ab, and ORF 3 encodes the coat protein. Translation of ORF 2 a from the genomic RNA is dependent on a leaky scanning mechanism. We report the presence of an additional ORF (ORFx), conserved in all sobemoviruses. ORFx overlaps the 5 ′ end of ORF 2 a in the + 2 reading frame and also extends some distance upstream of ORF 2 a. ORFx lacks an AUG initiation codon and its expression is predicted to depend on low level initiation at near-cognate non-AUG codons, such as CUG, by a proportion of the ribosomes that are scanning the region between the ORF 1 and ORF 2 <b>a</b> <b>initiation</b> codons.

40|$|The {{neural crest}} (NC) emerges from {{combinatorial}} inductive events occurring within its progenitor domain, the neural border (NB). Several transcription factors act early at the NB, but the initiating molecular events remain elusive. Recent data from basal vertebrates suggest that ap 2 {{might have been}} critical for NC emergence; however, the role of AP 2 factors at the NB remains unclear. We show here that AP 2 a initiates NB patterning and is sufficient to elicit a NB-like pattern in neuralized ectoderm. In contrast, the other early regulators {{do not participate in}} ap 2 <b>a</b> <b>initiation</b> at the NB, but cooperate to further establish a robust NB pattern. The NC regulatory network uses a multistep cascade of secreted inducers and transcription factors, first at the NB and then within the NC progenitors. Here we report that AP 2 a acts at two distinct steps of this cascade. As the earliest known NB specifier, AP 2 a mediates Wnt signals to initiate the NB and activate pax 3; as a NC specifier, AP 2 a regulates further NC development independent of and downstream of NB patterning. Our findings reconcile conflicting observations from various vertebrate organisms. AP 2 a provides a paradigm for the reiterated use of multifunctional molecules, thereby facilitating emergence of the NC in vertebrates...|$|E
40|$|Adequate {{medication}} adherence is key {{for optimal}} benefit of pharmacological treatments. A wealth {{of research has}} been conducted to understand and identify opportunities to intervene to improve medication adherence, but variations in adherence definitions within prior research have led to ambiguity in study findings. The lack of a standard taxonomy hinders the development of cumulative science in adherence research. This article reviews the newly established Ascertaining Barriers to Compliance (ABC) taxonomy for medication adherence with a particular focus on its relevance and applicability within the context of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management. Building on traditional definitions and concepts within medication adherence, the ABC taxonomy considers the temporal sequence of steps a patient must undertake to be defined as " adherent to treatment": (<b>A)</b> <b>initiation,</b> (B) implementation, and (C) persistence. We explain the clinical and research relevance of differentiating between these phases, point to differences in its applicability in observational and experimental research, review strengths and limitations of available measures, and highlight recent findings on specific determinants of these behaviors. Finally, we provide recommendations for research and practice with a view to supporting and sign posting opportunities to improve future respiratory medication adherence and associated research.

40|$|The G 20210 A {{mutation}} in the prothrombin gene is an established {{risk factor for}} venous thrombosis. There is controversy {{about the role of}} this {{mutation in}} arterial thrombotic disease and atherosclerosis. We determined the presence of the prothrombin mutation and examined its influence on carotid and femoral artery intima-media thickness (IMT) and the occurrence of new ischemic events during follow-up in 277 patients with clinically manifest atherosclerotic disease: ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or peripheral arterial disease. The mean age at entry was 63 years. Mean IMT was significantly higher in carriers of the prothrombin Mutation (1. 17 (SD 0. 29) mm versus 0. 97 (SD 0. 25) mm: deltaIMT= 0. 20, P= 0. 02). The increase in IMT was not attributable to differences in age, type of arterial disease or cardiovascular risk factors between carriers and non-carriers. During a mean follow-up of 3. 5 years, a strong trend for more ischemic events was observed: 4 of the 11 carriers suffered from a recurrent ischemic event, compared with 30 of the 164 male non-carriers (36 versus 18 %,; P = 0. 06).

40|$|To {{investigate}} the checkpoint response to aberrant initiation, we analyzed the cell cycle checkpoint response induced by mutations of Schizosaccharomyces pombe DNA primase. DNA primase has two subunits, Spp 1 and Spp 2 (S. pombe primases 1 and 2). Spp 1 is the catalytic subunit that synthesizes the RNA primer, {{which is then}} extended by DNA polymerase α (Polα) to synthesize an initiation DNA structure, and this catalytic function of Polα {{is a prerequisite for}} generating the S-M phase checkpoint. Here we show that Spp 2 is required for coupling the function of Spp 1 to Polα. Thermosensitive mutations of spp 2 + destabilize the Polα-primase complex, resulting in an allele-specific S phase checkpoint defect. The mutant exhibiting a more severe checkpoint defect also has a higher extent of Polα-primase complex instability and deficiency in the hydroxyurea-induced Cds 1 -mediated intra-S phase checkpoint response. However, this mutant is able to activate the Cds 1 response to S phase arrest induced by temperature. These findings suggest that the Cds 1 response to the S-phase arrest signal(s) induced by <b>a</b> <b>initiation</b> mutant is different from that induced by hydroxyurea. Interestingly, a polαts mutant with a defective S-M phase checkpoint and an spp 2 mutant with an intact checkpoint have a similar Polα-primase complex stability, and the Cds 1 response induced by hydroxyurea or by the mutant arrests at the restrictive temperature. Thus, the Cds 1 -mediated intra-S phase checkpoint response induced by hydroxyurea can also be distinguished from the S-M phase checkpoint response that requires the initiation DNA synthesis by Polα...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Dental caries (decay) is an {{international}} public health challenge, especially amongst young children. Early Childhood Caries is a rapidly progressing disease leading to severe pain, anxiety, sepsis and sleep loss, and is a major health problem particularly for disadvantaged populations. There is currently a lack of research exploring the interactions between risk and protective factors {{in the development of}} early childhood caries, in particular the effects of infant feeding practises. Methods/Design This is an observational cohort study and involves the recruitment of a birth cohort from disadvantaged communities in South Western Sydney. Mothers will be invited to join the study soon after the birth of their child {{at the time of the}} first home visit by Child and Family Health Nurses. Data on feeding practices and dental health behaviours will be gathered utilizing a telephone interview at 4, 8 and 12 months, and thereafter at 6 monthly intervals until the child is aged 5 years. Information collected will include <b>a)</b> <b>initiation</b> and duration of breastfeeding, b) introduction of solid food, c) intake of cariogenic and non-cariogenic foods, d) fluoride exposure, and e) oral hygiene practices. Children will have a dental and anthropometric examination at 2 and 5 years of age and the main outcome measures will be oral health quality of life, caries prevalence and caries incidence. Discussion This study will provide evidence of the association of early childhood feeding practices and the oral health of preschool children. In addition, information will be collected on breastfeeding practices and the oral health concerns of mothers living in disadvantaged areas in South Western Sydney. </p...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis C {{virus is}} a poor inducer of {{interferon}} (IFN), although its structured viral RNA can bind the RNA helicase RIG-I, and activate the IFN-induction pathway. Low IFN induction {{has been attributed to}} HCV NS 3 / 4 A protease-mediated cleavage of the mitochondria-adapter MAVS. Here, we have investigated the early events of IFN induction upon HCV infection, using the cell-cultured HCV JFH 1 strain and the new HCV-permissive hepatoma-derived Huh 7. 25. CD 81 cell subclone. These cells depend on ectopic expression of the RIG-I ubiquitinating enzyme TRIM 25 to induce IFN through the RIG-I/MAVS pathway. We observed induction of IFN during the first 12 hrs of HCV infection, after which a decline occurred which was more abrupt at the protein than at the RNA level, revealing a novel HCV-mediated control of IFN induction at the level of translation. The cellular protein kinase PKR is an important regulator of translation, through the phosphorylation of its substrate the eIF 2 <b>a</b> <b>initiation</b> factor. A comparison of the expression of luciferase placed under the control of an eIF 2 adependent (IRES EMCV) or independent (IRES HCV) RNA showed a specific HCV-mediated inhibition of eIF 2 a-dependent translation. We demonstrated that HCV infection triggers the phosphorylation of both PKR and eIF 2 a at 12 and 15 hrs postinfection. PKR silencing, as well as treatment with PKR pharmacological inhibitors, restored IFN induction in JFH 1 -infected cells, at least until 18 hrs post-infection, at which time a decrease in IFN expression could be attributed to NS 3 / 4 A-mediated MAVS cleavage. Importantly, both PKR silencing and PKR inhibitors led to inhibition of HCV yields in cells that expres...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{plasmids}} and mutant derivatives containing fusions of the Escherichia coli galactokinase gene, galK, to the yeast iso- 1 -cytochrome c CYC 1 transcription unit {{were used to}} study the sequences affecting the initiation of translation in S. cerevisiae. When the CYC 1 AUG initiation codon preceded the galK AUG codon and coding sequence and either the two AUGs were out of frame with each other or a nonsense codon was located between them, {{the expression of the}} galK gene was extremely low. Deletion of the CYC 1 AUG and its surrounding sequences resulted in a 100 -fold increase in galK expression. This dependence of galK expression on the elimination of the CYC 1 AUG codon was used to select mutations in that codon. Then the ability of these altered initiation codons to serve in translational initiation was determined by reconstruction of the CYC 1 gene 3 ' to and in frame with them. Initiation was found to occur at the codons UUG and AUA, but not at the codons AAA and AUC. Furthermore the codon UUG, when preceded by an A three nucleotides upstream, served as a better initiation codon than when a U was substituted for the A. The efficiency of translation from these non-AUG codons was quantitated by using a CYC 1 /galK protein-coding fusion and measuring cellular galactokinase levels. Initiation at the UUG codon was 6. 9 % as efficient as initiation at the wild-type AUG codon when preceded by an A three nucleotides upstream, but was over 10 -fold less efficient when a U was substituted for that <b>A.</b> <b>Initiation</b> at AUA was 0. 5 % as efficient as at AUG.
