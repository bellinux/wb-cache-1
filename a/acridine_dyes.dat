40|$|<b>Acridine</b> <b>dye</b> binding by {{cells of}} Escherichia coli has been {{characterized}} {{in terms of a}} number of parameters. There is a temperature-dependent, readily reversible binding of acriflavine which occurs to a greater extent with acridine-sensitive mutants of E. coli K- 12 than with wild-type E. coli B or K- 12. There is an essentially irreversible internal binding of acriflavine which occurs when the cellular permeability barriers are destroyed or altered by heat-treatment, elevated pH, treatment with toluene or phenethyl alcohol, or infection with bacteriophage T 2 or T 4. Both the reversible and the irreversible binding of acridines occurs more effectively with the <b>acridine</b> <b>dye</b> acriflavine than with the related dye proflavine, and still less effectively with 9 -aminoacridine and quinacrine. These properties of acridine binding can be correlated with various inhibitory effects of the dyes on the cells...|$|R

The 9 -amino group of the <b>acridine</b> <b>dye</b> was linked through a polymethylene bridge to the 3 '-phosphate, the 5 '-phosphate, the fourth internucleotidic phosphate or to both the 3 '- and 5 '-phosphates. Different interactions of the <b>acridine</b> <b>dye</b> were exhibited by these different substituted oligodeoxynucleotides when they bind to poly(rA). The interaction was shown to be specific for adenine-containing polynucleotides. The stability of these complexes was compared with that of oligodeoxynucleotides substituted by an alkyl group on the 3 '-phosphate. The increase in stability due to the presence of the intercalating dye has been determined from the comparison of melting temperatures.

Transfer of triplet electronic excitation {{energy from the}} purine and/or pyrimidine moities of native DNA and adenine polynucleotides to the <b>acridine</b> <b>dye</b> 9 -aminoacridine has been demonstrated at 77 [degrees] K. The occurrence of such transfers indicates that there is pi electron overlap between the purine and/or pyrimidine bases and the dye bound to the polymer. The <b>acridine</b> <b>dye</b> has then {{been used as a}} trap for the polymer triplet excitation energy. The polymer to dye dependence of the base to dye transfer efficiency indicates that triplet energy is delocalized in native DNA and adenine polynucleotides. Kinetic studies provide evidence that the pathlength for triplet energy transfer in native DNA is determined by trapping within the polymer rather than by diffusion. Delayed fluorescence from the dye bound to DNA has been observed and its origin in the triplet state of the polymer has been confirmed at high polymer to dye ratios.

40|$|Oligothymidylates {{involving}} alternating alkyl phosphotriester-phosphodiester or methylphosphonate-phosphodiester backbones and covalently {{linked to}} an acridine derivative have been studied using circular dichroism. Two isomers with the same diastereoisomeric configuration for all the phosphotriesters (ethyl triester and neopentyl triester) or the methylphosphonate linkages were studied. These six compounds were compared to the parent oligonucleotide with unmodified phosphodiester bonds. Intramolecular interactions between the acridine and the bases of the oligonucleotides were revealed by the induced circular dichroism of the <b>acridine</b> <b>dye.</b> Binding to poly(rA) and poly(dA) induced large changes in the circular dichroism signal. All oligothymidylates formed double-stranded complexes with poly(rA). Substitution of phosphotriesters and methylphosphonates to phosphates allowed both double- and triple-stranded structures to be formed with with poly(dA). The double-stranded structures formed with poly(rA) and poly(dA) were characterized by different environments of the <b>acridine</b> <b>dye.</b> The circular dichroism spectra of the complexes with poly(dA) and the thermal stabilities of the complexes formed with both poly(rA) and poly(dA) were drastically dependent of the diastereoisomeric configuration of the phosphate modification.

We have now isolated and characterized mini-F mutants that can overcome the replication inhibition. Such plasmids, designated pom (permissive on maf), were obtained spontaneously or after mutagenesis with hydroxylamine or by transposon (Tn 3) insertion. In addition to their ability to replicate in mafA mutant bacteria, the pom mutant plasmids exhibit an increased copy number and resistance to "curing" by <b>acridine</b> <b>dye</b> in the mafA+ host. In agreement with these results, Tn 3 -induced pom mutants were found to carry Tn 3 inserted at the incC region of mini-F DNA, known to be involved in incompatibility, control of copy number, and sensitivity to <b>acridine</b> <b>dye.</b> Furthermore, three of the seven mini-F plasmids tested that carry Tn 3 within the tandem repeat sequences of the incC region (previously isolated by other workers) exhibit all the phenotypes of pom plasmids, the ability to replicate in the mafA strain, and high copy number and acridine resistance in the mafA+ strain. The rest of the plasmids that contain Tn 3 just outside the tandem repeats remain wild type in all these properties.

The R factor of R+ transductants was nontransmissible by cell-to-cell contact, and it was not eliminated by treatment with <b>acridine</b> <b>dye.</b> When R+ transductants were infected with F factor, the nontransmissible R factor acquired transferability by conjugation.

However, the (FR) + conjugants, to which both F and R factor were transmitted simultaneously by conjugation, were also capable of transferring their F and R factors by conjugation. From the present study, it was concluded that the recombinant (FR) factor was formed {{as a result of an}} interaction between F and R factors present in a host bacterium, and that one of the mechanisms of acquisition of transferability is accounted for by the formation of recombinant (FR) factor.

The photosensitized inactivation is enhanced when the cells are suspended in D 20 -buffer during irradiation. This indicates that singlet oxygen is involved in the inactivation. Two findings indicate that the photoinduced damage is repairable: firstly, the frac-tion of cells surviving a given light dose decreases with decreasing irradiation temperature, and secondly, the survival curves have a shoulder at low exposures of light.
