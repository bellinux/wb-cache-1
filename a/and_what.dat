(2) One who says: [...] "What's mine is yours, <b>and</b> <b>what's</b> yours is mine"; this is an unlearned person.

5000|$|Another {{passage in}} Pirkei Avot lists four {{possible}} social relationship schemes: [...] "He who says, 'What's mine is mine <b>and</b> <b>what's</b> yours is yours', is the median type, though {{some say that}} this is the quality of Sodom. He who says, 'What's mine is yours <b>and</b> <b>what's</b> yours is mine', is a simple (or, according to other readings, an ignorant) man. He who says, 'What's mine is yours <b>and</b> <b>what's</b> yours is yours', is a pious man ('Hasid'). And he who says, 'What's yours is mine, <b>and</b> <b>what's</b> mine is mine', is wicked.'" [...] (Avot, 5:13). According to Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag, consistent application of this ethical rule by all members of the society leads to voluntary communism.|$|R
