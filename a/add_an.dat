5|$|In 1995, a 60th Anniversary edition was {{released}} in a gold box. In late 1998, Hasbro announced a campaign to <b>add</b> <b>an</b> all-new token to U.S. standard edition sets of Monopoly. Voters were allowed to select from a biplane, a piggy bank, and a sack of money — with votes being tallied through a special website, via a toll-free phone number, and at FAO Schwarz stores.|$|E
5|$|Lawsuits pending (House v. Price) such {{as whether}} cost-sharing {{subsidies}} must be paid. President Trump threatened not to pay these subsidies in early 2017 and later decided to stop paying them. CBO estimated in September 2017 that discontinuing the payments would <b>add</b> <b>an</b> average of 15-20 percentage points to health insurance costs on the exchanges in 2018 while increasing the budget deficit nearly $200 billion over a decade.|$|E
5|$|Readville {{station is}} fully {{handicapped}} accessible, although accessible routes are only {{available from the}} Hyde Park Avenue entrance. Every platform includes a 1-car length ("mini-high") high-level platform, which allows passengers to board level with the train car floors. The platforms are all connected by a system of pedestrian bridges which include accessible ramps. , the MBTA is considering the addition of elevators to supplement the ramps and <b>add</b> <b>an</b> accessible route to the Milton Street parking lot.|$|E

40|$|Recently, Scholten and Read (2014) {{found new}} {{violations}} of dominance in intertemporal choice. Although <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> small receipt before a delayed payment or <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> small delayed receipt after an immediate receipt makes the prospect objectively better, it decreases {{the preference for}} that prospect (better is worse). Conversely, although <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> small payment before a delayed receipt or <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> small delayed payment after an immediate payment makes the prospect objectively worse, it increases the preference for that prospect (worse is better). Scholten and Read explained these violations {{in terms of a}} preference for improvement. However, to produce violations such as these, we find that the temporal sequences need not be constructed as Scholten and Read suggested. In this study, <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> small receipt before a dated receipt (thus constructed as improving) or <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> receipt after a dated payment (thus constructed as improving) decreases preferences for those prospects. Conversely, <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> small payment after a dated receipt (thus constructed as deteriorating) or <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> small payment before a delayed payment (thus constructed as deteriorating) increases preferences for those prospects. </p...|$|R
5|$|A polar bear—the {{guardian}} of the ice wand—raises the ice wand from beneath the ocean. The fairies <b>add</b> <b>an</b> ice wand to each planet of the Solar System. Along with the white wand at Fairy World, the ice wands create a celestial smile that projects its light into The Darkness. The smile transforms it into a bright sun, The Kindness, and Timmy concludes The Darkness was only looking for a friend. The group returns to Dimmsdale, where an Eliminator, dubbed a 'Hug'inator by Cosmo, crashes {{in front of them}} and spews out everyone who had been sucked in. Everyone parties in Fairy World and celebrates the chosen one's accomplishment.|$|E
5|$|Another element {{widely used}} by Gaudí was the {{catenary}} arch. He had studied geometry thoroughly {{when he was}} young, studying numerous articles about engineering, a field that praised {{the virtues of the}} catenary curve as a mechanical element, one which at that time, however, was used only in the construction of suspension bridges. Gaudí was the first to use this element in common architecture. Catenary arches in works like the Casa Milà, the Teresian College, the crypt of the Colònia Güell and the Sagrada Família allowed Gaudí to <b>add</b> <b>an</b> element of great strength to his structures, given that the catenary distributes the weight it regularly carries evenly, being affected only by self-canceling tangential forces.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the championship, each {{participating}} nation had to submit a list of players for its roster. A minimum of fifteen skaters and two goaltenders and a maximum of twenty skaters and three goaltenders had to be selected. A country that had selected fewer than the maximum allowed were required to choose the remaining players prior to {{the start of}} the tournament. After {{the start of the}} tournament, each team was allowed to <b>add</b> <b>an</b> additional two players to their roster, for a maximum of 25. Once players were registered to the team, they could not be removed from the roster.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1980 the {{eligibility}} year for nominations {{was set to}} the calendar year, rather than December–November as initially conceived, and the SFWA organizing panel was allowed to <b>add</b> <b>an</b> additional work. Authors were also allowed to use the mass-market paperback publication of their books {{as the beginning of}} their nomination period, rather than the initial hardback publication. As a consequence of the combination of this rule and the rolling eligibility, the 2007 awards, despite nominally being for works published in 2006, instead were all given to works initially published in 2005. Beginning with the 2010 awards, the rolling eligibility system and paperback publication exemption were replaced with the current rules.|$|E
5|$|Despondent {{over her}} Granny's lack of honesty, Red wanders off alone. Meanwhile, Nicky Flippers {{realizes that the}} one {{commonality}} between all four stories was a bunny named Boingo and concludes {{that he is the}} Goody Bandit. However, Boingo has already sneaked into the home and stolen Granny's recipes. Red sees Boingo and follows him to his hideout at a cable car station, but the police pursue him in the wrong direction. Granny, the Wolf, and Kirk manage to locate Boingo as he is explaining his evil scheme to Red. Boingo plans to <b>add</b> <b>an</b> addictive substance to the stolen recipes and then explode the forest, making way for new real estate for expanding his business.|$|E
5|$|Half {{the film}} was {{scheduled}} to shoot on five sound stages at Los Angeles: Downey, Sony, Warner Bros., Paramount and Universal. Filming moved to Chandler Field in Fresno, California, substituting for Mexico City International Airport, on October 11, 2007. After shooting aerial shots of Chandler Airport and a DC-3 {{on the morning of}} October 12, 2007, filming wrapped. Although he originally found no need for re-shoots after viewing his first cut of the film, Spielberg decided to <b>add</b> <b>an</b> establishing shot filmed on February 29, 2008, in Pasadena, California.|$|E

5|$|In 1977, ALDOT {{publicly}} {{unveiled the}} final routing {{of the route}} and presented it at a series of public meetings in August 1977. The selected route resulted in the slight relocation of 35th Street, {{the construction of a}} bridge along 31st Street over the freeway and the construction of a continuous viaduct along the final leg of the freeway through its 15th Street junction. Plans were also unveiled to <b>add</b> <b>an</b> additional travel lane in each direction along I-20/59 between its junction with I-359 and McFarland Boulevard.|$|E
5|$|South of Mill Point Road to Roe Highway {{the freeway}} has three lanes in each direction, without any bus lanes except for bus-only ramps at the Canning Bridge interchange. At the Roe Highway interchange, an extra {{southbound}} lane is added, providing four lanes southbound and two lanes northbound, until the Armadale Road/Beeliar Drive interchange in Cockburn, where the freeway {{is reduced to}} two lanes in each direction until Pinjarra Road. Works are currently underway to <b>add</b> <b>an</b> extra lane southbound between Armadale Road/Beeliar Drive, and Russell Road in Hammond Park. The median strip of the freeway north of The Spectacles also houses the Mandurah railway line. A shared pedestrian and bicycle path is built alongside the freeway.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} energy needed to remove or <b>add</b> <b>an</b> {{electron}}—the electron binding energy—is {{far less than the}} binding energy of nucleons. For example, it requires only 13.6eV to strip a ground-state electron from a hydrogen atom, compared to 2.23million eV for splitting a deuterium nucleus. Atoms are electrically neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Atoms that have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called ions. Electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms. By this mechanism, atoms are able to bond into molecules and other types of chemical compounds like ionic and covalent network crystals.|$|E

5|$|The only {{significant}} alteration {{to the structure}} of the bridge itself since the addition of the sculptures in 1907 came in 1973, when the Greater London Council (GLC) decided to <b>add</b> <b>an</b> extra traffic lane by reducing the width of the pavements. To counter the increased load of extra traffic, the council announced the replacement of the cast-iron balustrades with low box-girder structures. Despite formal objections from both Lambeth and Westminster Councils, the GLC ignored the objections. In 2015, the extra lane of motor traffic was removed in favour of a kerb-protected two-way cycle track, on the north-east side of the bridge. This forms part of Cycle Superhighway 5.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} {{approved}} in 1934, {{under the supervision}} of CORF (Commission d'Organisation des Régions Fortifiées), the Maginot Line's design and construction agency. Work by the contractor Chanel of Antibes began in 1935 at a cost of 14.5 million francs. A second phase was planned to <b>add</b> <b>an</b> artillery block. This was scaled back to a pair of separate artillery casemates. A separate entrance block was proposed in April 1940, linking to the casemates. As the initial confrontation with Germany was already underway, {{it was too late to}} be built, with a projected construction time of 18 months.|$|E
5|$|Fleming's golf partner, John Blackwell, (a {{cousin to}} Blanche Blackwell) {{was also a}} cousin by {{marriage}} to Ernő Goldfinger and disliked him: it was Blackwell who reminded Fleming of the name. Fleming also disliked what Goldfinger was doing destroying Victorian buildings, replacing them with the architect's modernist designs, particularly a terrace at Goldfinger's own residence at 2 Willow Road. Goldfinger threatened to sue Fleming {{over the use of}} the name and, in retaliation, Fleming threatened to <b>add</b> <b>an</b> erratum slip to the book changing the name from Goldfinger to Goldprick and explaining why; the matter was settled out of court after the publishers, Jonathan Cape, agreed to ensure the name Auric was always used in conjunction with Goldfinger. Fleming's golfing friend John Blackwell then became the heroin smuggler {{at the beginning of the}} book, with a sister who was a heroin addict.|$|E

5|$|Moving {{up to the}} {{national}} junior team, Getzlaf made his first of two appearances at the World Junior Hockey Championship in 2004. He recorded six points in six games for a Canadian squad that scored 25 goals in its four round-robin games and surrendered only four {{en route to a}} gold medal showdown with the United States. With Canada leading 3–1 early in the third period of the final, both Getzlaf and Sidney Crosby failed to capitalize on opportunities to <b>add</b> <b>an</b> extra goal that may have sealed a victory. Instead, Canada surrendered the lead, and Getzlaf and his teammates were forced to settle for the silver medal after goaltender Marc-André Fleury accidentally sent a clearing pass off a teammate and into his own net for the game-winning goal.|$|E
5|$|Nebula Award nominees and {{winners are}} chosen {{by members of}} SFWA, though {{the authors of the}} nominees {{do not need to be}} members. Works are {{nominated}} each year between November 15 and February 15 by published authors who are members of the organization, and the six works that receive the most nominations then form the final ballot, with additional nominees possible in the case of ties. Members may then vote on the ballot throughout March, and the final results are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony in May. Authors are not permitted to nominate their own works, and ties in the final vote are broken, if possible, by the number of nominations the works received. The rules were changed to their current format in 2009. Previously, the eligibility period for nominations was defined as one year after the publication date of the work, which allowed the possibility for works to be nominated in the calendar year after their publication and then be awarded in the calendar year after that. Works were added to a preliminary list for the year if they had ten or more nominations, which were then voted on to create a final ballot, to which the SFWA organizing panel was also allowed to <b>add</b> <b>an</b> additional work.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November 1898, the CCE {{published}} another bill to <b>add</b> <b>an</b> {{extension and}} to modify {{part of the}} route. The extension was a branch from Camden Town to Kentish Town where a new terminus was planned as an interchange with the Midland Railway's Kentish Town station. Beyond the terminus, the CCE line was {{to come to the}} surface for a depot on vacant land to the east of Highgate Road (occupied today by the Ingestre Road Estate). The modification changed the Euston branch by extending it northwards from Euston to connect to the main route {{at the south end of}} Camden High Street. The section of the main route between the two ends of the loop was omitted. Included in the bill were powers to purchase a site in Cranbourn Street for an additional station (Leicester Square). It received royal assent as the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway Act, 1899 on 9 August 1899.|$|E
