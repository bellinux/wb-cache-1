5|$|During the Gallipoli Campaign four {{light horse}} brigades had been {{dismounted}} and fought alongside the infantry divisions. However, in March 1916 the ANZAC Mounted Division {{was formed in}} Egypt (so named because it contained one mounted brigade from New Zealand). Likewise, the Australian Mounted Division—formed in February 1917—was originally named the Imperial Mounted Division because it contained the British 5th and 6th Mounted Brigades. Each division consisted of three mounted light horse brigades, each of which consisted of three regiments. Following {{the expansion of the}} Desert Column in August 1917 these divisions formed part of the Desert Mounted Corps, which consisted of the ANZAC Mounted Division, Australian Mounted Division and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade (which included a number of Australian, British and New Zealand camel companies). The AIF also included the Australian Flying Corps (AFC), which consisted of four operational squadrons—Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4, and four training squadrons—Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8. More than 2,000 women served with the AIF, mainly in the Australian Army Nursing Service. In addition, a number of other specialist units were <b>also</b> <b>raised,</b> including tunnelling companies, motor transport units, railway, ordnance, workshops and service units, and hospitals and other specialist medical and dental units. One small armoured unit was <b>also</b> <b>raised.</b>|$|E
