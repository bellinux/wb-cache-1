5|$|After opening, {{a long-running}} feud between {{the hotel and}} Lord Wimbourne, a steel magnate who lived next door at Wimbourne House, lasted for years {{in a dispute over}} land. A number of locals were <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{building}} and the impact it would have on their health.|$|E
5|$|Although Maryland {{remained}} in the Union, secessionist sentiment {{and support for the}} Confederacy was widespread in that state. Colonel Jones therefore expected a violent reception in Baltimore. He was <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> possibility of sabotage to the tracks on the way to Baltimore which might cause derailment and potentially large casualties for the 6th Massachusetts. Jones ordered that a pilot locomotive precede the train that transported his regiment. The 6th Massachusetts arrived safely in Baltimore about 10 a.m.|$|E
5|$|AI {{behavior}} in Halo Wars 2 drew some criticism. Some reviewers described the pathfinding of units as substandard, and others considered the enemy AI {{to be too}} easy and not very smart on the normal difficulty setting. IGN reviews editor Dan Stapleton disliked that bases had to placed in predetermined locations; he {{found it to be}} limiting and said it constrained build order freedom. Rock, Paper, Shotgun writer Fraser Brown was <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> restrictions on base building initially, however he became fond of the idea after playing the game for some time.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, the {{government}} approved a hydroelectric {{project in the}} park. This was controversial because the project would {{be carried out by}} a private company, and the resource is in a public park. There were <b>also</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> environmental impact.|$|R
5000|$|A UNICEF {{representative}} {{reported that}} the government is considering relocating [...] "one or two" [...] towns {{in the aftermath of the}} earthquake. There were <b>also</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Zika virus outbreak and the risk of dengue fever for people displaced by the quake.|$|R
5|$|The Americans {{were more}} open to negotiating. A rift {{developed}} {{between them and the}} British who, Bauer writes, were worried about large-scale Jewish immigration to Palestine, then under British control. There was <b>also</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> effect of Jewish immigration to the UK or US.|$|R
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1964, charges were printed in the April 16 issue of Close-Up, a celebrity tabloid, which claimed Aubrey was taking kickbacks from producers. The Federal Communications Commission made inquiries, and CBS learned that despite his $264,000 annual salary from the company, Aubrey's {{apartment}} on Manhattan's Central Park South was owned by Martin Ransohoff, the head of Filmways, the producer of the Hillbillies, Petticoat Junction, Mister Ed, and other CBS programs. And though he had a chauffeur-driven car {{paid for by the}} network, Brasselle's Richelieu Productions was paying for another chauffeured car for Aubrey, done so Paley and Stanton would not know what Aubrey was doing after hours. CBS had not known of either the apartment or the car. The company was <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> money spent to buy Gleason's former home.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 2000, {{with the}} {{discovery}} of at least three bodies (Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris) all comparable to Pluto in terms of size and orbit, it became clear that either they all had to be called planets or Pluto would have to be reclassified. Astronomers also knew that more objects as large as Pluto would be discovered, and the number of planets would start growing quickly. They were <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> classification of planets in other planetary systems. In 2006, the matter came to a head with the first measurement of the size of Eris. That measurement had showed Eris (as it was mistakenly believed to be until the New Horizons mission to Pluto) to appear to be slightly larger than Pluto, and so was thought to be equally deserving of the status of 'planet' at the time.|$|E
5|$|The Europeans were <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{long-term}} {{goals of the}} Mongols. Early Mongol diplomacy had been not a simple offer of cooperation, but straightforward demands for submission. It was only in later communications that Mongol diplomats started to adopt a more conciliatory tone; but they still used language that implied more command than entreaty. Even the Armenian historian Hayton of Corycus, the most enthusiastic advocate of Western-Mongol collaboration, freely admitted that the Mongol leadership was not inclined to listen to European advice. His recommendation was that even if working together, European armies and Mongol armies should avoid contact because of Mongol arrogance. European leaders were aware that the Mongols {{would not have been}} content to stop at the Holy Land, but were on a clear quest for world domination. If the Mongols had achieved a successful alliance with the West and destroyed the Mamluk Sultanate, they certainly would have eventually turned upon the Franks of Cyprus and the Byzantines. They also would have surely conquered Egypt, from which they could have continued an advance into Africa, where no strong state could have stood in their way until Morocco and the Islamic caliphates in the Maghreb.|$|E
50|$|The {{greatest}} {{structural design}} {{problem of the}} bridge itself is the aerodynamic stability of its deck under wind and seismic activity. There are <b>also</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> environmental impact of the bridge, its actual feasibility, and its resistance to earthquakes, common in this region.|$|R
5000|$|There were <b>also</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{increasing}} selectivity {{the bill}} would impose. A diploma would be delivered for student {{at the end of}} the first year, to make universities more competitive at a European level. Some said it would reduce the number of students.|$|R

5|$|The king sent St-Calais on {{diplomatic}} {{missions to}} the French royal court and to Rome. After the king's imprisonment of Odo of Bayeux, Pope Gregory VII complained to him. The pope was <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> king's refusal {{to allow the}} delivery of papal letters to the English bishops unless royal permission was secured. To placate the pope, the king dispatched St-Calais to Rome, possibly with Lanfranc, {{to explain to the}} pope the reasons for imprisoning Odo. St-Calais also served as a commissioner in the south-western part of England for the Domesday Book, which aimed to survey the whole of England and record who owned the lands. Some historians, including David Bates, have argued that St-Calais was {{the driving force behind the}} organization of the entire Domesday survey, although other candidates have been put forward, including Samson, Bishop of Worcester, before he became bishop. Pierre Chaplais, who argues for St-Calais being the main organizer of the survey, argues the bishop's exile in 1088 interrupted work on the Little Domesday Book, a subproject of the survey which was left uncompleted.|$|E
5|$|With the Mirage2000 and F-18L rejected, the RAAF {{was faced}} with a choice between the F-16 and F-18A. Richardson and several other RAAF pilots tested United States Air Force (USAF) F-16Bs in 1979 and 1980, and {{reported}} that the aircraft had excellent performance but could be difficult to control at times. The evaluation team was <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> reliability of the F-16's engine and regarded the aircraft as technologically immature. It was also noted that the aircraft's radar was inferior to that of the F-18A, and that F-16s could not fire the beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missiles and long-range anti-shipping missiles that the F-18A was capable of operating. In contrast, the evaluation team was impressed by the F-18A, and regarded it as being a more robust and survivable aircraft as it had been designed to operate from aircraft carriers; these features were important for operations from bare bases in northern Australia. Richardson and three other RAAF pilots test-flew F-18As, and reported that the aircraft handled well, but had some deficiencies with its flight control system and engines; these were not seen as major flaws by the evaluation team, however. The F-18A's twin engines were considered to be its main advantage over the single-engined F-16, as research conducted by the evaluation team found that the attrition rate for single-engined fighters was twice that for aircraft with two engines. Overall, however, the RAAF judged that both the F-16 and F-18A were too immature for a decision to be made in 1980 as had been originally planned, and recommended to the Government that this be deferred by a year.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the project}} has {{received}} mainly positive reviews from people living near the site, due to job creation and greater food security, there are minor concerns over the change in local scenery {{and the loss of}} traditional farming practices. There are <b>also</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> use of hydroponics producing less flavoursome produce.|$|R
5000|$|There are <b>also</b> <b>{{concerns}}</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> steer tailing event, due {{to concerns}} that a steer can suffer injuries to his tail, {{but also his}} back and limbs as he rolls. [...] Legislation to ban steer tailing, which also is an event seen in some rodeos, was introduced {{in at least two}} states.|$|R

25|$|Wald was <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{treatment}} of African Americans. As {{a civil rights}} activist, she insisted that all Henry Street classes be racially integrated. In 1909, she became {{a founding member of}} the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The organization's first major public conference opened at the Henry Street Settlement.|$|E
25|$|Following from this, Orzack {{continued}} her {{research in this}} area and contacting other academics in this field. Reactions towards her beliefs were mixed, as some stating she was crazy, yet other scientists were <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> issue. She compared computer addiction to other forms of addiction, such as gambling and alcohol addiction, and eating disorders.|$|E
50|$|This vastly {{increased}} {{volume of}} traffic caused the company to extend considerably the wharf facilities at Moorswater. There were <b>also</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> adequacy of the water supply with {{the increased use of}} the locks, and there was considerable friction between the company and millers higher up the East Looe Valley over use of water.|$|R
5000|$|According to Irene Aldridge, {{there is}} <b>also</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> reduced return on {{investment}} for individuals, the higher spreads and volatility in the market, and possible increased banking fees, which {{will need to be}} increased in order for banks to cover the higher risk associated with holding stocks, all of which will have detrimental effects on the [...] "main street".|$|R

25|$|Due to {{the stress}} and {{overwhelming}} amount of thinking involved in running a post-rebellion empire, the Yongle Emperor searched for scholars to serve in his government. He had {{many of the best}} scholars chosen as candidates and took great care in choosing them, even creating terms by which he hired people. He was <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> degeneration of Buddhism in China.|$|E
25|$|An {{article from}} the American Society of Agronomy {{refers to a}} study done by Monica Mendez et al., in which the {{researchers}} irrigated plants with water contaminated with triclosan and months later found it in all edible parts of tomato and onion plants. Triclosan is found to kill {{a wide spectrum of}} bacteria, and the researchers are <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> effect it has on the beneficial bacteria in soil.|$|E
25|$|Mr Pilkington – The easy-going but crafty and well-to-do {{owner of}} Foxwood, a large {{neighbouring}} farm overgrown with weeds. Unlike Frederick, Pilkington is wealthier and owns more land, but his farm {{is in need}} of care as opposed to Frederick's smaller but more efficiently-run farm. Although on bad terms with Frederick, Pilkington is <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> animal revolution that deposed Jones, and worried that this could also happen to him.|$|E
40|$|An {{exhibition}} of digital and embroidered images of extinct and vulnerable plants and animals, from across Far North Queensland. This exhibition titled Red Listed aims to encourage reflection <b>about</b> <b>the</b> loss {{of plant and}} animal species in the tropics and on a global level. There is <b>also</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> number and type of animals which are vulnerable.

25|$|The EU Regulation {{falls short}} {{of the needs of}} some {{consumers}} who need to use the old-style light bulbs for health-related reasons such as light sensitivity. We call on the European Commission to take immediate measures to ensure that people who rely on incandescent light bulbs will be able to buy these bulbs until suitable alternative lighting technologies are available. There are <b>also</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> risks to health from the high mercury content of the new bulbs.|$|R
25|$|Members of {{parliament}} were <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> timing. Some expressed disgust at {{the timing of}} the bill just before the centenary of the Gallipoli landing, some said the process was rushed, and Louisa Wall said that no significant event had occurred to warrant a flag change at this time. Nándor Tánczos noted a common perception that removing a symbol of British sovereignty from the flag before constitutionally removing British sovereignty is tokenistic.|$|E
25|$|Although Ireland {{was officially}} neutral, after the German Blitzkriegs of 1939–40 that {{resulted}} in the defeat of Poland, the Low Countries and France, the British recognised that Germany planned an invasion of Britain (Operation Sea Lion) and were <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> possibility of a German invasion of Ireland. German planning for Operation Green began in May 1940 and the British began intercepting communications about it in June. The British were interested in securing Ireland, as its capture by German forces would expose their western flank and provide a base of operations for the Luftwaffe in the Battle of the Atlantic and in any operations launched to invade Great Britain as part of Operation Sea Lion.|$|E
25|$|Like Christian IV before him, Gustavus Adolphus came {{to aid the}} German Lutherans, to {{forestall}} Catholic suzerainty in his back yard, and to obtain economic influence in the German states around the Baltic Sea. He was <b>also</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> growing power of the Holy Roman Empire, and like Christian IV before him, was heavily subsidized by Cardinal Richelieu, the chief minister of Louis XIII of France, and by the Dutch. From 1630 to 1634, Swedish-led armies drove the Catholic forces back, regaining much of the lost Protestant territory. During his campaign, he managed to conquer half of the imperial kingdoms, making Sweden the continental leader of Protestantism until the Swedish Empire ended in 1721.|$|E
