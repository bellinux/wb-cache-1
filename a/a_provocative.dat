5|$|Barça's local rival {{has always}} been Espanyol. Blanc-i-blaus, {{being one of the}} clubs granted royal patronage, was founded {{exclusively}} by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça's primary board. The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners. The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as <b>a</b> <b>provocative</b> representative of Madrid. Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià.|$|E
5|$|Cheng Yan Yan Wendy (born Cheng Yan Yan; 28 April 1984), {{better known}} by her {{pseudonym}} Xiaxue, is a Singaporean blogger and online television personality who writes about her life, fashion and local issues in <b>a</b> <b>provocative</b> style. Her main blog, which attracts about 50,000 readers daily, has won prestigious blog awards and earned her sponsorship deals, {{as well as}} stints as a columnist and TV show host, but some of her posts have sparked national controversies. She is married to American engineer Mike Sayre and they have one child.|$|E
5|$|Tightrope (1984) had Eastwood {{starring}} opposite Geneviève Bujold in <b>a</b> <b>provocative</b> thriller, {{inspired by}} newspaper articles about an elusive Bay Area rapist. Set in New Orleans to avoid confusion with the Dirty Harry films, Eastwood played a divorced cop drawn into his target's tortured psychology and fascination for sadomasochism. Tightrope {{was a critical}} and commercial hit and became the fourth highest-grossing R-rated film of 1984. Eastwood next starred in the crime comedy City Heat (1984) alongside Burt Reynolds, a film about a private eye and his partner who get mixed up with gangsters in the prohibition era of the 1930s. The film grossed around $50million domestically, but was overshadowed by Eddie Murphy's Beverly Hills Cop.|$|E

5|$|Although some {{of these}} {{restrictions}} were later loosened or rescinded, Johnson (with McNamara's support) kept a tight rein on the campaign, which continuously infuriated the American military commanders, right-wing members of Congress, and even some within the administration itself. One of the primary objectives of the operation, {{at least to the}} military, should have been the closure of Haiphong and other ports by aerial mining, thereby slowing or halting the flow of seaborne supplies entering the north. President Johnson refused to take such <b>a</b> <b>provocative</b> action, however, and such an operation was not implemented until 1972. There was also little consultation between Johnson and the military chiefs during the target selection process. Even the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Earl G. Wheeler, was not present for most of the critical discussions of 1965 and participated only occasionally thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The Theses {{are written}} as propositions to be argued {{in a formal}} {{academic}} disputation, {{though there is no}} evidence that such an event ever took place. In the heading of the Theses, Luther invited interested scholars from other cities to participate. Holding such a debate was a privilege Luther held as a doctor, and it was not an unusual form of academic inquiry. Luther prepared twenty sets of theses for disputation at Wittenberg between 1516 and 1521. Andreas Karlstadt had written a set of such theses in April 1517, and these were more radical in theological terms than Luther's. He posted them on the door of All Saints' Church, as Luther was alleged to have done with the Ninety-five Theses. Karlstadt posted his theses at a time when the relics of the church were placed on display, and this may have been considered <b>a</b> <b>provocative</b> gesture. Similarly, Luther posted the Ninety-five Theses on the eve of All Saints' Day, the most important day of the year for the display of relics at All Saints' Church.|$|E
5|$|Willkie {{enrolled}} at Indiana School of Law in late 1915. He {{was a top}} student, and graduated with high honors in 1916. At the commencement ceremony, with {{the state supreme court}} present, he gave <b>a</b> <b>provocative</b> speech criticizing his school. The faculty withheld his degree, but granted it after two days of intense debate. Willkie joined his parents' law firm, but volunteered for the United States Army on April 2, 1917, the day President Woodrow Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war against Germany. An army clerk transposed his first two names; with Willkie unwilling to invest the time to have the bureaucracy correct it, he kept his name as Wendell Lewis Willkie. Commissioned as a first lieutenant, Willkie was sent for artillery training, meaning he did not embark for France until September 1918. In January of that year, he married Edith Wilk, a librarian from Rushville, Indiana; the couple had one son, Philip. The war ended before Willkie reached the front, and he spent his time defending soldiers who had slipped away for time in Paris against orders. He was recommended for promotion to captain, but was discharged in early 1919 before the paperwork went through.|$|E

40|$|One {{hundred and}} {{nineteen}} eyes from 68 patients with open-angle glaucoma were provoked {{by means of}} <b>a</b> pilocarpine phenylephrine <b>provocative</b> test. In 22 % the response {{was the same as}} that seen in normal eyes. In 78 % the response was the same as that seen in contralateral eyes at risk to the development of closed-angle glaucoma, which do not develop <b>a</b> positive <b>provocative</b> test. The 68 patients were randomised and 34 submitted to <b>a</b> "dummy" <b>provocative</b> test. No significant change in pressure or outflow occurred. Fifty-two of the 93 eyes with <b>an</b> abnormal <b>provocative</b> test were selected for a peripheral iridectomy and reprovoked at least 6 months after operation. The results were significantly different from those obtained before operation. It was concluded that partial-angle closure could be demonstrated in some eyes with apparent open-angle glaucoma. The mechanisms involved in the production of partial-angle closure in eyes with apparent open-angle glaucoma are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Fifty-eight {{eyes from}} 58 {{patients}} {{in which there}} was no evidence of glaucoma were provoked with pilocarpine and phenylephrine drops. The result was a significant reduction in intraocular pressure and a significant increase in outflow facility. The 58 eyes were randomised and 19 submitted to <b>a</b> 'dummy' <b>provocative</b> test. There was no significant change in either pressure or outflow facility. The effect of the pilocarpine/phenylephrine provocative test in normal eyes is to produce a response that is the opposite of <b>a</b> positive <b>provocative</b> test in eyes at risk of developing closed-angle glaucoma...|$|R

25|$|The early {{gay rights}} movement, {{then called the}} Homophile Movement, was {{developed}} by the Mattachine Society, formed in 1950. Although the Mattachine Society began as <b>a</b> <b>provocative</b> organization with roots in its founders' communist activism, leadership of the Mattachine thought it more prudent and productive to convince heterosexual society at large that gays were not different from themselves, rather than agitate for change. They changed their tactics in 1953. The Daughters of Bilitis followed this model by encouraging its members to assimilate as much as possible into the prevailing heterosexual culture.|$|E

The book was made into the children movie Kidnapping on Palank Street (Gyerekrablás a Palánk utcában) in 1986. Nogradi wrote the script to the movie.|$|E
25|$|By {{the age of}} 16, Shields {{had become}} one of the most {{recognizable}} faces in the United States, because of her dual career as <b>a</b> <b>provocative</b> fashion model and child actress. Time magazine reported in its February 9, 1981 cover story that her day rate as a model was $10,000. In 1983, Shields appeared on the cover of the September issue of Paris Vogue, the October and November issues of American Vogue and the December edition of Italian Vogue. During that period Shields became a regular at New York City's nightclub Studio 54. In 2009, a picture of a naked Brooke Shields taken when she was 10 and included in a work by Richard Prince, Spiritual America, created a row. It was removed from an exhibition at the Tate Modern after a warning from the police.|$|E
