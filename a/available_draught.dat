50|$|The wharf at Kollam Port is 177 m {{in length}} and 12 m wide with an <b>available</b> <b>draught</b> of 6.5 m, whereby vessels up to 15,000 DWT can berth directly. Dredging works are {{underway}} at the port to increase the draught to 10 m {{at a cost of}} Rs.5.7 crores so that ships of 170 m and above can easily anchor without the need to travel further to Kochi, Thoothukudi or Chennai. The wharf is protected from the waves by a 2100 m seaboard breakwater and a 500 m leeward breakwater. The length of the wharf will be increased to 200 m in due course.

Reports also the Joint Vertisol Management Project, emphasizing the on-farm research and on-farm technology verification activities. The project includes three international research institutions: International Livestock Centre for Africa, the International Crops Research Centre for the Semi-Arid Tropics and the International Board on Soil Research and Management, and five national institutions: the Institute of Agricultural Research, the Ministry of Agriculture, Addis Ababa University, Alemaya University of Agriculture and the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission. The main functions of the Joint Vertisol Management Project are to link the cooperating institutions, to promote interdisciplinary research, to bridge existing gaps between research, extension and farmers, and to support project activities through external funding, training and communication...|$|E
