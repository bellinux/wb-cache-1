30|$|Starch {{is one of}} {{the most}} abundantly {{distributed}} polysaccharides produced by plants. It is made up of two molecular weight polymers, amylose and amylopectin. Amylose is a linear chain of glucose residues linked by α- 1, 4 bonds while amylopectin is a branched polymer with α- 1, 4 -linked and α- 1, 6 -linked glucose residues. AMG serves as a raw material for fermentation in the production of ethanol, glucose syrups, and in some cases can be used to improve barley mash for beer production (Aiyer 2005; Zambare 2010). Consequently, AMG can be considered as an economically significant enzyme because of its effectiveness in hydrolyzing starch and some oligosaccharides into β-d-glucose. Glucoamylase has been reported in Rhizopus oryzae (Morita and Fujio, 2000), Aspergillus awamori (Negi and Banerjee 2009), Aspergillus niger (Slivinski et al. 2011), as well as in two ectomycorrhizal fungi, Tricholoma matsutake and Lyophyllum shimeji (Hur et al. 2001; Kusuda et al. 2004). Kusuda et al. 2004 characterized an extracellular glucoamylase from L. shimeji, stating that the enzyme was most <b>active</b> <b>at</b> <b>around</b> 40  °C.

40|$|AbstractNorthern Sweden is {{currently}} experiencing active exploration within a new gold ore province, {{the so called}} Gold Line, situated southwest of the well-known Skellefte VMS District. The largest known deposit in the Gold Line is the hypozonal Fäboliden orogenic gold deposit. Mineralization at Fäboliden is hosted by arsenopyrite-rich quartz veins, in a reverse, mainly dip-slip, high-angle shear zone, in amphibolite facies supracrustal host rocks. The timing of mineralization is estimated, from field relationships, at ca. 1. 8 Ga. The gold mineralization is hosted by two sets of mineralized quartz veins, one steep fault–fill vein set and one relatively flat-lying extensional vein set. Ore shoots occur at the intersections between the two vein sets, and both sets could have been generated from the same stress field, during the late stages of the Svecofennian orogen. The tectonic evolution during the 1. 9 – 1. 8 Ga Svecofennian orogen is complex, as features typical of {{both internal and external}} orogens are indicated. The similarity in geodynamic setting between the contemporary Svecofennian and Trans-Hudson orogens indicates a potential for world-class orogenic gold provinces also in the Svecofennian domain. The Swedish deposits discussed in this paper are all structurally associated with roughly N–S striking shear zones that were <b>active</b> <b>at</b> <b>around</b> 1. 8 Ga, when gold-bearing fluids infiltrated structures related to conditions of E–W shortening...|$|E
40|$|M. A. South African {{teenagers}} name HIV/AIDS {{as the top}} concern facing them. Despite this, a {{large majority}} of them believe that they personally are at very low, or no risk for infection (loveLife, 2001). Furthermore, the onset of sexual activity has become progressively earlier, with many teenagers becoming sexually <b>active</b> <b>at</b> <b>around</b> 13 - 14 years old (Stadler & Hlongwa, 2002). 50 % of young people are sexually active by the age of 16 (Eaton, Flisher, & Aaro, 2002). However, only 30 % of sexually experienced youth report using a condom every time they have sexual intercourse. Sexually experienced teenagers report that they are most likely to get condoms from clinics, but only 32 % have been to a clinic in the past year for sexual health advice or care (loveLife, 2001). In the light of the alarming statistics mentioned above, youth represent an important target group for interventions, particularly those which address and effect changes in attitudes and behavior relating to sexuality. As a large number of children and teenagers attend school, information, skills, as well as values relayed in schools, can therefore have a considerable impact on their lives. Education systems should thoroughly educate children about HIV/AIDS infection, transmission and means of prevention, whilst assisting them to develop the life skills to apply their knowledge and communicate it to others. Programmes should assist in teaching children how to maintain health-enhancing behaviour and change, or avoid health-reducing behaviour (WHO, 1992) ...|$|E

40|$|Growth rate as a {{function}} of growth temperature has been studied for MOVPE InN. In the temperature range of 500 - 600 ℃, growth rate is increased with increasing growth temperature while TMI supply is constant, and shows a saturation against the increase in TMI supply. At 650 ℃, on the other band, such a saturation is not seen for TMI supply up to 28 μmol/min. As a result of this, a growth rate as high as 0. 8 μm/h is obtained at 650 ℃. Activation energy (~ 0. 76 eV) for saturated growth rate is in good agreement with that (0. 79 eV) reported for the thermal decomposition of NH_ 3 showing that the growth-rate is dominated by the active nitrogen supply and its saturation is due to the deficiency of <b>active</b> nitrogen. <b>At</b> <b>around</b> 650 ℃, growth rate is lower than that expected from the values at lower temperatures.

40|$|Active {{faulting}} {{in southern}} Tibet consists of N–S trending extensional faults and linked strike-slip faults, which are {{an expression of}} regional E–W extension. A second type of extensional deformation associated with N–S movement is also recognized. This extension is expressed {{as a series of}} shear zones and normal faults in the High Himalayas – the Southern Tibetan Detachment System – and mid-crustal rocks exposed in metamorphic domes. Reported constraints on the timing of movements associated with these two phases of extension indicate that N–S extension predates the onset of E–W extension. However, only a few studies have provided clear constraints on the timing of E–W extension {{and the extent to which}} the two kinematically distinct domains of extension were contemporaneous is unclear. The Kung Co fault in southern Tibet is a major N–S trending normal fault. The associated E–W extension is locally expressed as high-strain ductile deformation. Both field and microstructural observations show that this deformation occurred synchronously with granite intrusion. Previously reported U–Pb zircon dating shows granite crystallization took place at around 19 Ma, implying that ductile E–W extension in the Kung Co area was also <b>active</b> <b>at</b> <b>around</b> 19 Ma. This is the oldest documented example of E–W extension in Tibet and shows that E–W extension was at least locally contemporaneous with N–S extension to the south at shallower crustal levels. Simultaneous mid-crustal N–S extension and upper crustal E–W extension may be explained by southward flow of Tibetan crust with a divergent radial component...|$|E
40|$|Background. The HIV- 1 reverse {{transcriptase}} (RT) has two associated activities, DNA polymerase and RNase H, both essential for viral replication and validated drug targets. While all RT inhibitors approved for therapy target the DNA polymerase activity, {{there is the}} pressing need of new RT inhibitors possibly targeting the RNase H function and also active on RTs resistant to the known non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNRTI). Methods. The newly synthesized alizarine analogues were tested in biochemical and cellular assays and a docking study was performed to identify their binding pocket. Results. Several alizarine derivatives were synthesised and tested on both HIV- 1 {{reverse transcriptase}} (RT) -associated activities in biochemical assays. Alizarine analogue K 49 was the most potent derivative showing IC 50 values for both RT-associated functions around 10 µM, while derivative KNA 53 was <b>active</b> <b>at</b> <b>around</b> 20 µM. When tested on the K 103 N RT, K 49 and KNA 53 inhibited both RNase H and DNA polymerase functions, while when tested on the Y 181 C RT only KNA 53 {{was found to be}} active. Mechanism of action studies showed that these derivatives do not intercalate into DNA and do not chelate the divalent cofactor Mg 2 +. Kinetic studies demonstrated that they are non-competitive inhibitors and that they do not bind to the classical NNRTI binding site. Docking studies were also performed and confirmed these observations. Conclusions. Alizarine derivatives represents the proof of a new class of compounds which inhibits both RT-associated functions of wt and NNRTI mutant enzymes binding to a new RT pocket. ...|$|E

Even though a precise denition of turbulence does not exist, it is generally assumed that turbulence is a ow regime characterized by instabilities at large Reynolds numbers. The Reynolds number {{is a measure of the}} ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces. In the ocean, Reynolds number are of the order of 106, and so ocean dynamics is strongly nonlinear involving a large spectra of processes across all space and time scales. However, the ocean seems to be very <b>active</b> <b>at</b> <b>around</b> 30 - 300 Km, which is known as mesoscale. A schematic diagram of the spatial and temporal scales of various oceanic phenomena is shown in Figure 1. 1. Instabilities in the ocean explain the meandering nature of oceanic currents, which can isolate and shed eddies when the meanders reach large amplitudes [3]. Examples of such ows are high- and low-pressure systems that are formed in the Gulf Stream area (see Figure 1. 2). These systems have been related to coherent structures, which are a combination of the geometrical and dynamical properties of the ow, i. e., regions containing most of the surviving vorticity [56, 47]. As it occurs in the ocean, a turbulent ow self-organizes into a collection of coherent structures [91, 140]. The smaller eddies are exposed to the strain-rate eld of these coherent structures [123]. In recent studies, coherent structures not only have been identied with vortices, but also their presence has been connected with non-Gaussian Probability Density Functions (PDFs) of velocity elds from the ocean [17, 40, 54, 51, 139]. In addition to this characteristic, a near Gaussian component is expected for the background ow. This implies that the statistical distributions of ocean velocity elds have similar characteristics to the ones of bidimensional turbulencePeer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Two NADH {{dependent}} butanol(ethanol) dehydrogenases from Clostridium acetobutylicum {{have been}} purified to near homogeneity. Either {{of these two}} dehydrogenases {{could be part of}} the pathway for the production of butanola and are thus important for an understanding of the metabolism involved in butanol production. Another butanol dehydrogenase was detected that was largely dependent on NADPH. Studies were also carried out on the effects of rifampicin and chloramphenicol on the metabolism of C. acetobutylicum. Butanol dehydrogenases I and II are composed of two subunits of about 42 kD in weight, with a native molecular weight of 80 kD. Both enzymes were purified with Zn 2 + in the buffer to improve the recovery of enzyme activity. The enzymes were more <b>active</b> <b>at</b> <b>around</b> pH 6. 0, within the physiological pH range of 5. 6 - 6. 8 as reported for C. acetobutylicum. Both enzymes were substantially more active in the normal metabolic direction (butyraldehyde to butanol), and the kinetics of this reaction were studied in this direction. Both enzymes were determined to have ordered bi bi kinetic binding mechanisms. This mechanism was determined through substrate inhibition analysis with butyraldehyde for BDH I and through competitive and product inhibition studies for BDH II. The reactivity of the enzymes towards other substrates was also determined; the rate of the reduction of aldehydes appears to increase with increasing chain length for both butanol dehydrogenase I and II, none of the ketones studied acted as substrates. The most important difference is that BDH I was substantially more reactive towards acetaldehyde than BDH II. The effect of various metabolites, such as ATP and CoA, was also determined and the results were similar for each enzyme. The amino acid sequences and pI's were determined for both BDH I and II and slight differences were found. The effect of the addition of either rifampicin or chloramphenicol to growing cultures was studied for the products: butyrate, acetate, butanol, and acetone, and for the enzymes: phosphotransbutyrylase, butyrate kinase, coenzyme A transferase, butyraldehyde dehydrogenase, and butanol dehydrogenase (both NADH and NADPH dependent). The results demonstrated that phosphotransbutyrylase and butyrate kinase are constitutive and stable in vivo. CoA transferase and the butanol dehydrogenases were all induced/derepressed and were also stable in vivo. Butyraldehyde dehydrogenase was induced/derepressed but was highly unstable in vivo. The instability of butyraldehyde dehydrogenase coupled with the location of butyraldehyde dehydrogenase as a branch point in the butanol pathway, suggests that butyraldehyde dehydrogenase is highly important in regulating the flow of butyryl-CoA and therefore in regulating the switch from butyrate to butanol production...|$|E
40|$|Neoproterozoic, Pan-African low-grade metavolcanic {{rocks and}} {{associated}} mafic and ultramafic rocks of ophiolitic origin {{have long been}} identified within the pre-Neoproterozoic Saharan Metacraton (SMC). These low-grade rocks within generally high-grade (upper amphibolite facies) gneiss and schist {{have not yet been}} fully investigated, and their geological and geotectonic significance have been recognised only in a very few localities: (1) the Delgo–Atmur ophiolite and low-grade volcano-sedimentary belt, (2) the Rahib ophiolite and low-grade sedimentary fold and thrust belt, both in northern Sudan along the eastern boundary of the Saharan Metacraton and (3) the low-grade volcano-sedimentary rocks in the Central African Republic. Dismembered and low-grade metamorphosed occurrences of mafic extrusive and intrusive and minor ultramafic rocks, grouped as the Arid unit, {{similar to those of the}} Arabian Nubian Shield (ANS), are reported here for the first time in the westernmost part of the Nuba Mountains, southeastern Sudan. These occurrences are interpreted to represent part of an ophiolite sequence with a lower cumulate layer composed of layered gabbro and minor cumulate hornblendite and a top layer of thick massive gabbro, pillowed basalt and basaltic andesite. The Arid unit is structurally underlain by basaltic-andesite and andesite and a metasedimentary sequence identified as turbidite and both grouped as the Abutulu unit. All of the rocks are slightly sheared, deformed and metamorphosed under low-grade greenschist facies to epidote amphibolite sub-facies. New geochemical and Sr–Nd isotope data reveal that the low-grade metavolcanic rocks of the westernmost Nuba Mountains represent a Neoproterozoic oceanic arc/backarc assemblage. The massive gabbro and pillowed basalt of the Arid unit show the geochemical characteristics of HFSE-depleted tholeiitic basalt while the co-genetic and more evolved meta-andesite of Abutulu unit show a calc-alkaline signature. Both units display a REE pattern characterized by LILE enrichment indicating formation in an arc/back-arc environment. This arc was <b>active</b> <b>at</b> <b>around</b> 778 ± 90 Ma (Sm– Nd 12 WR isochron) that is similar in age to the arc magmatism in the ANS. The close interval between the TDM Nd model age (average of 10 metavolcanic samples is 814 Ma) and the crystallization age (778 ± 90 Ma) is indicative of little or no involvement of older material. The western Nuba Mountains metavolcanic rocks have eNd values of + 5. 9 at 778 Ma (average of 12 samples) indicating a depleted mantle source similar to that of the ANS (published range from + 6. 5 to + 8. 4). The eNd values of the metavolcanic rocks are different from previously published ages of high-grade basement rocks that occupy the area west of the Kabus suture and east of Abutulu (+ 2. 2 and + 3. 5 for the Rashad and Abbassyia). It is proposed that the metavolcanic and associated plutonic mafic rocks represent a unique Neoproterozoic entity named the Abutulu terrane that developed in a marginal back-arc basin west of the medium-grade gneiss of the Nuba Mountains. If the Abutulu terrane is included as a part of the ANS, then the eastern boundary of the SMC is adjacent to the western edge of the ANS along the Abutulu suture. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|A new {{promising}} ore province, the Gold Line, {{southwest of}} the well- known Skellefte District, northern Sweden, is currently under exploration. This province hosts, so far, one operating mine, the Svartliden Au mine, and the recently closed Blaiken Zn-Pb-Au-Ag mine. The largest known gold deposit, the hypozonal Fäboliden orogenic gold deposit, in the area was recently granted mining permits. The deposit holds c. 54 Mt at 1. 2 g/t Au, with a planned production of 4. 6 Mt of ore/year. The mineralization at Fäboliden is commonly hosted in arsenopyrite-bearing quartz-veins, within a roughly N-S striking, steeply dipping shear zone in amphibolite facies volcano- sedimentary host rocks. The narrow belt of supracrustal rocks is surrounded by late- to post-orogenic Revsund granite. The gold is fine-grained (2 - 40 µm) and closely associated with arsenopyrite- löllingite and stibnite. Gold is found in fractures and as inclusions in the arsenopyrite-löllingite. Gold is also seen as free grains in the silicate matrix of the host rock. The hydrothermal mineral assemblage in the proximal alteration zone is diopside, calcic amphibole, biotite, and minor andalusite and tourmaline. This type of assemblage is commonly recognized in hypozonal orogenic gold deposits worldwide. The lateral extent of the proximal alteration zone is estimated to 30 - 50 meters, {{and there is a}} good agreement between diopside- amphibole-biotite alteration, quartz veining, and gold mineralization. The mineral assemblage in the distal alteration zone is characterised by the presence of Ca- and Fe-Mg amphiboles, hedenbergite, biotite, and quartz. The transition from the distal alteration into the regional metamorphic assemblage is diffuse, and the only discernable feature appears to be a gradual decrease of amphibole away from the mineralization. The ductile gold-hosting fabric progresses laterally across the Revsund granite contact and then disappears after a few meters inside the granite, suggesting that at least the final stages of mineralization syn- to postdate the emplacement of the c. 1. 81 - 1. 77 Ga Revsund granite. Relationships between garnet-biotite and graphite geothermometry, together with these field relationships, indicate that the late stages of mineralization at Fäboliden post-date regional peak-metamorphism in the area, which is estimated at c. 1. 80 Ga. The Fäboliden gold mineralization is hosted by a reverse, mainly dip-slip, high-angle shear zone with a relatively small horizontal shear movement. The mineralization constitutes two sets of mineralized quartz veins, one steep fault-fill vein system that is parallel to the regional foliation and one flat-lying extensional vein system. Both vein sets are suggested to have been generated from the same stress field, during E-W shortening at c. 1. 80 Ga. At least two types of ore shoot are present at Fäboliden, intersections between the fault-fill vein set and the extensional vein set and bends in the shear zone system both show elevated gold content, similar to many gold- quartz vein deposits globally. The fluids involved in the precipitation of gold at Fäboliden shows characteristics similar to other hypozonal orogenic gold deposits, such as a CO 2 -CH 4 -H 2 S fluid composition and pressure-temperature conditions of c. 4 kbar and 520 - 560 °C. Sulphur isotope data ranges between - 1. 5 and + 3. 6 ‰. Oxygen and hydrogen isotope data ranges between + 10. 6 and 13. 1 ‰, and - 120 to - 67 ‰, respectively. The hydrothermal fluids at Fäboliden are interpreted to have originate from a crustally contaminated magmatic source. The potential for future orogenic gold discovery in the Fennoscandian Shield is considered good. From this PhD study it is suggested that interesting targets, concerning exploration for orogenic gold in at least the Gold Line, would be areas associated with roughly N-S striking tectonic zones that were <b>active</b> <b>at</b> <b>around</b> 1. 80 Ga.

50|$|On May 20, 1990, Popper stole IDF uniform trousers, an Galil assault rifle, {{and five}} box {{magazines}} full of ammunition from his brother, an <b>active</b> duty soldier. <b>At</b> <b>around</b> 6:15 a.m., Popper spotted {{a group of}} Palestinian Arab workers from the Gaza Strip {{at a bus stop}} in Rishon Lezion, who were waiting to be picked up from their laboring jobs in Israel. Suspecting they were Arab, he demanded to see their identity cards, and after confirming they were Arabs he ordered them to line up in three rows, on their knees. Popper then opened fire with the Galil rifle, killing 7 Palestinians immediately and a further 10/11 were wounded badly, before leaving the scene in his car. Palestinian reports state that, on arriving at the scene, Israeli police proceeded to beat up the surviving victims. Within an hour, he was arrested.|$|R
40|$|The fauna of hoverflies in Boreal and Arctic {{parts of}} Scandinavia {{is still very}} poorly investigated. Therefore we {{performed}} an 11 year survey of the hoverfly genus Platycheirus Lepeletier & Serville, 1828 along the Caledonian mountain chain in Sweden (from Värmland northwards to the Torneträsk area). During 2003 - 2013 we annually performed two trips in order to survey various areas and to collect flies by netting. Altogether 150 localities were visited {{and a total of}} 1862 Platycheirus-specimens belonging to 40 species were collected. Two species were recorded {{for the first time in}} Sweden: Platycheirus carinatus(Curran, 1927) and P. magadanensis Mutin, 1999 and 74 records were new for various fauna-provinces. Four main areas were selected for comparative studies on distribution, habitat, local migration and environmental influences on population fluctuation of Platycheirus-species. We noted that males hatch earlier than females and the latter sex await the maturing anthers of their feeding plants. Moreover, Platycheirus-species in alpine and subalpine terrain seem to be very cold resistant and <b>active</b> <b>at</b> air-temperatures <b>around</b> 10 O C. Environmental disturbance within the subalpine and northern boreal vegetation zones, e. g. cutting of woods or constructing of slalom slopes, creates new flower rich habitats and therefore support the population sizes within this assemblage of overflies. The observed distribution of northern Platycheirus-species along the Boreal and Arctic parts of Scandinavia reflects its worldwide Holarctic and Palearctic relations...|$|R
5000|$|The {{attack was}} carried out by a three man <b>Active</b> Service Unit. <b>At</b> <b>around</b> 6.00pm two members of the unit opened fire in the bar with handguns before the third member of the unit ran in with the bomb, placed it were it would do most damage near the doorway, lit the fuse and then the unit ran out of the pub and drove away. The force of the {{explosion}} was massive and brought the roof crashing in on the customers. The bar was packed with people waiting to watch the Grand National horse race when the attack happened. The bar was known to be popular with Volunteers of the UVF. The getaway car used in the attack was found abandoned in the Springfield area: a stronghold for the PIRA. The five dead people were almost killed instantly and some of those injured had lost limbs. It took rescue services hours to free people from the rubble.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{electrochemical}} {{properties of}} â-type nickel (oxy) hydroxides Ni(OH) 2 and NiO(OH) {{are known to}} depend significantly on their structural features. In this work, these features are investigated by means of inelastic neutron scattering and infrared and Raman spectroscopies. Our experiments probe both inter- and intramolecular (40 - 4000 cm- 1) vibrational ranges and particular {{attention is paid to}} the low-frequency (40 - 300 cm- 1) domain, where new features are observed. Namely, the presence of an IR <b>active</b> mode <b>at</b> <b>around</b> 130 cm- 1, characteristic of the oxidized â-NiO(OH) phase, is observed for the first time. The effects of temperature (10 - 300 K) and deuteration are also measured in order to provide deeper insight into the nature of the vibrational states. A detailed comparison of all of the collected data allows us to propose a new assignment of the vibrational features observed in both â-Ni(OH) 2 and â-NiO(OH) and to quantify the proton dynamic relevance on the vibrational modes. We show that the interlayer interactions are mostly electrostatic and, hence, do not involve hydrogen bonding. We also point out that, in the oxidized â-phase, protons cannot be localized {{so that they can be}} considered as fully labile. To sum up, this investigation emphasizes that proton delocalization and crystalline disorder, which arise concomitantly upon oxidation, are the key factors that explain the evolution of the vibrational features observed between the oxidized and reduced â-type forms...|$|R
50|$|However, {{the case}} {{was the subject of}} intense {{international}} media attention because it shined a spotlight on the cloning issue and the emerging and enormously promising field of stem cell research. It was also the catalyst for Siegel to trade in his 30-year courtroom career to found the Genetics Policy Institute (now called the Regenerative Medicine Foundation). The Regenerative Medicine Foundation is now a world leader in supporting the global cause of stem cell research by promoting sound, ethical research within a framework of supportive public policy. The institute does this through public education initiatives, meetings among experts and activists, its comprehensive website and published information, and sponsorship of the Student Society for Stem Cell Research.
