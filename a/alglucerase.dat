5000|$|In 1991 the FDA {{approved}} {{the first version}} of Genzyme's orphan drug <b>Alglucerase</b> (brand name Ceredase), the only treatment for Gaucher's disease. At that time, according to Genzyme CEO Henri Termeer — a pioneer in the biotechnology industry business model — one treatment of Ceredase for one patient took 22,000 placentas annually to manufacture, a difficult and expensive procedure. [...] A new version of Ceredase, called Cerezyme, Imiglucerase which Genzyme produced in 1994 using genetically modified cells in vitro, was cheaper and easier to produce, was approved in several countries. In 2005 there were only about 4,500 patients on Cerezyme. In marketing imiglucerase, Termeer introduced the innovative and successful business strategy that became a model for the biotechnology or life sciences industry in general and specialty pharmacy in particular. Genzyme's added revenue from profits on the highly priced orphan or specialty drugs like imiglucerase, which had no competition, was used to undertake research and development for other drugs and to allow them to fund programs that distribute a small portion of production for free. In 2005 he then created what would eventually become a feature service of specialty pharmacy, by hiring 34 people to help patients acquire insurance plans that would cover the cost of their drugs. By 2005 although Cerezyme cost the average patient (including babies) $200,000 a year, it could cost a single adult patient as much as $520,000 a year even though it cost Genzyme less than $52,000 to manufacture, because the alternative is severe debilitation and early death.

40|$|Mannose-terminated {{glucocerebrosidase}} (alglucerase; Ceredase) {{was designed}} for enzyme replacement therapy in Gaucher disease {{to take advantage of}} mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis by macrophages. To provide a rational basis for designing enzyme replacement therapy protocols, we examined the in vitro binding, uptake, and degradation of <b>alglucerase</b> by murine and human macrophages. Both were found to have approximately 500, 000 mannose-dependent receptors for <b>alglucerase</b> per cell with a Kd of 10 (- 7) M at 0 degrees C. In contrast, the number of binding sites for mannose-bovine serum albumin (mannose-BSA), the classical ligand for the mannose receptor, was only approximately 20, 000 with a Kd of 10 (- 8) M. <b>Alglucerase</b> was also bound in a mannose-dependent manner by cells that lack the capacity to bind mannose-BSA, such as Cos- 1 cells, endothelial cells, and peripheral blood monocytes. The fact that the binding of <b>alglucerase</b> by macrophages was mediated principally by a receptor distinct from the classical mannose receptor that binds mannose-BSA was confirmed by differential inhibitors, viz., alpha-methyl-glucoside, fucose, and mannose-BSA, and by its independence on Ca 2 +. Uptake of <b>alglucerase</b> by macrophages at 37 degrees C was concentration dependent and half maximal at 10 (- 6) M. However, at a concentration of 10 (- 7) M, only 0. 5 % of the added <b>alglucerase</b> was incorporated into macrophages and approximately 50 % of the <b>alglucerase</b> taken up was quickly released into the medium. Endothelial cells also manifest mannose-dependent binding and uptake of <b>alglucerase</b> and may therefore account for {{a large proportion of the}} infused <b>alglucerase.</b> Our data suggest that only a small amount of the <b>alglucerase</b> administered is effectively delivered to macrophages and that a more efficiently targeted enzyme might have a marked therapeutic advantage over mannose-terminated glucocerebrosidase...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that enzyme supplementation therapy with <b>alglucerase</b> for type 1 Gaucher's disease is {{effective}} at doses of 30 - 130 U/kg per month. Since both the clinical presentation and the response to therapy in Gaucher's disease are highly variable, individual dosing seems indicated. This notion, as well as the high costs of <b>alglucerase</b> and the unknown long-term side-effects, led us to investigate the efficacy of an individualised very low dose of <b>alglucerase.</b> Twenty-five adults with symptomatic type 1 Gaucher's disease (thirteen splenectomised) received <b>alglucerase</b> 1. 15 U/kg three times a week (15 U/kg per month). Every 6 months, the dose was halved, maintained, or doubled, according to the response (based on haematological variables and liver and spleen volume). After 6 months of treatment, eighteen (72 %) patients had a response (seventeen moderate, one good). After 12 months (in nineteen patients) and 18 months (in seven patients), all had sustained improvement. Severe splenomegaly resulted in slower haematological responses. Our results are similar to those obtained by others with higher-dose regimens and better than a low-dose regimen of 10 U/kg every 2 weeks.

40|$|Gaucher's {{disease is}} an {{inherited}} lysosomal storage disorder that {{is caused by}} a deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. The resulting accumulation of the substrate glucosylceramide in macrophages of liver, spleen, and bone marrow causes severe clinical symptoms. Gaucher's disease is treated by intravenous administration of a modified glucocerebrosidase (<b>Alglucerase),</b> which has exposed mannose residues to promote uptake by target macrophages. To evaluate the effectiveness of the targeting of <b>Alglucerase,</b> we studied the fate of the enzyme in the rat. Intravenously injected <b>Alglucerase</b> was rapidly cleared from the circulation (half-life 2. 0 +/- 0. 5 min). The liver was the main site of uptake, with 65. 6 +/- 1. 2 % of the dose present at 10 min after injection. Smaller amounts (90 %. These findings indicate that the enzyme is taken up by these organs via mannose-specific receptors. Subcellular fractionation of the liver indicated that the enzyme is internalized and transported to the lysosomes. By isolating various liver cell types after injection of the <b>Alglucerase,</b> it was found that endothelial cells are the main site of uptake of the enzyme: 60. 8 +/- 3. 4 % of the total liver uptake. Parenchymal and Kupffer cells were responsible for 31. 0 +/- 3. 1 % and 8. 2 +/- 0. 7 % of the hepatic uptake, respectively. We conclude that <b>Alglucerase</b> is rapidly cleared from the circulation by mannose-specific receptors in liver, spleen, and bone marrow. However, less than 10 % of the enzyme taken up by the liver is accounted for by Kupffer cells, the hepatic target cells for therapeutic intervention. It is suggested that alterations of the formulation of the therapeutic enzyme may lead to a higher uptake by Kupffer cells and other macrophages, and thus to a more (cost) effective therapy of Gaucher's diseas...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Gaucher {{disease is}} a common {{glycolipid}} storage disease, caused by a deficiency of lysosomal beta-glucosidase (glucocerebrosidase). <b>Alglucerase</b> {{is a form of}} glucocerebrosidase enriched with terminal mannose moieties, so as to "target" the preparation to the high-affinity macrophage receptor in patients with Gaucher disease. Our earlier in vitro studies indicated that <b>alglucerase</b> was bound by cells other than macrophages by a widely distributed, low-affinity mannose receptor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone was removed at surgery from six patients with Gaucher disease; in three cases, bone was obtainable both when the patient was untreated and after receiving an infusion of <b>alglucerase.</b> Four samples of bone were obtained from patients without Gaucher disease and served as controls. A bone marrow aspirate was obtained from another patient with Gaucher disease immediately after enzyme infusion. Marrow beta-glucosidase activity and chitotriosidase (a macrophage marker) was determined on all samples. RESULTS: Even with the large bolus doses used for the treatment of Gaucher disease by some, scarcely any beta-glucosidase activity was found in marrow samples; the amount of the enzyme was much less than would have been anticipated had the enzyme been evenly distributed to all body cells. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Alglucerase</b> is not targeted to marrow macrophages. Its unquestioned therapeutic effectiveness must be due either to its activity at some site other than marrow macrophages or {{to the fact that the}} doses administered are so enormous that even a small fraction is sufficient to achieve a therapeutic effect...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In type 1 Gaucher disease (GD), the {{accumulation}} of glucocerebroside in macrophages, caused by deficient activity of glucocerebrosidase, results {{in a variety of}} disease manifestations. In addition to the characteristic features of hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia, and bone abnormalities, resting energy expenditure (REE) and glucose production are increased. In this study the effects of enzyme supplementation therapy on metabolic parameters in relation to other disease manifestations in type 1 GD patients are investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 12 adult type 1 GD patients, measurements of REE (by indirect calorimetry), liver and spleen volume (by spiral computerized axial tomography [CT]) and hemoglobin and platelet count were obtained before and after 6 months of <b>alglucerase</b> therapy (15 U/kg per month). In 7 of the 12 patients hepatic glucose production was measured by infusing 3 - 3 H glucose. For comparison, REE and glucose metabolism were studied in 7 weight- and age-matched healthy subjects. RESULTS: REE and glucose production were increased in GD patients as compared with controls (REE: 29. 8 kcal/kg/ 24 h +/- 3. 6 and 23. 1 +/- 2. 3 kcal/kg/ 24 h, respectively, P < 0. 05; glucose production: 14. 00 mumol/kg/min +/- 0. 51 and 10. 77 mumol/kg/min +/- 0. 26, respectively, P < 0. 03). There were no differences in plasma glucose concentrations. Whereas the elevated REE decreased after 6 months of <b>alglucerase</b> therapy from 129 % to 120 % of predicted values (P < 0. 01), the increase in hepatic glucose production did not change. An increase in weight occurred after 6 months of treatment (1. 7 +/- 0. 8 kg, P < 0. 001), which was accounted for by an increase in fat mass of 1. 6 +/- 1. 5 kg (P < 0. 02). Hemoglobin levels increased from 11. 2 mg/dL to 12. 1 mg/dL (P = 0. 05) and platelet counts rose from 84 x 10 (9) /L to 113 x 10 (9) /L (P < 0. 05). Although liver and spleen volumes decreased by approximately 10 % and approximately 20 %, respectively, there was no correlation between the decrease in organ volumes and the decrease in REE. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with <b>alglucerase</b> improves hypermetabolism and organomegaly in GD, whereas the increase in glucose production persists. Therefore, the dose-response effects of <b>alglucerase</b> are variable for the different manifestations of type 1 G...|$|E
40|$|Gaucher {{disease is}} caused by a {{deficiency}} of glucocerebrosidase. It is the first lysosomal storage disorder for which effective enzyme-supplementation therapy has become available. The enzyme, <b>alglucerase,</b> is glucocerebrosidase derived from human placental tissue; its oligosaccharide chain has been modified to expose terminal mannose residues, facilitating uptake in macrophages. Many patients have been shown to benefit from treatment with the enzyme. Spleen and liver volumes decrease and cytopenia improves. Over a longer period of time, bone involvement can also be diminished, although severe pre-existing bone abnormalities do not change. The safety profile of <b>alglucerase</b> seems excellent, with only few adverse events and approximately 12 % of patients developing antibodies. Because long term safety is unknown and the enzyme is very expensive, studies have focused on the determination of the optimum individual dosage. Different dosages have shown to be effective, but so far the identification of patients who need a high or a low dosage is unclear. Other issues that deserve attention are the selection criteria for the initiation of treatment and the place of prophylactic treatment. Diversity {{in the course of the}} disease, which in many cases cannot be predicted by genotyping, hampers the establishment of strict rules.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Enzyme {{replacement}} therapy (ERT) for Gaucher&#x 2032;s disease with <b>alglucerase</b> or imiglucerase is efficacious, well-tolerated and safe. However, cost considerations, visits to medical facilities, potentially duration of theray for life, are issues of major concern to {{a proportion of}} treated patients and has, in some cases, led to the withdrawal of therapy. AIMS: To elucidate whether {{an extension of the}} interval between enzyme infusions to once every three weeks is as effective in maintaining the clinical responses achieved with the bi-monthly regimen. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four patients with an optimal response to ERT (at 30 units/kg every two weeks for an average of 27 months), were subjected to enzyme dose/frequency changes that essentially constituted a reduction in cumulative dose over the treatment period. Patients were assessed every 6 months for alterations in haematological parameters, plasma chitotriosidase levels, liver and spleen size, and bone symptoms. RESULTS: All patients had to resume the previous infusion schedule of once every two weeks; one because of new bone marrow infiltrates, two because of visceral enlargement, and the fourth due to progressive anaemia. CONCLUSIONS: This limited experience suggests that a reduction in enzyme dose associated with an extended interval between infusions may lead to variable disease control, and underscores the need for individualization of enzyme therapy...|$|E
40|$|In tissue lesions of type I Gaucher patients, {{characteristic}} lipid-laden macrophages, 'Gaucher cells', {{are surrounded}} by inflammatory phagocytes. Gaucher cells secrete the elevated plasma chitotriosidase. The elevated plasma MIP- 1 beta in Gaucher patients stems from the phagocytes surrounding the Gaucher cells. Plasma chitotriosidase and MIP- 1 beta decrease upon successful enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with mannose-terminated recombinant glucocerebrosidase (<b>alglucerase).</b> Previous histochemical analysis of Gaucher spleens revealed that Gaucher cells express little mannose receptor, in contrast to surrounding phagocytes. We therefore investigated the corrective effects of ERT on plasma MIP- 1 beta and chitotriosidase in more detail. We also compared effects of one year of treatment with a relatively low dose and a relatively high dose of ERT. A more rapid correction in plasma MIP- 1 beta, compared to chitotriosidase, was observed in most patients on low-dose ERT. Correction of plasma MIP- 1 beta and chitotriosidase levels was more pronounced in the higher-dosed patient group. Upon prolonged treatment, differences in the effects of enzyme dose were no longer significant. Normalization of plasma MIP- 1 beta and chitotriosidase levels was attained {{in the majority of}} patients. In conclusion, ERT with mannose-terminated gluocerebrosidase results in prominent corrections of plasma chitotriosidase, a marker of Gaucher cells, and in particular of plasma MIP- 1 beta, a marker of inflammatory phagocytes. The sharper response in plasma MIP- 1 beta to ERT is in line with the observation that especially phagocytes surrounding Gaucher cells express mannose-receptor...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether enzyme therapy with imiglucerase/ <b>alglucerase</b> demonstrates dose-response relationships with doses and disease parameters used in routine clinical practice for Gaucher disease type 1 patients. Methods: Analyses included all patients with Gaucher disease type 1 on enzyme therapy and with intact spleens {{in the large}} observational database of the International Collaborative Gaucher Group Gaucher Registry. Propensity scoring was used to match patients between enzyme therapy (lose groups categorized as Group A (5 U to < 29 U/kg/ 2 weeks), Group B (29 U to < 48 U/kg/ 2 weeks), Group C (48 U to < 75 U/kg/ 2 weeks). Hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, and hepatic and splenic volumes were assessed after initiation of enzyme therapy using nonlinear mixed effects models. The maximal effect (E-max) and half-time to E-max (T- 50), of enzyme therapy for each parameter were compared across dosing groups. Results: Propensity score matching resulted in three comparable groups of 122 patients each (enzyme therapy in Groups A, B, and Q.

40|$|In type 1 Gaucher disease, {{decreased}} {{activity of}} glucocerebrosidase results in accumulation of glucosylceramide in macrophages. Infiltration of liver, spleen and bone marrow by lipid-laden macrophages leads to hepatosplenomegaly, bone lesions and cytopenia. These abnormal macrophages may produce and release macrophage derived factors and cytokines, which {{could contribute to}} the pathophysiology of the disease. Whether these cytokines and factors are elevated in Gaucher disease is currently unknown. In 29 type 1 Gaucher disease patients we measured serum levels of the macrophage derived cytokines IL 8, IL 6, TNFalpha, M-CSF and the monocyte/macrophage activation marker sCD 14. These factors were studied in relation to disease severity and during treatment with enzyme supplementation therapy. Most patients showed remarkably elevated levels of M-CSF (2 - 8 fold) and sCD 14 (2 - 5 fold) as compared to normal controls. Levels of IL 8 were elevated in all patients (2 - 20 fold), whereas levels of IL 6 and TNFalpha were normal. There was a significant correlation between severity of the disease {{as determined by the}} severity score index (SSI), and M-CSF, sCD 14 and IL 8 levels. M-CSF and sCD 14 levels also correlated with the excess liver and spleen volumes. During treatment with <b>alglucerase,</b> levels of M-CSF and sCD 14 declined, but IL 8 remained unchanged. The relative reduction in excess liver and spleen volume did not correlate with the relative reduction in M-CSF or sCD 14 levels.

40|$|Background: Gaucher disease (GD) type I is {{the most}} common type of GD. Its main {{clinical}} manifestations are hepatosplenomegaly as well as bone and hematological abnormalities. The objective of the present study was to perform a literature review on the growth and metabolism of GD type I patients. Methods: We searched Pubmed and Scielo. br databases with predetermined study limits: case series (n≥ 5), clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with <b>alglucerase</b> or imiglucerase. The outcomes of interest were the following: growth and development, weight, height, malnutrition, overweight, obesity, basal metabolism, hypermetabolism, insulin resistance, and diabetes. A total of 175 articles were found, of which 28 met the inclusion criteria; these articles were grouped into three central themes: 1) growth of children and adolescents before and after ERT; 2) metabolic changes that remained during ERT; and 3) changes in metabolic status resulting from the treatment. Results and discussion: The articles included in the present literature review are very heterogeneous, which hinders the analysis of data. They indicated that GD patients usually show low weight and height before ERT, which are improved with treatment in children and adolescents. Studies evaluating the energy metabolism by indirect calorimetry have indicated that the disease is associated with hypermetabolism. In adults, some changes in energy metabolism remain on ERT, and alterations, such as insulin resistance, seem to be associated with the treatment. It is not clear which are the required doses of imiglucerase for obtaining an adequate cost-effective relation, as well as the advisable therapeutic measures to avoid possible long-term adverse effects related to ERT. Conclusions: ERT tends to normalise the growth of children and adolescents with GD type I, it seems to cause a partial response in relation to some metabolic changes associated with the disease, and it can causes metabolic changes such as weight gain in adult patients. Therefore, additional research is necessary...|$|E
40|$|Background Gaucher disease, a rare disorder, {{is caused}} by {{inherited}} deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. It is unique among the ultraorphan disorders in that four treatments are currently approved by various regulatory authorities for use in routine clinical practice. Hitherto, because of the relatively few people affected worldwide, many of whom started therapy during a prolonged period when there were essentially no alternatives to imiglucerase, these treatments have not been systematically evaluated in studies such as randomized controlled trials now considered necessary to generate {{the highest level of}} clinical evidence. Objectives To summarize all available randomized controlled study data on the efficacy and safety of enzyme replacement therapies and substrate reduction therapy for treating Gaucher disease. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register. Additional searches were conducted on ClinicalTrials. gov for any ongoing studies with potential interim results, and through PubMed. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 07 August 2014. Selection criteria All randomized and quasi-randomized controlled studies (including open-label studies and cross-over studies) assessing enzyme replacement therapy or substrate reduction therapy, or both, in all types of Gaucher disease were included. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias in the included studies, and extracted relevant data. Main results Of the 488 studies retrieved by the electronic searches, eight met the inclusion criteria and were analysed (300 participants). Response parameters were restricted to haemoglobin concentration, platelet count, spleen and liver volume and serumbiomarkers (chitotriosidase and CCL 18). Only one publication reported a 'lowrisk of bias' score in all parameters assessed, and all studies included were randomized. Four studies reported the responses to enzyme replacement therapy of previously untreated individuals with type 1 Gaucher disease. Two studies investigated maintenance enzyme replacement therapy in people with stable type 1 Gaucher disease previously treated for at least two years. One study compared substrate reduction therapy, enzyme replacement therapy and a combination thereof as maintenance therapy in people with type 1 Gaucher disease previously treated with enzyme replacement therapy. One study examined substrate reduction therapy in people with chronic neuronopathic (type 3) Gaucher disease who continued to receive enzyme replacement therapy. Treatment-naive participants had similar increases in haemoglobin when comparing those receiving imiglucerase or <b>alglucerase</b> at 60 units/kg, imiglucerase or velaglucerase alfa at 60 U/kg, taliglucerase alfa at 30 units/kg or 60 units/kg, and velaglucerase alfa at 45 units/g or 60 units/kg. For platelet count response in participants with intact spleens, a benefit for imiglucerase over velaglucerase alfa at 60 units/kg was observed, mean difference - 79. 87 (95 % confidence interval - 137. 57 to - 22. 17). There were no other significant differences in platelet count response when comparing different doses of velaglucerase alfa and of taliglucerase alfa, and when comparing imiglucerase to <b>alglucerase.</b> Spleen and liver volume reductions were not significantly different in any enzyme replacement therapy product or dose comparison study. Although a dose effect on serum biomarkers was not seen after nine months, a significantly greater reduction with higher dose was reported after 12 months in the velaglucerase study, mean difference 16. 70 (95 % confidence intervaI 1. 51 to 31. 89). In the two enzyme replacement therapy maintenance studies comparing infusions every two weeks and every four weeks, {{there were no significant differences}} in haemoglobin concentration, platelet count, and spleen and liver volumes over a 6 to 12 month period when participants were treated with the same cumulative dose. A total of 25 serious adverse events were reported, nearly all deemed unrelated to treatment. There are, as yet, no randomized trials of substrate reduction therapy in treatment-naive patients that can be evaluated. Miglustat monotherapy appeared as effective as continued enzyme replacement therapy for maintenance of hematological, organ and biomarker responses in people with type 1 Gaucher disease previously treated with imiglucerase for at least two years. In those with neuronopathic Gaucher disease, no significant improvements in haemoglobin concentration, platelet count or organ volumes occurred when enzyme replacement therapy was augmented with miglustat. One randomized controlled study assessing substrate reduction therapy was published immediately prior to producing the final version of this review, and this, along with a further ongoing study (expected to be published in the near future), will be assessed for eligibility in a future update of the review. Authors' conclusions The results reflect the limitations of analysing evidence restricted to prospective randomized controlled trials, especially when dealing with chronic rare diseases. This analysis suggests that, during the first year of treatment, different recombinant glucocerebrosidases are bio-similar and non-inferior in safety and efficacy for surrogate biological response parameters. Enzyme replacement therapy given at 30 to 45 units/kg body weight every two to four weeks was generally as effective as the 60 unit/kg dose for the assessed clinical outcomes. The analysis emphasise the need to determine whether it is realistic to carry out multi-decade prospective clinical trials for rare diseases such as type 1 Gaucher disease. With large treatment effects on the classical manifestations of the disorder, therapeutic investigations in Gaucher disease mandate innovative trial designs and methodology to secure decisive data concerning long-term efficacy and safety with the realization that knowledge about disease-modifying actions that are sustained are of crucial importance to people with this chronic conditio...|$|E
