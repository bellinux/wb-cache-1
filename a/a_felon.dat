500|$|The Hudson Valley Rail Trail is a paved [...] east–west rail {{trail in}} the town of Lloyd in Ulster County, New York, {{stretching}} from the Hudson River through the hamlet of Highland.

By the 1980s the corridor's then-owner, Conrail, had routed all rail traffic in the region north through Selkirk, and was eager to relieve itself of the bridge and adjoining rights-of-way.
