5|$|Airport {{security}} was introduced on 1 January 2005. This put a large {{strain on the}} terminal capacity and the terminal had to be expanded. Makeshift solutions were used, such as plywood boards to allocate people through the security check. In late 2004, the airport started planning an all-new terminal building, as the old terminal was deemed both too small and out of date. Construction of the NOK-115-million terminal started on 24 October 2006. As the first airport in the world, Brønnøysund received SCAT-I, a satellite-based landing system, on 29 October 2007. The new terminal opened on 26 May 2008, which allowed the a restaurant to open at the airport, all vehicles to be stored indoors and included a new helicopter terminal.

Ground Clutter Processing for Wind Measurements with <b>Airport</b> <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Radars</b> Modern <b>airport</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radars</b> (ASR) are coherent pulsed-Doppler radars used for detecting and tracking aircraft in terminal area air-space. These radars might serve an additional role by making radial wind measurements in the immediate vicinity of an airport to provide data on low altitude wind shear (LAWS). One factor that will affect their capability in this role is the requirement that intense low-beam ground clutter be filtered from the signals prior to estimation of the reflectivity and radial velocity of weather scatterers. This report describes and analyzes a specific signal processing algorithm for ASR weather parameter measurements. An adaptively selected Finite Impulse Response high-pass filter is used for ground clutter suppression, followed by pulse-pair weather reflectivity and radial velocity estimation. Measurements from a Lincoln Laboratory-developed testbed ASR in Huntsville, Alabama are used to characterize the ground clutter environment under siting conditions that are representative of operational ASRs. Temporal fluctuations in ground clutter intensity are analyzed with attention to their impact on the adaptive clutter-filter selection procedure. The performance of the signal processing algorithms is then analyzed using the testbed ASR ground clutter measurements in combination with simulated or real weather signals. We conclude that ground clutter and the requisite Clutter filtering will not severely distort ASR wind shear measurements when the reflectivity factor of the microburst or gust front is approximately 20 dBz or greater. This is typically the case for microbursts occurring in moist conditions such as prevail over the Eastern United States during summer...|$|R

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Since 1990, the <b>Airport</b> <b>Surveillance</b> Radar- 9 (ASR- 9) has been installed and commissioned at more than 130 airports in the United States. The ASR- 9 provides aircraft detection and false alarm performance that is superior to that of earlier generations of <b>airport</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radars.</b> The ASR- 9 uses two types of surveillance to monitor aircraft activity. In primary or skin <b>surveillance,</b> the <b>radar</b> transmits a pulse of electromagnetic energy that is reflected by the metal components of an aircraft. Secondary, or beacon, surveillance uses a second antenna mounted on top of the ASR- 9 primary antenna to interrogate a transponder device located on board all commercial and most general aviation aircraft. The transponder reply is contains identification code or altitude. The ASR- 9 is designed to operate as a standalone radar or in conjunction with the Mod...|$|R

These radars, because of location, rapid scan rate, and direct {{air traffic control}} (ATe) data link, can also provide flight controllers with timely information on weather conditions that are hazardous to aircraft. With an added processingchannel, anupgradedASRcanautomatically detect regions oflow-altitude wind shear. This upgrade can provide wind shear warnings at airports where low traffic volume or infrequent thunderstorm activity precludes the deployment of a dedicated Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR). Field measurements and analysis conducted by Lincoln Laboratory indicate that the principal technical challenges for low-altitude wind shear detection with an ASR-groundclutter suppression, estimation of near-surface radial velocity, and automatic wind shear hazard recognition-ean be successfully met for microbursts accompanied by rain at the surface.

50|$|During January 17, Eric's {{well defined}} eye {{came into the}} range of Nadi <b>airports</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar,</b> before TCWC Nadi {{estimated}} that Eric had peaked with 10-minute sustained wind-speeds of 150 km/h (90 mph).

The United Thunderstorm activity and associated low-altitude wind shear constitute a significant safety hazard to aviation, particular during operations near airport terminals where aircraft altitude is low and flight routes are constrained. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has procured several dedicated meteorological sensors (Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR), Network Expansion Low Level Wind Shear Alert System (LLWAS)) at major airports to enhance the safety and efficiency ofoperations during convective weather. A hardware and software modification to existing <b>Airport</b> <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Radars</b> (ASR- 9) -the Weather Systems Processor (WSP) -will provide similar capabilities at much lower cost, thus allowing the FAA to extend its protection envelope to medium density airports and airports where thunderstorm activity is less frequent.

50|$|During January 18, Nigel's eyewall {{started to}} appear on Nadi <b>airports</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar,</b> as it had started to move south-eastwards towards Fiji.

At around the same time, it was estimated that Nigel had peaked with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 150 km/h (90 mph), which made it equivalent to a category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale. During January 19, as the system moved closer towards Nadi its eye became more distinct on the radar, which showed that Nigel had started to slowly weaken, possibly due to strong vertical wind shear and dry air driven up from higher latitudes by Cyclone Eric. Later that day at around 04:00 UTC (16:00 FST), the system passed near Fiji's southern Yasawa Islands and northern Mamanuca Islands. The centre of Nigel's eye subsequently made landfall on Fiji's largest island Viti Levu about an hour later, while equivalent to a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. As Nigel moved inland it rapidly weakened due to frictional forces and became equivalent to a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale. The system subsequently emerged into the Pacific Ocean later that day, before it passed through the Tongan Islands and to the south of Niue during January 20. Nigel weakened below tropical cyclone intensity during January 22, before it was last noted during January 28, while located about 800 km to the north of Auckland, New Zealand.|$|R

The United The Weather Systems Processor (WSP) modification to existing <b>Airport</b> <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Radars</b> (ASR- 9) significantly enhances the functionality of the radar with respect to hazardous weather detection and tracking. Dedicated alphanumeric and color graphic displays alert controllers to hazardous wind shear conditions on the runways or final approach/initial departure flight corridors, show current location and anticipated movement of thunderstorm cells, and provide short-term forecasts of operationally significant wind shifts. Operational tests of a prototype WSP and related terminal area hazardous weather detection systems (the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) and the Integrated Terminal Weather System (ITWS » have shown that, in addition to reducing the risk of aircraft accidents associated with wind shear encounters on landing or takeoff, the information provided by these systems is a significant aid in terminal air traffic management during adverse weather. The resulting efficiency enhancements reduce delay and associated costs. This report assesses the magnitude of the delay aversion benefits that will be realized through national deployment of the WSP. These are quantified both in terms of aircraft delay-hour reductions and corresponding dollar benefits. The analysis indicates that these benefits will total approximately $ 18 M per year given year 2000 expected traffic counts at the 34 planned WSP airports. This exceeds, in equivalent dollar value, the safety benefits realized through WSP deployment by a factor of approximately five. iii TABLE OF CONTENTS Section ~ Abstract 11...|$|R
5000|$|On January 13, 1985 the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) {{started to}} monitor a shallow depression, that had {{developed}} within the monsoon trough about 835 km {{to the west}} of Espiritu Santo, Vanuatu. Over the next day as the system moved eastwards it developed further, with satellite imagery showing an increase in the [...] "cyclonic curvature" [...] of the [...] "convective cloud". As a result, early on January 14, the Joint Typhoon Warning Centre (JTWC) reported that the systems chances of becoming a tropical cyclone were good. During that day the system rapidly developed further and became better defined with gale-force winds developing near the centre, with the JTWC initiating advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 11P at 12:00 UTC (00:00 FST). Four hours later as the system moved closer to Espiritu Santo, the FMS named the system Eric as it had become equivalent to a category 1 tropical cyclone on the modern day Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Eric subsequently passed near or over Espiritu Santo during January 15, before it turned and accelerated south-eastwards. Eric subsequently became equivalent to a category 3 severe tropical cyclone early the next day, before an Air Pacific flight from Fiji to the Solomon Islands located the systems eye on radar. The eye subsequently appeared on satellite imagery later that day, before it came into the range of Nadi <b>airports</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> at around 00:30 UTC (12:30 FST) on January 17. The FMS were subsequently able to perform fixes on the systems eye until around 07:00 UTC (19:00 FST), when the radars antenna had to be taken down and locked away as the wind speeds at Nadi increased.|$|R
