The drug-dependent phenotype of each mutant was caused by a single amino acid substitution in the VP 1 coat protein. The three independent mutations conferring drug dependence are M 1103 T, T 1208 A, and V 1210 A. Single-step growth experiments involving rescue of one of the three mutants (V 1210 A) by delayed drug addition suggested (i) that the drug dependence lesion is at the stage of virus assembly and (ii) that one or more components of the viral assembly pool decay in the absence of drug.

40|$|Assembly {{sequence}} planning (ASP) {{becomes one}} of the major challenges in product design and manufacturing. A good assembly sequence leads to reduced costs and duration in the manufacturing process. However, assembly sequence planning is known to be a classical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem; ASP with many product components becomes more difficult to solve. In this paper, an approach based on a new variant of the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) called the rule-based multi-state gravitational search algorithm (RBMSGSA) is used to solve the assembly sequence planning problem. As in the gravitational search algorithm, the RBMSGSA incorporates Newton’s law of gravity, the law of motion, and a rule that makes each <b>assembly</b> <b>component</b> of each individual solution occur once based on precedence constraints; the best feasible sequence of assembly can then be determined. To verify the feasibility and performance of the proposed approach, a case study has been performed and a comparison has been conducted against other three approaches based on simulated annealing (SA), a genetic algorithm (GA), and binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO).

40|$|Dimensional {{variation}} in assembly processes {{is one of}} the most important issues that affect quality. Although robust design and statistical process quality control help to reduce this problem, they cannot be used for instant variation reduction during assembly operations, especially during process ramp-up. This paper introduces a complete methodology for dimensional-related error compensation in compliant sheet metal assembly processes. The proposed methodology is divided into two steps: (1) an off-line error control-learning module using virtual assembly models to determine necessary adjustments; and (2) an in-line control implementation using a feed-forward control strategy based on the learned adjustments. The off-line learning step focuses on determining control actions or corrections to compensate for the negative effects incoming part errors have on Key Product Characteristics. Specifically, it utilizes a newly developed iterative sampling method based on Kriging fitting to efficiently determine optimal control actions. The in-line feed-forward control identifies appropriate part-by-part adjustments using these learned control actions and incoming <b>assembly</b> <b>component</b> measurements. In this paper, two case studies are presented. First, a mathematical case study presents an empirical proof for the feasibility of the Iterative Sampling and Fitting Algorithm. Second, a simulation-based case study illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology to improve dimensional quality in assembly operations for compliant sheet metal parts...|$|E
40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{has been}} widely used in {{pressure}} drop/hydraulic loss calculations in many industries, including the aerospace and turbo-machinery industry {{as well as in}} the nuclear power industry. During the past 30 years, a significant amount of time and effort have been spent in benchmarking the CFD tools and models against test data in aerospace and turbo-machinery industry. The application of the CFD methods in the nuclear power industry is relatively new in comparison and has accelerated in recent years. This paper focuses on the benchmarking of the CFD modeling of Westinghouse fuel assemblies. The pressure drop across the fuel assembly is a very important characteristic to consider in the design of any new fuel assembly design. The ability to accurately predict the pressure drop across the fuel assembly is critical in nuclear fuel design. In this paper, the effect of the turbulence model in the CFD modeling is investigated. Different computational meshes are generated and evaluated. The results show that the turbulence model and mesh density both have a significant effect on the pressure drop predictions. A well calibrated modeling procedure is needed to meet the strict requirements of the nuclear power industry. This paper shows that a well calibrated CFD model shortens the design cycle and saves costs in the development of new fuel assembly components. Most importantly, it enables Westinghouse to more easily investigate new fuel <b>assembly</b> <b>component</b> designs, some of which were never thought possible before because of the involved development process. 1...|$|E
