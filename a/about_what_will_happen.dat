25|$|One of the {{recurring}} storylines involves Garfield getting lost or running away. The longest {{one of these}} lasted for over a month (in 1986 August 25 to September 28); it began with Jon telling Garfield to go get the newspaper. Garfield walks outside to get it, but speculates <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> if he wanders off – and decides to find out. Jon notices Garfield has been gone too long, so he sends Odie out to find him. He quickly realizes his mistake (Odie, being not too bright, also gets lost).

He is not descriptive, so animals including an elephant, monkeys, a seal, a snake, a kangaroo and joey, and turtles are brought to Jon's house for the reward. After a series of events, including Odie being adopted by a small girl, both pets meeting up at a circus that they briefly joined, and both going to a pet shop, Garfield and Odie make it back home.|$|E

For that, our small and medium companies and the new people who wants to get up a work (entrepreneurs), are living a difficult moment to find someone, who finance a new business project. In addition to being a difficult moment, the financing condition has become harder. For that in this work, we would like to show like a financial alternative the Venture Capital. We start getting the attention in Venture Capital meaning, deepening in the advantages that the Venture Capital provides in our economic activity, entrepreneurs and whole the society. On the other hand, we will develop the process that the venture capital companies and the companies who receives the money, be followed, If they want to participate in this kind of financial alternative. Moreover, we will analyze a successful business studio about Softonic S. A, in which we´ll try to make easier and understandable everything that we have demonstrated during the work, showing; Equity activity and the benefits provided by it, with hard data. To conclude, we analyze by economic equations, two of the most important objectives by Venture Capital, at the moment in which the out of the company it produces: Creation value in the participate company, and generating the capital gains for the investors. To verify this information, we used three important economics equations; WACC, VAN (It shows what our company is worth today) and TIR (it measures, how much we have received {{at the end of the}} investment. In conclusion, we try to defend the venture capital as a suitable financing alternative for companies to increase their business value and getting benefits for people who bets on an investment.

40|$|Research {{shows that}} {{negation}} can suppress the activation of propositions presented explicitly in text, but does negation {{have a similar}} effect on propositions that can be inferred? That is, does negation inhibit the inference process? Four experiments investigated whether a deductive inference that produces a negated conclusion (therefore not a) is made as readily as a similar inference form that yields an affirmative conclusion (therefore a). A combination of naming latencies, verification times, and reading times indicate that negation {{does not affect the}} deductive inference process itself, although it may inhibit the activation of inferred concepts.

Galen, like the Hippocratics, was not. For him, to understand a clinical case technically, ‘to diagnose’, was, among other things, to know with greater or lesser certainty the outcome for the patient, ‘to prognosticate’. Prognosis, then, is one of the essential problems and most important objectives of Galenic diagnosis. Galen was concerned to distinguish it from divination or prophecy, both to improve diagnosis technically and to enhance the physician's reputation." ...|$|E

When Karl asks where Susan's wedding ring is, Susan tells him that she threw {{it out of her}} car on a dirt road not knowing that it was a family heirloom. Karl then makes Susan go searching through Route 7 until they find the ring. Later, Edie finds a pre-nup and Susan's ring in Karl's briefcase. Edie takes this as proof that Karl is going to propose that evening. At the restaurant, Edie thinks Karl ordering souffle is proof of the proposal since he could put the ring in the cake. Edie then spots Susan and Dr. Ron eating at another table and drags Susan into the restroom with her. She tells Susan that she may be getting engaged and Susan tries to talk her down which causes Edie to leave the restroom still hopeful <b>about</b> <b>what</b> she thinks <b>will</b> <b>happen.</b> As the souffles arrive, Edie sticks her hand in it and Karl asks her what she is doing.

60|$|Let {{me explain}} myself. I said just now that superstition means anxiety <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> to us after we die. But people {{commonly}} understand by superstition, religious ceremonies, like the Popish ones, which God has not commanded. And {{that is not}} a wrong meaning either; for people take to these ceremonies from over- anxiety about the next life. The one springs out of the other; the outward conduct out of the inward fear; and both spring alike out of a false notion of God, which the Devil (whose great aim is to hinder us from knowing our Father in Heaven) puts into men's minds. Man feels that he is sinful and unrighteous; the light of Christ in his heart shows him that, and it shows him {{at the same time that}} God is sinless and righteous. 'Then,' he says, 'God must hate sin;' and there he says true. Then steps in the slanderer, Satan, and whispers, 'But you are sinful; therefore God hates you, and wills you harm, and torture, and ruin.' And the poor man believes that lying voice, and will believe it to the end, whether he be Christian or heathen, until he believes the Bible and the Sacraments, which tell him, 'God does not hate you: He hates your sins, and loves you; He wills not your misery but your happiness; and therefore God's will, yea, God's earnest endeavour, is to raise you out of those sins of yours, which make you miserable now, and which, if you go on in them, must bring of themselves everlasting misery to you.' Of themselves; not by any arbitrary decree of God (whereof the Bible says not one single word from beginning to end), that He will inflict on you so much pain for so much sin: but by the very nature of sin; for to sin is to be parted from God, in whose presence alone is life, and therefore sin is, to be in death. Sin is, to be at war with God, who is love and peace; and therefore to be in lovelessness, hatred, war, and misery. Sin is, to act contrary to the constitution which God gave man, when He said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness;' and therefore sin is a disease in human nature, and like all other diseases, must, unless it is checked, go on everlastingly and perpetually breeding weakness, pain and torment. And out of that God is so desirous to raise you, that He spared not His only begotten Son, but freely gave Him for you, if by any means He might raise you out of that death of sin to the life of righteousness--to a righteous life; to a life of Duty--to a dutiful life, like His Son Jesus Christ's life; for that must go on, if you go on in it, producing in you everlastingly and perpetually all health and strength, usefulness and happiness in this world and all worlds to come.|$|E

6000|$|To know that, I fear, {{we must go}} back many many hundred years, to {{the times}} when the old martyrs confessed the Lord Jesus Christ before the heathen. Those were times {{in which it was}} not enough to say the Apostles' Creed in church. Men, ay, and tender women, and little children, had to stand by it through terror and shame, and to die in torments unspeakable, because they chose to say: [...] "I believe in Jesus Christ, our Lord." [...] Now, what was it which made the heathen hate and persecute and torture, and murder them for saying that? What was there in those plain words of the Apostles' Creed which made the great heathen {{emperors}} of Rome, and their officers and judges hunt the Christians down like wild beasts for 300 years, and declare that they were not fit to live? I will tell you. When the Christians were brought before the emperor's judges for being Christians, they did not merely say: [...] "I believe that Jesus Christ's blood will save my soul after death." [...] They said that: but they said a great deal more than that. If that had been all that the Christians said, the judge would have answered: [...] "What care I for your souls, or for your notions <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> to them when you are dead? Go your way. You may be of what religion you like, and talk and think about your own souls as much as you like, provided you do not trouble the Roman emperor's power." [...] But the heathen judge did not make that answer; because he knew well enough that what the Christians believed was not a mere religion about what would happen to their souls after death; but something which, if it gained ground, would utterly destroy the Roman emperor's power. He used generally to say to the Christians only this: [...] "Will you burn those few grains of incense in honour of the emperor of Rome?" [...] And he knew, and the Christians knew well enough, that those words meant: [...] "Will you confess with your mouth the emperor of Rome? Will you confess that he is the only lord and king of this whole earth, and of your bodies and souls, and that there is no power or authority but of him, for the gods have delivered all things into his hands?" [...] And then came out what confessing the Lord Jesus really means. For the Christians used to answer: [...] "No. The emperor of Rome is the lord and master of our bodies, and we will obey his laws so far as we can without doing wrong: but we cannot obey them when they are contrary to the laws of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ. For the Lord Jesus Christ, who was crucified and rose again the third day, He, and not the emperor of Rome at all, is the Lord and King of the whole earth, and of our bodies and souls; and we must obey Him before we obey anyone else. Power and authority come not from the emperor of Rome, but from the Lord Jesus Christ; and the emperor is only His servant and steward, and must obey Him just as much as we, or the Lord will punish him as surely and easily as He will the meanest slave. For God has delivered all things, and the emperor of Rome among the rest, into the hand of His Son Jesus Christ, who sits a King over all, God blessed for ever." [...] That was confessing Christ.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But,' say some, 'is not {{salvation}} {{going to}} a place called heaven?' My friends, let the Bible speak. It tells us that salvation {{is not in a}} place at all, but in a person, a living, moving, acting person, who is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ. Let the Psalmists speak, and shame us, who ought to know (being Christians) even better than they, that The Lord Himself is Salvation. The whole Book of Psalms, what is it but the blessed discovery that salvation is not merely in a place, or a state, not even in some 'beatific vision' after men die; but in the Lord Himself all day long in this world; that salvation is a life in God and with God? 'The Lord is my light, and my salvation, of whom then shall I be afraid? The Lord is the strength of my life, and my portion for ever.' This is their key-note. Shame on us Christians, that we should have forgotten it for one so much lower. 'The name of the Lord,' says Solomon, 'is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.' Into it: not merely into some pleasant place after he dies, but all day long; and is safe: not merely after he dies, but in every chance and change of this mortal life. My friends, I am ashamed to have to put Christian men in mind of these things. Truly, 'Evil communications have corrupted good manners; awake to righteousness and sin not, for some have not the knowledge of God.' I am ashamed, I say; for there are old hymns in the mouths of every one to this day, which testify against their want of faith; which say, 'Christ is my life,' 'Christ is my salvation;' and which were written, I doubt not, by men who meant literally what they said, whatever those who sing them now-a-days may mean by them. Now what do those hymns mean by such words, if they mean anything at all? Surely what I have been preaching to you, and what seems to some of you, I fear, strange and new doctrine. And what else does the Church Catechism mean, when it bids every child thank God for having brought him into a state of salvation? For mind, throughout the whole Church Catechism there is not one word about what people commonly call heaven and hell; not one word though 'heaven and hell' are now-a-days generally the first things about which children are taught. Not one word is the child taught <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> to him after death, except that his body will rise again, and that Christ will be his Judge after he is dead as well as while he is alive: but not one word about that salvation after he is dead, which is almost the only thing of which one hears in many pulpits. And why, but because the Catechism teaches the child to believe that Jesus Christ is his salvation now, in this life, and believes that to be enough for him to know? For if Christ be eternal, His salvation must be eternal also. If Christ's life be in the child, eternal life must be in the child; for Christ's life must be eternal, even as Christ Himself; and that is enough for the child, and for us also.|$|E
