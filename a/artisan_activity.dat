5000|$|Edmund Cartwright first {{proposed}} building a weaving machine that would function similar to recently developed cotton-spinning mills in 1784, drawing scorn from critics {{who said the}} weaving process was too nuanced to automate. He built a factory at Doncaster and obtained a series of patents between 1785 and 1792. In 1788, his brother Major John Cartwight built Revolution Mill at Retford (named for the centenary of the Glorious Revolution). In 1791, he licensed his loom to the Grimshaw brothers of Manchester, but their Knott Mill burnt down the following year (possibly a case of arson). Edmund Cartwight was granted a reward of £10,000 by Parliament for his efforts in 1809. [...] However, success in power-weaving also required improvements by others, including H. Horrocks of Stockport. Only during the two decades after about 1805, did power-weaving take hold. At that time there were 250,000 hand weavers in the UK. [...] Textile manufacture {{was one of the}} leading sectors in the British Industrial Revolution, but weaving was a comparatively late sector to be mechanised. The loom became semi-automatic in 1842 with Kenworthy and Bulloughs Lancashire Loom. The various innovations took weaving from a home-based <b>artisan</b> <b>activity</b> (labour-intensive and man-powered) to steam driven factories process. A large metal manufacturing industry grew to produce the looms, firms such as Howard & Bullough of Accrington, and Tweedales and Smalley and Platt Brothers. Most power weaving took place in weaving sheds, in small towns circling Greater Manchester away from the cotton spinning area. The earlier combination mills where spinning and weaving took place in adjacent buildings became rarer. Wool and worsted weaving took place in West Yorkshire and particular Bradford, here there were large factories such as Lister's or Drummond's, where all the processes took place. Both men and women with weaving skills emigrated, and took the knowledge to their new homes in New England, to places like Pawtucket and Lowell.|$|E

La Actividad Artesanal hoy en día, es un componente muy útil para el lograr el Desarrollo Turístico Sostenible de las sociedades, y Casma no ésta exento de esta realidad, es por ello que ésta actividad es {{una manera}} muy digna, por un lado de paliar la pobreza o escasez de recursos económicos, así como también de tener un oficio que se transmite de generación en generación y que se desenvuelve cada vez mejor, gracias a la creatividad, y que {{poco a poco}} ha ido optando por utilizar herramientas e insumos modernos, dejando de lado el detalle original, para crear más que todo una artesanía utilitaria, con un fin netamente comercial. En nuestra investigación y sobretodo para cumplir con el objetivo de ella, tomamos como muestra referencial a 10 artesanos de la Provincia de Casma., este número se justifica por ser los únicos que accedieron a la entrevista y así facilitaron la obtención de datos. Entendiendo que la metodología es un aspecto {{indispensable}} para la realización de un trabajo de investigación, es necesario indicar que se aplicaron el Método Histórico – Comparativo y el Método Etnográfico. Los Artesanos de Casma, en esta investigación, dieron a conocer el desarrollo de su actividad artesanal, la problemática actual de su desorganización; la línea de producción de cada uno de ellos, así como también el anhelo de superación, a través de los talleres de capacitación. 	La 	Actividad 	de 	los 	Artesanos 	en 	Casma,	presentan 	importantes potencialidades, mostradas en sus líneas artesanales, y son capaces de impulsar el desarrollo turístico sostenible de la Provincia de Casma; de ser así, ésta actividad incrementaría notablemente varios aspectos del desarrollo turístico. Las características que posee le Artesanía de Casma, se expresa en la presencia de Técnicas Tradicionales y una Variedad de Productos Contemporáneos. Las Líneas de Producción con Técnicas Tradicionales son: Tallado en Piedra y Redes de Pescar; y las que se elaboran con Técnicas Contemporáneas son: Manualidades, Tejidos, Macramé y Bordado, Tallado en Piedra, Juguetería – Decoración, Bijoutería–Cerámica, Artículos Decorativos, Productos Decorativos Con Material Malacológico - Conchas Marinas; que sirven y mejoran el desarrollo de la Actividad Artesanal, el mismo que influye al Desarrollo Sostenible de la Provincia y ayuda sobretodo a Complementar éste atractivo con el ya existente, que es el Monumento Arqueológico de Sechín. Con un ente motivador que impulse a los artesanos a organizarse y con la apertura de Talleres de Capacitación en temas de: Administración de PYMES, Marketing, Tecnología de Producción y Ventas (Atención al Cliente); y con un buen manejo empresarial, lograremos obtener artesanos calificados con productos artesanales reconocido y más cotizados en el mercado regional, nacional e internacional. Por lo tanto, conocedores del diagnóstico de la Actividad Artesanal en Casma, sólo nos queda fomentar, motivar, apoyar y ejecutar proyectos de desarrollo en bien de los artesanos casmeños, para que en un futuro no muy lejano, hacer que se incremente el flujo de la demanda turística y en consecuencia en el desarrollo económico (directa e indirecta), así mismo, involucrar a toda la comunidad casmeña (ofreciendo servicios turísticos: familiar y comunal) y tener la participación de las organizaciones sociales, instituciones y sobretodo la presencia de la empresa privada, todo ello enmarcado el desarrollo de la sostenibilidad sociocultural y económica de esta parte del país.

In our investigation and coverall to fulfill the objective of her, we took as it shows referential 10 craftsmen of the Province of Casma., this number is justified for being the only ones who acceded thus to the interview and facilitated the obtaining of data. Understanding that the methodology is an aspect indispensable for the accomplishment of a work of investigation, it is necessary to indicate that they were applied the Historical Method - Comparative and the Ethnographic Method.

30|$|Diversification of {{livelihood}} {{is a major}} adaptation strategy {{practiced by}} more than 58  % of the respondents. Due to the frequency of droughts, a majority of households around the periurban centers and along Turkwel River undertake many activities to augment resources from livestock production. In this study, livelihood diversification refers to processes by which households construct a diverse portfolio of activities and social support capabilities in their struggle for survival {{and in order to}} improve their standards of living (Ellis 1995). This implies that livelihood diversification is not synonymous with income diversification. According to Reardon and Vosti (1995), the rationale for diversification is to create a portfolio of livelihoods with different risk attributes so that drought risk can be managed in advance of moisture deficit and recovery is quicker and easier after the event. This study indicates that the majority (81.46  %, n =  246) of the respondents engage in livelihood diversification activities, while a number (35.1  %, n =  106) are still dependent on climate sensitive activities. These climate sensitive activities include mainly crop farming (sorghum, maize, green grams/mung beans, cowpeas, and vegetables), poultry and egg production, and aloe harvesting. The majority of respondents prefer to engage in nonclimate-sensitive activities such as microbusiness, casual labor, <b>artisan</b> <b>activities,</b> salaried fixed employment, and charcoal production. Other activities include harvesting of wild fruits for food, honey production, basket making, and handicraft products (for example baskets and brooms) crafted from the palm tree. According to key informants, most of these livelihood diversification activities are adapted to complement pastoralism, rather than to substitute for livestock production. Interestingly, Watson and van Binsbergen (2006) reported that most of these livelihood diversification activities are practiced by women in Turkana. While no gender aggregation in terms of women and men roles was analyzed in this study, other studies (Fernando 2002; Njiru 2012) have shown an increasing involvement of women in livelihood diversification in the study area.|$|R

Nalazi brončanih i koštanih predmeta otkriveni su u naseobinskom i grobišnom kontekstu, a nalazište Popernjak pripada kasnome brončanom dobu i kulturnoj skupini Barice-Gređani, odnosno Br D i Ha A 1 stupnjevima. Brončani predmeti (ukrasne igle, narukvice, alkice, ukrasne ploče) pokazuju svojstva karakteristična za šire područje dok su nalazi koštanih predmeta jedinstveni i bez značajnijih paralela. I jedna i druga skupina predmeta osvjetljava obrtničku djelatnost prapovijesnih stanovnika, neki predmeti predstavljaju standardan, gotovo serijski proizvod, na nekima se jasno raspoznaju elementi umjetničkoga obrta. The author {{discusses}} {{bronze and}} bone finds from Popernjak near Bošnjaci in East Croatia (Figs. 1 and 2). The bronze and bone items were recovered from settlement and grave site contexts. It {{is hard to}} determine whether the bronze items from Popernjak (Tables 1 to 3, Fig. 3) had been imported or were locally made. Their typological unity and presence over a large area support the opinion that they had been imported. However, some of the items, such as the mace-like needle in Fig. 3. 3, Table 2. 4, and the recovery of a chisel (Table 1. 7), speak in favour of local production. An accurate analysis of other bronze items, of course, could provide indications if not of local metallurgic then at least of local blacksmith production. On the other hand, when talking about bone items (Table 4), we can talk without doubt about local craftsmanship production. This is corroborated by the uniqueness of the items themselves (fife, reinforcements) that have no parallel examples, and also by the way they were decorated and the choice of decorative motifs. Bronze and bone items from Popernjak (Tables 1 - 4, Fig. 3), although they are artefacts of applied arts, indicate an accentuated tendency towards artistic expression, at least when it comes to decorations. Bronze and bone items from Popernjak have been dated with certainty in the early phase of the Late Bronze Age, or, more precisely, to Br D and Ha A 1. The production of artistic craft items, such as those discovered in Popernjak, implies the use of the basic techniques of casting and minting, while predominant features in the ornamenting system are incision and sculptural applications. Bone items from the graves in Popernjak were made of tubular animal bones, and apart from the primary execution, the decoration was executed by carving and incision. Geometric motifs are dominant, both with bronze and bone items (T. 1 - 4, Fig. 3). Bronze items (decorative pins, bracelets, ringlets, decorative plates) show traits characteristically observed in the wider area, while the bone items are unique and have no significant parallels. Both groups of items shed light on the <b>artisan</b> <b>activity</b> of the prehistoric inhabitants. While some items represent a standard and almost serial production, others bear clear traits of artistic expression...|$|E
40|$|It {{is often}} {{assumed that the}} {{globalization}} {{of the world economy}} will drive societies and societal change in a broadly similar direction, leading to convergence in the process of urbanization. The observed diversity between places {{is the result of the}} engagement of the macroeconomic process with local social and political structures. Inner-city decline in many older metropolitan centers of the USA and the United Kingdom has occurred through economic restructuring and job loss, with smaller urban centers and amenity-rich areas benefiting concomitantly. Demographic processes have accentuated this decline: most notably suburbanization, counterurbanization, inner-city renewal programs, and urban resettlement to new towns. Since the early 1980 s, however, selected inner cities have been the focus of reinvestment, and a return of population through so-called 'gentrification'. In the United Kingdom, in particular, public policy has played an important role in the reinvigoration of inner cities. The substantial literature on UK and US cities is reviewed insofar as it might shed light on convergent processes in Latin American inner cities. In fact, the evidence suggests little convergence. The demography is different, with relatively low levels of visible population decline; and the economy of the inner city remains vibrant, focusing upon services and small- scale <b>artisan</b> <b>activities,</b> with no corresponding decline in heavy industry. Although large-scale redevelopment projects in and around the downtown were common during the 1940 s to the 1960 s, the demise of authoritarian and dirigiste-type leaders, 1980 s austerity, and a growing democratic base, have imposed severe limitations on the extent of large-scale urban redevelopment and reinvestment. Cultural and aesthetic influences also militate against a demand from the middle-income and upper-income groups to gentrify the inner city; nor is the 'rent-gap' sufficient to stimulate private-sector supply of new or refurbished homes a likely option in the city center. Policy prescriptions in Latin America should take account of this divergence and fundamental differences in kind, and should aim to develop existing opportunities and land uses for an incumbent working-class population, rather than seeking to attract new uses and better-off populations into the core. ...|$|R

Presently, 29 species of fishes and two invertebrates are fished (along {{with a group of}} species reported as "non-identified"), primarily from the 10 main fishing grounds within 5 nm from the shore. Sporadic fishing trips reach areas up to 25 nm offshore. Statistics about the artisan fleet and number of operative fishers is spotty and unreliable. In 2011 SERNAPESCA reported 123 artisan fishers and 31 boats for the island. Landings occur in five coves, of which Hanga Piko and Hanga Roa are the most important. Between 2000 - 2009 the mean annual landing ranged between 109 - 171 ton. The main exploited resources during this period were yellowfin tuna, snoek, Pacific rudderfin, rainbow runner, glasseye, oilfish, deep-water jack and swordfish.

If an instruction was not complied with, all the settlers had been severely punished no matter what reason they had for not to do the job in time. Sometimes the instruction strictly specified a certain day for a certain job, and if it was rainy at such day, the job could not be done. Since the instruction was not complied again, settlers got severe punishment. State officials including Arakcheyev knew little about agriculture. In Saint Petersburg area peasants had been practicing hunting, fishing, small <b>artisan</b> production, trade <b>activities</b> for a long time, because northern soil did not fit for agriculture. When military settlements had been implemented near Saint Petersburg, all the settlers had been prescribed to grow wheat and other activities out of law, this led to impoverishment of local population and malnourishment. Due to such circumstances the military performance of settlers was low. They were not effective as soldiers. And they were not agriculture workers indeed.|$|R
40|$|Almost all Italian {{cities and}} town have an {{historical}} city centres, built in Roman or medieval times, characterised by narrow and winding lanes, often leading uphill, with a dense housing structure. The charm and liveliness {{of the city}} centres depends on the its ability to conciliate the very many urban functions and activities that they host: houses and apartments for the various income groups (often low-income family but with a tendency to “gentrification”); <b>artisan</b> and craftsman <b>activities</b> (carpenters, tailors, watchmakers, jewellers, bakers, plumbers etc.), administrative offices (courts, tax offices); kindergartens and schools; local shops (clothing and shoes, chemists, house appliances) and retailers (bakeries, fruit&vegetables shops, cheese shops, dry food shops, butchers, fish mongers, florists); hotels, bars, restaurants and pizzerias. All these activities generate an strong demand for good supply from the local wholesalers and producers, particularly {{because they have a}} very small storage space at the disposal. However, goods distribution in the narrow and winding lanes of the Italian historical city centres is not an easy task: the lorry must be small and the parking places are very limited. Moreover, the interaction between passenger and goods vehicles traffic make congestion almost inevitable, especially at certain times of the day. On top of all this, tourists enjoy living and visiting the city centres and their many monuments and churches. And {{in some of the most}} famous Italian cities (e. g., Rome, Venice, Florence but also Pisa, Siena, Urbino and so on), tourism is the main source of income for the activities located in the city centre. Hence, finding the right balance between goods distribution and tourism is not an easy task...|$|R
30|$|However, the {{researcher}} {{observed that the}} respondents were predominantly involved in 5 major economic activities. The greater {{percentage of the total}} respondents was engaged in farming activities (65 %) than non-farming activities (35 %) for the purpose of generating income which was used to enhance their livelihood. The study observed that most respondents from other employment such as trading, civil service, <b>artisan</b> and fishing <b>activities</b> were also involved in farming. Moreover, the analysis of variance on the economic activities that generated more income to the households in the study area shows that farming activities provided more opportunities for income generation. Apart from trading with few manufactured goods, most of the industries in the study area use the raw materials sourced locally especially from farm produce. Therefore, the livelihood of the households living in the study area predominantly depends on agriculture. Consequently, poor regions of the world, such as Africa, which depends on agriculture, have been described {{as one of the most}} vulnerable regions to the impacts of climatic and environmental changes, particularly drought, desertification and flood (Reid and Vogel 2008, Tschakert 2007). Thus, in-depth interviews with the key informants show that water scarcity due to the occurrence of droughts affects the agricultural outputs in the study area. There were food shortages resulting from an abnormal reduction in crop yield due to droughts. Irrigation projects which would have served to mitigate these problems were also affected by water shortages as most of the dams dried up during droughts, thus, exacerbates the impact of droughts on the environment and human comfort. Abaje et al. (2013) state that during drought periods, the land is under increased stress from both human beings and livestock, through unsustainable agricultural practices, leading to increasing desertification (Oyekale 2009; Eze et al. 2018). Mortimore et al. (2009) have shown that overgrazing becomes destructive during drought, when large areas that would normally have been available for grazing dry up, animals are forced to feed on any available edible vegetation they could find. This may be harsh enough to cause severe damage to the environment, particularly in the study area. Nyong et al. (2003) argue that once the unsafe balance of the plant communities adapted to the characteristically variable climate is upset by persistent drought, complete ecological recovery may be impossible, even when the rains return leading to severe desertification.|$|R
40|$|Apresentamos um estudo sobre as mudanças {{realizadas}} pelo homem sertanejo de atividade laboral rural, especificamente da agricultura, para uma nova ocupação no trabalho, o bordado, ocupação esta definida socialmente, até a atualidade, como um lugar dominado pelo gênero feminino. O cenário da pesquisa trata-se de uma localidade, situada na zona rural, do interior do estado do Ceará. Os colaboradores da pesquisa apresentam as seguintes características: gênero masculino, faixa etária acima de trinta anos, pertencentes a classe social baixa. Conduzimos este estudo utilizando autores contemporâneos, estabelecendo um diálogo entre a Psicologia, História, Antropologia e Sociologia. O corpo teórico encontra-se alicerçado na discussão das temáticas sobre: o sertão, as referências históricas na construção da identidade do sertanejo e o sentido atribuído ao trabalho. O objetivo geral da pesquisa buscou compreender a trajetória da mudança da atividade rural para uma atividade manual artesanal vivenciado pelo homem sertanejo. Os objetivos específicos são: compreender o valor atribuído ao trabalho na região sertaneja, descrever o contexto sócio-cultural que leva o sertanejo a migrar para a atividade do bordado e verificar como esse sujeito se significa no lugar do trabalho feminino. A metodologia utilizada fundamenta-se pela abordagem qualitativa, com foco etnográfico, através das entrevistas, uso de diário de campo e observaçãoparticipante. Os resultados nos mostram a adaptabilidade do sujeito sertanejo, motivada pela sobrevivência, além de uma tolerância e pouca resistência aos modelos que se apresentam como fonte alternativa de trabalho no sertão. Verificamos que essa transformação não acontece de imediato, decorre de um longo processo em que o homem foi tolhido de seu desejo. Destaca-se que o quadro atual do comportamento social, desse homem sertanejo, não se refere a uma designação reducionista, seja de forma positiva ou negativa, da sua nova ocupação no trabalho, mas essencialmente representa uma expressão singular de se mostrar e se reconhecer no seu contexto social. Palavras-chaves: trabalho, sertão nordestino, homem sertanejo e migração de atividade. We {{present a}} study on the changes carried through by the man from hinterlands who works on agricultural activity, specifically the changes from agriculture to a new occupation in the work, the embroidering, which is socially defined as dominated by the feminine sort. The scene of this research is situated in the agricultural zone, inner location of the state of Ceará. The collaborators of the research present the following characteristics: masculine sort, age above thirty years-old and belonging to low social class. We lead this study mentioning contemporary authors, establishing a dialogue between Psychology, History, Anthropology and Sociology. The theoretical content has as background the discussion on the following thematic: the hinterland, the historical references {{in the construction of the}} identity of the man from this land and the meaning attributed to the work. The general objective of the research sought to understand the trajectory of the change from the agricultural business to an <b>artisan</b> manual <b>activity</b> deeply lived by this man. The specific objectives are: to understand the value attributed to the work in the region of hinterlands, to describe the socialcultural context that takes the man from hinterlands to migrate to the activity of embroidering and to verify how this citizen sees himself in a place of feminine work. The methodology used is based on the qualitative approach, with ethnographic focus, using interviews, agenda and participant-observation. The results show us the adaptability of the citizen from hinterlands, motivated by the survival, as well as tolerance and little resistance to the models that are presented as alternative source of work in the hinterland. We verify that this transformation does not happen immediately, it happens due to a long process where the man has been refrained from his desire. It is distinguished that the current picture of the social behavior, of the hinterland s man, does not relate to a reductionist assignment, either in a positive or negative way, in his new occupation at work, but it represents essentially a singular expression of showing and recognizing himself in his social context. Key-words: work, northeastern hinterland, man from the hinterland and migration of activity...|$|R
