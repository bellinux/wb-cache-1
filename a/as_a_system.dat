5|$|After {{the decline}} in Linnaeus' health in the early 1770s, {{publication}} of editions of Systema Naturae went in two different directions. Another Swedish scientist, Johan Andreas Murray issued the Regnum Vegetabile section separately in 1774 as the Systema Vegetabilium, rather confusingly labelled the 13th edition. Meanwhile a 13th edition of the entire Systema appeared in parts between 1788 and 1793. It was through the Systema Vegetabilium that Linnaeus' work became widely known in England, following its translation from the Latin by the Lichfield Botanical Society <b>as</b> <b>A</b> <b>System</b> of Vegetables (1783–1785).|$|E
5|$|Dworkin {{authored}} ten {{books of}} radical feminist theory and numerous speeches and articles, each designed to assert {{the presence of}} and denounce institutionalized and normalized harm against women. She {{became one of the}} most influential writers and spokeswomen of American radical feminism during the late 1970s and the 1980s. She characterized pornography as an industry of damaging objectification and abuse, not merely a fantasy realm. She discussed prostitution <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of exploitation, and intercourse as a key site of subordination in patriarchy. Her analysis and writing influenced and inspired the work of contemporary feminists, such as Catharine MacKinnon, Gloria Steinem, John Stoltenberg, Nikki Craft, Susan Cole, and Amy Elman.|$|E
5|$|Ecclesiastical {{heraldry}} {{refers to}} the use of heraldry within the Christian Church for dioceses and Christian clergy. Initially used to mark documents, ecclesiastical heraldry evolved <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> for identifying people and dioceses. It is most formalized within the Catholic Church, where most bishops, including the Pope, have a personal coat of arms. Clergy in Anglican, Lutheran, Eastern Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches follow similar customs, as do institutions such as schools and dioceses.|$|E

5|$|Grammar can be {{described}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of categories {{and a set of}} rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning. Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically distinguishing between their relations to a predicate, the encoding of temporal and spatial relations on predicates, and a system of grammatical person governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.|$|E
5|$|Heraldry {{developed}} in medieval Europe {{from the late}} 11th century, originally <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of personal badges of the warrior classes, which served, among other purposes, as identification on the battlefield. The same insignia were used on seals to identify documents. The earliest seals bore a likeness of {{the owner of the}} seal, with the shield and heraldic insignia included. Over time, the seals were reduced to just the shield.|$|E
5|$|Nike-X {{had been}} {{defined in the}} early 1960s <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> to defend US cities and {{industrial}} centers against a heavy Soviet attack during the 1970s. By 1965 the growing fleets of ICBMs in the inventories of both the US and USSR were making the cost of such a system very expensive. NIE 11-8-63, published 18 October 1963, estimated the Soviets would have 400–700 ICBMs deployed by 1969, and their deployment eventually reached 1,601 launchers, limited by the SALT agreements.|$|E

5|$|The structuralist {{movement}} originated {{primarily from}} the work of Durkheim as interpreted by two European anthropologists. Anthony Giddens' theory of structuration draws on the linguistic theory of Ferdinand de Saussure and the French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss. In this context, 'structure' refers not to 'social structure' but to the semiotic understanding of human culture <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of signs. One may delineate four central tenets of structuralism: First, structure is what determines the structure of a whole. Second, structuralists believe that every system has a structure. Third, structuralists are interested in 'structural' laws that deal with coexistence rather than changes. Finally, structures are the 'real things' beneath the surface or the appearance of meaning.|$|E
5|$|Theories {{about the}} origin of {{language}} differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language is. Some theories are {{based on the idea that}} language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on Chomsky's generative view of language see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> that is largely cultural, learned through social interaction.|$|E
5|$|When {{described}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> {{of symbolic}} communication, language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: signs, meanings, and a code connecting signs with their meanings. The {{study of the}} process of semiosis, how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called semiotics. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.|$|E

5|$|Yoga gurus from India later {{introduced}} yoga to the west, {{following the}} success of Swami Vivekananda in the late 19th and early 20th century. In the 1980s, yoga became popular <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of physical exercise across the Western world. Yoga in Indian traditions, however, is more than physical exercise; it has a meditative and spiritual core. One of the six major orthodox schools of Hinduism is also called Yoga, {{which has its own}} epistemology and metaphysics, and is closely related to Hindu Samkhya philosophy.|$|E
5|$|His police cadet {{system was}} allowed to lapse after his retirement, but it was re-introduced by John McKinna, another former soldier, who became {{commissioner}} in 1957. He remained a strong advocate of part-time soldiering, as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of universal military training. Leane lived in Adelaide until his death at the Repatriation General Hospital, Daw Park on 25 June 1962, {{with him and his}} wife celebrating their diamond wedding anniversary two weeks before his death. He was buried in Centennial Park Cemetery, and was survived by his wife, Edith, and six children: five sons and a daughter. His son Geoffrey was originally a mounted policeman then a detective, was a lieutenant colonel and twice mentioned in despatches during World War II, later became a police inspector, and was deputy commissioner from 1959 to 1972. His namesake son, known as Lionel, became a detective sergeant. Another son, Benjamin, was a warrant officer during World War II, and survived being a prisoner-of-war of the Japanese.|$|E
