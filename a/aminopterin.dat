25|$|In 1947, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} led by Sidney Farber showed <b>aminopterin,</b> a chemical analogue of folic acid developed by Yellapragada Subbarao of Lederle, could induce remission in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The development of folic acid analogues had been prompted by the discovery that the administration of folic acid worsened leukemia, and that a diet deficient in folic acid could, conversely, produce improvement; the mechanism of action behind these effects was still unknown at the time. Other analogues of folic acid were in development, and by 1950, methotrexate (then known as amethopterin) was being proposed as a treatment for leukemia. Animal studies published in 1956 showed the therapeutic index of methotrexate was better than that of <b>aminopterin,</b> and clinical use of <b>aminopterin</b> was thus abandoned in favor of methotrexate.|$|E
25|$|By 1900 leukemia {{was viewed}} as a family of {{diseases}} as opposed to a single disease. By 1947 Boston pathologist Sidney Farber believed from past experiments that <b>aminopterin,</b> a folic acid mimic, could potentially cure leukemia in children. The majority of the children with ALL who were tested showed signs of improvement in their bone marrow, but none of them were actually cured. This, however, led to further experiments.|$|E
25|$|The {{selective}} {{culture medium}} is called HAT medium {{because it contains}} hypoxanthine, <b>aminopterin</b> and thymidine. This medium is selective for fused (hybridoma) cells. Unfused myeloma cells cannot grow because they lack HGPRT and thus cannot replicate their DNA. Unfused spleen cells cannot grow indefinitely because of their limited life span. Only fused hybrid cells, referred to as hybridomas, are able to grow indefinitely in the media because the spleen cell partner supplies HGPRT and the myeloma partner has traits that make it immortal (similar to a cancer cell).|$|E
25|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{are typically}} made by cell culture that involves fusing myeloma cells with mouse spleen cells immunized with the desired antigen. Rabbit B-cells {{can be used}} to form a rabbit hybridoma. Polyethylene glycol is used to fuse adjacent plasma membranes, but the success rate is low, so a selective medium in which only fused cells can grow is used. This is possible because myeloma cells have lost the ability to synthesize hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT), an enzyme necessary for the salvage synthesis of nucleic acids. The absence of HGPRT is not a problem for these cells unless the de novo purine synthesis pathway is also disrupted. Exposing cells to <b>aminopterin</b> (a folic acid analogue, which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, DHFR), makes them unable to use the de novo pathway and become fully auxotrophic for nucleic acids, thus requiring supplementation to survive.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after World War II, {{a second}} {{approach}} to drug therapy of cancer began. Sidney Farber, a pathologist at Harvard Medical School, studied {{the effects of}} folic acid on leukemia patients. Folic acid, a vitamin crucial for DNA metabolism (he {{did not know the}} significance of DNA at that time), had been discovered by Lucy Wills, when she was working in India, in 1937. It seemed to stimulate the proliferation of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells when administered to children with this cancer. In one of the first examples of rational drug design (rather than accidental discovery), Farber used folate analogues synthesized by Harriett Kilte and Yellapragada Subbarow of Lederle Laboratories. These analogues — first <b>aminopterin</b> and then amethopterin (now methotrexate) were antagonistic to folic acid, and blocked the function of folate-requiring enzymes. When administered to children with ALL in 1948, these agents became the first drugs to induce remission in children with ALL. Remissions were brief, but the principle was clear — antifolates could suppress proliferation of malignant cells, and could thereby re-establish normal bone-marrow function. Farber met resistance to conducting his studies {{at a time when the}} commonly held medical belief was that leukemia was incurable, and that the children should be allowed to die in peace. Afterwards, Farber's 1948 report in the New England Journal of Medicine was met with incredulity and ridicule.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, a Dr. Meadow {{encountered}} six {{babies with}} cleft lip and palate {{in addition to}} other congenital abnormalities whose mothers had been taking anticonvulsants. Meadow wrote a letter in The Lancet asking for cases of cleft lip and palate in babies whose mothers had taken anticonvulsants. That same year, Milunsky, Graef, and Gaynor reported cases of cleft lip and palate associated with attempted abortion with methotrexate and <b>aminopterin,</b> which are folic acid antagonists. While it was widely accepted by 1969 that these drugs could interfere with folic acid and that folic acid supplementation might have beneficial somatic effects, it was believed that folic acid supplementation could exacerbate seizures; this included the routine supplements given to pregnant women to prevent megaloblastic anemia. By 1970, the doctor had collected thirty-two cases. Sixteen of them were born to women taking primidone. 25% of the thirty-two cases had congenital heart defects; the reported rate in cleft lip and palate was 3-5%. Meadow emphasized that there was no proof of an association, the immense value of anticonvulsants and the probably small odds of any one epileptic woman having a child with a congenital abnormality. Roman and Caratzali reported in 1971 that the offspring of mice treated with primidone had more abnormal bone metaphases than controls; this was due to chromosomal lesions. By the mid-1970s, it was obvious that this antagonistic effect of primidone was not due to the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme responsible for the reduction of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid, but rather to defective folate metabolism.|$|E
2500|$|All cytostatics {{are strong}} teratogens, {{abortion}} is usually recommended when pregnancy is found during or before chemotherapy. <b>Aminopterin,</b> a cytostatic drug with anti-folate effect, was {{used during the}} 1950s and 1960s to induce therapeutic abortions. In some cases the abortion didn´t happen, but the newborns suffered a fetal <b>aminopterin</b> syndrome consisting of growth retardation, craniosynostosis, hydrocephalus, facial dismorphities, mental retardation and/or leg defomities ...|$|E
2500|$|On 23 March, the New York State Food Laboratory {{reported}} that <b>aminopterin</b> {{was found in}} samples sent to them by Cornell. Michigan State University also investigated {{the source of the}} renal failure and made available to researchers and veterinarians pictures and photographs of affected animal kidneys [...] "demonstrating acute tubular necrosis in the kidney with intratubular crystals." [...] <b>Aminopterin</b> was widely described in news reports as a [...] "rat poison", though that assertion may be based upon a hypothetical use listed in the 1951 patent application and not upon the actual use of the chemical.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Sidney Farber {{received}} the Lasker in 1966 for his 1947 discovery {{that a combination}} of <b>aminopterin</b> and methotrexate, both folic acid antagonists, could produce remission in patients with acute leukemia, and for [...] "his constant leadership in the search for chemical agents against cancer".|$|E
2500|$|... 1947: Dr. Sidney Farber, {{pediatric}} pathologist, requested Dr. Yellapragada Subbarow (of Lederle lab and {{his friend}} and colleague at Harvard Medical School) to supply <b>Aminopterin</b> and later Amithopterin (Methotrexate) to conduct trials on acute leukemic children. He achieves the world's first partial remission of acute leukemia. He went on to co-found the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in 1950.|$|E
2500|$|Researchers {{have focused}} on the role of {{melamine}} and related compounds in causing renal failure. Beginning on 19 April, [...] researchers reportedly had ruled out <b>aminopterin</b> contamination and had found a [...] "spoke-like crystal" [...] in contaminated wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate and the tissues and urine of affected animals. (It was previously known that melamine and cyanuric acid can form networks of hydrogen bonds, creating a tile-like planar structure through molecular self-assembly.) The crystal has been said to serve as a biomarker for contamination and is approximately 30% melamine. The remainder has been identified as cyanuric acid, ammelide and ammeline, with crystals recovered from urine reported to be approximately 70% cyanuric acid. While some researchers have theorized the three latter chemicals might have been formed as the animals metabolized the melamine, or as byproducts of bacterial metabolism (cyanuric acid is a known intermediate byproduct of bacterial metabolism of melamine), their presence in the crystals found in contaminated protein itself, combined with media reports of widespread adulteration with both melamine and cyanuric acid in China, has focused research efforts on their combined effects in animals. Neither melamine nor cyanuric acid, a chemical commonly used in pool chlorination, have been thought to be particularly toxic by themselves. The current hypothesis is, although these contaminants are not very toxic individually, their potency appears to be increased when they are present together.|$|E
2500|$|Hybridomas are cells {{obtained}} by fusing tumor cells (which can divide infinitely) and immunoglobulin-producing lymphocytes (plasma cells). Hybridomas can {{be expanded to}} produce large quantities of immunoglobulins with a given unique specificity (monoclonal antibodies). One problem is to single out the hybridomas from the large excess of unfused cells after the cell fusion. One common way to solve this is to use thymidine kinase negative (TK−) tumor cell lines for the fusion. The thymidine kinase negative cells are {{obtained by}} growing the tumor cell line {{in the presence of}} thymidine analogs, that kill the thymidine kinase positive (TK+) cells. The negative cells can then be expanded and used for the fusion with TK+ plasma cells. After fusion, the cells are grown in a medium with methotrexate or <b>aminopterin</b> that inhibit the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase thus blocking the de novo synthesis of thymidine monophosphate. One such medium that is commonly used is HAT medium, which contains hypoxanthine, aminopterinand thymidine. The unfused cells from the thymidine kinase-deficient cell line die because they have no source of thymidine monophosphate. The lymphocytes eventually die because they are not [...] "immortal." [...] Only the hybridomas that have [...] "immortality" [...] from their cell line ancestor and thymidine kinase from the plasma cell survive. Those that produce the desired antibody are then selected and cultured to produce the monoclonal antibody. Hybridoma cells can also be isolated using the same principle as described with respect to another gene the HGPRT, which synthesizes IMP necessary for GMP nucleotide synthesis in the salvage pathway.|$|E
50|$|The vitamin {{folic acid}} is an {{oxidized}} precursor to reduced folates that is upstream of the blockade at dihydrofolate reductase, and compared to leucovrin {{is recognized as}} a very weak antidote to the toxic effects of antifolates that is inappropriate for use in cases of acute intoxication. Minnich et al. dosed mongrel dogs subcutaneously with <b>aminopterin</b> and folic acid simultaneously to test whether folic acid can rescue animals from the lethality and toxicity of <b>aminopterin</b> Dogs were given 0.020, 0.046, 0.044 escalated to 0.088, and 0.097 mg/kg <b>aminopterin</b> each day for 7 to 12 days. Folic acid was given in a weight ratio to <b>aminopterin</b> of 200:1 to 800:1. All animals survived. In contrast, animals given <b>aminopterin</b> in an amount of 0.041 mg/kg/day x 6 days without folic acid died. Thus, when the ratio of folic acid to <b>aminopterin</b> was 200:1 and greater, all of the subjects survived on regimens that would have otherwise been uniformly fatal to all subjects.|$|E
50|$|Supralethal {{doses of}} <b>aminopterin</b> may be rescued with the {{antidote}} Leucovorin (also known as folinic acid), a reduced form of folic acid which bypasses dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme inhibited by <b>aminopterin.</b> Leucovorin {{has been used}} in rats, dogs and humans to rescue <b>aminopterin</b> toxicity. Leucovorin rescue is a therapeutic maneuver intentionally employed with antifolates to achieve tumoricidal drug concentrations that would otherwise be lethal to the patient.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aminopterin</b> (or 4-aminopteroic acid), the 4-amino {{derivative}} of folic acid, is an antineoplastic drug with immunosuppressive properties {{often used in}} chemotherapy. <b>Aminopterin</b> is a synthetic {{derivative of}} pterin. <b>Aminopterin</b> works as an enzyme inhibitor by competing for the folate binding site of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. Its binding affinity for dihydrofolate reductase effectively blocks tetrahydrofolate synthesis. This results in the depletion of nucleotide precursors and inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis.|$|E
50|$|The HAT {{medium is}} one of the several {{selective}} media used for the selection of hybrid cells. This medium is supplemented with hypoxanthine, <b>aminopterin</b> and thymidine, hence the name HAT medium. Antimetabolite <b>aminopterin</b> blocks the cellular biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines from simple sugars and amino acids.|$|E
5000|$|All cytostatics {{are strong}} teratogens, {{abortion}} is usually recommended when pregnancy is found during or before chemotherapy. <b>Aminopterin,</b> a cytostatic drug with anti-folate effect, was {{used during the}} 1950s and 1960s to induce therapeutic abortions.

5000|$|The {{compound}} was explored as an abortifacient in the 1960s and earlier, but {{was associated}} with congenital malformations. [...] Similar congenital abnormalities have been documented with methotrexate, and collectively their teratogenic effects have {{become known as the}} fetal <b>aminopterin</b> syndrome. When a similar cluster of abnormalies appears in the absence of exposure to antifolates it is referred to as aminopterin-like syndrome without <b>aminopterin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The use of <b>aminopterin</b> {{in cancer}} {{treatment}} was supplanted in the 1950s by methotrexate {{due to the}} latter's better therapeutic index in a rodent tumor model. [...] Now in a more pure preparation and supported by laboratory evidence of superior tumor cell uptake in vitro, <b>aminopterin</b> is being investigated in clinical trials in leukemia as a potentially superior antifolate to methotrexate.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the use of}} <b>aminopterin</b> as a {{rodenticide}} {{is widely}} asserted on the web and elsewhere, {{there is no evidence}} that it has ever been used for that purpose either in the United States or elsewhere in the world. [...] The preparation of the molecule is complex and expensive. It is also unstable in the environment due to degradation by light and heat. The apparently mistaken association of <b>aminopterin</b> with its use as a rodenticide likely dates back to a 1951 patent issued to the American Cyanamid Company (then the holding company of Lederle Laboratories) that is commonly cited by a variety of reference textbooks. [...] <b>Aminopterin</b> has a single-dose LDLo of 2.5 mg/kg when orally administered to rats.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{effects have}} been noted in rodent species as well, where the range for rescue by folic acid was fairly narrow and highly {{dependent}} on the timing (optimal of 1 hour prior to <b>aminopterin)</b> of administration in relation to <b>aminopterin.</b> The temporal relationship between folic acid administration and rescue has been interpreted as the necessary period of time required for the vitamin to be converted in vivo to reduced forms.|$|E
5000|$|On March 23, 2007, ABC News {{reported}} that <b>aminopterin</b> was the chemical {{linked to the}} 2007 Menu Foods pet food contamination incident. The incident resulted in a massive recall of the affected foods. [...] The link to <b>aminopterin</b> was confirmed by New York State Agriculture Commissioner Patrick Hooker and Dr. Donald Smith, Dean of Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine, {{in a statement released}} on the same day.|$|E

5000|$|Discovered by Dr. Yellapragada Subbarow, {{the drug}} was first used by Sidney Farber in 1947 to induce remissions among {{children}} with leukemia. [...] <b>Aminopterin</b> was later marketed by Lederle Laboratories (Pearl River, New York) in the United States from 1953 to 1964 for the indication of pediatric leukemia. The closely related antifolate methotrexate was simultaneously marketed by the company during the same period. <b>Aminopterin</b> was discontinued by Lederle Laboratories in favor of methotrexate due to manufacturing difficulties of the former.|$|E
50|$|As his {{condition}} improved, Pinkel {{began working with}} eminent researcher Sidney Farber in Boston, experimenting with <b>aminopterin,</b> which could induce temporary remissions in some leukemia cases.|$|E
50|$|During {{the period}} <b>Aminopterin</b> was marketed, the agent was used off-label to safely treat over 4,000 {{patients}} with psoriasis in the United States, producing dramatic clearing of lesions.|$|E
5000|$|HAT Medium (hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine medium) is a {{selection}} medium for mammalian cell culture, which {{relies on the}} combination of <b>aminopterin,</b> a drug {{that acts as a}} powerful folate metabolism inhibitor by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, with hypoxanthine (a purine derivative) and thymidine (a deoxynucleoside) which are intermediates in DNA synthesis. The trick is that <b>aminopterin</b> blocks DNA de novo synthesis, which is absolutely required for cell division to proceed, but hypoxanthine and thymidine provide cells with the raw material to evade the blockage (the [...] "salvage pathway"), provided that they have the right enzymes, which means having functioning copies of the genes that encode them.|$|E
5000|$|Massive <b>aminopterin</b> {{overdosage}} {{in humans}} (i.e. > 40 mg AMT {{in an average}} 70 kg adult), should be approached with an initial leucovorin dose of 100 mg (50 mg/m2), given intravenously and continued at 6 hour intervals until the hematological abnormalities are improved (likely 8-12 courses or more). Additionally, to prevent reversible aminopterin-mediated nephrotoxicity manifesting as increases in serum creatinine and which further delays drug elimination, urinary alkalinization with [...] and volume expansion {{should be considered in}} cases of massive <b>aminopterin</b> overdosage, particularly those involving greater than 100 mg AMT in an average 70 kg adult human.|$|E
5000|$|Yellapragada Subbarow, {{known for}} the {{synthesis}} of the first ever chemotherapeutic drug <b>aminopterin,</b> and subsequently methotrexate. He is also {{known for the}} synthesis of folic acid and diethylcarbamazine and the purification of adenosine triphosphate and creatine.|$|E
50|$|The enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which {{produces}} tetrahydrofolate (THF) by {{the reduction of}} dihydrofolate, is specifically blocked by <b>aminopterin.</b> THF, acting in association with specific proteins, can receive single carbon units that are then transferred to specific targets.|$|E
50|$|Consistent {{with the}} known {{enterohepatic}} cycling of the related antifolate methotrexate, oral activated charcoal, and saline cathartic or sorbitol may promote excretion if {{an overdose of}} <b>aminopterin</b> is suspected. However, rescue with leucovorin should form the backbone of treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Sidney Farber {{received}} the Lasker in 1966 for his 1947 discovery {{that a combination}} of <b>aminopterin</b> and methotrexate, both folic acid antagonists, could produce remission in patients with acute leukemia, and for [...] "his constant leadership in the search for chemical agents against cancer".|$|E
50|$|During the S {{phase of}} cell cycle, DNA {{synthesis}} can be inhibited by using inhibitors such as thymidine, <b>aminopterin,</b> hydroxyurea and cytosine arabinoside. The {{effects of these}} inhibitors are variable for this. The cell cycle is predominantly blocked in S phase that results in viable cells.|$|E
50|$|On a HAT medium, {{only those}} cells that have active HGPRT (HGPRT+) and TK (TK+) enzymes can proliferate, while those {{deficient}} in these enzymes (HGPRr- and/or TK-) can not divide (since they cannot produce purines and pyrimidines {{due to the}} <b>aminopterin</b> present in the HAT medium).|$|E
5000|$|On March 27, the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center {{expressed}} concern that the problem may not yet be fully understood and that other contaminants may be involved, noting that [...] "clinical signs reported in cats affected by the contaminated foods are not fully consistent with the ingestion of rat poison containing aminopterin". On March 30 it was widely reported that the United States Food and Drug Administration had found melamine in wheat gluten that was used in the pet foods in question. These same reports stated that the FDA had failed to find evidence of <b>aminopterin</b> in the wheat gluten. Tests at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada detected <b>aminopterin</b> in some pet food samples, but only in concentrations of parts per billion or parts per trillion, amounts too low to cause the symptoms seen.|$|E
