25|$|Justice White {{concluded}} that {{nothing in the}} record showed that the United States intended to withdraw the riparian water rights of the landholders when it built Water Street and cut the landholders off from the Potomac River. White also engaged in a lengthy discussion of the laying out of the city's boundaries, and the conveyance of private property to the federal government. There could be no doubt, White argued, that the private landowners intended to give all of their riparian rights to the federal government, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{no doubt that the}} federal government intended to give all riparian rights to those to whom it sold the land. The majority's argument led to a tautology in which no riparian rights existed.|$|E
25|$|BorisI's {{successor}} SimeonI was {{not content}} to have the Bulgarian Church with the rank of archbishopric and was determined to raise it to a patriarchate, {{in light of his}} own ambition to become an emperor. He was well acquainted with the Byzantine imperial tradition that the autocrat must have a patriarch <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> no empire without a patriarchate. In the aftermath of his remarkable triumph over the Byzantines in the battle of Achelous, in 918 he convened a council and elevated the archbishop Leontius as a patriarch. The decisions of that council were not recognized by the Byzantines but {{as a result of the}} Bulgarian victory in the war they eventually recognized Leontius' successor Demetrius as Patriarch of Bulgaria in 927. It was the first Patriarchate officially accepted, apart from the ancient Pentarchy. It is likely that the seat of the Patriarchate was in the city of Drastar on the Danube River rather than in the capital Preslav. In the late 10th century the Bulgarian Patriarchate included the following dioceses: Ohrid, Kostur, Glavinitsa (in modern southern Albania), Maglen, Pelagonia, Strumitsa, Morovizd (in modern northern Greece), Velbazhd, Serdica, Braničevo, Niš, Belgrade, Srem, Skopje, Prizren, Lipljan, Servia, Drastar, Voden, Ras, Chernik, Himara, Drinopol, Butrint, Yanina, Petra and Stag.|$|E
500|$|Sotomayor {{cast her}} first vote as an {{associate}} Supreme Court justice on August 17, 2009, in a stay of execution case. She was given a warm welcome onto the Court and was formally invested in a September 8 ceremony. Sotomayor's inaugural case in which she heard arguments was on September 9 during a special session, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. It involved the controversial aspect of the First Amendment {{and the rights of}} corporations in campaign finance; Sotomayor dissented. In her vigorous examination of Floyd Abrams, representing the First Amendment issues in the case, Sotomayor challenged him, questioning 19th century rulings of the Court and saying, [...] "What you are suggesting is that the courts, who created corporations as persons, gave birth to corporations as persons, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> an argument made that that was the Court's error to start with ... a creature of State law with human characteristics." ...|$|E

The Hungarian language was overrepresented in the primary schools and almost all secondary education was in Hungarian.|$|E

[...] In the same year he added the appendix of Shelley's letters <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> no question of the extreme value of this.

2500|$|Frashokereti is the Zoroastrian {{doctrine}} {{of a final}} renovation of the universe, when evil will be destroyed, and everything else will be then in perfect unity with God (Ahura Mazda). The doctrinal premises are (1) good will eventually prevail over evil; (2) creation was initially perfectly good, but was subsequently corrupted by evil; (3) the world will ultimately be restored to the perfection it {{had at the time}} of creation; (4) the [...] "salvation for the individual depended on the sum of [...] thoughts, words and deeds, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> no intervention, whether compassionate or capricious, by any divine being to alter this."

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2011, {{regulations}} were changed to allow for wearing of sew-on embroidered skill badges like the ones worn on the older BDUs. The 5-badge limit remained in effect, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> no mixing of sew-on and pin-on badges. At the same time, the US Army nametape, personal nametapes, and rank insignia could be sewn-on at the wearers preference. Skill tabs, such as the President's Hundred Tab, Special Forces, Ranger, and Sapper are worn on the left sleeve pocket flap, and are subject to a 3-tab-only rule. A tab that {{is an integral part}} of a unit patch, such as the [...] "Mountain" [...] or [...] "Airborne" [...] tab, is not counted against the rule. The U.S. Army Chaplain insignia is the only authorized branch insignia to be worn on the ACU. It is centered 1/8inch above the right name tape. The insignia may be the metal pin-on variety or the black embroidered insignia on digitized fabric with Velcro fasteners.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{afterward}} I {{resolved to}} visit my town of Taal; nothing was left of it except {{the walls of the}} church and convento.

I went down to the river and found it completely filled up, with a boat belonging to the alcalde and many of private persons buried in the mud. After incredible efforts I finally succeeded in unearthing in what had once been the church and sacristy, the chests which contained the sacred vestments and vessels. Nearly all of them were demolished by the rocks and beams which had fallen upon them, and filled with foul-smelling mud that had ruined or disfigured their contents. With the aid of some natives of Bauang, I likewise recovered some property from among the ruins of the convento.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the lead}} up to the Battle of Northampton, the Earls of Warwick and March sent envoys to negotiate, but Buckingham, backed in his {{position}} by his son-in-law, the Earl of Shrewsbury and Lords Beaumont and Egremont, was no longer conciliatory. Buckingham was once again acting as representative of the King and did not allow the Yorkists' envoys to meet Henry. The duke informed them '"the Earl of Warwick shall {{not come to the}} King's presence and if he comes he shall die," [...] and told a group of Yorkist bishops that they were not men of peace, but men of war, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> no peace with Warwick. It is likely that a personal animosity pre-existed between the two men by this time– possibly as a result of Warwick's previous rent evasion, and that Buckingham's influential voice was used to vote for action in the King's camp. The duke may also have misinterpreted the Yorkists' requests to negotiate as a sign of weakness. It is possible that Buckingham saw the coming battle as an opportunity to settle scores with Warwick (rather than with the Duke of York). If this was so, says Rawcliffe, then these plans [...] "ended abruptly" [...] on the battlefield. Not only this, but Buckingham may also have misjudged the size of the Yorkist army as well the royal soldiers' loyalty.|$|E
