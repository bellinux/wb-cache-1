5000|$|Theta-frequency {{activity}} {{arising from}} the hippocampus is manifested during some short-term memory tasks (Vertes, 2005).

Conversely, theta oscillations have been correlated to various voluntary behaviors (exploration, spatial navigation, etc.) and <b>alert</b> <b>states</b> (goose bumps, etc.) in rats (Vanderwolf, 1969), suggesting that it may reflect the integration of sensory information with motor output (for review, see Bland & Oddie, 2001). A large body of evidence indicates that theta rhythm is likely involved in spatial learning and navigation (Buzsáki, 2005).|$|R

50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a first strike is contingent upon the aggressor's ability to immediately deplete its enemy's retaliatory capacity to a level {{that would make a}} second strike impossible, mitigable, or strategically undesirable. Intelligence and early warning systems increase the probability that the enemy will have the time to launch its own strike before its warmaking capacity has been significantly reduced, thus rendering a first strike pointless. <b>Alert</b> <b>states</b> such as DEFCON conditions, apart from serving a purpose in the internal management of a country's military, can have the effect of advising a potential aggressor that an escalation towards first strike has been detected, and therefore that effective retaliatory strikes could be made {{in the event of an}} attack.|$|R
