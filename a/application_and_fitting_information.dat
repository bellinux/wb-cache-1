40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} two decades, much effort {{has been devoted to}} {{accurately}} measure Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDFs) of real-world materials and to use efficiently the resulting data for rendering. Because of their large size, it is difficult to use directly measured BRDFs for real-time <b>applications,</b> <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> the most sophisticated analytical BRDF models is still a complex task. In this paper, we introduce Rational BRDF, a general-purpose and efficient representation for arbitrary BRDFs, based on Rational Functions (RFs). Using an adapted parametrization we demonstrate how Rational BRDFs offer (1) a more compact and efficient representation using low-degree RFs, (2) an accurate fitting of measured materials with guaranteed control of the residual error, and (3) an efficient importance sampling by applying the same fitting process to determine the inverse of the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) generated from the BRDF for use in Monte-Carlo rendering...|$|R

40|$|A {{hallmark}} of the adaptive immune response is the proliferation of pathogen-specific lymphocytes that leave in their wake a long lived population of cells that provide lasting immunity. A subject of debate is at which time point post infection those memory cells are produced during an adaptive immune response. In two ground-breaking studies, [Buchholz et al., 2013] and [Gerlach et al., 2013] introduced a new experimental method {{that allowed them to}} determine the number offspring from individual lymphocytes in vivo at a single harvesting time point. Through the development, <b>application</b> <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> of a mathematical model, the authors of [Buchholz et al., 2013] concluded that memory cell precursors are produced before the effector cells that clear the original pathogen, contrary to prior understanding. Cohort level cell data in the paper [Kinjyo et al., 2015], however, challenges that deduction. In this thesis we sought to quantitatively reconcile these two reports by adopting the mathematical methodology of [Buchholz et al., 2013] to make it suitable for drawing inferences from the data in [Badovinac et al., 2007], [Schlub et al., 2010] and [Kinjyo et al., 2015]. When <b>fitting</b> to spleen <b>and</b> blood data reported in these papers, under the assumptions of the model, our conclusion is consistent with [Buchholz et al., 2013]: memory precursor cells appear before effector cells. However, an alternative possibility supported by the data in [Kinjyo et al., 2015] is that memory is created after the expansion phase, a deduction not possible from the data or mathematical methods in [Buchholz et al., 2013]...|$|R
40|$|Research on cooperatively {{breeding}} {{species has}} shown that their population dynamics {{differ from those of}} conventional breeders. Populations of cooperators are structured into groups, and group-level Allee effects are likely common. We assess the ability of phenomenological models, lacking explicit group structure, to describe population dynamics in cooperative meerkats Suricata suricatta, and we assess potential Allee effects at the population level. Using maximum likelihood model <b>fitting</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> theoretic model selection, applied to time series data from a wild meerkat population, we find simple models that incorporate rainfall and conventional density dependence to be the most parsimonious of the models considered. Detecting no population-level Allee effect, we conclude that explicit consideration of population structure will be key to understanding the mechanisms behind population dynamics in cooperatively breeding species. © 2011 The Authors...|$|R

40|$|We tackle an {{important}} although rarely addressed question of accounting {{for a variety}} of asymmetries frequently observed in stochastic temporal/spatial records. First, we review some measures intending to capture such asymmetries that have been introduced on various occasions in the past and then propose a family of measures that is motivated by Rice's formula for crossing level distributions of the slope. We utilize those asymmetry measures to demonstrate how a class of second-order models built on the skewed Laplace distributions can account for sample path asymmetries. It is shown that these models are capable of mimicking not only distributional skewness but also more complex geometrical asymmetries in the sample path such as tilting, front-back slope asymmetry and time irreversibility. Simple moment-based estimation techniques are briefly discussed to allow direct <b>application</b> to modelling <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> actual records...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{describes a}} simulation of the DEPFET pixel semiconductor detector. The DEPFET detector {{is a key}} part of a newly constructed Belle II particle detector being built in KEK, Japan. The simulation is made as a package for the basf 2 framework, developed for the Belle II experiment. The goal of this thesis was to learn about the Belle II experiment, DEPFET pixel detector and the basf 2 framework and to develop a simulation environment, depicting experimental setup at CERN's SPS accelerator in 2009. First part of this thesis describes the Belle II detector, the basf 2 framework and summarizes basic information about silicon particle detectors, especially about the DEPFET technology. A task for the analysis of the data is to evaluate residuals after particle track <b>fitting</b> <b>and</b> cluster <b>information</b> in the pixel detector.

A viable solution, already successfully applied at optical wavelengths, is to use an empirical iron emission template.

Their <b>application</b> allows <b>fitting</b> <b>and</b> subtraction of the iron emission in active galaxy spectra.
