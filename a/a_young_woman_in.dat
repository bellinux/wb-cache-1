Javed, a Punjabi Muslim womaniser with a talent for reciting poetry, meets Aradhana, <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> the village, while being chased by the police.

During the vows, Javed realises Aradhana is wearing a widow's clothes and stops the wedding, insisting on marrying Aradhana.|$|E
5|$|There {{was nothing}} to link Murat or his friends to the disappearance, and Murat's arguido status was lifted on 21 July 2008 when the case was archived. In April 2008 he {{received}} £600,000 in out-of-court settlements for libel in what The Observer said was {{the largest number of}} separate libel actions brought in the UK by the same person in relation to one issue; his friends received £100,000 each. In July 2014, during Operation Grange, one of those friends was questioned again as a witness, this time by the Polícia Judiciária on behalf of Scotland Yard. In December that year Murat and his wife were questioned, also on behalf of Scotland Yard, along with eight others. In 2017 Murat's mother, Jenny Murat, added her voice to those who had witnessed suspicious events around 5A that night: she told the BBC that she had driven past apartment 5A that night, and had seen <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> a plum-coloured top behaving suspiciously just outside it, information she said she passed to the police at the time.

It included drawings and photographs using professional bondage models in bondage or sadomasochistic scenes. Sweet Gwendoline was the main female character in his works, published largely in the 1950s and 60's, and possibly the most famous bondage icon after Bettie Page. She was repeatedly depicted as the stereotypical naïve blonde damsel in distress.|$|E

In 385, Augustine ended his relationship with his lover in order to prepare himself to marry a ten-year-old heiress.

25|$|Less {{than two}} months after the murder of Dawn Basom, on June 9, three teenage boys {{discovered}} a partially nude body of <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> a field close to an abandoned farmhouse on North Territorial Road. The victim had received multiple slash and stab wounds to the body (including two stab wounds which had pierced her heart), and a gunshot wound to the forehead before her neck had been cut through to the spine. The victim's right thumb had also received a gunshot wound, suggesting the woman had instinctively raised her hand to protect herself before her killer had fired the gun at point-blank range. She had also been raped, although the pathologist was unable to determine whether this act had occurred before or after death. Sections of her clothing were scattered around her body, although one of her shoes was missing.|$|E
25|$|During {{her early}} period she {{reported}} night time visitations by an apparition of Hor-Ra. He slowly dictated to her, over a twelve-month period, {{the story of}} her previous life. The story took up around seventy pages of cursive hieroglyphic text. It described the life of <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> ancient Egypt, called Bentreshyt, who had reincarnated in the person of Dorothy Eady. Bentreshyt ("Harp of Joy") is described in this text as being of humble origin, her mother a vegetable seller and her father a soldier during the reign of Seti I (c.1290 BC to 1279 BC). When she was three, her mother died, and she was placed in the temple of Kom el-Sultan because her father couldn't afford her. There, she was brought up to be a priestess. When she was twelve years old the High Priest asked her if she wished {{to go out into the}} world or stay and become a consecrated virgin. In the absence of full understanding and without a practical alternative, she took the vows.|$|E
25|$|The {{staircase}} {{is followed}} by the Norman Porch, a square landing distinguished by its central clustered column and the intricate ceiling it supports, which is made up of four groin vaults with lierne ribs and carved bosses. The Porch was named for its proposed decorative scheme, based on Norman history. In the event, neither the planned statues of Norman kings nor the frescoes were executed, and only the stained-glass window portraying Edward the Confessor hints at this theme. Queen Victoria is depicted twice in the room: as <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> the other stained-glass window, and near the end of her life, sitting on the throne of the House of Lords, in a copy of a 1900 painting by Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant which hangs on the eastern wall. The sixteen plinths intended for the statues now house busts of prime ministers who have sat in the House of Lords, such as the Earl Grey and the Marquess of Salisbury. A double door opposite the stairs leads to the Royal Gallery, and another to the right opens to the Robing Room.|$|E

25|$|Partial DNA matches are not {{searches}} themselves, but are {{the result}} of moderate stringency CODIS searches that produce a potential match that shares at least one allele at every locus. Partial matching does not involve the use of familial search software, such as those used in the UK and United States, or additional Y-STR analysis, and therefore often misses sibling relationships. Partial matching has been used to identify suspects in several cases in the UK and United States, and has also been used as a tool to exonerate the falsely accused. Darryl Hunt was wrongly convicted in connection with the rape and murder of <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> 1984 in North Carolina. Hunt was exonerated in 2004 when a DNA database search produced a remarkably close match between a convicted felon and the forensic profile from the case. The partial match led investigators to the felon’s brother, Willard E. Brown, who confessed to the crime when confronted by police. A judge then signed an order to dismiss the case against Hunt.|$|E

Meanwhile, September Mourning, a November 1915 release produced by L-KO, portrayed a pair of artists first vying for the attentions of <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> the park, then invading a school for girls. Robert McElravy, reviewing for Moving Picture World, found the film funny, but considered it to lack plot.
