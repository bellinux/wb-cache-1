5|$|Hygeberht's {{contemporary}} at Canterbury, Æthelhard, was {{the first}} Archbishop of Canterbury to require <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> <b>of</b> faith from his subordinate bishops when they were elected. The historian Eric John argues that this custom began because {{of the creation of}} the archbishopric of Lichfield.|$|E
5|$|Burton {{points out}} that many {{conservative}} critics and magazines (John Simon, James Bowman, the World Report) initially either criticized the film or praised it only for its non-political elements. Only after {{the popularity of the}} film was well-established did conservatives embrace the film as <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> <b>of</b> traditional values. Burton implies the liberal-left could have prevented the conservatives from claiming rights to the film, had it chosen to vocalize elements of the film such as its criticism of military values. Instead, the liberal-left focused on what the film omitted, such as the feminist and civil rights movements.|$|E

He joined the French Communist Party the next day as <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> <b>of</b> his personal faith in the Soviet Union. Marianne rejoined him in Paris on 6 September 1939, three days after the British and French declaration of war on Germany in response to the German invasion of Poland that started the Second World War in Europe. They were married on 9 January 1940.|$|E

5|$|The {{individual}} {{regions of}} the North have had their own identities and cultures for centuries, but with industrialisation, mass media {{and the opening of}} the North–South divide, a common Northern identity began to develop. This identity was initially a reactionary response to Southern prejudices – the North of the nineteenth century was largely depicted as a dirty, wild and uncultured place, even in sympathetic depictions such as Elizabeth Gaskell's 1855 novel North and South – but became <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> <b>of</b> what Northerners saw as their own personal strengths. Traits stereotypically associated with Northern England are straight-talking, grit and warmheartedness, as compared to the supposedly effete Southerners. Northern England – especially Lancashire, but also Yorkshire and the North East – has a tradition of matriarchal families, where the woman of the house runs the home and controls the family's finances. This too has its roots in industrialisation, when mills offered well-paid work for women: during depressions when demand for coal and steel were low, women were often the main breadwinners. Northern women are still stereotyped as strong-willed and independent, or affectionately as battle-axes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the preface}} to the Groundwork Kant motivates the need for pure moral {{philosophy}} and makes some preliminary remarks to situate his project and explain his method of investigation.

25|$|Leibniz {{was first}} {{introduced}} to the I Ching through his contact with the French Jesuit Joachim Bouvet, who visited China in 1685 as a missionary. Leibniz saw the I Ching hexagrams as <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> <b>of</b> the universality of his own religious beliefs as a Christian. Binary numerals were central to Leibniz's theology.

25|$|Schopenhauer {{discusses}} suicide at length, {{noting that}} it does not actually destroy the Will or any part of it in any substantial way, since death is merely the end of one particular phenomenon of the Will, which is subsequently rearranged.

The depiction of the nocturnal and predatory owls, however, have led many to believe the relief is <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> <b>of</b> Lilith’s role as a demon who flies about the underworld, delivering night terrors to those who sleep.|$|E

25|$|In {{connection}} with healthcare philosophy, {{the theory of}} natural rights becomes a rather pertinent subject. After birth, man is effectively endowed {{with a series of}} natural rights that cannot be banished under any circumstances. One major proponent of natural rights theory was seventeenth-century English political philosopher John Locke. With regard to the natural rights of man, Locke states, Although partially informed by his religious understanding of the world, Locke's statement can essentially be viewed as <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> <b>of</b> the right to preserve one's life at all costs. This point is precisely where healthcare as a human right becomes relevant.|$|E
25|$|Afrocentrism {{can be seen}} as an African-American-inspired {{ideology}} that manifests <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> <b>of</b> themselves in a Eurocentric-dominated society, commonly by conceptualizing a glorified heritage in terms of distinctly African, foreign origins (where foreign is anything not indigenous to the African continent). It often denies or minimizes European, Near Eastern and Asian cultural influences while accenting historical African civilizations that independently accomplished a significant level of cultural and technological development. In general, Afrocentrism is usually manifested in a focus on African-American culture and the history of Africa. It involves an African diaspora version of an African-centered view of history and culture to portray the achievements and development of Africans who have been marginalized.|$|E
25|$|Louisiana State troopers and National Guard {{assisted}} with crowd {{control for the}} first time since 1979. Many of the floats had been partially submerged in the floodwaters for weeks. While some krewes repaired and removed all traces of these effects, others incorporated flood lines and other damage into the designs of the floats. Most of the locals who worked on the floats and rode on them were significantly impacted by the storm, and many had lost most or all of their possessions, but their enthusiasm for Carnival was even more intense than usual and celebrated as <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> <b>of</b> life. The themes of many costumes and floats had more barbed satire than usual, with commentary on the trials and tribulations of living in the devastated city, with references to MREs, Katrina refrigerators and FEMA trailers, along with much mocking of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and local and national politicians.|$|E

Situating the Cloisters {{at the heart of the}} library—it is on the second floor just south of Thompson’s central axis—was <b>a</b> deliberate <b>affirmation</b> <b>of</b> Vassar’s commitment to the importance of place in education.

500|$|... "Far East Man" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} English musicians George Harrison and Ronnie Wood, each of whom {{released}} a recording of the song in 1974. Wood's version appeared on I've Got My Own Album to Do, his debut solo album, and Harrison's on Dark Horse. Their only official songwriting collaboration, [...] "Far East Man" [...] is <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> <b>of</b> friendship {{in the face of}} life's obstacles and musically reflects the two guitarists' adoption of the soul genre. Written mostly by Harrison, the composition has been interpreted as a restatement of the humanitarian message expressed in his 1971 single [...] "Bangla Desh", and a tribute to Indian musician Ravi Shankar.|$|E
500|$|In a notably {{unfavourable}} {{review of}} the album, for Rolling Stone, Jim Miller quoted the chorus of the title track to illustrate his point that the singer's [...] "quest for illumination populates his lyrics with sermons and awkward mea culpas". Miller added that [...] "thanks to Harrison's no-voice and stilted lyrics, [...] quite fails to evoke the self-confident master of 'My Sweet Lord' or even 'Living in the Material World.'" [...] Reviewing the album for the NME, Bob Woffinden took exception to Harrison's lyrics, ridiculing [...] "Dark Horse" [...] as [...] "a putdown of Patti , <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> <b>of</b> Harrison's male chauvinism – he {{was on top of}} the game all through".|$|E

[...] Glenn Selig, founder of The Publicity Agency, responded to these claims on Fox News Live, stating, [...] "In her efforts to boycott the video, Naomi Wolf has brought more attention to it, without her comments, most people would clearly have seen the military simply as a metaphor and not as an attempt by Katy Perry to glamorize the military or war."

500|$|Benitez {{considers}} the poem {{to highlight the}} tensions between the [...] "monadic and autonomous subjectivity" [...] of European culture and the [...] "social subjectivity" [...] of adat, or tradition, with the character of Siti Akbari [...] "a site of instability that makes manifest both the possibilities of social transformation, {{as well as the}} anxiety over the possibility of social reproduction gone awry". As an individual, she is able to fight her enemies and reclaim her husband. Ultimately, however, she chooses to return to her polygamous relationship with Abdul Moelan, <b>an</b> <b>affirmation</b> <b>of</b> tradition over modernism. In opposition to Siti Akbari, the trader Safi Oedin refuses to live in accordance with the local customs while he is in a foreign land and ultimately dies. Benitez writes that this [...] "may be read as a warning to those who refuse to live in accordance with local adat." [...] Koster notes that– as usual with syairs– Siti Akbari works to increase awareness of adat and traditional value systems.|$|E
