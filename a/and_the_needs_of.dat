5|$|After {{consultation}} with Canadian Pacific Railway officials, Lieutenant Governor Edgar Dewdney {{made the decision}} to move the capital to Regina, also in present-day Saskatchewan, in June 1882. The decision to move the capital was controversial with the public because Edgar Dewdney owned real estate in Regina. He was accused of having conflicted interests between his private affairs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the government.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} January 1939, when U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a public {{statement}} calling for {{an expansion of the}} Air Corps in anticipation of the coming of World War II <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the United States in defending the Western Hemisphere, that Army policy was reversed. Gen. George C. Marshall, who was soon to move up from head of the War Plans Division to be the Army's chief of staff, received personal instruction on the capabilities and strengths of long-range bombers from new Air Corps chief Gen. Henry H. Arnold.|$|E
5|$|Botanical gardens {{have always}} {{responded to the}} {{interests}} {{and values of the}} day. If a single function were to be chosen from the early literature on botanical gardens, it would be their scientific endeavour and, flowing from this, their instructional value. In their formative years, botanical gardens were gardens for physicians and botanists, but then they progressively became more associated with ornamental horticulture <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the general public. The scientific reputation of a botanical garden is now judged by the publications coming out of herbaria and similar facilities, not by its living collections. The interest in economic plants now has less relevance, and the concern with plant classification systems has all but disappeared, while a fascination with the curious, beautiful and new seems unlikely to diminish.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930s Yeats {{was fascinated}} with the authoritarian, anti-democratic, {{nationalist}} movements of Europe, and he composed several marching songs for the far right Blueshirts, although they were never used. He was a fierce opponent of individualism and political liberalism, and saw the fascist movements as a triumph of public order <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the national collective over petty individualism. On the other hand, {{he was also an}} elitist who abhorred the idea of mob-rule, and saw democracy as a threat to good governance and public order. After the Blueshirt movement began to falter in Ireland, he distanced himself somewhat from his previous views, but maintained a preference for authoritarian and nationalist leadership.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the {{outbreak}} of the First World War the NUWSS spent its time in north Wales organising educational and propaganda campaigns. In south Wales friction was caused by a shift in political views pushed onto the country from the central office. 1912 saw the NUWSS switch its policy as a non-party organisation to set up the Election Fighting Fund (EFF) to support the newly burgeoning Labour Party. Wales had traditionally been a Liberal heartland and the South Wales Federation of Women’s Suffrage Societies was opposed to this new policy. There was a sense that there was a disjoint between the central 'English feminist agenda' pushed by the militant headquarters <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> Welsh social, cultural and political views. The strains existed between the two organisation until the EFF was abandoned in 1914.|$|E
5|$|Increasingly, {{however, the}} ice trade {{began to focus}} on {{supplying}} the growing cities on the east coast of the U.S. <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> businesses across the Midwest. The citizens of New York City and Philadelphia became huge consumers of ice during their long, hot summers, and additional ice was harvested from the Hudson River and Maine to fulfil the demand. Ice began to be used in refrigerator cars by the railroad industry, allowing the meat packing industry around Chicago and Cincinnati to slaughter cattle locally, sending dressed meat east for either the internal or overseas markets. Chilled refrigerator cars and ships created a national industry in vegetables and fruit that could previously only have been consumed locally. American and British fishermen began to preserve their catches in ice, allowing longer voyages and bigger catches, and the brewing industry became operational all-year around. As U.S. ice exports diminished after 1870, Norway became {{a major player in the}} international market, shipping large quantities of ice to England and Germany.|$|E
30|$|The {{present study}} aims at {{depicting}} <b>the</b> context <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> strengthening science-stakeholder-policy interface to achieve sustainability goals, acknowledging <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> transparent communication, of translating scientific results in comprehensible knowledge {{for a broader}} audience and in operational options for decision makers.|$|R

5|$|Noura {{worked on}} the first season of the show and was a muppeteer for {{numerous}} characters and provided the singing voice of the main character, Shams. Also served as a songwriter {{for a number of}} songs that appeared throughout the first season. A talented performer and highly-recommended professional, she delivers a curriculum targeted to individuals <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> their organizations. Noura is also a highly regarded vocal artist, working in commercial broadcast on both television and in radio. Her background is in economics (Master's Degree from La Sorbonne) while she also spent many years in career theater and arts. The combination of the two provides for the use of performance as a heightened communications medium as well as a conduit for advanced learning.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Norman was {{developed}} in the early 19th century, and along with Thoroughbred and local Norman blood, influences were seen from other breeds, including British and Russian trotting horses. By the mid-19th century, the Anglo-Norman was a popular breed throughout France, and in 1864 a breed association was founded. While often purchased by the French army and used as cavalry and artillery horses, there was controversy over whether the Anglo-Norman was the best choice for the military. The late 19th century saw significant improvements in breeding programs, although there remained a dispute between the goals of breeders <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the military. Mechanization in the early 20th century significantly reduced demand for the breed, and fighting during World War II and the German occupation of France resulted in major damage to breeding centers and the deaths of many horses. While rebuilding their herds, breeders turned away from draft and carriage horses and began breeding sport horses for equestrian competition.|$|E
5|$|The support {{given to}} Henry by the Papacy during {{his early years}} had a lasting {{influence}} on his attitude towards Rome, and he defended the mother church diligently throughout his reign. Rome in the 13th century was at once both {{the centre of the}} Europe-wide Church, and a political power in central Italy, threatened militarily by the Holy Roman Empire. During Henry's reign, the Papacy developed a strong, central bureaucracy, supported by benefices granted to absent churchmen working in Rome. Tensions grew between this practice <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> local parishioners, exemplified by the dispute between Robert Grosseteste, the Bishop of Lincoln, and the Papacy in 1250. Although the Scottish Church became more independent of England during the period, the Papal Legates helped Henry continue to apply influence over its activities at a distance. Pope Innocent IV's attempts to raise funds began to face opposition from within the English Church during Henry's reign. In 1240, the Papal emissary's collection of taxes to pay for the Papacy's war with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II resulted in protests, ultimately overcome with the help of Henry and the Pope, and in the 1250s Henry's crusading tithes faced similar resistance.|$|E
