40|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> Lehman-Brothers <b>collapse,</b> <b>the</b> {{stock index}} has {{exceeded}} its pre-Lehman-Brothers peak by 36 % in real terms. Seemingly, markets have been demanding more stocks instead of bonds. Yet, instead of observing higher bond rates, paradoxically, bond {{rates have been}} persistently negative <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Lehman-Brothers <b>collapse.</b> To explain this paradox, we suggest that, in the post-Lehman-Brothers period, investors changed their perceptions on disasters, thinking that disasters occur once every 30 years on average, instead of disasters occurring once every 60 years. In our asset-pricing calibration exercise, this rise in perceived market fragility alone can explain the drop in both bond rates and price-dividend ratios observed <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Lehman-Brothers <b>collapse,</b> which indicates that markets mostly demanded bonds instead of stocks...|$|R
