5|$|Stout, {{a kind of}} porter beer, {{particularly}} Guinness, {{is typically}} associated with Ireland, although historically it was more closely associated with London. Porter remains very popular, although it has lost sales since the mid-20th century to lager. Cider, particularly Magners (marketed in the Republic of Ireland as Bulmers), is also a popular drink. Red lemonade, a soft-drink, is consumed on its own and as <b>a</b> <b>mixer,</b> particularly with whiskey.|$|E
5|$|Another kashrut {{challenge}} {{which the}} bakery overcame {{in the early}} 1950s concerned the ability to produce fresh bread for sale on Sunday mornings after the plant had been closed for Shabbat in accordance with Jewish law. Normally dough takes four to six hours to rise, but the bakery acquired <b>a</b> <b>mixer</b> made by Tweedy of Burnley, England, which could produce dough in only two hours, thus allowing the bakery to bake bread on Saturday night in time for Sunday-morning deliveries. Today Angel Bakeries owns nine such mixers, five of which are used in its Jerusalem plant.|$|E
5|$|Frith {{recorded}} the album at David Vorhaus's Kaleidophon Studios in London on 11–13 and 15 July 1974, {{where he played}} a modified 1936 Gibson K-11. He added an extra pickup over the strings at the nut, enabling him to amplify sound {{from both sides of}} the fretted note. He then split the fretboard in two with a capo, effectively giving him two guitars, each amplified separately that he could play independently with each hand. To split the sounds further he attached alligator clips at various positions on the strings. The net result was a guitar with multiple sound sources that could be channelled to <b>a</b> <b>mixer</b> and distributed across the stereo soundscape.|$|E

25|$|It {{should also}} be noted that the {{feedback}} is not limited to a frequency divider. This element can be other elements such as a frequency multiplier, or <b>a</b> <b>mixer.</b> The multiplier will make the VCO output a sub-multiple (rather than a multiple) of the reference frequency. <b>A</b> <b>mixer</b> can translate the VCO frequency by a fixed offset. It may also be a combination of these. An example being a divider following a mixer; this allows the divider to operate at a much lower frequency than the VCO without a loss in loop gain.|$|E

25|$|In January 1985, Dahmer {{was hired}} as <b>a</b> <b>mixer</b> at the Milwaukee Ambrosia Chocolate Factory, where he worked from 11 p.m to 7 a.m. six nights a week, with Saturday evenings off. Shortly after Dahmer found this employment, an {{incident}} occurred {{in which he was}} propositioned by another man while sitting reading in the West Allis Public Library. The stranger threw Dahmer a note offering to perform fellatio upon him. Although Dahmer did not respond to this proposition, the incident stirred in his mind the fantasies of control and dominance he had developed as a teenager, and he began to familiarize himself with Milwaukee's gay bars, bookstores, and gay bathhouses. He is also known to have stolen a male mannequin from a store, which he briefly used for sexual stimulation before his grandmother, having discovered the item stowed in a closet, demanded that he discard it.|$|E
25|$|Once {{a single}} loop-based {{arrangement}} has been generated, a producer may then focus on developing how the summing of the overdubbed parts will unfold in time, {{and what the}} final structure of the piece will be. Some producers achieve this by adding or removing layers of material at appropriate points in the mix. Quite often, this is achieved by physically manipulating <b>a</b> <b>mixer,</b> sequencer, effects, dynamic processing, equalization, and filtering while recording to a multi-track device. Other producers achieve similar results by using the automation features of computer-based digital audio workstations. Techno can consist of little more than cleverly programmed rhythmic sequences and looped motifs combined with signal processing of one variety or another, frequency filtering being a commonly used process. A more idiosyncratic approach to production {{is evident in the}} music of artists such as Twerk and Autechre, where aspects of algorithmic composition are employed in the generation of material.|$|E
25|$|DJ mixers {{are small}} audio mixing {{consoles}} specialized for DJing. Most DJ mixers have far fewer channels than <b>a</b> <b>mixer</b> {{used by a}} record producer or audio engineer; whereas standard live sound mixers in small venues have 12 to 24 channels, and standard recording studio mixers have even more (as many as 72 on large boards), basic DJ mixers may have only two channels. While DJ mixers have {{many of the same}} features found on larger mixers (faders, equalization knobs, gain knobs, effects units, etc), DJ mixers have a feature that is usually only found on DJ mixers: the crossfader. The crossfader is a type of fader that is mounted horizontally. DJs used the crossfader to mix two or more sound sources. The midpoint of the crossfader's travel is a 50/50 mix of the two channels (on a two channel mixer). The far left side of the crossfader provides only the channel A sound source. The far right side provides only the channel B sound source (e.g., record player number 2). Positions in between the two extremes provide different mixes of the two channels. Some DJs use a computer with DJ software and a DJ controller instead of an analog DJ mixer to mix music, although DJ software can be used in conjunction with a hardware DJ mixer.|$|E
50|$|One {{method of}} {{reducing}} the potential for this transmitter defect {{is the use of}} balanced and double balanced <b>mixers.</b> <b>A</b> simple <b>mixer</b> will pass both of the input frequencies and all of their harmonics along with the sum and difference frequencies. If the simple mixer is replaced with <b>a</b> balanced <b>mixer</b> then the number of possible products is reduced. If the frequency mixer has fewer outputs the task of making sure that the final output is clean will be simpler.|$|R

[...] When the army holds {{maneuvers}} near her home town, the factory supervisor organizes <b>a</b> <b>mixer</b> for the largely female workforce and the all-male soldiers. [...] This dance proves a mixed success, with many of the soldiers, who are middle-aged reservists, and many of the factory workers, who are inexperienced young women with idealized views of romance, being confused by and disappointed with their potential dancing partners. The film's protagonist, though, does meet an attractive young man who plays in the dance band and has a one-night fling with him. When she travels to the capital city where he lives in order to resume their romance, she meets his parents and comes to the realization that there is no future in this relationship.|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} their twentieth anniversary concert, Score, on April 1, 2006, Dream Theater rested for {{its first}} summer in ten years. The band would reconvene at Avatar Studios, in New York City, in September 2006. Mike Portnoy stated {{that the relationship between}} band members was [...] "the best it's ever been". The band hired Paul Northfield, who had previously worked with bands that had inspired Dream Theater, including Rush and Queensrÿche, to engineer the album. As with previous albums, Dream Theater simultaneously wrote and recorded Systematic Chaos. Mike Portnoy and John Petrucci co-produced the album; Portnoy said that the band hires an engineer and <b>a</b> <b>mixer</b> to act as an [...] "objective outside ear", but the members ultimately [...] "call their own shots". Previous Dream Theater albums shared planned themes throughout, such as [...] (1999) as a concept album or Train of Thought (2003) as a heavy, [...] "balls to the wall" [...] album. Though Portnoy had some preconceived ideas for Systematic Chaos, he decided not to tell the rest of the band; leaving them to start with a [...] "completely open palate". However, Portnoy did want to retain a [...] "cutting, aggressive, modern" [...] mood throughout, [...] "It had to have balls," [...] he added, [...] "it had to be cool".|$|E
500|$|Alex Paterson {{began his}} music {{career in the}} early 1980s as a roadie for the post-punk rock band Killing Joke, for whom his {{childhood}} friend Martin [...] "Youth" [...] Glover plays bass. After leaving Killing Joke in 1986, Paterson met future KLF member Jimmy Cauty and the duo began DJ-ing and producing music together under the name The Orb. Paterson and Cauty's first release was a 1988 acid house anthem track, [...] "Tripping on Sunshine", released on the German record compilation Eternity Project One. The following year, the Orb released the Kiss EP, a four-track EP based on samples from New York City's KISS FM. It was released on Paterson and Glover's new record label WAU! Mr. Modo Records, which they created out {{of a desire to}} maintain financial independence from larger record labels. After spending a weekend of making what Paterson described as [...] "really shit drum sounds", the duo decided to abandon beat-heavy music and instead work on music for after-hours listening by removing the percussion tracks. Paterson and Cauty began DJ-ing in London and landed a deal for the Orb to play the chill out room at London nightclub Heaven. Resident DJ Paul Oakenfold brought in the duo as ambient DJs for his [...] "The Land of Oz" [...] event at Heaven. Though the Orb's Monday night performances had only several hardcore followers initially, their chill-out room act grew popular over the course of their six-month stay {{to the point that the}} room was often packed with around 100people. The Orb's performances became most popular among weary DJs and clubbers seeking solace from the loud, rhythmic music of the dancefloor. The Orb built up melodies using multitrack recordings linked to multiple record decks and <b>a</b> <b>mixer.</b> The group incorporated many CDs, cassettes, and BBC sound effects into the act, often accompanied with pieces of popular dance tracks such as [...] "Sueño Latino." [...] Though the group used a variety of samples, they avoided heavy rhythm and drums so that the intended ambient atmosphere was not disrupted. Most often, the group played dub and other chill-out music, which it described as ambient house for the E generation.|$|E
