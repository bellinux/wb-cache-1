Through surface topography analysis of diversified coatings with SEM and AFM, TiAlN coatings represented the excellent surface quality of its smoothness, continuum, and low surface wave. To enhance the bonding force between the molding screw and coatings, TiAlN/Cr and TiAlN/Ti multi-films was developed which owned much more firm bonding force than TiAlN and good surface quality to be suitable for the special screw for manufacturing light <b>guiding</b> <b>plate.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{conventional}} method cannot {{guarantee the}} precise osteotomies {{required for a}} perfect realignment and a better prognosis after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This study investigated a customized <b>guide</b> <b>plate</b> for osteotomy placement in TKAs {{with the aid of}} the statistical shape model technique using weight-bearing lower-extremity X-rays and computed tomography (CT) images of the knee. Methods: From October 2014 to June 2015, 42 patients who underwent a TKA in Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital were divided into a <b>guide</b> <b>plate</b> group (GPG, 21 cases) and a traditional surgery group (TSG, 21 cases) using a random number table method. In the GPG group, a <b>guide</b> <b>plate</b> was designed and printed using preoperative three-dimensional measurements to plan and digitally simulate the operation. TSG cases were treated with the conventional method. Outcomes were obtained from the postoperative image examination and short-term follow-up. Results: Operative time was 49. 0 ± 10. 5 min for GPG, and 62. 0 ± 9. 7 min in TSG. The coronal femoral angle, coronal tibial angle, posterior tibial slope, and the angle between the posterior condylar osteotomy surface and the surgical transepicondylar axis were 89. 2 ± 1. 7 °, 89. 0 ± 1. 1 °, 6. 6 ± 1. 4 °, and 0. 9 ± 0. 3 ° in GPG, and 86. 7 ± 2. 9 °, 87. 6 ± 2. 1 °, 8. 9 ± 2. 8 °, and 1. 7 ± 0. 8 ° in TSG, respectively. The Hospital for Special Surgery scores 3 months after surgery were 83. 7 ± 18. 4 in GPG and 71. 5 ± 15. 2 in TSG. Statistically {{significant differences were found between}} GPG and TSG in all measurements. Conclusions: A customized <b>guide</b> <b>plate</b> to create an accurate osteotomy in TKAs may be created using lower-extremity X-ray and knee CT images. This allows for shorter operative times and better postoperative alignment than the traditional surgery. Application of the digital <b>guide</b> <b>plate</b> may also result in better short-term outcomes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTyphoon {{is one of}} {{the major}} natural {{disasters}} in Taiwan. The solar water heater system installed in the house roof has the most serious damage caused by typhoon invasion. Because the wind blows into the backward of the solar water heater system, the heat collecter is damaged by the stronger wind pressure gradient induced between the upper and lower. This study was using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) method to investigate the flowfield over a suspended and ground solar water heater during the wind speed about 30 m/s, and compared the results with the experimental data for validation. Simulations of 60 % solar water collector model with different tilt angles and 40 % model with different <b>guiding</b> <b>plate</b> were also done in this study to investigate the effect of the <b>guide</b> <b>plate.</b> The result shows that the 3 D flowfield effect is clear, and 2 D model can not simulated the flowfield. The heat collector erected away from the ground can be reduced to the uplift, and the separation bubbles are induced behind the bucket of the heat collector surface. The cornner vortices generated and interacted from the collector-side, and the separation bubbles is extending in spanwise. The larger tilt angle of the solar collector causes the larger pressure difference in the leading edge. The <b>guiding</b> <b>plate</b> avoids the inflow directly hit the bottom of the solar collector, and it can efficiently reduce the leading edge pressure difference. Nevertheless, when the cross-sectional area of the <b>guiding</b> <b>plate</b> increase, the uplift force acted on heat collector decreases and the drag force would be increased...|$|R

5000|$|Fine {{blanking}} presses {{are similar}} to other metal stamping presses, {{but they have a}} few critical additional parts. A typical compound fine blanking press includes a hardened die punch (male), the hardened blanking die (female), and a <b>guide</b> <b>plate</b> of similar shape/size to the blanking die. The <b>guide</b> <b>plate</b> is the first applied to the material, impinging the material with a sharp protrusion or stinger {{around the perimeter of the}} die opening. Next a counter pressure is applied opposite the punch, and finally the die punch forces the material through the die opening. Since the <b>guide</b> <b>plate</b> holds the material so tightly, and since the counter pressure is applied, the material is cut in a manner more like extrusion than typical punching. Mechanical properties of the cut benefit similarly with a hardened layer at the cut edge of the part. [...] Because the material is so tightly held and controlled in this setup, part flatness remains very true, distortion is nearly eliminated, and edge burr is minimal. Clearances between the die and punch are generally around 1% of the cut material thickness, which typically varies between 0.5 - 13 mm. Currently parts as thick as 19 mm can be cut using fine blanking. Tolerances between ±0.0003 - 0.002 in are possible, depending on base material thickness and tensile strength, and part layout.|$|R
