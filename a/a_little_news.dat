BRYANT SERVICE CLUB One Young Orchard Avenue, Providence, Rhode Island Dear Gang: Thank you for {{the very}} {{interesting}} letter on campus gossip, and Bryant news in general. I am especially pleased to note that courses have been added that will enable the enlisted man or officer candidate – elect to further himself through training received while on a civilian status. If you have a fairly good knowledge of military correspondence {{it will be a}} great help in securing an office position, and it is there that a good many of the ratings are held. With the basic fundamentals of proper Military Psychology typing, etc, you can concentrate on drilling, stripping, and assembling of weapons, gas, first aid, and camouflage courses. They are all extremely interesting. They would have to be to keep me up until two in the morning just assembling or stripping a submachine gun, blindfolded, just for the practice! In fact the other day my duties as First Sergeant got me out of bed (a very comfortable one at that) at 4 : 30 AM, and 2 : 30 the following morning found me very busily working out a camouflage problem on a clay model that I have compiled from pictures. Now <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>news</b> from the “home front”. Miss Mary B. Ronne was a graduate from Bryant. I used to go back and forth to college with her, and it looks as though another Bryant romance has blossomed, for on May 1 st we are to be married here at the post chapel. With the pack of “Indians” I have under my supervision, I rather imagine that it will be rather an elaborate affair, for my Commanding Officer has deemed that the affair calls for a “must” formation. That in itself will fill the chapel to an overflow. Well, thanks for remembering me. The address as you may gather is correct. Just how long it will continue to be correct will depend upon the War Department. Best regards to the faculty and to {{all the members of the}} Service Club. Very truly yours, LOUIS C.
