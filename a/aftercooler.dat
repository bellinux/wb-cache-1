5000|$|A coolpower setup {{in a truck}} engine uses an <b>aftercooler</b> on the {{cylinder}} head and a tip turbine fan to draw heat away from {{the cylinder}} head and ram air over the <b>aftercooler.</b> Large Mack trucks from the 1970s such as the Mack R-600 used coolpower systems.

40|$|Inlet air-cooling {{improves}} both {{efficiency and}} power of gas-turbine cycles. An absorption inlet-cooling system is introduced to the intercooled reheat recuperated gas-turbine cycle (I cycle). The exhaust gas of the cycle is used to run the system, which cools the inlet air to the low-pressure compressor and high-pressure compressor using two stages of cooling in the intercooler. Five different layouts of the I cycle are presented. Those layouts include the effects of absorption inlet cooling, evaporative inlet cooling, evaporative <b>aftercooling,</b> and absorption inlet cooling with evaporative <b>aftercooling.</b> A parametric study {{of the effect of}} pressure ratio, ambient temperature, ambient relative-humidity, turbine's inlet-temperature (TIT), and the effectiveness of the recuperated heat-exchanger ([var epsilon]HE 1) on the performance of all cycles is carried out. The results indicate that using two stages of cooling in the intercooler could boost the gain in efficiency, because of applying evaporative inlet cooling, by up to 1. 55 %. Applying absorption inlet-cooling could increase the efficiency of the I cycle by up to 6. 6 % compared with 3. 9 % for applying evaporative inlet cooling. Applying absorption inlet-cooling with evaporative <b>aftercooling</b> could increase the optimum efficiency of the I cycle by 3. 5 % and its maximum power by more than 50 %. Increasing TIT increases the capacity of the recuperated heat-exchanger and absorption cooling system and raises the gain in efficiency because of increasing [var epsilon]HE 1.

50|$|In 2010 the DT engines were updated {{once again}} for {{compliance}} with 2010 emissions standards. They all received new, twin turbochargers, with higher-rated versions of the MaxxForce DT and all MaxxForce 9 and 10 engines receiving intercooling and <b>aftercooling.</b> Upgrades to fuel injectors, the EGR system, and cooling were {{also part of the}} 2010 modifications.|$|R
5000|$|In the Battle of Britain the Spitfire and Hurricane planes {{powered by}} the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine were {{equipped}} largely with single stage and singlespeed superchargers. Stanley Hooker of Rolls Royce, to improve the performance of Merlin engine developed two-speed two-stage supercharging with <b>aftercooling</b> with a successful application on the Rolls Royce Merlin 61 aero engine in 1942. Horsepower was increased and performance at all aircraft heights. Hooker's developments allowed the aircraft they powered to maintain a crucial advantage over the German aircraft they opposed throughout World War II despite the German engines being significantly larger in displacement. [...] Two-stage superchargers were also always two-speed. After the air was compressed in the low-pressure stage, the air flowed through an intercooler radiator where it was cooled before being compressed again by the high-pressure stage and then possibly also <b>aftercooled</b> in another heat exchanger. Two-stage compressors provided much improved high altitude performance, as typified by the Rolls-Royce Merlin 61 powered Supermarine Spitfire Mk IX and the North American Mustang.|$|R
50|$|The MK5000C was {{powered by}} the 5000 hp Caterpillar V12 3612 diesel engine. This diesel engine {{remains one of the}} largest engine blocks used in rail service in North America. The Cat 3612 {{features}} a 280 mm bore with a 300 mm stroke and has a 1121 cuin L displacement per cylinder, 13456 cuin L total. The 3612 has dual turbochargers that are liquid <b>aftercooled.</b> The 3612 idles at 300 rpm and has a maximum speed of 1000 rpm.|$|R
50|$|A charge-air cooler {{is simply}} an all-encompassing term, meaning that it cools the turbo's air charge before it is routed into the engine. Usually a charge-air cooler means an air-to-air cooler where the heat is {{rejected}} using ambient air flowing through the heat exchanger, much like the engine's coolant radiator. While the multi-stage turbocharger systems are still in use in some tractor pull classes, selected high-performance diesels, and are also being used on newer late model commercial diesels, the term intercooler and <b>aftercooler</b> are used synonymously today. The term intercooler is widely used to mean in-between the Turbocharger and the engine. Both terms, intercooler or <b>aftercooler,</b> are correct, {{but this is the}} origin of the two terms that are used interchangeably by all levels of experts.|$|E
5000|$|The inter prefix in {{the device}} name {{originates}} from historic compressor designs. In the past, aircraft engines were built with Charge-Air Coolers that were installed between multiple stages of supercharging, thus {{the designation of}} inter. Modern automobile designs are technically designated aftercoolers because of their placement {{at the end of}} supercharging chain. This term is now considered archaic in modern automobile terminology since most forced induction vehicles have single-stage superchargers or turbochargers. In a vehicle fitted with two-stage turbocharging, it is possible to have both an intercooler (between the two turbocharger units) and an <b>aftercooler</b> (between the second-stage turbo and the engine).

50|$|The {{benefits}} of a two-stage supercharger eventually became so clear that Allison did make some efforts in this direction. Allison attached an auxiliary supercharger in various configurations to the existing engine-mounted supercharger and carburetor. Early versions of these two-stage supercharger engines were used on the P-63. No intercooler, <b>aftercooler,</b> or backfire screen (flame trap) were incorporated into these two-stage V-1710 engines (except for the V-1710-119 used on the experimental P-51J, which had an <b>aftercooler).</b> The two-stage Merlin engines had all of these features, which were designed to prevent detonation from charge heating and backfire into the supercharger. The G-series V-1710s installed on the F-82 E/F/G models had only anti-detonation injection (ADI) {{to deal with these}} problems, and not surprisingly had severe reliability and maintenance problems. In one record, it was stated that the F-82 required 33 hours of maintenance for each hour of flight.|$|E
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of Bryton Bottoming Systems (BBS) as {{waste heat recovery}} devices for future adiabatic diesel engines in heavy duty trucks is presented. Parametric studies were performed to evaluate the influence of external and internal design parameters on BBS performance. Conceptual design and trade-off studies were undertaken to estimate the optimum configuration, size, and cost of major hardware components. The potential annual fuel savings of long-haul trucks equipped with BBS were estimated. The addition of a BBS to a turbocharged, nonaftercooled adiabatic engine would improve fuel economy {{by as much as}} 12 %. In comparison with an <b>aftercooled,</b> turbocompound engine, the BBS-equipped turbocharged engine would offer a 4. 4 % fuel economy advantage. If installed in tandem with an <b>aftercooled</b> turbocompound engine, the BBS could effect a 7. 2 % fuel economy improvement. The cost of a mass-produced 38 Bhp BBS is estimated at about $ 6460 or 170 /Bhp. Technical and economic barriers that hinder the commercial introduction of bottoming systems were identified.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} pulse {{detonation}} combustion (PDC) model integrated within Chalmers University' s gas turbine simulation tool GESTPA N (GEneral Stationary and Transient Propulsion ANalsysis). The model {{will support the}} development of novel aircraft engine architectures exploiting the synergies between intercooling, <b>aftercooling</b> and PDC. The proposed engine architectures {{are based on a}} reference high bypass ratio geared-turbofan engine model with performance levels estimated to be available by year 2050. Parametric studies have been carried out for each proposed advanced architecture, providing engine cycle mid-cruise design point parameters. Design sensitivity studies related to intercooling technology in combination with a PDC are further explored for a number of heat-exchanger design effectiveness values and associated pressure loss levels. The acquired results suggest that the incorporation of PDC technology within a conventional core has the potential to significantly improve engine thermal efficiency. Incorporating intercooling improves the cycle performance for any pre-combustion OPR above 10 and contributes to an increase in specific power over the entire range of OPR. Finally, the results demonstrate that <b>aftercooling</b> the high pressure compressor delivery air further improves core specific power, but cancels out any SFC and thermal efficiency benefits arising from pulse detonation...|$|R

The results reveal that Diesel driving cycle performance can be increased by 20 % through increased turbocharging, turbocompounding, and Rankine engine compounding. The Rankine engine compounding provides about three times as much improvement as turbocompounding but also costs about three times as much.

Water cooling is eliminated by selective oil cooling of the components. A high temperature lubricant will be required due to increased in-cylinder operating temperatures. A two-stage turbocharger air system with intercooling and <b>aftercooling</b> was selected to meet engine boost and BMEP requirements. A turbocompound turbine stage is incorporated for exhaust energy recovery. The concept engine cost was estimated to be 43 percent higher compared to a Caterpillar 3176 engine.

50|$|The two RSD-7 demonstrators were {{significant}} for Alco. They were built {{with the intention}} of challenging the Fairbanks-Morse Train Master H24-66. When built in early 1954 the RSD-7 delivered the highest continuous tractive effort of all diesel locomotives then available. The RSD-7 offered 75% more dynamic braking capacity than any standard freight unit available at the time. The superlatives of the RSD-7 allowed two units to do the work of three conventional 4-motor units. The dynamic brake system was mounted on top the long hood, leaving room in the short hood for a steam generator. The RSD-7 was the first Alco built with the notched corner sand fills. The RSD-7 was the first Alco to use the coiled air brake intercoolers mounted just above and ahead of the radiator intakes. The RSD-7 was the first Alco to use the then new Model 710 water cooled turbocharger in a 16-cylinder engine. The two demonstrators were numbered DL600 and DL601. The DL600 weighed 360,000 pounds at the standard 60,000 pounds per axle. The DL601 weighed 390,000 to test the gains in adhesion from the extra weight. Additional experimentation by Alco used new fuel injection pumps and nozzles, increased fuel rack settings, and an <b>aftercooler</b> was applied to reduce engine air inlet temperature. The <b>aftercooler</b> allowed higher density inlet air into the engine that promoted greater fuel burning efficiency. The <b>aftercooler</b> became the feature that allowed the 244 to be pushed to 2400 horsepower and the designation of 244H. The 244H is also known as the Alco 250 engine to disassociate it from the troubled 244 engine series. The maroon, yellow and gray painted RSD-7 demonstrators began a 23-railroad, 50,000 mile demonstration tour in the Spring of 1954. The tour concluded in September 1954 and the two units were refurbished before sale to the Santa Fe.|$|E

The Ariete's engine had to run at a high RPM to perform well, thus reducing the operating time between failures.|$|E
40|$|Steam {{bottoming}} cycles using {{adiabatic diesel}} engine exhaust heat which projected substantial performance and economic benefits for long haul trucks were studied. Steam cycle and system component variables, system cost, size and performance were analyzed. An 811 K/ 6. 90 MPa {{state of the}} art reciprocating expander steam system with a monotube boiler and radiator core condenser was selected for preliminary design. The costs of the diesel with bottoming system (TC/B) and a NASA specified turbocompound adiabatic diesel with <b>aftercooling</b> with the same total output were compared, the annual fuel savings less the added maintenance cost was determined to cover the increase initial cost of the TC/B system in a payback period of 2. 3 years.

40|$|A {{dynamic model}} of a Heavy Duty (HD) {{turbocharged}} and <b>aftercooled</b> diesel engine was developed. The engine was equipped with high pressure diesel injection, a Variable Geometry Turbine (VGT) and an Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system. This engine was targeted at meeting EURO 4 emission requirements. The final emission results were 2. 4 g/kWh NOx and 0. 107 g/kWh particulates for the European 13 mode test. Better than 3. 0 g/kWh NOx and 0. 10 g/kWh particulates {{are expected to be}} characteristic EURO 4 emission requirements (approximate year of implementation is 2004). In the design of the EGR system the model provided initial asessments of the properties of this system. Associated engine and turbocharger behaviour as well as optimal control strategies were predicted. A transient engine control algorithm was developed using the dynamic engine model. The VGT is closed loop controlled and EGR is shut off during a short time after a load increase. The simulation results were confirmed by actual measurements, demonstrating acceptable transient behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the performance and emissions characteristics of a turbocharged and <b>aftercooled</b> diesel engine operated with natural gas as primary fuel, and diesel fuel as ignition source. In such dual fuel operation, much of the energy released comes from the combustion of the gaseous fuel, while only a small amount of diesel fuel provides ignition through timed cylinder injection. The effects of diesel-natural gas substitution ratios, engine speed, and load on the equivalent brake specific fuel consumption and gaseous emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides are examined for natural gas-diesel fuel operation and, afterward, compared with the original diesel operation. The results show that, over a wide range of operating conditions (engine speed, load), the dual fuel engine clearly shows the benefits of reduced NOX emissions. However, under low loads, the results indicate high CO and HC emissions and a higher BSFC when compared to those of the corresponding diesel engine...|$|R
