5|$|At 17:00 {{the first}} CH-46 landed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Embassy.</b> Between 19:00 and 21:00 on 29 April {{approximately}} 130 additional Marines from 2nd Battalion 4th Marines were {{lifted from the}} DAO Compound to reinforce perimeter security <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Embassy,</b> bringing {{the total number of}} Marines <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Embassy</b> to 175. The evacuation from the DAO Compound was completed by about 19:00 after which all helicopters would be routed to the Embassy; Major Kean was informed that operations would cease at dark. Major Kean advised that the LZ would be well lit and had vehicles moved around the parking lot LZ with their engines running and headlights on to illuminate the LZ. At 21:30 a CH-53 pilot informed Major Kean that Admiral Whitmire, Commander of Task Force 76 had ordered that operations would cease at 23:00. Major Kean saw Ambassador Martin to request that he contact the Oval Office to ensure that the airlift continued. Ambassador Martin soon sent word back to Major Kean that sorties would continue to be flown. At the same time, General Carey met Admiral Whitmire to convince him to resume flights to the Embassy despite pilot fatigue and poor visibility caused by darkness, fires and bad weather.|$|E

The 60 {{soldiers}} selected for the security detail were issued weapons and ammunition. Two Marine Corps KC-130 refueling tankers were mobilized closer to the operation, from Bahrain to Oman, to refuel the helicopters en route to Mogadishu and the two helicopters transferred from Trenton to Guam.|$|E
5|$|Some 400 {{evacuees}} {{were left}} behind <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Embassy</b> including over 100 South Korean citizens, among them was Brigadier General Dai Yong Rhee, the intelligence chief at the South Korean Embassy in Saigon. The South Korean civilians were evacuated in 1976, while General Rhee and two other diplomats were held captive until April 1980.

5|$|The August 26, 1977 ABC Evening News {{covered the}} story of a major fire <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>embassy.</b> Despite the {{severity}} of the fire, all personnel were evacuated safely, and the efforts of the embassy staff elicited a commendation from President Jimmy Carter. Former KGB agent Victor Sheymov testified before Congress in 1998 that the fire was deliberately induced by the Soviets in an effort to gain access to sensitive areas by agents posing as firemen.|$|E

5|$|After Lavasani's {{body had}} been recovered, Sir David McNee, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, {{contacted}} the Home Secretary to request approval to hand control of the operation over to the British Army, under the provisions of Military Aid to the Civil Power. Whitelaw relayed the request to Thatcher, {{and the prime minister}} agreed immediately. Thus John Dellow, the ranking police officer <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>embassy,</b> signed over control of the operation to Lieutenant Colonel Mike Rose at 19:07, authorising Rose to order an assault at his discretion. Meanwhile, the police negotiators began stalling Oan. They offered concessions in order to distract him and prevent him killing further hostages, buying time for the SAS to make its final preparations for the now-inevitable assault.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of 29 April it was {{estimated}} that approximately 10,000 people had gathered around the Embassy, while some 2,500 evacuees were in the Embassy and consular compounds. The crowds prevented the use of buses for transporting evacuees from the Embassy to the DAO Compound for evacuation and the Embassy gates were closed to prevent the crowd from surging through. Eligible evacuees now had to make themselves known to the Marine guards or Embassy staff manning the walls and were then lifted over the walls and into the Embassy compound. Among those arriving <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Embassy</b> were Dr Phan Quang Dan, former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister responsible for social welfare and refugee resettlement, and Lieutenant-General Dang Van Quang.|$|E
5|$|Denning became {{best known}} {{as a result of his}} report into the Profumo Affair. John Profumo was the Secretary of State for War with the British government. At a party in 1961 Profumo was {{introduced}} to Christine Keeler, a showgirl, and began having an affair with her. At the same time she was in a relationship with Yevgeni Ivanov, a naval attaché <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> of the Soviet Union. On 26 January 1963 Keeler was contacted by police on an unrelated matter and voluntarily gave them information about her relationship with Profumo.|$|E

5|$|Following the bombing, French Gabonese {{made more}} {{threatening}} {{phone calls to}} the embassy. A second bomb exploded <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> two nights later, causing no damage. A drive-by shooting, during which at least five rounds of buckshot were fired from a 12-gauge automatic shotgun, riddled the second story windows with over 30 holes. It is likely that its perpetrators were French, as Gabonese {{have no access to}} grenades. Following the second bombing a car containing white men was noticed, driving through otherwise empty Shore Boulevard. At the time, practically the only white men in Gabon were French.|$|E
5|$|In April 1987 Reagan {{appointed}} Matlock as Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Conditions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Embassy</b> were tense, as Marine Sergeant Clayton Lonetree {{had been}} found to have compromised Embassy security. Within a few months of the Lonetree scandal, all U.S. intelligence assets in the Soviet Union had been exposed. The Americans suspected that the security breach had meant that the Embassy code room was no longer secure and worked frantically to determine how. It was not until 1994 that Aldrich Ames, a mole within the CIA, was caught. Another mole, Robert Hanssen, this time within the FBI, was caught only in 2001.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August, the Kennedy {{administration}} sent Cable 243 to Lodge <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> in Saigon, marking {{a change}} in American policy. The message advised Lodge to seek {{the removal of the}} Nhus from power, and to look for alternative leadership options if Diệm refused to heed American pressure for reform. As the probability of Diệm sidelining the Nhus was seen as virtually nil, the message effectively meant the fomenting of a coup. The Voice of America broadcast a statement blaming Nhu for the raids and absolving the army of responsibility. Aware that the Americans would neither oppose a coup nor respond with aid cuts or sanctions, the generals deposed the Ngô brothers, who were arrested and assassinated the next day, 2 November 1963.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 January, a 60-person Marine and Navy SEAL {{security}} detail was dispatched from Guam aboard two CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters to secure the embassy and prepare for the main evacuation. The two helicopters returned to Guam with the first 61 evacuees. Throughout the day, foreign diplomats and civilians sought refuge <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>embassy.</b> Four waves of five CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters each evacuated the embassy compound shortly after midnight on 6 January. The evacuees were transported to Muscat, Oman, where they disembarked on 11 January. In total, 281 diplomats and civilians from 30 countries were evacuated, including 12 heads of missions (eight ambassadors and four chargés d'affaires).|$|E
5|$|Shaw {{made his}} Broadway debut in 1929, {{when he played}} the murderer Wyndham Brandon in Patrick Hamilton's stage thriller, Rope's End.

5|$|When Häyhänen {{announced}} himself <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> on 4 May, {{he appeared}} drunk. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) {{officials at the}} Paris embassy did not find Häyhänen's story credible. They weren't convinced he might actually be a Russian spy until he produced a hollow Finnish 5-mark coin. Upon opening the coin a square of microfilm was revealed. On May 11, the CIA returned him to the United States and handed {{him over to the}} FBI. As a member of a Soviet spy ring operating on American soil, Häyhänen came under the FBI's jurisdiction and they began verifying his story.|$|E
5000|$|A {{cleaning}} woman and French spy {{by the name}} of Madame Bastian working <b>at</b> <b>the</b> German <b>Embassy</b> was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> source of the investigation.

5|$|About January 1944, Moyzisch hired a new {{secretary}} named Cornelia Kapp, {{also known}} as Nele Kapp, who had spied for the British and Americans in exchange for permission to immigrate to the United States. She had worked at the Germany embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria beginning in July 1943 and within a month had become a spy. In January 1944, she moved to Ankara {{to work at the}} German embassy under Moyzisch. Kapp was asked by the OSS to learn about the spy that Moyzisch met with. Kapp was adept at gathering intelligence within the office. She flirted with Cicero when he called the office to schedule a meeting with Moyzisch. When she could, Kapp also followed the two men to try to see what the spy looked like, but was unsuccessful at getting a good view of him. Kapp had gathered and shared a lot of information with the OSS over the months that she worked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>embassy,</b> including all that she felt that she could learn about Cicero.|$|E
5|$|After {{his work}} at the UN, Soedjatmoko {{attempted}} to study at Harvard's Littauer Center for Public Administration (now the John F. Kennedy School of Government); however, he was forced to resign due to pressure from other work, including serving as Indonesia's first chargé d'affaires in London for three months as well as establishing the political desk <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Embassy</b> of Indonesia in Washington, D.C. By 1952 he had returned to Indonesia, where he became involved in the socialist press and joined the Socialist Party of Indonesia. He was elected {{as a member of the}} Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia in 1955, serving until 1959; he married Ratmini Gandasubrata in 1958. However, as President Sukarno's government became more authoritarian Soedjatmoko began to criticise the government. To avoid censorship, he spent two years as a guest lecturer at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and another three in self-imposed unemployment in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|By 02:15 on 30 April one CH-46 and one CH-53 were landing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Embassy</b> every 10 minutes. At this time, the Embassy {{indicated}} that another 19 lifts would complete the evacuation. At that time Major Kean {{estimated that there}} were still some 850 non-American evacuees and 225 Americans (including the Marines), and Ambassador Martin told Major Kean {{to do the best}} he could. At 03:00 Ambassador Martin ordered Major Kean to move all the remaining evacuees into the parking lot LZ which was the Marines' final perimeter. At 03:27 President Gerald Ford ordered that no more than 19 additional lifts would be allowed to complete the evacuation. At 04:30 with the 19 lift limit already exceeded, Major Kean went to the rooftop LZ and spoke over a helicopter radio with General Carey who advised that President Ford had ordered that the airlift be limited to US personnel. Major Kean was then ordered to withdraw his men into the Chancery building and withdraw to the rooftop LZ for evacuation.|$|E
