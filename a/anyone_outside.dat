The Governor can, however, enforce temporary bans on snowmobiles or even all travel within the national park. Use of helicopters and aircraft for sight-seeing are also prohibited. Polar bears are protected, but <b>anyone</b> <b>outside</b> of settlements is required to carry a rifle to kill polar bears in self-defense, as a last resort, should they attack. Most flora and fauna are protected; the right to gather established with the freedom to roam does not apply in national parks, although there are some exceptions. Hunting is permitted after explicit permit from the Governor, and locals have more access to hunting rights than tourists. Fishing is not permitted, although dispensations can be given.|$|E
25|$|According to the Priestly Code of the Book of Numbers, killing <b>anyone</b> <b>outside</b> {{the context}} of war with a weapon, or in unarmed combat, is {{considered}} retzach, but if the killing is accidental, the accused must not leave the city, or he will be considered guilty of intentional murder. The Bible never uses the word retzach in conjunction with war.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, Raiford {{was one of}} {{only six}} black men {{recruited}} by a then all white Greensboro Police Department. Although the tall and muscular man was proud to be a pioneering member of law enforcement, Raiford resented the way he and his fellow black officers were treated in a city that was then one of the more populated incorporated areas in the Tarheel state. The officers were not allowed to arrest <b>anyone</b> <b>outside</b> their ethnicity.|$|E

25|$|Otherwise, draw {{a square}} box around the Schwartz set, {{in the upper}} left corner. You can {{describe}} it as the minimal 'winner's circle' of candidates who do not lose to <b>anyone</b> <b>outside</b> the circle. Note that {{to the right of}} the box there is no red, which means it's a winner's circle, and note that within the box there is no reordering possible that will produce a smaller winner's circle (if the Schwartz set has no more than three candidates, this not hard).|$|E
25|$|Kelly Bundy (Christina Applegate)—the Bundys' firstborn; a stereotypical dumb blonde who {{is often}} derided as {{promiscuous}} and dates men who get under Al's skin {{to the point}} of him physically assaulting them. Her stupidity manifests in many ways, from forgetting ideas on the spot to mispronouncing or misspelling simple words. Like her mother, she is quick to steal Al's money for expensive things. Her favorite hobby is belittling her lonely and sexless brother, though she stands up for him against <b>anyone</b> <b>outside</b> the family.|$|E
25|$|Conor O'Brien formed Villagers {{after the}} {{break-up}} {{of his previous}} band The Immediate. The very next day, O'Brien wrote the first song after waking up with a hangover. O'Brien's time as a guitarist in Cathy Davey's band was also critical {{to the development of}} his style as he had never before performed alongside <b>anyone</b> <b>outside</b> of The Immediate. Villagers gave their first live performance as a support act with The Chapters at a show in Whelan's in November 2008. At that point the band had previously only rehearsed together on two occasions. They had only seven songs, written by O'Brien and passed on {{to the rest of the}} band to learn.|$|E

25|$|When {{the clergy}} and the nobles elected {{different}} candidates in 844, Emperor Lothair I sided with Pope Sergius II, the noble candidate; {{three years later}} Pope Leo IV was consecrated without imperial approval, {{which would have been}} difficult in any case as the Carolingian Empire {{was in the process of}} breaking up. Lothair II of Lotharingia indeed failed to impose his own candidate, Pope Benedict III, in 855 until the Roman-elected candidate refused the office (the first recorded historical refusal). Lothair II was present for the election of Pope Nicholas I, who prohibited <b>anyone</b> <b>outside</b> of the Roman community from interfering in papal elections, and as a result Pope Adrian II was consecrated without even informing the Franks.|$|E
25|$|The guidon is a {{great source}} of pride for the unit, and several {{military}} traditions have developed around it, stemming back from ancient times. Any sort of disgrace toward the guidon is considered a dishonor of the unit as a whole, and punishment is typical. For example, should the guidon bearer drop the guidon, they must fall with it and perform punishment, often in the form of push-ups. Other units may attempt to steal the guidon to demoralize or antagonize the unit. Veteran soldiers know not to give up the guidon to <b>anyone</b> <b>outside</b> their unit, but new recruits may be tempted into relinquishing it by a superior, especially during a unit run.|$|E
500|$|Roxette {{has also}} {{worked in the}} studio on their tenth studio album, Good Karma. They have worked with young {{producers}} from Sweden like Addeboy vs Cliff [...] "to inject new blood into the Roxette sound". Remixes aside, {{this is the first}} time that they have allowed <b>anyone</b> <b>outside</b> of the Roxette canon to produce new music. On 8 April 2016, the lead single off the album, [...] "It Just Happens", was released. The album followed on 3 June 2016.|$|E
50|$|Transportation {{has also}} {{improved}} as flotillas of tricycle taxis (tuk-tuks) and passenger vans (micros) {{provide services to}} any location in the area. While the Maya remain suspicious of <b>anyone</b> from <b>outside</b> small rural communities, {{they are interested in}} foreign contacts and often invite travelers into their homes and festivals.|$|R

500|$|As a result, {{like most}} of her sisters, Princess Sophia was forced to live {{her life as a}} {{companion}} of her mother. The princesses were not allowed to mix with <b>anyone</b> <b>outside</b> of the Royal Court, and rarely came into contact with men other than pages, equerries, or attendants. Constantly chaperoned, the girls frequently complained about living in a [...] "Nunnery". For entertainment, the queen read sermons to them and the princesses practised embroidery. On one occasion Sophia wrote their days were so [...] "deadly dull... I wished myself a kangaroo." ...|$|E
500|$|The writers {{killed off}} the {{recurring}} character [...] "Deep Throat" [...] to give audiences {{the impression that}} <b>anyone</b> <b>outside</b> of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully were expendable. The decision {{to shut down the}} X-Files was done to separate Mulder and Scully, allowing the producers to work around Gillian Anderson's pregnancy (which contributed to an important plot development in the second season and affected the rest of the series). Fox initially opposed the idea, fearing that closing down the X-Files would lead viewers to believe that the show had been cancelled.|$|E
500|$|A two-disc [...] "deluxe edition" [...] was {{released}} by MCA on June 25, 2002. The first disc contains the remastered original album, while the second contains several radio edits and remixes. It was presented as a foldout double-disc set enhoused in a slipcase, with an extensive booklet with liner notes and rare photographs. AllMusic suggest that although the album deserves the attention, [...] "the extra disc of material is [...] worth the time of <b>anyone</b> <b>outside</b> of fanatics... it doesn't really offer any revelations, curiosities, or an interesting listen for anybody else (and {{it may not be}} that interesting to those collectors, either)." ...|$|E
50|$|Outside of parties, kapustniki are a {{tradition}} in Russian theatre. To have one, actors choose an evening when no performance is planned and show their own funny plays for each other. Although rarely is <b>anyone</b> from <b>outside</b> the theatre's staff invited, many fans {{try to get in}} anyway. Due to their questionable copyright, kapustniks can rarely be broadcast or recorded.|$|R

He worked with two colleagues from the university, Kellogg and Clarke, to improve the situation. He took a more innovative approach to education—for example, assigning more interesting schoolwork and sending <b>anyone</b> misbehaving <b>outside</b> (making schoolwork a privilege).|$|R
500|$|After John Glenn's flight, Kraft {{had vowed}} {{that he would}} no longer allow his {{decisions}} as flight director to be overruled by <b>anyone</b> <b>outside</b> Mission Control. The mission rules, whose drafting had been overseen by Kraft, stated that [...] "the flight director may, after analysis of the flight, choose to take any necessary action required for the successful completion of the mission." [...] For Kraft, the power that the flight director held over every aspect of the mission extended to his control over the actions of the astronauts. In his 1965 interview with Time Magazine, he stated: ...|$|E
500|$|Secrecy is {{maintained}} during the conclave; the cardinals {{as well as}} the conclavists and staff are forbidden to disclose any information relating to the election. Cardinal electors may not correspond or converse with <b>anyone</b> <b>outside</b> the conclave, by post, radio, telephone, internet and social media, or otherwise and eavesdropping is an offense punishable by excommunication latae sententiae. [...] Only three cardinals electors are permitted to communicate with the outside world under grave circumstances, prior to approval of the College, to fulfil their duties: [...] the Major Penitentiary, the Cardinal Vicar for the Diocese of Rome, and the Vicar General for the Vatican City State.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{the fictional}} Lad, {{he was not}} {{registered}} with the American Kennel Club and was not a show dog. His pedigree was reportedly lost {{by one of his}} previous owners, though there was no doubt he was a purebred collie. At one point, Terhune's wife Anice claimed Lad had twenty champion collies in his pedigree, but this has never been confirmed. On July 4, 1917, Lad was entered into a dog show despite having no papers on his pedigree. [...] It was the only show he ever attended and he won the Veteran Cup. As in the novel, Lad was extremely, even [...] "hostile reserved" [...] with strangers, wanting little to do with <b>anyone</b> <b>outside</b> of the family.|$|E

500|$|Diệm's {{address on}} Double Seven Day worsened {{the mood of}} Vietnamese society. He stated that the [...] "problems raised by the General Association of Buddhists have just been settled." [...] He {{reinforced}} perceptions that {{he was out of}} touch by attributing any lingering problems to the [...] "underground intervention of international red agents and Communist fellow travelers who in collusion with fascist ideologues disguised as democrats were surreptitiously seeking to revive and rekindle disunity at home while arousing public opinions against us abroad". The remark about fascists was seen as a reference to the conspiratorial Đại Việt Quốc dân đảng who had long been enemies of Diem, but his address attacked all those who had criticised him in the past. He no longer trusted <b>anyone</b> <b>outside</b> his family and considered himself to be a martyr.|$|E
500|$|On August 15, Sherron Watkins, vice {{president}} for corporate development, sent an anonymous letter to Lay warning him about the company's accounting practices. One statement in the letter said: [...] "I am incredibly nervous that we will implode {{in a wave of}} accounting scandals." [...] Watkins contacted a friend who worked for Arthur Andersen and he drafted a memorandum to give to the audit partners about the points she raised. On August 22, Watkins met individually with Lay and gave him a six-page letter further explaining Enron's accounting issues. Lay questioned her as to whether she had told <b>anyone</b> <b>outside</b> of the company and then vowed to have the company's law firm, Vinson & Elkins, review the issues, although she argued that using the law firm would present a conflict of interest. Lay consulted with other executives, and although they wanted to dismiss Watkins (as Texas law did not protect company whistleblowers), they decided against it to prevent a lawsuit. On October 15, Vinson & Elkins announced that Enron had done nothing wrong in its accounting practices as Andersen had approved each issue.|$|E
500|$|Motivated by the {{inspirational}} Christophe Dugarry, Birmingham's first top-flight {{season for}} 16 years finished in mid-table. Loan signing Mikael Forssell's 17 league goals helped Birmingham to a top-half finish in 2003–04, though performances and results tailed off badly {{towards the end}} of the season. First-team coach Mark Bowen was sacked and replaced by Eric Black, international players were signed, but an injury to Forssell left the 2004–05 team struggling for goals. More transfer window loan signings ensured another mid-table finish. Only two months later, chairman David Gold said it was time to [...] "start talking about being as good as <b>anyone</b> <b>outside</b> the top three or four" [...] with [...] "the best squad of players for 25 years". Injuries, lack of form, and a lack of investment during the transfer window saw them relegated before the last game of a season whose lowlight was a 0–7 FA Cup defeat to Liverpool. Jermaine Pennant and Emile Heskey left for record fees, many more were released, but Bruce retained the confidence of the board. His amended recruitment strategy, combining young [...] "hungry" [...] players with free-transfer experience and shrewd exploitation of the loan market, brought automatic promotion at the end of a season which had included calls for his head.|$|E

25|$|While {{specific}} rules for triathlon can {{vary depending on}} the governing body (e.g. USA Triathlon, ITU), as well as for an individual race venue, there are some basic universal rules. Traditionally, triathlon is an individual sport and each athlete is competing against the course and the clock for the best time. As such, athletes are not allowed to receive assistance from <b>anyone</b> else <b>outside</b> the race, with the exception of race-sanctioned aid volunteers who distribute food and water on the course.|$|R
