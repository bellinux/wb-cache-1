I not only admit this, I am ready to unite in groaning over the threatened danger. To one who loves his native language, who would delight to keep our rich and harmonious English undefiled by foreign <b>accent,</b> <b>foreign</b> intonation, and those foreign tinctures of verbal meaning which tend to confuse all writing and discourse, it is an affliction as harassing as the climate, that on our stage, in our studios, at our public and private gatherings, in our offices, warehouses, and workshops, we must expect to hear our beloved English with its words clipped, its vowels stretched and twisted, its phrases of acquiescence and politeness, of cordiality, dissidence or argument, delivered always in the wrong tones, like ill-rendered melodies, marred beyond recognition; {{that there should be a}} general ambition to speak every language except our mother English, which persons [...] "of style" [...] are not ashamed of corrupting with slang, false foreign equivalents, and a pronunciation that crushes out all colour from the vowels and jams them between jostling consonants. An ancient Greek might not like to be resuscitated for the sake of hearing Homer read in our universities, still he would at least find more instructive marvels in other developments to be witnessed at those institutions; but a modern Englishman is invited from his after-dinner repose to hear Shakspere delivered under circumstances which offer no other novelty than some novelty of false intonation, some new distribution of strong emphasis on prepositions, some new misconception of a familiar idiom. Well! it is our inertness that is in fault, our carelessness of excellence, our willing ignorance of the treasures that lie in our national heritage, while we are agape after what is foreign, though it may be only a vile imitation of what is native.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Speech signal in {{addition}} to the linguistic information contains additional information about the speaker: age, gender, social status, <b>accent</b> (<b>foreign</b> accent, dialects, etc.), emotional state, health etc. Some of these informational channels induce changes of the speech acoustic characteristics. This article presents evaluation of the ASR acoustic models (first trained on neutral, read speech) on acted and spontaneous emotional speech. In our research we used adaptation approaches to compensate the mismatch of acoustic characteristics between neutral speech samples and affective speech material. During experiments we observed that the affective-speech-adapted ASR acoustic models provide better emotional-speech-recognition performance. The improvements of affective speech recognition performance were 6. 24 % absolute (7. 1 % relative) for speaker-independent evaluations on the EMO-DB database and 7. 08 % absolute (25. 43 % relative) for cross-corpora evaluation on the VAM database...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The main {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} was to establish {{the extent to which}} the impression of foreignness in speakers with <b>Foreign</b> <b>Accent</b> Syndrome (FAS) is in any way comparable to the impression of foreignness in speakers with a real <b>foreign</b> <b>accent.</b> Method: Three groups of listeners attributed accents to conversational speech samples of 5 FAS speakers which were embedded amongst those of 5 speakers with a real <b>foreign</b> <b>accent</b> and 5 native speaker controls. The listener groups differed in their familiarity with <b>foreign</b> <b>accented</b> speech and speech pathology. Results: The findings indicate that listeners’ perceptual reactions to the three groups of speakers are essentially different at all levels of analysis. The native speaker controls are unequivocally considered as native speakers of Dutch while the speakers with a real <b>foreign</b> <b>accent</b> are very reliably assessed as non-native speakers. The speakers with <b>Foreign</b> <b>Accent</b> Syndrome, however, are in some sense perceived as foreign and in some sense as native by listeners, but not as foreign as speakers with a real <b>foreign</b> <b>accent</b> nor as native as real native speakers. This result may be accounted for in terms of the trigger support model of <b>foreign</b> <b>accent</b> perception. Conclusions: The findings of the experiment is consistent with the idea that the very nature of the <b>foreign</b> <b>accent</b> in different in both groups of speakers, although it cannot be fully excluded that the perceived foreignness in the two groups is one of degree...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} segmental <b>foreign</b> <b>accent</b> phenomena, i. e. individual {{sounds as}} spoken by non-native speakers {{of a language}} and their characteristic deviances from the language norm. The first chapter introduces basic terminology and identifies some difficulties in defining several concepts essential to <b>foreign</b> <b>accent</b> research and research on second language acquisition in general. Terms like <b>accent,</b> native and <b>foreign</b> language or bilingualism are introduced and the according definitions are discussed as proposed in the literature. Chapter 2 gives an overview on various variables in experimental studies on L 2 speech production, and <b>foreign</b> <b>accent</b> and the factors which {{have been found to}} influence the degree of <b>foreign</b> <b>accent.</b> This chapter is primarily concerned with extralinguistic variables which correspond to characteristics of the examined speakers like gender, age or their previous language experiences. However, the influence of a speaker’s L 1 on his or her L 2 is also discussed in that chapter. An overview of the research literature on various segmental acoustic, i. e. phonetic and phonological manifestations of <b>foreign</b> <b>accent</b> is given in chapter 3. The most often analysed acoustic phenomena are identified and fields which received only marginal attention in <b>foreign</b> <b>accent</b> research are addressed...|$|R

It was observed that using models trained on foreign data together with native models improves the recognition for speakers with <b>foreign</b> <b>accent.</b> However such an approach degrades the recognition performances on native speakers. In order to avoid such performance degradation the degree of accent should be detected prior to the recognition process.

40|$|<b>Foreign</b> <b>accented</b> speech {{recognition}} systems {{have to deal}} with the acoustic realization of sounds by non-native speakers that does not always match with native models. Thus the standard native speech modelling alone is generally not adequate, and it is usually extended with models of phonemes estimated from speech data of foreign languages, and often complemented with extra pronunciation variants. Previous studies showed that such modelling techniques are effective. In this paper, several modelling approaches are briefly recalled and their performances in the recognition of non-native speech comprising multiple <b>foreign</b> <b>accents,</b> are analyzed. Afterwards, the adaptation of the acoustic models on various sets of non-native speech is studied.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this paper}} is to report the psychiatric, neuroradiological and {{linguistic}} characteristics in a native speaker of Dutch who developed speech symptoms which strongly resemble <b>Foreign</b> <b>Accent</b> Syndrome. Background: <b>Foreign</b> <b>Accent</b> Syndrome is a rare speech production disorder in which the speech of a patient is perceived as foreign by speakers of the same speech community. This syndrome is generally related to focal brain damage. Only in few reported cases the <b>Foreign</b> <b>Accent</b> Syndrome is assumed to be of psychogenic and/or psychotic origin. Method: In addition to clinical and neuroradiological examinations, an extensive test battery of standardized neuropsychological and neurolinguistic investigations was carried out. Two samples of the patient's spontaneous speech were analysed and compared to a 500, 000 -words reference corpus of 160 normal native speakers of Dutch. Results: The patient had a prominent French accent in her pronunciation of Dutch. This accent had persisted over the past eight years and has become progressively stronger. The foreign qualities of her speech did not only relate to pronunciation, but also to the lexicon, syntax and pragmatics. Structural as well as functional neuroimaging did not reveal evidence that could account for the behavioural symptoms. By contrast psychological investigations indicated conversion disorder. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case of a <b>foreign</b> <b>accent</b> like syndrome in conversion disorder...|$|R
