And Mr. Presley, {{if you are}} watching this in Hollywood, and I may address myself to you. It has been many a year since any young performer has captured such a wide, and, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> tonight, devoted audience." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2011 Wal-Mart {{recalled}} {{a quantity of}} infant formula after a baby died in Missouri. [...] "We extend our deepest condolences to this baby boy's family {{as they try to}} come to grips with their loss," [...] said Dianna Gee, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman. [...] "As soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> what happened, we immediately reached out to the manufacturer of the formula and to the Department of Health and Senior Services to provide any information we may have to help with the investigation." [...] Wal-Mart said it pulled a batch of Enfamil from its stores nationwide that matched the size and lot number ZP1k7G of the formula that may have sickened the baby in Missouri, Gee said. The baby formula was purchased from a Wal-Mart in Lebanon, Missouri. After the purchase, a 10-day-old infant died from a rare bacterial infection, CNN affiliate KYTV reported. Authorities ran tests to determine if the death came from the formula, the water to make the formula or any other factor, said Mead Johnson Nutrition, the company that makes Enfamil. [...] "We are highly confident in the safety and quality of our products â€“ and the rigorous testing we put them through," [...] said Chris Perille, a Mead Johnson Nutrition spokesman.|$|E

6000|$|... "Words, words, Horatio!" [...] Now let us hear Chaucer {{with his}} single {{stealthy}} line {{that makes us}} glance over our shoulder <b>as</b> if <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> the murderous tread behind us: ...|$|R
60|$|Here {{the poor}} girl told a melancholy story, how an aunt had brought up {{her and her}} sister, and how barbarously she had used them, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard.</b>|$|R
2500|$|There are clearly, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard,</b> {{major policy}} {{differences}} between the two of you. Are there also underlying character issues that you believe [...] that you believe are serious enough to deny Senator Kerry the job as commander-in-chief of the United States? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bad news. Conde and the Admiral are {{not letting}} the grass grow under their feet. They have {{captured}} not only Niort, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> yesterday, but Parthenay." ...|$|E
6000|$|And this is {{the story}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> it from one source and another until there could be no {{question}} but that we had all the facts with no embellishments: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is {{probably}} making {{good use of}} his time," [...] was Tom's comment. [...] "He knew we would be after him hot-footed, just as soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> of his being here." ...|$|E
60|$|A certain Sunday morning, I remember, {{broke with}} a cloud-flecked sky, and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> were {{preparing}} to go afield with such ploughs as could be got together (we were to sow turnips) the loud sounds of a quarrel came from the elm at the spring. With one accord {{men and women and}} children flocked thither, and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> ran <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> McGary's voice above the rest. Worming my way, boylike, through the crowd, I came upon McGary and Harrod glaring at each other in the centre of it.|$|R
5000|$|There are clearly, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard,</b> {{major policy}} {{differences}} between the two of you.

6000|$|... "Ah! I {{suppose you}} are going to Gakdul. As far <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard,</b> there are no Dervishes there. Well, you must keep a sharp lookout. They may be in hiding {{anywhere}} about there, and your heads won't be worth much, if they lay hands on you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At least," [...] said I <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> her quick, firm steps {{descending}} the stairs, [...] "she {{seems to}} be a young lady who is very well {{able to take care of}} herself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look out!" [...] whispered Jack; but {{the warning}} was {{scarcely}} needed, for we instinctively seized our rifles. A moment after our hearts leaped violently <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> a crashing step that betokened {{the approach of}} some huge creature.|$|E
6000|$|... "It may be," [...] said Flammock, [...] "that Gwenwyn {{may have}} {{forgotten}} the promise, and so fail to appear to claim it in the appointed space; for, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard,</b> your wines of France flooded his Welsh brains deeply." ...|$|E
60|$|After {{their talk}} they parted on very good terms, {{and it was}} in {{consequence}} of that unreported conversation, whereof the reader nevertheless can pretty well guess the bearing, that Arthur expressed himself <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> in the colloquy with Warrington, which is reported in the last chapter.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have made}} a good {{beginning}} everywhere, <b>as</b> far <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard,</b> but you must remember {{that it is only}} a beginning. Even suppose the whites of the town do nothing, and I fancy we shall hear of them presently, they will send over troops from France." ...|$|R
60|$|These {{words would}} startle us, if <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> {{them for the}} first time. I do not know but that they may startle us now, often <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> them, if <b>we</b> think seriously over them. That God should appear to mortal man, and speak with mortal man. It is most wonderful. It is utterly unlike {{anything}} that we have ever seen, or that any person on earth has seen, for many hundred years. It is a miracle, {{in every sense of the}} word.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{started as}} soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> of your trouble," [...] said Muriel. [...] "We were in Mexico then, {{and as we}} had moved about a good deal there was some delay in our letters. Has your father decided {{to stay with the}} Leslies?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'On that point, fortunately, we {{have not}} got to consult him, Ned--Dorothy has {{definitely}} broken off the engagement. As soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> from Gilliat of the robbery, she declared that it was positively impossible that the matter should go on, and I quite agreed with her decision.' ...|$|E
60|$|So {{we passed}} the curtain, and stood upon the portico, looking at the garden misty with moonlight, and talking of this and that--about the Israelites, I think, who, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard,</b> were {{wandering}} in the deserts of Sinai. Then {{of a sudden we}} grew silent, both of us.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] I answered, [...] "I do not. Nevertheless, I {{must confess}} that strange, unaccountable sounds, such <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have just <b>heard,</b> {{make me feel}} a little uneasy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{we shall}} have to keep our eyes open, Mike," [...] he said. [...] "So far <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard,</b> there are no bodies of the enemy's troops {{anywhere}} in this neighbourhood, {{but there is a}} bitter enmity between the Spanish and Portuguese, and we shall be liable to be attacked by the peasants." ...|$|R
6000|$|Pierre lost {{no time in}} {{explaining}} to Uncle 'Rasmus the moaning of those dull yet heavy reports which could be heard from the distance, {{and when he was}} done with the story <b>as</b> <b>we</b> had <b>heard</b> it from the Britishers, the old negro said placidly, as if the matter did not affect him in the slightest: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was out in}} South Africa {{during the}} Boer War, sir," [...] Parkins replied, [...] "and I went big game hunting with my master afterwards. I {{do not think that}} any animal was ever born in Africa with so terrifying a cry <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> the night before last." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> of it we all {{set off on}} a bear-hunt. It was jolly fun, {{although}} I did {{not so much as}} catch a {{sight of}} him. Father shot him at a three-hundred-foot range. It was a Winchester rifle with a thirty-two cartridge. It was a beautiful shot, Walter said, and I wish I had made it.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I {{wanted to}} go out as soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> that murder had been done; but mother wouldn't listen to me. It was only by {{promising}} to come directly here, and have you walk home with me, that she was willing I should venture out now. The streets are filled with people, and the excitement is as great as at noonday." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{said that}} the geologists called these beds the Trias; that is, the triple group. But <b>as</b> yet <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> of only two parts of it. [...] Where is the third? ...|$|R
6000|$|Idly {{he opened}} the telegram--it was from his lawyers: [...] "Your cousin, the child George Bingham, is, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have just <b>heard,</b> dead. Please call on us early to-morrow morning." ...|$|R
60|$|For some {{seconds after}} he had spoken into the {{darkness}} there was a dead silence in it. Then there came a kind of muttering and moaning. We might easily have taken it for the wind or rats {{if we had not}} happened to have heard it before. It was unmistakably the voice of the imprisoned woman, drearily demanding liberty, just <b>as</b> <b>we</b> had <b>heard</b> her demand it.|$|R
6000|$|... "As for {{the place}} itself, it is, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard,</b> of no great strength. 'Tis but a modern house, {{inclosed}} on three sides with a wall some twenty feet high, and surrounded by a moat of the same width. With our force we should carry it in half an hour. We know that the garrison consists of only fifty men, besides a score or so of grooms and servants." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> of {{the call}} we offered him ten {{thousand}} three hundred--not that that would {{make any difference to}} a man of his character. Indeed Dumfarthing was still waiting and looking for guidance when they offered him eleven thousand. We couldn't meet it. It was beyond us, though we had the consolation of knowing that with such a man as Dumfarthing the money made no difference." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{ground was}} still covered with snow, though not so deep and {{dangerous}} {{as on the}} mountains; and the ravenous creatures, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> afterwards, were come down into the forest and plain country, pressed by hunger, to seek for food, and had done {{a great deal of}} mischief in the villages, where they surprised the country-people, killed a great many of their sheep and horses, and some people too.|$|E
60|$|As we {{approached}} {{the mouth of the}} East Branch we passed two or three huts, the first sign of civilization after Hunt's, though we saw no road <b>as</b> yet. <b>We</b> <b>heard</b> a cowbell, and even saw an infant held up to a small square window to see us pass. On entering the West Branch at Nicketow, Polis remarked that it was all smooth water hence to Oldtown, and he threw away his pole which was cut on the Umbazookskus.|$|R
60|$|That musicale at the White House {{is one of}} {{the starry}} nights in Zulime's life, as well as in my own, for not only did we meet the President and Mrs. Roosevelt and many of the best known figures in American art, letters, politics, and statesmanship, <b>we</b> also <b>heard</b> Paderewski play <b>as</b> <b>we</b> had never <b>heard</b> him play before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Allen {{went off}} {{yesterday}} afternoon, and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have not <b>heard</b> from him since, {{we are getting}} anxious," [...] put in Chet. [...] "We would have followed, but we haven't a single beast left in the barn." ...|$|R
