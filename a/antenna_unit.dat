Positioning means not only setting a correct direction or azimuth, but setting a correct downtilt as well. By restricting emitted energy to a sub-circular arc and narrow vertical coverage the design makes efficient use of relatively low power transmitter equipment. Though absolute range is limited, this configuration allows for good data rates (digital information transfer measured in bits/second, sometimes given as total minus error-correction overhead), and good signal consistency within the coverage area.|$|E

5000|$|While {{the film}} remains ambiguous, {{one can see}} {{evidence}} in the film that since HAL was instructed to deceive the mission astronauts as to the actual nature of the mission and that deception opens a Pandora's box of possibilities. During a game of chess, although easily victorious over Frank Poole, HAL makes a subtle mistake {{in the use of}} descriptive notation to describe a move, and when describing a forced mate, fails to mention moves that Poole could make to delay defeat. Poole is seen to be mouthing his moves to himself during the game and it is later revealed that HAL can lip read. HAL's conversation with Dave Bowman just before the diagnostic error of the AE-35 unit that communicates with Earth is an almost paranoid question and answer session ("Surely one could not be unaware of the strange stories circulating...rumors about something being dug up on the moon...") where HAL skirts very close to the pivotal issue concerning which he is concealing information. When Dave states [...] "You're working up your crew psychology report," [...] HAL takes a few seconds to respond in the affirmative. Immediately following this exchange, he errs in diagnosing the <b>antenna</b> <b>unit.</b> HAL has been introduced to the unique and alien concept of human dishonesty.

40|$|A {{distributed}} antenna system, where the antennas of a base station are spatially {{distributed throughout the}} cell, can achieve better throughput at the cell edge than a centralized antenna system.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a novel Medium-Transparent MAC (MT-MAC) protocol with enhanced end-user service delivery fairness properties {{for use in}} Gbps capable, 60 GHz Fiber-Wireless (FiWi) LAN networks. Our approach relies on incorporating a Client Weighted Algorithm (CWA) in the optical capacity allocation mechanism employed in the MT-MAC scheme, so as to distribute the available wavelengths to the different <b>antenna</b> <b>units</b> according to {{the total number of}} active users served by each individual antenna. The protocol's throughput fairness characteristics are confirmed through extensive simulations for different end-user's distributions, vaying traffic loads and multiple optical wavelength availabilities at 1 Gbps data rates. The presented results shoe that complete throughput and delay equalization can be achieved even for highly varying user population patterns among the different <b>antenna</b> <b>units</b> when certain wavelength availability conditions are satisfied. The performance of the proposed protocol has been compared with respective results obtained by the state-of-art MT-MAC scheme where a round-robin arbitration algorithm is used, clearly confirming the increased fairness capabilities of our approach.

We consider a high-speed backhaul network where the remote antenna units are transparently linked by optical fiber to a central unit. In the considered architecture we can assume {{the knowledge of the}} data and channel state information of all users, at the central unit. The precoder design is divided in two phases: first a solution based on minimization of bit-error-rate is computed by assuming that all remote antenna units can jointly pool their power, i. e., a total power constraint is imposed instead of a per remote <b>antenna</b> <b>unit</b> power constraint; the second phase consists in scaling the obtained transmit signal by a factor to satisfy the individual per remote <b>antenna</b> <b>unit</b> power constraint.
