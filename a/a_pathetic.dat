5|$|Gabriel García Márquez's The General in His Labyrinth (El general en su laberinto, 1989) is a fictionalized {{account of}} the last days {{in the life of}} Simón Bolívar. Bolívar, also known as the Great Liberator, freed from Spanish rule the {{territory}} that would subsequently become Venezuela, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador. However the character of the General is not portrayed as the glorious hero that traditional history has presented; instead García Márquez develops <b>a</b> <b>pathetic</b> protagonist, a prematurely aged man who is physically ill and mentally exhausted.|$|E
25|$|In Skíðaríma, the war {{threatens to}} destroy Valhalla itself, and so Odin sends Thor to fetch Skíði, <b>a</b> <b>pathetic</b> beggar, {{so that he}} can stop the war. Skíði manages to stop the fight by asking to marry Hildr and she consents.|$|E
25|$|Another of Beyond the Black Rainbows main themes is identity. Over {{the course}} of the movie Dr. Nyle {{experiences}} a radical change of personality whose roots lie in the terrifying drug experience he had in 1966, under Mercurio Arboria's supervision. Being exposed to his shadow side so intensely crippled not only his mind, but his body: Barry is forced to use appliances such as a wig and contact lenses. Similar to many a Lovecraftian protagonist, Barry Nyle is ultimately <b>a</b> <b>pathetic</b> character: his far-reaching knowledge, restrained demeanor and carefully controlled work environment are unable to dominate the forces of irrationality and chaos burning in his mind. In the end, the doctor undergoes a physical and psychological transformation where he forfeits all control and gives in to madness.|$|E

25|$|Series 8 and 9 {{featured}} Bodger and Badger {{running a}} Bed & Breakfast {{hotel in the}} fictional seaside town of Puddleford (location filming for series 8 and 9 took place around Brighton). Various guests stayed at the hotel {{over the course of}} the two series and again Bodger kept Badger's presence a secret from all of them. Guests included two Spanish flamenco dancers, Miss Peake (a bad-tempered school teacher), Mr Tucknott (a dim-witted bank manager), the bubbly Mrs Bobbins, Miss Piper (a mad old woman) and Mr Wilson (<b>a</b> <b>pathetic</b> trainee bank manager). In Series 8 the characters of Millie the Milkwoman and China the dog were introduced, who featured in the show until the very end. Millie was friends with Bodger and knew about Badger, as he was friends with her dog, China. Series 8 also featured the return of Mr Smart, as he ran the B next door to Bodger's. Smart never seemed to have any guests staying at his hotel and was always trying to steal Bodger's. This was the first series to utilise the 1997 BBC logo and the last series to use the pink background for its title card and end credits.|$|E
25|$|In October, when {{schemes for}} marrying Mary to an English nobleman were under consideration, Knollys {{proposed}} that his wife's nephew, George Carey, might prove a suitable match. In November the inquiry into Mary's misdeeds which had begun at York, was reopened at Westminster, and Knollys {{pointed out that}} he needed a larger company of retainers to keep his prisoner safe from a possible attempt at rescue. In December he was directed by Elizabeth to induce Mary to assent to her abdication of the Scottish throne. In January 1569 he plainly told Elizabeth that, in declining to allow Mary either to be condemned or to be acquitted on the charges brought against her, she was inviting perils which were likely to overwhelm her, and entreated her to leave the decision of Mary's fate to her well-tried councillors. On 20 January orders arrived at Bolton to transfer Mary to Tutbury, where the Earl of Shrewsbury was {{to take charge of}} her. Against the removal the Scottish queen protested in <b>a</b> <b>pathetic</b> note to Knollys, intended for Elizabeth's eye, but next day she was forced to leave Bolton, and Knollys remained with her at Tutbury till 3 February. His wife's death then called him home. Mary blamed Elizabeth for the fatal termination of Lady Knollys' illness, attributing it to her husband's enforced absence in the north.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Groening {{got into}} a major {{disagreement}} with Brooks and other Simpsons producers over [...] "A Star Is Burns", a crossover episode with The Critic, an animated show also produced by Brooks and staffed with many former Simpsons crew members. Groening claimed that he feared viewers would [...] "see it as nothing but <b>a</b> <b>pathetic</b> attempt to advertise The Critic {{at the expense of}} The Simpsons," [...] and was concerned about the possible implication that he had created or produced The Critic. He requested his name be taken off the episode.|$|E

500|$|The song, {{according}} to Joel, is an anti-drug song. He says, [...] "What's so horrible about an affluent young white teenager's life that he's got to shoot heroin? It's really {{a song about}} what I consider to be <b>a</b> <b>pathetic</b> loser kind of lifestyle. I've been accused of, 'Oh, this song promotes drug use and masturbation.' No, no, no. Listen to the song. This guy is a loser." [...] In writing about the song in the liner notes of his Songs in the Attic album, Joel once again emphasized the point: [...] "...so many friends shoveled under the Long Island dirt. The miracle of modern chemistry killed them if Vietnam didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|Olivier and Esmond {{married on}} 25 July 1930 at All Saints, Margaret Street, {{although}} within weeks both realised they had erred. Olivier later recorded {{that the marriage}} was [...] "a pretty crass mistake. I insisted on getting married from <b>a</b> <b>pathetic</b> mixture of religious and animal promptings.... She had admitted {{to me that she}} was in love elsewhere and could never love me as completely as I would wish". Olivier later recounted that following the wedding he did not keep a diary for ten years and never followed religious practices again, although he considered those facts to be [...] "mere coincidence", unconnected to the nuptials.|$|E
500|$|Dibnah met {{his second}} wife Susan Lorenz—a 28-year-old administrator—at a steam rally in Cheshire. [...] In The Fred Dibnah Story (1996) she {{recalled}} their first meeting: [...] "He looked sad and miserable, quite <b>a</b> <b>pathetic</b> sort of figure really, none of the bounce that people knew him for." [...] He later invited her to a chimney felling in Oldham and then a talk he {{had been invited to}} give to a group of fans in Halifax, known as The Fred Dibnah Appreciation Society. [...] Sue moved into Dibnah's home in Bolton and the two [...] married on 27February 1987. [...] She encouraged him to grow a moustache and also to give up smoking.|$|E

At {{the end of the}} day, Michael promotes Dwight from his lowly [...] "Assistant to the Regional Manager" [...] position to his dream position: [...] "Assistant Regional Manager" [...] (although the [...] "promotion" [...] {{is little more than a}} title change only). However, this was done most likely to ensure that Dwight will still idolize him despite the hard feelings over their lunchtime battle. The rest of the staff, fed up with Michael's inability to accomplish even the simplest task, are forced to forge his signature on all the documents and get home.|$|E
500|$|Eiland-Hall {{retained}} First Amendment {{rights lawyer}} Marc Randazza to represent him. According to Randazza, Eiland-Hall sought legal representation {{after he was}} contacted with legal requests from lawyers representing Beck. On September 28, 2009 Randazza filed a 17-page response brief {{on behalf of his}} client, asserting that the website's domain name was a form of protected political speech and satirical political humor. According to Randazza, the website was used for satirical purposes and its owner was not attempting to profit from it. Randazza wrote that an individual would have to be <b>a</b> <b>pathetic</b> idiot to come under the impression that his client's website was directly affiliated with Beck, contending that the website's domain name could not be confused with the [...] "Glenn Beck" [...] trademark except to [...] "a moron in a hurry".|$|E
500|$|The General in His Labyrinth (original Spanish title: [...] ) is a {{novel by}} the Colombian writer and Nobel laureate Gabriel García Márquez. It is a fictionalized account of {{the last days of}} Simón Bolívar, liberator and leader of Gran Colombia. First {{published}} in 1989, the book traces Bolívar's final journey from Bogotá to the Caribbean coastline of Colombia in his attempt to leave South America for exile in Europe. In this dictator novel about a continental hero, [...] "despair, sickness, and death inevitably win out over love, health, and life". Breaking with the traditional heroic portrayal of Bolívar , García Márquez depicts <b>a</b> <b>pathetic</b> protagonist, a prematurely aged man who is physically ill and mentally exhausted. The story explores the labyrinth of Bolívar's life through the narrative of his memories.|$|E

500|$|The revived Doctor Who {{series was}} to feature a script by Stephen Fry, {{set in the}} 1920s. Rumours {{appeared}} on the BBC's websites shortly after the airing of the new Series 1 and the story was pencilled in as the eleventh episode of Series 2. According to a video diary entry by David Tennant, Fry attended the very first cast read-through for Series 2, indicating that his script was still under consideration at that point. Due to budgetary constraints, the episode was moved to Series 3 and replaced by Fear Her. The story was subsequently abandoned, as Fry did not have spare time for the rewriting necessary to replace Rose with Martha. Fry said, [...] "They {{asked me to do}} a series and I tried, but I just ran out of time, and so I wrote <b>a</b> <b>pathetic</b> letter of [...] "I'm sorry I can't do this" [...] to Davies." ...|$|E
500|$|Keith Waterhouse's Mrs Pooter's Diary of 1983 is an {{adaptation}} of the Grossmith original that shifts the narrative voice to Carrie Pooter. In 1996 Helen Fielding used the imaginary diary format for Bridget Jones's Diary, which records the daily paraphernalia of a single woman's life. The New York Times critic wrote that it [...] "captures neatly the way modern women teeter between 'I am woman' independence and <b>a</b> <b>pathetic</b> girlie desire to {{be all things to}} all men." [...] This diary began as a weekly column in The Independent, and was later published in books which sold more than 15 million copies in 40 countries. In the 1990s the satirical magazine Private Eye lampooned John Major, British prime minister 1990–97, in [...] "The Secret Diary of John Major aged 47", a hybrid of the Adrian Mole diaries with The Diary of a Nobody, which made much fun of Major's lower-middle class origins.|$|E
500|$|King Stephen {{wasted no}} time to solidify his {{relations}} with the Holy See. He sent <b>a</b> <b>pathetic</b> plea to Pope Pius, asking him to send bishops, crusading weapons, and a coronation crown, {{as well as to}} be recommended to Matthias Corvinus. Stephen hoped that, with the Pope's urging, the Hungarian king would agree to provide him with military aid. On 17 November, the feast of Saint Gregory Thaumaturgus, who had been proclaimed [...] "Defender of Bosnia" [...] at royal request, the papal legate and newly appointed bishop Nicholas of Modruš crowned Stephen in the Church of Saint Mary in Jajce. It was the last coronation performed in Bosnia, as well as the only one performed with a crown sent from Rome. It exemplified how, with the religious persecution established by Thomas and with Stephen's active correspondence with the papacy, the Kingdom of Bosnia acquired the character of a true Catholic state only at its very end.|$|E

Metcalfe told an Inside Soap reporter that this left Mercedes [...] "devastated" [...] as she has [...] "built up the courage to go through with it". Metcalfe went onto tease that things will get [...] "darker" [...] for her character. Mercedes became depressed and her sister Jacqui decided to help her. Mercedes attempted to seduce Jacqui's husband Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss), who told Jacqui. Cooper said Jacqui [...] "knows what state of mind" [...] Mercedes was in and [...] "lays into" [...] Mercedes, who revealed she has been working as a prostitute. Cooper explained Jacqui's reaction is [...] "pretty harsh" [...] and that she thought Mercedes was a [...] "promiscuous tart and <b>a</b> <b>pathetic</b> excuse for a woman" [...] with [...] "no morals". Cooper said Jacqui had [...] "given Mercedes chance after chance, and feels that she doesn't deserve anything more".|$|E
500|$|... "You're Killing Me", {{the longest}} {{song on the}} EP at three minutes and 20 seconds, {{is an example of}} the impact punk rock had on Pavement. The song {{features}} fuzz effects, repetitive lyrics, and no percussion or drums. [...] "Box Elder", an ironic song about someone wanting to move to Box Elder, Montana, was considered by Gerard Cosloy to be an example of Malkmus's [...] "honest, direct, and simplistic" [...] lyrical style, and features greater influence from pop music than the rest of the EP. [...] "Maybe Maybe" [...] features distorted guitars and indiscernible vocals, and [...] "Price Yeah!" [...] has a sound typical of hardcore punk. The band's hometown of Stockton inspired the band's lyrics and sound. Malkmus stated that [...] "There's something empty about Stockton. I wanted to convey that in our music." [...] Malkmus told Melody Maker in 1992 that [...] "Pavement was originally <b>a</b> <b>pathetic</b> effort by us to do something to escape the terminal boredom we were experiencing in Stockton." ...|$|E
500|$|After the match, {{figures from}} each team were {{critical}} of the other team's play. Liverpool defender Tommy Smith criticised Brugge for their approach, saying [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>pathetic</b> attitude. You never win anything like that." [...] Liverpool manager Bob Paisley also criticised the Belgian team's tactics: [...] "It takes two teams to make a game into a spectacle and Bruges only seemed {{to be concerned with}} keeping the score down. Bruges didn't come at us much – apart from one mistake in our defence, they never looked like scoring. But they were well organised at the back and {{it was a case of}} breaking them down. We controlled the game from start to finish." [...] Meanwhile, Club Brugge manager Ernst Happel was {{critical of the}} quality of the Liverpool team: [...] "Liverpool seemed only a shadow of the side we played in the UEFA Cup final two seasons ago. I was disappointed with them, but they deserved their victory although we were handicapped by injuries to two players." ...|$|E
