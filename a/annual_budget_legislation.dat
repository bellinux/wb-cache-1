There is a comprehensive legal and administrative framework for management of budget resources. The Budget systems law contains an explicit commitment to an open and transparent budget process, and budget coverage improved considerably with the inclusion of five major extrabudgetary funds into the budget in 1998.

The design {{of these systems}} varies considerably across countries, reflecting differences in priorities, country capacities, and political traditions. The paper develops a generic value chain for a treasury system and discusses the choices that are made in designing that system. The paper provides an indicative set of good practices for treasury design in different groups of countries. The generic model and the proposed good practices are compared to the actual treasury systems in seven countries.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{issues relating}} to the establishment and financial management of extrabudgetary funds (EBFs), {{a large group of}} government entities that on average accounts for 40 to 45 percent of central government expenditure-two-thirds of which represents social security funds-in countries at various stages of development. If improperly designed and managed, EBFs can undermine effective fiscal control. However, they also bring potential benefits in the form of greater autonomy of decision-making in countries with well-established governance and financial management systems that have applied the "agency model" of devolved public management and fiscal control. The paper develops a typology of EBFs and argues that EBFs are frequently created because of failures in the budget system and political economy factors that need to be recognized and, where possible, corrected. The paper recommends that data on EBFs be consolidated within a unified system of fiscal reporting and proposes an analytical framework that governments might use to evaluate the effectiveness and utility of their EBFs.

Electoral and voting systems, bicameralism, constitutional and legal constraints, voluntary contracts of political parties, and long-standing traditions all influence the relative budgetary powers of executives and legislatures. Differences in the legislature''s budgetary authority in twenty-eight countries with five different forms of government are examined. It is concluded that differences in budgetary powers within a particular form of government are as great as those between different forms of government.
