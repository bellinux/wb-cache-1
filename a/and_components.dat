5|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} metabolism is {{the similarity of}} the basic metabolic pathways <b>and</b> <b>components</b> between even vastly different species. For example, the set of carboxylic acids that are {{best known as the}} intermediates in the citric acid cycle are present in all known organisms, being found in species as diverse as the unicellular bacterium Escherichia coli and huge multicellular organisms like elephants. These striking similarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance in evolutionary history, and their retention because of their efficacy.|$|E

40|$|Intensive crop {{breeding}} {{has increased}} wheat yields and production in India. Wheat improvement in India typically involves selecting yield <b>and</b> <b>component</b> traits under non-hostile soil conditions at regional scales. The {{aim of this}} study is to quantify G*E interactions on yield <b>and</b> <b>component</b> traits to further explore site-specific trait selection for hostile soils. Field experiments were conducted at six sites (pH range 4. 5 - 9. 5) in 2013 - 14 and 2014 - 15, in three agro-climatic regions of India. At each site, yield <b>and</b> <b>component</b> traits were measured on 36 genotypes, representing elite varieties from a wide genetic background developed for different regions. Mean grain yields ranged from 1. 0 to 5. 5 t ha- 1 at hostile and non-hostile sites, respectively. Site (E) had the largest effect on yield <b>and</b> <b>component</b> traits, however, interactions between genotype and site (G*E) affected most traits to a greater extent than genotype alone. Within each agro-climatic region, yield <b>and</b> <b>component</b> traits correlated positively between hostile and non-hostile sites. However, some genotypes performed better under hostile soils, with site-specific relationships between yield <b>and</b> <b>component</b> traits, which supports the value of ongoing site-specific selection activities...|$|R

5|$|Beryllium {{improves}} many {{physical properties}} when added as an alloying element to aluminium, copper (notably the alloy beryllium copper), iron and nickel. Beryllium does not form oxides {{until it reaches}} very high temperatures. Tools made of beryllium copper alloys are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface. In structural applications, the combination of high flexural rigidity, thermal stability, thermal conductivity and low density (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium metal a desirable aerospace material for aircraft components, missiles, spacecraft, and satellites. Because of its low density and atomic mass, beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays {{and other forms of}} ionizing radiation; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment <b>and</b> <b>components</b> of particle detectors. The high thermal conductivities of beryllium and beryllium oxide have led to their use in thermal management applications.|$|E

The tablets, like the pectorals, statuettes, and staves, were works of art and valued possessions, and were apparently given individual proper names {{in the same manner}} as jade ornaments in New Zealand. Two of the tablets, C and S, have a documented pre-missionary provenance, though others may be as old or older. There are in addition a few isolated glyphs or short sequences which might prove to be rongorongo.|$|E

5|$|Catabolism is {{the set of}} {{metabolic}} {{processes that}} break down large molecules. These include breaking down and oxidizing food molecules. The purpose of the catabolic reactions is to provide the energy <b>and</b> <b>components</b> needed by anabolic reactions which build molecules. The exact nature of these catabolic reactions differ from organism to organism, and organisms can be classified based on their sources of energy and carbon (their primary nutritional groups), {{as shown in the}} table below. Organic molecules are used as a source of energy by organotrophs, while lithotrophs use inorganic substrates, and phototrophs capture sunlight as chemical energy. However, all these different forms of metabolism depend on redox reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from reduced donor molecules such as organic molecules, water, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide or ferrous ions to acceptor molecules such as oxygen, nitrate or sulfate. In animals, these reactions involve complex organic molecules that are broken down to simpler molecules, such as carbon dioxide and water. In photosynthetic organisms, such as plants and cyanobacteria, these electron-transfer reactions do not release energy but are used as a way of storing energy absorbed from sunlight.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1945 {{he became}} Professor of Physics at the University of Melbourne vice Laby, a {{position}} he held until 1959. He built up a nuclear physics research school {{at a time when}} Australian universities were only just beginning to award PhDs, and most research students went abroad to pursue their studies. He attempted to equip it as best as his limited funds would allow. Wherever possible, equipment and parts were built by staff and students. His cosmic ray group participated in the 1947–48 Antarctic expedition of , and he designed and built a 200 kV neutron generator and a 1 MeV Van de Graaff generator. A 3 MeV betatron was converted an 18 MeV electron synchrotron in 1948. A 5 to 12 MeV cyclotron was the largest machine built at the University up to that time. Design work began in 1953, and it commenced operation in 1957, running until 1976. Martin did not have the money to build it, but managed to scrounge funding <b>and</b> <b>components</b> from various sources. Although he was an experimental physicist, he created a theoretical physics group under Courtney Mohr. He also managed to persuade the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) to transfer CSIRAC, Australia's first digital electronic computer, to the School of Physics in 1955, creating the first academic computing facility in Australia, and the beginning of computer science at the University of Melbourne.|$|E
