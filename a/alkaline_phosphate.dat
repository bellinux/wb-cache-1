5000|$|Elevated {{alkaline}} phosphatase describes {{the situation where}} the levels of {{alkaline phosphatase}} [...] (ALP) exceed the reference range. This group of enzymes has a low substrate specificity and catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphate esters in a basic environment. The major function of alkaline phosphatase is transporting across cell membranes. Alkaline phosphatases are present in many human tissues, including bone, intestine, kidney, liver, placenta and white blood cells. Damage to these tissues causes the release of ALP into the bloodstream. Elevated levels can be detected through a blood test.

Cytotoxicity of GNPs and Saffron extract was measured by MTT assay (3 - 4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide). Samples were divided to 3 experimental groups and were treated with GNPs (20 µg/ml), Saffron extract (400 µg/ml), and a combination of Saffron extract and GNPs (400 and 20 µg/ml respectively).

30|$|A {{decrease}} in the lineage commitment of multipotent Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to the bone forming osteoblast lineage {{and an increase in}} the commitment to the fat forming adipocyte lineage is more common in bone marrow of elderly persons. A link between methylation status and MSC differentiation remains unclear. Therefore, we hypothesize that hypomethylation may decide the fate decisions of MSC. In the current study, murine bone marrow derived-C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 stem cell was used to examine the role of methylation mechanism on the differentiation potential of stem cells into osteoblasts or adipocytes. C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells were treated with Periodate oxidized adenosine (Adox), an inhibitor of S-adenosylhomocysteine-dependent hydrolase (SAHH), which in turn block the non-DNA methylation pathway. The effect of hypomethylation on C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 stem cell differentiation was determined by measuring the <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphates</b> activity and the degree of mineralization as well as Oil-red O staining and lipid content. The ratio of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) was determined as a metabolic indicator of cellular methylation potential.
