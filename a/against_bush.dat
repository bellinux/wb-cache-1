25|$|At {{the end of}} August 1929, Bush {{suddenly}} {{resigned as}} the Pirates' manager.

25|$|During 2004, Democratic National Committee {{chairman}} Terry McAuliffe {{and others}} accused Bush of being absent without leave (AWOL) from the Air National Guard in 1972–73.

25|$|Bentsen's {{campaign}} and {{his reputation as}} a centrist Democrat served to alienate him not only from supporters of Yarborough, but from prominent national liberals, as well. Indeed, during the 1970 Senate race, the Keynesian economist John Kenneth Galbraith endorsed the Republican candidate, then U.S. Representative and future presidentGeorge H. W. Bush, arguing that if Bentsen were elected to the Senate, he would invariably become the face of a new, more moderate-to-conservative Texas Democratic Party and that the long-term interests of Texas liberalism demanded Bentsen's defeat. Nevertheless, Bentsen convincingly won the general election <b>against</b> <b>Bush.</b>|$|E

During the 2004 United States presidential election, the band was part of Punkvoter, a political activist group, and appeared on the Rock <b>Against</b> <b>Bush,</b> Vol. 1 compilation. The Rock <b>Against</b> <b>Bush</b> project raised over $1 million for then presidential candidate John Kerry. [...] During the 2008 presidential election, the band members endorsed Barack Obama.

500|$|Bush's {{approval}} rating went below the 50percent mark in AP-Ipsos polling in December 2004. Thereafter, his {{approval rating}}s and approval of {{his handling of}} {{domestic and foreign policy}} issues steadily dropped. Bush received heavy criticism for his handling of the Iraq War, his response to Hurricane Katrina and to the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse, NSA warrantless surveillance, the Plame affair, and Guantanamo Bay detention camp controversies. There were calls for Bush's impeachment, though most polls showed a plurality of Americans would not support such an action. The arguments offered for impeachment usually centered on the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy, the Bush administration's justification for the war in Iraq, and alleged violations of the Geneva Conventions. Representative Dennis Kucinich (D-OH), who had run <b>against</b> <b>Bush</b> during the 2004 presidential campaign, introduced 35 articles of impeachment {{on the floor of the}} House of Representatives <b>against</b> <b>Bush</b> on June 9, 2008, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) declared that impeachment was [...] "off the table".|$|E

500|$|... "Give It All" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{rock band}} Rise Against. It was {{originally}} recorded for the 2004 compilation album Rock <b>Against</b> <b>Bush,</b> Vol. 1, while a slightly altered version appeared on the band's third studio album Siren Song of the Counter Culture later that year. It is a hardcore punk song, with lyrics that are about [...] "being a punk rocker in today's world," [...] according to lead vocalist Tim McIlrath. It was released as Siren Song of the Counter Culture first single in October 2004.|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} {{several years}} as an underground band, in which they released two albums with Fat Wreck Chords, Rise Against signed a recording contract with Geffen Records in 2003. This deal was criticized by some fans, who felt that a major record label would hinder the band's creative process and negatively impact their music. The first song the band released following their signing to Geffen was [...] "Give It All", which was featured on the 2004 compilation album Rock <b>Against</b> <b>Bush,</b> Vol. 1. The band liked the song, and decided to record a slightly altered version for their third studio album Siren Song of the Counter Culture later that year.|$|E
500|$|Bush mobilized the state's evangelical voters, {{and leading}} {{conservative}} broadcaster Rush Limbaugh entered the fray supporting Bush {{and going on}} at length about how McCain was a favorite of liberal Democrats. [...] Polls swung in Bush's favor; by not accepting federal matching funds for his campaign, Bush was not limited in {{how much money he}} could spend on advertisements, while McCain was near his limit. [...] With three days to go, McCain shut down his negative ads <b>against</b> <b>Bush</b> and tried to stress a positive image. [...] But McCain's unconstitutional campaign finance law, line item veto, suing HMO and McCain opposed tax cuts, did not appeal to core Republicans in the state.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{restrictions}} of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution, incumbent President Ronald Reagan was not eligible {{to seek a}} third term. Running an aggressive campaign, Bush capitalized on a good economy and Reagan's popularity. Meanwhile, Dukakis's campaign suffered from several miscues, including failure to defend <b>against</b> <b>Bush's</b> attacks. This allowed Bush to win with a substantial margin of the popular vote, while winning the Electoral College by a landslide. Since the 1988 election, no candidate has managed to equal or surpass Bush's number of electoral votes won or popular vote percentage.|$|R
25|$|On November 3, Bill Clinton won the {{election}} {{to serve as the}} 42nd President of the United States by a wide margin in the Electoral College, receiving 43% of the popular vote <b>against</b> <b>Bush's</b> 37.5% and Perot's 18.9%. It was the first time since 1968 that a candidate won the White House with under 50% of the popular vote. Only Washington, D.C. and Clinton's home state of Arkansas gave the majority of their votes to a single candidate in the entire country; the rest were won by pluralities of the vote.|$|R
500|$|... "Give It All" [...] {{is a short}} {{hardcore}} punk track, with a {{fast pace}} and a slow bridge. Lead vocalist Tim McIlrath commented that the song is [...] "kind of a punk rock anthem about being a punk rocker in today’s world; like what being a human being in today’s world is like." [...] Scott Heisel of Punknews.org felt that the Rock <b>Against</b> <b>Bush,</b> Vol. 1 version maintained the band's distinctive sound, and signing to a major record label had not changed the band's music. Davey Boy of Sputnikmusic noted that the Siren Song of the Counter Culture version {{reminded him of a}} harder version of songs by the Offspring, and that it was controlled enough to appeal to casual rock fans.|$|E
2500|$|NOFX {{released}} its ninth studio album The War on Errorism in 2003, {{an album of}} political songs. It became the start of its anti-George W. Bush campaign. Fat Mike organized the website punkvoter.com, compiled two chart-topping Rock <b>Against</b> <b>Bush</b> albums, and started a Rock <b>Against</b> <b>Bush</b> U.S. tour.

50|$|Bush's {{confirmation}} as the Director of Central Intelligence {{was opposed}} by many politicians and citizens {{who were still}} reeling from the Watergate scandal (when Bush {{was the head of the}} Republican National Committee, and a steadfast defender of Nixon) and the Church Committee investigations. Many arguments <b>against</b> <b>Bush's</b> initial confirmation were that he was too partisan for the office. The Washington Post, George Will, and Senator Frank Church were some notable figures opposed to Bush's nomination. After a pledge by Bush not to run for either President or Vice-President in 1976, opposition to his nomination died down.|$|R
2500|$|As Ocean Avenues {{popularity}} {{began to}} decrease, Yellowcard {{spent some time}} contributing songs to various other soundtracks.
