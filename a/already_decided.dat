5|$|In September 1923, Democratic gubernatorial nominee J. Campbell Cantrill died, {{leaving the}} party without a candidate. Alben Barkley, who Cantrill had {{defeated}} for the nomination, {{refused to be}} the Democratic candidate, perhaps because he had <b>already</b> <b>decided</b> {{to run for the}} U.S. Senate in 1926. The Democratic Central Committee chose Fields as a replacement for Cantrill.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{he arrived}} home, Etty began to work on {{ensuring}} he {{had at least one}} picture ready for the 1824 Summer Exhibition. He decided to return to a theme for which he had created a sketch in 1820, that of the story of Pandora and in particular the passage in Hesiod in which the seasons crown her with a wreath. He had exhibited a sketch in 1820 on the same theme, and had <b>already</b> <b>decided</b> on the arrangement of the figures. His first attempt in 1824 was abandoned half-finished, and he began again on a smaller canvas with different positioning of the key figures of Pandora, Vulcan and Venus.|$|E
5|$|Karasahr was besieged in 644 by Guo. Tang forces {{defeated}} the kingdom, captured the king, and a pro-Tang {{member of the}} royal family was enthroned as ruler. The new king was deposed by the Western Turks soon afterwards, and the Western Turks regained suzerainty over Karasahr. Suvarnadeva died between 646 and 648, and his brother Haripushpa (Chinese: Helibushibi) inherited the throne as Kucha's king. Although Haripushpa sent two tribute embassies to the Tang court, Tang Taizong had <b>already</b> <b>decided</b> to punish Kucha's pro-Turk stance by launching an expedition against the kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Mary, {{also known}} as Maria (14 April 137117 May 1395), reigned as Queen of Hungary and Croatia between 1382 and 1385, and from 1386 until her death. She was the {{daughter}} of Louis the Great, King of Hungary and Poland, and his wife, Elizabeth of Bosnia. Mary's marriage to Sigismund of Luxembourg, a member of the imperial Luxembourg dynasty, was <b>already</b> <b>decided</b> before her first birthday. A delegation of Polish prelates and lords confirmed her right to succeed her father in Poland in 1379.|$|E
5|$|The Allies had <b>already</b> <b>decided</b> {{to mount}} an {{invasion}} of southern France (Dragoon), which occurred in August 1944. Vendetta's story was agreed {{in the first week}} of May and deception work started on 9 May. Its aim was to detain German forces in Southern France for up to twenty five days following the Normandy landings. The plan threatened a landing near Sete (chosen for its distance from the Dragoon landing site) by the US Seventh Army, consisting of fictional divisions, and some French units. Vendetta was supported by a diplomatic deception, Operation Royal Flush, which requested support from the Spanish government to allow injured soldiers to be evacuated following an invasion.|$|E
5|$|The Cabildo met at 9am and {{rejected}} Cisneros' resignation. They considered that {{the crowd had}} no legitimate right to influence something that the Cabildo had <b>already</b> <b>decided</b> and implemented. They considered that, as the Junta was in command, the demonstration should be suppressed by force, and made the members responsible for any changes to {{the resolution of the}} previous day. To enforce those orders, they summoned the chief commanders, but these did not obey. Many of them, including Saavedra, did not appear. Those that did stated that they could not support the government order, and that the commanders would be disobeyed if they ordered the troops to repress the demonstrators.|$|E
50|$|Robinson made four {{appearances}} for Watford in the 2008-09 season, {{but was not}} in {{new manager}} Brendan Rodgers's first team plan's, who replaced Boothroyd as manager in November. On 24 January 2009, Robinson joined League One side Southend United on loan {{until the end of}} the 2008-09 season. He formed an effective strike partnership with Lee Barnard and impressed manager Steve Tilson with his performances. Tilson made a bid for Robinson at the end of the season. Though Rodgers left Watford and was succeeded by Malky Mackay, Robinson had <b>already</b> <b>decide</b> to leave the club.|$|R
5000|$|Tetkowski became seriously {{involved}} with {{art and music}} in the tenth grade. At the age of seventeen, he had <b>already</b> <b>decide</b> to be a potter and planned {{to live in a}} rural setting. But additional travel in the United States, Mexico and Europe broadened his teenage goals. He then graduated from Grand Island High School in 1973. Subsequent study at Alfred University challenged his notions of craft and fine art. Tetkowski said {{he has no intention of}} being [...] " [...] a culturally displaced potter, making medieval ware for a twentieth century audience".|$|R

5|$|Under hypnosis, Scully {{recalls the}} Rebels burning her fellow abductees, {{as well as}} a Colonist {{spacecraft}} killing the Rebels and abducting Cassandra. During a meeting with Walter Skinner, Mulder continues to insist that the events have been orchestrated by the military and not by aliens. Meanwhile, the Russian vaccine seems to have no effect on Marita. The First Elder tells the Well-Manicured Man that they have <b>already</b> <b>decided</b> to turn the Rebel over to the Colonists. Jeffrey shows Scully a video of him talking about aliens while under hypnosis while he was a child, claiming his mother had forced him to make those statements.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Bradford City, {{he joined}} Sheffield United, {{where he also}} took up a {{coaching}} role. When he retired in 2004, he remained at Sheffield United as assistant to Neil Warnock. Working alongside Warnock and learning the managerial ropes from him, he helped mastermind The Blades' promotion to the Premier League in 2006. United were relegated to the Championship {{on the final day}} of the 2006–07 season and Warnock resigned three days later. McCall had <b>already</b> <b>decided</b> that the 2006–07 season would be his last as assistant manager, and when he was overlooked as a successor to the United manager's position, in favour of Bryan Robson, he decided to leave after five years with the club.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{writes a}} love song for Marge, who seems {{completely}} oblivious to him until he tells her {{that he is in}} love with her. She explains to him that she loves Homer, and that he should tell his wife how he feels about her. He agrees, and decides to take Marge back to Homer and then get rid of Verity. When the two arrive in Springfield, Homer and the children are ecstatic to see Marge. However, Verity has <b>already</b> <b>decided</b> to leave Charles, and has found a new partner: Marge's sister Patty. They were brought together by their hatred for Homer and begin to insult him. When an offended Homer threatens to vote in favor of a law that prohibits same-sex couples from adopting children, Patty forces Homer into confessing that he is too lazy to actually do it. At the end of the episode, Homer plays a guitar and expresses his undying love for his newly bought plasma television and (to a lesser extent) Marge.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{had hoped}} {{to pursue a career}} in the British Army, but his mother vetoed an active {{military}} career. He had been gazetted colonel on 9 November 1858—to his disappointment, as he had wanted to earn his commission by examination. In September 1861, Edward was sent to Germany, supposedly to watch military manoeuvres, but actually in order to engineer a meeting between him and Princess Alexandra of Denmark, the eldest daughter of Prince Christian of Denmark and his wife Louise. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert had <b>already</b> <b>decided</b> that Edward and Alexandra should marry. They met at Speyer on 24 September under the auspices of his elder sister, Victoria, who had married the Crown Prince of Prussia in 1858. Edward's elder sister, acting upon instructions from their mother, had met Princess Alexandra at Strelitz in June; the young Danish princess made a very favourable impression. Edward and Alexandra were friendly from the start; the meeting went well for both sides, and marriage plans advanced.|$|E
5|$|Flowing from Auerbach's {{emphasis}} on teamwork, what was also striking about his teams {{was that they}} never {{seemed to have a}} dominant scorer: in the 1960–61 NBA season, for instance, the Celtics had six players who scored between 15 and 21 points per game, but none made the Top 10 scoring list. In 1964, he sent out the first-ever NBA starting five consisting of an African-American quintet, namely Russell, Willie Naulls, Tom Sanders, Sam Jones, and K. C. Jones. Auerbach would go a step further in the 1966–67 NBA season, when he stepped down after winning nine titles in 11 years, and made Bill Russell player-coach. Auerbach also popularized smoking a victory cigar whenever he thought a game was <b>already</b> <b>decided,</b> a habit that became cult-like in popularity in the Boston area. Furthermore, having acquired a reputation as a fierce competitor, he often got into verbal altercations with officials, receiving more fines and getting ejected more often than any other coach in NBA history.|$|E
5|$|Herring was {{promoted}} to the temporary rank of major general on 14August1941 {{when he took over}} command of the 6th Division. He returned to Australia with it in March 1942. Unaware that the government had <b>already</b> <b>decided</b> that General Sir Thomas Blamey should be appointed Commander in Chief, Herring, along with Major General George Alan Vasey and Brigadier Clive Steele, approached Army Minister Frank Forde with a proposal that all officers over the age of 50 be immediately retired and Major General Horace Robertson appointed Commander in Chief. The 'revolt of the generals' collapsed with the announcement that General Blamey was returning from the Middle East to become Commander in Chief, but seems to have done the participants no harm.|$|E

5|$|Joscelin {{tried to}} take back Edessa {{following}} Zengi's murder, but Nur ad-Din defeated him in November 1146. On 16 February 1147, the French crusaders met at Étampes to discuss their route. The Germans had <b>already</b> <b>decided</b> to travel overland through Hungary, as the sea route was politically impractical because Roger II of Sicily was an enemy of Conrad. Many of the French nobles distrusted the land route, which would take them through the Byzantine Empire, the reputation of which still suffered from the accounts of the First Crusaders. Nevertheless, {{it was decided to}} follow Conrad, and to set out on 15 June. Roger II was offended and refused to participate any longer. In France, Abbot Suger and Count William II of Nevers were elected as regents while the king would be on crusade. In Germany, further preaching was done by Adam of Ebrach, and Otto of Freising also took the cross. The Germans planned to set out at Easter, but did not leave until May.|$|E
5|$|Jun Maeda, {{the main}} {{scenario}} writer of Air, commented {{that in the}} early stages of Air production, it was <b>already</b> <b>decided</b> that it was to be an adult game, and he further assumes that if it was not at least first released with adult content, that it would not have been as commercially successful. Maeda also commented that he wanted to write Air to give players the chance to experience the entire story as a whole rather than just a sum of differing parts as typical bishōjo games do, including Kanon. While attempting to do this, Maeda also tried to simultaneously make it seem similar to typical visual novels in the same genre as Air to give the game appeal to the players who often play such games. As such, while the game incorporates stories from several characters, they are all of varying lengths.|$|E
5|$|One colonist at Wessagusset, {{seeing these}} signs and other {{indications}} of hostility, fled to Plymouth to bring word of an imminent attack. Adding to his desperation {{and the perception}} of imminent hostility, he was pursued by natives during his flight. Arriving at Plymouth on March 24, he met with the Governor and town council. It is unclear whether this colonist's report was the tipping point, or whether Plymouth had <b>already</b> <b>decided</b> to mount a preemptive attack. Plymouth's Edward Winslow had recently been warned by Massasoit, a sachem whose life he saved using English medicine, of a conspiracy of several tribes against Wessagusset and Plymouth. The threatening tribes, he was told, were led by the Massachusett but also included the Nauset, Paomet, Succonet, Mattachiest, Agowaywam, and Capawack tribes {{from as far away as}} Martha's Vineyard. In either case, Plymouth colony sent a small force under Miles Standish to Wessagusset. They arrived there on March 26.|$|E

5|$|The EEF had <b>already</b> <b>decided</b> {{to invade}} Ottoman {{territory}} {{before the first}} battle of Gaza, {{on the basis of}} Britain's three major war objectives: to maintain maritime supremacy in the Mediterranean, preserve {{the balance of power in}} Europe, and protect Egypt, India and the Persian Gulf. Despite the EEF's defeats during the first two battles of Gaza (with about 10,000 casualties), Allenby planned an advance into Palestine and the capture of Jerusalem to secure the region and cut off the Ottoman forces in Mesopotamia from those in the Levant and on the Arabian Peninsula. The capture of Gaza, which dominated the coastal route from Egypt to Jaffa, was a first step towards these aims.|$|E
5|$|Thuyet had <b>already</b> <b>decided</b> {{to place}} Hàm Nghi {{at the head}} of the Phong Trào Cần Vuơng (Loyalty to the Emperor Movement), which sought to end French rule with a royalist rebellion. Phan helped the cause by setting up bases in Hà Tĩnh and {{creating}} his own guerrilla army. Thuyet had hoped to secure support from the Qing Dynasty of China, but Phan thought that Vietnam's best chance of effective support came from Siam. Gia Long, the founder of the Nguyễn Dynasty and great-grandfather of Tự Đức, had married his sister off to the King of Siam. He had also used Siam as a base-in-exile during his quest for the throne in the 1780s. However, direct appeals to the Siamese government only yielded a few pack trains of firearms and ammunition. In preparation for the revolt, Thuyet had been building up an armed base at Tan So for over a year.|$|E
5|$|Written by Donald Tosh. Beginning life as The Rosacrutians, {{this story}} came about after Tosh {{contacted}} the production staff in early 1968 {{to see if}} they would be interested in him pitching a script. Initial discussion saw the story begin as a story featuring Jamie and Victoria, but by the time Tosh delivered the first materials for the story Patrick Troughton had <b>already</b> <b>decided</b> to depart the series. At the point it was turned down by the production team Tosh had completed a script for the first episode and notes for the subsequent three episodes. Tosh completed a full storyline for DWM in 1994. Set on an Earth Space station it deals with a conflict between the staff of the station and the Rosemariners, a group who plan to hold the staff hostage in return for Earth supplying them with sophisticated weapons. It was later adapted by Tosh for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in September 2012.|$|E
