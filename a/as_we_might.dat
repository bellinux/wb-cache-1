25|$|The Department of Energy ordered {{suspension}} of FutureGen 2.0 in February, 2015. The funds, appropriated by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, {{needed to be}} committed by July 1 and spent by Sept 30, 2015. The government also cited the Alliance's inability to raise the requisite amount of private funding. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz explained {{at a press conference}} “If you look between now and July 1, without them having closed their financing, and try <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>might,</b> we just don’t see how it gets over the finish line.” At the time of suspension the power plant part of the project had spent $116.5 million and the sequestration part had spent $86 million.|$|E

500|$|The ending, {{in which}} the pirates are each {{shot to death by}} American snipers, {{reflects}} the resolution of the pirate hijacking of the MV Maersk Alabama in April 2009, where U.S. Navy SEALs rescued the captain after three snipers simultaneously killed three pirates with one shot each. They are portrayed in a particularly sympathetic light when they are killed during the ending. Travis Fickett of IGN said, [...] "It's one of those moments where South Park feels the need to give voice to a side the media is ignoring—and points out that things aren't quite as cut and dry [...] <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> like." [...] The episode has also been described as a commentary on the way in which Americans tend to take their relative wealth and comfort for granted. A U.S. Navy SEAL ordering another to [...] "not hit the white ones" [...] has also been described as an indictment of the American approach to foreign policy.|$|E
2500|$|Whenever Morihei Ueshiba took a class Ruddock [...] "tried to {{pay close}} {{attention}} to what he did, but it must be remembered, not one of any sensei's class was a lesson <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> think of it. The sensei did a 'technique' and then everyone got up and tried to replicate what had been done. If they came to 'help' you it was merely a straightforward re-enactment of what they had done initially. The only one who 'taught' in our western understanding was Koichi Tohei who had been to Hawaii and parts of the United States. Koichi Tohei was the only sensei who gave lessons or spoke to foreigners in English. His style was very free.... Now he is known for Ki Aikido. I attended all of the lessons he gave in a small dojo in Iidabashi." ...|$|E

2500|$|John Molyneux {{explains}} {{in his article}} Emin Matters, that her work revolves around class, sex and art itself. He writes that, [...] "What she does do is present herself as culturally working class…She makes no attempt to engage in 'intellectual art speak' but sticks to unaffected everyday language," [...] employing a strategy that doesn't place her in authority over her viewers or peers. However, her class background contradicts this tactic of equal understanding. Emin's mother until age seven owned a hotel in Margate, but bankruptcy and poverty ensued only when she broke up with Emin's father. While she may use street language, swear words, grammatical errors and misspellings to convey a primarily middle-class female experience, Emin now functions as a boss of her own art business and exists within the elite upper class. Her relationship with sex is a major theme and aspect of her work. Feminist writers have reviewed Emin's pieces as containing, [...] "…no element of eroticism or titillation…unlike in Botticelli, Renoir or Klimt. Nor is it sexual fantasy or dreams, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> find in surrealism, or {{the sex of the}} brothel featured so heavily in late 19th-century French art. It is real, everyday sex—as experienced by her, of course, but also by millions of other people".|$|E
2500|$|No Isis album {{contains}} an explicit , or story arc, instead focusing on themes rather than stories. As such, releases {{are defined by}} some as [...] "pseudo-concept albums". The band see lyrics as important, {{but at the same}} time, Turner does not feel it necessary to enunciate every word. Instead, any connections made are mainly conjecture, and the formation of a theme takes into account the album artwork, previous albums, track titles and the use of metaphor just as much as lyricism. Oceanic tells a convoluted tale involving love, incest and suicide by drowning. This relates to the theme of the all-powerful female, present lyrically in every album except Panopticon. Turner does not explicitly acknowledge an [...] "overtly feminine theme"; however, he does state: [...] "I just think it's interesting to include that as part of what we do, simply because metal, especially, is considered to be this very male-oriented, testosterone-driven art form, and I feel like it's important to recognize the other side of our nature. As manly <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> or might not be, we have to acknowledge that there is a feminine part of our persona, and that the world isn't made up of absolutes. To achieve balance, you have to recognize every facet of yourself and everyone else around you." [...] Certain threads do reappear between albums, notes Turner. [...] "There are certain themes which reoccur in my work just because of what I'm interested in and what is aesthetically pleasing for me", he says. [...] "The idea of futuristic utopias and dystopias is probably something that does consciously and subconsciously return time and time again [...] and sometimes I just can't help the fact that these themes creep into my work whether it's conscious or not". The other two ongoing motifs in the lyrics and artwork are that of towers and mosquitos.|$|E
