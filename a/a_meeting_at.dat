A Hungarian army invading Carinthia was defeated in April and Aventinus describes a defeat of the Hungarians by Margrave Luitpold at the river Fischa in the same year.|$|E

5|$|The {{club was}} formed {{following}} <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>at</b> the Eastville Restaurant in Bristol in September 1883. It was initially called Black Arabs F.C., after the Arabs rugby {{team and the}} predominantly black kits in which they played. This name only lasted for the 1883–84 season, and {{in a bid to}} draw more fans from the local area the club was renamed Eastville Rovers in 1884.|$|E
5|$|By 1938, rumours purported that Stanley Matthews {{wanted to}} leave Stoke to further his career. This led to <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>at</b> Kings Hall, {{attended}} by three thousand people with a further thousand outside. Matthews opted to stay with Stoke and helped the club to finish in seventh place in the 1938–39 season. The outbreak of the Second World War prevented further progress as the league was suspended for six years. After resumption of the FA Cup, 33 fans died and 520 were injured during a sixth round away game against Bolton Wanderers when the crush barriers gave way on the terraces.|$|E
5|$|By 1980, the {{authorities}} {{had no choice}} but to make another attempt to raise consumer prices to realistic levels, but they knew that doing so would likely spark another worker rebellion. Western bankers providing loans to the Polish government at <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>at</b> the Bank Handlowy in Warsaw on 1 July 1980 made it clear that low prices of consumer goods could no longer be subsidized by the state. The government gave in and on 1 July announced a system of gradual but continuous price rises, particularly for meat. A wave of strikes and factory occupations began at once, with the biggest ones taking place in Lublin in July 1980.|$|E

5|$|During the {{preparation}} of the new constitution for West Germany, discussions regarding its national symbols took place in August 1948 during <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>at</b> Herrenchiemsee. Although there were objections {{to the creation of a}} national flag before reunification with the east, it was decided to proceed. This decision was primarily motivated by the proposed constitution by the eastern SED in November 1946, where black-red-gold were suggested as the colours for a future German republic.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, local {{businessman}} Leonard P. Thompson {{threatened to}} lead a breakaway from the amateur club to create an entirely separate professional club, Ipswich United. John Murray Cobbold, the club President, called together rival factions for <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>at</b> the Town Hall on 1 May 1936, at which {{it was agreed that}} Ipswich Town should turn professional. The club was unanimously elected to the Southern League for the 1936–37 season and former Irish international footballer Mick O'Brien was appointed as the club's first professional manager.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, Griffin {{was invited}} to address <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>at</b> the University of Bath by {{politics}} student and BNP youth leader Danny Lake. Lake wanted Griffin to visit the university and explain the BNP's policies to lecturers and students. The invitation was viewed by some as {{an attempt by the}} party to establish a foothold on the university campus. Eleven union general secretaries wrote to the university's vice-chancellor and asked her to reconsider the decision to allow the meeting. A large protest was planned, and following students' concerns over their personal safety, the University cancelled the invitation.|$|E

5|$|In an editorial, the Lyttelton Times welcomed Sewell's {{intention}} of representing the electorate again, but criticised {{him for the}} briefness of his statement. The newspaper's expectation was that Sewell should publicly state what his policies were, and not just rely on his past representation in Parliament. On 7 January 1860, Sewell placed an advertisement in the Lyttelton Times, inviting electors to <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>at</b> the Mechanics' Institute next to the Christchurch Town Hall on Friday, 13 January.|$|E

After <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>at</b> Scapa Flow later in July between Sims, Jellicoe, and Admiral David Beatty (commander of the Grand Fleet), the Admiralty {{requested that the}} U.S. Navy send four dreadnoughts and six destroyers to join the Grand Fleet. The Admiralty intended that {{the arrival of the}} American dreadnoughts would allow it to decommission five ships of the pre-dreadnought , freeing up four thousand officers and ratings to serve on new light cruisers, destroyers, and submarines then under construction.|$|E
5|$|Massino, Napolitano and Gerlando Sciascia, a Sicilian-born capo {{linked to}} the Montreal Rizzuto crime family, {{arranged}} <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>at</b> a Brooklyn social club with the three capos for May 5, 1981. They had four gunmen, including Vitale and Bonanno-affiliated Montreal boss Vito Rizzuto, hiding in a closet to ambush them. When Trinchera, Giaccone and Indelicato arrived with Frank Lino to meet Massino they were shot to death, with Massino himself stopping Indelicato from escaping. Lino escaped unscathed by running out the door. The hit further improved Massino's prestige, but was marred by both Lino's escape and the discovery of Indelicato's body on May 20.|$|E

As a result, Football Club Barcelona was born. The blue and red colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900; the prevailing Catalonia conception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, Crystal Palace.|$|E

5|$|On 5 September 1882 Shaw {{attended}} <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>at</b> the Memorial Hall, Farringdon, {{addressed by}} the political economist Henry George. Shaw then read George's book Progress and Poverty, which awakened his interest in economics. He began attending meetings of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), where he discovered the writings of Karl Marx, and thereafter spent much of 1883 reading Das Kapital. He was not impressed by the SDF's founder, H. M. Hyndman, whom he found autocratic, ill-tempered and lacking leadership qualities. Shaw doubted {{the ability of the}} SDF to harness the working classes into an effective radical movement and did not join it—he preferred, he said, to work with his intellectual equals.|$|E

The sheriff rejected the allegations as unfounded and voiced his displeasure over the vote, calling them politically motivated due to their proximity to the primary elections, which was only weeks away at the time.|$|E
