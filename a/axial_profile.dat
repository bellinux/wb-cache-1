40|$|A simple {{model is}} {{proposed}} to evaluate (a) the divergence of velocity vector conditioned on unburned mixture, and (b) the vector component normal to the mean flame brush in the flamelet regime of premixed turbulent combustion. The model involves a single constant {{and does not}} invoke an extra balance equation. To perform the first test of the model, six flames stabilized in impinging jets and experimentally investigated by 4 research groups were numerically simulated. In the computations, (a) approximations of the measured <b>axial</b> <b>profiles</b> of the mean combustion progress variable were invoked, (b) the well-known (Bray et al., 1998, and 2000) statistically steady and 1 -dimensional Favre-averaged continuity and Euler equations were numerically integrated in order to approximate the measured <b>axial</b> <b>profiles</b> of the mean axial velocity, and, then, (c) the approximations were utilized in order to evaluate conditioned velocities and turbulent scalar flux using the proposed model supplemented with the BML approach and balance equation for the Favre-averaged combustion progress variable. The obtained agreement between the measured and computed <b>axial</b> <b>profiles</b> of the conditioned axial velocities or axial turbulent scalar flux was encouraging, thus, indicating that the proposed simple model is promising. Since the correlation between fluctuations of velocity and unity normal vectors, conditioned to flamelet surface, {{plays a key role}} in the model, the encouraging test results call for studying this correlation in future DNS.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the structure of}} two-dimensional, axisymmetric, laminar hydrogen-air flames in which a cylindrical fuel stream is surrounded by coflowing air, using laser-diagnostic and computational methods. Spontaneous Raman scattering and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) are {{used to measure the}} distributions of major species and temperature. Computationally, we solve the governing conservation equations for mass, momentum, energy, and species, using detailed chemistry and transport. The fuel is diluted with nitrogen (1 : 1) to reduce heat transfer to the burner, to match the zero temperature gradient at the fuel exit. Three average fuel exit velocities are studied: 18, 27, and 50 cm/s. Comparisons of the measured and computed results are performed for radial profiles at a number of axial positions, and along the axial centerline. Peak major species mole fractions and temperatures are quantitatively predicted by the computations, and the <b>axial</b> species <b>profiles</b> are predicted to within the experimental uncertainty. In the radial profiles studied, base-case computations excluding thermal diffusion of light species were in excellent agreement with the measurements. While the addition of thermal diffusion led to some discrepancy with the measured results, the magnitude of the differences was no more than 25 %. The computations predicted the <b>axial</b> centerline <b>profiles</b> from the burner exit to the maximum temperature well, though the experimental temperatures in the downstream mixing region decreased somewhat faster than the computed profiles. Radiative losses are seen to be negligible in these flames, and changes in transport properties and variations in initial flow velocities generally led to only modest changes in the <b>axial</b> <b>profiles.</b> The results also show that the detailed <b>axial</b> <b>profiles</b> of major species and temperature at different fuel jet velocities scale quantitatively with the jet velocity.

The paper reviews available data on the axial variation in burnup {{and the effect of}} <b>axial</b> burnup <b>profiles</b> on reactivity in a SNF cask. A publicly available database of profiles is examined to identify profiles that maximize the neutron multiplication factor, k{sub eff}, assess its adequacy for general PWR burnup credit analyses, and investigate the existence of trends with fuel type and/or reactor operations.

Due to low pollutant emission and superior combustion characteristics hydrogen/hydrocarbon blends have received increased attention as alternative fuels for numerous power generation applications.
