40|$|Horizontal divergence, {{relative}} vorticity, kinematic vertical velocity, and geostrophic and <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>winds</b> are {{computed from}} Colorado profiler network data to investigate an upslope snowstorm in northeastern Colorado. Horizontal divergence and relative vorticity are computed using the Gauss and Stokes theorems, respectively. Kinematic vertical velocities are {{obtained from the}} surface to 9 km by vertically integrating the continuity equation. The geostrophic and <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>winds</b> are computed by applying a finite differencing technique to evaluate the derivatives in the horizontal equations of motion. Comparison of the synoptic-scale data with the profiler network data reveals that the two datasets are generally consistent. Also, the profiler-derived quantities exhibit coherent vertical and temporal patterns consistent with conceptual and theoretical flow fields of various meteorological phenomena. It is suggested that the profiler-derived quantities are of potential use to weather forecasters in that they enable the dynamic and kinematic interpretation of weather system structure to be made and thus have nowcasting and short-term forecasting value...|$|R
50|$|The {{horizontal}} shear and horizontal deformation direct to concentrate the pole-equator temperature gradient {{over a large}} synoptic scale (1000 km). The quasi-geostrophic equations fail in the dynamics of frontogenesis because this weather phenomenon is of smaller scale compared to the Rossby radius; so semigeostrophic theory is used. Generally, Rossby number—ratio of inertial to coriolis terms—is used to formulate a condition of geostrophic flow. Across the front, the Rossby number is {{on the order of}} udu/dx/fv = (10 m/s)^2/(1000 km)/(1e-4 s-1)/(1 m/s) = 1; this shows we cannot ignore the inertial term (one must take into account the <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>wind).</b> Along the front, the Rossby number is on the order of udv/dx/fu = (10 m/s)/(1000 km)*(1e-4 s-1)*(10 m/s) = 0.01, which means it is in geostrophic and thermal wind balance. Finally, looking at a cross section (y-z) through the confluent flow, using Q-vectors (Q pointing toward upward motion), on the warm side (bottom of confluent schematic), there is upward motion and on the other hand, the cold side (top of confluent schematic), there is downward motion.The cross-section points out convergence (arrows pointing towards each other) associated with tightening of horizontal temperature gradient. Conversely, divergence is noticed (arrows point away from each other), associated with stretching horizontal temperature gradient. Since the strength of the ageostrophic flow is proportional to temperature gradient, the ageostrophic tightening tendencies grow rapidly after the initial geostrophic intensification.|$|E

40|$|Atmospheric {{effects of}} sea surface {{temperature}} (SST) fronts along the Kuroshio and Kuroshio Extension (K-KE) are investigated by examining spatial {{characteristics of the}} climatological sea level pressure (SLP), surface winds and surface heat flux (Q) fields based on an in situ observation dataset. A hydrostatic effect of the SST front is observed during the northwesterly monsoon characterized by a westward-extending low-SLP wedge (trough) slightly south of the peak in Q along the K-KE. Ageostrophic surface westerlies crossing SLP isobars toward a trough center are found north of the low-SLP wedge apparently because of the eastward acceleration by the vertical mixing effect. This feature of the <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>winds</b> is less pronounced south of it, a north-south asymmetry arising as vertical mixing accelerates (decelerates) eastward <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>winds</b> north (south) of it. While the SLP trough near the SST front is found nearly year-round except for summer, its meridional location seasonally migrates {{probably due to the}} change in the mean surface flow. Regional atmospheric model experiments are conducted to examine the effect of the SST front on the overlying atmosphere. The observed features in winter are adequately simulated when high-resolution SST is prescribed as the boundary condition. The strong Q along the K-KE and resultant SLP trough and <b>ageostrophic</b> surface <b>winds</b> are absent when the SST boundary condition is smoothed in space to weaken the SST front. These results illustrate that the cross-frontal change in Q is of great importance to leave the SST imprint on the overlying atmosphere via hydrostatic and vertical mixing adjustments...|$|R

40|$|Theoretical and {{modeling}} studies of nongeostrophic effects in baroclinic waves predict that baroclinic waves should tilt poleward with height, {{with a larger}} tilt in total meridional wind than in geostrophic quantities. Regression analysis of NCEP–NCAR reanalysis 6 -hourly data demonstrates that observed baroclinic waves do indeed tilt poleward with height, although the observed tilt is smaller than predicted by previous studies. The meridional <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> enhances the poleward tilt of meridional wind perturbations, despite being smaller in amplitude than the meridional geostrophic wind {{by a factor of}} 5. An improved estimate {{of the structure of the}} meridional <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> in baroclinic waves is calculated assuming force balance. Several important terms in this estimate have been left out of previous estimates of the meridional <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>wind.</b> Three terms in the improved estimate produce nearly all of the poleward tilt of the meridional wind: 1) the advection of geostrophic zonal wind perturbations by the mean zonal wind, 2) the convergence of the eddy momentum flux, and 3) the effect of friction. The poleward tilt with height of baroclinic waves explains why upper-level storm tracks tend to occur poleward of near-surface baroclinic regions, and may play a role in the midwinter suppression of the Pacific storm track. 1...|$|E
40|$|Strong gyres and jets can be {{generated}} at auroral latitudes in the thermosphere by enhanced electric fields during geomagnetic substorms. Typical height profiles of ion density suggest that the ion drag force should generate large curvature in the vertical profile of the winds in the highly viscous region of the thermosphere above about 200 km. It is proposed that the poststorm spin-down of these gyres and jets proceeds via Ekman circulations driven by the curvatures in the height profiles of the winds. Analytic and numerical calculations of the ageostrophic winds forced by curvature in model geostrophic wind profiles show that the <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> speeds and directions depend mainly on the kinematic viscosity {{in the region of}} curvature and the total change in shear in the geostrophic wind. <b>Ageostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> speeds for typical thermospheric jets can exceed 200 m/s (about 50 percent of the jet winds).

Elimination of tropical data produced excessively strong upper tropospheric westerlies which in turn amplified the globally integrated rotational flow kinetic energy by around 10 percent and doubled the global divergent flow kinetic energy.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of the structure of a warm frontal region as deduced from Doppler radar observations. The precipitation occurring ahead of the surface warm front was banded. The dominant precipitation bands were oriented transverse to the mid-level winds, and they were spaced 110 km apart. It is suggested that these bands were formed by highly organized vertical circulations in a 2. 5 km thick layer just above the warm frontal zone. The precipitation bands extended from this layer down to the surface. Near the surface additional circulations were produced by pressure perturbations resulting from cooling associated with melting snow. Some diagnostic calculations of <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>winds,</b> frontogenesis and vorticity production are presented.

40|$|The {{role of the}} ageostrophic {{vorticity}} {{tendencies in}} the Zwack–Okossi vorticity tendency equation has been examined within the context that this term in the equation acts as a correction term for the vorticity tendency or height tendency calculations. In this paper, this term is shown to act as both a response to initial forcing and as a forcing mechanism itself in modulating the initial forcing. Using an earlier methodology for partitioning the wind field and the height field into their divergent and rotational parts, the <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> is shown to contain components of both parts. Then, using an omega equation, an ageostrophic vorticity tendency is cal-culated, which has forcing mechanisms similar to a height tendency equation. This ageostrophic tendency is then used in this height tendency equation and provides for an improved method of calculating the <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> rather than simply calculating it as a residual. Two case studies are then examined to demonstrate this point. For both case studies, the calculated height tendencies using the derived ageostrophic winds and those calculated as a residual overestimated the height tendencies, especially at the surface. While the correlation coefficients show that the two methods are comparable at 500 hPa, at the surface there is a notable degree of improvement in the pattern similarity. This resulted in an improved representation of the 500 -hPa height ten-dencies for {{the onset of the}} Atlantic blocking event despite marginal improvements in the calculated field overall. 1...|$|E

The analysis of results considers both upper-level (324 K) ageostrophic fields and low-level (304 K) fields. Preliminary results tend to support Uccellini and Johnson's (1979) hypothesis concerning upper-level-jet/low-level-jet (ULJ/LLJ) coupling in the exit region of the ULJ.

40|$|Quantitative {{predictions}} of surface extratropical cyclone development are correlated {{to the degree}} of upper-level forcing from 500 mb vorticity advection and 300 mb divergence. Although it is difficult to obtain an accurate analysis of upper-level divergence, modern models and data assimilation procedures do produce consistent divergence fields. The divergence field partitioned into the longitudinal (alongstream) and transverse (cross-stream) components approximately estimates the effect of curvature and jet streaks on cyclone intensification. Verification of the Eta model indicated not significant difference in the mean central pressure to a confidence level of 95 %, and verification of the 300 mb divergence was very similar to the 500 mb vorticity advection. The presence of subgeostrophic flow in the trough and supergeostrophic flow in the ridge was noted with the longitudinal divergence. Large variability in longitudinal divergence reflected some sensitivity to small-scale perturbations in the height field. Transverse divergence showed greater consistency and projected a similar wind pattern to the classic jet streak model, however, modifications were seen as <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>winds</b> may also be directed toward regions of height falls. The composition of the total divergence from the longitudinal and transverse divergence is about 50 : 50. However, with very large total divergence values, the dominant contributor is the transverse divergence. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R

40|$|A model-based {{approach}} to estimating near-surface wind fields {{over the ocean}} from Seasat scatterometer (SASS) measurements is presented. The approach is a direct assimilation technique in which wind field model parameters are estimated directly from the scatterometer measurements of the radar backscatter of the ocean's surface using maximum likelihood principles. The wind field estimate is then computed from the estimated model parameters. The wind field model used in this approach is based on geostrophic approximation and on simplistic assumptions about the wind field vorticity and divergence but includes <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>winds.</b> Nine days of SASS data were processed to obtain unique wind estimates. Comparisons in performance to the traditional two-step (point-wise wind retrieval followed by ambiguity removal) wind estimate method and the model-based method are provided using both simulated radar backscatter measurements and actual SASS measurements. In the latter case the results are compared to wind fields determined using subjective ambiguity removal. While the traditional approach results in missing measurements and reduced effective swath width due to fore/aft beam cell coregistration problems, the model-based approach uses all available measurements to increase the effective swath width and to reduce data gaps. The results reveal that the model-based wind estimates have accuracy comparable to traditionally estimated winds with less 'noise' in the directional estimates, particularly at low wind speeds...|$|R

40|$|The {{storm of}} the 28 of October 2013 {{was one of}} the strongest of the last 10 years, with wind gusts up to 152 km/h above the Wadden islands. In Meteorologica, a {{discussion}} started about the cause of the high winds experienced during this storm. With the help of Mode-S EHS aircraft data it is investigated to what extent the isallobaric wind has a large contribution to the total wind field. Mode-S EHS data, which is accumulated from an enhanced surveillance air traffic control radar that follows all the aircrafts in its range, contains information about the wind and the temperature. The quality of Mode-S EHS data is checked by a comparison with the Cabauw tower and the wind profiler at Cabauw. From this comparison, it is found that the quality of the Mode-S EHS data is good to use for further research. For the case study of the storm of the 28 of October 2013, the theoretical wind is determined with the finite difference method and with the piecewise linear interpolation method with the geopotential height from Harmonie 38 h 1. 2. With these two methods the geostrophic wind, the isallobaric wind and the inertial-advective component of the <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> are determined. From this, it follows that the isallobaric wind and the inertial-advective component of the <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> counteract each other {{near the center of the}} extratropical cyclone.

40|$|A {{perturbation}} {{potential vorticity}} (PV) theory is developed {{to investigate the}} three-dimensional, time-depen-dent, linear geostrophic adjustment of a stably stratified, Boussinesq atmosphere that is disturbed from (i) quiescent equilibrium due to a localized, unbalanced, zonal wind anomaly and (ii) geostrophic equilibrium of the uniform zonal flow due to an isolated couplet of acceleration–deceleration forcing. This prescribed zonal momentum forcing propagates downstream at a speed c that {{is less than the}} basic-state zonal flow speed U and physically represents the parameterized effects of nonlinear inertial advection. Transient, dispersive inertia–gravity waves in all fields are essentially removed during the early stage of the response associated with the initial value problem. The steady-state equilibrium that conserves the initial per-turbation PV is a localized, geostrophic zonal jet with meridionally confluent (diffluent) flow in its entrance (exit) region. This jet is supported by a couplet of perturbation low and high pressure north and south of the zonal jet core, respectively. There exist no steady-state <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>winds</b> and vertical motions once balanced equilibrium is reached.

It also detected an area of locally heavy rain over southeastern Pennsylvania on 4 -S December 1993. In both cases, distinct bands of enhanced precipitation were embedded within broader areas of precipitation. The bands were oriented along the 1000 - to SOO-mb thermal wind vector and were nearly parallel to the 8 S 0 -mb isotherms. For both cases, the WSR- 88 D velocity azimuth display (VAD) wind profile (VWP) indicated a low-level northeasterly flow, which veered with height and became southwesterly aloft. Base velocity data from the O. S degree elevation scan revealed the clas-sic warm advection "S"~shaped _ pattern over central Pennsylvania.

40|$|Abstract: Numerical {{simulations}} {{are presented}} {{to examine the}} sensitivity of the temperature field in the northern Alpine foreland on the large-scale wind direction. The simulations are set up such that changing the wind direction does not create any large-scale systematic temperature advection, thereby isolating the effects of the flow interaction with the Alps. The results show indeed an appreciable impact. In the afternoon, temperatures tend to be higher for southerly flow directions than for northerly ones, as might be expected from the fact that subsidence in the lee of the Alps causes warming while upslope flow is related to cooling. In the morning, however, the lowest temperatures are found for easterly directions while northwesterly flow shows the highest temperatures, followed by westerly flow. The primary reasons for this behaviour are the asymmetry of the flow around the Alpine massif as a whole and the interaction of the friction-induced <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> component with the Alps...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{mechanisms}} for supporting summer nocturnal precipitation across the central United States is the Great Plains low-level Jet (LLJ). Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs) are organized storm complexes that can be supported from the upward vertical motion supplied at the terminus of the LLJ, which bring beneficial rains to farmers. As such, a need for forecasting these storm complexes exists. Correlating forecast skills of the LLJ and MCS precipitation in high spatial resolution modeling was the main goal of this research. STAGE IV data was used as observations for MCS precipitation and the 00 -hr 13 km RUC analysis was employed for evaluation of the LLJ. The 4 km WRF was used for high resolution forecast simulations, with 2 microphysics and 3 planetary boundary layer schemes selected for a sensitivity study to see which model run best simulated reality. It {{was found that the}} forecast skill of the potential temperature and directional components of the geostrophic and <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>winds</b> within the LLJ correlated well with MCS precipitation, especially early during LLJ evolution. Since the 20 real cases sampled consisted of three LLJ types (synoptic, inertial oscillation and transition), forecast skill in other parameters such as deep layer and low level shear, convergence, frontogenesis and stability parameters were compared to MCS forecast skill to see if consistent signals outside of the LLJ influenced MCS evolution in forecasts. No correlations were found among these additional parameters. Given the variety of synoptic setups present, the lack of forecast skill correlations between several variables and MCSs resulted as different synoptic or mesoscale mechanisms played varying roles if importance in different cases...|$|R

The analysis {{is supported by a}} numerical experiment based on the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model performed at high horizontal resolution of 2 km and spanning the complete observational period (10 years). Results indicate that WRF is able to reproduce the inter-annual wind variability but with a tendency to be too geostrophic. At seasonal scales, we find a differentiated behavior between Winter and Summer seasons with the Spring and Autumn transition periods more similar to the Summer and Winter modes, respectively. The winter momentum budget shows a weak intradiurnal variability. The synoptic scale controls the shape of the near surface wind profile that is characterized by weaker and more <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>winds</b> near the surface than at higher altitudes within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) {{as a result of the}} frictional turning. In turn, during summer, mesoscale circulations associated with the differential heating of land and sea become important. As a result, the PBL winds show a stronger intradiurnal component that is characterized by an oscillation of the near surface winds around the geostrophic direction with the maximum departure in the afternoon. Although also driven by thermal land-sea differences, this mesoscale component is not associated with the classical concept of a sea-breeze front. It originates from the thermal expansion of the boundary layer over land and primarily differs from the sea-breeze in its propagation speed resulting in a wind rotation far ahead of any coastal front. We refer to it as the near-coast diurnal acceleration (NCDA). The contribution of the NCDA depends on the specific orientation of the coast (NE-SW at CESAR). Our findings stress the importance of evaluating and understanding the performance of mesoscale models with multi-year observational/simulated data sets in order to provide a statistically robust characterization of the limitations of surface layer and boundary-layer parameterizations and thus compensate for the scarceness of upper level wind observations...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the characteristics of}} gravity waves. Gravity waves occur over the small scale portion of the atmospheric wave spectrum. Gravity waves are associated with oscillations of meteorological parameters such as temperature, wind velocity, pressure, and density and they arise when air becomes stratified due to gravity. Gravity waves can propagate to high altitudes in the atmosphere and exhibit {{a broad spectrum of}} possible periods (minutes until hours) as well as horizontal wavelengths (few hundred kilometres up to approximately thousand kilometres). Gravity waves may therefore transport momentum and energy from their origin (e. g. orography in the troposphere) into other altitudes, e. g. the stratosphere und mesosphere hence influence the general circulation of the atmosphere. The characteristics of non-orographic gravity waves, which arise in mid latitudes, are to a large extent unknown. It prevails so far to ambiguity over it where such non-stationary gravity waves develop and are as large their portion. Observed rising of gravity wave activity near frontal zones and "Jetstreams" over the ocean [Fritts and Nastrom 1992] is a reference on the fact that also different non-orographic sources possess a not insignificant portion of the gravity wave activity. Through systematic evaluation of a four years data record of radiosonde data of a station in the mid latitudes (Lindenberg) a further contribution could be made here for the production of a global climatology for gravity wave activity within the SPARC gravity wave initiative: It was shown that the gravity wave activity in the mid latitudes is clearly smaller (factor 1 / 2) than in tropical areas and possesses a typical annual variation (maximum gravity wave activity in the winter and minimum activity in the summer) which dependent on the background wind, and from which the synoptic situation. The observed gravity waves propagate on the average against the usually dominant west winds. The portion of the upward propagation of the gravity wave energy (Troposphere 50 %, Stratosphere 80 %) points on a source of the gravity waves in the upper troposphere. As sources for gravity waves in the mid latitudes fronts and the "jetstream" during the adjustment of <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>winds</b> to the geostrophic equilibrium ("geostrophic adjustment") come due to the results in question. The observed waves have frequencies near the local inertial frequency, the horizontal wavelengths lie within the range of some hundred kilometres. Several case studies in this thesis showed that the occurrence of increased power densities over Lindenberg with increased wind velocities in the tropopause region collapses and a similar synoptic situation was present, as in the simulation of inertial gravity waves during the development of a baroclinic instability by O'Sullivan and Dunkerton [1995]. Thus the suggestion of gravity waves over Lindenberg appears by the adjustment of a geostrophic imbalance as dominating developing mechanism to prevail...|$|R
