5|$|The scheme, {{consisting}} of a sequence of characters beginning with a letter and followed by any combination of letters, digits, plus (+), period (.), or hyphen (-). Although schemes are case-insensitive, the canonical form is lowercase and documents that specify schemes must do so with lowercase letters. It {{is followed by a}} colon (:). Examples of popular schemes include http(s), ftp, mailto, file, data, and irc. URI schemes should be registered with the Internet <b>Assigned</b> <b>Numbers</b> Authority (IANA), although non-registered schemes are used in practice.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{some other}} states, {{there are no}} formal rules prohibiting the usage of the same route number under {{different}} systems. Motorists using Michigan's highways may encounter I-75 and M-75, as well as both US8 and M-8. Many of the state's US Highways were <b>assigned</b> <b>numbers</b> duplicating those of state trunklines when the US Highway System was created in 1926. The introduction of the Interstate Highway System in the late 1950s further complicated the situation, as each mainline Interstate designation has an unrelated M-n trunkline counterpart elsewhere in the state.|$|E

25|$|The {{numbering}} scheme for the Interstate Highway System {{was developed in}} 1957 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). The association's present numbering policy dates back to August 10, 1973. Within the continental United States, primary Interstates—also called main line Interstates or two-digit Interstates—are <b>assigned</b> <b>numbers</b> less than 100.|$|E
25|$|Using a simpler, {{more memorable}} name {{in place of}} a host's {{numerical}} address dates back to the ARPANET era. The Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) maintained a text file named HOSTS.TXT that mapped host names to the numerical addresses of computers on the ARPANET. Maintenance of numerical addresses, called the <b>Assigned</b> <b>Numbers</b> List, was handled by Jon Postel at the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute (ISI), whose team worked closely with SRI.|$|E
25|$|Ridge Road was {{designated}} MD 29 and Manchester Road was marked as MD 31 when the Maryland State Roads Commission first <b>assigned</b> <b>numbers</b> to state roads in 1927.

25|$|Application layer {{protocols}} generally {{treat the}} transport layer (and lower) protocols as black boxes which provide a stable network connection across which to communicate, although the applications are usually aware of key {{qualities of the}} transport layer connection such as the end point IP addresses and port numbers. Application layer protocols are often associated with particular client-server applications, and common services have well-known port numbers reserved by the Internet <b>Assigned</b> <b>Numbers</b> Authority (IANA). For example, the HyperText Transfer Protocol uses server port 80 and Telnet uses server port 23. Clients connecting to a service usually use ephemeral ports, i.e., port numbers assigned only {{for the duration of}} the transaction at random or from a specific range configured in the application.|$|E
25|$|A {{state highway}} (SH) is funded and {{maintained}} by the state. State highways have been <b>assigned</b> <b>numbers</b> between 1 and 365 with a few exceptions. There is also a State Highway 495 (renumbered from Farm to Market Road 495), as well as canceled routes SH 550 (a temporary designation for what {{is now part of}} I-169) and SH 824 (a temporary designation for what was later part of SH 24). NASA Road 1 and State Highway OSR are also in the State Highway network. The first 26 state highways were designated in 1917. Highways are not organized by directionality of the highway, instead they are generally numbered as they were when first built in the 1920s and 1930s. Most suffixed routes were eliminated by 1939, though SH 75A existed from 1946 to 1994 to match Oklahoma's SH 75A.|$|E
25|$|The {{prisoners are}} <b>assigned</b> <b>numbers</b> for easy {{identification}} {{and in an}} effort to dehumanize them; Ivan Denisovich's prisoner number is Щ-854. Each day, the squad leader receives their work assignment for that day, and the squad are then fed according to how they perform. Prisoners in each squad are thus forced to work together and pressure each other to get their task done. If any prisoner is slacking, the whole squad will be punished. Despite this, Solzhenitsyn shows that a surprising loyalty exists among the work gang members, with Shukhov teaming up with other prisoners to steal felt and extra bowls of porridge; even the squad leader defies the authorities by tar-papering over the empty windows at their work site. Indeed, only through such solidarity can the prisoners do anything more than survive from day to day.|$|E

25|$|The first {{inter-state}} numbering for the Roosevelt Highway was in New England, {{where the}} New England road marking system {{was established in}} 1922. Route 18 followed the auto trail from Portland northwest to Montpelier, where it continued to Burlington via Route 14. Many of the states along the route also <b>assigned</b> <b>numbers</b> to the highway; for instance, New York labeled their portion Route 3 in 1924. The Joint Board on Interstate Highways distributed its preliminary plan in 1925, in which a long section of the highway was labeled US2, from St. Ignace, Michigan west to Bonners Ferry, Idaho. East of St. Ignace, instead of crossing to the Lower Peninsula like the Roosevelt Highway, the proposed Route 2 traveled north to the international border at Sault Ste. Marie. It reappeared at Rouses Point, New York, following Route 30 and then rejoining the auto trail between Burlington and Montpelier. US2 and the Roosevelt Highway both connected Montpelier to St. Johnsbury, but the latter took a direct path along Route 18, while the former was assigned to Route 25 to Wells River, where it overlapped proposed US5 north to St. Johnsbury. There, where the Roosevelt Highway turned southeast to Portland, Route 2 continued east along Route 15 to Bangor and Route 1 to Calais, then heading north on Route 24 to end in Houlton.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} Army transformation, it was re-organized in 1993. The {{division}} of the territory in military regions and zones was kept, with {{the reduction of the}} number of regions, but with the raising of the Airborne Troops Command (using the structure of the previous Air Force's Paratroopers Command) and the Santa Margarida Military Camp as two special territorial commands. The regiments of the Army became again designed by numbers and not anymore by the place where they were based. The <b>assigned</b> <b>numbers</b> were not consecutive, as in previous organizations, but were the historical numbers previously used by each unit or by its predecessor in the same garrison place. The old 1950's plans to equip the Army with light aviation assets were resumed, with the raising of a Light Aviation Unit that was intended to operate helicopters. However, the reception of the planned helicopters was delayed successively until being finally canceled and the unit disbanded. The military regions and zones continued to be responsible for keeping territorial defense brigades and battle groups, mostly maintained only in cadre strength in time of peace. The Army now would have an increased permanent operational force with three brigades: the Independent Airborne Brigade (BAI), the Independent Mechanized Brigade (BMI) and the Light Intervention Brigade (BLI). The BAI resulted from the old Air Force's Light Paratrooper Brigade, also absorbing the parachute qualified members of the disbanded Commando Regiment. The BMI resulted from the fully mechanization of the previous 1st Composite Brigade. The BLI would be a completely newly raised motorized infantry brigade, although inheriting part of the disbanded Special Forces Brigade. Operationally, each of the three brigades had a similar organization that included three maneuver (infantry / armoured) and one field artillery battalion, engineering, signals and services companies, an armored reconnaissance squadron and an anti-aircraft battery. Administratively however each of the brigades had completely different organizations, with the BAI being entirely maintained by the Airborne Troops Command in several of its regiments and other units spread across the country, with the BMI being entirely maintained by the Santa Margarida Military Camp concentrated in a single place and with the BLI being maintained by the several military regions in their several regiments spread across the country.|$|E

30|$|Nurses’ {{preferences}} for working shifts during the planning horizon are considered. Each nurse <b>assigns</b> a <b>number</b> to each shift in each week based on his/her interest {{to work on}} that shift during that week. Also, nurses’ {{preferences for}} weekends off are considered. Each nurse <b>assigns</b> a <b>number</b> to each weekend (i.e., Sundays) based on the nurse’ interest to be off during that weekend. In other words, {{at the beginning of each}} 28 -day period of scheduling, each nurse determines his/her preferences to work on each shift in each week and to be off in each weekend. Note that the preferences of nurses may change for different periods. Numbers 7, 3, and 1 correspond to the high, medium, and low preference, respectively. If a nurse prefers to work on a specific shift, she <b>assigns</b> <b>number</b> 7 to that shift. If she has no preference, she <b>assigns</b> <b>number</b> 3 to that shift, and finally, if she does not want to work in a specific shift, she <b>assigns</b> <b>number</b> 1 to that shift. The same approach is used for choosing the weekends by the nurses as well.|$|R
