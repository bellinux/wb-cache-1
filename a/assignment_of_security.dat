40|$|The {{elaboration}} of requirements {{is a crucial}} step {{in the development of}} software-intensive security-critical application. From this stage on, the security engineering process heads towards the implementation of the identified security requirements. A missing, inadequate, imprecise or inconsistent requirement might cause the resulting application to have vulnerabilities, despite the huge amount of work that might be invested in implementing the elaborated security requirements. Vulnerabilities in requirements models notably arise from incompleteness and inconsistency. Incompleteness refers to missing requirements; inconsistency refers to requirements prescribing incompatible behaviors. Inconsistent requirements might give rise to vulnerabilities because they cannot be enforced altogether: one of them will be violated at run time. This thesis proposes three techniques for assisting engineers in the {{elaboration of}} complete and consistent requirements through model-based analysis. The two first focus on completeness issues, the last one on consistency. The three techniques build on a specific model-based framework for goal-oriented requirements analysis. They are demonstrated through models of an e-purse system and an e-signature system. The first technique is a formal framework for specifying and analyzing confidentiality concerns. Our framework makes it possible to discover confidentiality violations at requirements engineering time through model checking. The second technique focuses on the responsibility <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> requirements. Some agents in the software or in its environment might be malicious or too vulnerable. One should not rely on them in the enforcement of security goals. This technique introduces a security-specific completeness criterion ensuring that the enforcement of security goals only depends on the behavior of agents that are known to be trustworthy or built to be trustworthy. A systematic process is proposed for elaborating requirements models complying with this criterion. The third technique makes it possible to automatically detect goal-level inconsistencies called divergences. Divergences between goals lead to inconsistencies between requirements, and to potential vulnerabilities in the running system. (FSA 3) [...] UCL, 200...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{methods to}} solve the {{practical}} problems related to the information security system design in multipurpose distributed systems often use optimization models. The paper formulates a problem statement of bilinear Boolean programming with the quality score that determines {{the level of the}} system security to select classes of protected objects in distributed systems and allocate databases in these objects. Restrictions specify the maximum cost of protection and the recommended amount of data stored in the object. To solve this problem, using the algorithms of discrete programming is possible, but the accurate algorithms, generally, are exponentially timeconsuming. To find a solution the paper proposes to interpret this problem as a problem of two players with non-conflicting interests. The first player is responsible for the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> classes for the system objects, and the second player is responsible for the distribution of databases between the objects. To find solutions the use of a Nash equilibrium criterion is offered. To find the equilibrium solution is developed an algorithm and are proved its convergence, {{and the fact that it}} really allows us to obtain the Nash equilibrium position. Using the problem-solving approach related to reducing the original optimization problem to a two-player game with nonconflicting interests allowed a decreasing dimension of the original problem, because at each step of the algorithm is solved the problem of discrete optimization of a smaller dimension than the original problem of Boolean programming. The paper presents results of solving the problem, as well as research results on the time complexity of represented algorithms. It conducts a comparative analysis of the two approaches: an approach based on solving a discrete optimization problem and an approach based on reducing the problem to a two-player game with non-conflicting interests. An approach based on reducing the initial problem to a game, allowed us to decrease solution time significantly, by 2 - 3  orders, while, in general, the reached value was the same as in the original problem of Boolean programming. </p...|$|E

40|$|Dynamic {{information}} flow tracking (also known as taint tracking) is an appealing approach to combat various security attacks. However, the runtime performance can be severely degraded without efficient hardware support. This paper observes that {{information flow}} tracking can be efficiently emulated using deferred exception tracking in microprocessors supporting speculative execution. Based on the observation, we propose SHIFT, a low-overhead, software-based dynamic information flow tracking system {{to detect a}} wide range of attacks. The key idea is to treat tainted state (describing untrusted data) as speculative state (describing deferred exceptions). SHIFT leverages existing architectural support for speculative execution to automatically propagate tainted state in registers and needs only to maintain tainted state in memory (using a bitmap), which results in significant performance advantages. Moreover, by decoupling mechanisms for taint tracking from the <b>assignments</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> policies, SHIFT can detect a wide range <b>of</b> <b>security</b> exploits including high-level semantic attacks. By leveraging existing speculative hardware, we have implemented a prototype system on Itanium using GCC. A security assessment shows that SHIFT can detect both low-level memory corruption exploits as well as high-level semantic attacks with no known false positives. Performance measurements show that SHIFT incurs about 1 % overhead for server applications. The performance slowdown for SPEC-INT 2000 is 2. 81 X and 2. 27 X for tracking at byte-level and word-level respectively. An investigation also shows that some minor architectural improvements to Itanium, that is, adding three simple instructions can further reduce the performance slowdown down to 2. 32 X and 1. 8 X for byte-level and word-level tracking, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Legal systems {{around the}} world vary widely in how they deal with the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> receivables. This legal variety makes it {{difficult}} for financiers to conduct their international receivables financing business. This thesis suggests an International Registration System for the <b>Assignment</b> and <b>Security</b> Interest <b>of</b> Receivables (‘IRSAR’) and proposes a model international convention for the IRSAR (‘proposed IRSAR Convention’), which could help financiers to overcome the obstacles they currently encounter. Under the proposed IRSAR Convention, the international <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> receivables would be regulated by a unified legal system with respect to priority and perfection. The IRSAR would facilitate international project financing. Furthermore, the IRSAR would enable companies to raise finance from greater ranges of investors {{around the world}} through international receivables financing and to dispose of non-performing loans more easily. The proposed IRSAR Convention would succeed the UN Convention on the <b>Assignment</b> <b>of</b> Receivables in International Trade in the attempt of establishing a registration system for international <b>assignments</b> <b>of</b> receivables. The proposed IRSAR Convention confines its scope of application by defining the assignor (or the security provider), inventing the concept of ‘Vehicle for the International Registration System’ (‘VIRS’). The proposed IRSAR Convention applies where the assignor or security provider is a VIRS. An <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> a receivable where the assignor is a VIRS and a security interest in a receivable where the security provider is a VIRS could be registered in the IRSAR. Under the proposed IRSAR Convention, priority <b>of</b> <b>assignments</b> <b>of</b> and <b>security</b> interests in receivables is determined by the order of registration in the IRSAR. The proposed IRSAR Convention would be a receivables version of the Cape Town Convention. With respect to the contents and effect of registration, it would prescribe a notice-filing system along the lines of that adopted in the UCC Article 9. With respect to the operation of the registration, it would adopt an automatic online registration system operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year like the International Registry under the Cape Town Convention.
