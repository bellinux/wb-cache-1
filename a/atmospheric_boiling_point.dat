50|$|An {{interesting}} {{property of}} heat pipes is the temperature range over {{which they are}} effective. Initially, it might be suspected that a water-charged heat pipe only works when the hot end reaches the boiling point (100 °C, 212 °F, at normal atmospheric pressure) and steam is transferred to the cold end. However, the boiling point of water depends on the absolute pressure inside the pipe. In an evacuated pipe, water vaporizes from its triple point (0.01 °C, 32 °F) to its critical point (374 °C; 705 °F), {{as long as the}} heat pipe contains both liquid and vapor. Thus a heat pipe can operate at hot-end temperatures as low as just slightly warmer than the melting point of the working fluid, although the maximum rate of heat transfer is low at temperatures below 25 °C (77 °F). Similarly, a heat pipe with water as a working fluid can work well above the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> (100 °C, 212 °F). The maximum temperature for long term water heat pipes is 270 °C (518 °F), with heat pipes operating up to 300 °C (572 °F) for short term tests.|$|E

In this paper, spray properties in an operating furnace were studied with the unique furnace endoscope developed at the HUT. The velocity, the shape {{and the length of}} the black liquor sheet were measured with this furnace endoscope in five operating recovery boiler furnaces by using a multiple exposure CCD-camera and an image-analysis-system.

When flashing occurs, the sheet velocity may be accelerated by a factor of 3. 4.

When the liquor sheet was formed, two main sheet break-up mechanisms were observed, i. e. perforated-sheet disintegration and wave disintegration. In the case of flashing, the sheet break-up mechanism was different. The comparison between results from the test chamber and furnace showed that the spray properties in both environments depend on same main parameters, i. e. on the difference between the firing temperature and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> {{as well as on the}} mass flux...|$|E

With proper experimental design and especially proper stirring, the measured temperature of typical organic reaction mixtures heated at reflux will be close to the normal boiling point temperature of the solvent, whether heated using microwave radiation or conventional convective heat transfer. These observations are important to take into consideration when comparing reaction rates under conventional and microwave heating...|$|E

As a consequence, whereas in chemical explosions the expansion ratio is about 8, it can reach 1700 for steam explosions. Steam explosions embrace very different phenomena such as Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosions (BLEVE) or Molten Material in contact With water (MMWW). BLEVE is an explosive vaporization that can happen if a pressure vessel containing water at a temperature above its <b>atmospheric</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> catastrophically fails.

This latest phenomenon results from an almost instantaneous heat transfer from the molten material to the cold water causing explosive vapor generation. Although chemical reaction can play a role for some of the most reactive molten materials, it is widely accepted that its contribution is not required to explain the magnitude of the destructive steam explosion forces. MMWW is commonly divided into four successive steps: premixing of melt and coolant, triggering of the explosion, explosion propagation and finally work production. A steam film interface is formed when a hot material enters in contact with a coolant. The local film collapse is responsible for triggering the steam explosion through molten material fragmentation. Fragmentation offers a large heat exchange area to allow the instantaneous heat transfer to take place...|$|E
40|$|Available online 14 September 2011 Article in pressInternational audienceThe {{precipitation}} of natrojarosite from iron {{sodium sulfate}} solutions {{has been investigated}} at temperatures close to the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>point,</b> in batch and semi-batch conditions. Semi-batch conditions {{make it possible to}} maintain a weaker iron concentration in the stirred reactor, leading to lower supersaturations, closer to those in continuous and possibly seeded MSMPRs or tanks-in series units. In these reactors, primary and secondary nucleations are few, allowing the growth of pure mono-crystalline particles of controlled size and size dispersion. Both modi operandi lead to agglomerates made of crystals of cubic habit. The surface of cauliflower-like particles from the batch modus operandi displays overlaying crystals, of size between 100 and 400 nm. The particles from the semi-batch mode, with moderate iron addition, are rougher and show bigger intergrown constitutive crystals of size up to a few microns, which denotes lesser secondary nucleation and more growth. A model is developed to characterize iron(III) and sulfate speciation with non-ideal behavior in the mother solution. It is used to compare the variations of supersaturation in the reactor between the batch and the semi-batch conditions. During the first 500 min, the supersaturation resulting from a moderate addition of iron is 10, 000 - 10 times lower than during batch kinetics, which agrees with the reduction of secondary nucleation suggested by scanning electron micrographs. The semi-batch technique, which can be combined with the addition of support particles, is worth further work, aiming to reduce secondary nucleation and to determine the crystallite growth rate expression of natrojarosite as a function of supersaturation, using the model of solution developed in this work...|$|E

40|$|Impulse {{technology}} is {{a process in which}} water is removedfrom a wet paper web by the combined action of mechanicalpressure and intense heat. This results in increased dewateringrates, increased smoothness on the roll side of the sheet, andincreased density. Although the potential benefits of impulsepressing have been debated over the past thirty years, itsindustrial acceptance has been prevented by web delamination,which is defined as a reduction in the z-directional strengthof paper. This thesis deals with the mechanism of heat transfer withphase change during impulse pressing of wet paper. The resultsof four complementary experimental studies suggest that littleor no steam is formed in an impulse nip prior to the point ofmaximum applied load. As the nip is unloaded and the hydraulicpressure decreases, hot liquid water flashes to steam. Weadvance the argument that the force expressed upon flashing canbe used to displace liquid water, in a mechanism similar tothat originally proposed by Wahren. Additionally, modelexperiments performed in a novel experimental facility suggestthat the strength of flashing-assisted displacement dewateringcan be maximized by controlling the direction of steam venting. If this solution could be exploited in a commercially viableimpulse press, delamination would cease to be an issue ofconcern. The thesis includes a study of the web structure ofdelaminated paper. Here, we characterized delaminated paper bythe changes in transverse permeability and cross-sectionalsolidity profiles measured as a function of pressingtemperature. We found no evidence that wet pressing and impulsepressing induced stratification in non-delaminated sheets andconcluded that the parabolic solidity profiles observed weredue to capillary forces present during drying. Further, thepermeability of mechanically compressed never-dried samples wasfound to be essentially constant for pressing temperatureslower than the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of water and toincrease significantly at higher pressing temperatures.

At present, the interest in biorefinery is growing, due to environmental awareness and the depletion of fossil resources. Biomass from agricultural and forestry industries {{has proven to be}} excellent raw material for different processes. Biorefinering valuable species such as bioactive species from biomass, without compromising the primary process of the biomass is highly desirable. Pressurised fluid extraction (PFE) using water and ethanol as a solvent was developed for extracting betulin from birch (Betula pendula) bark. Apart from betulin, stilbene glucosides such as astringin, isorhapontin and picied were also extracted from spruce (Picea abies) using PFE. PFE is an advanced technique that extracts at temperatures above the solvent’s <b>atmospheric</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>point.</b> The applied pressure in PFE is mainly to maintain the liquid state of the extraction solvent. Parameters such as type of solvent, temperature, and time affect the extraction selectivity and efficiency. Therefore it is necessary to comprehend these parameters in order to optimise extraction. The DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) assay was used to determine the antioxidant capacity and activity of the obtained bioactive species. The results showed high antioxidant capacity in bioactive species that were extracted at an elevated temperature, 180 °C. Extraction and degradation occur simultaneously during the extraction. Hence, it is crucial to separate these two processes in order to obtain the actual value. An online hyphenated system of chromatographic separation electrochemical mass spectrometric detection was developed (LC-DAD-ECD-MS/MS). The electrochemical detector facilitates real-time monitoring of the antioxidant capacity and activity of each antioxidant and its oxidation products. This developed LC-DAD-ECD-MS/MS method enabled rapid screening of antioxidants and created a fingerprint map for their oxidation products. Characterisation and molecular elucidation of bioactive species were also performed. Degradation of bioactive species was investigated with the said online system and birch bark extract was compared with birch bark extracts that were hydrothermally treated. The obtained results showed some degradation of antioxidants at 180 °C. In summary, the aim of this thesis was to develop analytical methods integrated with sustainable chemistry for extraction of bioactive species in biomass from the forestry industry. A novel online system using selective and sensitive detectors such as diode-array, electrochemical, and tandem mass spectrometry was developed to rapidly determine the antioxidant capacity and activity of antioxidants. Furthermore, tandem mass spectrometry enables identification of unknown bioactive species without the need of reference samples.
