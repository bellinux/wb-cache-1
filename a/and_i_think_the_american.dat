6000|$|I can say conscientiously, {{that were}} {{my life to}} be passed over again, without the hope of {{commanding}} a vessel, it should be passed in the navy. The food is better, the service is lighter, the treatment is better, if a man behave himself at all well, he is better cared for, has a port under his lee in case of accidents, and gets good, steady, wages, with the certainty of being paid. If his ship is lost, his wages are safe; and if he gets hurt, he is pensioned. Then he is pretty certain of having gentlemen over him, {{and that is a}} great deal for any man. He has good quarters below; and if he serve in a ship as large as a frigate, he has a cover over his head, half the time, at least, in bad weather. This is the honest opinion of one who has served in all sorts of crafts, liners, Indiamen, coasters, smugglers, whalers, and transient ships. I have been in a ship of the line, two frigates, three sloops of war, and several smaller craft; and such is the result of all my experience in Uncle Sam's navy. No man can go to sea and always meet with fair-weather, but he will get as little of foul in one of our vessels of war, as in any craft that floats, if a man only behave himself. I think the American merchantmen give better wages than {{are to be found in}} other services; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> men-of-war, as a rule, give better treatment than the American merchantman. God bless the flag, I say, and this, too, without the fear of being hanged! ...|$|E
5000|$|The 9/11 truth {{movement}} {{became an}} issue in the 2010 Texas Gubernatorial Republican primary when candidate Debra Medina replied when asked by Glenn Beck about US government involvement in the 9/11 attacks: [...] "I think some very good questions have been raised in that regard, there are some very good arguments, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> people have not seen all of the evidence there, so I have not taken a position on that." [...] After being criticized for the remarks by opposing candidates, Medina said that she has never been a 9/11 truth movement member and believes the twin towers were attacked by Muslim terrorists.|$|E
5000|$|Later that month, U.S. President Barack Obama was {{dismissive of}} Snowden, saying, [...] "I'm {{not going to}} be {{scrambling}} jets to get a 29-year-old hacker." [...] In early August, Obama said that Snowden was no patriot and that Americans {{would have been better off}} if they had remained unaware of the NSA surveillance activities that Snowden revealed. Obama also said that he had [...] "called for a thorough review of our surveillance operations before Mr. Snowden made these leaks.... My preference, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> people's preference, would have been for a lawful, orderly examination of these laws; a thoughtful fact-based debate that would then lead us to a better place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly, teacher. Oh, you DO know. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> violets {{are little}} snips {{of the sky}} that fell down when the angels cut out holes for the stars to shine through. And the {{buttercups}} are made out of old sunshine; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> sweet peas will be butterflies {{when they go to}} heaven. Now, teacher, do you see anything so very queer about those thoughts?" ...|$|R

5000|$|In August 2013, President Obama {{said that}} he had called for a review of U.S. {{surveillance}} activities before Snowden had begun revealing details of the NSA's operations: [...] "My preference, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> people's preference, would have been for a lawful, orderly examination of these laws; a thoughtful fact-based debate that would then lead us to a better place." [...] Obama announced that he was directing DNI James Clapper [...] "to establish a review group on intelligence and communications technologies" [...] that would brief and later report to Obama. In December, the task force issued 46 recommendations that, if adopted, would subject the NSA to additional scrutiny by the courts, Congress, and the president, and would strip the NSA of the authority to infiltrate American computer systems using [...] "backdoors" [...] in hardware or software. Panel member Geoffrey R. Stone said {{there was no evidence that}} the bulk collection of phone data had stopped any terror attacks. In July 2014, The Washington Post reported that, according to a large cache of NSA-intercepted conversations provided by Edward Snowden, months of tracking by the NSA of communications across more than 50 alias Internet accounts [...] "led directly to the 2011 capture in Abbottabad of Muhammad Tahir Shahzad, a Pakistan-based bomb builder, and Umar Patek, a suspect in a 2002 terrorist bombing on the Indonesian island of Bali." [...] The Post said that, at the request of CIA officials, it was [...] "withholding other examples that officials said would compromise ongoing operations." ...|$|E
60|$|It was the sublimest {{spectacle}} <b>I</b> ever witnessed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{memory of}} it will remain with me always.|$|R
6000|$|... "I understand, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> plan good--for you--and yet, Baas, {{there is}} one thing that I have not told you which may mar it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her voice changed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{last part}} was {{intended}} to have its meaning, but a sudden impulse overcame my reason, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> answered rashly: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Jerry, [...] "the Laughing Brook {{has stopped}} laughing, and the Smiling Pool has stopped smiling, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> world is upside down." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was only}} wisdom, for we were nearing Swanston. I rose. [...] "Miss Gilchrist, {{you are a}} good woman; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> cleverest <b>I</b> have met." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{know what}} you <b>think,</b> Dick-- <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> same-- that that man {{was the one who}} aided Crabtree to escape from jail," [...] said Sam.|$|R
60|$|None {{of their}} {{children}} were then above six years old; they were all fruitful enough; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> cook's mate's wife was big of her sixth child.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jack," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "there is Bill Haden {{fighting}} his old bitch Flora against Tom Walker's Jess, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> pup is a-killing the old dorg." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'In great trouble, Dorcas. Captain Wybrow, Sir Christopher's nephew, you know, {{has died}} suddenly. Miss Sarti found him lying dead, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> shock has {{affected}} her mind.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Equal, for and against," [...] he announced. [...] "I have {{a casting}} vote, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{importance}} of the matter justifies my using it. I declare the motion lost." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, faith, betwixt the two," [...] said Mowbray, [...] "I own I {{should have}} {{preferred}} my own name, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> old gentleman's taste rather {{better than the}} young one's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir, thank you; I {{am going}} this moment myself; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> sooner you go the better. I will fetch your {{greatcoat}} {{and open the}} garden door for you." ...|$|R
30|$|People {{come here}} and they do better work, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{environment}} is one piece of it. We call the green carpet “The Green Carpet of Candor.” That helps quite a bit.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} delighted," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "to have {{you make a}} choice for me; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> list would be the better plan, because books would be so heavy to carry about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> see a {{path through}} yonder trees," [...] said Ben, {{pointing}} to his left. [...] "The ground seems to be pretty good there, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> opening is plenty large enough for our cars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I had {{intended}} {{you to go}} to St. Andrews next year, Malcolm, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> best plan will be for you to go there at once. As you say, Duncan can look after the place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{your way}} of thinking, is it, Jack. Well, I thank you, old one, for the hint, but have little fear of that craft. We've had our legs together, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> brig has the longest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{a pretty}} color, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> curls much nicer than a boughten switch," [...] said Becky, quite {{unconscious}} {{that her own}} luxuriant locks were of the true Titian red, and would be much admired by artistic eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's true, though I {{hardly know}} him," [...] she {{answered}} with a smile. [...] "One is now and then seized by a quick prejudice, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> reason <b>I</b> mentioned the man was because I wanted your opinion." ...|$|R
30|$|Leah: <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{specialist}} model – {{especially for}} intermediate – because there’s {{so many things}} that teachers have to know really deeply that making change is hard when you’re trying to make change in so many different subject areas.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is a {{stranded}} steamer somewhere up a creek {{behind that}} island, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{men who are}} trying to salve her have a good many difficulties to contend with. Among other things, I fancy the niggers are worrying them." ...|$|R
5000|$|During a June 9, 2009 interview, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., the new {{chairman}} of GM, said, [...] "I don’t know anything about cars ...

5000|$|... "There is {{room for}} the Fed to create a bubble in housing prices, if necessary, to sustain American hedonism. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Fed has the will to do so, even though {{political}} correctness would demand that Mr. Greenspan deny any such thing." ...|$|R
60|$|One of {{the bankers}} subscribed five {{thousand}} dollars, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> other one subscribed half as much, but I {{do not remember}} with certainty now whether that was the figure or not. We got designs made--some of them came from Paris.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll be in inside ten minutes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Madeira boat {{has still}} her anchor down," [...] he said. [...] "I {{had to give}} the {{quartermaster}} orders to have our lancha ready, and he'll take any passengers straight across to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 4. In finance {{some are}} for movement, some {{stationary}} or retrograde {{so as to}} be ready for immediate war. Yet here we are not divided simply as combative or anti-combative. The onward men in finance are: Lord John Russell, Duke of Newcastle, Granville, Argyll, Gibson, W.E.G., <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> chancellor. The stationary men are, first and foremost: Sir George Lewis, Sir C. Wood; next to these, Lord Palmerston, Cardwell, <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> Villiers, Herbert.|$|R
5000|$|Burgess later said, [...] "Strange Times is my favourite. Personally, I {{believe it}} was the best lyrical work I'd done with the band and some of the best vocal performances, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Chameleons really began to mature and move forward with this album".|$|R
5000|$|Vernon Castle {{said of the}} maxixe in his 1914 book Modern Dancing, [...] "The steps {{themselves}} are not difficult; on the contrary, they are childishly simple; it is the easiest dance of all to do, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> hardest of all to do well." ...|$|R
