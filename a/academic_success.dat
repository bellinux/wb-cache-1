5|$|Delayed gratification, or {{deferred}} gratification, is {{the ability}} to resist the temptation for an immediate reward and wait for a later reward. Generally, delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate reward in order to receive a larger or more enduring reward later.

5|$|Brasenose lost 115 {{men in the}} First World War (including {{a quarter}} of the 1913 year), with its {{undergraduate}} numbers greatly reduced. Lord Curzon's post-War reforms were successfully instituted. The inter-war period was defined by William Stallybrass, who as fellow and eventual Principal (until 1948) dominated college life. Brasenose once again produced top sportsmen– cricketers, rowers, and others. This came at the cost of falling academic standards and poorly performing finances, which would see Stallybrass' authority challenged. He died in a railway accident before he could be forced out, however. After the war, sporting achievements waned (although there were notable exceptions) but <b>academic</b> <b>success</b> did not improve significantly, in what was now one of Oxford's largest colleges.|$|E
5|$|Cruttwell {{was born}} on 23 May 1887, {{in the village of}} Denton, Norfolk, the eldest of three sons of the Rev. Charles Thomas Cruttwell, Rector of St Mary's Church.

Cruttwell was educated at Rugby School, where in 1906 he won a scholarship to Queen's College, Oxford, to read classics and history. At Queen's, Cruttwell enjoyed considerable <b>academic</b> <b>success,</b> including a first class honours degree in modern history. In 1911 he was elected to a fellowship at All Souls College and a year later was appointed to a history lectureship at Hertford College.|$|E

5|$|Jan Smuts {{was born}} in 1870, the second son of a {{traditional}} Boer farming family. By rural tradition, the eldest son {{would be the only}} child to receive a full formal education; however, on the death of his elder brother in 1882, 12-year-old Jan was sent to school for the first time. After four years of education he had made exceptional progress, gaining admission to study at Victoria College in Stellenbosch. He graduated in 1891 with first-class honours in Literature and Science. With this strong academic background, he applied for, and won, the Ebden scholarship for overseas study, electing to read Law at Christ's College, Cambridge. After further <b>academic</b> <b>success,</b> and the recipient of many prestigious academic awards, he graduated in 1894 with double First-class honours. After graduating, Smuts passed the examinations for the Inns of Court, entering the Middle Temple. In 1895, despite the prospect of a bright future in the United Kingdom, the homesick Smuts returned to South Africa.|$|E
5|$|The post-1785 period {{would see}} {{an era of}} {{prosperity}} of the college under Principal William Cleaver. The college began to be populated by gentlemen, its income doubling between 1790 and 1810, and <b>academic</b> <b>success</b> considerable. Efforts to reconstruct Brasenose were not completed, however, until {{the second half of}} the century with the addition of New Quad between 1886 and 1911. Brasenose's financial position remained secure, although under the tenure of Principal Edward Hartopp Cradock Brasenose's academic record waned greatly, with much of its success focussed on sports– where it excelled most notably in cricket and rowing. The mid-Century Royal Commissions were navigated– although they were opposed in form, their recommendations welcomed including the submission of accounts. The election of Charles Buller Heberden as Principal in 1889 led to a reversal in Brasenose's academic failures, although its sporting performance suffered. Heberden was the first lay Principal, presiding over an increasingly secular college, opening up the library to undergraduates, instituting an entrance exam for the first time and accepting Rhodes scholarships.|$|E
