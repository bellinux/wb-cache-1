40|$|The {{interaction}} of xenon with copper/ 6 -hydroxydopa (2, 4, 5 -trihydroxyphenethylamine) quinone (TPQ) amine oxidases {{from the plant}} pulses lentil (Lens esculenta) and pea (Pisum sativum) (seedlings), the perennial Mediterranean shrub Euphorbia characias (latex), and the mammals cattle (serum) and pigs (kidney), were investigated by NMR and optical spectroscopy of the aqueous solutions of the enzymes. (129) Xe chemical shift provided evidence of xenon binding {{to one or more}} cavities of all these enzymes, and optical spectroscopy showed that under 10 atm of xenon gas, {{and in the absence of}} a substrate, the plant enzyme cofactor (TPQ), is converted into its reduced semiquinolamine radical. The kinetic parameters of the analyzed plant amine oxidases showed that the k(c) value of the xenon-treated enzymes was reduced by 40 %. Moreover, whereas the measured K(m) value for oxygen and for the aromatic monoamine benzylamine was shown to be unchanged, the K(m) value for the diamine putrescine increased remarkably after the addition of xenon. Under the same experimental conditions, the TPQ of bovine serum amine oxidase maintained its oxidized form, whereas in pig kidney, the reduced <b>aminoquinol</b> species was formed without the radical species. Moreover the k(c) value of the xenon-treated pig enzyme in the presence of both benzylamine and cadaverine was shown to be dramatically reduced. It is proposed that the lysine residue at the active site of amine oxidase could be involved both in the formation of the reduced TPQ and in controlling catalytic activity...|$|E
