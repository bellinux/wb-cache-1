40|$|XIV th ICAZ Remains Working Group MeetingSturgeon {{lived in}} the Rhöne river (France) until its {{complete}} extinction in the mid 1970 's. Usually attributed to <b>Acipenser</b> <b>sturio,</b> it disappeared without certitude about species identity and about possible sympatry between <b>Acipenser</b> <b>sturio</b> and <b>Acipenser</b> naccarii as it occured in the Pô (Italy) and Guadalquivir (Spain) rivers. Genetic analyses on several sturgeon bone remains from the Arles' Jardin d'Hiver collection {{have been carried out}} to solve this question. These remains belong to sturgeons caught in the Rhône river. The mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome b) sequences clearly show that A. sturio lived in this river.

We {{did not find}} this stDNA in the genome of the Atlantic sturgeon <b>Acipenser</b> <b>sturio</b> L., 1758. The comparison of sturgeon species us-ing the HindIII stDNA revealed the following: (1) A. naccarii and A. baerii are closely related; (2) H. huso appears {{to belong to the}} genus Acipenser and, probably, Huso is not a separate genus with-in the Acipenserinae; (3) A. sturio differs from the other three studied species by the absence of the HindIII stDNA and, most likely, it represents a separate evolutionary lineage within the Acipenseridae. The data on the HindIII stDNA can be successfully used for species identification of sturgeon specimens captured in different European regions.

From May 1998 to March 1999, the stomach contents of 61 juveniles were collected by gastric lavage. The fish were caught during monthly trawling campaigns to monitor sturgeon migration in the Gironde estuary (southwestern France). Specimens were mainly caught during spring and summer in two areas of increased abundance. The gastric lavage method used had been previously tested on Siberian sturgeon Acipenser baerii Brandt, 1869 in captivity. Twelve taxa of prey were found.

A large number of Dutch, Belgian, British and some French archaeological sturgeon remains, dating from the Mesolithic up to Late Modern times, are morphologically examined and fish sizes are reconstructed. This study of > 7000 acipenserid bones proves the sympatric occurrence of European sturgeon A. sturio and Atlantic sturgeon A. oxyrinchus in the southern North Sea at least since the Neolithic (fourth millennium BC onwards), with A. oxyrinchus remains always outnumbering those of A. sturio.

In order to restore ecosystems’ functionality and save the Giant Pearl Mussel from extinction, we suggest the reintroduction of a similar species: the Atlantic Sturgeon A. oxyrinchus. This species is the least threatened of the Acipenseridae and was present in France at least between 3 000 BC and 200 AD. The interspecific competition risk with the European Sturgeon, as well as the introgression risk, can be eliminated as both species have coexisted in the past.

Anglers and estuary netsmen have taken these fish to over 20 lb (9 kg) in weight. In summer and autumn there is also a substantial run of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). In May the Towy has a run of the rare and protected twaite shad (Alosa fallax) and allis shad (Alosa alosa). The Towy also contains brown trout, eels, pike, and a variety of small fish species, and is home to brook lampreys, river lampreys and sea lampreys.The Towy has the distinction of having accidentally produced by far the biggest fish ever taken on rod and line in fresh water in Britain.

These sister species form a separate clade within the genus Acipenser and {{appear to be the}} most basal clade with respect to all other species of the genus. Intraspecifically, at least two different genetic forms have been found within A. sturio (in the Northern and Baltic seas), but no defined subspecies exist.

The dermal bones of A. sturio are said to have an exterior surface pattern consisting of tubercles, while those of A. oxyrinchus are said to display alveoli. In the present paper, the validity of the surface pattern as a species-specific characteristic is critically assessed. To this purpose, dermal plates from modern, genetically identified museum specimens were studied and the surface morphology observed in a series of archaeological remains was compared with the genetic identifications obtained on these same remains. The analyses show that the surface pattern of dermal bones is related to the size of the individual, with the pattern of small A. oxyrinchus being similar to that of A. sturio. In addition, variations in the surface pattern among the bones of a single individual and within the same bone have been observed. These findings explain previous conflicting results between morphological and genetic identifications and allow the formulation of some recommendations for more accurate morphological identification of isolated archaeological sturgeon dermal bones...|$|R

The Atlantic sturgeon <b>Acipenser</b> <b>sturio</b> L., 1758 in Poland was originally found in the Vistula and Oder Rivers and their tributaries, to the upper parts of their watercourses. Over the following centuries, its range has been greatly reduced, and by the mid- 1960 s it had completely disappeared from Polish waters. The last sturgeon {{were caught in the}} lower Vistula River in 1965. Today, the species is con-sidered extirpated. From the Middle Ages, the Atlantic sturgeon was intensively caught in rivers and lagoons, mainly by floating nets. The period of maximum fishery exploitation in the lower Vistula River and Gulf of Gdansk was about 1500, and the first symptoms of sturgeon overex-ploitation occurred around 1600. The main reasons for stock decline in Polish rivers are, chrono-logically: (1) long-term overexploitation; (2) water extraction; (3) hydraulic engineering (in-cluding stream regulations, damming and construction of harbours; and (4) industrial and agricultural pollution.

Hunting, fowling, fishing and agriculture did not have much influence on wild stocks in the period from the late Bronze Age/early Iron Age until the late Middle Ages. However, large changes to the landscape were made in the late Middle Ages by diking and damming. As a result, some species such as the northern vole (Microtus oeconomus) and the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) disappeared from the area except for some dune districts on the islands, and others became rare, such as the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) and the lagoon cockle (Cerastoderma lamarcki). New habitats arose for birds of dry meadows and fields, like lapwing (Vanellus vanellus) and black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa).

40|$|Different {{traditional}} and geometric morphometric approaches are explored {{for the size}} reconstruction of European (<b>Acipenser</b> <b>sturio)</b> and Atlantic sturgeon (A. oxyrinchus) {{on the basis of}} isolated bony scutes. The relationship between fish length and different scute measurements was tested with linear regressions using 58 modern sturgeons from museum collections. As the accuracy of this approach was limited, we explored the possibility of determining the position of an isolated scute within its row {{on the basis of its}} shape or dimension. In the dorsal and lateral rows, the shape and dimension of the scutes change along the antero-posterior axis, but this difference is too gradual to allow establishing the original position of an isolated scute within the row. No consistent changes in the shape or dimensions of ventral scutes were observed according to their place within the row. Differences in scute shape or dimensions between large and small animals have been documented as well, but these differences were not sufficiently pronounced for an accurate estimation of size. We conclude that isolated scutes cannot provide very accurate fish length reconstructions. However, the regression models presented in this study, allow verifying whether individual lateral and dorsal scutes belonged to sturgeons larger than 1 m total length. In that case they can be identified to species level on the basis of their surface ornamentation, which is size dependent...|$|R

Pseudorasbora parva and Leuciscus cephalus, together with the Padano-Venetian Chondrostoma genei and Padogobius bonelli. Native species still present included Leuciscus lucumonis, Telestes muticellus, Rutilus rubilio and Padogobius nigricans, but were now more restricted to upper reaches and smaller watercourses. The deleterious effect of alien species on native forms is discussed with particular reference to probable competition between C. genei and L. lucumonis, and between the two gobies. The checklist of species introduced to the fresh waters of Italy is now, updated to 34. For the Italian freshwater fish fauna in general, the conservation status of three native species (Acipenser naccari, Salmo marmoratus and Knipowitschia punctatissima) has been improved but five species are believed to he at risk (Salmo carpio, L lucumonis, Scardinius scardafa, Gobio benacensis and P. nigricans) and four anadromous species (Petromyzon murinus, Lampetra fluviatilis, <b>Acipenser</b> <b>sturio</b> and Huso huso) no longer breed in Italian fresh waters. The processes of change in the composition of the Italian freshwater fish fauna as a whole may be summarized as successively 'padanization', 'danubization' and now 'globalization'.

40|$|Four {{sturgeon}} {{species have}} been reported to exist in Greek waters: the Atlantic sturgeon, the great sturgeon, the stellate sturgeon and the Adriatic sturgeon. The Atlantic sturgeon <b>Acipenser</b> <b>sturio</b> L., 1758 has an almost regular presence in the Evros River (Aegean Sea), and is rather rare in the Pinios and Acheloos Rivers. The great sturgeon or beluga Huso huso L., 1758 is suspected to be an occasional visitor in Greek waters, or it is a case of undocumented information. The presence of the stellate sturgeon Acipenser stellatus Pallas, 1771 has been recently verified by a specimen caught close to the Thracian shore. The Adriatic sturgeon Acipenser naccarii Bonaparte, 1836 is supposed to have its southern distribution limits in the waters around the island of Corfu, although this information has never been confirmed. The distribution of these species is obvi-ously related to salinity, probably prohibiting the extension of other sturgeon species to the Mediterranean, except for A. sturio. The discontinuous distribution of H. huso and A. stellatus may be a result of sea-level changes, while salinity played some role in the last period of glaciation. In the marine area of the Evros River A. sturio has been economically significant until 1975, sup-porting a small black caviar industry. Since then, the species has become rare mainly because of overfishing, and the reduction and pollution of the Evros River, in the upstream of which some important sturgeon spawning sites have been located...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{aim of the}} LIFE MIGRATOEBRE project (LIFE 13 NAT/ES/ 000237) is {{to promote}} the {{recovery}} of ecological connectivity within 10 - 20 years in the lower Ebre River and Delta (in a stretch of 115 km from the Mediterranean Sea), and a healthy and sustainable population of migrating fish: European sturgeon (<b>Acipenser</b> <b>sturio),</b> European eel (Anguilla anguilla), twaite shad (Alosa fallax) and sea lamprey (Petromizon marinus), among others native species. It is focused on long-term sustainable investments adapting all present river obstacles to allow fish migration (upstream and downstream); increasing twice the river spawning habitat availability, and the distribution and growth areas of migrating fish. Main activities of the LIFE MIGRATOEBRE project are: 1. Apply ship locks fish-friendly improved management at Xerta’s weir (located at 58 km from the sea) and at Flix dam (located at 115 km from the sea), and to monitor it regularly. 2. Install a fish lock at Xerta’s weir, and a fish ramp at Ascó’s weir (located at 104 km from the sea), and to monitor it regularly. 3. Undertake a pilot project of European sturgeon restocking through experimental releases in the lower Ebre (downstream and upstream Xerta’s weir). 4. Develop a communication campaign and a community involvement plan for students, general public, farmers, fishermen, anglers, electric companies, tourism stakeholders, regional and local authorities. It will include {{the production of a}} great temporary exhibition, the creation of an interpretation center of fish migration in the Xerta’s ship lock house and a network of volunteers. This LIFE project started in 1 / 07 / 14 and will finish in 30 / 06 / 18. More information in: www. migratoebre. e...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{tetranucleotide}} microsatellite locus Spl- 106 {{has been}} widely used as a molecular marker in sturgeon studies. To investigate the evolutionary process of this highly variable locus in Acipenseriforms, cross-species amplifications were performed in 130 individuals from 15 species and successful in 13 species. All PCR products were sequenced. According to the flanking sequences, a total of 94 alleles at locus Spl- 106 were found in 11 out of 13 species. Twenty-three haplotypic flanking sequences were detected and four of them are dominant types present in 70 out of 94 alleles. Two of the dominant types are species-specific types, {{and the other two}} are composed of alleles from species of the Pacific and Atlantic lineages, respectively. The repeat region evolved synchronously with the flanking region. The Atlantic clade was also found in the genealogy tree of the repeat region constructed using the MS Align method. Although the basic repeat structure was variable, several alleles were highly conserved among species and evolved independently. The evolutionary process of this locus in Acipenseriforms was reconstituted from a single repeat (TAGA) n to compound repeats (TAGA) n(TAAA) m, then to another single repeat (TAAA) n, and finally to a totally new compound repeat structure (TAAA) m(GAAA) n. Reciprocally, for the sturgeon phylogeny, our results suggest that <b>Acipenser</b> <b>sturio</b> diverged earlier than Schphirhynchus platorynchus, and infirm the Huso genus, since the two Huso species are classified within the Acipenser species of the Pacific and Atlantic lineages, respectively. Moreover, the sequence information also supports the close relationship between A. sinensis and A. dabryanus, and the relationships among A. transmontanus, A. schrenckii, and H. dauricus...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{study focused}} on {{assessing}} the rehabilitation potential of the Spree-Havel River system for rheophilic and anadromous fish species using the European sturgeon <b>Acipenser</b> <b>sturio</b> as indicator species. An age-structured population model for the sturgeon {{was set up to}} predict the potential effects of different river rehabilitation scenarios on the population development. The scenarios included: 1) solely the provision of longitudinal connectivity without further habitat enhancements, 2) providing longitudinal connectivity in combination with moderate gravel addition and modified flow conditions below weirs, and 3) providing longitudinal connectivity in combination with significant riverbed modifications to create spawning habitats. All three scenarios have been calculated for four adjacent river segments of in total 220 km length allowing for cumulative assessments. The main aim of this simulation study was to identify the best solution for the combination of habitat enhancement and connectivity measures to achieve the maximum ecological improvement of riverine fish assemblages at feasible efforts. Restoration of river connectivity is the main prerequisite for the re-establishment of a variety of diadromous species including sturgeon, but by itself it will have little potential to support their populations. At least moderate improvements of the hydro-morphology and habitat structures (restoring about 30 % of the potential habitats will result in 30, 000 m² spawning habitat) will be essential for the long-term success. This rehabilitation in conjunction with longitudinal connectivity over the 220 km long river course will dramatically increase the population potential. As a result, the sturgeon population of the Havel-Spree river system could contribute an estimated share of 41 % to a potential sturgeon stock of the River Elbe catchment (148, 268 km²), accounting for 15, 400 - 42, 000 juvenile fish annually recruiting from the system and an annual return of 4, 300 - 11, 700 spawners...|$|R
