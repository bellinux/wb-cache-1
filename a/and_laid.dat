5|$|Brin had {{originally}} {{wanted to build}} three ships, but their great cost forced him to settle for two. At the time, Italy's industrial capacity was insufficient to build the ships out of domestic material. Everything from the iron used to build the hulls to the ships' machinery and guns had to be imported. The Caio Duilio class {{formed the basis for}} the following two ironclad designs, the , also designed by Brin <b>and</b> <b>laid</b> down in 1876, and the , designed by Giuseppe Micheli <b>and</b> <b>laid</b> down in 188182.|$|E

30|$|Global {{trend towards}} {{sustainable}} developments have brought natural, renewable biodegradable raw material into the focus, {{but due to}} lack of technical knowhow, {{only a small fraction of}} these non-conventional fibres are harvested and utilized. In this study we have developed parallel laid 100 % banana nonwoven fabric <b>and</b> cross <b>laid</b> banana/polypropylene (60 : 40) nonwoven fabric. Three varieties of banana fibers namely Mahalaxmi, Shrimanti and Graint Naine were used for needle punched non-woven fabric preparations. Analysis of physical properties is carried out in machine direction and cross direction. This paper concludes that cross laid nonwoven fabric show superior tensile properties as compared to parallel laid nonwoven fabric. Shrimanti fibre nonwoven fabric is stronger than Graint Naine and Mahalaxmi fibre nonwoven fabric for both the parallel <b>laid</b> <b>and</b> cross <b>laid</b> structure. Parallel laid Mahalaxmi banana nonwoven fabric <b>and</b> cross <b>laid</b> Graint Naine banana nonwoven fabric gives higher elongation% for machine and cross direction. Increased air permeability of cross laid (60 : 40) banana/polypropylene non-woven fabric observed than parallel laid 100 % banana non-woven fabric. Parallel laid Graint Naine non-woven fabric showed higher air permeability than Shrimanti <b>and</b> Mahalaxmi parallel <b>laid</b> non-woven fabric. Bursting strength of parallel laid nonwoven fabric is higher, both in the machine as well as in cross direction than cross laid nonwoven fabric for three varieties of banana fibres. Shrimanti banana non-woven fabric showed higher bursting strength for parallel <b>laid</b> <b>and</b> cross <b>laid</b> structure than Graint Naine <b>and</b> Mahalaxmi parallel <b>laid</b> <b>and</b> cross <b>laid</b> structure.|$|R

5|$|Officially ordered on 2 November 1911 <b>and</b> <b>laid</b> down {{less than}} a month later on 27 November, the first {{dreadnought}} became the largest ship that Armstrong had built.

The New York Tribune (2 November 1913) and Proceedings (May and June 1914) reported that Greece had reached an accord to purchase the first battleship counterbalance the Ottoman Empire's acquisition of Rio de Janeiro from Brazil, but despite a developing sentiment within Chile to sell {{one or both of the}} dreadnoughts, no deal was made.|$|E
