50|$|There {{were many}} others whose ideas predated Foyn's method. In 1867, a Danish {{fireworks}} manufacturer, Gaetano Amici, patented a cannon fired harpoon. An Englishman, George Welch, patented a grenade harpoon, also in 1867, {{very similar to}} Foyn's invention. In 1856, Phillip Rechten, of Bremen, Germany, together with the gunsmith Cordes, produced a double-barreled whale gun (and later claimed credit for Foyn's success) with a separate harpoon and bomb-lance. Another Norwegian, Jacob Nicolai Walsøe experimented <b>with</b> an <b>explosive</b> tipped <b>projectile</b> design.

40|$|System using {{a neutron}} sensor {{installed}} within a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) for underwater inspection has been developed. The system can inspect objects {{for the presence}} of threat materials, such as explosives and chemical agents, by using alpha particle tagged neutrons from a sealed tube d+t neutron generator to produce characteristic gamma rays within the interrogated object. Here we show that the measured gamma spectra for commonly found <b>ammunition</b> charged <b>with</b> TNT <b>explosives</b> are dominated by C, O and Fe peaks enabling the underwater determination of explosives inside an ammunition shell...|$|R
40|$|Results of {{numerical}} {{calculations of}} the impact of steel cylinders and spheres on the plastic bonded high explosive PBX 9501 are described. The calculations were carried out by a reactive, multicomponent, two dimensional, Eulerian hydrodynamic computer code, 2 DE. The 2 DE computer code is a finite difference code that uses the donor acceptor cell method to compute mixed cell fluxes. The parameters in the Forest Fire burn model are developed from experiments where the induced shock approximates a plane wave and are applied, in this case, to a situation where the induced shock is a divergent wave with curvature that depends on {{the size and shape of}} the projectile. The calculated results are compared with results from experiments involving instrumented mock and live high <b>explosives,</b> <b>with</b> <b>projectiles</b> of varying size, shapes, and velocities...|$|R

40|$|Detonation wave {{profiles}} {{have been}} measured in several HMX based plastic bonded explosives including PBX 9404, PBX 9501, and EDC- 37, {{as well as}} two HMX powders (coarse and fine) pressed to 65 % of crystal density. The powders had 120 and 10 {micro}m average grain sizes, respectively. Planar detonations were produced by impacting the <b>explosive</b> <b>with</b> <b>projectiles</b> launched in a 72 -mm bore gas gun. Impactors, impact velocity, and explosive thickness were chosen so that the run distance to detonation was always less than half the explosive thickness. For the high density plastic bonded explosives, particle velocity wave profiles were measured at an explosive/window interface using two VISAR interferometers. PMMA windows with vapor deposited aluminum mirrors were used for all experiments. Wave profiles for the powdered explosives were measured using magnetic particle velocity gauges. Estimates of the reaction zone parameters were obtained from the profiles using Hugoniots of the explosive and window...|$|R

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{measured}} detonation wave profiles in PBX 9501 (95 wt% HMX and 5 wt% binders) using VISAR. Planar detonations were produced by impacting the <b>explosive</b> <b>with</b> <b>projectiles</b> launched in a 72 mm bore gas gun. Particle velocity wave profiles were {{measured at the}} explosive/window interface using two VISARs with different fringe constants. Windows with very thin vapor deposited aluminum mirrors were used for all experiments. PMMA windows provided an undermatch, and LiF (Lithium Fluoride) windows provided an overmatch to the explosive, reacted and unreacted. While the present experiments do not have adequate time resolution to adequately resolve the ZND spike condition, they do constrain it to lie between 38. 7 and 53. 4 Gpa or 2. 4 and 3. 3 km/s. Accurate knowledge of the CJ state places the reaction zone length at 35 {+-} 12 ns ({approx} 0. 3 mm). The present experiments do not show any effect of the window on the reaction zone; both window materials result in the same reaction zone length...|$|R

50|$|Most fighter {{aircraft}} {{were too}} slow to catch a V-1 unless they had a height advantage. Even when intercepted, the V-1 was difficult to bring down.

50|$|Armour {{with two}} or more plates spaced a {{distance}} apart is called spaced armour.
