In cases of genocide or other serious human-rights violations, an AU-mission could be launched even against {{the wishes of the}} government of the country concerned, {{as long as it is}} approved by the AU General Assembly. The establishment of the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) which includes the <b>African</b> <b>Standby</b> <b>Force</b> (ASF) is planned earliest for 2015.|$|E
25|$|The {{founding}} treaty of the AU {{also called for}} the establishment of the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA), including the <b>African</b> <b>Standby</b> <b>Force</b> (ASF), which is to be deployed in emergencies. That means, in cases of genocide or other serious human-rights violations, an ASF mission can be launched even against the wishes of the government of the country concerned, {{as long as it is}} approved by the AU General Assembly. In the past AU peacekeeping missions, the concept was not yet applied, forces had to be mobilised from member states. The AU is planning on putting the concept into practise by 2015 the earliest.|$|E
25|$|Ethiopia is {{the place}} of origin of the coffee bean, which was first {{cultivated}} at Kefa, one of the 14 provinces in the old Ethiopian administration. It is a land of natural contrasts, with its vast fertile west, jungles, and numerous rivers, and the world's hottest settlement of Dallol in its north. The Ethiopian Highlands are the largest continuous mountain ranges in Africa, and the Sof Omar Caves contains the largest cave on the continent. Ethiopia also has the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Africa. Additionally, the country {{is one of the}} founding members of the UN, the Group of 24 (G-24), the Non-Aligned Movement, G-77 and the Organisation of African Unity. Its capital city Addis Ababa serves as the headquarters of the African Union, the Pan African Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the <b>African</b> <b>Standby</b> <b>Force,</b> and many of the global NGOs focused on Africa. In the 1970s and 1980s, Ethiopia experienced civil conflicts and communist purges, which hindered its economy. The country has since recovered and now has the largest economy (by GDP) in East and Central Africa. According to Global Fire Power, Ethiopia also has the 41st most powerful military in the world, and the third most powerful in Africa.|$|E
50|$|Based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, EARO {{promoted}} {{bilateral dialogue}} through continuous {{engagement with the}} African Union (AU), the Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD), the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), Ethiopian International Institute for Peace and Development, the European Union, African Military Attachés Association, EASBRIG, <b>African</b> <b>Standby</b> <b>Forces,</b> and the U.S. Mission to the AU. EARO also maintained and expanded ACSS alumni networks and community chapters. Of these, the International Alumni Chapter {{played a critical role}} in advancing the policy dialogue on China’s role in Africa, the referendum in Southern Sudan, and ongoing instability in Somalia and Eritrea. The East Africa office worked with the Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa to support forums at Camp Lemonnier on issues of regional importance.|$|R

More recently he was involved in the preparation of the ACIRC (African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises) Force within the SANDF as well as at African Union level as the Deputy Exercise Director of Exercise Utulivu Africa 2014.|$|R
40|$|Ethiopia, {{being one}} of the force-contributing {{countries}} to the East <b>African</b> <b>Standby</b> Brigade (EASBRIG) and given its, resources, strategic location, and its military's long history, will have a significant role to play in creating a stable environment in the sub-region. This thesis analyzes the Organization of African Union/African Union (OAU/AU) efforts after the Cold War to restore security and ensure stability in the region and outlines the process of creating <b>African</b> <b>Standby</b> <b>Forces</b> (ASF) as sub-regional arrangements to bring stability and peace by preventing crises or responding to crises whenever they arise in the region. To fulfill such missions East African states have agreed to form the EASBRIG with each state contributing forces. This thesis also analyzes Ethiopia's past and current participation in peace operations (from 1951 in Korea to ongoing missions in Liberia and Burundi) and argues that though Ethiopia's participation in peace operations is commendable, many things could yet be improved and corrective measures need to be taken to better prepare for mission execution in regional and sub-regional crisis response efforts. There is work yet to be done on peacekeeping and peace enforcement in particular. How to better organize Ethiopia's Peace Force and increase their efficiency and effectiveness for future peace operations is a main goal of this thesis...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} South Africa’s {{engagement with the}} rest of the African continent in the realm of peace and security since 1994. It notes that despite expectations from the international community as well as its own policy documents that South Africa would promote human rights on the continent, this has not occurred in a substantial manner. Pretoria has been naı¨ve in its mediation attempts, or worse. Pretoria’s ambiguous position in relation to human rights is not only a product of domestic variables but also its own lack of capacity, especially on the military front. These domestic constraints are reinforced at a regional level where structures like the <b>African</b> <b>Standby</b> <b>Forces</b> are little more than ‘paper tigers’. This serves to reinforce the status quo, ultimately undermining human security and escalating prospects for future conflict. At the same time the article does point to some positive developments arising from the Zuma administration in its engagement on the African continent in its efforts to secure human security for Africa’s citizens.

It is concluded that <b>standby</b> <b>forces</b> provided by Member States to the UN, such as the multinational Stand-by Forces High Readiness Brigade for UN Operations (SHIRBRIG) and the more recent European Union (EU) Rapid Reaction Force (RRF), appear presently to be economically the most efficient means of providing UN peacekeeping. <b>Standby</b> <b>forces,</b> acknowledged by the UN as a feasible alternative to a UN standing army or police force, are economically the most efficient basically because they utilize more fully the existing military resources of Member States, rather than require major additional new resources for peacekeeping.
