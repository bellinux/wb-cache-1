5|$|However, {{this theory}} allowed a {{compound}} symmetry CP to be conserved. CP combines parity P (switching left to right) with charge conjugation C (switching particles with antiparticles). Physicists were again surprised when in 1964, James Cronin and Val Fitch provided clear evidence in kaon decays that CP symmetry could be broken too, winning them the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1973, Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa showed that CP violation in the weak interaction required {{more than two}} generations of particles, effectively predicting {{the existence of a}} then unknown third generation. This discovery earned them half of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics. Unlike parity violation, CP violation occurs in {{only a small number of}} instances, but remains widely held as <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> difference between the amount of matter and antimatter in the universe; it thus forms one of Andrei Sakharov's three conditions for baryogenesis.|$|E

After invading in 711, large areas of the Iberian Peninsula were ruled by Muslims until 1250, when they were restricted to Granada, which fell in 1492. However, the Reconquista did not result in the total expulsion of Muslims from Spain, since they, along with Jews, were tolerated by the ruling Christian elite. Large cities, especially Seville, Valladolid and Barcelona, had significant Jewish populations centered in Juderia, but in the coming years the Muslims were increasingly subjugated by alienation and torture.|$|E

25|$|With the {{development}} of private vehicular transportation in the following decades, the center pattern began to change. Facilities servicing the automobile, such as gas stations, began to spring up on undeveloped land outside the city center, followed by shopping strips with ample parking space for cars. Downtown areas became increasingly more congested with traffic, and as <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> problem, large, decentralized shopping centers were developed. This decline of Main Street was not an overnight event, yet happened gradually, {{over a period of}} fifty years. The first commercial strips {{on the outskirts of the}} town arrived in the late 1920s, however the greatest blow came after World War II, with the sprawling shopping centers of the 1950s.|$|E

If successful, the suit will require ADNR to write a new area plan, a many months-long process involving much public input and review of draft versions, although ultimately, approval of an area plan is decided by the Commissioner of Natural Resources, an appointee of the Governor.
