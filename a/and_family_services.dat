5|$|A {{decade after}} the fact, during {{the second round of}} child abuse allegations, Jackson's lawyers would file a memo stating that the 1994 {{settlement}} was made without his consent. A later disclosure by the FBI of investigation documents compiled over nearly 20 years led Jackson's attorney to suggest that no evidence of molestation or sexual impropriety from Jackson toward minors existed. According to reports, the Department of Children <b>and</b> <b>Family</b> <b>Services</b> (Los Angeles County) investigated Jackson beginning in 1993 with the Chandler allegation and again in 2003. Reports show the LAPD and DCFS did not find credible evidence of abuse or sexual misconduct.|$|E

25|$|DSPD often {{coordinates}} and collaborates {{with other}} state agencies {{to provide care}} for recipients of ID/RC HCBS waiver serves. Perhaps the strongest inter-agency partnership exists between the Division and the Division of Child <b>and</b> <b>Family</b> <b>Services.</b> These two state agencies often work together on crossover issues regarding their two respective populations. The most common crossover issue involves children who have experienced traumatic abuse or neglect and demonstrate extreme behavioral issues. Unfortunately, victims of acute abuse and neglect also experience significant developmental delays and thus qualify for services. In cases where these children have no other family or guardians, DSPD steps in to provide long-term care. Often, the child remains in the custody and guardianship of Child <b>and</b> <b>Family</b> <b>Services.</b> Division and Child <b>and</b> <b>Family</b> <b>Services</b> staff work closely together in these cases to ensure that services are administered appropriately and {{that the child is}} safe and healthy.|$|E
