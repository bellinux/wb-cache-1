5|$|As with {{previous}} Sonic games, Sonic 3 uses rings, {{scattered throughout the}} levels, as a health system; when the player is attacked without rings, is crushed, falls off-screen, drowns, or exceeds the act's ten-minute limit, they lose a life {{and return to the}} most recently passed checkpoint. Dying with zero lives gives the player a game over. The levels also include power-ups in television monitors that, when hit, grant the character an extra life, temporary invincibility to most hazards, a number of rings, a shield that <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> breathe underwater, a shield that <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> withstand fire from enemy projectiles, or a shield that attracts nearby rings.|$|E

5|$|A {{wavefront}} splitting interferometer divides a light wavefront {{emerging from}} a point or a narrow slit (i.e. spatially coherent light) and, after allowing the {{two parts of the}} wavefront to travel through different paths, <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> recombine. Fig.5 illustrates Young's interference experiment and Lloyd's mirror. Other examples of wavefront splitting interferometer include the Fresnel biprism, the Billet Bi-Lens, and the Rayleigh interferometer.|$|E

5|$|Balaenids are {{the right}} whales. These animals have very large heads, which can make {{up as much as}} 40% of their body mass, and much of the head is the mouth. This <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> take in large amounts of water into their mouths, letting them feed more effectively.|$|E
5|$|Horses have an {{advanced}} sense of taste, which <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> sort through fodder and choose {{what they would}} most like to eat, and their prehensile lips can easily sort even small grains. Horses generally will not eat poisonous plants, however, there are exceptions; horses will occasionally eat toxic amounts of poisonous plants even when there is adequate healthy food.|$|E
5|$|On 4 November 2009 Communications Minister Stephen Conroy {{approved}} a Digital TV only licence for West TV in Perth, which <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> broadcast as a digital-only community television station {{as a replacement}} for the now defunct Access 31.|$|E
50|$|The station used a {{broadcast}} system that <b>allowed</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> send images live over the cellular phone network, <b>allowing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> go to places that traditional television network news journalists {{could not go}} with their satellite trucks. As well their images went out live, rather that delayed, and they offered an alternative perspective on the events.|$|R

5|$|Their {{skill in}} {{foraging}} for food <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> survive in steep mountain {{areas where they}} both graze and eat plants that many other cattle avoid. They can dig through the snow with their horns to find buried plants.|$|E
5|$|A small, fast-swimming predator, the blacknose shark feeds {{primarily}} on small, bony fishes, including pinfish, croakers, porgies, anchovies, spiny boxfish, and porcupinefish, {{as well as}} on octopus and other cephalopods. When competing for bait, their speed <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> snatch food from larger sharks such as the Caribbean reef shark (C. perezi). This species may form large schools that are sometimes associated with anchovies and mullet. Blacknose sharks demonstrate a high degree of philopatry: both juveniles and adults have been documented returning to the same local area year after year.|$|E
5|$|After Raju and {{his team}} {{retrieve}} the gold, they are detained by local police. Raju identifies himself as a RAW agent {{and his team}} as intelligence officers from various agencies of India. He discloses his real name as Rajeev Sathyamoorthy.

5|$|Any {{extended}} ocean voyage without {{fresh water}} or food would prove {{difficult for a}} large, warm-blooded (homeothermic) mammal, but today many small, nocturnal species of lemur exhibit heterothermy, which <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> lower their metabolism and become dormant while living off fat reserves. Such a trait in a small, nocturnal lemur ancestor would have facilitated the ocean voyage and could have been passed on to its descendants. However, this trait has not been observed in the closely related lorisoids studied to date, and could have evolved on Madagascar {{in response to the}} island's harsh environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|As Mulder and Scully investigate, they {{discover}} a Malaysian orderly is illicitly giving the patients an herbal drug made of mushrooms he {{cultures in the}} building's basement. The drug cures their Alzheimer's, but also <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> see the spirits {{of people who have}} died in the nursing home and channel them into existence.

5|$|Compared {{to other}} {{shooters}} where melee {{is usually a}} last resort, F.E.A.R.'s melee is a viable instant-kill alternative for taking down enemies. The stocks of all firearms {{can be used in}} close combat. Lighter weapons, while being less powerful, allow the player to move around more quickly, increasing their chances of melee. Movement speed is maximized if a player holsters their weapon, which also <b>allows</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> engage in hand-to-hand attacks with maneuvers including punches, kicks, and slides.|$|E
5|$|Experiments into behavior, to {{understand}} how organisms detect and {{interact with each other}} and their environment, in which fruit flies, worms, mice, and rats are all widely used.
