5|$|The {{first song}} {{came on and}} I just stood up and I kind of walked {{into the other room}} as if I was in a tractor beam and stood there in front of the stereo. It was just as {{powerful}} as the electric stuff, and it was songs I'd grown up singing. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> I'd found my music.|$|E
5|$|Corman later said, I’m {{weary of}} {{prepackaged}} formulas, {{and when you}} try out a new idea, you necessarily think about shooting a hackneyed scene {{in a funny way}} without resorting to parody. This wasn’t a parody, it was “Good God, how can I find a different sort of gunslinger?” Right away, I thought of a woman gunslinger, and the idea for the script came to me <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden.</b> It was the sheriff’s wife. He’s killed and she takes over for her husband. It was logical when it wasn’t, but that was enough for a six-or seven-day western.|$|E

Players have to get shares back by earning stage points during live performances. Each show the number of fans and haters will change depending on the show. Players can choose costumes for the idols and change the camera angle. During live events, the CPUs can transform which also transforms their singing voice.|$|R
50|$|As {{described}} in a film magazine, determined that her son Francesco (Verdi) will have every advantage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> successful reign when he grows to manhood, Duchess Gismonda refuses <b>all</b> offers <b>of</b> marriage. <b>A</b> <b>sudden</b> danger to her son prompts her to offer her kingdom {{to the man who}} rescues the child. Almerio (Foote) braves the dangers of the lion's den to save the child, but because he is a slave the Duchess refuses to fulfill her vow. Gradually, she learns to love him, and after he assumes the guilt for a murder that she committed, Gismonda confesses to the crime and in the presence of her people makes Almerio her consort.|$|R
50|$|After the {{independence}} of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, {{the majority of the}} minority Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan migrated to India while the Muslim migrants from India settled down in Pakistan. Approximately 6 million Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while nearly <b>an</b> equal number <b>of</b> Muslims migrated to Pakistan from India. Hindu Sindhis were expected to stay in Sindh following {{the independence}}, as there were good relations between Hindu and Muslim Sindhis. At the time of independence there were 1,400,000 Hindu Sindhis, though most were concentrated in cities such as Hyderabad, Karachi, Shikarpur, and Sukkur. However, because of insecurity in Pakistan, and most <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> influx <b>of</b> Muslim refugees from Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Central Provinces, Hyderabad State, Rajputana (Rajasthan) and other parts of India, many Sindhi Hindus decided to leave Pakistan.|$|R
5|$|Satchel {{was easier}} to catch. He could throw it in a quart cup. But Rogan {{was all over the}} plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters thought it was a fastball heading for them and they would jump back from the plate and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. I have never seen a pitcher like him, and I have caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E
5|$|The men {{inside them}} paddled fast on the treadmills, and the ships glided {{forwards}} {{as though they}} were flying, yet no one was visible on board. The enemy thought that they were made of paper. Then <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> a thunderclap bomb was let off. It was made with paper (carton) and filled with lime and sulphur. (Launched from trebuchets) these thunderclap bombs came dropping down from the air, and upon meeting the water exploded with a noise like thunder, the sulphur bursting into flames. The carton case rebounded and broke, scattering the lime to form a smoky fog, which blinded the eyes of men and horses so that they could see nothing. Our ships then went forward to attack theirs, and their men and horses were all drowned, so that they were utterly defeated.|$|E
5|$|Bhimsen {{felt the}} need to finish off his rivals, but at the same time, felt a need to take {{precaution}} before going after immediate members of the royal household. For almost two years after returning to Kathmandu, Rana Bahadur had no official position in the government – he was neither a king, nor a regent, nor a minister – yet he felt no qualms in using the full state power. Not only did Rana Bahadur carry out the Baisathi Haran under Bhimsen's advice, he was also able to banish all non-vaccinated children, as well as their parents, from the town during a smallpox outbreak, in order to prevent King Girvan from catching that disease. Now, after almost two-year, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> Rana Bahadur was made mukhtiyar (chief authority) and Bhimsen tried to implement his schemes through Rana Bahadur. Bhimsen had also secretly learned of a plot to oust Rana Bahadur. Tribhuvan Khawas (Pradhan), a member of Sher Bahadur's faction, was imprisoned on the re-opened charges of conspiracy with the British that led to the Knox's mission, but for which pardon had already been doled out, and was ordered to be executed. Tribhuvan Khawas decided to reveal everyone that was involved in the dialogue with the British. Among those implicated was Sher Bahadur Shah.|$|E
2500|$|After the game, Allen {{was cited}} {{as one of}} the main reasons for Duke's {{comeback}} and win by commentators. Mike Krzyzewski agreed, saying, [...] "We were kind of dead in the water. We were nine points down and Grayson just put us on his back." [...] Commenting on his team's loss, Bo Ryan credited Duke's physical defense saying [...] "There was more body contact in this game than any game we played all year, and I just feel sorry for my guys that <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sudden</b> <b>a</b> game was like that, and I think they're struggling with that a little bit." [...] Ryan, however, also blamed the officials, citing the disparity in fouls called during the second half (Wisconsin's 13 to Duke's 6) and the controversial replay review near the end of the game.|$|R

25|$|The {{death of}} Lieutenant Colonel Arana is of {{critical}} importance {{in the history of}} Guatemala, because it was a pivotal event {{in the history of the}} Guatemalan revolution: his death not only paved the way for the election of Colonel Arbenz as president of the republic in 1950 but also caused an acute crisis in the government of Dr. Arévalo Bermejo, who <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> had against him an army that was more faithful to Arana than to him, and elite civilian groups that used the occasion to protest strongly against his government.|$|E

25|$|The {{tactics of}} the ninja martial art {{concerning}} sabotage and assassination was adapted to surprise tactics, i.e. attacking the enemy <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> during the night, either in the bushes or forestland, or endeavouring to stab {{him in the back}} in the low corridors and the small Japanese rooms, which thus requiered short and small weapons and sharp strikes. Ninja in espionage tried to avoid open battlefield with a numerically superior enemy forces, therefore their technique was adapted to stun the enemy and escape in case of failure.|$|E

25|$|This an {{opportunity}} to put people who would normally {{have no reason to}} interact with each other on one team... I want people whose power sets really build on each other so that there are specific limitations that can only become overcome by working together. Nobody's so overpowered that it gets boring and nobody's so underpowered that they have to be saved all the time. I wanted a balance visually and practically... What's also going to be interesting is working out the power structure of the group. You have several people on it who are used to being either their own bosses or in a leadership position, and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> they're together.|$|E

25|$|The way {{our studio}} {{operated}} was {{that anything that}} comes in – there’s no value judgments made about the music. We just record it. Still, {{one of the things}} that I guess was cool about being a staff engineer is that I wouldn’t have sought out a band like that. I wasn’t philosophically into anything that they were doing, but they were all good musicians – you would have to be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that aspect of it, and just the whole pushing the envelope thing. It sounds like it’s just gonna completely break apart going 700 miles through the sky and then <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> everything just comes right together again.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} methods Brecht uses are the inscriptions {{at the beginning of}} most of the scenes. Before the majority of the scenes, there is a short summary of that scene recited to the audience. By being already aware of what will happen, the audience can then better concentrate on {{what is going on in}} the scene. Often, Brecht will also have seemingly bizarre events occur, seemingly just to keep the audience unable to guess what will happen next. For example, Jimmy is going crazy at having nothing to do, when <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> a hurricane starts heading towards Mahagonny. The audience is forced to give up concentrating on how Jimmy feels and think about what the meaning of this sudden hurricane is.|$|E
25|$|Finally, all the {{characters}} of the parade began to walk inside the pool, around its center, mixing {{the past and the}} present in a single marching beat of the drums. The confluence of {{the past and the present}} is another main theme of the opening ceremony. The music began a crescendo with choruses, when <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> an olive tree was lifted from the center of the pool - symbolizing goddess Athena's preferred gift by the Greeks - land and food - over Poseidon's gift, the horse - a tool of warfare. At the music's climax, all {{the characters}} stopped and raised their arms as if worshipping the Tree, which was high above, surrounded also by the fragments of the deconstructed statues who resembled a mount.|$|E
