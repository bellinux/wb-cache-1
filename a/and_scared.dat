5|$|In Sanskrit literature, Sharabha is {{initially}} {{described as an}} animal that roared <b>and</b> <b>scared</b> other animals in the hills and forest areas. Similies compare warriors to Sharabha. In the later epic Mahabharata, this form of Sharabha was exaggerated as a lion-slaying monster with eight legs, eyes on the top; living in the forest and which ate raw flesh. It is also mentioned as residing on Mount Krauncha but not as a monster but as an ordinary beast along with lions and tigers on mount Gandhamadana. The epic also includes Sharabha {{in the list of}} edible animals - the mrigajatis- the animal group of antelope, deer, hare, bear, ruru deer, sambar, gayal, boar, and buffalo - which was offered as part of food at dinner to guests. Sharabha also appears as a name of a monkey-king in the epic Ramayana, also as a proper name of heroes, apes, demons (danavas) and serpent Nāgas and one of the names of god Vishnu as well as Buddha. In defining the ecological theme in Hindu medicine related to jungle and the aroma of meats, Sharabha has also been listed among the deer natives of Kashmir, Nepal, and Sikkim. However, the features explained are of an eight legged animal of the size of a camel with huge horns and conjectured as a large Himalayan goat.|$|E
5|$|Shrek {{established}} DreamWorks Animation {{as a prime}} competitor to Pixar in {{feature film}} computer animation, and grossed $484.4 million at the worldwide box office against its $60 million production budget. It was acclaimed as an animated film worthy of adult interest, with many adult-oriented jokes and themes but a simple enough plot and humor to appeal to children. Shrek won the first ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, and was also nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay. It was also nominated for six British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards, including the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Eddie Murphy for his voice performance as Donkey, and won the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. The film's success prompted DreamWorks to create three sequels—Shrek 2 (2004), Shrek the Third (2007), and Shrek Forever After (2010), two holiday specials—Shrek the Halls (2007) <b>and</b> <b>Scared</b> Shrekless (2010), and a spin-off film—Puss in Boots (2011). A fifth film, planned {{as the last of}} the series, was cancelled in 2009, with the announcement that the fourth film would conclude the series. However, the fifth film was revived in 2016, with a planned release for 2019/2020. The film's success also inspired other merchandise, such as video games, a stage musical, and a comic book adaptation by Dark Horse Comics. The film's main title character was awarded his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in May 2010.|$|E

25|$|In 1867, Bullock {{became a}} {{resident}} of Helena, Montana, where he unsuccessfully ran for the Territorial Legislature. He was subsequently elected as a Republican to the Territorial Senate, serving in 1871 and 1872 and helped create Yellowstone National Park. In 1873, he was elected sheriff of Lewis and Clark County, Montana. During his tenure as sheriff, he killed his first man, Clell Watson. Watson had stolen a horse and engaged in a gunfight with Bullock, in which Bullock was slightly wounded in the shoulder. Watson was then taken into custody. Watson was prepared to be hanged, but a mob appeared <b>and</b> <b>scared</b> off the executioner. Bullock climbed the scaffold and pulled the lever, sending Watson to his death. Bullock then held off the mob with a shotgun. This incident was recreated on HBO's Deadwood, except that Watson was hanged on the step of the sheriff's office.|$|E
25|$|In the Netherlands, Philip II had bequeathed his {{remaining}} territories in the Low Countries {{to his daughter}} Isabella of Spain and her husband, Archduke Albert, {{under the condition that}} if she died without heirs, the province would return to the Spanish Crown. Given that Isabella was notoriously childless, it was clear that this was only intended to be a temporary measure, and that Philip II had envisaged an early revision to Philip III. As a result, Philip's foreign policy in the Netherlands would be exercised through the strong-willed Archdukes, but in the knowledge that ultimately the Spanish Netherlands would return to him as king. Meanwhile, the Italian-born Ambrosio Spinola was to perform a crucial role as a Spanish general in the Army of Flanders. Having demonstrated his military prowess at the siege of Ostend in 1603, Spinola rapidly started to propose and implement policies almost independently of the central councils in Madrid, somehow managing to achieve military victories even without central funding from Spain. De Lerma was uncertain of how to deal with Spinola; on the one hand, de Lerma desperately needed a successful military commander in the Netherlands – on the other, de Lerma was contemptuous of Spinola's relatively low origins <b>and</b> <b>scared</b> of his potential to destabilise de Lerma at court. In the years leading to the outbreak of war in 1618, Spinola was working to produce a plan to finally defeat the Dutch, involving an intervention in the Rhineland followed by fresh hostilities aiming to cut the Low Countries in two: portrayed at the time as the 'spider in the web' of Catholic politics in the region, Spinola was operating without significant consultation with Philip in Madrid.|$|E

However, he also cites Contamination (1980) <b>and</b> <b>Scared</b> to Death (1981) as less effective imitations of Scott. Besides Alien, Edward Jones of the newspaper The Free Lance–Star discerns elements of the novel Dracula (1897), the TV series The Bionic Woman (1976–78), and the films Night of the Living Dead (1968) and The Thing (1982) in the plot of Inseminoid.|$|E

The outbreak cost local restaurants {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars and health officials shut down the salad bars of the affected establishments. Some residents feared further attacks and stayed at home. One resident said: [...] "People were so horrified <b>and</b> <b>scared.</b> People wouldn't go out, they wouldn't go out alone.

Although Shrek 2 {{received}} similar acclaim from critics, {{the final two}} movies received some mixed reviews. They were, however, still box office hits. There were also two holiday specials entitled Shrek the Halls <b>and</b> <b>Scared</b> Shrekless, a spin-off Puss in Boots (a prequel to the Shrek series, exploring the origins of Puss in Boots, a character in the Shrek sequels), and several shorts. A fifth feature film was also planned for release, but was later cancelled in 2009, after {{it was decided that}} Shrek Forever After (originally titled Shrek Goes Fourth) was to be the last film in the series. However, in July 2016, the fifth film was announced and is set for release in 2019.|$|E
500|$|Following Turtle’s {{abortive}} {{attack in}} New York Harbor, Bushnell continued {{his work in}} underwater explosives. In 1777, he devised mines to be towed for an attack on HMS Cerberus and to be floated down the Delaware River {{in an attempt to}} interrupt the British fleet off Philadelphia. Both attempts failed, and the latter occupied a brief, if farcical, place in the literature of the war. Francis Hopkinson’s poem “Battle of the Kegs,” captured the surprising, if futile, venture: “The soldier flew, the sailor too, <b>and,</b> <b>scared</b> almost to death, sir, wore out their shoes to spread the news, and ran till out of breath, sir.” [...] After the war, Bushnell drifted into obscurity. He died largely unknown in Georgia in the mid-1820s. [...] After the war, inventors such as Robert Fulton were influenced by Bushnell’s designs in the development of underwater explosives.|$|E
500|$|The season {{introduced}} the character X, played by Steven Williams, who replaced Deep Throat as Mulder's informant, following Deep Throat's assassination in the first-season finale, [...] "The Erlenmeyer Flask". X was {{originally intended to}} be a woman with Natalija Nogulich already cast in the role, but was replaced by Williams as the writers did not believe she had the [...] "right chemistry" [...] with her co-stars. X was written to be different than Deep Throat; Deep Throat had been selfless, while X was intended to be selfish <b>and</b> <b>scared.</b> Nicholas Lea, who had previously appeared in a small part in the season one's [...] "Gender Bender", was cast as Alex Krycek. Krycek was originally intended as a temporary replacement for Scully when she was abducted, but grew into a character who would last seven seasons on the show.|$|E

500|$|Director Ole Christian Madsen {{had read}} the book They Saw It Happen about the Nazi Resistance when he was 12. He was {{especially}} attracted by {{the story of the}} pair because of their moral ambiguity. Madsen stated, [...] "They both fascinated <b>and</b> <b>scared</b> me, and I sensed there was something dark and untold in their story." [...] He [...] "wanted to make a film that would revive and reassess their reputation". Years later, he met writer Lars K. Andersen, who had also read the book during his childhood, and this led them to envision a film. The project started in 1999; the idea for the film did not attract sponsors because it was viewed as [...] "past history" [...] or because it portrayed the resistance [...] "outrageously". This was precisely one of Madsen's objectives: to talk about their story because Danish wartime archives listed many fatalities simply as casualties of war instead of counting them as murders, thus [...] "suppress" [...] their real story. He wanted to bring attention to a part of Danish history [...] "the nation has since neglected to talk about", resulting in a [...] "collective misrepresentation".|$|E
500|$|According to Chahi, he was {{inspired}} by his 1999 trip to Mount Yasur's crater in Vanuatu. The scenery, {{and the power of}} the volcano, which was extremely active at the time, fascinated <b>and</b> <b>scared</b> him. Chahi, still intending to make another video game [...] "before [...] died", hoped that his next project could convey the: [...] "ambivalence of Nature, beautiful and potentially violent at the same time". Becoming more and more interested in the world's natural forces, Chahi went on to visit different volcanoes, including Dolomieu crater on Reunion Island, and a volcano in the Indian Ocean. Once the development was underway, Montpellier even recorded audio from a real volcano for inclusion in the game. Nature and cycle were some of the most important key elements of the game. The team intended to create different cycles and loops that would result in different kinds of interaction between the environments. For example, the tide cycle and eruption cycle changes dynamically, and it impacts the growth of plants and the lives of the villagers. According to Chahi, the cycle allows players to anticipate what will happen next.|$|E
