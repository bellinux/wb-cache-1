5|$|Municipalities in Rhode Island can {{incorporate}} as a town or city {{by a special}} act of the state legislature {{and there is no}} minimum population requirement. Eight municipalities were reincorporated as cities operating under a charter, while the other thirtyone remain as towns which perform similar services. Since Rhode Island has no county level of government, cities and towns provide services commonly performed by county governments in other states. Rhode Island's cities and towns may adopt one of four different forms of government: councilmanager, mayorcouncil, town counciltown meeting, or administratorcouncil. The primary difference between these forms of government is how the chief executive is selected. The Councilmanager system involves an elected council who exercise overall control of the local government and <b>a</b> <b>chief</b> <b>executive</b> termed city or town manager who is generally appointed by and responsible to the council for the administration of local policies. Councilmanager systems may elect a mayor but they have no formal administrative functions with the potential exception of a degree of veto power. Mayorcouncil systems have a similarly elected council however the mayor is elected and yields administrative power. In the town counciltown meeting system, there is no fulltime chief executive. There are no towns or cities in Rhode Island that use the administratorcouncil form of government.|$|E
