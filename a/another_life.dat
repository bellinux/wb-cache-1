5|$|Morris {{was given}} <b>another</b> <b>life</b> on 136, when Laker dropped him at square leg from the bowling of Compton. Bradman was given <b>another</b> <b>life</b> at 108; he {{advanced}} two metres down the pitch towards Laker and missed, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity. Australia reached tea at 1/292 with Morris on 150. The pair had added 171 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed by Yardley for 182, after hitting a tired-looking shot to mid-off, having partnered Bradman for {{a stand of}} 301 in 217 minutes. He struck 33 fours in 290 minutes of batting. Australia still needed 46 for victory, {{and went on to}} win by seven wickets with 15 minutes to spare, setting a new world record for the highest successful Test run-chase.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{was given}} <b>another</b> <b>life</b> on 136 when Laker dropped him while fielding at square leg from Compton's bowling. Bradman was given <b>another</b> <b>life</b> at 108 when he {{advanced}} two metres down the pitch to Laker and missed, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity with the batsman {{far out of}} his ground. Australia reached tea at 292/1 with Morris on 150. The pair had added 171 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed by Yardley for 182, after hitting a tired-looking shot to mid-off, having partnered Bradman in a stand of 301 in 217 minutes. He struck 33 fours in a 290-minute innings. This brought Miller to the crease with 46 runs still required. Miller struck two boundaries and helped take the score to 396 before falling lbw to Cranston with eight runs still needed. Harvey came in and got off the mark with a boundary that brought up the winning runs. Australia had won by seven wickets, setting a new world record for the highest successful Test runchase, with Bradman unbeaten on 173 in only 255 minutes of batting with 29 fours.|$|E

5|$|Bradman {{was given}} <b>another</b> <b>life</b> at 108 when he {{advanced}} two metres down the pitch to Jim Laker and missed, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity. Australia reached tea at 1/292 having added 171 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed for 182, having partnered Bradman in {{a stand of}} 301 in 217 minutes. This brought Miller to the crease with 46 runs still required. He struck two boundaries and helped take the score to 396 before falling with eight runs still needed.

5|$|The sheriff {{finds the}} wolf in the woods, {{and when he}} whistles, the wolf goes to him. As he pets the wolf's head, he sees himself holding a knife, about to hurt the woman he only knows as Mary Margaret. Graham pays a visit to her classroom, telling her that he {{believes}} they know each other from <b>another</b> <b>life,</b> before Storybrooke. Mary Margaret assumes that the sheriff has been talking to Henry, and while {{this is not the}} case, this gives Graham the idea to consult Henry about his book. Meanwhile, at the sheriff's office, Regina shows up and warns Emma to stay away from Graham, apparently jealous of his connection with Emma.|$|E
5|$|Upon resumption, Morris {{severely}} attacked Compton, who {{had been}} bowling {{in an attempt to}} exploit the spin, aided by a series of full tosses and long hops that were easily dispatched for runs. This prompted Yardley to take the new ball and replace Compton with pacemen. Australia reached 202, halfway to the required total, with 165 minutes left. When Bradman suffered a fibrositis attack, Morris had to shield him from the strike until it subsided. Morris passed his century, and was then given <b>another</b> <b>life</b> on 126 when Laker dropped him while fielding at square leg. Bradman was given <b>another</b> <b>life</b> at 108 when Evans missed a stumping opportunity. Australia reached tea at 288/1 with Morris on 150. The pair had added 167 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed by Yardley for 182, having partnered Bradman in a stand of 301 in 217 minutes. He struck 33 fours in 290 minutes of batting. This brought Miller to the crease with 46 runs still required. He struck two boundaries and helped take the score to 396 before falling to Cranston with eight runs still needed. Harvey came in and got off the mark with a boundary that brought up the winning runs. Australia had won by seven wickets, setting a new world record for the highest successful Test run-chase, with Bradman unbeaten on 173 in only 255 minutes with 29 fours. The attendance of 158,000 was the highest for any cricket match on English soil and the takings were 34,000 pounds. The attendance remains a record for a Test in England.|$|E

60|$|A passer-by on {{the other}} side of the street coughed {{slightly}} in the night air, and a thought flashed through Lemuel, from which he cowered, as if he had found himself lifting his hand against <b>another's</b> <b>life.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "blood money" [...] is {{a double}} entendre: it means money {{obtained}} {{at the cost of}} <b>another's</b> <b>life</b> as well as money paid to the family of a person who has been killed, usually by the killer or the killer's clan.|$|R
5|$|When in 2002 <b>another</b> <b>life</b> {{sentence}} prisoner {{challenged the}} Home Secretary's power to set minimum terms, Hindley {{and hundreds of}} others, whose tariffs had been increased by politicians, looked likely {{to be released from}} prison. Hindley's release seemed imminent and plans were made by supporters for her to be given a new identity. Home Secretary David Blunkett ordered Greater Manchester Police to find new charges against her, to prevent her release from prison. The investigation was headed by Superintendent Tony Brett, and initially looked at charging Hindley with the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, but the advice given by government lawyers was that because of the DPP's decision taken 15 years earlier, a new trial would probably be considered an abuse of process.|$|E
5|$|However, {{even where}} {{recognisable}} facts are present, {{their use in}} the History cannot be taken at face value. In the Life of Alexander Severus, the History makes the claim at 24.4 that Alexander had considered banning male prostitution but had decided against making it illegal, although the author added that the emperor Philip did later ban the practice. Although the claim about Alexander is false, the note about Philip is true — {{the source of this}} is Aurelius Victor (28.6–7, and who in turn sourced it from the Kaisergeschichte), and the History even copies Victor's style of moralising asides, which were not in the Kaisergeschichte. Normally, this anecdote would have been included in a Life of Philip, but its absence saw the author include it in <b>another</b> <b>life.</b> This is taken as evidence that the mid-work lacuna is deliberate, as the author was apparently reluctant to abandon any useful material that could be gleaned from the Kaisergeschichte.|$|E
5|$|In Granny's Cafe, Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) throws darts at {{a picture}} of a deer very accurately. Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) arrives but leaves {{immediately}} because she has not forgiven him for hiding his relationship with Regina (Lana Parrilla). Emma attempts to avoid conversation, but Graham is insistent on explaining to her he feels nothing for Regina. He kisses Emma and suddenly sees a vision of a wolf, only to have Emma push him away. Frustrated by Emma's lack of understanding, Graham later sleeps with Regina. During the night, he awakens abruptly from a dream of a deer and a wolf. When Graham tells Regina that the dream felt like a memory, Regina tries to convince him to stay, but Graham leaves. As Graham attempts to get to his car, the wolf from his visions appears next to him, startling him before it leaves. As he tries to find the wolf in the woods, he runs into Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle). Graham tells him about the wolf, and Mr. Gold suggests to him that dreams are memories from <b>another</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
50|$|The morality, ethics, and {{legality}} of the taking of <b>another's</b> <b>life</b> to increase one's own chances of survival have been discussed in thought experiments from the Plank of Carneades to The Case of the Speluncean Explorers, {{but there have been}} few legal cases where the question has been tested.|$|R

25|$|In 1998, Riina {{was given}} <b>another</b> <b>life</b> {{sentence}} for the high-profile murder of Salvo Lima, {{a politician who}} had long since been suspected of being in league with the Mafia and who had been shot dead in 1992 after {{he had failed to}} prevent the convictions of Mafiosi in the Maxi Trial of the mid-1980s.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Eadie and Scott, Sinclair also {{pleaded guilty to}} culpable homicide of his eight-year-old neighbour Catherine Reehill in Glasgow in 1961, when he was sixteen, and given <b>another</b> <b>life</b> sentence in 2001 for the 1978 murder of 17-year-old Mary Gallacher on a footpath in Glasgow. He {{is thought to have}} also killed four other women between 1977 and 1978; all within a seven-month period of the murders of Eadie and Scott.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, Muslims believe body desecration in life {{or death}} to be forbidden, and thus many reject organ transplant.

25|$|Platoon was {{the first}} of three films Stone has made about the Vietnam War: the others were Born on the Fourth of July and Heaven & Earth, each dealing with {{different}} aspects of the war. Platoon is a semi-autobiographical film about Stone's experience in combat; Born on the Fourth of July is based on the autobiography of US Marine turned peace campaigner Ron Kovic; Heaven & Earth is based on the memoir When Heaven and Earth Changed Places, in which Le Ly Hayslip recalls her life as a Vietnamese village girl drastically affected by the war and who finds <b>another</b> <b>life</b> in the USA.|$|E
25|$|Rebirth, or saṃsāra, is {{the concept}} that all life forms go through a cycle of reincarnation, that {{is a series of}} births and rebirths. The rebirths and {{consequent}} life may be in different realm, condition or form. The karma theories suggest that the realm, condition and form depends on {{the quality and quantity of}} karma. In schools that believe in rebirth, every living being's soul transmigrates (recycles) after death, carrying the seeds of Karmic impulses from life just completed, into <b>another</b> <b>life</b> and lifetime of karmas. This cycle continues indefinitely, except for those who consciously break this cycle by reaching moksa. Those who break the cycle reach the realm of gods, those who don't continue in the cycle.|$|E

30|$|It is {{important}} to note that, even when serious risk factors or murderous triggers exist, there are normative barriers in the Ethiopian community against the taking of <b>another's</b> <b>life.</b> Hence, these triggers function not only to enact a decision to murder, but to enable the murderer to neutralize his guilt or shame, while 'settling his accounts' (Scott and Lyman, 1990; Edelstein, 2009).|$|R

25|$|In 2012, {{the spouse}} {{of one of}} the murdered {{researchers}} {{wrote a letter to the}} judge presiding over the case. In this letter, the writer indicated that the researcher's family had greatly suffered from its loss due to Bishop's actions, but that the family did not see a benefit from the loss of <b>another</b> <b>life.</b> In response to this letter, Bishop's lawyers offered to change her plea to guilty in exchange for the prosecution not seeking the death penalty. On receiving this offer, chief prosecutor Robert Broussard contacted and learned from the nine survivors that none of them wanted the death sentence for Bishop. On the basis of these opinions, Broussard decided not to seek the death penalty. Bishop changed her plea to guilty.|$|E
25|$|While {{that helped}} them {{become the most}} {{powerful}} clan in Sicily, the Corleonesi's tactics backfired to some degree when, in 1984, a convicted double-killer named Tommaso Buscetta became the first Sicilian Mafioso to become an informant (to repent; become a pentito), and cooperate with the authorities. Buscetta was from a losing family in the Mafia war and had lost several relatives and many friends to Riina's hitmen; becoming an informant was a way both to save himself and get his revenge on Riina. Buscetta provided {{a great deal of}} information to prosecutor Giovanni Falcone and he testified at the Maxi Trial in the mid-1980s that saw hundreds of Mafiosi imprisoned. Riina picked up <b>another</b> <b>life</b> sentence for murder at the Maxi Trial, but it was another in absentia sentence as he was still a fugitive.|$|E
25|$|The Saint {{starring}} Val Kilmer {{was made}} in 1997 but diverged far from the Charteris books, although it did revive Templar's use of aliases. Kilmer's Saint is unable to defeat a Russian gangster in hand-to-hand combat and is forced to flee; {{this would have been}} unthinkable in a Charteris tale. Whereas the original Saint resorted to aliases that had the initials S.T., Kilmer's character used Christian saints, regardless of initials. This Saint refrained from killing, and even the main villains live to stand trial, whereas Charteris's version had no qualms about taking <b>another</b> <b>life.</b> Kilmer's Saint is presented as a master of disguise, but Charteris's version hardly used the sophisticated ones shown in this film. The film mirrored aspects of Charteris's own life, notably his origins in the Far East, though not in an orphanage as the film portrayed. Sir Roger Moore features throughout in cameo as the BBC Newsreader heard in Simon Templar's Volvo.|$|E
50|$|The {{tombstone}} of Marcus Caelius, at Xanten, in Germany, is {{a particularly}} well-known and ornate example of a legionary tombstone. He is shown in a deep-set relief, flanked by busts of his freedmen, beneath a classical colonnade and pediment. He holds the vitis, the cane held by a centurion, and wears a crown of oak - a symbol that he had saved <b>another's</b> <b>life</b> at some point.|$|R
5000|$|How can a man be {{master of}} <b>another's</b> <b>life,</b> {{if he is}} not even master of his own?
