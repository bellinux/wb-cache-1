5|$|Investigations of the West Group have {{revealed}} <b>an</b> <b>occupation</b> {{beginning in the}} Late Classic and reaching its maximum extent in the Terminal Classic. The construction methods used in the West Group were inferior {{to those of the}} acropolis, consisting of finely cut limestone blocks bound with an earth-based mortar rather than the lime-based mortar used in the palace complex. The platforms of the West Group appear to have supported perishable superstructures and some of these buildings may have been dedicated to craft production.|$|E

5000|$|As the Bar chart shows, in 1881 {{the vast}} {{majority}} of males (44) in Ashleyhay were employed in Agriculture of some variety. The other four males eligible to work all had different <b>occupations.</b> One <b>a</b> Labourer, one involved in transport, one with <b>an</b> unspecified <b>occupation</b> and one with <b>an</b> unknown <b>occupation.</b> The majority of females (37) in Ashleyhay also had <b>an</b> unknown <b>occupation,</b> and 4 had <b>an</b> unspecified <b>occupation,</b> this doesn't necessarily mean they were unemployed but it is most likely the case especially with females. The only specified occupations that females had in 1881 were in Agriculture in which two females worked and in Domestic services in which six females worked. The key reason for the majority of people working in <b>an</b> agricultural <b>occupation</b> is Ashleyhay's location. It is a very rural parish where the main resource is the land {{that can be used for}} farming [...]|$|R
5|$|The Lithuanian {{government}} in Kaunas, which viewed {{the city as}} the historic capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, saw the Polish incursion as <b>an</b> <b>occupation.</b> The Lithuanian government demanded Vilnius back. Relations between the Polish and Lithuanian governments, unable to reach a compromise over Vilnius, continued to worsen, destroying the prospects for Piłsudski's plan of the Międzymorze federation and leading to open hostilities in the ensuing Polish–Lithuanian War. In 1920, the Soviets recaptured Vilnius, followed by the Poles' establishment of the short-lived Republic of Central Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} minor actions {{followed}} as the Australians continued their advance up the Milford Highway. After {{a month of}} fighting, the island was largely secured and following the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early August 1945, the Japanese sued for peace and hostilities came to an end. During the fighting in Borneo the 2/33rd had lost 25 dead and 57 wounded. In {{the immediate aftermath of}} the war, the Australians remained on Borneo as <b>an</b> <b>occupation</b> force, while the Army was slowly demobilised. During this time the battalion was steadily reduced as personnel were repatriated to Australia for discharge, or were transferred to other units for further service, including providing personnel to the 34th Brigade, which was raised for occupation duties in Japan.|$|E
5|$|After the Civil War {{and until}} his {{transfer}} back East in 1887, he served {{primarily on the}} western frontier. He engaged many Native American tribes, dealt with many types of renegades and explored vast areas of uncharted territory from Texas to Arizona. During the Spanish–American War, he commanded <b>an</b> <b>occupation</b> force {{and became the first}} military governor of Puerto Principe, Cuba. After 38 continuous years of service to his country, he retired from the Army on October 19, 1899, as a brigadier general. After his retirement, he became a speaker and a writer.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{interactions}} of secondary vocational training and training-related occupation on the wage of the first job obtained {{in the two years}} immediately after high school. Prior empirical tests of the importance of <b>a</b> training-related <b>occupation</b> in determining labor market outcomes are misspecified because they do not separate training-related effects from effects of the type of occupation entered. Since the concept of <b>a</b> training-related <b>occupation</b> is based on a match between the type of training and the type of occupation, it is possible that apparent effects of <b>a</b> training-related <b>occupation</b> are, in fact, only an effect of the occupation with which the training is matched. We use data from the younger cohort of the High School and Beyond sample to conduct an evaluation of the importance of <b>a</b> training-related <b>occupation.</b> Our findings agree with past research in that large positive coefficients are associated with work in <b>a</b> training-related <b>occupation</b> when the type of occupation is omitted from the model. However, when the type of occupation is included, nearly all the effects on wage are associated with occupation and not with training nor with <b>a</b> training-related <b>occupation.</b> Estimates from both OLS and switching regressions are consistent with these conclusions. ...|$|R
50|$|Handloom is <b>a</b> major <b>occupation</b> {{among the}} distaff {{population}} of the villages. Although largely <b>a</b> non-commercial <b>occupation,</b> it keeps many of the inhabitants occupied. Weaving is exquisite and intricate {{with the use of}} a variety of colours and textures of cotton and silk, especially Muga silk.|$|R
5|$|Although cottage industries, both in boyar and peasant households, {{were still}} {{the main source}} of clothing, food and construction, {{specialized}} production, such as weaving and pottery, started to develop {{by the middle of the}} 15thcentury. The first oil wells went into production in 1440, but their oil was also only for household use. In Moldavia, Gypsy slaves were first mentioned in 1428 when Alexander I awarded 31 Gypsy families to the Bistriţa Monastery. In time Gypsies became specialized in several crafts: for example, throughout the Middle Ages the working of iron was <b>an</b> <b>occupation</b> reserved almost exclusively for them.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>occupation</b> of {{the pier}} was started by ten activists on the {{designated}} closure date. The campaign was boosted {{by the appearance of}} Chow Yun-fat early on the morning of 28 April to sign the petition, and to appeal pre-emptively to the police not to hurt protesters. Some activists, like Chu Hoi-dick, {{have been involved in the}} Star Ferry pier protest, and took turns to maintain a round-the-clock presence. Leung Chun-yiu spent three nights a week at the site, despite working a full-time job, vowing to block the demolition non-violently in any way he could.|$|E
5|$|Despite being neutral at {{the start}} of World War II, Belgium and its colonial {{possessions}} found themselves at war after the country was invaded by German forces on 10 May 1940. After 18 days of fighting in which Belgian forces were pushed back into a small pocket in the north-east of the country, the Belgian military surrendered to the Germans, beginning <b>an</b> <b>occupation</b> that would endure until 1944. The surrender of 28 May was ordered by King Leopold III without the consultation of his government and sparked a political crisis after the war. Despite the capitulation, many Belgians managed to escape to the United Kingdom where they formed a government and army-in-exile on the Allied side.|$|E

5|$|During {{his years}} of exile in Siberia, Piłsudski met many Sybiraks, {{including}} Bronisław Szwarce, who had almost become {{a leader of the}} January 1863 Uprising. He was allowed to work in <b>an</b> <b>occupation</b> of his own choosing, and earned his living tutoring local children in mathematics and foreign languages (he knew French, German and Lithuanian in addition to Russian and his native Polish; he would later learn English). Local officials decided that as a Polish noble he was not entitled to the 10-ruble pension received by most other exiles.|$|E
5|$|During the Ottoman wars in Europe, Klis Fortress was, for a century, an {{administrative}} centre or sanjak (Kilis Sancağı) of the Bosnia Eyalet. On April 7, 1596, Split noblemen Ivan Alberti and Nikola Cindro, along with Uskoci, Poljičani, and Kaštelani irregulars, organized <b>an</b> <b>occupation</b> of Klis. Assisted by dissident {{elements of the}} Turkish garrison, they succeeded. Bey Mustafa responded by bringing more than 10,000 soldiers under the fortress. General Ivan Lenković, leading 1,000 Uskoci, came in relief of the 1,500 Klis defenders. During the battle, Ivan Lenković and his men retreated after he was wounded in battle, and the fortress was lost to the Turks, on May 31. Nevertheless, this temporary relief resounded in Europe and among the local population.|$|E

5|$|Little {{evidence}} of <b>an</b> <b>occupation</b> on the tell exists following {{the destruction of}} the Mitannian city, however, a series of small villages existed in the lower town during the Assyrian periods. The remains of a Hellenistic settlement were discovered on a nearby satellite tell, to the northwestern edge of the main tell. However, excavations recovered no ceramics of the Parthian-Roman or Byzantine-Sasanian periods, although sherds dating to those periods are noted. In the middle of the first millennium AD, a fortified building was erected in the northeastern lower town. The building was dated by Antoine Poidebard to the Justinian era (sixth century AD), {{on the basis of its}} architecture. The last occupation period of the site was during the early Abbasid Caliphate's period, when a canal was built to provide the town with water from the nearby Jaghjagh River.|$|E
5|$|Living River Siam was {{launched}} on March 14, 1999, the International Rivers Day of Action, {{by a group}} of NGO workers and Thai academics. Its first action, on March 23, was to support <b>an</b> <b>occupation</b> of the Pak Mun Dam site by 5,000 villagers. The Pak Mun Dam, funded partially by the World Bank, was built in 1994 and slowly became the focus of national controversy. It received widespread complaints from Thai villagers and was the focus of the Assembly of the Poor's 99-day, 20,000-person protest in Bangkok in 1997. The dam generates 0.5 percent of Thailand's electric capacity; 40 percent of Thailand's total electric capacity goes unused on an everyday basis.|$|E

For his service in Iceland, he was awarded the Letter of Commendation with Commendation Ribbon. In February 1942 he was given command of the 2nd Battalion, 6th Marines. With the United States at war, 1st Provisional Marine Brigade moved to New York City, New York, in March, and was disbanded. Shoup moved with his battalion to Camp Elliott in San Diego.|$|E
