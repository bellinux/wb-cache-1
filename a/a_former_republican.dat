5|$|The 1960s {{were less}} {{successful}} for the club, with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga. The {{completion of the}} Camp Nou, finished in 1957, meant the club had little {{money to spend on}} new players. The 1960s saw the emergence of Josep Maria Fusté and Carles Rexach, and the club won the Copa del Generalísimo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966. Barcelona restored some pride by beating Real Madrid 1–0 in the 1968 Copa del Generalísimo final at the Santiago Bernabéu in front of Francisco Franco, with coach Salvador Artigas, <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>republican</b> pilot in the Civil War. With the end of Franco's dictatorship in 1974, the club changed its official name back to Futbol Club Barcelona and reverted the crest to its original design, including the original letters once again.|$|E

25|$|Pro-Union {{sentiment}} {{during and}} after the Civil War helped the party to expand in importance. Between 1858 and 1932 the Republicans won every Iowa gubernatorial election, with the exception of 1890, when Horace Boies, <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>Republican,</b> was elected because of his opposition to Prohibition. In 1932 electoral frustration with the Great Depression and Prohibition led to the re-emergence of the Democratic Party in Iowa. Historically the party has held the Governor's office – 30 of Iowa's 41 governors have been Republicans.|$|E
25|$|After {{the right-wing}} {{defeat in the}} 1997 {{legislative}} election, the UDF faced a major crisis. While the centrist components had merged into FD led by François Bayrou, the liberal-conservatives tried to overcome the chiraquiens/balladuriens fracture. The PR was joined by some politicians from the PPDF, such as Jean Pierre Raffarin (<b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>Republican)</b> and was renamed Liberal Democracy (DL). DL soon began to reassert its autonomy within the alliance and finally broke ranks with the UDF in 1998. The event which triggered the split was the election of UDF politicians {{at the head of}} four regional councils, who won with support from the National Front. DL refused to condemn the arrangement, whilst the centrists did.|$|E
25|$|Goldwater seriously {{considered}} retirement in 1980 {{before deciding to}} run for reelection. Peggy Goldwater reportedly hoped that her husband's Senate term, due to end in January 1981, would be his last. Goldwater decided to run, planning to make the term his last in the Senate. Goldwater faced a surprisingly tough battle for reelection. He was viewed by some as out of touch and vulnerable for several reasons; most importantly, because {{he had planned to}} retire in 1981, Goldwater had not visited many areas of Arizona outside of Phoenix and Tucson. He was also challenged by a formidable opponent, Bill Schulz, <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>Republican</b> turned Democrat and a wealthy real estate developer. Schulz was able to infuse massive amounts of money into the campaign from his own fortune.|$|E

500|$|After {{years of}} debate and {{numerous}} proposals, {{the site was}} occupied in 2003 by the Spire of Dublin, a slim needle-like structure rising almost three times {{the height of the}} [...] Pillar. In 2000 <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>republican</b> activist gave a radio interview in which he admitted planting the explosives in 1966, but after questioning him the police decided not to take action. Relics of the Pillar are found in Dublin museums and appear as decorative stonework elsewhere, and its memory is preserved in numerous works of Irish literature.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the leaders}} of the silver {{movement}} was Illinois Governor Altgeld; a native of Germany, he was constitutionally barred from the presidency by his foreign birth. Going into the convention, the two leading candidates for the nomination were former Congressman Bland, who had originated the Bland-Allison Act, and former Iowa Governor Horace Boies, with Bland considered the frontrunner. These were the only two candidates to put together organizations to try to secure delegate votes, though both efforts were cash-starved. [...] Both men had electoral problems: Bland at age 61 was seen by some as a man whose time had passed; Boies was <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>Republican</b> who had once decried bimetallism. There were a large number of potential candidates seen as having less support; these included Vice President Adlai Stevenson of Illinois, Senator Joseph C. Blackburn of Kentucky, Senator Teller, and Bryan.|$|E
500|$|As in the mayor's race, {{the contest}} for {{district}} attorney pitted a Democratic reformer, Richardson Dilworth, against {{a representative of}} the Republican machine, Michael A. Foley. Dilworth, like Clark, was <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>Republican</b> who had been advocating reform for several years. He had run for mayor unsuccessfully in 1947, with Clark as his campaign manager. In 1949, he was elected City Treasurer. Democratic Party leaders had intended Dilworth to be their candidate for mayor again in 1951, but when Clark announced his candidacy, Dilworth agreed to run for district attorney instead. Foley, a local attorney, had organization backing in the primary but had no success against the Democratic wave in the general election. Dilworth was unopposed in the primary. In November, Dilworth won by almost as large a margin as Clark, taking just shy of 58% of the vote. He told reporters that the victory had a [...] "sobering effect", adding: [...] "the bigger the victory, the bigger the responsibility".|$|E
