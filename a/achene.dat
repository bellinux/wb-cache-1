40|$|Garhadiolus papposus is {{a common}} ephemeral Asteraceae species that germinates in early spring in the Junggar Desert. It {{produces}} three types of <b>achenes</b> in one infructescence that differ in morphology anddispersal behavior. To better understand how this species is adapted to its desert habitat, we studied morphological and dispersal characteristics of its <b>achenes.</b> The three types of <b>achenes</b> differed significantly in the number, shape, color, mass, length and density of pappuses, and embryo size. Peripheral <b>achenes,</b> which were subtended by the inner involucral bracts (phyllaries), were smooth, weighed 118. 10 ± 1. 30 mg per 100 <b>achenes,</b> were columnar and arcuate, yellow or yellow whitish, 6. 67 ± 0. 10 mm in length, and had a scarcely-developed pappus. Central <b>achenes</b> with numerous conspicuous thin longitudinal ribs weighed 69. 00 ± 0. 60 mg per 100 <b>achenes,</b> were columnar and arcuate or straight, brown, elongated (9. 74 ± 0. 14 mmlength), and had a well developed pappus. Intermediate <b>achenes</b> represented a range of morphologies between the “pure” central and peripheral types. In a given head, the central <b>achenes</b> were more numerous than intermediate and peripheral ones (5. 77 ± 0. 13 vs 5. 39 ± 0. 14 vs 5. 24 ± 0. 05). In addition, central and intermediate <b>achenes</b> had thinner and anatomically different pericarps (half as much biomass) compared to peripheral <b>achenes</b> (69. 7 μm vs 82. 1 μm vs 156. 7 μm), and embryos in peripheral <b>achenes</b> were heavier than those in central and intermediate <b>achenes</b> (46. 70 ± 0. 50 mg vs 36. 80 ± 0. 30 mg vs 36. 90 ± 0. 30 mg per 100 embryos). The three morphs differed in dispersal potential. In the laboratory, dispersal distance was longer for central than for intermediate <b>achenes,</b> and longer for intermediate than peripheral <b>achenes.</b> In the field, central acheneswere dispersed relatively long distances by wind, whereas peripheral <b>achenes,</b> which are covered by lignified phyllaries, remained on the capitulum after maturation and were dispersed, close to the mother plants, only when the capitulum broke apart. Dispersal features of intermediate <b>achenes</b> are intermediate to those of central and peripheral <b>achenes.</b> We discuss how the morphological and dispersal characteristics of the three <b>achenes</b> types in G. papposus influenced the distribution of <b>achenes</b> to new areas, development of seedlings,population persistence and expansion, and competition among offspring. Heterocarpy may be {{partly responsible for the}} success of G. papposus in the Junggar desert...|$|R

Ripe <b>achenes</b> were collected in the cerrados of Itirapina and Moji Guaçu, State of São Paulo, Brazil. The storage conditions of the <b>achenes</b> varied in each experiment. <b>Achenes</b> were stored in darkness or light, in closed bottles, at 4 °C, 20 / 30 °C or 25 °C. <b>Achenes</b> were imbibed for 24 h at 4 °C, 25 °C or 20 / 30 °C (in darkness) and then stored for 1, 10, 20, 30 and 40 days (40 days only for 4 °C and 25 °C).

Some definitions make {{the mere presence of}} an internally differentiated endocarp the defining feature of a drupe; others qualify the nature of the endocarp required in a drupe, e.g. defining berries to have endocarp less than 2mm thick. The term [...] "drupaceous" [...] is used of fruits that have the general structure and texture of a drupe, without necessarily meeting the full definition.

40|$|AbstractDormancy and {{germination}} of dimorphic <b>achenes</b> {{have been}} compared {{within and between}} numerous species of Asteraceae, whereas only a few such comparisons have been made with trimorphic <b>achenes.</b> Garhadiolus papposus is an annual ephemeral species of disturbed desert habitats that produces three kinds of <b>achenes</b> that differ in size, morphology, pappus development and germination requirements. Fresh central <b>achenes</b> germinated to 10 – 21 % in light at 15 / 2 and 20 / 10  °C, while intermediate and peripheral <b>achenes</b> germinated to < 5 %. Germination was enhanced by excising the embryo in peripheral but not in intermediate <b>achenes.</b> For peripheral and intermediate <b>achenes,</b> pericarps and/or phyllaries did not inhibit germination of isolated embryos, indicating that water-soluble germination inhibitors were not present in these structures. For central and intermediate <b>achenes,</b> germination percentage increased with duration of dry storage at room temperature. Darkness decreased germination of central and intermediate <b>achenes,</b> while peripheral ones, which were viable, did not germinate at any condition.

Three sites were chosen {{in the local}} area of Uherské Hradiště: field (arable land), balk (adjacent to arable land) and rubble heap (distant from arable land). At each site, 50 plants were selected from which mature <b>achenes</b> were collected in 2002 and 2003. The <b>achenes</b> germinated in a laboratory at a room temperature and were subjected to various germination conditions. A part of them was exposed to the temperature of – 20  °C in a freezer, the other part was stored at a room temperature. The germination was carried out either on filter paper in Petri dishes or in 30  mm layer of siliceous sand. One part of the <b>achenes</b> germinated in daylight, the other part in Petri dishes in the dark. The <b>achenes</b> cultivated in siliceous sand were covered with a 5  mm layer of the sand.

We studied the reproductive biomass produced by plants from each seed morph, grown under different environmental conditions: at high and low nutrient levels, and at various densities of intraspecific and interspecific competition. In the absence of competition, {{there was no difference in}} reproductive biomass between the two morphs at high and low nutrient levels. In intraspecific competition, the plants derived from peripheral <b>achenes</b> dominated those derived from central <b>achenes.</b> In interspecific competition, the greater size of the embryo of peripheral <b>achenes</b> was advantageous at high density. The difference between morphs was more important in competition with an annual species of high RGR, Bromus madritensis, than with a perennial species of low RGR, Bromus erectus. The low weight of central <b>achenes</b> represents a disadvantage when competing with other annual species. Theory suggests that each seed morph must differ ecologically in order to maintain heteromorphism.

40|$|There {{are four}} major insect pests attacking <b>achenes</b> of {{sunflower}} in the Great Plains of North America (Charlet et al., 1987); the red sunflower seed weevil, Smicronyx fulvus LeConte (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), the gray sunflower seed weevil, S. sordidus LeConte (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), the banded sunflower moth, Cochylis hospes (Walsingham) (Lepidoptera: Cochylidae), and the sunflower moth, Homoeosoma electellum (Hulst) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Identification of <b>achenes</b> damaged by larvae {{of these species}} is important for assessment of yield loss caused by each species (Peng and Brewer, 1995). <b>Achenes</b> infested by the gray sunflower seed weevil are easily identified because they are enlarged and protrude above the surrounding <b>achenes</b> on intact sunflower heads and the kernel is entirely consumed (Brewer, 1991). Descriptions of <b>achenes</b> infested by larvae {{of the other three}} species are similar (Carlson, 1967; Oseto and Braness, 1979; McBride and Charlet, 1991) except for the location of feeding/exit holes {{on the surface of the}} <b>achenes</b> infested by the red sunflower seed weevil and banded sunflower moth (Charlet and Gross, 1990).
