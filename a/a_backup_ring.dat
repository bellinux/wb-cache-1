5000|$|It is {{important}} to use the terms [...] "differential backup" [...] and [...] "incremental backup" [...] correctly. The two terms are widely used in the industry, and their use is universally standard. <b>A</b> differential <b>backup</b> refers to <b>a</b> <b>backup</b> made to include the differences since the last full <b>backup,</b> while <b>an</b> incremental <b>backup</b> contains only the changes since the last incremental backup. (Or, of course, since the last full backup if the incremental backup in questions is the first incremental backup immediately after the last full backup.) All the major data backup vendors have standardized on these definitions, including Microsoft, Acronis, and Symantec. Microsoft, makers of Backup and Restore, defines incremental backups and differential backups as follows: [...] "Incremental: An incremental <b>backup</b> provides <b>a</b> <b>backup</b> of files that have changed or are new since the last incremental backup....Differential: <b>A</b> differential <b>backup</b> provides <b>a</b> <b>backup</b> of files that have changed since <b>a</b> full <b>backup</b> was performed. <b>A</b> differential <b>backup</b> typically saves only the files that are different or new since the last full backup, but this can vary in different <b>backup</b> programs. Together, <b>a</b> full <b>backup</b> and <b>a</b> differential <b>backup</b> include all the files on your computer, changed and unchanged." [...] Microsoft products, such as Exchange Server 2010 use this definition in their literature and support sites.|$|R
