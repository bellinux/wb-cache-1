5|$|A UNPA {{could be}} created through a {{stand-alone}} treaty. This {{would have the}} advantage that <b>as</b> <b>few</b> as 20 or 30 economically and geographically diverse countries could establish a UNPA, and it could expand as more countries ratified the treaty. Strauss notes {{that this is the}} method by which most international bodies, such the World Health Organization, International Labour Organization, and International Criminal Court, were founded. The way to get started presumably would be to hold a conference of plenipotentiaries to draft the treaty; then the ratification process would begin.|$|E

Scores in Varsity are typically lower than those in Scholastic, and those in Scholastic are typically lower than those in Honors.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>few</b> Susan B. Anthony dollars circulated, many remain {{available}} in uncirculated condition and are worth little above face value.

5|$|By {{the end of}} Henry's reign, Pain had {{witnessed}} over 60 royal charters for the king, spanning a period from around 1115 until 1135.

I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and I threw <b>as</b> <b>few</b> pitches as possible. That's why I was able to work every other day.|$|E
