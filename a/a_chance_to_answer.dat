5|$|The next morning, two detectives {{arrive at}} the {{apartment}} after Ed goes out, telling Scully that Ed's neighbor is missing and blood was found in her apartment with an unusual chemical substance in it. Scully researches the material on Ed's laptop and tries to call Mulder, but hangs up before Mulder has <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer.</b> When Ed arrives, Scully tells him that they found blood in his neighbor's apartment {{and that it was}} likely his. She thinks that the chemical came from the tattoo ink and wants them both to head to the hospital to be tested. Ed tells Scully about the voice he has been hearing from his tattoo.|$|E
5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering {{a new series of}} questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E
25|$|The four {{remaining}} teams {{stood on}} the topmost of the four levels of the Steps of Knowledge. Olmec began the round by telling the remaining teams the episode's legend of the featured artifact, which became the theme {{for the remainder of}} the episode. The legend centered on an artifact which the winning team searched for in the final round. At the end of the legend, Olmec told the teams the room in which the artifact could be found. After finishing, he asked the teams a series of questions to test their memory. Each multiple-choice question had three possible answers. A team attempting to answer signaled by stomping on a button on their step, causing the front of the step to illuminate (if Olmec was still in the middle of asking a question, he stopped talking immediately). A team who answered correctly moved down to the next level. If a team answered incorrectly or ran out of time (three seconds after being called upon), the other teams were given <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer.</b> The first two teams to answer three questions correctly and thereby reach the bottom level advanced to the next round.|$|E
50|$|All {{questions}} were multiple-choice, {{with a maximum}} value of 10 points each. Each question and its category were displayed on screen, with five choices and a 60-second timer. A correct answer {{on the first try}} awarded five points, with up to five bonus points depending on the response time. If time expired or an incorrect response was given, the timer was reset to 60 seconds and the team was given <b>a</b> second <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer.</b> Two points were awarded for a correct second-chance response, with no bonus.|$|R
5000|$|The three lifelines were 50:50, Ask the Audience, or Phone a Complete Stranger. Ask the Audience is immediate; the audience's answers can be {{instantly}} polled, {{because the}} audience already had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> enter their <b>answers.</b> Phone a Complete Stranger connected the contestant to a Cast Member outside the theater who found a guest to help.|$|R
30|$|The {{findings}} of the study suggest that participants may not provide 100 % exact <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> all their 3 challenge questions set out for this work, {{largely because of the}} usability challenges such as syntactic variation and memorability issues. The implementation of a traffic light system improved authentication outcome from 23 % to 92 %, by enabling multiple chances. However, during the abuse case scenario, the traffic light algorithm granted 2 out of 6 attackers <b>a</b> second <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> more challenge questions in order to re-authenticate. Nevertheless, the participants guessed correct answers on behalf of their friends and colleagues, largely because of poor question design.|$|R

2500|$|The [...] "UMNO 11" [...] {{case was}} just one of a number which had irritated Mahathir and the government. The case of the two journalists {{mentioned}} earlier had begun when John Berthelsen and Raphael Pura authored a series of articles on financial transactions of dubious ethical and legal nature carried out by government officials. The Asian Wall Street Journal which published them was promptly banned from the country, and Mahathir in his capacity as Home Affairs Minister had Berthelsen's and Pura's work permits revoked. However, the Supreme Court overturned the cancellation of Berthelsen's work permit because he had not been given <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> the charges of the government. As a result, the ban on the Asian Wall Street Journal was also lifted. In a different case, the Supreme Court used its power of judicial review, and nullified amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code which gave the Attorney-General the power to initiate criminal proceedings in the High Court without first going to a Magistrate's Court. After Operation Lalang in 1987, where the government detained several political dissidents without trial under the Internal Security Act (ISA), the High Court granted Karpal Singh's application to be released from detention due to [...] technicalities in the way he had been detained.|$|E

30|$|Our {{analysis}} showed that {{the psychometric properties of}} the assessment instrument with the inclusion of DCVs in the assessment items demonstrated acceptable reliability and high construct validity. The most difficult item required studentsâ€™ reverse thought processes in order to predict the movement of the solution. In order <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> this question correctly, students would need to critically consider the variables given in the target system, analyze the dynamic nature of molecule movement, and then apply their understanding from the macroscopic level to associate with potential impact on the microscopic mechanisms (for more details about student reasoning, see Zhang et al. 2015). Therefore, the integration of DCVs in the osmosis assessment in VB did not provide them with <b>a</b> better <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> this innovative assessment item. This is probably due to the DCVsâ€™ stress on the microscopic interactions rather than the introduction of explicit connections between macroscopic and microscopic relationship.|$|R
50|$|Three lottery {{retailers}} {{played a}} qualifying round {{in which they}} answered survey questions asked to people all over New York. The host read each question {{one at a time}} and gave three possible answers. The first player <b>to</b> buzz-in had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> choose one of those answers. A correct answer (the number one response in the survey) scored a point, but an incorrect answer gave the other contestants <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> buzz-in and <b>answer,</b> and another incorrect answer from another player gave the remaining player the point by default. The first player to score three points played for the jackpot; the remaining two players played a second qualifying round.|$|R
50|$|In each round, four {{categories}} each with three point values (10, 20 & 30 points) were {{displayed on a}} video wall. The player in control selected a category, then host Brady asked a question.

The family gets a [...] "strike" [...] if a player gives an answer that is not on the board or fails to respond. There is no firm time limit, but the host has the discretion to impose a three-second count if time is short or the contestant appears to be stalling. Three strikes cause the family to relinquish control of the board, giving the other family one <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> steal the points in the bank by correctly guessing one of the remaining answers.|$|R
500|$|Contestants {{were given}} the {{standard}} three lifelines {{in place at the}} time (50:50, Ask the Audience, and Phone-a-Friend) {{at the beginning of the}} game. However, after correctly answering the $100,000 question, the contestant earned two additional lifelines: Three Wise Men and Double Dip. The Three Wise Men lifeline involved a panel of three experts, one of whom was always a former Millionaire contestant and at least one of whom was female. When this lifeline was used, the contestant and panel had 30 seconds to discuss the question and choices before the audio and video feeds were dropped. Double Dip gave <b>a</b> contestant two <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> question. Once used, no further lifelines could be used; moreover, if the [...] "first final answer" [...] was incorrect, the contestant could not walk away. If the [...] "second final answer" [...] was also wrong, the contestant left with $100,000.|$|R
40|$|The {{foundations}} of proteomics are to study gene products and their regulatory roles within cells. Paradoxically, {{the only evidence}} that sperm cells make new proteins is through mitochondrial protein synthesis. Yet despite this, spermatozoa are the perfect candidates for mass spectrometry and hence, proteomic analysis. These enterprising cells use a plethora of post-translational modifications {{in order to gain}} functionality following their production within the testis. By using a combination of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2 D-PAGE), and more recently liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) /MS, recent advances in sperm cell biology, through the use of proteomics, is making unparalleled progress. The protein inventory lists being generated have shed light on transmembrane proteins, kinases and chaperones never previously recognized. In addition, the ability to isolate either phosphopeptides or glycopeptides and quantify the differences between cells of two different populations make proteomic analysis of spermatozoa <b>a</b> real <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> finally <b>answer</b> some age old questions...|$|R

Each question had four possible answers which were revealed one at a time. A player could buzz in with a guess at any time, as long as at least one answer had been revealed. A correct answer scored money for the team. An incorrect answer lost money, {{at which point the}} opposing team could take <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> as the remaining answers were revealed. A team also lost money for buzzing in before at least one answer was revealed; if this happened, all four answers were immediately revealed and the opposing team was given <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|E

The feature is 'hosted' by voice samples of the Northern Irish comedian and original Catchphrase presenter, Roy Walker. Simple and reasonably-obvious catchphrases are chosen and the anecdotal clue often involves the fictional character Mr Fish, a reference to Mr Chips from the original game show. The game is played as a best-of-3 knockout and the prize is the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> compete again when the feature returns (though this was usually ignored if the contestants were entertaining enough, usually with Moyles wiping points off), usually in the next show.

40|$|International audienceMany Web {{applications}} {{are based on}} dynamic interactions between Web components exchanging flows of information. Such a situation arises for instance in mashup systems or when monitoring distributed autonomous systems. This is a challenging problem that has generated recently a lot of attention; see Web 2. 0. For capturing interactions between Web components, we use active documents interacting {{with the rest of}} the world via streams of updates. Their input streams specify updates to the document (in the spirit of RSS feeds), whereas their output streams are defined by queries on the document. In most of the paper, the focus is on input streams where the updates are only insertions, although we do consider also deletions. We introduce and study two fundamental concepts in this setting, namely, satisfiability and relevance. Some fact is satisfiable for an active document and a query if it has <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> be in the result of the query in some future state. Given an active document and a query, a call in the document is relevant if the data brought by this call has <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> impact the <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> the query. We analyze the complexity of computing satisfiability in our core model (insertions only) and for extensions (e. g., with deletions). We also analyze the complexity of computing relevance in the core model...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} ways that critics writing {{in the early nineteenth}} century {{developed}} arguments in favor of what we think of today as the humanities in the face of utilitarian pressures that dismissed the arts as self-indulgent pursuits incapable of addressing real-world problems. Its focus reflects the extent to which the financial crisis in our own day has manifested itself in a jarring shift in research priorities towards applied knowledge: a retrenchment which has foregrounded all over again the question of how to make the case for the value of the humanities. These problems, however, also constitute an important opportunity: <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> re-imagine our <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> questions about the nature and role of the humanities, their potential benefits to contemporary life, and how we might channel these benefits back into the larger society. The good news is that in many ways, this self-reflexive challenge is precisely what the humanities have always done best: highlight the nature and the force of the narratives that have helped to define how we understand our societyâ€”its various pasts and its possible futuresâ€”and to suggest the larger contexts within which these issues must ultimately be situated. History repeats itself, but never in quite the same way: knowing more about past debates will provide a crucial basis for moving forward as we position themselves to respond to new social, economic, technological, and cultural challenges during an age of radical change...|$|R
