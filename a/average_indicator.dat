As previously stated, {{it was not possible}} to have an accurate percentage of areas exposed to coastal flooding in Saintes-Maries-de-la-mer and but it represents almost the whole surface area of the study site. On the contrary, respondents from Barneville-Carteret and Sainte-Anne had the highest <b>average</b> <b>indicators</b> of over-assessment and the lowest indicators of under-assessment whereas both study sites had the lowest percentage of areas exposed to coastal flooding of their entire surface areas (respectively 12 % and 2.5 %). To sum up, respondents from study sites which presented the highest rate of areas exposed to coastal flooding are more likely to under-assess the spatial extent of those areas.|$|R

The average indicators of under-assessment (78 %) were {{higher than the average}} indicators of over-assessment (44 %) for all study sites. Thus, respondents were more likely to under-assess than over-assess the spatial extent of areas exposed to coastal flooding.

Despite the fact that the average indicators of over-assessment and under-assessment of respondents in Saintes-Maries-de-la-mer were less precise in their calculation than the other study sites, they provided information about the general trend of individuals’ perception of the spatial extent of areas exposed to coastal flooding. In fact, respondents that lived in this municipality are more likely to under-assess than over-assess the exposed areas.|$|E

Giving a higher weight to species {{at both ends of}} the indicator scale and using indifferent species as indicators of mediocre conditions did improve the correlation significantly. Weighting species proportionate to their cover yielded a significantly lower correlation than the correlation obtained with the method that disregards cover.

Second, we performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of the variations of several parameters on model outputs. Sensitivity analysis shows that the most influent input parameters, at a global scale, are speed, then traffic flow. Propagation of uncertainties was performed on those parameters.
