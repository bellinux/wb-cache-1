5|$|Robert Frank, a {{professor}} of child development at Oakton Community College in Illinois, conducted a study comparing households with a stay-at-home dad and households with <b>a</b> <b>stay-at-home</b> <b>mom.</b> His study concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full-time outside the home. Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children {{on a day-to-day basis}} than their male counterparts. His study concluded that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong. This contrasts with the more traditional family structure where the father works outside the home and the mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.|$|E

5000|$|... “Mommy Wars," [...] as {{introduced}} by Nina Darnton in a June 1990 Newsweek article, represents the media-staged tensions between <b>stay-at-home</b> <b>moms</b> and working <b>moms.</b> <b>Stay-at-home</b> <b>moms</b> criticize working moms for abandoning {{their children and}} homes to build a personal career, while working <b>moms</b> resent <b>stay-at-home</b> <b>moms</b> both {{because of the time}} and attention they are able to devote to their children, and because of the notion that a mother is only [...] "good enough" [...] if she can devote all her time and attention to the children and household. Susan Podnieks argues that The Mommy Myth, as well as the so-called battle between working <b>moms</b> and <b>stay-at-home</b> <b>moms,</b> are circulated by news media and talk shows, sparking debates about the proper sphere of women. As a result, the general public believes that [...] "there is a bitter war in the suburban cul-de-sacs of the United States between the complacent minivan-driving <b>stay-at-home</b> <b>moms</b> and the overachieving soon-to-be-burnout working mothers who still think they can have it all." [...] This leads to grouping mothers into rigid and rival categories, leading them to feel insecure about their mothering, and in turn leading them to devalue other mothers in order to elevate themselves.|$|R

[...] In the mid-1990s, she began suffering from severe migraine headaches, for a while keeping them secret from her husband and minimizing their effect to the rest of her family.

500|$|The stay-at-home dad {{arrangement}} {{allows the}} mother {{to work without}} having to use a daycare or a nanny. This arrangement prevents the mother from {{having to deal with}} the stress of finding acceptable childcare, checking backgrounds, and paying for care. This arrangement also can help ensure that the family's values are being upheld and instilled in the children. Free from the stress of childcare, the working mother is able to actively pursue their career. This allows for a more relaxed working environment for the mother and allows her to focus on her career. [...] If the mother has a higher paying job, this extra income will allow for savings to be made for the children, these savings could help the mother later on pay for university for the child and/or children. Thus, she can advance her career and provide more money for the family. It puts a sound mind for the mother knowing that the child/children are at a safe place with the father having the same safety and values as the mother. These are the same advantages for the father from having <b>a</b> <b>stay-at-home</b> <b>mom</b> arrangement.|$|E
