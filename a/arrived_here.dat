25|$|The Spanish <b>arrived</b> <b>here</b> in 1528, {{killing the}} local Aztec governor, Ixcóatl. Credit for the Spanish {{conquest of the}} Pachuca area has been given Francisco Téllez, an artilleryman who came to Mexico with Hernán Cortés in 1519. He and Gonzalo Rodriguez were the first Spaniards here, {{constructing}} two feudal estates, and calling the area Real de Minas de Pachuca. Téllez was also given credit for laying out the colonial city of Pachuca on the European model but this story has been proven false, with no alternative version.|$|E

In the winter of 1833-34, it concentrated in Dublin, and in February 1834 was ordered to Canada. Here, it garrisoned Halifax, with detachments on some outlying islands. In June 1837, following political unrest in Lower Canada, it moved to Quebec, and in December to Montreal. They <b>arrived</b> <b>here</b> two days before the Battle of Saint-Eustache, where they were one of three government regiments engaged in defeating the Patriote militia.|$|E
25|$|Cape Breton Island {{is notable}} for its mining industry. When explorers and {{settlers}} <b>arrived</b> <b>here</b> in the 17th and 18th centuries, they {{were focused on}} the coal, which was discovered in rocks and cliffs. Coal was used to heat houses and factories, used by blacksmiths to mold iron, and for the steam engines of trains. Coal was extracted principally in the Sydney–Glace Bay area of Cape Breton Island, until the mines were closed in 2001. Many mines have shut down as coal becomes a less popular fuel. Despite this, Nova Scotia still gets most of its electricity from coal, most of which is now imported. Some of Cape Breton's mines have been turned into tourist attractions and museums, and retired miners take people on tours of old mines.|$|E

25|$|According to tradition, Father Neri <b>arrived</b> <b>here</b> from preaching at {{missions}} in Dolores Hidalgo. While resting under a mesquite tree where the sanctuary is now located, he dreamt of Jesus wearing {{a crown of}} thorns and carrying a cross. Jesus told Father Neri {{that it was his}} will that the area be converted into a place for penance and prayer. A different version of this story states that Father Neri was here due to his ill health and was assisting at a small church called the Capilla de San Miguelito, which is still found {{on the banks of the}} Laja River. At that time, the native Guachichiles and Pames were not completely converted to Christianity and considered the thermal springs in the area sacred and medicinal. It was also supposedly a favored place for rites that included fornication. One reason to build the church was to counter this practice.|$|E

The Athens Banner described the team's arrival for a game with Georgia: [...] "The Commodores <b>arrived</b> <b>here</b> at one o'clock Friday afternoon, and were whisked directly to the Georgian Hotel. Curious hundreds of Bulldog supporters shuddered at the procession of Vandy giants as they strolled down the sidewalks, led by Huge Tot McCullough, with spry Froggy Miers and clever Doc Kuhn bringing up the rear." [...] Kuhn dropped back, throwing Lynn Bomar a 40-plus-yard pass for Vanderbilt's second touchdown in its 12–0 victory over Georgia at Sanford Field.|$|E

500|$|Mount Ślęża {{formation}} is believed {{by many to}} have been a place of exceptional cult significance, over many centuries, possibly going back {{all the way to the}} Lusatian times, but especially for the Celts. Chronicler Thietmar of Merseburg mentions in the early 11th century the mountain as a place surrounded by adoration because of its size and the [...] "cursed" [...] pagan ceremonies carried out there. The summits of this and of the neighboring mountains are circled by stone rings and monumental sculptures. Diagonalized cross signs found on many of the stone objects may have had their origin in the Hallstatt - Lusatian solar cult. Such signs can also be seen on the massive [...] "monk" [...] stone sculpture (actually looking more like a simple chess figure or a skittles pin) that was located inside the largest stone ring on Mount Ślęża itself and is therefore believed to originate from the Hallstatt cultural circles. The stone rings also contain fragments of Lusatian ceramics. The younger sculptures ("Maiden with a fish", [...] "Mushroom" [...] and the bear figures) have their distant counterparts in the Iberian Peninsula Celtic art and are thought to be the work of the Celtic people, who developed the Ślęża cult center further. After that the Mount Ślęża area cult was probably revived by the Slavs, who <b>arrived</b> <b>here</b> in early Middle Ages.|$|E

In the 1880s, the ukulele was created, based on two small guitar-like instruments of Madeiran origin, the cavaquinho and the rajao.

Three immigrants in particular, Madeiran cabinet makers Manuel Nunes, José do Espírito Santo, and Augusto Dias, are generally credited as the first ukulele makers.
