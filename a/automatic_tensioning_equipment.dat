40|$|Lasers {{are being}} used in various {{surgical}} proce- dures to remove tissue or bones, to coagulate vessels or other structures. Due to difficulties in handling {{only a limited number}} of surgeons manage to display sufficient levels of precision in Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) procedures. Prior works on robotic laser surgery demonstrated shorter learning curves and higher ablation precision, but unfortunately ignored the fact that most clinically relevant tasks are bi-manual by nature. Surgeons are also reluctant to use current commercial surgical robotic systems for complex laser tasks, indicating that the lack of haptic feedback prevents them from efficient and safe tissue handling in preparation of laser treatment. This paper expands earlier robotic laser work towards bi-manual operation. The paper introduces a system for precisely tensioning tissue that is being targeted by the laser. An artificial test-setup that captures some essential features of bimanual laser surgery is described. Experiments have been conducted to investigate the effect of haptic feedback on ablation performance. A comparison is made of achievable levels of ablation precision when there is no haptic feedback, when there is haptic feedback and when an <b>automatic</b> <b>tension</b> control algorithm is deployed.

30|$|Based on the {{variation}} of tensile force during the start, stop {{and operation of}} belt conveyor, a <b>tension</b> technology and <b>equipment</b> of high accuracy and large tensioning stroke has been developed. It can quickly respond and automatically adjust tension and tensioning stroke with the tension variation of the belt conveyor. During normal operations, the tensile force is 0.9 – 1.1 times of the rated tensile force, during start and stop, the tensile force is 1.3 – 1.4 times of the rated tensile force, and during the shift of conveyor tail, the equipment can quickly respond and guarantee non-skid. The working principle is: based on the conveyor’s start-up and loading, with the feedback of tension sensor signal, the PLC controller and fuel tank can automatically adjust the output of tensile force to avoid slipping between belts and drive pulley, lower the safety factor selected for the belt, and ensure the normal operation of the belt conveyor. Installed with an automatic moved conveyor tail, the <b>automatic</b> <b>tensioning</b> can be achieved when the conveyor tail is automatically moved, thus to a certain extent, the downtime rate of the belt conveyor and the downtime rate of the three face machine can be reduced.|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to examine the possible interaction between the cholinergic transmitter and the reactivity of gastric arteries to adrenergic activation. Helical strips of dogs' gastric arteries were mounted for <b>automatic</b> <b>tension</b> recording. The strips contracted on exposure to norepinephrine; these contractions were inhibited by phenoxybenzamine. Electrical stimulation caused an increase in tension, which was abolished by tetrodotoxin and phenoxybenzamine. indicating that electrical stimulation causes contraction by liberation of norepinephrine. Acetylcholine did not alter basal tension; it caused relaxation during responses to electrical stimulation, but not during those to norepinephrine. The relaxation caused by acetylcholine was abolished by atropine. This indicates that acetylcholine inhibits adrenergic neurotransmission in the dog's gastric artery. When added during electrical stimulation, atropine caused an increase in tension. The same concentrations of atropine did not affect basal tension or the response to norepinephrine. Physostigmine depresses the response to electrical stimulation, but not that to norepinephrine. In the blood-perfused stomach of the intact dog, vagal stimulation depressed vasoconstrictions caused by sympathetic nerve stimulation more than comparable constrictor responses obtained with the infusion of norepinephrine. These experiments suggest that liberated acetylcholine can modulate adrenergic neurotransmission in the gastric blood vessels.

The Rational-Spline Approximation with <b>Automatic</b> <b>Tension</b> Adjustment algorithm {{lead to a}} flexible, smooth representation of experimental data.

The selection of these quantities depends on the actual data and on the requirements of a particular application.

The level of precision required in Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) represents a challenge for the limited number of surgeons that prove to master the technique. Prior works on robotic laser surgery demonstrated shorter learning curves and higher ablation precision, but unfortunately ignored the fact that most clinically relevant tasks are bi-manual by nature. However, current commercial surgical robotic systems are not recommended for complex laser tasks in favor of more conventional practices. Lack of haptic feedback remains as a main argument to refuse the benefits of robotics in surgery. In cases on which tissue handling is of special difficulty during preparation of laser treatment, efficiency and safety of the manipulation do not reach the levels of manual laparoscopy. This communication introduces recent work in the direction of bi-manual operation. A tissue that is targeted by the laser is precisely manipulated and tensioned by a robotic system. The manipulation is performed by means of teleoperation with different levels of interaction, position teleoperation, haptic feedback and autotensioning feature. Essential features of bimanual laser surgery are studied on an artificial test-setup.

30|$|The {{tensioning}} {{stress distribution}} of {{circular saw blade}} after roll tensioning was described by Szymani [2]. In the inner loop of the tensioned region, the tangential tensioning stress is compressive, and its value increases gradually from loop of the tensioned region to inside. In the exterior loop of the tensioned region, the tangential tensioning stress is tensile, and its value decreases gradually from loop of the tensioned region to outside. This distribution of tangential tensioning stress is not very ideal relatively. The tangential tensioning stresses of circular saw blades tensioned by three levels of hammering were measured by X-ray stress meter [3, 4]. The tangential tensioning stress outside hammer region increases with radius, which is an ideal distribution. This phenomenon indicates that the distribution of tangential tensioning stress produced by hammering is more reasonable than that produced by roll tensioning. However, hammer tensioning has its limitations because the hammer tensioning creates a very irregular surface and produce localized, non-axisymmetric stresses because the force and position of spots are controlled by workers and its reproducibility and controllability {{are very difficult to}} be mastered, and it depends heavily on the experience and skills of saw repairing workers. The precision of hammer tensioning is relatively poor. Multi-spot pressure tensioning process is one kind of tensioning methods and a quasi-static process. The fixed areas of circular saw blade are pressed by spherical or cylindrical surface during multi-spot pressure tensioning process. The force and position of spots are controlled precisely by automated machinery during the multi-spot pressure tensioning process. A cyclic symmetry stress distribution and appropriate macroscopic deformation can be obtained by the multi-spot pressure tensioning process. Therefore, a more ideal distribution of tangential tensioning stress is produced during multi-spot pressure tensioning process. This tensioning approach is conducive to the realization of the <b>automatic</b> <b>tensioning</b> operation, especially in the production of ultra-thin circular saw blades.|$|R

Average annual DOC fluxes of the 30 AETPLS were 4. 9 g C m(- 2) y(- 1) at 0. 4 m and 2. 4 g C m(- 2) y(- 1) at 1. 2 m depth. The average leachate DOC concentrations were 17 mg C L(- 1) (0. 4 m) and 9 mg C L(- 1) (1. 2 m). The DOC concentrations were unrelated to soil moisture content or average temperature and rarely dropped below 9 mg C L(- 1) (0. 4 m) and 5 mg C L(- 1) (1. 2 m). The variability in cumulative DOC fluxes among the plates was positively related to leachate volume and not to average DOC concentrations at both depths. This suggests that water fluxes are the main determinants of spatial variability in DOC fluxes. However, the largest DOC concentrations were inversely proportional to the mean water velocity between succeeding sampling periods, suggesting that the maximal net DOC mobilization rate in the topsoil is limited. Elevated DOC concentrations, up to 90 mg C L(- 1), were only observed at low water velocities, reducing the risks of DOC-facilitated transport of contaminants to groundwater.

It is important to evaluate the instruments’ performance with automatically regulated suction because the efficiency of the control and its effects on the flux volumes could vary with the surrounding soil matric potential. An <b>automatic</b> equilibrium <b>tension</b> lysimeter (AETL) system was developed composed of 16 small-area (572 cm 2) ceramic suction plates that were continuously kept in equilibrium by an automated control device. The automated control device consisted of a datalogger connected to electronic tensiometers and to an electric vacuum pump that was activated to regulate the ceramic plate suction. The system was evaluated by simulating its performance with the HYDRUS- 2 D finite-element model. The AETL system continuously kept the lysimeters’ suction in equilibrium with the surrounding soil when the soil water matric potential head ranged from 2306 to 0 cm H 2 O. Suction control was less effective during low drainage conditions (soil matric potential head less than 250 cm H 2 O), when it took more time to re-equilibrate the pressure heads. However analysis of the variability of drainage and model simulations showed that incorrect suction control in drier conditions had a limited effect on the collected volumes. Suction was much better controlled when drainage flux was high, allowing a correct estimate of drainage. Automatic control of suction plates is a valuable tool for estimating drainage fluxes. Fine control of suction is needed when drainage flux is high because even the slight overapplication of suction, which is typically done during field experiments to overcome porous plate resistance and ensure that a sample is collected, could produce marked overestimation of water drainage (. 30 %) ...|$|R

The SA-alcohol use literature to date has not examined implicit cognition. Moreover, the influence of mood on drinking has been explored using performance-based mood manipulations, which may inhibit alcohol use for fear of impairing performance. The present study aimed to develop an ecologically valid socially-relevant mood manipulation and examine its effects on implicit alcohol cognitions and drinking outcomes. It was hypothesized that SA would influence the <b>automatic</b> activation of <b>tension</b> reduction alcohol cognitions and drinking behaviour, only for those in an anxious mood. Undergraduates (N = 132; 86 % women) completed self-reports of SA and alcohol use/problems, were randomly assigned to an anxious or control mood condition, completed an implicit task, and self-reported urge to drink. Results revealed that mood moderated the effect of SA on urge to drink. When in an anxious mood, those high in SA reported an elevated urge to drink for negative and positive reinforcement purposes. There was little support for the role of implicit alcohol cognition. The activation of implicit cognition in the lab was not associated with drinking status. While the role of implicit cognition in the SA-drinking risk pathway did not receive much support, the current study incorporated a socially-relevant lab-based mood manipulation that was effective in eliciting the urge to drink...|$|R
