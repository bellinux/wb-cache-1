5|$|Moncton lies {{in southeastern}} New Brunswick, at the {{geographic}} {{centre of the}} Maritime Provinces. The city is located along the north bank of the Petitcodiac River <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the river bends acutely from a west−east to north−south flow. This geographical feature has contributed significantly to historical names given to the community.|$|E
5|$|The {{sculpture}} predates 300 BC, {{based on}} {{the style of the}} hieroglyphic text, and is thought to be an Early Maya monument that was intended to represent an Early Maya ruler (at the base) who carried the underworld (i.e. the bat) and his ancestors (the main figure above carrying a smaller figure on its back). The Maya sculptor used half-remembered Olmec stylistic elements upon the ancestor figure in a form of Maya-Olmec syncretism, producing a hybrid sculpture. As such it represents the transition from one cultural phase to the next, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the earlier Olmec inhabitants had not yet been forgotten and were viewed as powerful ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{are incorporated into}} eruption columns as they are ejected from the vent at high velocity. The initial momentum from the eruption propels the column upwards. As air is drawn into the column, the bulk density decreases and it starts to rise buoyantly into the atmosphere. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the bulk density of the column {{is the same as}} the surrounding atmosphere, the column will cease rising and start moving laterally. Lateral dispersion is controlled by prevailing winds and the ash may be deposited hundreds to thousands of kilometres from the volcano, depending on eruption column height, particle size of the ash and climatic conditions (especially wind direction and strength and humidity).|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} of Bronze Age and Roman activity in the area. A Late Bronze Age axe head dating to around 1000-801 BC was found near Fields Farm Fisheries in Bradwall. Around a thousand Roman coins dating from not earlier than 270 AD were discovered in 1820, {{on the eastern side}} of Bradwall, a short distance from the Brindley Moor's Farm and about four miles direct from the Roman station at Kinderton, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> a small brook is crossed by the footpath from Brereton to Sandbach. Discovered by a mole-catcher, the coins included examples of denarii of Gallienus, Claudius II, Tetricus, Victorinus, and Diocletian. The remains of part of a Roman road, are also thought to have been discovered near the western side of Bradwall, by Boothlane, towards the west of Sandbach, and near King Street. Since the 1936 parish boundary changes, the road's location is now in Elworth on Roman Way in Sandbach Parish.|$|E
5|$|The next lock is Compton Lock, {{the only}} one built on a river section. It is also called Compton Place Lock or Twyford Lock, and the extra flow {{compared}} to other locks may explain the erosion that has taken place, resulting in a circular area of water between {{the upper and lower}} gates. Just above Shawford Bridge, the river and navigation diverged, with Shawford Mill just below the junction. The building still stands. The bridge is a modern construction, and is located <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the towpath crosses to the western bank. Just to the south is a weir at the site of Shawford Single Gates, which probably ensured the mill had an adequate head of water. The village of Twyford lies to the east, and the Twyford Drain splits, with the western channel rejoining the river below the mill, and the eastern channel continuing as a relief channel. There are two more locks on the navigation, called Malm Lock and College Mead Lock, before the navigation rejoins the river. By the junction is the intake for Otterbourne Water Treatment Works.|$|E

25|$|Occasionally, {{a station}} serves {{two or more}} railway lines at differing levels.

25|$|In micro{{economic}}s, {{supply and}} demand is an economic model of price determination in a market.

25|$|A special type of integrator, used <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> only {{moderate}} accuracy was needed, {{was based}} on a steel ball, instead of a disc. It had two inputs, one to rotate the ball, and the other to define the angle of the ball's rotating axis. That axis was always in a plane that contained the axes of two movement-pickoff rollers, quite similar to the mechanism of a rolling-ball computer mouse (in this mechanism, the pickoff rollers were roughly the same diameter as the ball). The pickoff roller axes were at right angles.|$|E

25|$|The main Ottoman {{force of}} {{between two and}} a half and three divisions, {{estimated}} between 6,000 and 16,000 rifles, were deployed at Tel el Negile and Huj with detachments at Tel esh Sheria, Jemmameh, Hareira, Beersheba, and Gaza, to prevent the EEF from out-flanking Gaza. The rear of the EEF was to be attacked by the Ottoman 16th Division, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the road from Khan Yunis to Gaza crossed the Wadi Ghuzze, and by the Beersheba Group which was to advance via Shellal, to attack Khan Yunis.|$|E
25|$|Appalachia is {{characterized}} by winding narrow coves and hidden hollows separated by high ridges. Many of these hollows contained just enough bottomland to support an economy based on subsistence agriculture, but with each crop, the soil grew poorer and poorer. Thus, to make ends meet, farmers in communities such as Cosby and Del Rio began setting aside some of their corn crop for liquor production. These early distillers found an easy market in the taverns and saloons of Newport, itself located <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the Appalachian highlands meet the Tennessee Valley.|$|E
25|$|Ozone in the {{stratosphere}} is mostly produced from short-wave ultraviolet rays between 240 and 160nm. Oxygen starts to absorb weakly at 240nm in the Herzberg bands, {{but most of the}} oxygen is dissociated by absorption in the strong Schumann–Runge bands between 200 and 160nm where ozone does not absorb. While shorter wavelength light, extending to even the X-Ray limit, is energetic enough to dissociate molecular oxygen, there is relatively little of it, and, the strong solar emission at Lyman-alpha, 121nm, falls <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> molecular oxygen absorption is a minimum.|$|E

25|$|The journey, a {{distance}} of over a mile <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the tides run swiftly, was a dangerous one, and its reputation, the roughness of the water, and the smallness of the boats deterred travellers. Daniel Defoe visited the crossing from the Aust side in the 18th century, but did not trust the ferry to survive the bad weather, and elected to go via Gloucester instead. By that time, ferry crossings from New Passage, between Redwick near Pilning and Sudbrook on the Welsh side, rivalled the Aust passage, which {{became known as the}} Old Passage.|$|E

The settlement thus established {{because it was a}} good landing place: it was also sheltered by the prominent height of what is now called Windmill Hill (see Landmarks below); although Windmill Hill still remains a dominant feature, Gravesend's highest point is actually further inland at Marling Cross, adjacent to the A2.|$|E
25|$|A {{difficulty}} {{encountered in}} the creation of models is that often Leonardo had not entirely thought through the mechanics of a machine before he drew it, or else he used a sort of graphic shorthand, simply not bothering to draw a gear or a lever <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> one is essential {{in order to make a}} machine function. This lack of refinement of mechanical details can cause considerable confusion. Thus many models that are created, such as some of those on display at Clos Luce, Leonardo's home in France, do not work, but would work, with a little mechanical tweaking.|$|E
