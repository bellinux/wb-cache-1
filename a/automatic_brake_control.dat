40|$|AbstractThis paper {{measures}} the performance parameter {{of the automobile}} braking system with Electronic Vacuum Booster (EVB) through real vehicle experiment. According to the data collected from the experiment, the performance parameters of EVBs in different cars are not the same. The performance parameters of the EVB in both test cars can be separated into three parts. For example, when the desired braking intension, in other words the input signal of electronic vacuum booster, is less than 7, the braking effect is not obvious; when the desired braking intension is between 7 ∼ 40, {{the relationship between the}} desired braking intension and the acceleration is found to be linear variation; when the desired braking intension is greater than 40, the wheels will be locked and the acceleration is constant. Then we get the performance parameter of automobile braking system with electronic vacuum booster through linear regression.

40|$|The {{beginning}} of the 21 st century sees auto makers pursuing research in advanced features like collision warning and avoidance system into their product. Automotive cruise control system has been undergoing development in EU since the PROMETHEUS programme in the late 1980 ’s, and has currently metamorphous into Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) technology which is presently emerging in the automotive market as a convenience function intended to reduce driver workload. Adaptive cruise control {{is the first of}} the new generation of advanced driver’s assistance devices to reach the market, which partially automates the driver’s task and bringing the drivers comfort into perspective. It allows the host vehicle to maintain a set speed and distance from preceding vehicles by a forward object detection sensor. The forward object detection sensor is {{the focal point of the}} ACC system, which determines and regulates vehicle acceleration and deceleration through a powertrain torque control system and an <b>automatic</b> <b>brake</b> <b>control</b> system. This study presents overview of adaptive cruise control system, operation principles and the advantages of integrating ACC system in automobiles. Also, the system must be stable for optimum performance, and stability of a close loop system which the cruise system is an example, was determined by calculating the controller gain (K 1, K 2, K 3) and substituting into the characteristic equations. The stability of a close loop system for the values of K 1, K 2 and K 3 when substituted into the characteristic equation produced a negative real part. To achieve stability in close loop systems, all the poles must have negative real values and this is in line with the values obtain for p 1, p 2 and p 3.

40|$|Environmental {{perception}} and information processing are two key steps of active safety for vehicle reversing. Single-sensor environmental perception cannot meet {{the need for}} vehicle reversing safety due to its low reliability. In this paper, we present a novel multi-sensor environmental perception method using low-rank representation and a particle filter for vehicle reversing safety. The proposed system consists of four main steps, namely multi-sensor environmental perception, information fusion, target recognition and tracking using low-rank representation and a particle filter, and vehicle reversing speed control modules. First of all, the multi-sensor environmental perception module, based on a binocular-camera system and ultrasonic range finders, obtains the distance data for obstacles behind the vehicle when the vehicle is reversing. Secondly, the information fusion algorithm using an adaptive Kalman filter is used to process the data obtained with the multi-sensor environmental perception module, which greatly improves the robustness of the sensors. Then {{the framework of a}} particle filter and low-rank representation is used to track the main obstacles. The low-rank representation is used to optimize an objective particle template that has the smallest L- 1 norm. Finally, the electronic throttle opening and <b>automatic</b> <b>braking</b> is under <b>control</b> of the proposed vehicle reversing control strategy prior to any potential collisions, making the reversing control safer and more reliable. The final system simulation and practical testing results demonstrate the validity of the proposed multi-sensor environmental perception method using low-rank representation and a particle filter for vehicle reversing safety...|$|R
