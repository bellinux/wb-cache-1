40|$|This {{study was}} {{investigated}} {{for the purpose}} of obtaining basic data for application to the canning process of salt-fer-mented anchovy Engraulis japonica fillet using tomato paste. The salt fermented <b>anchovy</b> <b>fillet</b> was prepared by fer-menting <b>anchovy</b> <b>fillet</b> with salt 15 % at 5 ℃ for 15 days and then cold air drying the salt-fermented <b>anchovy</b> <b>fillet</b> for 1 h at 16 ± 1 ℃. The dried salt-fermented <b>anchovy</b> <b>fillet</b> 85 g was filled with 60 g of tomato paste sauce (tomato paste 42 %, gum guar 1. 0 %, salt 2. 0 %, starch syrup 2. 0 %, cooking wine 1 %, water 52 %) and seamed by vacuum seamer in 301 - 3 can, then sterilized at Fo 9 and 11 min in a steam system retort at 121 ℃, respectively. The factors such as chemical composition, pH, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), amino-N, color value (L, a, b), texture profile, thio-barbituric acid (TBA) value, sensory evaluation and viable bacterial count of the canned salt-fermented <b>anchovy</b> <b>fillet</b> were measured. Texture value of the product sterilized at Fo 11 min was higher than at Fo 9 min condition. In both sterilized cans, the viable bacterial counts were not detected. There was no remarkable difference in physicochemica...|$|E

5000|$|Canned <b>anchovy</b> <b>fillets</b> found {{commonly}} in the US are intensely salty and {{are often}} removed of skin and bones. Often, they are marked as [...] "Product of Morocco," [...] which are salted-matured <b>anchovy</b> <b>fillets.</b> Canned anchovetas sold in Peru and other places are extremely similar to the canned sardines widely available in the US, hence the name [...] "Peruvian sardines". Recently new ways of preparation for the anchovetas have been developed in Peru, therefore new products {{are already in the}} international market like anchoveta chicharrones, anchoveta jerky meat, anchoveta paste and anchoveta steaks.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the acceptance of fermented anchovy (Engraulis anchoita) by consumers aged 18 – 67 (n= 100) from two experiments, first using preference test and then by acceptance of formulation preference. <b>Anchovy</b> <b>fillets</b> were fermented with added NaCl and glucose with 4 different treatments: A (NaCl 1 % and glucose 4 %), B (NaCl 1 % and glucose 6 %), C (NaCl 1. 5 % and glucose 4 %), and D (NaCl 1. 5 % and glucose 6 % glucose). At first, the preference of fermented <b>anchovy</b> <b>fillets</b> with samples prepared in the form of pizza was assessed by applying a preference ranking test to 75 consumers. The results indicated the sample with 1 % NaCl and 6 % glucose as the preferred (P> 0. 05). Later in the second stage, the preferred fermented fillet was subjected to acceptance by 100 consumers who have the consumption habit of such product by using a hedonic scale of 9 points. The results indicated an acceptance rate of 79. 8 %. This work aimed to call attention to the importance of the acceptance of this food...|$|R
50|$|According to Larousse Gastronomique, rémoulade is 250 ml (1 cup) of {{mayonnaise}} with 2 tablespoons mixed herbs (parsley, chives, chervil and tarragon), 1 tablespoon drained capers, 2 {{finely diced}} cornichons {{and a few}} drops of anchovy essence (optional). Some recipes use chopped <b>anchovy</b> <b>fillets.</b> The rémoulade used in céleri-rave rémoulade {{is not the same as}} the remoulades discussed in this article, but is instead based on a simple mustard-flavoured vinegar and oil dressing spiced with salt, pepper, and chopped green herbs. Rémoulade is classified in French cooking as a derivative of the mayonnaise sauce.|$|R
50|$|Fresh <b>anchovy</b> <b>fillets,</b> which {{initially}} have a brown colored meat, are cleaned, de-scaled, and {{submerged in}} a bath {{of salt and}} water for 3 hours and vinegar for 6 hours in a cool place. The fillets slowly turn white as the vinegar reacts with the fish. Once having gone through this process, and the liquid has been drained, they are seasoned with minced garlic, olive oil and parsley. An alternative preparation is to submerge the fillets in a mixture 3:1 of vinegar and olive oil (it can be replaced by sunflower oil), already seasoned with garlic, parsley and salt, for two days. They are served cold with beer, rather than wine, since they already contain vinegar.|$|R
40|$|Marinated {{fish are}} fish {{products}} preserved by the combined action {{of salt and}} organic acids. The objective of this work was to analyze the variations in the chemical compounds of <b>anchovy</b> <b>fillets</b> that give them sensorial characteristics during the marinating process of Engraulis anchoita. The protein content decreased slightly and the TVB-N level decreased significantly in both the brining and marinating stages. In the marinating stage {{an increase in the}} total free aminoacids was observed. The NBV level in the brining and marinating solutions increased during these stages due to the solubilization of the non-protein nitrogenous compounds and the degradation of some protein compounds. The decrease of the contents of protein and TVB-N, and the increase of the acidity and the free aminoacids content during the marinating process give the marinated fillets the characteristic texture and aroma...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{thermodynamic}} properties of <b>anchovy</b> <b>fillets</b> and enzymatic modified pastes in two hydrolysis degrees (3 % HD and 14 % HD), at 50, 60 and 70 °C were evaluated. The GAB model {{was used to}} calculate the values of the monolayer moisture content and the {{thermodynamic properties}} of the samples. The enzymatic modification led to the increases of the superficial area and differential enthalpies, and decrease of the differential entropies in relation the samples in natura. The enthalpy–entropy compensation showed that the process was controlled by the enthalpy, it was only spontaneous for the samples in natura. Pore size decreased with enzymatic modification, and all samples were in the limit of region between micropores and mesopores (< 2 nm) for moisture content of 15 %, and mesopores (from 2 to 50 nm) to moisture content above 15 %...|$|R

50|$|Boquerones en vinagre are {{a type of}} appetizer or tapa {{found in}} Spain. The central {{ingredient}} of the dish is the boquerones, fresh <b>anchovies.</b> The <b>fillets</b> are marinated in vinegar or a mixture of vinegar and olive oil, and seasoned with garlic and parsley. It is commonly served with beer or soft drinks, and rarely with wine.|$|R
50|$|A {{traditional}} {{method of}} processing and preserving anchovies is to gut and salt them in brine, {{allow them to}} mature, and then pack them in oil or salt. This results in a characteristic strong flavor and the flesh turns deep grey. Pickled in vinegar, as with Spanish boquerones, anchovies are milder and the flesh retains a white color. In Roman times, anchovies were the base for the fermented fish sauce garum. Garum had a sufficiently long shelf life for long-distance commerce, and was produced in industrial quantities. Anchovies were also eaten raw as an aphrodisiac. Today, they are used in small quantities to flavor many dishes. Because of the strong flavor, they are also an ingredient in several sauces and condiments, including Worcestershire sauce, Caesar salad dressing, remoulade, Gentleman's Relish, many fish sauces, and in some versions of Café de Paris butter. For domestic use, <b>anchovy</b> <b>fillets</b> are packed in oil or salt in small tins or jars, sometimes rolled around capers. Anchovy paste is also available. Fishermen also use anchovies as bait for larger fish, such as tuna and sea bass.|$|R

40|$|Halotolerant or halophilic (Archaeabacteria) {{microorganisms}} can {{be found}} in salted and ripening fish products that are not affected by salt. They can be moderate or extremely halophilic bacteria. The extremely halophilic bacteria require between 15 - 30 % of NaCl for growth. The extremely halophilic archaeobacteria may be selectively isolated in different media. The aim of this work was to determine the effectiveness of the Salt-Agar-Milk medium, a medium modified in our laboratory through the addition of MgSO 4 and KCl - named SAMm, and its effect on the bacterial growth by means of comparison with other media, with and without milk, determining time of incubation and counting. Two samples of salted fish from local fish salting factories and two laboratory strains were used. The factory samples were matured <b>anchovy</b> and <b>anchovy</b> <b>fillets</b> in oil, and the laboratory strains were: Haloarcula spp. (proteolytic) and Halococcus spp. (non-proteolytic). The following media were alternatively used for the isolation of extremely halophilic bacteria: IRAM; Formulation of Gibbons and collaborators, Cod Milk agar, and SAMm. IRAM and Gibbons were also used enriched with milk. In the SAMm medium, there were obtained count values similar or higher than the ones of the traditional media; besides the simplicity of its elaboration, the possibility to obtain positive results two or three days earlier also added to its benefit. Consequently, it can be considered an alternative to the media traditionally used for the studied halophilic bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Anisakis simplex is a fish {{parasite}} that is {{a public}} health risk to those consuming raw or poorly cooked marine fish and cephalopods because {{of the possibility of}} becoming infested with live larvae. In humans, penetration of the larvae into the gastrointestinal track can cause acute and chronic symptoms and allergic anisakiasis. Excretion and secretion products released by the larvae are thought {{to play a role in}} migration through the tissues and induce an immunoglobulin E-mediated immune response. The aim of this preliminary study was to detect parasite antigens and allergens in fish tissues surrounding the migrating larvae. Hake and <b>anchovy</b> <b>fillets</b> were artificially parasitized with Anisakis larvae and stored in chilled conditions for 5 days. Larvae were evaluated for fluorescence, fish muscle tissue was examined with transmission electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical reactions of two rabbit polyclonal antisera against a parasite crude extract and the allergen Ani s 4 were recorded. Larvae immediately migrated into the fish muscle, and no emission of bluish fluorescence was observed. Fish muscle areas in contact with the parasite showed disruptions in the structure and inclusion of granules within sarcomeres. Both parasite antigens and the Ani s 4 allergen were located in areas close to the larvae and where sarcomere structure was preserved. These findings indicate that parasite antigens and allergens are dispersed into the muscle and might cause allergic symptoms such as dyspnea, vomiting, diarrhea, urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylaxis in some individuals sensitive to A. simplex.

40|$|In {{the last}} years {{a large number of}} {{different}} measurement methodologies were applied to measure the freshness of fishes. Among them the connection between freshness and headspace composition has been considered by gas chromatographic analysis and from the last two decades by a number of sensors and biosensors aimed at measuring some characteristic indicators (usually amines). More recently also the so-called artificial olfaction systems gathering together many non-specific sensors have shown a certain capability to transduce the global composition of the fish headspace capturing the differences between fresh and spoiled products. One of the main objectives related to the introduction of sensor systems with respect to the analytical methods is the claimed possibility to distribute the freshness control since sensors are expected to be "portable" and "simple". In spite of these objectives, until now sensor systems did not result in any tool that may be broadly distributed. In this paper, we present a chemical sensor array where the optical features of layers of chemicals, sensitive to volatile compounds typical of spoilage processes in fish, are interrogated by a very simple platform based on a computer screen and a web cam. An array of metalloporphyrins is here used to classify fillets of thawed fishes according to their storage days and to monitor the spoilage in <b>filleted</b> <b>anchovies</b> for a time of 8 h. Results indicate a complete identification of the storage days of thawed fillets and a determination of the storage time of anchovies held at room temperature with a root mean square error of validation of about 30 min. The optical system produces a sort of spectral fingerprint containing information about both the absorbance and the emission of the sensitive layer. The system here illustrated, based on computer peripherals, can be easily scaled to any device endowed with a programmable screen and a camera such as cellular phones offering {{for the first time the}} possibility to fulfil the sensor expectation of diffused and efficient analytical capabilities.
