60|$|He peered <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> at Falcone, and {{he swore}} in some surprise.|$|E
60|$|My wife looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> slowly withdrew {{her hands}} from my arm.|$|E
60|$|He looked first <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> at the carpet. He {{began to}} whistle softly.|$|E
6000|$|The {{landlord}} looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> again, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> {{with his}} former appearance of desperation, called down his stable-yard for [...] "Ikey!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A bit," [...] {{she replied}} slowly. [...] "And then he {{seemed as if}} he couldn't get <b>AT</b> <b>me,</b> really. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> he got brutal--he WAS brutal!" ...|$|R
6000|$|It struck <b>me</b> <b>at</b> the time, I remember, {{that the}} captain must have guessed my thoughts, for he glanced <b>at</b> <b>me</b> quickly, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> {{turning to the}} mate, with a sarcastic smile, said-- ...|$|R
60|$|In {{surprise}} {{she looked}} up <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> down at the pearls upon her satin slippers.|$|E
60|$|Then {{they all}} stared <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> they all {{stared at the}} ship lying at anchor.|$|E
60|$|Euphemia looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> {{the little}} pelican between us {{began to shake}} violently as we laughed.|$|E
60|$|Euphemia looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> an instant, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> {{her eyes}} filled with tears.|$|R
6000|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> pondered, <b>then</b> said, very slowly: [...] "No, as you say, {{there is}} no end to it. Nobody will ever know the end. Yet is it a true thing. I have seen it. It is life." ...|$|R
60|$|My wife looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in amazement, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> I {{detailed}} to her my troubles.|$|R
60|$|Hands thrust {{under his}} leathern belt, he looked fixedly <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> at the woman. Her eyes glittered glassily back at him.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know the}} name?" [...] said Mr. Jaggers, looking shrewdly <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> {{shutting}} up his eyes {{while he waited}} for my answer.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Mr. Spotkirk, {{this is an}} {{important}} business. I can't touch it under a hundred dollars.' He looked hard <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> he said:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He stoops over {{to brush}} the dust off his clothes, when {{out of his}} pocket drops a fine, nine-inch burglar's steel jimmy. He picks it up <b>and</b> looks <b>at</b> <b>me</b> sharp, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> grins <b>and</b> holds out his hand.|$|R
6000|$|When I {{came back}} he looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> carefully, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> said, [...] "You {{are not much}} the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, <b>and</b> rest awhile, <b>then</b> have much breakfast and come here to me." ...|$|R
60|$|The little lawyer glared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> a moment, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the belligerence faded {{out of his}} face.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> away, and her {{beautiful}} blue intelligent eyes told me plainly {{that she did}} not, and that she felt baffled and worried.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I was boiling {{the kettle}} when I fell asleep, sir.' He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> {{up at the}} still quivering bell with an ever-growing astonishment upon his face.|$|E
60|$|As the {{examination}} proceeded I cast {{a glance at}} Thurid and startled him looking wide-eyed and wonderingly <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> {{of a sudden he}} laughed full in my face.|$|E
6000|$|I see {{the ghost}} of a perished day; I know his face, and the feel of his dawn: 'Twas he who took me far away [...] To a spot strange <b>and</b> gray: Look <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> Day, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> pass on, But come again: yes, come anon! ...|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> long <b>and</b> curiously. <b>Then</b> {{he sighed}} <b>and</b> lit still another of my finest Havanas as he {{prepared}} to depart.|$|R
6000|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> a little, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> without resenting {{the freedom}} of my question--"The Countess Scarabelli, you mean," [...] he said.|$|R
60|$|He laughed for answer, with {{something}} of exultation in his voice. He swung {{me to his}} shoulder, and held me poised there, looking up <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> <b>then</b> he laughed again.|$|E
6000|$|... "A pretty wench you make, I {{swear by}} St. Valentine," [...] cried she, falling {{back to look}} <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> coming forward to pin up {{something}} about my coif, with her white fingers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, she was shocked, of course. She {{sat up in}} bed, staring <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> {{leaned back}} on the pillows again. I {{pretended not to notice}} it--but I was sorry I'd said {{anything}} about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|She stopped short, looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with wonder; <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> [...] "Nothing here is mine," [...] she {{answered}} in English, coldly and sadly.|$|R
6000|$|The {{young girl}} glanced <b>at</b> <b>me</b> a moment, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> with her charming smile, [...] "That's {{one of the}} {{consequences}} of a false position." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "One day a big, tall German {{army officer}} spotted <b>me</b> <b>and</b> kept staring <b>at</b> me...He {{followed}} <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> {{walked up to}} <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I thought, well, this is it." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{found him}} still inert in the {{greenhouse}} where I had first seen him. He did not move as I drew near him; he glanced <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> stared hard again at the flowerpots before him.|$|E
60|$|Way {{was made}} in the crowd, and the old gentleman pressed forward. When he got near, he smiled <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> {{proceeded}} to address to me a lengthy, but no doubt kindly meant, speech in Scandinavian.|$|E
60|$|We began breakfast. When we {{were about}} half-way through the meal, {{the door opened and}} de Cartienne appeared. He cast an {{apprehensive}} glance <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> seeing that Dr. Randall greeted him as usual, looked relieved.|$|E
60|$|We resumed our walk. Again we were {{nearing the}} inn. Lady Delahaye looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> every now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> curiously. My feeling towards her had grown {{more and more}} belligerent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wan," [...] I said gravely, [...] "I {{should like}} you to give me, for my own {{personal}} satisfaction, a translation of that Chinese sentence which my gifted countryman, the late godlike Webster, uttered upon a public occasion." [...] Wan Lee looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> intently, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the slightest possible twinkle crept into his black eyes. Then he replied with equal gravity,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with {{suspicion}} <b>and</b> <b>then</b> shook his head. I dared not press him with more questions; but after an interval he said plainly: [...] "She {{is not there}} now." ...|$|R
