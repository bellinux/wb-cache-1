5|$|At {{the end of}} December 1883, a {{humpback}} whale appeared in the Firth of Tay off Dundee, attracting much local interest. It was harpooned, but after an all-night struggle escaped. A week later it was found dead, and was towed on to the beach at Stonehaven, near Aberdeen. Struthers quickly visited the carcass, measuring it as 40 feet long with a tail 11 feet 4 inches wide. Struthers {{was not able to}} start dissecting it at once, as a local entrepreneur, John Woods, bought the whale <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his yard in Dundee, where on the first Sunday, 12,000 people paid to see it.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, Ljotić's {{body was}} removed from the tomb in which it was buried. Two {{theories}} exist about what happened to it. One claims it was removed by Ljotić's followers and taken to an unknown location following the creation of the Free Territory of Trieste in 1947. The other theory holds that Ljotić was buried in Šempeter pri Gorici until the signing of the Treaty of Osimo in 1977, when his followers removed his body from the tomb in which it was buried <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> an unknown location outside Yugoslavia, possibly to Italy.|$|E
5|$|In 1659, {{the war was}} {{characterized}} by Swedish forces defending their strongholds on the southern Baltic coast against allied assaults. A combined force of 17,000 Austrians and 13,000 Brandenburgers led by general Jean-Louis Raduit de Souches invaded Swedish Pomerania, took and burned Greifenhagen, took Wollin island and Damm, besieged Stettin and Greifswald without success, but took Demmin on 9 November. Counterattacks were mounted by general Müller von der Lühnen, who lifted the siege laid on Greifswald by the Brandenburgian prince elector, and major general Paul Wirtz, who from besieged Stettin managed to capture the Brandenburgian ammunition depot at Curau <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Stralsund. The Brandenburgians withdrew ravaging the countryside while retreating.|$|E

5|$|Migration of the Serbs was {{unveiled}} at the Archbishop's palace in Sremski Karlovci in 1896. It was kept there until 1941, when Ustaše fascists looted the palace and stole it, {{cut it out}} of its frame <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Zagreb, where it remained {{until the end of}} the war. After the war, the painting was returned to Serbia, briefly put on display at Belgrade's National Museum, and then given back to the Serbian Orthodox Church. It was ultimately put on display at the patriarchate building in Belgrade, where it remains. It began undergoing restoration in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Despite Turtle’s shortcomings, Bushnell’s {{invention}} marked {{an important}} milestone in submarine technology. The American inventor Robert Fulton conceived of his submarine Nautilus {{in the first}} years of the nineteenth century <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Europe when the United States proved largely uninterested in the design. During the American Civil War, the Confederate States of America, faced with a similar situation to that of the colonies during the War of Independence, developed an operational submarine CSS H.L. Hunley, whose destruction of the USS Housatonic in Charleston Harbor in February 1864 was the first successful submarine attack in history. By the early-twentieth century, the world’s navies were beginning to adopt submarines in larger numbers. Like Bushnell’s design, these boats mimicked the natural forms of marine animals the in their hull designs. As one contemporary historian of submarines observed in 1901, the evolution of modern submarine evolved from the whale, which he deemed a “submarine made by nature out of a mammal.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} the Grays returned, and Ann became {{suspicious}} when Burke would not let her approach a bed where she had left her stockings. When they were left {{alone in the house}} in the early evening, the Grays searched the straw and found Docherty's body, showing blood and saliva on the face. On their way to alert the police, they ran into McDougal who tried to bribe them with an offer of £10 a week; they refused. While the Grays reported the murder to the police, Burke and Hare removed the body <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Knox's surgery. The police search located Docherty's bloodstained clothing hidden under the bed. Burke and his wife gave different times for Docherty's departure from the house, which raised enough suspicion for the police to take them in for questioning. Early the following morning the police went to Knox's dissecting-rooms where they found Docherty's body; James Gray identified her as the woman he had seen with Burke and Hare. Hare and his wife were arrested that day, as was Broggan; all denied any knowledge of the events.|$|E

5|$|The {{police did}} not find the {{silencer}} in the cupboard. One of Bamber's cousins found it on 10 August, with {{what appeared to be}} flecks of red paint and blood, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> another of the cousin's homes; it took the police a further three days to collect it. A few days after that, it was the cousins who found a scratch on the red mantelpiece that the prosecution said was caused by the silencer during a struggle for the gun; that accounted for the fleck of red paint. The Bible found near Sheila was not examined at all. Journalist David Connett writes that a hacksaw blade that might have been used to gain entry to the house lay in the garden for months. Officers did not take contemporaneous notes; those who had dealt with Bamber wrote down their statements weeks later. The bodies were released days after the murders, and three of them (June, Nevill and Sheila) were cremated. Bamber's clothes were not examined until one month later. Ten years later all blood samples were destroyed.|$|E

25|$|It {{was to be}} a full {{generation}} before British archaeology {{caught up}} with the Danish.

After reviewing the Three-age System from Lucretius to Thomsen, Lubbock improved it <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> another level, that of cultural anthropology. Thomsen had been concerned with techniques of archaeological classification. Lubbock found correlations with the customs of savages and civilization.|$|E

Perdiccas and his troops followed him to Egypt, whereupon Ptolemy conspired with the satrap of Media, Peithon, and {{the commander of the}} Argyraspides, Antigenes, both serving as officers under Perdiccas, and assassinated him.

The city's seal shows Daniel Chester French's Minuteman statue, musket in hand, standing in the Santa Clara Valley, with the golden hills of Milpitas rising to the east. He faces defiantly south toward San Jose because early residents of Milpitas considered themselves as minutemen when they defeated efforts by San Jose to annex newly incorporated Milpitas.|$|E
25|$|The first soft {{ballistic}} vest, Myunjebaegab, {{was invented}} in Joseon Korea in the 1860s shortly after the French campaign against Korea (1866). Heungseon Daewongun ordered development of bullet-proof armor because of increasing threats from Western armies. Kim Gi-du and Gang Yun found that cotton could protect against bullets if thick enough, and devised bullet-proof vests made of 30 layers of cotton. The vests were used in battle during the United States expedition to Korea (1871), when the US Navy attacked Ganghwa Island in 1871. The US Army captured one of the vests <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the US, where it was stored at the Smithsonian Museum until 2007. The vest has since been sent back to Korea and is currently on display to the public.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} prohibits any {{publications that}} it feels will incite racial or religious disharmony, and has asked that religious matters not {{be discussed in}} public due to their sensitivity. It claims nobody has been arrested under the Internal Security Act for religious reasons. The government may demolish unregistered religious places of worship, and nongovernmental organisations have complained about the demolition of unregistered Hindu temples. These were often constructed on privately owned plantations prior to independence in 1957. After independence plantations became government property. In 2006 the state of Negeri Sembilan announced the demolition of a Hindu temple, although the temple sought injunction <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> court. State governments control mosques, appoint imams, and provide guidance for sermon content. The conflict between {{the federal and state}} governments over religious authority led to a slow pace of reform and development of laws relating to Islam. Other religious groups, such as the Malaysian Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism and Taoism (MCCBCHST), have supported political rallies.|$|E
