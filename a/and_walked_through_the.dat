500|$|On Sunday, 24 August 2008, {{film maker}} Nancy Kates {{set off a}} metal {{detector}} during security screening. She objected when the agent attempted to pat-down her breasts. She said she told the agent, [...] "'You can't treat me as a criminal for wearing a bra." [...] A TSA supervisor {{told her she had}} to either submit to the pat-down search in a private room or not fly. Kates offered to take off her bra, which the TSA accepted. She went to the restroom, removed her bra, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> airport and security screening braless. She said that a supervisor told her that underwire bras were the leading cause of metal detector false alarms.|$|E
500|$|The {{history of}} the Theatre was {{documented}} in an 8-minute, 26-second film by four local teenagers. The four were attending a screening of Fahrenheit 9/11 at the Theatre, during which {{a member of the}} audience announced that it was Fannie Cacchio's 93rd birthday. The teens, enrolled in a summer film camp, were seeking to create a documentary and decided to make the Theatre their subject. Filming took six weeks, wrapping around August 2004. In what a Daily Freeman reporter described as [...] "erhaps the most precious moment" [...] of the film, Fannie Cacchio got out of her son's car <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Theatre's doors, two weeks before her death. The documentary was shown in 2005, and again during the Theatre's 60th anniversary celebration in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|The {{eleventh}} {{match of}} the event was the encounter between The Undertaker and Kane. After Kane made his entrance, he was seen looking toward the entrance ramp saying, [...] "You're not coming back tonight. You're not coming back, I buried you alive." [...] After this, {{the lights in the}} arena went out and Paul Bearer, Undertaker's former manager and Kane's (storyline) father, was heard screaming [...] "oh yes!". Blue light began to fill the arena as Bearer, carrying the Undertaker's former trademark urn, led a group of Druids, all chanting and carrying torches, onto the entrance ramp. As the Druids made a formation {{at the top of the}} ramp, Bearer walked to ringside, turned and said to Kane, [...] "my son...you're no son of mine." [...] He then turned back to face the entryway and raised the urn to summon The Undertaker. As Kane continued to watch in the ring, refusing to believe his brother was back, Undertaker entered the arena in his [...] "Deadman" [...] persona, wearing a long black trenchcoat and hat, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Druid formation. Bearer met him at ringside and directed him to the ring steps, where Undertaker raised his arms to bring the arena lights back up. Before the match officially got underway, a now visibly shaken and distressed Kane began shouting at his brother repeatedly, saying things like [...] "I killed you!", [...] "I buried you alive!", and [...] "you're not real!", while Undertaker simply stood staring stoically at Kane. Eventually, Kane decided to see if Undertaker was indeed standing in front of him by slowly inching forward with his hand outstretched. Undertaker responded by punching Kane, knocking him down, and the match got underway. The two continued brawling until Kane delivered a Chokeslam to Undertaker, which he sat up from shortly afterward while Kane was taunting Paul Bearer. The Undertaker then retaliated with a Chokeslam and Tombstone piledriver to win the match and remaining undefeated at WrestleMania with a 12â€“0 record.|$|E
