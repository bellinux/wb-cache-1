50|$|As {{development}} of a new main battle tank stalled with problems and cost escalating quickly, the M60A1 was forced to serve longer than originally intended with production lasting over 20 years. In that time span numerous product improvement programs were put forward. The first of which was TLAC, for Top Loading Air Cleaner. This reduced dirt and dust ingestion, which increased engine life. Its top loading configuration also made it easier to service. Next came the AOS meaning Add-On Stabilization that was introduced in late 1972. As its name implies, this was an add on stabilizer kit made to fit with minimum modifications to the existing hydraulic gun control system. It was made up of several components: the rate sensor package, a control selector box, the electronics package, a shut-off valve, the traverse servo-valve assembly, the elevation servo-valve assembly, the handle shaping assembly, an hydraulic filter, and an <b>antibacklash</b> cylinder. At short to medium ranges, hit probabilities better than 50% from a moving M60A1 were obtained in Aberdeen test results while without a stabilizer it was essentially zero. M60A1(AOS) was the designation received by M60s equipped with the TLAC, AOS and the new T142 steel track, which had replaceable rubber pads and improved service life.|$|E
5000|$|Around {{the end of}} World War I, {{machine tool}} control {{advanced}} in various ways that {{laid the groundwork for}} later CNC technology. The jig borer popularized the ideas of coordinate dimensioning (dimensioning of all locations on the part from a single reference point); working routinely in [...] "tenths" [...] (ten-thousandths of an inch, 0.0001") as an everyday machine capability; and using the control to go straight from drawing to part, circumventing jig-making. In 1920 the new tracer design of J.C. Shaw was applied to Keller tracer milling machines for die-sinking via the three-dimensional copying of a template. This made diesinking faster and easier just as dies were in higher demand than ever before, and was very helpful for large steel dies such as those used to stamp sheets in automobile manufacturing. Such machines translated the tracer movements to input for servos that worked the machine leadscrews or hydraulics. They also spurred the development of <b>antibacklash</b> leadscrew nuts. All of the above concepts were new in the 1920s but became routine in the NC/CNC era. By the 1930s, incredibly large and advanced milling machines existed, such as the Cincinnati Hydro-Tel, that presaged today's CNC mills in every respect except for CNC control itself.|$|E
40|$|Torsional {{spring-loaded}} <b>antibacklash</b> gear {{which can}} improve the transmission precision is widely used in many precision transmission fields. It {{is very important to}} investigate the dynamic characteristics of <b>antibacklash</b> gear. In the paper, applied force analysis is completed in detail. Then, defining the starting point of double-gear meshing as initial position, according to the meshing characteristic of <b>antibacklash</b> gear, single- or double-tooth meshing states of two gear pairs and the transformation relationship at any moment are determined. Based on this, a nonlinear model of <b>antibacklash</b> gear with time-varying friction and meshing stiffness is proposed. The influences of friction and variations of torsional spring stiffness, damping ratio and preload on dynamic transmission error (DTE) are analyzed by numerical calculation and simulation, and the results show that <b>antibacklash</b> gear can increase the composite meshing stiffness; when the torsional spring stiffness is large enough, the oscillating components of the DTE (ODTE) and the RMS of the DTE (RDTE) trend to be a constant value; the variations of ODTE and RDTE are not significant, unless preload exceeds a certain value...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{was successfully}} utilized on a {{wind tunnel model}} tested in the transonic blow down tunnel. The mechanism is also applicable to a flying aircraft. Several interrelated mechanical subsystems were utilized, including a low inertia <b>antibacklash</b> drive mechanism for high frequency oscillation and a compact <b>antibacklash</b> drive mechanism for conversion of rotary motion to linear motion...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a new <b>antibacklash</b> gear {{mechanism}} design comprising three pinions and a rack is introduced. This mechanism offers several advantages compared to conventional <b>antibacklash</b> mechanisms, such as lower transmission error {{as well as}} lower required preload. Nonlinear dynamic modeling of this mechanism is developed to acquire insight into its dynamic behavior. It is observed {{that the amount of}} preload required to diminish the backlash depends on the applied input torque and nature of periodic mesh stiffness. Then, an attempt is made to obtain an approximate relation to find the minimum requiring preload to preserve the system's <b>antibacklash</b> property and reduce friction and wear on the gear teeth. The mesh stiffness of the mated gears, rack, and pinion is achieved via finite element method. Assuming that all teeth are rigid and static transmission error is negligible, dynamic transmission error (DTE) would be zero for every input torque, which is a unique trait, not yet proposed in previous research...|$|E
