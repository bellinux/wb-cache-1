5|$|As {{a reward}} for winning the ACC Championship, the Hokies {{received}} {{a position in the}} 2011 Orange Bowl, a Bowl Championship Series game. Virginia Tech's opponent in that game was the Stanford Cardinal, from the Pac-12 Conference. In that game, <b>a</b> <b>blowout</b> in favor of the Cardinal, Stanford defeated Virginia Tech 40–12. Florida State, meanwhile, was selected to participate in the 2010 Chick-fil-A Bowl against South Carolina. In that game, held New Year's Eve, the Seminoles defeated South Carolina, 26–17.|$|E

5|$|It took {{thirty minutes}} {{to clear the}} runway and rig an arresting cable and Armstrong telephoned Edwards and asked for someone to collect him. Milt Thompson was sent in an F-104B, the only {{two-seater}} available, but a plane Thompson had never flown. With great difficulty, Thompson made it to Nellis, but a strong crosswind caused a hard landing and the left main tire suffered <b>a</b> <b>blowout.</b> The runway was again closed to clear it, and Bill Dana was sent to Nellis in a T-33 Shooting Star, but he almost landed long—and the Nellis base operations office decided that to avoid any further problems, {{it would be best}} to find the three NASA pilots ground transport back to Edwards.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the keys}} to the game, {{according}} to ESPN.com blogger Matt Fortuna, was to stop the run. Both teams had 1,000+ yard rushers (Zach Line for SMU, Robbie Rouse for Fresno State), but SMU's rush defense (24th in FBS) was better than Fresno State's (73rd in FBS). Many analysts predicted that Fresno State would emerge victorious, some going as far as to predict <b>a</b> <b>blowout,</b> but said that for SMU to emerge victorious, they would have to win the field position battle as well as create turnovers.|$|E

The squad was captained by halfback Cornelius Billings. The year began with <b>a</b> <b>blowout</b> victory over St. John's College, but was followed by close losses to Johns Hopkins University and the Princeton Tigers reserves squad. The season continued a seven-season, eight game rivalry between the Naval Academy and Johns Hopkins, and began a ten-game, seven-year rivalry with St. John's.|$|E
5|$|The Air Force Falcons {{began the}} 2002 season having gone 6–6 during the {{previous}} season, and hoping to put that disappointing showing behind them.

5|$|The Huskies {{were unable}} to match their early success {{in the second half}} of the season, losing five of their next seven games. Everything went wrong for UConn in their game at North Carolina, as Frazer was intercepted three times and three Connecticut punts were blocked; North Carolina won in <b>a</b> <b>blowout,</b> 38–12. Against Big East rival Rutgers, UConn lost 12–10 as kicker Tony Ciaravino missed three field goals, {{including}} one with 1:09 left in the game that hit the right goalpost. The Huskies bounced back in their next game against eventual Big East champion Cincinnati, winning in <b>a</b> <b>blowout</b> 40–16. While not ranked in any of the polls, after the win Connecticut found itself No.25 in the BCS standings. The Huskies would promptly give up that honor, losing to West Virginia 35–13 after leading 10–0 at the end of the first quarter and 13–7 at halftime. UConn would win the next week at Big East bottom-dweller Syracuse, 39–14, as Lorenzen returned from his injury. This would prove to be their last win of the regular season, as the Huskies finished with losses to South Florida (17–13) and No.23-ranked Pittsburgh (34–10). Connecticut ended the regular season with a record of 7–5, 3–4 within the Big East conference.|$|E
5|$|The survivors' vehicle suffers <b>a</b> <b>blowout,</b> {{prompting}} them to swerve onto a farm. The {{back of the}} car is penetrated by PVC pipes which injure Eugene, and he is {{rushed to}} the hospital.

50|$|The {{relatively}} small distance, around 600 ft, between the Lusi mud volcano and the well being drilled by Lapindo (the Banjarpanji well) {{may not be}} a coincidence, as less than a day {{before the start of the}} mud flow the well suffered a kick. Their analysis suggests that the well has a low resistance to a kick. Similarly, a NE-SW crack in the surface in the drill site may be evidence of <b>an</b> underground <b>blowout.</b> The well may have suffered <b>an</b> underground <b>blowout</b> that resulted in a surface breach.|$|R

The second half, however, started out much differently, beginning with a 20–0 Lady Vols run. Tennessee led by as many as 35 points in the game, and ended the game with an 86–54 win. Catchings was named the SEC Player of the Week for her role in the DePaul and Vanderbilt games, scoring 35 and 22 points respectively. The final game of the month was the rematch with Georgia. It ended up being <b>a</b> <b>blowout.</b> Tennessee shot better than 60%, and Holdsclaw scored more points in the first half than the entire Georgia team.

5|$|Cleveland {{beat the}} Rockets 51–14 at home before {{a crowd of}} 60,457, the fourth time during the season that {{attendance}} at Cleveland Stadium surpassed 60,000 people. The Browns led from start to finish, and Lavelli and Speedie had two touchdown receptions each. Graham's four touchdown passes helped the Browns reach an AAFC scoring record. Bud Schwenk made his first appearance {{in the fourth quarter}} of the game, substituting for Graham as the game turned into <b>a</b> <b>blowout.</b> He threw for a fifth touchdown, a 20-yard pass to Bill Lund. Edgar Jones added to Cleveland's scoring with a touchdown run in the first quarter, and center Frank Gatski scored the team's final touchdown in the fourth quarter after intercepting a pass and running it back 36 yards. It was the only touchdown of Gatski's 12-year career. Groza made a 51-yard field goal, the longest of the year in either the National Football League or AAFC, and kicked through six of the team's seven extra points. The seventh extra point was blocked, only the second time he missed a conversion in 33 tries.

5|$|Rolle {{was forced}} to redshirt the 2007–08 season due to {{transfer}} rules.

5|$|Vick {{started out}} well, winning {{his first game}} against the Redskins and {{throwing}} had his first career 400 yard game in a close loss to the Chargers, with 4 passing TDs, 2 rushing TDs, and no interceptions in the two game stretch. After that, Vick suffered losses against Kansas City and Denver, where he threw for 1 touchdown and 3 INTs in that stretch (all 3 were thrown against Kansas City). In {{a game against the}} Giants, Vick was 6–14 for 105 yards, when he suffered a hamstring injury. Nick Foles played stellar in his place, going 8–2 as starter, while throwing 27 touchdowns to only 2 interceptions with a 119.0 passer rating. Vick saw his only playing time in a 15–7 loss to the Giants, where he was 6–9 for 30 yards and an interception, but he again suffered an injury, this time to his quadriceps, and was replaced by rookie Matt Barkley, who played even worse.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionCarotid <b>blowout</b> {{syndrome}} is <b>an</b> uncommon complication for patient treated by {{head and neck}} tumours, related with a high mortality rate. ObjectiveThe {{aim of this study}} was to study the risk of carotid <b>blowout</b> in <b>a</b> large cohort of patients treated only by larynx cancer. MethodsRetrospective analysis of patients older than 18 years, treated by larynx cancer who developed <b>a</b> carotid <b>blowout</b> syndrome in <b>a</b> tertiary academic centre. Results 197 patients met the inclusion criteria, 192 (98. 4 %) were male and 5 (1. 6 %) were female. 6 (3 %) patients developed <b>a</b> carotid <b>blowout</b> syndrome, 4 patients had <b>a</b> carotid <b>blowout</b> syndrome located in the internal carotid artery and 2 in the common carotid artery. According to the type of rupture, 3 patients suffer a type I, 2 patients a type III and 1 patient a type II. Five of those patients had previously undergone radiotherapy and all patients underwent total laryngectomy. We found a statistical correlation between open surgical procedures (p= 0. 004) and radiotherapy (p= 0. 023) and the development of <b>a</b> carotid <b>blowout</b> syndrome. ConclusionCarotid <b>blowout</b> {{syndrome is}} <b>an</b> uncommon complication in patients treated by larynx tumours. According to our results, patient underwent radiotherapy and patients treated with open surgical procedures with pharyngeal opening have a major risk to develop this kind of complication...|$|R
