5|$|All Saints' Church, Shuart , in the north-west of the Isle of Thanet, Kent, in the {{south-east}} of England, {{was established}} in the Anglo-Saxon period as a chapel of ease for the parish of St Mary's Church, Reculver, which was centred on the north-eastern corner of mainland Kent, adjacent to the island. The Isle of Thanet was then separated from the mainland by the sea, which formed a strait known as the Wantsum Channel. The last church on the site was demolished by the early 17th century, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> remaining above ground to show that a church once stood there.|$|E

Wumpa Island, hosting a large tree, has been long {{abandoned}} <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> more than a jungle, a lizard-infested city, dilapidated bridges high in the mountains, and the ruins of an ancient temple. However, having discovered that Crash is making {{his way across the}} islands, Cortex dispatches the deranged Ripper Roo on the island in a temple {{at the start of a}} creek. Crash manages to cross the river and, after avoiding contact with his razor-sharp toenails, knocks Ripper Roo out cold beside a waterfall, and successfully makes his way through the city and the temples. Crash also defeats another of Cortex's mutants, the muscular Koala Kong, in a volcanic cave mine before finally crossing to the Cortex Island. Crash then navigates the Cortex Power station, a huge power plant that provides Cortex's castle with energy while polluting the nearby area. When he reaches the factory core, Crash battles and defeats the CEO of Cortex Power, Pinstripe Potoroo, damaging the power plant.|$|E
25|$|Study and Core Area {{boundaries}} {{delineate the}} historical extents of a battlefield. POTNR boundaries delineate areas within the Study and Core Area(s) that still retain integrity and {{remain to be}} preserved. The Study and Core Area boundaries define the historic landscape of the battlefield while areas that retain integrity define the modern landscape. For example, if a particular farm field was important during the battle but now is covered by a housing development, {{it would still be}} included in a Core or Study Area boundary because the farm field informs the history of the battle. That same farm field, however, would not be considered for inclusion in an POTNR boundary because it no longer has integrity (i.e. conveys a sense of the historic scene) <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> left of the original farm field to preserve.|$|E

25|$|The Court of Appeal only hears appeals from {{decisions}} of the High Court made when the latter is exercising original criminal jurisdiction. In other words, matters heard by the High Court on appeal from the State Courts cannot be further appealed to the Court of Appeal, though questions of law may be reserved for determination by the Court (see below). A person convicted in the High Court can appeal against the conviction, the sentence or both, unless he or she pleaded guilty in which case only an appeal against the extent or legality of the sentence is permitted. In the latter situation, the Court of Appeal may nonetheless permit the person who pleaded guilty to appeal against conviction if it believes that {{this is in the}} interests of justice. The Public Prosecutor may appeal against an acquittal or the sentence imposed on an accused person. The Court is entitled to summarily reject an appeal if the grounds of appeal do not involve any question of law, the conviction is supportable by the evidence, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> in the circumstances of the case which raises a reasonable doubt as to whether the conviction was right or leads the Court to think the sentence should be reduced. The summary rejection of an appeal may only be done upon the unanimous decision of the Judges of Appeal.|$|E

John Macky thought him [...] "of a familiar, easy {{disposition}} with a good sound understanding but modest in showing it... very fat, loves news, his bottle & the Queen." [...] In making fun of George's asthma, Lord Mulgrave said the Prince was forced to breathe hard in case people mistook him for dead and buried him. By the time of Queen Victoria, George {{had a reputation as}} a dullard, and was the target of disdain. Victoria hoped her own husband, Prince Albert, would never fill the [...] "subordinate part played by the very stupid and insignificant husband of Queen Anne".

Although a poll (conducted by Bollywood Hungama) named it the most anticipated release of the year, the film underperformed {{at the box office}} grossing [...] in India. After providing her voice for the character of Laila, the love interest of a street dog named Romeo, in the Yash Raj Films and Walt Disney Pictures animated film Roadside Romeo, Kapoor played a mistrustful wife who believed her husband was unfaithful in Rohit Shetty's comedy Golmaal Returns. A sequel to the 2006 film , the film had an ambivalent reception from critics, and Kapoor received mixed reviews. The Indian Express believed the screenplay was derivative, concluding: [...] "There is nothing particularly new about a suspicious wife keeping tabs on her husband, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> particularly new in the way Kareena plays it."

500|$|Professor David Harman {{observed}} that Swaminarayan [...] "criticized the popular shakta cults and 'gosai' and 'nath' ascetics for the contemptuous and instrumental {{way in which}} they viewed and treated women. These cults were often responsible for gross sexual abuse of women." [...] Hardiman added that Swaminarayan's view towards women was not in line with this type of misogyny and was rooted in his desire to protect the ill treatment of women along with promoting celibacy for ascetics. Swaminarayan [...] "forbade all sadhus and sadhvis (that is, male and female ascetics) of his sect from having any contact whatsoever with members of the opposite sex." [...] This strict precept was one he likely internalized [...] "after travelling as an ascetic throughout India [...] he was reported to vomit if approached by even the shadow of a woman". To help his male ascetic followers maintain their vow of celibacy, Swaminarayan taught “the woman who attracts attention is made up of bones, blood vessels, spittle, blood, mucus and feces; she is simply a collection of these things, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> to be attractive.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "instructions" [...] or [...] "teaching" [...] genre, {{as well as}} {{the genre}} of [...] "reflective discourses", can be grouped in the larger corpus of wisdom {{literature}} found in the ancient Near East. The genre is didactic in nature and is thought to have formed part of the Middle Kingdom scribal education syllabus. However, teaching texts often incorporate narrative elements that can instruct as well as entertain. Parkinson asserts that there is evidence that teaching texts were not created primarily for use in scribal education, but for ideological purposes. For example, Adolf Erman (1854–1937) writes that the fictional instruction given by Amenemhat I (r. 1991–1962 BC) to his sons [...] "...far exceeds the bounds of school philosophy, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> whatever to do with school in a great warning his children to be loyal to the king". While narrative literature, embodied in works such as The Eloquent Peasant, emphasize the individual hero who challenges society and its accepted ideologies, the teaching texts instead stress the need to comply with society's accepted dogmas.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene that}} {{corresponds}} with [...] "You Can't Win" [...] in The Wiz begins with Dorothy Gale (played by Diana Ross), stumbling upon a scarecrow being heckled by crows while {{stuck in the}} air on a pole. Dorothy remains hidden while the crows mock Scarecrow for asking to be let down. They state that he will remain on the pole because that is his role <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> to get down for. The crows tell Scarecrow {{that even if he}} was let down, {{he would not be able}} to walk as he is a [...] "straw paper dummy". Scarecrow tries to reason with the birds by reading relevant quotations from figures such as Francis Bacon and Cicero as a rationale to be freed. The crows do not relent, however, and make him recite their [...] "Crow Commandments": [...] "Thou shall honor all crows", [...] "Thou shall stop reading all bits of paper and literature" [...] and [...] "Thou shall never, never get down off of this here pole". In addition, the birds tell Scarecrow to sing the crow anthem, [...] "You Can't Win". After the song concludes, Dorothy comes out of hiding and releases Scarecrow from the pole. Together, they then dance their way down the yellow brick road in search of The Wiz, singing [...] "Ease on Down the Road" [...] as they go.|$|E
500|$|Bede's account {{indicates}} that Cædmon {{was responsible for}} the composition of a large [...] of vernacular religious poetry. In contrast to Saints Aldhelm and Dunstan, Cædmon's poetry {{is said to have been}} exclusively religious. Bede reports that Cædmon [...] "could never compose any foolish or trivial poem, but only those which were concerned with devotion", and his list of Cædmon's output includes work on religious subjects only: accounts of creation, translations from the Old and New Testaments, and songs about the [...] "terrors of future judgment, horrors of hell, … joys of the heavenly kingdom, … and divine mercies and judgments." [...] Of this corpus, only his first poem survives. While vernacular poems matching Bede's description of several of Cædmon's later works are found in London, British Library, Junius 11 (traditionally referred to as the [...] "Junius" [...] or [...] "Cædmon" [...] manuscript), the older traditional attribution of these texts to Cædmon or Cædmon's influence cannot stand. The poems show significant stylistic differences both internally and with Cædmon's original Hymn, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> about their order or content to suggest that they could not have been composed and anthologised without any influence from Bede's discussion of Cædmon's oeuvre: the first three Junius poems are in their biblical order and, while Christ and Satan could be understood as partially fitting Bede's description of Cædmon's work on future judgment, pains of hell and joys of the heavenly kingdom, the match is not exact enough to preclude independent composition. As Fritz and Day have shown, indeed, Bede's list itself may owe less to direct knowledge of Cædmon's actual output than to traditional ideas about the subjects fit for Christian poetry or the order of the catechism. [...] Similar influences may, of course, also have affected the makeup of the Junius volume.|$|E
