When it finally did, the justices suggested they would clarify {{once and for}} all the extent to which opinions could be expressed without fear of being held libellous. The actual decision, however, was regarded as having confused the issue somewhat instead. Several state courts have responded by recognizing an opinion privilege in some way in their own jurisprudence.|$|E

He was never happy with the position and resigned {{as chairman of the}} RDB after a year, but remained on the oversight committee. He continued to be skeptical about rockets and missiles, writing in his 1949 book, Modern Arms and Free Men, that intercontinental ballistic missiles would not be technically feasible [...] "for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come...</b> if ever".|$|E

500|$|Betty was the longest-serving barmaid of the soap's public house, The Rovers Return. She first served {{behind the}} bar in 1969 and had been shown to work there for 42 years, as of 2011. There have been brief breaks however, as storylines {{have led to the}} {{character}} being fired or quitting her post. She was fired by Annie Walker (Doris Speed), who accused her of theft, and she quit her post in 1995 when Jack (Bill Tarmey) and Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn) took over as landlords. In the summer of 2009, Betty was sacked again temporarily by manager Poppy Morales. A Coronation Street insider reassured The Sun that Betty was not being written out of the show, however, stating: [...] "She’ll be here for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> – she’ll just be {{on the other side of}} the bar for a change". In a storyline that aired in February 2010, Betty – at 90 years old – was named Manchester's Oldest Barmaid. In a plot twist, a 91-year-old rival came forward, resulting in Betty fearing she killed her, when the rival consumes a two-month-old hotpot.|$|E
500|$|On October 31, 2011, Gaga {{performed}} a Bollywood version of [...] "Marry the Night" [...] in India during a Formula One after party in Greater Noida. Before the performance, she announced [...] "I feel like I've waited <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> here. And I feel very grateful.... For {{the first time}} ever, I'm going to sing 'Marry the Night'." [...] She sat on the piano and played a slow version of the song, accompanied by a sitar. At the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards, Gaga gave her first televised performance of [...] "Marry the Night" [...] dressed as a satellite landing on the moon. Wearing a red bikini, and a large red disc around her, Gaga was perched atop a semi-circular replica of the moon which was covered in silver chains. Flames erupted around the stage as Gaga revealed another circular disc covering her face. She sang the song from that vantage point and {{near the end of}} the performance, removed the metal disc and {{performed a}} choreographed dance routine with her back-up dancers. She also performed the song at the 2011 Bambi Awards in Wiesbaden, Germany, on November 10. The stage included a vintage convertible with a keyboard built into the side of the door and Gaga also won an award later that night at the gala.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{produced}} by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had served as showrunners of seasons three and four. They returned to the show to produce this and several other episodes while under contract with The Walt Disney Company. The episode was written by Reid Harrison and directed by Steven Dean Moore. It {{had one of the}} longest episode gaps between its conception to the time it was finished. The idea was first conceived at a story retreat. Jean found a copy of TV Guide while in the bathroom, with The X-Files on the cover. Feeling a crossover would be a good idea, he came back into the room, told Reiss his idea, and the pair pitched it. None of the other staff wanted to do it, so Reiss and Jean decided to do it themselves. Before the episode was produced, the script was sent to Chris Carter, the creator of The X-Files, who said that it was an [...] "honor" [...] to be satirized by The Simpsons. Jean was worried that the episode was not funny, as at the table reading {{there were only a few}} of the writers present and as such, the script got no laughs at all. It took <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up with an ending, and an explanation for the alien. Originally, it was just going to be left as a mystery. Mulder and Scully's office was designed to be exactly the same as the one used in The X-Files. After it had been finished, Fox sent the episode out for a critical review, which was [...] "really great". The scene with the [...] "Homer is a dope" [...] T-shirts originally had an extra line: [...] "I told you, we're sold out!", thus filling in the plot error in the actual episode in which Homer asks for some T-shirts, despite just being told that they were sold out. The scene after Homer's first encounter with the alien, in which he runs through a field writing [...] "Yahhh!" [...] in the grass, was written by David M. Stern, and added in after the original read through.|$|E

2500|$|Outrages {{upon the}} former {{slaves in the}} South there were in plenty. Their sufferings were many. But white men, too, were victims of lawless violence, and in all {{portions}} of the North and the late [...] "rebel" [...] states. Not a political campaign passed without the exchange of bullets, the breaking of skulls with sticks and stones, the firing of rival club-houses. Republican clubs marched the streets of Philadelphia, amid revolver shots and brickbats, to save the negroes from the [...] "rebel" [...] savages in Alabama... The project to make voters out of black men {{was not so much}} for their social elevation as for the further punishment of the Southern white people—for the capture of offices for Radical scamps and the entrenchment of the Radical party in power for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in the South and in the country at large.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his first}} term of office, from 1921 to 1926, King pursued a {{conservative}} domestic policy with the object of lowering wartime taxes and, especially, wartime ethnic and labour tensions. [...] "The War is over", he argued, [...] "and for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{it is going to}} take all that the energies of man can do to bridge the chasm and heal the wounds which the War has made in our social life." [...] He sought a Canadian voice independent of London in foreign affairs. In September 1922 the British Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, appealed repeatedly to King for Canadian support in the Chanak crisis, in which a war threatened between Britain and Turkey. King coldly replied that the Canadian Parliament would decide what policy to follow, making clear it would not be bound by London's suggestions; the crisis soon dissipated, but the episode led to the downfall of Lloyd George.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to the threatened loss of the Twins, the Minnesota private and public sector negotiated and approved a financing package for a replacement stadium— a baseball-only outdoor, natural turf ballpark in the Warehouse District of downtown Minneapolis— owned by a new entity known as the Minnesota Ballpark Authority. [...] Target Field was constructed {{at a cost of}} $544.4million (including site acquisition and infrastructure), utilizing the proceeds of a $392million public bond offering based on a 0.15% sales tax in Hennepin County and private financing of $185million provided by the Pohlad family. [...] As part of the deal, the Twins also signed a 30-year lease of the new stadium, effectively guaranteeing the continuation of the team in Minnesota for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> Construction of the new field began in 2007, and was completed in December 2009, in time for the 2010 season. Commissioner Bud Selig, who earlier had threatened to disband the team, observed that without the new stadium the Twins could not have committed to sign their star player, catcher Joe Mauer, to an 8-year, $184million contract extension. The first regular season game in Target Field was played against the Boston Red Sox on April 12, 2010, with Mauer driving in two runs and going 3-for-5 to help the Twins defeat the Red Sox, 5–2.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "socialism with Chinese characteristics" [...] {{was added}} to the General Program of the party's {{constitution}} at the 12th National Congress, without a definition of the term. At the 13th National Congress, held in 1987, Zhao Ziyang, the CPC General Secretary, claimed that socialism with Chinese characteristics was the [...] "integration of the fundamental tenets of Marxism with the modernization drive in China" [...] and was [...] "scientific socialism rooted in the realities of present-day China". By this time the CPC believed that China was in the primary stage of socialism, and therefore needed market relations to develop into a socialist society. Two years earlier, Su had tried to internationalize the term [...] "primary stage of socialism" [...] by claiming that socialism contained three different production phases. China was currently in the first phase, while the Soviet Union and the remaining Eastern Bloc countries were in the second phase. Because China was in the primary stage of socialism, Zhao argued that in [...] " [...] for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> we shall develop various sectors of the economy, always ensuring the dominant position of the public sector". Further, some individuals should be allowed to become rich [...] "before the objective of common prosperity [...] is achieved". Lastly, during the primary stage of socialism, planning would no longer be the primary means of organization of the economy. Upon hearing this remark, Chen Yun, a cautious reformer and the second-most powerful politician in China, walked out of the meeting.|$|E
