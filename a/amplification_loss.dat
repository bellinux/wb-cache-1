Each network connects two communicating parties (Alice and Bob) over two transmission channels. In previous work we have shown that a dual-NOPA coherent feedback network generates better Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entanglement (i. e., more two-mode squeezing) between its two outgoing Gaussian fields than a single NOPA, when the same total pump power is consumed and the systems undergo the same transmission losses over the same distance. This paper aims to analyze stability, EPR entanglement between two outgoing fields of interest, and bipartite entanglement of two-mode Gaussian states of cavity modes of the $N$-NOPA networks under the effect of transmission and <b>amplification</b> <b>losses,</b> as well as time delays.

Favorable tumors usually have near-triploid karyotypes with few structural rearrangements. Aggressive stage 4 tumors often have near-diploid or near-tetraploid karyotypes and structural rearrangements. Whole genome approaches for analysis of genome-wide copy number {{have been used to}} analyze chromosomal abnormalities in tumor samples. We have used array-based copy number analysis using oligonucleotide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) arrays to analyze the chromosomal structure {{of a large number of}} neuroblastoma tumors of different clinical and biological subsets. Results Ninety-two neuroblastoma tumors were analyzed with 50 K and/or 250 K SNP arrays from Affymetrix, using CNAG 3. 0 software. Thirty percent of the tumors harbored 1 p deletion, 22 % deletion of 11 q, 26 % had MYCN amplification and 45 % 17 q gain. Most of the tumors with 1 p deletion were found among those with MYCN <b>amplification.</b> <b>Loss</b> of 11 q was most commonly seen in tumors without MYCN amplification. In the case of MYCN amplification, two types were identified. One type displayed simple continuous amplicons; the other type harbored more complex rearrangements. MYCN was the only common gene in all cases with amplification. Complex amplification on chromosome 12 was detected in two tumors and three different overlapping regions of amplification were identified. Two regions with homozygous deletions, four cases with CDKN 2 A deletions in 9 p and one case with deletion on 3 p (the gene RBMS 3) were also detected in the tumors.

Usually there is an unbalanced translocation breakpoint in 8 p 12 (29. 7 Mb – 38. 5 Mb) with loss of distal 8 p, sometimes with proximal amplification of 8 p 11 - 12. Rearrangements in 8 p 11 - 12 have been investigated using high-resolution array CGH, but the first 30 Mb of 8 p are less well characterised, although this region contains several proposed tumour suppressor genes. Methods We analysed the whole of 8 p by array CGH at tiling-path BAC resolution in 32 breast and six pancreatic cancer cell lines. Regions of recurrent rearrangement distal to 8 p 12 were further characterised, using regional fosmid arrays. FISH, and quantitative RT-PCR on over 60 breast tumours validated the existence of similar events in primary material. Results We confirmed that 8 p is usually lost up to at least 30 Mb, but a few lines showed focal loss or copy number steps within this region. Three regions showed rearrangements common to at least two cases: two regions of recurrent loss and one region of <b>amplification.</b> <b>Loss</b> within 8 p 23. 3 (0 Mb – 2. 2 Mb) was found in six cell lines. Of the genes always affected, ARHGEF 10 showed a point mutation of the remaining normal copies in the DU 4475 cell line. Deletions within 12. 7 Mb – 19. 1 Mb in 8 p 22, in two cases, affected TUSC 3.

By this way the Josephson junction acts as the pump oscillator as well as the time varying reactance of the parametric amplifier. In quantum-limited <b>amplification,</b> <b>losses</b> and noise have an increased impact on the characteristics of an amplifier.

Thus, we derive a quantum mechanical model of the lossy DCPJPA. Thermal losses are modeled by the quantum Langevin approach, by coupling the quantized system to a photon heat bath in thermodynamic equilibrium. The mode occupation in the bath follows the Bose-Einstein statistics. Based on the second quantization formalism, we derive the Heisenberg equations of motion of both resonator modes.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the {{clinical}} outcome of anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors is variable, but also that the histological diagnosis is subject to interobserver variation. We investigated whether the assessment of 1 p/ 19 q codeletion, polysomy of chromosome 7, epider mal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene <b>amplification</b> (EGFRamp), and <b>loss</b> of chromosome 10 or 10 q offers Molecular analysis of anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors in a prospective randomized study...|$|R
40|$|Gene <b>amplification</b> and allele <b>loss</b> {{occur in}} a variety of human tumours and some have {{prognostic}} value. Therefore, techniques which facilitate detection and quantification of gene dosage could have wide applicability in cancer research. Using the INT- 2 gene as a model system, a quantitative procedure has been developed for measuring gene copy number using dual-label hybridization to DNA dot blots. A probe specific for the INT- 2 gene was labelled with [alpha- 32 P]dCTP and a probe to beta-actin, the control locus, was labelled with [alpha- 35 S]dATP. Flat-bed scintillation counting was used to detect and separate the emissions resulting from each bound probe, and gene dosage was calculated from the ratio of INT- 2 to the beta-actin probe compared with the ratio derived from constitutional DNA. Calculated ratios of greater than 1. 22 and less than 0. 78 indicated gene <b>amplification</b> and allelic <b>loss</b> respectively, at the 99 % confidence limit derived from the population of 35 constitutional DNAs. The results were validated by RFLP analysis. It is expected that this technique will permit precise gene dosage quantification in many areas...|$|R
40|$|Laser cooling and {{amplification}} {{of mechanical}} modes in an optical cavity are now possible with several device geometries. Quantum back action sets the fundamental limit to cooling. It has, however, not been {{considered in the}} regenerative oscillator, wherein mechanical <b>amplification</b> overcomes <b>loss,</b> leading to self-sustained, coherent oscillations at rf and microwave rates. In these devices, the spectral purity, {{as measured by the}} phase noise, has a back-action contribution that is herein derived and evaluated in recently characterized systems. Beyond its importance as a fundamental stability limit, it can provide a way to observe quantum back action within the context of cavity optomechanics. The analysis is also applied to the case of cooling, and a pump contribution to the cooling limit is derived...|$|R
2500|$|As {{in other}} lasers, the gain region is {{surrounded}} with an optical cavity {{to form a}} laser. In the simplest form of laser diode, an optical waveguide is made on that crystal's surface, such that the light is confined to a relatively narrow line. The two ends of the crystal are cleaved to form perfectly smooth, parallel edges, forming a Fabry–Pérot resonator. Photons emitted into a mode of the waveguide will travel along the waveguide and be reflected several times from each end face before they exit. As a light wave passes through the cavity, it is amplified by stimulated emission, but light is also lost due to absorption and by incomplete reflection from the end facets. Finally, if there is more <b>amplification</b> than <b>loss,</b> the diode begins to [...] "lase".|$|R
40|$|Genomic {{instability}} frequently {{results in}} changes in gene expression or altered regulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Research into the tumorigenic {{impact of these}} genes {{has led to the}} current acceptance of many of these genes as drivers of tumorigenesis. In the past decade, studies of small, non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), have gained notice in the cancer research field. As miRNAs are often found in intragenic locations, it is likely that gene <b>amplification</b> and <b>loss</b> events such as those which disrupt known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, may also affect miRNAs. We recently reported that MIR- 491, located just distal to the CDKN 2 A locus, is frequently co-deleted with CDKN 2 A [1]. As the CDKN 2 A locus encodes two well-studied and commonly altered tumor suppressors (p 16 INK 4 A an...|$|R
