He {{worked with the}} Jazz Foundation of America to help many American jazz <b>and</b> <b>blues</b> musicians in need. He wrote many articles {{to draw attention to}} the plight of America's pioneering jazz <b>and</b> <b>blues</b> musicians, which were published in the Wall Street Journal and the Village Voice.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the very}} {{different}} circumstances from which they came, and in which they played, the rhythm <b>and</b> <b>blues</b> produced by British artists was very different in tone from that created by African Americans, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. They have been criticised for exploiting the massive catalogue of African American music, {{but it has also}} been noted that they both popularised that music, bringing it to British, world and in some cases American audiences, and helping to build the reputation of existing and past rhythm <b>and</b> <b>blues</b> artists. In order to sustain their careers most British R artists soon moved on from recording and performing American standards to writing and recording their own music. Many from the 60s helped pioneer psychedelic, and eventually progressive, hard rock and heavy metal, mixing in elements of world, folk and classical music. Others from the 1970s and 1980s, helped shape new wave and post-punk music and had a major impact on later genres, including Britpop. As a result, British rhythm <b>and</b> <b>blues</b> has been a major component of the sound of rock music.|$|E
5|$|British rhythm <b>and</b> <b>blues</b> {{differed}} in tone {{from that of}} African American artists, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. British rhythm <b>and</b> <b>blues</b> singers were criticised for their emulation of rhythm <b>and</b> <b>blues</b> vocal styles, with shouts, glottal stops, moans and cries. However, vocalists such as Van Morrison, Mick Jagger, Eric Burdon and Steve Winwood {{did not attempt to}} emulate a particular singer and were seen by critics as able to sing the blues convincingly and with some power. In cover versions of R songs, riffs were often simplified or used less frequently. The object of the music was usually to whip up energy, rather than to produce musical finesse. Many groups were based around guitars (rhythm, lead and bass) and drums and as a result arrangements tended to be guitar-oriented and at higher tempos than the originals. Amplification of guitars to the highest levels of underpowered amplifiers created the over-driven guitar sound that would become characteristic of rock music.|$|E

5|$|British trad jazz band-leader Chris Barber {{was one of}} {{the major}} figures in the {{development}} and popularisation of rhythm <b>and</b> <b>blues</b> in Britain the 1950s. His interest in the blues would help foster both the skiffle craze and the development of electric rhythm <b>and</b> <b>blues,</b> as members of his dance band would be fundamental to both movements. He founded the National Jazz League partly as a means of popularising the blues, served as co-director of the National Jazz Federation and helped establish the Marquee Club, which would become one of the major venues for British R bands. He also brought over American folk <b>and</b> <b>blues</b> performers who found they were much better known and paid in Europe than America, a series of tours that began with Josh White and Big Bill Broonzy in 1951, and would include Brownie McGhee, Sonny Terry, Memphis Slim, Muddy Waters and Lonnie Johnson.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{the term}} rhythm <b>and</b> <b>blues</b> had no longer been in wide use; instead, terms like soul music {{were used to}} {{describe}} popular music by black artists. In the 1980s, however, rhythm <b>and</b> <b>blues</b> came back into use, most often {{in the form of}} R, a usage that has continued to the present. Contemporary R arose when sultry funk singers like Prince became very popular, alongside dance-oriented pop stars like Michael Jackson and Madonna.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, Dave Kelly, who {{had been}} a member of the John Dummer Blues Band formed The Blues Band with ex-Manfred Mann vocalist Paul Jones and Gary Fletcher, who {{continued}} to tour and record rhythm <b>and</b> <b>blues</b> into the new millennium. Roots music, including rhythm <b>and</b> <b>blues,</b> began to enjoy another resurgence of interest towards the end of the 1980s and in the 1990s. Annual blues festivals were established, including The Great British Rhythm <b>and</b> <b>Blues</b> Festival, held at Colne in Lancashire from 1989, which hosts both US and British R acts. In 1994 Jools Holland, former keyboard player with Squeeze and presenter of the highly influential TV show Later..., reshaped his backing band as Jools Holland's Rhythm <b>and</b> <b>Blues</b> Orchestra and, as well as supporting him on the show, they embarked on a series of tours. After leaving the Rolling Stones in 1997 Bill Wyman formed the Rhythm Kings, which featured guitarists Peter Frampton and Albert Lee as well former Procol Harum keyboardist Gary Brooker, touring and producing a series of R based albums. By 2000 the fanzine Blues Matters! had managed to become a regular glossy magazine.|$|E

5|$|Stone Rollin expands on the {{traditional}} soul music style of his 2008 album The Way I See It, with exploring rhythm <b>and</b> <b>blues,</b> rock, funk, <b>and</b> <b>blues</b> styles. A widespread critical success and deemed by some reviewers as Saadiq's best work, the record was noted for its stylistic breadth, groove-based compositions, varied subject matter, and incorporation of the Mellotron keyboard. It also became Saadiq's highest-charting album in the United States, reaching number 14 on the Billboard 200. He supported the album with a concert tour spanning from March to August 2011.|$|E
5|$|The band's {{original}} repertoire {{consisted of}} rhythm <b>and</b> <b>blues</b> covers, but after Zappa joined the band he {{encouraged them to}} play his own original material, and the name was changed to The Mothers. The musical content of Freak Out! ranges from rhythm <b>and</b> <b>blues,</b> doo-wop and standard blues-influenced rock to orchestral arrangements and avant-garde sound collages. Although the album was initially poorly received in the United States, it was a success in Europe. It gained a cult following in America, where it continued to sell in substantial quantities until it was discontinued in the early 1970s.|$|E

With her portion of the proceeds, Mambo paid for both of her brothers to attend university and bought a car.|$|E
5|$|As a self-taught {{composer}} and performer, Zappa's diverse musical influences {{led him to}} create music that was sometimes difficult to categorize. While in his teens, he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical composers such as Edgard Varèse, Igor Stravinsky, and Anton Webern, along with 1950s rhythm <b>and</b> <b>blues</b> and doo-wop music. He began writing classical music in high school, {{while at the same}} time playing drums in rhythm <b>and</b> <b>blues</b> bands; later switching to electric guitar. His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention, Freak Out!, combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound collages. He continued this eclectic and experimental approach, irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock, jazz or classical.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} their second album, the Clash {{had started to}} depart from the punk rock sound. While touring in the United States twice in 1979, they chose {{supporting}} acts such as rhythm <b>and</b> <b>blues</b> artists Bo Diddley, Sam & Dave, Lee Dorsey, and Screamin' Jay Hawkins, as well as neotraditional country artist Joe Ely and punk rockabilly band the Cramps. This developed fascination with rock and roll inspired their approach for London Calling.|$|E

5|$|Bands {{to emerge}} from other major British cities {{included}} The Animals from Newcastle, Them from Belfast and the Spencer Davis Group and The Moody Blues from Birmingham.

5|$|From 1962 {{demand for}} blues {{recordings}} in Britain and Europe led to new outlets for American recordings, Chicago recordings that were now available included Vee Jay Records through EMI's Stateside label and Chess Records through Pye International's R series. These records were enthusiastically sought and collected {{by a new}} generation of enthusiasts. The increasing appetite for rhythm <b>and</b> <b>blues</b> was reflected in the growing numbers of Afro-American artists visiting the country. From 1962 the American Folk Blues Festival, organised by German promoters Horst Lippmann and Fritz Rau, brought American blues stars including Waters, Wolf, Sonny Boy Williamson, and John Lee Hooker to the country. In 1964 the American Folk Blues and Gospel Caravan arrived in the UK for an 11-date tour, including in its line-up Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Blind Gary Davis, Sonny Terry, Muddy Waters and Otis Spann. The original dates sold out rapidly and six more had to be added. Later that year, the first of what was to become the annual National Jazz <b>and</b> <b>Blues</b> Festival was held at Reading in Berkshire.|$|E
