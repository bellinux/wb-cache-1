40|$|A {{sorption}} compressor cell basically {{consists of}} a container that is filled with an adsorbent. When such a cell is thermally cycled, a pressure difference is created by the subsequent adsorption and desorption of the gas. As a consequence, a single sorption compressor cell inherently provides an intermittent flow. A Joule–Thomson expansion stage requires {{a more or less}} continuous flow. The standard way to obtain a continuous flow out of a sorption compressor is to use three or more compressor cells that are operated out of phase. This paper presents an <b>alternative</b> <b>compressor</b> concept that uses only one compressor cell, two buffer volumes and two check valves. Such a compressor is easier to construct and to operate and has a higher reliability at the expense of a slight variation in the cooler’s cold-end temperature. The principle was demonstrated using a sorption compressor cell that is filled with Maxsorb [The Kansai Coke & Chemicals Co. Ltd., 1 - 1 Oh-Hama, Amagasaki, Japan 660] activated carbon, is equipped with a gas-gap heat switch, and uses xenon as the working fluid. A flow of 0. 52 mg/s was achieved with a low pressure of 1. 39 bar and a high pressure of 17. 0 bar, giving a theoretical cooling power of 42 mW at 172 K. A sensitivity analysis on several control parameters has been performed experimentally. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article was to propose a {{maintenance}} strategy and a set of improvement actions for increasing the availability in a compression station of waste gases from the petroleum distillation process, composed of two <b>alternative</b> <b>compressors</b> A and B in a plant of the oil industry. The research method was the quantitative modeling. The methodology includes the calculation of the current availability and suggesting actions to raise it. Time to repair (TTR) and time between failures (TBF) were modeled for the individual compressors and for the gas compression station as a whole. With the average values of the models (MTBF and MTTR) were calculated individual availabilities of A and B (32. 4 % and 83. 3 %, respectively) and global, 96. 7 %. The data were collected from the company's information system. By the form factors associated with TBF, it was possible to affirm that, despite operating for over twenty years, both machines are in the premature failures phase. This fact is due to the exchange of raw materials, which occurred about five years ago: the plant proceeded to process heavier oil, originated from the pre-salt layer, for which the installation was not designed. Such divergence may be characterized as a design fault, associated with the corrective maintenance strategy. Finally, a list of improvements projects was presented to increase the availability of the post and terminate the phase of premature failures...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a control algorithm for an air multi-compressor system. The {{goal is to}} achieve adequate performance in terms of air pressure regulation by properly coordinating a set of compressors driven by fixed speed motors. The coordination is required to impose an upper bound to the activation frequency of electric drives. A multi-compressor system {{is intended to be}} a viable <b>alternative</b> to <b>compressor</b> systems based on Variable Speed Drives (VSD) operated by inverters, which suffer of several technical and economic drawbacks. The control strategy is based on the evaluation of the timing associated to activations/deactivations of each compressor. Such evaluation is determined by the values of physical variables that determine the system behavior, including air flows, pressures and temperature. The periodic measurement of the actual pressure is performed to dynamically adjust the estimation of relevant time instants in case of variations of working conditions. The algorithm takes into account the dynamics of the air pressure, as well as timing constraints on the minimum period between two subsequent activations of each compressor. The effectiveness of the multi-compressor solution is evaluated by simulation...|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} years of the twentieth century, the vapor {{absorption}} cycle using water-ammonia systems was popular and widely used, but after the development of the vapor compression cycle it lost much of its importance because of its low coefficient of performance (about one fifth of that of the vapor compression cycle). Nowadays, the vapor absorption cycle is used only where waste heat is available or where heat is derived from solar collectors. Absorption refrigerators are a popular <b>alternative</b> to regular <b>compressor</b> refrigerators where electricity is unreliable, costly, or unavailable, where noise from the compressor is problematic, or where surplus heat is available (e.g., from turbine exhausts or industrial processes, or from solar plants).|$|R
40|$|Air {{conditioner}} rebate programs aim {{to replace}} low efficiency air conditioning purchases with high-efficiency purchases. When participants change from {{other forms of}} mechanical cooling (or no cooling at all) to central air conditioning, {{the hope is that}} they would have adopted central air conditioning anyway. The implicit assumption is that people prefer central air conditioning to other forms of cooling. We analyze a 1990 ’s efficient central air conditioning rebate program using econometric methods to distinguish between those participants who would have adopted central air conditioning {{in the absence of the}} program and those who adopted it due to the rebate program. We find that about 5 % of participants adopted central air conditioning because of the program – increasing their energy use. These results raise questions about program effects: Is this increase in central air conditioning purely a subsidy effect, or does the program reinforce the growing social norm that air conditioning is a necessity? Could it give “good citizens ” permission to buy central air conditioning because the subsidized models are “efficient”? Using information collected as part of an <b>alternatives</b> to <b>compressor</b> cooling project and additional literature on air conditioning use behavior, we develop some potential explanations for rebate program effects and suggest design considerations for future air conditioner efficiency programs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Linear oscillatory motors {{with short}} stroke {{represent}} an excellent <b>alternative</b> in linear <b>compressor</b> applications. A novel halbach-type transverse-flux linear oscillatory motor (HTLOM) with two stators was presented, {{which has the}} advantage of without moving iron core, compact structure, light weight, easy-stacked stator and smooth thrust force characteristic. Based on the principle analysis, the static thrust force was calculated by three-dimensional (3 -D) finite element analysis (FEA). Then the dynamic simulation was presented for the resonant characteristics of current, displacement, active and reactive power and power factor versus frequency. The analysis result shows that the novel HTLOM with two stators is suitable for linear compressor application, and its maximum efficiency can be achieved at velocity resonance by spring stiffness selection. The conclusions are very significant for the further driving control in industrial usage...|$|R
40|$|METIS is the “Mid-infrared ELT Imager and Spectrograph” for the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) {{that will}} cover the thermal/mid-infrared {{wavelength}} range from 3 - 14 micron. Starting from a pumped nitrogen line at 70 K, it requires cryogenic cooling of detectors and optics at 40 K (1. 4 W), 25 K (1. 1 W), and 8 K (0. 4 W). A vibration-free cooling technology for this instrument based on sorption coolers is under development at the University of Twente in collaboration with Dutch Space. We propose a sorption-based cooler with three cascaded Joule-Thomson coolers of which the sorption compressors are all heat sunk at the 70 K platform. A helium-operated cooler is used to obtain the 8 K level with a cooling power of 0. 4 W. Here, three pre-cooling stages are used at 40 K, 25 K and 15 K. The latter two levels are provided by a hydrogen-based cooler, whereas the 40 K level is realized by a neon-based sorption cooler. Based on our space-cooler heritage, our preliminary design used sorption compressors equipped with gas-gap heat switches. These have maximum efficiency, but the gas-gap switches add significantly {{to the complexity of}} the system. Since in METIS relatively high cooling powers are required, and thus a high number of compressor cells, manufacturability is an important issue. We, therefore, developed an <b>alternative</b> cylindrical <b>compressor</b> design that uses short-pulse heating establishing a thermal wave in radial direction. This allows to omit the gas-gap heat switch. The paper discusses the adapted cell design and two METIS cooler demonstrator setups that are currently under construction...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} {{based on a}} {{rectilinear}} compressor scheme, utilizing the bunching properties of slow RF waves, has been recently proposed as an <b>alternative</b> to magnetic <b>compressors</b> {{in order to avoid}} beam quality degradation due to Coherent Synchrotron Radiation effects. We present here a theoretical and numerical study of the beam dynamics in an S-band photoinjector with rectilinear compressor, as proposed for the SPARC project. 1 TRANSVERSE BEAM DYNAMICS IN RADIO-FREQUENCY COMPRESSORS Whenever a beam is injected into an RF structure at the zero acceleration phase and slips back up to the peak acceleration phase undergoing a quarter of synchrotron oscillation, it can be compressed [1]. In this section we present the theoretical description of transverse beam dynamics in RF compressors, and, in particular, the theoretical explanation on how the emittance correction process can be implemented in these devices. The analytical model is basically an extension of the invariant envelope theory [2], applicable to quasi-laminar beams carrying a constant current, to the case of currents variable along the beam line (i. e. growing together with energy along the RF compressor). It is known that the invariant envelope is given by () γγσ 24...|$|R
40|$|Restrictions for {{environmental}} reasons {{on the use}} of CFCs and HCFCs, the traditional working fluids in heat pumps, refrigeration plants and air conditioning, have led to the use of pure HFCs and blends of HFCs. However, since HFCs have a different influence on compressor oils, new oils that are compatible with HFCs need to be found. A likely <b>alternative</b> for <b>compressor</b> oils is polyol ester oils (POE), but POEs differ in solubility, which is one important factor when selecting a successful compressor oil. To minimize costly experimentation, new thermodynamic tools that can predict the solubility of HFCs in compressor oils will be very useful. To develop a predictive model for solubility, based on a group-contribution concept, experimental values for pure substances with known structure are needed. Thus, solubility measurements were made for 13 binary systems of four HFCs in four long-chained hydrocarbons (lcHCs) and for 20 binary systems of five HFCs in four pentaerythritol tetra alkyl esters (PEs), where the latter is one type of POEs. Based on these data a modified Flory-Huggins-based predictive model, termed MFH, was developed. This model is of the heterogeneous type; the vapour phase is calculated with an equation of state and the liquid phase with an activity factor model. A simple version of this model was used to describe data for 14 binary HFC-lcHC mixtures with 7 general parameters and a relative deviation between calculated and experimental data, DP, of 4. 1 %. A more extended version was used to describe data for the 20 binary HFC-PE mixtures with 15 general parameters and a DP of 3. 4 %. While DP increases from 1. 8 to 3. 4 % when the MFH model is used instead of correlation with the traditional Flory-Huggins model, the number of empirical parameters decreases from 60 to 15. Furthermore, the 15 parameters are general and the MFH model can thus also be used to predict solubility of HFCs in PEs that have no measured data available...|$|R

The basic compressor/de-compressor structure of this method is a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network. In adaptive approach different Back-Propagation artificial neural networks are used as compressor and de-compressor and this is done by dividing the image into blocks, computing the complexity of each block and then selecting one network for each block according to its complexity value. Three complexity measure methods, called Entropy, Activity and Pattern-based are used to determine the level of complexity in image blocks and their ability in complexity estimation are evaluated and compared. In training and evaluation, each image block is assigned to a network based on its complexity value. Best-SNR is another <b>alternative</b> in selecting <b>compressor</b> network for image blocks in evolution phase which chooses one of the trained networks such that results best SNR in compressing the input image block.

40|$|AbstractIn {{a modern}} gas turbine, using {{superheated}} steam {{to cool the}} vane and blade for internal convection cooling is a promising <b>alternative</b> to traditional <b>compressor</b> air. However, further investigations of steam cooling need to be performed. In this paper, the three-dimensional flow and heat transfer characteristics of steam are numerically investigated in two-pass square channels with 45 ° ribbed walls under stationary and rotating conditions. The investigated rotation numbers are 0 and 0. 24. The simulation is carried out by solving the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations employing the Reynolds stress turbulence model, especially considering two additional terms for Coriolis and rotational buoyancy forces caused by the rotating effect. For comparison, calculations for the air-cooled channels are done first at a Reynolds number of 25 000 and inlet coolant-to-wall density ratio of 0. 13. The results are compared with the experiment data. Then the flow and heat transfer in steam-cooled channels are analyzed under the same operating conditions. The {{results indicate that the}} superheated steam has better heat transfer performance than air. Due to the combined effect of rotation, skewed ribs and 180 ° sharp turn, the secondary flow pattern in steam-cooled rotating two-pass channels is quite complex. This complex secondary flow pattern leads to strong anisotropic turbulence and high level of anisotropy of Reynolds stresses, which {{have a significant impact on}} the local heat transfer coefficient distributions...|$|R

A válvula do compressor é um dispositivo ímpar, umas vez que seu funcionamento se dá pela ação da pressão exercida pelo escoamento, caracterizando um problema de forte interação fluido- estrutura. O uso da modelagem numérica através das ferramentas da mecânica dos fluidos computacional (CFD) tem se destacado como a alternativa mais dinâmica para o estudo do fenômeno. O trabalho desenvolvido foi voltado para o estudo numérico do escoamento através do difusor radial, o qual é um modelo simplificado da válvula, com o emprego do Método da Fronteira Imersa com Modelo Físico Virtual para a modelagem do disco superior do difusor (palheta). O ponto forte desta metodologia é que a representação de regiões sólidas é feita pelo cálculo de um campo de força, o qual é introduzido nas equações das células na vizinhança do sólido. Este procedimento dispensa o uso de malhas que se adaptam ao corpo, possibilitando o uso de malhas cartesianas convencionas para modelar geometrias complexas e móveis. A metodologia foi acoplada com a solução das equações governantes do escoamento em coordenadas cilíndricas através do Método dos Volumes Finitos. Inicialmente, a metodologia foi validada, utilizando como dados de referência resultados provenientes de estudos numéricos e experimentais, e foi avaliada a influência dos parâmetros do procedimento na qualidade final dos resultados.

The fully {{understanding of the}} flow through automatic valves of <b>alternative</b> hermetic <b>compressors</b> is essentiall to introduce modifications in its project aiming {{the improvement of the}} compressor performance and, also, the refrigeration cycle. The compressor valve is a singular device, once its operation is ruled by the flow pressure, characterizing a case with a strong fluid-structure interaction. The using of numerical tools trough the methods of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has gained especial attention due to its flexibility to study the phenomenon. The present work was developed to study numerically the flow through the radial diffuser, which is a simplified model of the valve, with the employment of the Immersed Boundary Method with Virtual Physical Model to modeling the superior disk (valve reed). The main advantage of this methodology is that the modeling of solid boundaries is performed with the calculus of a force field, which is introduced in the cells equations nearby the solid. This procedure dispenses the using of body-fitted meshes, enabling the adoption of conventional Cartesian meshes to model complex and moving geometries. The methodology was coupled with the solution of the governing equations in cylindrical coordinates though the Finite Volume Method. Firstly, the methodology was validated, confronting the results obtained with data from numerical and experimental studies, where the influence of the main parameters in the quality of the final results was evaluated. In the second step were developed preliminary studies concerning the movement of the superior disk, whose opening and closing movements were artificially imposed. The results obtained showed that the adopted methodology is quit promising and flexible, and can be employed in more refined studies to the comprehension of the flow through the valve regarding the fluid-structure interaction that rules the proble...|$|R
