2500|$|The Iranian {{government}} released {{footage of}} a captured RQ-170 on 8 December. The captured drone {{appeared to be}} largely intact, except for minor damage on its left wing. Dan Goure, {{an analyst at the}} Lexington Institute, stated the largely intact airframe ruled out the possibility of an engine or navigational malfunction: [...] "Either this was a cyber/electronic warfare attack system that brought the system down or it was a glitch in the command-and-control system". On 8 December, a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Washington Post that the U.S. cannot be certain the drone shown was real because the U.S. does not have access to it, but also stated that [...] "We have no indication that it was brought down by hostile fire." [...] A second senior U.S. military official said that a major question is how the drone could have remained [...] "virtually intact," [...] given the high altitude from which it is thought to have crashed. After examining the video on 8 Dec, US officials confirmed that the drone was genuine, even though some civilians had initially expressed doubt. Bill Sweetman, an author with an interest in military planes, speculated that the Iranians did not shoot down the plane (citing the lack of burn marks, holes, or outward damage) or hack into the system, postulating that <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>failure</b> downed the plane, and that the plane could be intact from what is known as a [...] "flat spin" [...] or [...] "falling leaf departure".|$|E
2500|$|Jet {{supports}} {{transaction processing}} for database {{systems that have}} this capability. (ODBC systems have one-level transaction processing, while several ISAM systems like Paradox do not support transaction processing.) A transaction {{is a series of}} operations performed on a database that must be done together [...] this is known as atomicity {{and is one of the}} ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability), concepts considered to be the key transaction processing features of a database management system. For transaction processing to work (until Jet 3.0), the programmer needed to begin the transaction manually, perform the operations needed to be performed in the transaction, and then commit (save) the transaction. Until the transaction is committed, changes are made only in memory and not actually written to disk. Transactions have a number of advantages over independent database updates. One of the main advantages is that transactions can be abandoned if a problem occurs during the transaction. This is called rolling back the transaction, or just rollback, and it restores the state of the database records to precisely the state before the transaction began. Transactions also permit the state of the database to remain consistent if <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>failure</b> occurs in the middle of a sequence of updates required to be atomic. There is no chance that only some of the updates will end up written to the database; either all will succeed, or the changes will be discarded when the database system restarts. With ODBC's in-memory policy, transactions also allow for many updates to a record to occur entirely within memory, with only one expensive disk write at the end.|$|E

50|$|Within {{the scope}} of an {{individual}} system, fault tolerance {{can be achieved by}} anticipating exceptional conditions and building the system to cope with them, and, in general, aiming for self-stabilization so that the system converges towards an error-free state. However, if the consequences of <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>failure</b> are catastrophic, or the cost of making it sufficiently reliable is very high, a better solution may be to use some form of duplication. In any case, if the consequence of <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>failure</b> is so catastrophic, the system must be able to use reversion to fall back to a safe mode. This is similar to roll-back recovery but can be a human action if humans are present in the loop.|$|E
