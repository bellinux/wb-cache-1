The couple leaves in the woman's car (a silver Porsche) as Timberlake rolls down the window of a black Mercedes, from which he and his friend have been watching the woman. Timberlake breaks into the house by throwing a rock through a window and proceeds through the woman's house, with anti-gravity jumps and slides, not causing any other visible damage, except for kicking a picture frame of the woman <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> Then he searches some drawers and finds a video camera, while the driver of the car, Timbaland, signals for his female accomplice {{in the back of the}} car, played by model Kiana Bessa, to go in. She enters the house and goes with Timberlake to a bedroom, where she starts to undress and kiss him while being filmed. They stay in the bedroom for a moment; then the accomplice exits the house but Timberlake stays. As the blonde woman returns, he follows her around the house and hides in a closet as she showers. He gets closer to her and touches the glass surrounding the shower. The blonde woman senses someone in the room and turns around, but Timberlake is gone. She leaves the bathroom and goes into her bedroom, where the video he made with his new lover plays on the television.|$|E

40|$|Ankara : The Department of Interior Architecture and Environmental Design and the Institute of Economics and Social Sciences of Bilkent University, 2010. Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2010. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 83 - 86. The {{main focus}} {{of this study is}} examining the activities that are performed in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and interior design of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> In <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> both private and public activities can be performed. Living room serves as a stage where dwellers reflect their identity to the outside world. In this study, the factors that affect the use and interior design of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> are defined. According to these factors, the group differences in the use and interior design of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> has been examined. A field survey was conducted in “Angora Evleri” which is an upper income suburb in Ankara. Results indicated that the existence of the family room affected the type, number and frequency of activities that were performed in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> existence of the family room also affected the intentions for the interior design and the selected interior design elements in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> selected interior design elements in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> varied according to different groups of users. The results of the study indicated that the interior design of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> was related to gender, occupational status and time spent in the house, whereas the use of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> seemed independent of these factors.

500|$|<b>The</b> Ellwood House <b>living</b> <b>room</b> did {{not exist}} until Perry Ellwood's 1911 remodeling. <b>The</b> {{original}} <b>living</b> <b>room</b> space was laid out as two rooms with pocket doors joining them. In <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> a wall between the sitting room was removed which created a large, open space to which a vaulted ceiling was added. Perry Ellwood's <b>living</b> <b>room</b> was designed to function with the newly added sunroom and south terrace as one large living and entertaining space. The terrace can be accessed through French doors from both <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and sunroom. <b>The</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> was designed to reflect English country houses c. 1650, during the Stuart period. The room was designed by Roy Terwilliger, an interior designer with Marshall Field & Company in Chicago and May Ellwood's cousin. <b>The</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> features a [...] "pargework" [...] ceiling constructed of molded plaster and designed with a geometric theme.

50|$|Direct Link Setup allows direct station-to-station frame {{transfer}} {{within a}} basic service set. This is designed primarily for consumer use, where station-to-station transfer is more commonly used. For example, when streaming video to a television <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> or printing to a wireless printer {{in the same}} room, it can be more efficient to send Wi-Fi frames directly between the two communicating devices, instead of using the standard technique of always sending everything via the AP, which involves two radio hops instead of one. Also, If the AP is far away in some distant part of the home, sending all the frames to the AP and back may require them to be sent at a lower transmission rate. However, DLS requires participation from the AP to facilitate the more efficient direct communication, and few, if any, APs have the necessary support for this. Tunnelled Direct Link Setup was published as 802.11z (TDLS), allowing devices to perform more efficient direct station-to-station frame transfers without support from the AP. Both DLS and TLDS require that stations {{be associated with the}} same AP. Both DLS and TLDS improve the speed and efficiency of communications between members of a basic service set, but they do not facilitate communication between devices that are near to each other but not associated with the same AP.|$|E

30|$|When <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> did not require cooling but the FCU was being operated {{due to the}} {{requirements}} of other rooms, the air temperature of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> was 0.5  K lower than the set value, as shown in segment C of Fig.  7, and it was found that <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> air temperature could reach a maximum of 2.6  K lower than the set value. Because the door of the room where dehumidification was required was closed, the humidity could not be satisfied in this room, so dehumidification was still required, and <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> was consequently over-cooled. Therefore, if a door is closed because of sleeping, leading to the airflow being limited, the representative room not requiring cooling might become over-cooled, while other rooms that need dehumidification might not be dehumidified; considerations of these conditions are necessary for system design.|$|R
