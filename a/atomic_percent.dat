40|$|A {{practice}} {{of special interest}} for metallurgical steelmaking {{is the relationship between}} redistribution of solute elements and dendrite microsegregation that occurs during solidification. These phenomena {{have a significant impact on}} the final properties of cast and forged products. In this paper, a calculation of the characteristic chemical phases in S 355 steel using a software program Thermo-Calc is presented. Also, the paper presents experimental measurements of the dendrites size and non-metallic inclusions using optical and electron probe microanalyzer, as well as the calculation of the local solidification rate on the particular example. These phenomena are of special interest when it comes to thin castings and higher cooling rates. Thin castings require higher quality of casting surface, corresponding distribution, and character than those of non-metallic inclusions. Thermo-calc software was used for calculation of equilibrium phases, temperature ranges of solidification of tested material, and temperature range for developing characteristic equilibrium phase. It was found that during solidification and cooling processes manganese sulphide inclusions were formed. Additionally, accurate values for solidus and liquidus temperatures, which coincide with the values of solidus and liquidus temperatures obtained by the Thermo Calc, were calculated. Using optical and electron probe microanalyzer, the type of inclusions were confirmed, whereas chemical composition and size measurement of dendrites, and formed non-metallic inclusions were determined. Mapping and Linescan methods were used to examine the size and exact chemical composition of sulphides in <b>atomic</b> <b>percents.</b> Using secondary dendrites local solidification rate was calculated (for casting surface area solidification rate was 5 K/s).

For a 5. 0 x io mol L solution of Cu(I), the onset of the aluminum codeposition process was found to occur at around 0. 30 V vs. the Al(III) /Al couple; however, a limiting current for the reduction of Cu(I) to pure copper metal can be observed in the 0. 60 — 0. 30 V potential interval in this solution.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{variations}} in plasma parameters on the fluorination, degradation, and etching of poly(ester sulfonic) acid (AQ 55) anionomeric membranes was examined. The determination {{of how the}} plasma gas composition, power, proximity of the sample to the glow, and time of exposure {{could be used to}} maximize surface fluorination and minimize degradation of polymer films is discussed. Membrane surfaces were characterized using contact angles, SEM, gravimetric analysis, DSC, FTIR/MIR, and XPS. These techniques aided in the determination of changes in surface energy, surface topography, sample weight, bulk property, and the identification and quantification of chemical functionalities produced at the AQ 55 surface after plasma modification. For all plasma treatments, a range of 9 % to 60 % atomic fluorine was detected within a depth of 50 A. The degree of fluorination was enhanced by limiting the effects of surface etching and degradation. Three factors which were found to promote surface degradation and etching included; the presence of oxygen, high energy ion bombardment, and elevated plasma temperatures. Under these conditions, the effects of degradation and etching were increased with time of exposure. Gas mixtures of 5 % 02 / 10 % Ar/ 85 % CF 4 and 10 % Ar/ 90 % CF 4 were used to ascertain the type and degree of modification produced with and without the presence of oxygen. An increase in the power from 20 W to 50 W increased plasma-surface interactions which resulted in an increase of 10 % atomic fluorine at the surface. The effects of ion bombardment were reduced by suspending a quartz plate over the samples during plasma modification. This proved to double the <b>percent</b> <b>atomic</b> fluorine and eliminate degradation and/or etching at the AQ 55 surface.

APV experiments provide a stringent {{test of the}} Standard Model of particles physics with high sensitivity for physics beyond. Ultra-narrow transitions in Ra+ can be employed for optical frequency standards, or “clocks”. As an important step towards such experiments excited-state laser spectroscopy was performed on short-lived trapped 209 - 214 Ra+ ions produced from the AGOR cyclotron at KVI. Hyperfine structure constants of Ra+ atomic states and isotope shifts of relevant transitions were studied, providing benchmarks for the required <b>atomic</b> theory at <b>percent</b> level accuracy. The measurement of a lower limit of the lifetime of the meta-stable 6 d 2 D 5 / 2 state provides an important confirmation of the fundamental availability of long coherence times in the trapped Ra+ system, required for high-quality clocks. The potential of the electric quadrupole transitions 7 s 2 S 1 / 2 - 6 d 2 D 3 / 2, 6 d 2 D 5 / 2 in Ra+ isotopes as single-ion optical frequency standards was explored.
