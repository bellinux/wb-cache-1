40|$|Since 1990 the {{telecommunication}} {{sector in}} Poland has been undergoing rapid development and modernization. It is heavily dominated by Telekommunikacja Polska SA (TP SA), a state-owned company which is split into 10 regional directorates. Although TP SA enjoys a legal monopoly only over international traffic, it is a de facto monopolist in the Polish market too. Apart from difficulties in funding local telephone operations, many of the difficulties facing private competitors to TP SA focus on interconnection and pricing issues.

These German publishers have taken advantage of the transformation and liberalization after 1990 and have massively invested in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. In Poland, dailies were published by both of the aforementioned groups. Axel Springer AG produces the tabloid daily Fakt and between 2006 and 2009 the group produced the semi-tabloid Dziennik. Verlagsgruppe Passau has owned a variety of regional dailies (now merged under one umbrella and published only a few times a week). With regard to the historical burden on the relationship between Poland and Germany, the position of a German publisher in the field of opinion-forming media is rather difficult. This thesis compares the operation of the two aforementioned publishers on the Polish press market, with the focus on how they entered the market and expanded their business, on the influence of the publisher on the editorial slant, on the controversies with the <b>Anti-Monopoly</b> <b>Office,</b> and on their attitude towards their competitors and the Polish political representation. Activities beyond publishing and standards imposed in the parent and subsidiary [...] ...|$|E
