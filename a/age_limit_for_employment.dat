50|$|The <b>age</b> <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> pederasty {{in ancient}} Greece seems to encompass, at the minimum end, boys of {{twelve years of}} age. To love a boy below {{the age of twelve}} was {{considered}} inappropriate, but no evidence exists of any legal penalties attached to this sort of practice. Traditionally, a pederastic relationship could continue until the widespread growth of the boy's body hair, when he is considered a man. Thus, the <b>age</b> <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> the younger member of a pederastic relationship seems to have extended from 12 to about 17 years of age.|$|R
