5|$|Nuttin {{frames the}} cause {{in terms of}} ownership, which has roots in {{economic}} psychology. The endowment effect has found that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. Nuttin puts the name-letter effect down to people automatically liking and valuing <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> is connected to them. As such, the name-letter effect {{is just one example}} of a more general mere-ownership effect. In which case, various verifiable predictions follow.|$|E

Having stopped and lowered all her boats, Hogue was struck by two torpedoes around 06:55. The sudden weight loss of the two torpedoes caused U-9 to broach the surface and Hogues gunners opened fire without effect before the submarine could submerge again. The cruiser capsized about ten minutes after being torpedoed and sank at 07:15.|$|E

5|$|Camouflage is the {{concealment}} {{of animals}} or objects of military interest by {{any combination of}} methods that helps them to remain unnoticed.

At the same time, Kathryn (Anastasia Griffith) also continues to visit David, showing him pictures to jog his memory but later admits, although he claimed otherwise to Kathryn, to Mary Margaret that he doesn't remember <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> {{he saw in the}} pictures. As Mary Margaret notices David becoming more attracted to her, she still feels threatened by Kathryn's presence. This prompts Mary Margaret to submit her letter of resignation as a volunteer at the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaurs began {{appearing}} in films {{soon after the}} introduction of cinema, the first being the good-natured animated Gertie the Dinosaur in 1914. However, lovable dinosaurs were quickly replaced by monsters as moviemakers recognized the potential of huge frightening monsters. D. W. Griffith in 1914's Brute Force provided the first example of a threatening cinematic dinosaur, a Ceratosaurus who menaced cavemen. This film enshrined the fiction that dinosaurs and early humans lived together, {{and set up the}} cliché that dinosaurs were bloodthirsty and attacked <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> moved.|$|E

5|$|Evidently {{the great}} mass of laboring men failed to {{comprehend}} the situation. Too much then, as now, capital was their enemy, not their friend. Too much then, as now, in their way of thinking, there was no limit {{to the ability of}} capital. They did not see that capital could not pay wages, buy raw material and manufacture goods unless it could sell its products and get returns.

5|$|Goya {{worked on}} The Disasters of War {{during a period}} when he was {{producing}} images more for his own satisfaction than for any contemporary audience.
