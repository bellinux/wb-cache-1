The LIRR would be rebuilt, grade-separated, and electrified. The Richmond Hill station would be renovated for additional LIRR service, while the Hollis <b>and</b> <b>Queens</b> Village stations would be converted from side platform stations to island platform configurations. This $488 million option, {{to be completed by}} 1995, was also opposed by people living along the Montauk Branch.|$|E
