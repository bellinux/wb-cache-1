5|$|On December 19, a small {{low-level}} circulation {{was located}} along the northwest coastline of Borneo; <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> plume {{of cold air}} progressed southward through the South China Sea on the southeastern periphery of a ridge over the Far East. The vortex drifted southwestward, reaching open water by December 21. The northerly air surge was deflected after interacting with the circulation, and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> portion of the air surge crossed the equator. The southerly flow turned eastward, then northward, and {{in combination with the}} northerly flow it wrapped into the vortex, resulting in rapid development of the low-level circulation, just a short distance north of the equator. By December 25, an area of scattered convection persisted about 370km (230mi) east of Singapore within an area of low wind shear, in association with the low-level circulation. Continuing slowly westward, the convection deepened and organized further, and at 1200UTC on December 26 the disturbance developed into a tropical depression about 230km (145mi) east of Singapore, or 156km (97mi) north of the equator. This was the first recorded occurrence of a tropical cyclone near the equator.|$|E
