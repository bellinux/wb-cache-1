5|$|In January 2011, the USAF {{opened the}} Raptor enhancement, {{development}} and integration (REDI) contract to bidders, with a $16 billion budget. In November 2011, Lockheed Martin's upgrade contract ceiling {{was raised to}} $7.4 billion. Nearly $2 billion was allocated for structural repairs and to achieve fleet <b>availability</b> <b>rate</b> of 70.6% by 2015. However, only 63% was achieved. Some F-35 technology, such as more durable stealth coatings, have been applied to the F-22. By 2012, the update schedule had slipped seven years due to instability in requirements and funding. In 2014 the USAF moved to cut upgrade funding.|$|E
5|$|During Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, 86 AV-8Bs amassed 3,380 {{flights and}} about 4,100 flight hours, {{with a mission}} <b>availability</b> <b>rate</b> of over 90 percent. Five AV-8Bs were lost to enemy surface-to-air missiles, and two USMC pilots were killed. The AV-8B had an {{attrition}} rate of 1.5 aircraft for every 1,000 sorties flown. U.S. Army General Norman Schwarzkopf later named the AV-8B among the seven weapons—along with the F-117 Nighthawk and AH-64 Apache—that {{played a crucial role}} in the war. In the aftermath of the war, from 27 August 1992, until 2003, USMC AV-8Bs and other aircraft patrolled Iraqi skies in support of Operation Southern Watch. The AV-8Bs launched from amphibious assault ships in the Persian Gulf, and from forward operating bases such as Ali Al Salem Air Base, Kuwait.|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Air Force had two {{heavy bomber}} groups. The 43rd Bombardment Group was {{equipped}} with about 55 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses.

The recently arrived 90th Bombardment Group {{was equipped with}} Consolidated B-24 Liberators, but they too had maintenance problems. There were two medium groups: the 38th Bombardment Group, equipped with B-25 Mitchells, and the 22nd Bombardment Group, equipped with Martin B-26 Marauders, {{but two of the}} former’s four squadrons had been diverted to the South Pacific Area, and the latter had taken so many losses that it had been withdrawn to Australia to be rebuilt.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} {{the availability of}} allied health care in nursing homes in the Netherlands, and its dependency on characteristics of the nursing home. Methods. Structured surveys by telephone were carried out {{in a sample of}} 100 from a country total of 286 somatic (for somatic patients only) and combined (with units for both somatic and psychogeriatric patients) nursing homes. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to determine relationships between the availability of care and the type of nursing home, its country location (urban/non-urban) and the presence of specific wards/units within the nursing home. Results. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy were present in almost all nursing homes (99 % and 93 % respectively); 92 % of the nursing homes offered speech- and language therapy and 88 % had dietetics available. Average <b>availability</b> <b>rates</b> were: 2. 16 full time equivalents per 100 beds/places for physiotherapy, 0. 96 for occupational therapy, 0. 38 for speech- and language therapy and 0. 18 for dietetics. Somatic nursing homes and nursing homes with stroke-units, day-care, or outpatient care present, had higher <b>availability</b> <b>rates</b> on allied health care. Conclusions. Allied health care disciplines varied in terms of full-time equivalents per 100 beds/places. Per discipline also a wide variation exists in full-time equivalents per 100 beds/places among all participating nursing homes, regardless of their type. Characteristics of nursing homes had small effects on <b>availability</b> <b>rates.</b> International research is recommended in order to compare data and eventually reach consensus on optimal <b>availability</b> <b>rates</b> of allied health care in nursing homes, tuned to the demand...|$|R

In January 2013, eight NH90s were on firm order. On 1 August 2013, Belgium received its first NH90 NFH at Full Operational Capability (FOC). On 23 October 2013, Belgium's first NH90 TTH entered service, the last was delivered on 13 November 2014.

The availability in specialized stores and supermarkets was expressed as <b>availability</b> <b>rates</b> based on {{the total number of}} products. The price of the SF, SR, and low GI products were compared with their conventional counterparts. <b>Availability</b> <b>rates</b> were higher in supermarkets than in specialized stores by product numbers (14. 29 % versus 3. 76 %, respectively; p < 0. 001) and by product categories (53. 57 % versus 26. 92 %, respectively; p < 0. 001). Five categories of products labeled as SF, SR, and low GI (oats, cookies and crackers, flours, snacks, and tostadas/totopos) had higher prices than their conventional counterparts (p < 0. 05).
