40|$|The {{inhibitory}} {{effects of}} 29 commercial powdered spices {{on the growth}} and toxin production of three species of toxigenic Aspergillus were observed by introducing these materials into culture media for mycotoxin production.

5000|$|El Bajío {{consists}} of ten restaurants in Mexico City which {{are dedicated to}} preserving traditional Mexican cooking, with no aims of reinventing the food or making it haute cuisine.

These include a morning menu of Veracruz specialties such as gorditas with brown sugar and <b>anise</b> <b>seed,</b> Ramírez Degollado and Veracruz style tamales and atole with fresh fruit along with various egg dishes. [...] Later in the day specialties include ceviche verde, various mole sauces especially mole de olla and Xico style, fish Veracruz style and well as daily specials.

5000|$|Betel chewing {{has very}} long {{tradition}} in Burma, having been practised {{since before the}} beginning of recorded history. Until the 1960s, both men and women loved it and every household used to have a special lacquerware box for paan, called kun-it (...) , which would be offered to any visitor together with cheroots to smoke and green tea to drink. The leaves are kept inside the bottom of the box, which looks like a small hat box, but with a top tray for small tins, silver in well-to-do homes, of various other ingredients such as the betel nuts, slaked lime, cutch, <b>anise</b> <b>seed</b> and a nut cutter. The sweet form (acho) is popular with the young, but grownups tend to prefer it with cardamom, cloves and tobacco. Spittoons, therefore, are still ubiquitous, and signs saying [...] "No paan-spitting" [...] are commonplace, as it makes a messy red splodge on floors and walls; many people display betel-stained teeth from the habit. Paan stalls and kiosks used to be run mainly by people of Indian origin in towns and cities. Smokers who want to kick the habit would also use betel nut to wean themselves off tobacco.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{commonly}} used to indicate the biscuits of Prato, biscotti di Prato, in modern Italy and Argentina they are also known widely by the name [...] "cantuccini".

Rusks are larger, longer biscuits, rustic bread dough enriched with olive oil and <b>anise</b> <b>seeds.</b>|$|R
