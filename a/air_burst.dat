5|$|Maclagen {{sent the}} 11th Battalion, Captain Joseph Lalor's {{company of the}} 12th Battalion and Major James Robertson's of the 9th, towards Baby 700. Brockman divided his own company, sending half up the right fork of Rest Gully, and half up the left, while Brockman and a reserve platoon headed up Monash Valley. As they moved forward, Turkish {{artillery}} targeted them with <b>air</b> <b>burst</b> shrapnel shells, which dispersed the companies. This, coupled with senior officers diverting men to other areas instead of towards Baby 700, meant only fragments of the units eventually reached Baby 700.|$|E
5|$|The Baker {{explosion}} ejected {{into the}} environment about twice as many free neutrons as there were fission events. A plutonium fission event produces, on average, 2.9 neutrons, {{most of which are}} consumed in the production of more fission, until fission falls off and the remaining uncaptured neutrons escape. In an <b>air</b> <b>burst,</b> most of these environmental neutrons are absorbed by superheated air which rises into the stratosphere, along with the fission products and unfissioned plutonium. In the underwater Baker detonation, the neutrons were captured by seawater in the lagoon.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Arkansas {{participated in}} Operation Magic Carpet, the {{repatriation}} of American servicemen from the Pacific. She took around 800 men back to the United States, departing on 23 September, and reaching Seattle, Washington on 15 October. She made another three Magic Carpet trips between Pearl Harbor and the continental United States to ferry more soldiers home. During the first months of 1946, Arkansas lay at San Francisco. In late April, the ship got underway for Hawaii. She reached Pearl Harbor on 8 May, and departed Pearl Harbor on 20 May, bound for Bikini Atoll, earmarked for use as target for atomic bomb testing in Operation Crossroads. On 1 July, Arkansas was exposed to an <b>air</b> <b>burst</b> in ABLE, but survived with extensive shock damage to her upperworks, while her hull and armored turrets were lightly damaged.|$|E

5|$|Operation Crossroads {{began with}} the first blast (Test Able), an <b>air</b> <b>burst</b> on 1 July 1946; Nagato was not close to ground zero and was only lightly damaged. For Test Baker, an {{underwater}} explosion, the ship was positioned closer to ground zero. Nagato rode out the tsunami {{of water from the}} explosion with little apparent damage; she had a slight starboard list of two degrees after the tsunami dissipated. A more thorough assessment could not be made because she was dangerously radioactive. Her list gradually increased over the next five days and she capsized during the night of 29/30 July. Opened to divers in 1996, The Times has named Nagato {{as one of the top}} 10 wreck diving sites in the world.|$|E
5|$|Their {{desire to}} return to Bikini was thwarted indefinitely by the U.S. {{decision}} to resume nuclear testing at Bikini in 1954. During 1954, 1956, and 1958, twenty-one more nuclear bombs were detonated at Bikini, yielding a total of , equivalent to more than three thousand Baker bombs. Only one was an <b>air</b> <b>burst,</b> the 3.8 megaton Redwing Cherokee test. Air bursts distribute fallout in a large area, but surface bursts produce intense local fallout. The first after Crossroads was the dirtiest: the 15 megaton Bravo shot of Operation Castle on March 1, 1954, which was the largest-ever U.S. test. Fallout from Bravo caused radiation injury to Bikini islanders who were living on Rongelap Atoll.|$|E
25|$|When an <b>air</b> <b>burst</b> occurs, lethal blast {{and thermal}} effects {{proportionally}} scale much {{more rapidly than}} lethal radiation effects, as higher and higher yield nuclear weapons are used.|$|E
50|$|At that point, {{at least}} three enemy guns opened fire on the ship. The first salvo was a direct hit, on the main deck, {{starboard}} side; several pieces of shrapnel penetrated the shield of mount 51 and wounded three of the mount's crew. Two <b>air</b> <b>bursts</b> followed in quick succession, one {{on either side of}} the bridge. Within two minutes time, the North Korean guns had registered four more direct hits and at least seven <b>air</b> <b>bursts</b> near the ship.|$|R
2500|$|On March 18, 1953, [...] was {{carrying}} out bombardment duties at Wonsan when two <b>air</b> <b>bursts</b> and one surface round landed near the ship. On March 22, during another heavy bombardment, two 90-millimeter <b>air</b> <b>bursts</b> and two 105-millimeter rounds landed near the Missouri {{but she was}} undamaged. [...] and the Waxbill also received fire but no damage resulted {{in any of the}} attacks. The Prichett was attacked again on March 25 but no damage was sustained, , , ROKN AMS-502 and AMS-515 engaged in a similar action the following day.|$|R
50|$|In {{conventional}} warfare, <b>air</b> <b>bursts</b> {{are used}} primarily against infantry {{in the open}} or unarmored targets, as the resulting fragments cover a large area but will not penetrate armor, entrenchments, or fortifications.|$|R
25|$|A smaller <b>air</b> <b>burst</b> {{occurred}} over a populated area in Russia on 15 February 2013, at Chelyabinsk in the Ural district of Russia. The exploding meteoroid was an asteroid that measured about 17 to 20 metres across, {{with an estimated}} initial mass of 11,000 tonnes, and inflicted over 1,200 injuries, mainly from broken glass falling from windows shattered by its shock wave.|$|E
25|$|At 7:15a.m. on 30 June 1908, {{millions}} of trees were felled near the Podkamennaya Tunguska (Stony Tunguska) River in central Siberia in the Tunguska Event. Most scientists believe this {{resulted from the}} <b>air</b> <b>burst</b> of a meteor or a comet. Even though no crater has ever been found, the landscape in the (uninhabited) area still bears the scars of this event.|$|E
25|$|When {{people are}} indoors, running to windows to {{investigate}} the source of bright flashes in the sky still remains a common and natural response to experiencing a bright flash. Thus, although the advice to duck and cover is over half a century old, ballistic glass lacerations caused {{the majority of the}} 1000 human injuries following the Chelyabinsk meteor <b>air</b> <b>burst</b> of February 15, 2013.|$|E
50|$|The {{lifetime}} of the Wilson cloud during nuclear <b>air</b> <b>bursts</b> can be shortened by the thermal {{radiation from the}} fireball, which heats the cloud above the dew point and evaporates the droplets.|$|R
50|$|The term {{may also}} refer to {{naturally}} occurring <b>air</b> <b>bursts</b> {{arising from the}} explosions of incoming meteors as happened in the Tunguska event, the 1930 Curuçá River event, and the Chelyabinsk meteor event.|$|R

25|$|Most of the {{material}} damage caused by a nuclear <b>air</b> <b>burst</b> {{is caused by a}} combination of the high static overpressures and the blast winds. The long compression of the blast wave weakens structures, which are then torn apart by the blast winds. The compression, vacuum and drag phases together may last several seconds or longer, and exert forces many times greater than the strongest hurricane.|$|E
25|$|The Hague Conventions {{prohibited}} poison weapons. The radioactivity of {{the atomic}} bombings {{has been described as}} poisonous, especially in the form of nuclear fallout which kills more slowly. However, this view was rejected by the International Court of Justice in 1996, which stated that the primary and exclusive use of (<b>air</b> <b>burst)</b> nuclear weapons is not to poison or asphyxiate and thus is not prohibited by the Geneva Protocol.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} the {{explosion}} is controversial, and still much disputed to this day. Although the {{cause of the}} explosion is the subject of debate, it is commonly believed to have been caused by the <b>air</b> <b>burst</b> of a large meteoroid or comet fragment at an altitude of 510kilometres (36miles) above the Earth's surface. Different studies have yielded varying estimates of the object's size, with general agreement that it was a few tens of metres across.|$|E
50|$|Stop: Complete {{blockage}} {{followed by}} sudden release, as in t, d, p, b, k, g. The blockage of air causes air pressure to build up; when released, the <b>air</b> <b>bursts</b> out, giving these sounds their characteristic sharp quality.|$|R
50|$|In nuclear warfare, <b>air</b> <b>bursts</b> {{are used}} against soft targets (i.e. lacking the {{hardened}} construction required to survive overpressure from a nuclear explosion) such as cities in countervalue targeting, or airfields, radar systems and mobile ICBMs in counterforce targeting.|$|R
50|$|Many other observers, {{including}} Human Rights Watch military experts, {{reported seeing}} white phosphorus <b>air</b> <b>bursts</b> over Gaza City and the Jabalya refugee camp. The BBC published {{a photograph of}} two shells exploding over a densely populated area on 11 January.|$|R
25|$|Shore {{batteries}} {{increased their}} effectiveness as well, now that fire control was being equipped, <b>air</b> <b>burst</b> rounds were also {{starting to be}} used. With the minesweeping operation mostly completed, American bombardment groups began shelling the city again. The USS New Jersey carried {{out a series of}} attacks at Wonsan and other nearby coastal targets from November 1 to November 6, 1951, during which she targeted the petroleum refinery at Wonsan, trains, bridges, tunnels, railroads, troop concentrations and shore batteries.|$|E
25|$|About 5% of {{the energy}} {{released}} in a nuclear <b>air</b> <b>burst</b> {{is in the form}} of ionizing radiation: neutrons, gamma rays, alpha particles and electrons moving at speeds up to the speed of light. Gamma rays are high energy electromagnetic radiation; the others are particles that move slower than light. The neutrons result almost exclusively from the fission and fusion reactions, while the initial gamma radiation includes that arising from these reactions as well as that resulting from the decay of short-lived fission products.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, {{the initial}} danger from {{concentrated}} local/'early' fallout (which {{takes on the}} color of the soil around the fireball, commonly with a dusty pumice or ash-like appearance, as experienced by the crew of the Lucky Dragon) remains low in a global nuclear war scenario. Instead the fallout most likely to be encountered by most survivors in this scenario {{is expected to be the}} less dangerous but widely spread global/'late' fallout. As an <b>air</b> <b>burst</b> at optimum height will produce a negligible amount of early fallout.|$|E
50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>bursts</b> {{were used}} in the First World War to shower enemy {{positions}} and men with shrapnel balls to kill the largest possible number with a single burst, assuming that the burst was {{directly in front of the}} trench in which the men were positioned.|$|R
5000|$|During the Vietnam War, <b>air</b> <b>bursting</b> shells {{were used}} to great effect to defend US Army bases. This tactic was known as [...] "Killer Junior" [...] when {{referring}} to 105 mm or 155 mm shells, and [...] "Killer Senior" [...] when employed with larger howitzers.|$|R
5000|$|Most of the {{projectiles}} hit {{the coconut}} trees and were <b>air</b> <b>bursts.</b> [...] Jones {{concluded that there}} were no Japanese other than the four patrols of recon Marines already on the ground. Fifteen minutes later, Jones received word that the gunfire would cease and to move the patrols out of the area immediately.|$|R
25|$|No human {{death has}} been {{definitively}} attributed to an impact event, but the 1490 Ch'ing-yang event in which over 10,000 {{people may have}} died {{has been linked to}} a meteor shower. Even asteroids and comets that burn up in the atmosphere can cause significant destruction on the ground due to the <b>air</b> <b>burst</b> explosion – notable air bursts include the Tunguska event in June 1908, which devastated large areas of Siberian countryside, and the Chelyabinsk meteor on 15 February 2013, which caused widespread property damage in the city of Chelyabinsk and injured 1,491.|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{the design}} of the weapon and the {{environment}} in which it is detonated the energy distributed to these categories can be increased or decreased. The blast effect is created by the coupling of immense amounts of energy, spanning the electromagnetic spectrum, with the surroundings. Locations such as submarine, ground burst, <b>air</b> <b>burst,</b> or exo-atmospheric determine how much energy is produced as blast and how much as radiation. In general, denser media around the bomb, like water, absorb more energy, and create more powerful shockwaves {{while at the same time}} limiting the area of its effect.|$|E
25|$|For each goal {{overpressure}} {{there is}} a certain optimum burst height at which the blast range is maximized over ground targets. In a typical <b>air</b> <b>burst,</b> where the blast range is maximized to produce the greatest range of severe damage, i.e. the greatest range that ~ of pressure is extended over, is a GR/ground range of 0.4km for 1 kiloton (kt) of TNT yield; 1.9km for 100 kt; and 8.6km for 10 megatons (Mt) of TNT. The optimum height of burst to maximize this desired severe ground range destruction for a 1 kt bomb is 0.22km; for 100 kt, 1km; and for 10 Mt, 4.7km.|$|E
50|$|In late 1995, {{production}} of the M1114 based on the improved ECV chassis began. The M1114 meets Army requirements for a scout, military police, and explosive ordnance disposal vehicle with improved ballistic protection levels. The M1114 provides protection against 7.62 mm armor-piercing projectiles, 155 mm artillery <b>air</b> <b>bursts</b> and 12 lb anti-tank mine blasts.|$|R
25|$|The next day, she {{departed}} for ammunition. By the afternoon, {{she was back}} in action. Over the following days, she continued her fire support duties, destroying outposts and pillboxes with her secondary battery firing <b>air</b> <b>bursts,</b> mainly off the northeastern shore. On 4 March, she departed the island for the Caroline Islands, reaching Ulithi two days later.|$|R
