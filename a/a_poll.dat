50|$|As {{drivers are}} most often {{implemented}} by a 3rd party, most operating systems also have <b>a</b> <b>polling</b> mode that queries for pending interrupts at fixed intervals or in a round-robin fashion.

When these thresholds are no longer exceeded, an OS may then change the interrupting driver, interrupt, or interrupt handling globally, from an interrupt mode to <b>a</b> <b>polling</b> mode. Interrupt rate limiting in hardware usually negates the use of <b>a</b> <b>polling</b> mode, but can still happen during normal operation during intense I/O if the processor is unable switch contexts quickly enough to keep pace.|$|R
