The presence of the dye indicated that the crack was present <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> detected at a prior inspection. The detection failure arose from poor attention to human factors in United Airlines' specification of maintenance processes.|$|E
5|$|Free-speech advocates {{condemned}} {{the seizure of}} the painting, while the aldermen maintained that the painting was an insult to Washington <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> taken down. Some students at the SAIC showed their support for free speech by holding rallies {{in front of the}} school and at the Richard J. Daley Plaza, while other students criticized Nelson for poor timing in showing a racially insensitive image.|$|E
5|$|On 29 April 1969 the Irish {{parliament}} {{passed the}} Nelson Pillar Act, terminating the Pillar Trust and vesting {{ownership of the}} site in Dublin Corporation. The trustees received £21,170 in compensation for the Pillar's destruction, and a further sum for loss of income. In the debate, Senator Owen Sheehy-Skeffington argued that the Pillar had been capable of repair <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> re-assembled and rebuilt.|$|E

5|$|The First Test was a {{continuation}} of the trend of English batsmen being largely unable to cope with Australia's pacemen. Hutton was the only Englishman to pass 50 in the MCC match, and at Trent Bridge only he and Compton managed this feat. Apart from Hardstaff, none of the remaining batsmen passed 25. Wisden's verdict was that England fought back very well, but that avoiding defeat was almost impossible after their poor batting on the first day. Bowes considered the defensive English bowling display worthy of a draw, and blamed the first innings batting for the failure to prevenet defeat. However, he believed the English tactics to be justified <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> continued.|$|E
5|$|Whitewing was {{the name}} of a special purpose entity used as a {{financing}} method by Enron. In December 1997, with funding of $579 million provided by Enron and $500 million by an outside investor, Whitewing Associates L.P. was formed. Two years later, the entity's arrangement was changed so that it would no longer be consolidated with Enron and be counted on the company's balance sheet. Whitewing was used to purchase Enron assets, including stakes in power plants, pipelines, stocks, and other investments. Between 1999 and 2001, Whitewing bought assets from Enron worth $2 billion, using Enron stock as collateral. Although the transactions were approved by the Enron board, the asset transfers were not true sales <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> treated instead as loans.|$|E
5|$|Captain Hayes, {{unable to}} reach the MTB, had started {{swimming}} away from the shooting, and came ashore beside Asnieres-en-Bessin. He managed to evade capture and made contact with a local French family who provided him with civilian clothing and contacted the French resistance. Hayes was taken by train to Lisieux and after several weeks reached Paris. Hayes was moved along an escape line to the Spanish border, arriving in October 1942. After crossing into Spain he was stopped by Spanish border guards who handed {{him over to the}} Germans. Hayes was returned to Paris and imprisoned in Fresnes prison. He was kept in solitary confinement for nine months before being executed by firing squad on 13 July 1943. Hayes had landed in uniform <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> considered a prisoner of war, but he was executed following the issue of the commando order which called for the execution of all commandos upon capture. It was discovered after the war that Hayes had been betrayed to the Germans, who were aware of all his movements from Normandy to the Spanish border. The persons believed responsible for Hayes' betrayal were never punished, as they convinced the authorities they were acting as double agents.|$|E

25|$|This testing also {{demonstrated}} two unexpected and ultimately very useful {{features of the}} spiral scan system. The first was that since the scanning pattern crossed the ground when the antenna was pointed down, the ground returns produced a series of curved stripes along the lower portion of the display. This formed an analogue of an artificial horizon, one that radar operators found extremely useful in combat because they could immediately see if the pilot was responding correctly to their commands. Various {{members of the team}} record having been surprised by this outcome, noting that the effect was obvious in retrospect <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> predicted.|$|E
25|$|On February 15, {{the game}} was {{released}} in Germany as planned. However, it suffered from numerous bugs, leading to a negative reaction from fans, and criticism of both the game and Blue Byte in the German gaming press. Although Blue Byte issued a patch the same day {{the game was}} released, it introduced additional problems, leading to further negative press. A second patch was released four days later to correct the problems introduced by the first patch. According to German magazine PC Games, 76% of players experienced technical difficulties with the release version of the game. Co-designer Thorsten Mutschall later admitted it had not been ready for release in February <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> held back for additional playtesting and programming.|$|E

On 3 March 1975, she was released as part of the Peter Lorenz kidnapping and exchange together with Rolf Pohle, Verena Becker, Rolf Heissler and Gabriele Kröcher-Tiedemann and ended up in South Yemen. She then lived in a training camp for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PLFP) <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> part of the abduction of the Austrian textile industrial Walter Palmers in November 1977 but was not involved when it was put into action.

This time the chosen location was RAF St Athan, about [...] from Cardiff. St Athan was a large base that also served as an RAF training ground, <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an ideal location.|$|E
500|$|The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum was {{dedicated}} on 20 October 1979. Critics generally liked the finished building, but the architect himself was unsatisfied.

[...] "I wanted to give something very special to the memory of President Kennedy," [...] he said in 2000. [...] "It could <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a great project."

Heather Morris perfectly played up Brittany's innocence and joy surrounding everything Santa. Her interaction with the black mall Santa was a highlight. Watching Artie, and eventually {{the rest of the}} club, work to keep Brittany's belief intact was truly in the spirit of Christmas <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made into a fuller part of the episode. Also shining in this storyline was Dot Jones as Coach Bieste. Her scene as Santa, and then her knowing expression as she watched Artie walk, were the best moments of the episode." [...] In January 2010, Morris and her co-stars won the [...] "Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series. Later that year, Brittany and Santana were nominated for the [...] "Favorite Fictional Lesbian Couple" [...] award at the AfterEllen.com Visibility Awards.|$|E
500|$|Bayern {{president}} Franz Beckenbauer recognised {{that it was}} a loss {{of concentration}} in the last few minutes that led to his side's defeat: [...] "That was the cruellest defeat possible because victory was so close.

We were playing well in the last 20 minutes <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to hold on to victory. But in the end, Manchester deservedly won." [...] Manager Ottmar Hitzfeld seemed more stunned by the result in his reaction: [...] "I feel so sorry for my team because they were so close to winning this match but they have lost. It's really difficult to digest and this is inconceivable for us but then this is what football is all about. Normally when the opposition equalise you are expecting extra-time and it was a shock to our team when they scored the winner two minutes later. It could take days or even weeks to recover from this but I must say that Manchester are great champions." ...|$|E
