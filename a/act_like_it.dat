Ford arrived at training camp well above his playing weight, and rookie Bob Mischak was given Ford's spot in August. [...] When Mischak withdrew from the team, the spot was awarded to another rookie, Paul Wiggin. [...] Ford worked to shed pounds during training camp and worked to train the young defensive players, including Wiggin and Bill Quinlan. Rookie running back Jim Brown recalled that Ford pulled him aside during the 1957 training camp and gave him advice on dealing with the Browns' head coach Paul Brown. [...] Ford advised the rookie to {{keep his mouth shut}} and do as the coach set during practice and waiting until game day: [...] "Run it your way in the game and hope it works, and if it does, don't say anything.

500|$|The episode's plot {{involved}} {{the death of}} former boss Ed Truck, a character who had been played by Ken Howard in the second-season episode [...] "The Carpet". As part of the episode took place outdoors, the cast had to wear coats despite the hot summer weather. Actress Kate Flannery commented in a weekly blog she wrote for TV Guide that [...] "we suffered while shooting the outdoor scenes... We had to <b>act</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was cold when it was warm. For hours and hours. You would never know it by looking at us. Isn't that crazy?" [...] Flannery also wrote, [...] "I love this episode because it's dark, for a comedy. This time The Office tackles gutsy subject matter." [...] In her memoir Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, Mindy Kaling wrote that the episode resulted in the worst disagreement she ever had during her years on the show, where she and Greg Daniels, normally a [...] "very nice" [...] person, disagreed on a story point {{to the extent that}} Daniels told her that if [...] "you [...] going to resist what I'm doing here, you can just go home." [...] Kaling briefly left the set before returning, with no further problems or repercussions noted.|$|E
500|$|In late 2004, {{the group}} {{performed}} [...] "Soldier" [...] with T.I. during MTV's Total Request Live (TRL). At BET's 106 & Park Destiny's Child performed [...] "Soldier" [...] on November 15, 2004. At {{the beginning of}} the performance, Michelle Williams fell onstage during the group's entrance. Williams addressed the incident during an interview in 2014, saying, [...] "I {{had no choice but to}} get up and <b>act</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> didn't happen. Because of YouTube – 10 years later, at least once a week, somebody brings it to my attention." [...] She added that it would be the last time she discussed the incident and acknowledged that although [...] "it lives on forever" [...] a lot of [...] "great things" [...] have happened to her since then. On November 16, 2004 another performance of the song was during the television show Good Morning America. Destiny's Child appeared on CBS The Early Show on December 8, 2004 and sang [...] "Soldier". The group performed the song again in early February 2005 at the British show Top of the Pops. At the 2005 NBA All-Star Game on February 20, 2005 they sang [...] "Soldier" [...] and [...] "Lose My Breath". Destiny's Child also performed [...] "Soldier" [...] during the concert Rockin' the Corps in April 2005 with the performance being featured on a DVD.|$|E

500|$|Sean Kinney {{said about}} the new album and the fans' mixed {{reactions}} about the band moving on after Staley's death: [...] "Look, it’s a big move to fucking stand up and move on. Some people, the music connected with them so strongly, their opinions, {{how they feel about}} it... It’s amazing that they have such a connection but they seem to <b>act</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> happened to them. This happened to us and Layne’s family, not them. This is actually our lives. If we’re okay with it, why can’t you be? This happened to us, this didn’t happen to you. But this album isn’t about that, it’s a bigger universal point. We’re all going to fucking die, we’re all going to lose somebody, and it fucking hurts. How do you move on? This record is us moving on, and hurting. That, to me, is a victory. I already feel like I’ve won." [...] "Sometimes people ask us, ‘Wouldn’t Layne have been pissed off that we did this?’ And I tell them {{it would have been the}} opposite: he would have been pissed off that it took us so long to do this. We’re not doing this for money; there is no money in the music business anymore. Jerry and I funded the whole album, and we spent lots of our own money, because we believe in this. And one of the reasons I’m doing this is so more light is turned on to something where the light was turned off." [...] And Cantrell added: [...] "We’ve toured around the world, we’ve lost some friends, we buried a dear friend, and somebody that you just can’t fucking replace, and then we’ve chosen by circumstance to get together again. That turned into ‘maybe we can fucking do this.’ And that turned into this".|$|E

Mamma is dead set against the artistic, and I'm dead set against the fashionable. As long as I'm at the Synthesis, I do as the Synthetics do. I dress like the Synthesis, and I think like it, and I <b>act</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> As soon as I get home in the afternoon, I have to be of the world worldly. I put on a Worth frock, and mamma would make me put on a Worth spirit, if she could. I do my best to conform, because it's the bargain, and I'll keep my word if it kills me. Now you see what a double life I lead! If I could only be steeped in hopeless poverty to the lips! If I could have a room like this, even! Sometimes I'm so bewildered by the twofold existence I'm leading, I don't really know what I'm saying. Those your things, of course?" [...] She sprang from Cornelia's trunk, which she had sank down upon again, and swiftly traversed the sketches Cornelia had pinned about the wall. [...] "What touch! Yes, you merely have to live on, to be anything you like. It'll do itself for you. Well, I suppose you'll have to see her." [...] She turned about to Cornelia with an air of deprecation. [...] "Mamma, you know. She's down stairs waiting for us. She thinks it right to come with me always. I dare say it is. She isn't so very bad, you know. Only she insists upon knowing all the girls I take a fancy to, herself. You needn't be afraid of her." ...|$|E

50|$|Faerber {{explained}} that his {{inspiration for the}} series came from a conversation with editor Andy Helfer, {{in which he was}} asked what made the Teen Titans unique. When Faerber opined that the Titans were like a family, Helfer pointed out that all superhero teams could be described as such. From this, Faerber devised a team that was a biological family but did not <b>act</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> Another influence, he said, was his parents' divorce.|$|E

ExpressCard 2.0 adds SuperSpeed USB as another type of interface the card can use. Unfortunately, CardBus and ExpressCard are vulnerable to DMA attack unless the laptop has an IOMMU that is configured to thwart these attacks.|$|R
