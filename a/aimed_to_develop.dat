5|$|LIFE, {{short for}} Laser Inertial Fusion Energy, was a fusion energy effort run at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory between 2008 and 2013. LIFE <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> the {{technologies}} necessary {{to convert the}} laser-driven inertial confinement fusion concept being developed in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) into a practical commercial power plant, a concept known generally as inertial fusion energy (IFE). Two designs were considered, operated as either a pure fusion or hybrid fusion-fission system. LIFE used the same basic concepts as NIF, but aimed to lower costs using mass-produced fuel elements, simplified maintenance, and diode lasers with higher electrical efficiency.|$|E
5|$|In 1965 Constantine {{became a}} {{founding}} member of the Sports Council, which <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> sport in Britain. Two years later, he was appointed to the three-person Race Relations Board, formed through the Race Relations Act, to investigate cases of racial discrimination. In this role he spoke out against the Commonwealth Immigrants Act, a stance that led to an offer from the Liberal Party, which he declined, to stand as parliamentary candidate for Nelson. Later, he was involved in an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate the release, after a military coup, of Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, the overthrown Prime Minister of Nigeria. Constantine was appointed to the BBC's General Advisory Committee in 1966 and became a BBC Governor two years later, although declining health restricted his involvement. The following year the students of St Andrews University elected Constantine as Rector, but again his health prevented him performing effectively in this role. In his last years, Constantine was criticised for becoming part of the Establishment; Private Eye mocked him, while the new generation of West Indian immigrants believed he was out of touch. More radical black spokesmen disapproved of his conciliatory approach to racist incidents.|$|E

25|$|Dual Technique Magnetometer (MAG): The MAG is {{a direct}} sensing {{instrument}} that measures the strength {{and direction of the}} magnetic field around Saturn. The magnetic fields are generated partly by the molten core at Saturn's center. Measuring the magnetic field is one of the ways to probe the core. MAG <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> a three-dimensional model of Saturn's magnetosphere, and determine the magnetic state of Titan and its atmosphere, and the icy satellites and their role in the magnetosphere of Saturn.|$|E

The Sudarshan kit incorporates laser guidance developed by ADE for 450kg (1000 pound) bombs to improve the accuracy of a conventional bomb. The guidance consists of a computer control group (CCG), canards attached {{to the front of}} the warhead for steering and a wing assembly attached to the rear end to provide lift.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{large number}} of Aboriginal rock {{paintings}} and carvings along the stock route. As more and more people visit the area each year, custodians of the Western Desert have become concerned about the protection and management of Aboriginal sites along the route. In 2007, researchers from the Australian National University began a project to draw up the first comprehensive plan of management for the entire Canning Stock Route. The project <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> a series of modules to inform detailed guides and signs for visitors, while also protecting sites that have special significance for Indigenous peoples.|$|E

25|$|MH-1A was {{the first}} {{floating}} nuclear power station. Named Sturgis after General Samuel D. Sturgis, Jr., this pressurized water reactor built in a converted Liberty ship {{was part of a}} series of reactors in the US Army Nuclear Power Program, which <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> small nuclear reactors to generate electrical and space-heating energy primarily at remote, relatively inaccessible sites. Its designation stood for mobile, high power. After its first criticality in 1967, MH-1A was towed to the Panama Canal Zone that it supplied with 10 MW of electricity from October 1968 to 1975. Its dismantling was started in 2014 and it is anticipated to be completed in under four years.|$|E
25|$|The {{children}} ministry, more popularly called “Kids@111” {{in reference}} to the address of CCBC, is a service that nurtures the children of the church ranging from 2 years to 12 years of age. Specifically, the ministry aims to impart the word of God to children so that they become knowledgeable in and obedient to the faith by the time they reach adolescence. The ministry further believes in the value of every child, recognizes the need to develop their talents, and envisions them as future leaders. To fulfill its mission and vision, the ministry engages in several activities <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> children. Among these are Sunday school classes, vacation bible classes, arts and crafts, environmental awareness programs, and parent-child interactions.|$|E
25|$|Gleizes {{and others}} decide {{to create an}} {{association}} fraternelle d'artistes and rent a large house in Créteil. The Abbaye de Créteil was a self-supporting community of artists that <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> their art free of any commercial concerns. For nearly a year, Gleizes along with other painters, poets, musicians and writers, gathered to create. A lack of income forced them {{to give up their}} cherished Abbaye de Créteil in early 1908 and Gleizes moved to rue du Delta near Montmartre, Paris. In 1908 Gleizes exhibited at the Toison d'Or in Moscow. The same year, showing a great interest in color and reflecting the transient influence of Fauvism, the work of Gleizes became more synthetic with a proto-Cubist component.|$|E

25|$|The Lucknow gharana of Kathak dance {{attributes}} {{its origins}} to a rural Krishna devotee named Ishwari {{from the village}} in southeast Uttar Pradesh, who <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> Kathak dance {{as a form of}} loving devotion to Krishna. This school thrived after the Mughal Empire collapsed, when Kathak artists moved from Delhi to Lucknow under the sponsorship of Avadh nawabs who favored court dance culture. In the modern era, the Lucknow gharana style influences the dance school in New Delhi with Shambu Maharaj, Birju Maharaj and Lacchu Maharaj. Kathak choreography there has developed themes beyond Krishna-Radha, such as those based on the drama works of Kalidasa's Shiva-Parvati and Bhavabhuti's Malati-Madhav. This school has also attempted a Hindu-Muslim Kathak fusion style, highlighting the court dancers theme.|$|E
25|$|By 1964, in {{the face}} of the superiority of tractors, the {{breeding}} of the heavy warmblood had completely collapsed. Stallions covered 10% of the mares that they had 20 years before. This scene played out in the 1950s and 60's throughout German horse breeding. During this time, though, increasing leisure time meant that horses soon found their modern cultural niche: recreational riding. The breeders of Ostfriesland <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> their horses along this path, producing a lighter riding horse with all the economical traits that had made them popular before. Fearing that the Thoroughbred would detract from the amenable nature of their horses, the Ostfriesen breeders chose to use Arabian blood instead. Beginning in 1948, such stallions were made available to the breeders, who scarcely used them, being hard-put to change their beloved horses so drastically. However, the evidence was convincing, as the Freisen-Arabs were horses of excellent character, great capacity and riding quality. Unfortunately, they had missed the mark: the market demanded a light, elegant, but tall riding horses, and the Freisen-Arabs were smaller than their warmblood mothers. Limited in their competitiveness in dressage and jumping, the Freisen-Arabs did not sell, and the Ostfriesen horses seemed doomed to extinction.|$|E

The producers had the Maquis introduced in other Star Trek series before Voyager in four episodes; two in [...] and two in Deep Space Nine. It was a deliberate reference to the political situation in the West Bank.|$|E
500|$|Gambino was {{selected}} in the 1945 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears in the 26th round as the 271st overall pick. In 1946, he was discharged from the Army and enrolled at the University of Maryland. He considered Indiana to be a far superior football program and called Maryland a [...] "cow school," [...] but it was located relatively close to his mother, who was widowed and living alone in Baltimore. During the 1946 season, Gambino saw limited playing time for a mediocre Terrapins football team directed by head coach Clark Shaughnessy. The following year, head coach Jim Tatum was hired, and he engineered {{a reversal of the}} team's fortunes. Tatum took the mentorship of Gambino as a personal project and <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> him into the team's featured back.|$|E
500|$|The park's {{land was}} {{gradually}} {{acquired by the}} Government of South Australia beginning in 1966, based on recommendations in a 1962 report. From 1981 onwards, plans were published that <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> the area for commercial purposes, but public pressure led to its declaration as a public reserve in 1989. The last land added was a small area in 2003. Anstey Hill is a [...] peak in the park's south. Both hill and park are named after a road built by agricultural pioneer George Alexander Anstey. Fire authorities regard the park as an [...] "arson hotspot", and it is frequently burned by bushfiresmostly deliberately lit. There is no permanent water except for springs in Water Gully, adjacent to ruins of a nursery, {{although there are many}} seasonal creeks. Much of the land is steep, rising [...] across the park's breadth, with gradients often steeper than one in three. Erosion and land movements due to a significant geologic fault zone created this land form. The Gun Emplacement, a listed Geologic Monument and remnant of an ancient land surface, lies in the southwestern corner.|$|E

During design, the development team created larger areas that could be explored more thoroughly as Raziel acquired new powers, avoiding the [...] "shallow" [...] of Blood Omens layout. Crystal Dynamics based Soul Reaver on Silicon Knights' research of vampire mythology for Blood Omen. Other aspects of the game, such as {{the idea of a}} fallen vampire who devoured souls, were inspired by the epic poem [...] "Paradise Lost". The staff <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> gameplay similar to Tomb Raider and used an upgraded version of Gex 3s game engine to generate the three-dimensional game world. According to Richard Lemarchand, they also aimed to combine gameplay with storytelling in a similar manner to [...] Amy Hennig, the game's director, likened the technological advance from Blood Omen to Soul Reaver to the evolution of The Legend of Zelda series from the Super Nintendo to the Nintendo 64—bringing the franchise into 3D while maintaining a similar style.|$|E
500|$|For {{their fourth}} album, the band changed label from Epitaph to Columbia Records. The band signed a multiple-album deal months before {{releasing}} their previous album. Following the move, the guitarist Joshua Cain said, [...] "It just felt {{right to make}} the move when there was the right interest there." [...] With the new signing, the band's promotional team <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> {{a balance between the}} benefits of a new major label and their previous grass-roots approach. The album saw the band reunite with producer Mark Hoppus, and the album was mostly recorded at his studio in North Hollywood, Opra Music between April and June 2009. Hoppus said that the band wanted to follow in the tracks of Commit This to Memory, but to push things further. Pierre later recalled that the atmosphere in the studio was more loose than their first time working with Hoppus. The band picked the title My Dinosaur Life after a quote Pierre kept repeating—they felt it a nice representation of the album's themes, which include growing old and feeling out of place. After completing the album, the band toured with Blink-182 on their reunion tour, and Pierre undertook a promotional tour called On the Dino Trail wherein he performed acoustic sets.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} team decided that, as with And Then There Were None, {{they would}} change Christie's original ending for Murder on the Orient Express. The {{aim of the}} developers was to create games that would not only appeal to casual gamers, but also to Christie fans. As nearly all Christie fans have read Murder on the Orient Express, and know the solution, and considering that the novel was to be included with the game, the developers decided that the ending needed to be changed. The novel has two solutions [...] one being {{what appears to be}} happening and the other being what is actually occurring [...] and the developers <b>aimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> a third solution which drew on these two solutions and still surprised the player. Lee Sheldon admitted that his variation to the ending of And Then There Were None received some criticism, and said that in Murder on the Orient Express changing the ending was even harder because of the sheer fame of the book and its solution. He also expressed his hatred of adaptations of older material which make fun of that time period, and said {{that he was trying to}} stay as faithful to Christie's work and time era as possible.|$|E
