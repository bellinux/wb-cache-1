5|$|After {{the liberation}} of Ethiopia, Emperor Haile Selassie I asked the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to help him to {{establish}} an airline {{as part of his}} modernisation effort. According to the BBC News {{it is possible that the}} Emperor intended the creation of a quality national airline to help dispel impressions of Ethiopian poverty. In 1945, the Ethiopian government began negotiations with both Transcontinental Air Transport and Western <b>Air</b> <b>Express</b> (later merged into TWA). On 8 September 1945, TWA signed an agreement with the American historian and foreign affairs advisor to Ethiopia John H. Spencer to establish a commercial aviation company in Ethiopia.|$|E
5|$|Prior to McCarran Airport, {{the first}} airport to serve Las Vegas was Anderson Field, opened in November 1920 {{southeast}} of present-day Sahara Ave and Paradise Rd.

5|$|Finnair {{terminated}} {{their services}} to Kirkenes in 1975. At {{the same time}} the ministry and SAS started looking at the airport structure in Finnmark, as all the services in the county were in need of subsidies.

SAS was flying a 90-seat aircraft two to three times per day between Kirkenes and Alta with only ten to fifteen passengers. The airport structure was kept, but ticket prices continued to rise. The airport served 110,000 passengers in 1983. Norving continued Varangfly's air ambulance contract until 1987, when the service was taken over by <b>Air</b> <b>Express.</b> Later the contract was awarded to Lufttransport, who operated the Beechcraft Super King Air.
