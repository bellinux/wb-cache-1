500|$|Marion Cotillard plays [...] "Mal" [...] Cobb, Dom Cobb's {{projection}} of his guilt over his deceased wife's suicide. As the film's main antagonist, {{she is a}} frequent, malevolent presence in his dreams. Dom is unable to control these projections of her, challenging his abilities as an extractor. Nolan described Mal as [...] "the essence of the femme fatale", the key noir reference in the film. As a [...] "classic femme fatale" [...] her relationship with Cobb is in his mind, a manifestation of Cobb's own neurosis and fear of how little he knows <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> he loves. DiCaprio praised Cotillard's performance saying that [...] "she can be strong and vulnerable and hopeful and heartbreaking {{all in the same}} moment, which was perfect for all the contradictions of her character".|$|E
500|$|Her {{literary}} career got a boost {{after she}} sent {{a copy of}} Éparpillements to Remy de Gourmont, a French poet, literary critic, and philosopher who had become a recluse after contracting the disfiguring disease lupus vulgaris in his thirties. He was impressed enough to invite her {{to one of the}} Sunday gatherings at his home, at which he usually received only a small group of old friends. [...] She was a rejuvenating influence in his life, coaxing him out for evening car rides, dinners at the Rue Jacob, a masked ball, even a short cruise on the Seine. [...] He turned some of their wide-ranging conversations into a series of letters that he published in the Mercure de France, addressing her as l'Amazone, a French word that can mean either horsewoman or Amazon; the letters were later collected in book form. [...] He died in 1915, but the nickname he gave her would stay with her all her life—even her tombstone identifies her as [...] "the Amazon of Remy de Gourmont"—and his Letters to the Amazon left readers wanting to know more <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> who had inspired them.|$|E

Jamie spends time with her mother, Lorna, while Dylan discusses it with Annie over the phone. His sister informs him that their father will be flying to Newark and he needs to be picked up at the airport. While at the airport, his father, in a moment of Alzheimer's-induced confusion, incorrectly recognizes a passer-by as a woman from his past. Dylan asks him <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman.</b> After regaining his lucidity, his father says that she was a woman he met in the Navy and [...] "the love of my life".

Series' creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey had seen Jackson in the Broadway musicals Xanadu and Damn Yankees, the latter that starred Jane Krakowski, who plays Jenna on the show. According to Jackson in a November 2009 interview, Fey set up a meeting to interest him in a role on the program.

[...] Scholars have developed a few possibilities for the identity of Mr. W.H., such as William Herbert and Henry Wriothesley. Critics have also wondered <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> who came between Shakespeare and the boy: [...] "And of course there is the dark lady, identified alternatively as a nameless aristocrat, a commoner, Queen Elizabeth, her maid of honor Mary Fitton, the London prostitute Lucy Negro, the poet Aemilia Lanyer, and so on." ...|$|E

2500|$|Licinia (flourished 1st century BC), who was {{supposedly}} courted by her kinsman, the so-called [...] "triumvir" [...] Marcus Licinius Crassus, who in fact wanted her property. This relationship {{gave rise to}} rumors. Plutarch says: [...] "And yet when he was further on in years, {{he was accused of}} criminal intimacy with Licinia, one of the Vestal virgins and Licinia was formally prosecuted by a certain Plotius. Now Licinia was the owner of a pleasant villa in the suburbs which Crassus wished to get at a low price, and it was for this reason that he was forever hovering <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> and paying his court to her, until he fell under the abominable suspicion. And in a way it was his avarice that absolved him from the charge of corrupting the Vestal, and he was acquitted by the judges. But he did not let Licinia go until he had acquired her property." [...] Licinia became a Vestal in 85 BC and remained a Vestal until 61 BC.|$|E

[...] After the lecture, he noticed his friend, the future author Humphry Ward, talking to an unfamiliar {{young woman who was}} wearing a yellow scarf. [...] Yellow was Creighton's favourite colour; the scarf aroused his interest enough for him to ask Ward <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> whose name was Louise von Glehn. [...] Soon Ward was inviting Creighton and von Glehn to a Valentine's Day lunch hosted in his rooms in Brasenose College. [...] In a few weeks, von Glenn found herself won over by Creighton's charm, and before she left Oxford {{at the end of the}} month, the two were engaged. [...] They had agreed to be married the following winter; however, as Christmas approached, it was still not certain whether Merton College would waive its requirement of celibacy for its teaching fellows. [...] On Christmas Eve, the college finally relented and elected four married fellows, one of whom was Creighton. [...] Von Glehn and Creighton were married on 8 January 1872 in her home town of Sydenham, Kent. [...] They spent a week [...] honeymooning in Paris before returning to Oxford for Creighton's new teaching term.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{discussions with}} the family are {{complete}} and satisfactory information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> is acquired then {{the family of the}} man will proceed to appoint marriage negotiators. It is these very negotiators that will travel to the family of the woman to make known the man and his intentions. Once the negotiators reach the family of the woman they will be kept in the kraal, inkundla, of the woman's family. If the family do not possess a kraal they will simply be kept outside the household as they {{will not be allowed to}} enter the household without the acknowledgement and acceptance of the woman's family. It is here where the lobola (dowry) negotiations will begin. The family of the woman will give them a bride-price and a date for which they must return to pay that price. The bride-price is dependent on numerous things such as her level of education, the wealth status of her family in comparison to that of the man's family, what the man stands to gain in the marriage and the overall desirability of the woman. The payment of the bride-price could be in either cattle or money depending on the family of the woman. The modern Xhosa families would rather prefer money as most are situated in the urban cities where there would be no space nor permits for livestock.|$|E
