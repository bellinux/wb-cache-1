The model consisted of a 4 mm borehole, 1. 5 cm distal of the major trochanter in both femurs of a rabbit, of which one {{was filled with a}} cylinder of porous PA. The other was left untreated. PA 70 / 30 and PA 60 / 40 were investigated, both before and after being incubated with <b>allogenic</b> bone <b>marrow.</b> Analyses were performed after 4, 8, 26 and 52 weeks and comprised dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and image analysis of histological sections. DXA revealed an increased bone mineral density in the filled defects compared to the controls, both at the defect and immediately proximal and distal of the defect. Histology showed that gap-bridging had occurred within 8 weeks, with 80 %- 90 % of the pores of PA 70 / 30 and PA 60 / 40 occupied by new bone, and an intimate bone-PA contact. PA 70 / 30 seemed to be more suitable compared to PA 60 / 40, in that the highest amount of bone was formed with in the shortest period of time.

30|$|Although the seeding cells (MSCs or osteoblasts induced from MSCs) were allogenic, {{this study}} succeeded in forming new bone tissue without {{immunological}} rejection (as determined by histological examination). It {{was reported that}} MSCs have a highly reduced immunoreactivity in allogenic transfer [22, 23, 24] {{and the results of}} this study confirm this again. In addition, it was shown that whilst the MSCs can survive and form bone tissue in an allogenic environment, the osteoblasts induced from MSCs still maintain the low-immunogenicity character of parent MSCs. This result holds potential for manufacturing tissue-engineered implants using <b>allogenic</b> bone <b>marrow</b> mesenchymal stem cells, which are free from immunological rejection. It also suggests that mature cellular lineages induced from these MSCs will have a low immunogenicity and opens the way for studying allogenic somatic mature cells transfers, an area which has always been impractical owing to the barrier of immunological rejection.|$|R

40|$|Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is an {{important}} problem following <b>allogenic</b> bone <b>marrow</b> transplantation (BMT). The beneficial effects of photochemotherapy with psoralens plus UVA irradiation (PUVA) have been described repeatedly; however, PUVA is limited by {{a wide range of}} unwanted effects. A novel improved form of UV-B phototherapy, narrowband UV-B, has been proven to be very effective in T-cell mediated dermatoses. Therefore, we investigated the effect of narrowband UV-B phototherapy (5 times per week) in 10 patients with cutaneous GVHD (grade 2 - 3) resistant to standard immunosuppressive drugs. It was tolerated well by all patients, and no side effects were observed. Skin lesions showed complete clearance in 7 out of 10 patients within 3 to 5 weeks. 3 patients showed significant improvement of GVHD. We suggest that narrowband UV-B phototherapy is a nonaggressive treatment that may benefit patients with cutaneous GVHD who already take high doses of immunosuppressive drugs...|$|R

For patient  4, based on examination and ancillary testing, it was most likely that she had primary MFC rather than OHS or toxoplasmosis. We decided to monitor the patient and would begin IMT treatment to decrease the risk of recurrent inflammation if active choroiditis or recurrent CNV reappeared. In addition, VEGF antagonist would be employed as needed to provide rapid control of any recurrent CNV.|$|R
40|$|Multiple myeloma {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{malignancies}} encountered in clinical practice. Renal involvement in myeloma is a well-recognized entity. Although rare, another special situation that a nephrologist can encounter is myeloma occurring in a patient with preexisting chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to other etiologies. Anemia, bone pains and hypercalcemia, which commonly indicate the diagnosis of myeloma in the general population, are not useful in the presence of CKD. The sensitivity and specificity of serum free light chain assay is decreased in the presence of renal failure. Chemotherapy-related adverse effects are high compared with that in patients without CKD; this is attributed to the decreased clearance of drugs and the additive effect of chemotherapy-related adverse effects to the complications of CKD.
