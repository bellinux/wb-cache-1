5|$|Shortly after Ferrier's death {{an appeal}} was {{launched}} by Barbirolli, Walter, Myra Hess and others, {{to establish a}} cancer research fund in Ferrier's name. Donations were received {{from all over the}} world. To publicise the fund a special concert was given at the Royal Festival Hall on 7 May 1954, at which Barbirolli and Walter shared the conducting duties without payment. Among the items was a rendition of Purcell's When I am laid in earth, which Ferrier had often sung; on this occasion the vocal part was played by a solo cor <b>anglais.</b> The Kathleen Ferrier Cancer Research Fund helped establish the Kathleen Ferrier Chair of Clinical Oncology at University College Hospital, in 1984. , it was continuing to fund oncology research.|$|E

5|$|In 15–16th-century French and English {{depictions of}} {{relationships}} between women (Lives of Gallant Ladies by Brantôme in 1665, John Cleland's 1749 erotica Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure, L'Espion <b>Anglais</b> by various authors in 1778), writers' attitudes spanned from amused tolerance to arousal, whereupon a male character would participate to complete the act. Physical relationships between women were often encouraged; men felt no threat as they viewed sexual acts between women to be accepted when men were not available, and not comparable to fulfillment that could be achieved by sexual acts between men and women. At worst, if a woman became enamored of another woman, she became a tragic figure. Physical and therefore emotional satisfaction was considered impossible without a natural phallus. Male intervention into relationships between women was necessary only when women acted as men and demanded the same social privileges.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} pieces for the Bouffes-Parisiens, {{the size of}} the {{orchestra}} pit had restricted Offenbach to an orchestra of 16 players. He composed for flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, two horns, piston, trombone, timpani and percussion and a small string section of seven players. After moving to the Salle Choiseul he had an orchestra of 30 players. The musicologist and Offenbach specialist Jean-Christophe Keck notes that when larger orchestras were available, either in bigger Paris theatres or in Vienna or elsewhere, Offenbach would compose, or rearrange existing music, accordingly. Surviving scores show his instrumentation for additional wind and brass, and even extra percussion. When they were available he wrote for cor <b>anglais,</b> harp, and, exceptionally, Keck records, an ophicleide (Le Papillon), tubular bells (Le carnaval des revues), and a wind machine (Le voyage dans la lune).|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 18th century, Paris has been {{famous for its}} {{restaurants}} and haute cuisine, food meticulously prepared and artfully presented. A luxury restaurant, La Taverne Anglaise, opened in 1786 in the arcades of the Palais-Royal by Antoine Beauvilliers; it featured an elegant dining room, an extensive menu, linen tablecloths, a large wine list and well-trained waiters; it became a model for future Paris restaurants. The restaurant Le Grand Véfour in the Palais-Royal dates from the same period. The famous Paris restaurants of the 19th century, including the Café de Paris, the Rocher de Cancale, the Café <b>Anglais,</b> Maison Dorée and the Café Riche, were mostly located near the theatres on the Boulevard des Italiens; they were immortalised in the novels of Balzac and Émile Zola. Several of the best-known restaurants in Paris today appeared during the Belle Epoque, including Maxim's on Rue Royale, Ledoyen in the gardens of the Champs-Élysées, and the Tour d'Argent on the Quai de la Tournelle.|$|E
5|$|After the Reformation, and the {{departure}} of the Scottish court in 1603, artists and artisans looked to secular patronage and estate houses became repositories of art and of elaborate furnishings. Estate houses were adorned with paintings, wood carvings and plasterwork. The Grand Tour encouraged the collection of classical art and the adoption of classical styles for new works that were incorporated into the Adam Style. The Baronial revival resulted a synthesised Victorian style that combined elements of the Renaissance, symbols of landed power and national affiliation with modern fittings. From the late sixteenth century, many estate houses were surrounded by gardens influenced by Italian Renaissance gardens. From the late seventeenth century the formal gardens at Versailles and Dutch gardens were important models. In the eighteenth century less formal and symmetrical layouts became common with the development of the jardin <b>anglais.</b> In the nineteenth century there was a return of the formal garden near to the house. The development of the Palladian country house in the seventeenth century separated the family of the householder from the servants. Gentry families spent much of their time visiting family, friends or neighbours and hospitality was an important part of life. Major activities included hunting, cards, chess and music. Large and sumptuous meals were an important part of social life. In the eighteenth century, estate houses were designed as centres of public display, but in the nineteenth century they became increasingly private and developed distinct male areas.|$|E

25|$|Le Pont aux <b>Anglais,</b> soleil couchant is an oil {{painting}} on canvas in a horizontal format with dimensions 54 x 73cm (21.25 by 28.75 in), signed R Pinchon lower left. The composition painted en plein air (sur le motif, {{in the open}} air), {{is dominated by the}} Pont aux <b>Anglais,</b> Rouen, with receding perspective tending towards {{the right side of the}} canvas. A locomotive and train cars pass over the bridge leaving a trail of steam in the direction of the receding perspective, carrying the eye towards the right, where below, a boat passes carrying two people a short distance from Le Pont aux <b>Anglais.</b> The rhythmic arches of the bridge and the speeding train create a sense of dynamism and modernity not often found in Post-Impressionist works. The colors Pinchon has chosen to depict this late afternoon scene are both warm and cool. The golden yellow highlights generated by the setting sun, off the canvas to the left, are juxtaposed against the grays, blues, violets and greens of the background hillside, the bridge and its massive base pillars, the poplar trees and the River Seine in the foreground.|$|E

25|$|Le Pont aux <b>Anglais,</b> soleil couchant is an oil {{painting}} created in 1905 by the French artist Robert Antoine Pinchon (1886–1943). Associated {{with the new}} generation of l'École de Rouen Pinchon executed this work in a Post-Impressionist style with a subdued Fauve or Neo-Impressionist palette of golden yellows and incandescent blues. The dynamic image of the train in Pinchon's painting is an homage to the emerging industrialized world.|$|E
25|$|A {{week after}} the attack, the anti-terror {{directorate}} of the National Police (SDAT) requested that the local authorities in Nice destroy CCTV footage of the attack, arguing that leaked images would compromise the dignity of victims and {{could be used as}} propaganda by terrorist organizations. The request has been refused by local authorities who have argued that the CCTV footage might provide evidence that the National Police had placed inadequate security measures on the Promenade des <b>Anglais</b> on 14 July.|$|E
25|$|Lahouaiej-Bouhlel's mobile phone, {{found in}} the truck after he was shot by police, gave police {{information}} about his preparations. On 12 and 13 July 2016, Bouhlel returned several times to the Promenade des <b>Anglais,</b> {{the site of the}} attack, surveying the area in the rented truck. On 12 July, he took some selfies on the Promenade, as Molins confirmed on 18 July. Lahouaiej-Bouhlel's brother said he received images of Lahouaiej-Bouhlel laughing among the holiday crowds in Nice hours before the attack.|$|E

25|$|Robert Antoine Pinchon's {{first solo}} {{exhibition}} in Paris {{took place on}} 1525 March 1909 at the Galerie des Artistes Modernes run by Chaine and Simonson, with thirty works listed in the catalogue. The show resulted in both sales and press coverage. This was followed by another show at the Galerie Legrip in Rouen on 30 June. A few months later, on 13 November, the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen, opened a show with fifty-two paintings: three by Claude Monet, nine by Alfred Sisley, three by Armand Guillaumin, one by Auguste Renoir, thirteen by Albert Lebourg, five by Joseph Delattre, two by Charles Frechon and four by Robert Antoine Pinchon (now almost twenty-three years old); Péniches dans la brume, Vue pris du Mont-Garan, Effet de neige, and Le Pont aux <b>Anglais,</b> soleil couchant.|$|E
25|$|Martine's former suitor, Lorens, now {{a famous}} general {{married to a}} member of the Queen's court, comes as the guest of his aunt, the local lady of the manor {{and a member of the}} old pastor's congregation. He is unaware of the other guests' austere plans, and as a man of the world and former attaché in Paris, he is the only person at the table {{qualified}} to comment on the meal. He regales the guests with abundant information about the extraordinary food and drink, comparing it to a meal he enjoyed years earlier at the famous Café <b>Anglais</b> in Paris. Although the other celebrants refuse to comment on the earthly pleasures of their meal, Babette's gifts break down their distrust and superstitions, elevating them physically and spiritually. Old wrongs are forgotten, ancient loves are rekindled, and a mystical redemption of the human spirit settles over the table.|$|E
25|$|At 6:00 pm, the 6th Foot and the Brunswick Oels {{from the}} brigade of Edward Barnes {{arrived on the}} {{battlefield}} from the west. Marching along the western extension of the Chemin des <b>Anglais,</b> these 1,500 soldiers struck Maransin's division from an unexpected direction. The battalion of the 103rd Line Infantry was badly mauled, losing 15 out of 20 officers. The 82nd Foot and the survivors of Cameron's brigade rallied {{and returned to the}} attack, pushing Maransin's surprised soldiers uphill. Finally, D'Erlon threw in one of Abbé's fresh brigades and Maransin's troops rallied behind it. The French corps commander also recalled one of Darmagnac's brigades which had gone in pursuit of Pringle's brigade. Fearing that he was confronted by two full divisions, d'Erlon refused to commit Abbé's division to an attack. The battle petered out about 8:00 pm with the French in possession of Maya Pass, but with the British in position nearby.|$|E
25|$|Before Matthew moved ashore, a sick woman died in Port-Salut {{due to high}} storm tides {{preventing}} her {{travel to}} a hospital, and a man was missing {{as a result of}} a boat wreck. Hurricane Matthew proved deadly for the country; one day after the storm made landfall, there were five known fatalities related to the storm, which rose to 108 by October6, including 50people killed in the coastal town of Roche-à-Bateaux. The death toll increased sharply to 842 by the next day, once the hardest hit areas of the Tiburon Peninsula were reached; many of the fatalities were due to people refusing to evacuate and who were trapped beneath the rubble of destroyed houses. This included 264deaths in Sud, of whom 158 died in Les <b>Anglais</b> where Matthew moved ashore. There were at least 500fatalities in Grand'Anse, and nationwide as many as 1,600unconfirmed deaths. These numbers were lower according to the Haitian government, which reported a death toll of 546 as of October15.|$|E
25|$|Tropical Storm Matthew {{developed}} on September28 from a tropical wave {{moving through the}} southern Lesser Antilles. Low wind shear and warm waters favored strengthening, and the storm intensified into a hurricane on September29. Early on October1, following a period of rapid deepening, Matthew reached Category5 on the Saffir–Simpson scale, with peak sustained winds of 270km/h (165mph) while north of the Colombia coast. Upwelling of cooler waters subsequently caused Matthew to weaken to a Category4 hurricane. By October3, the hurricane was moving northward through the Caribbean around the western periphery of a large ridge, while maintaining Category4 intensity. On the next day, Matthew re-intensified to attain a minimum central pressure of , along with winds of 240km/h (150mph) around its well-defined eye. On October4 at 11:00UTC, the storm made landfall on the Tiburon Peninsula of southwestern Haiti near Les <b>Anglais</b> at this intensity. Matthew was third strongest on record to hit the country, and the strongest to hit Haiti since Hurricane Cleo in 1964, which also struck as a Category4.|$|E
25|$|A live {{performance}} may feature various changes. The performances require {{a minimum of}} 230 players. However, most of the expanded orchestration (double brass, added flutes) {{and some of the}} unique instruments can be removed and replaced by more conventional counterparts (the panpipes can be replaced by a recorder), some roles like the wood flute can be doubled by the existing players. Also, the orchestra (particularly the string section) can be reduced to an overall size of under seventy players in order to accommodate for the additional instruments required while keeping within the limitations of the organiser or the stage. Alternatively, the orchestra can be expanded with a larger string section and added woodwind parts (so the cor <b>anglais,</b> piccolo and contrabassoon are played by separate players to those on the flutes, oboes and bassoons) and the SATBB and boy choirs (an additional, separate male choir is usually not used) are typically expanded, often to as many as 150 and 100 accordingly, or more. The solo roles are often reduced to one or two sopranos, a boy soprano, a girl and a baritone.|$|E
25|$|Slowly {{rounding}} the ridge, Matthew fluctuated in intensity within the Category 4 range from October1–5. Intensification resumed again late on October 3 and culminated when Matthew made landfall near Les <b>Anglais,</b> Haiti, around 11:00 UTC on October 4 with winds of 150mph (240km/h) and a pressure of , {{making it the}} strongest to hit Haiti since Hurricane Cleo in 1964. Continuing northward, the hurricane struck Maisí in Cuba early on October5 as a slightly weaker storm. Cuba's and Haiti's mountainous terrain weakened Matthew to Category 3 status, as it began to accelerate northwestwards through the Bahamas. Restrengthening occurred as Matthew's circulation became better organized, with the storm becoming a Category4 hurricane again while passing Freeport. However, Matthew began to weaken again as an eyewall replacement cycle took place. The storm significantly weakened while closely paralleling the coasts of Florida and Georgia, with the northwestern portion of the outer eyewall coming ashore in Florida while the system was a Category3 hurricane (with the strongest winds remaining just offshore). Matthew weakened to a Category2 hurricane late on October7 {{and then to a}} Category1 hurricane by 12:00UTC on October8.|$|E
25|$|Paris {{was already}} {{famous for its}} {{restaurants}} {{in the first half}} of the 19th century, particularly the Café Riche, the Maison Dorée and the Café <b>Anglais</b> on the Grands Boulevards, where the wealthy personalities of Balzac's novels would dine. The Second Empire had added more luxury restaurants, particularly in the center near the new grand hotels: Durand at the Madeleine; Voisin on the Rue Cambon and Rue Saint-Honoré; Magny on the Rue Mazet; Foyot near the Luxembourg Gardens; and Maire at the corner of the Boulevard de Strasbourg and Boulevard Saint-Denis, where lobster thermidor was invented. During the Belle Époque, many more prestigious restaurants could be found, including Laurent, Fouquet's and the Pavillon de l'Élysée on the Champs-Élysées; the Tour d'Argent on the Quai de la Tournelle; Prunier on the Rue Duphot; Drouant on the Place Gaillon; Lapérouse on the Quai des Grands-Augustins; Lucas Carton at the Madeleine, and Weber on the Rue Royale. The most famous restaurant of the period, Maxim's, also opened its doors on the Rue Royale. Two luxury restaurants were found by the lakes in the Bois de Boulogne: the Pavillon d'Armenonville and the Cascade.|$|E
