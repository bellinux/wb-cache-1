5|$|A new Zelda {{title was}} first hinted at in April 2008, when Miyamoto {{stated that the}} Zelda {{development}} team were reforming to create new games.

The game was officially unveiled at E3 2009, although its official title remained unknown. Due to its in-development state, Miyamoto could not show off gameplay as he had wished. Instead, he showed promotional art featuring Link and Fi. He also announced the game's use of Wii MotionPlus, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> planned 2010 release window. In a later interview, Aonuma's comments on the game's playability brought this release window into doubt.

They used the extra year to both finish the core elements and polish up the game as a whole.|$|E
