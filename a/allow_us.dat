5|$|In the 1960s, Noam Chomsky {{formulated}} the generative {{theory of}} language. According to this theory, {{the most basic}} form of language {{is a set of}} syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called Universal Grammar; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} weeks on board, the Expedition 1 crew members {{activated}} critical {{life support systems}} and computer control, as well as unpacked supplies left behind for them by previous supply missions. At this time the station {{did not have enough}} electricity to heat all three pressurized modules, so Unity was left unused and unheated. Unity had been used {{for the past two years}} to <b>allow</b> <b>U.S.</b> flight controllers to command ISS systems and read station system data.|$|E
5|$|Icke visited Shine four times. During {{the third}} meeting, on 29 March 1990, Icke felt {{something}} like a spider's web on his face, and Shine told him she had a message from Wang Ye Lee of the spirit world. Icke {{had been sent to}} heal the Earth, she said, and would become famous but would face opposition. The spirit world was going to pass ideas to him, which he would speak about to others. He would write five books in three years; in 20 years a new flying machine would <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> to go wherever we wanted and time would have no meaning; and there would be earthquakes in unusual places, because the inner earth was being destabilized by having oil taken from the seabed.|$|E
50|$|Memory <b>allows</b> <b>us</b> {{to store}} {{information}} for later retrieval. Memory is {{often thought of}} as consisting of both a long-term and short-term store. Long-term memory <b>allows</b> <b>us</b> to store information over prolonged periods (days, weeks, years). We {{do not yet know}} the practical limit of long-term memory capacity. Short-term memory <b>allows</b> <b>us</b> to store information over short time scales (seconds or minutes).|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new notion in self-assembly, that of transforming the dynamics of assembly. This notion <b>allows</b> <b>us</b> to have transformation of the plane computed within the assembly process. Then we apply this notion to zooming, which gives us an impossibility result <b>allowing</b> <b>us</b> to pinpoint the notion of locality in the assembly process, and then a construction which <b>allows</b> <b>us</b> to make assembly somewhat scale-independent. 1 Introduction an...|$|R

25|$|As {{the range}} of {{permissible}} transformations becomes broader, {{the range of}} objects one is able to distinguish as preserved by {{the application of the}} transformations becomes narrower. Similarity transformations are fairly narrow (they preserve the relative distance between points) and thus <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> to distinguish relatively many things (e.g., equilateral triangles from non-equilateral triangles). Continuous transformations (which can intuitively be thought of as transformations which allow non-uniform stretching, compression, bending, and twisting, but no ripping or glueing) <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> to distinguish a polygon from an annulus (ring with a hole in the centre), but do not <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> to distinguish two polygons from each other.|$|E

Section 2.1 <b>allows</b> <b>us</b> to address some of the concerns with the estimation results from the Census since we can control for cognitive ability. Section 3 discusses alternative channels that could generate the earnings gap observed in the data. Section 4 concludes.|$|R

25|$|Another {{possibility}} is that Olybrius and Placidia were engaged in 455, and only after Gaiseric freed her from his possession in the early 460s were they at last married. Oost mentions this possibility in his book Galla Placidia Augusta. The surviving evidence {{is not sufficient to}} <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> to decide between these alternatives.|$|E
25|$|Other 'deterministic' {{theories}} actually seek only {{to highlight}} {{the importance of a}} particular factor in predicting the future. These theories often use the factor as a sort of guide or constraint on the future. They need not suppose that complete knowledge of that one factor would <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> to make perfect predictions.|$|E

Bin Laden offered the services of his mujahideen to King Fahd to protect Saudi Arabia from the Iraqi army.
