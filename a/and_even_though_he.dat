5|$|Stanford's {{offense was}} {{commanded}} by redshirt sophomore quarterback Andrew Luck, who completed 70 {{percent of his}} pass attempts, gaining 3,051yards, 28touchdowns, and 7interceptions. The touchdown mark was a Stanford single-season record. He also gained 438yards running the ball, setting a Stanford record for rushing by a quarterback, and his combined rushing and passing total set a record at Stanford for total offense. On December 13, Luck {{finished second in the}} voting for the Heisman Trophy, the annual award given to the best player in college football that season. NCAA rules allow a player three years removed from high school to enter the NFL Draft, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> was only a sophomore in 2010, he met the three-year standard {{at the conclusion of the}} season. Before the Orange Bowl, media and fans speculated as to Luck's likely choice.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey was consecrated on 18 August 1191, at Tours in France, by Bartholomew, the Archbishop of Tours, {{after the}} papacy {{agreed to allow}} the consecration. This {{permission}} was secured by {{the intervention of the}} king and his mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Turner and Heiser see the presumed motivation behind Eleanor and Richard's support {{as part of an effort}} to secure a counter-weight to the power exercised in England by the Chancellor, William Longchamp, about whom complaints had reached Richard in Sicily. Geoffrey received his pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, at his consecration. In September 1191, after the consecration, he attempted to go to York, but was met at Dover by agents of Longchamp, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> took refuge in the priory of St. Martin in Dover, was dragged from sanctuary and imprisoned in Dover Castle. Longchamp claimed that Geoffrey had not sworn fealty to Richard, but this was probably just an excuse to eliminate a rival. Another complication was that the English bishops had appealed to the papacy because Geoffrey had not been consecrated by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Longchamp could therefore claim to have been acting on behalf of the other bishops in ordering Geoffrey's arrest. But the actions of Longchamp's agents were considered excessive and there was soon an outcry against the Chancellor's arrest of Geoffrey, even though Longchamp claimed that his orders had been exceeded by his agents. One cause of the outrage was the obvious parallel with the murder of Thomas Becket, who had been dragged from an altar and martyred. The archbishop was released and took part in a council held at Loddon Bridge, between Reading and Windsor; Longchamp was excommunicated and deposed from the chancellorship, and Hugh of Lincoln, the Bishop of Lincoln, excommunicated those who had dragged Geoffrey from sanctuary. Geoffrey was then enthroned at York on 1 November 1191.|$|E

25|$|Since Neolithic {{times in}} China, {{agriculture}} {{was a key}} element {{to the rise of}} China's civilization and every other civilization. The food that farmers produced sustained the whole of society, while the land tax exacted on farmers' lots and landholders' property produced much of the state revenue for China's pre-modern ruling dynasties. Therefore, the farmer was a valuable member of society, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> was not considered one with the shi class, the families of the shi were still landholders that often produced crops and foodstuffs.|$|E

25|$|During Lightfoot's time at Hiwassee, {{his grades}} {{remained}} fairly poor. He {{played for the}} basketball team while enrolled, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> did not receive stellar marks in the classroom, they were good enough where he could play for a four-year school. After one year at the junior college, Lightfoot left. Due to NCAA rules, by leaving the two-year school early, {{he was forced to}} sit out on what would have been his true sophomore season but still afforded him the ability to retain three years of eligibility. During this one year off, he was determining which school to attend. Larry Eustachy, then-head coach of the Idaho Vandals men's basketball team, had approached Lightfoot during his freshman season at Hiwassee. One of Lightfoot's coaches at Hiwassee became an assistant to Eustachy at Idaho, and after encouragement from several of his junior college teammates who had visited that school and had loved it there, and thus he decided to play at Idaho.|$|E
25|$|Picked for the 1947 South African tour of England, {{he began}} promisingly, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> {{strained}} a muscle {{in the first}} Test and was less effective afterwards, he was picked for all five Tests and finished with 15 wickets, the joint highest number for the side. In the first innings of the first match at Trent Bridge, he took five England wickets for 68 runs {{and it was a}} dropped catch off his bowling in the second innings that, according to the report in the 1948 Wisden, allowed England to escape from the match with a draw after following on 325 runs behind. At Lord's in the second Test, he again took five wickets in the first innings, this time for 115 runs as England amassed 554 runs with centuries by Bill Edrich and Denis Compton.

500|$|The Joker's {{controlling}} and abusive relationship with Harley Quinn has been analysed {{as a means}} of the Joker reinforcing his own belief in his power in a world where he may be killed or neutralized by another villain or Batman. Joker mirrors his identity through Harley in her appearance, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> may ignore or act indifferent towards her, he continues to try and subject her to his control. When Harley successfully defeats Batman in [...] (1994), the Joker, emasculated by his own failure, severely injures her out of fear of what the other villains will think of him. However, while Harley recovers, the Joker sends her flowers which she accepts, reasserting his control over her.|$|E

500|$|In August 2014, it was {{confirmed}} that producers had planned a romance storyline for Mark and his housemate Paige Smith (Olympia Valance). After growing closer, they realised {{that they had}} a deeper connection than friendship. They later agreed to go out for dinner, but neither of them called it a date. Mark struggled with the idea of moving on from Kate, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> knew it was a date, he had not admitted it out loud. Mark ignored Paige afterwards, causing her to confront him as a storm hit Erinsborough. Brennan and Paige then consummated their relationship. Their first official date ended abruptly when Paige turned up wearing an old dress of Kate's she found in a charity shop. Brennan reacted angrily and shouted at Paige to leave the bar. He later realised that he had been too harsh, but just as he decided to give their relationship another go, he saw her kissing another man.

500|$|According to Douglas Jardine's biographer, Christopher Douglas, [...] " [...] hardly put a foot wrong {{during the}} tour <b>and,</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> gave Australia their biggest hiding to date, {{he was and}} {{probably}} remains... {{one of the most}} popular English captains to tour Australia." [...] From the opening games, England followed a strategy of accumulating large totals. For the first Test, to strengthen the team's batting, Chapman and the tour selection committee chose only three specialist bowlers; as the Tests were [...] "timeless"—played to a finish with no time limit—he believed batting to be the key to victory. England batted first and scored 521; Chapman scored 50, but critics believed he should have batted more cautiously. When Australia began their innings, he held a catch from Bill Woodfull in the gully which several observers rated as among the best they had seen. Sydney Southerton, writing of the English fielding, said: [...] "The high note was struck by Chapman himself at Brisbane when, with a catch that will be historic, he dismissed Woodfull... It is my opinion that catch had a pronounced effect on the course of events in the three subsequent Tests ... exercised a most restraining influence on the Australian batsmen." [...] Australia were bowled out for 122; Chapman did not ask Australia to follow-on but batted again, to the crowd's displeasure, and his batsmen relentlessly built up the England lead. When Chapman became the first captain to declare an innings closed in a timeless Test match, Australia needed 742 to win. On a rain-affected pitch, Australia were bowled out for 66; England's win by 675 runs remains in 2016 the largest margin of victory by runs in Tests.|$|E
