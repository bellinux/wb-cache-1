5|$|One final attempt, {{organised}} by Babić, {{was made}} to revive the Z-4 Plan on 16 August. This initiative called for negotiating each point of the plan and extending the autonomous areas to eastern Slavonia. However, Ahrens and Stoltenberg considered any talks between Croatia and the exiled, discredited leaders of the RSK impossible. When they consulted Šarinić about the initiative, he dismissed <b>any</b> <b>possibility</b> of negotiation.|$|E
5|$|The {{early stages}} of Alzheimer's disease are {{difficult}} to diagnose. A definitive diagnosis is usually made once cognitive impairment compromises daily living activities, although the person may still be living independently. The symptoms will progress from mild cognitive problems, such as memory loss through increasing stages of cognitive and non-cognitive disturbances, eliminating <b>any</b> <b>possibility</b> of independent living, especially in the late stages of the disease.|$|E

5|$|The {{report was}} duly reconsidered, but in 1978, the Army Corps of Engineers {{confirmed}} the project {{no longer was}} justified. The audited report was accepted by the U.S. Senate, and no further funding was allocated to study the issue. The final nail in the coffin came on December 1, 1978, when President Jimmy Carter authorized {{the creation of the}} Yukon Flats National Wildlife Monument, which became the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge in 1980. The refuge status eliminated <b>any</b> <b>possibility</b> of flooding the Yukon Flats, a process that would have been inevitable with the construction of the dam.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{subsequent}} claims by Tesla biographers that Edison and Tesla were the original recipients and that neither {{was given the}} award because of their animosity toward each other; that each sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award; that both refused ever to accept the award if the other received it first; that both rejected <b>any</b> <b>possibility</b> of sharing it; and even that a wealthy Edison refused it to keep Tesla from getting the $20,000 prize money.|$|E
5|$|An {{atmospheric}} probe {{was released from}} the spacecraft in July 1995, entering the planet's atmosphere on December 7, 1995. After a high-g descent into the Jovian atmosphere, the probe discarded the remains of its heat shield, and it parachuted through 150km of the atmosphere, collecting data for 57.6minutes, before being crushed by the pressure and temperature to which it was subjected (about 22 times Earth normal, at a temperature of 153°C). It would have melted thereafter, and possibly vaporized. The Galileo orbiter itself experienced a more rapid version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on September 21, 2003 at a speed of over 50km/s, in order to avoid <b>any</b> <b>possibility</b> of it crashing into and contaminating Europa.|$|E

5|$|The {{triumph in}} Caseros was a pivotal {{military}} victory for Brazil. The independence of Paraguay and Uruguay was secured, and the planned Argentine invasion of Rio Grande do Sul was blocked. In {{a period of}} three years, the Empire of Brazil had destroyed <b>any</b> <b>possibility</b> of reconstituting a state encompassing the territories of old Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata, a goal cherished by many in Argentina since independence. Brazil's army and fleet had accomplished what Great Britain and France, the great powers of that time, had not achieved through interventions by their powerful navies. This represented a watershed for the history of the region as it not only ushered in Imperial hegemony over the Platine region, but, according to Brazilian historian J. F. Maya Pedrosa, also in the rest of South America. The War of the Triple Alliance eighteen years later would only be a confirmation of Brazilian dominance.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1s mission {{included}} a flyby of Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which {{had long been}} known to have an atmosphere. Images taken by Pioneer 11 in 1979 had indicated the atmosphere was substantial and complex, further increasing interest. The Titan flyby occurred as the spacecraft entered the system to avoid <b>any</b> <b>possibility</b> of damage closer to Saturn compromising observations, and approached to within , passing behind Titan as seen from Earth and the Sun. Voyager's measurement of the atmosphere's effect on sunlight, and Earth-based measurement of {{its effect on the}} probe's radio signal were used to determine the atmosphere's composition, density, and pressure. Titan's mass was also measured by observing its effect on the probe's trajectory. Thick haze prevented any visual observation of the surface, but the measurement of the atmosphere's composition, temperature, and pressure led to speculation that lakes of liquid hydrocarbons could exist on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland, also {{supported}} Richard's seizure of {{the throne of}} England. The Percys were loyal Lancastrians, but Edward IV eventually won the earl's allegiance. Northumberland had been captured and imprisoned by the Yorkists in 1461, losing his titles and estates; however, Edward released him eight years later and restored his earldom. From that time Northumberland served the Yorkist crown, helping to defend northern England and maintain its peace. Initially the earl had issues with Richard III as Edward groomed his brother to be the leading power of the north. Northumberland was mollified when he was promised {{he would be the}} Warden of the East March, a position that was formerly hereditary for the Percys. He served under Richard during the 1482 invasion of Scotland, and the allure of being in a position to dominate the north of England if Richard went south to assume the crown was his likely motivation for supporting Richard's bid for kingship. However, after becoming king, Richard began moulding his nephew, John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln, to manage the north, passing over Northumberland for the position. According to Carpenter, although the earl was amply compensated, he despaired of <b>any</b> <b>possibility</b> of advancement under Richard.|$|E
50|$|From 1979 till 1985, {{after the}} closure of Tehran-e Mosavar and of the trade union of Iranian journalists Massoud Behnoud didn't have <b>any</b> <b>possibilities</b> to {{continue}} his work. From 1981-1985 he led a low profile existence (more or less in hiding) in Tehran. In 1985 {{he was one of}} the founders of Adineh. For more than 13 years Massoud Behnoud was one of the members of the editorial board.|$|R
50|$|Despite the reforms, the Qizilbash {{would remain}} {{the strongest and}} most {{effective}} element within the military, accounting {{for more than half}} of its total strength. But the creation of this large standing army, that, for the first time in Safavid history, was serving directly under the Shah, significantly reduced their influence, and perhaps <b>any</b> <b>possibilities</b> for the type of civil unrest that had caused havoc during the reign of the previous shahs.|$|R

However, because of {{mistakes}} committed by Gen. Rómmel, the army was located too close to the German border and joined fighting {{from the very beginning of}} the campaign, which deprived it of <b>any</b> <b>possibilities</b> of cooperation with the surrounding units. It consisted of 4 infantry divisions and 2 cavalry brigades.|$|R
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 580 or 581, Mundhir went to Circesium on the river Euphrates, where he joined the Byzantine forces under the new magister militum per Orientem, Maurice, for a {{campaign}} deep into Persian territory. The combined force moved south along the river, accompanied by a fleet of ships. The allied army stormed the fortress of Anatha and moved on until it reached the region of Beth Aramaye in central Mesopotamia, near the Persian capital of Ctesiphon, but there they found the bridge over the Euphrates destroyed by the Persians. With <b>any</b> <b>possibility</b> of a march to Ctesiphon gone, {{they were forced to}} retreat, especially since {{at the same time the}} Persian commander Adarmahan had taken advantage of the Byzantine army's absence and was raiding freely in Osroene, where he sacked the provincial capital Edessa. The retreat was arduous for the exhausted army, and Maurice and Mundhir exchanged recriminations for the expedition's failure. Mundhir and Maurice cooperated however in forcing Adarmahan to withdraw, and defeated him at Callinicum. Upon returning to his lands, Mundhir learned that a combined Persian-Lakhmid force was preparing another attack against the Ghassanid realm. Immediately he set out to meet them, engaged their army and comprehensively defeated it, before going on to capture the enemy camp. It was to be his last victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} rejected most of {{the negative}} criticism. The DfES said that the database would only contain basic information and 'will certainly not be including any information on children's diet or school attainment'. Laming had said that information for every child needs to be kept {{so that they would}} not be at risk. The government denied <b>any</b> <b>possibility</b> of function creep. They rebutted the concerns over privacy, with a spokesman for the DfES saying 'we are conscious of the need to respect personal privacy'. Hodge said that the database would be secure, that it would not undermine child protection and that it would help various agencies share information. Hughes said that the database would be secure and that 'we are confident we are doing all we could to ensure security'. The government said that they were confident that the database complied with the Data Protection Act and the Human Rights Act. Paul Ennals, chief executive of the National Children's Bureau, said, 'the index is a proportionate response to a continuing problem and any action that helps reduce the number of children who slip through the net must be welcome'.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the first}} Prayer Book, the origins and {{participants}} {{in the work of}} its revision are obscure, but it was clear that Cranmer led the project and steered its development. It had begun as early as the end of 1549 when the Convocation of Canterbury met to discuss the matter. Late in 1550, the opinions of Martyr and Bucer were sought on how the liturgy might be improved and they significantly influenced the revision. The spiritual presence view was clarified by the use of entirely different words when the communicants are offered the bread and the wine. New rubrics noted that any kind of bread could be used and any bread or wine that remained could be used by the curate, thus disassociating the elements from any physical presence. The new book removed <b>any</b> <b>possibility</b> of prayers for the dead, as such prayers implied support for the doctrine of purgatory. The Act of Uniformity 1552, which authorised the book's use, specified that it be exclusively used from 1 November. However, the final version was not officially published until nearly the last minute, due to Dudley's intervention. While travelling in the north of the country, he met the Scots reformer, John Knox, then based in Newcastle. Impressed by his preaching, Dudley selected him to be a royal chaplain and brought him south to participate in the reform projects. In a sermon before the king, Knox attacked the practice of kneeling during communion. On 27 September 1552, the Privy Council stopped the printing of the new Prayer Book and told Cranmer to revise it. He responded with a long letter using the argument that it was for Parliament with the royal assent to decide any changes in the liturgy. On 22 October, the council decided to keep the liturgy as it is and add the so-called Black Rubric, which explained that no adoration was intended when kneeling at communion.|$|E
