40|$|Context. <b>Absorption</b> line <b>indices</b> {{are widely}} used to {{determine}} the stellar population parameters such as age and metallicity of galaxies, but {{it is not easy to}} obtain the line indices of some distant galaxies that have colours available. Aims. This paper investigates the correlations between <b>absorption</b> line <b>indices</b> and colours. Methods. A few statistical fitting methods are mainly used, via both the observational data of Sloan Digital Sky Survey and a widely used theoretical stellar population model. Results. Some correlations between widely used <b>absorption</b> line <b>indices</b> and ugriz colours are found from both observational data of early-type galaxies and a theoretical simple stellar population model. In particular, good correlations between colours and widely used <b>absorption</b> line <b>indices</b> such as Dn(4000), HgammaA, HgammaF, HdeltaA, Mg 1, Mg 2, and Mgb, are shown in this paper. Conclusions. Some important <b>absorption</b> line <b>indices</b> of early-type galaxies can be estimated from their colours using correlations between <b>absorption</b> line <b>indices</b> and colours. For example, age-sensitive <b>absorption</b> line <b>indices</b> can be estimated from (u-r) or (g-r) colours and metallicity-sensitive ones from (u - z) or (g - z). This is useful for studying the stellar populations of distant galaxies, especially for statistical investigations. Comment: 9 pages, 21 figures, will be shown in A&...|$|R
