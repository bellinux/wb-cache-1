5|$|The fifth known {{storm of}} the year was yet another cyclone first {{identified}} in post-season reanalysis.

5|$|For {{the first}} few centuries in particular, little is known of the popes and their tombs, and <b>available</b> <b>information</b> is often contradictory. As with other {{religious}} relics, multiple sites claim to house the same tomb. Furthermore, many papal tombs that recycled sarcophagi and other materials from earlier tombs were later recycled for their valuable materials or combined with other monuments. For example, the tomb of Pope Leo I was combined with Leos II, III, and IV circa 855, and then removed {{in the seventeenth century}} and placed under his own altar, below Alessandro Algardi's relief, Fuga d'Attila. The style of papal tombs has evolved considerably throughout history, tracking trends in the development of church monuments. Notable papal tombs have been commissioned from sculptors such as Michelangelo and Gian Lorenzo Bernini.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} after Flight 370's disappearance, discussions {{concerning}} the analysis of satellite data began on the website of space scientist Duncan Steel. The informal group of people, most with scientific backgrounds, soon {{became known as the}} Independent Group (IG) and has worked to analyse possible flight paths to determine the most likely final location of Flight 370. For the first few months, their efforts were hindered by a lack of data publicly released and they were critical of the official analysis by Inmarsat; the IG also pressured officials to release data related to Flight 370's satellite communications. The IG did not believe there was sufficient evidence, using publicly <b>available</b> <b>information,</b> to exclude the possibility of Flight 370 following a northern track prior to the release of the communication logs on 27 May. Some of the IG members have worked on analysing specific elements of Flight 370's flight path, such as the mid-flight speed of Flight 370 and precise location of the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite.|$|E

5|$|The {{analysis}} of communications between Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and Inmarsat's satellite telecommunication network provide {{the only source}} of information about Flight 370's location and possible in-flight events after it disappeared from radar coverage at 2:22Malaysia Standard Time (MYT) on 8March 2014 (17:22UTC, 7March), one hour after communication with air traffic control ended and the aircraft departed from its planned flight path while over the South China Sea. Flight370 was a scheduled commercial flight with 227 passengers and 12 crew which departed Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia at 0:41 and was scheduled to land in Beijing, China at 6:30China Standard Time (6:30MYT; 22:30UTC, 7 March). Malaysia has worked in conjunction with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau to co-ordinate the analysis, which has also involved the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, Inmarsat, and US National Transportation Safety Board, among others. Others have also made efforts to analyse the satellite communications, albeit challenged by a lack of publicly <b>available</b> <b>information</b> for several months after the disappearance. On 29July 2015, debris was discovered on Réunion Island which was later confirmed to come from Flight 370; it is the first physical evidence that Flight370 ended in the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} {{to pass by}} Io were the twin Pioneer 10 and 11 probes on 3 December 1973 and 2 December 1974, respectively.

The camera on board Pioneer11 took the only good image of Io obtained by either spacecraft, showing its north polar region. Close-up images were planned during Pioneer 10s encounter with Io, but those observations were lost because of the high-radiation environment.|$|E
