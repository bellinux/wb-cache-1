5|$|Every Christmas, Oxford Street is {{decorated}} with festive lights. The tradition of Christmas lights began in 1959, {{five years after the}} neighbouring Regent Street. There were no light displays in 1976 or 1977 due to economic recession, but the lights returned in 1978 when Oxford Street organised <b>a</b> <b>laser</b> display, and they have been there every year since.|$|E
5|$|Interferometry {{is another}} method {{to find the}} {{wavelength}} of electromagnetic radiation for determining the speed of light. A coherent beam of light (e.g. from <b>a</b> <b>laser),</b> with a known frequency (f), is split to follow two paths and then recombined. By adjusting the path length while observing the interference pattern and carefully measuring the change in path length, the wavelength of the light (λ) can be determined. The speed of light is then calculated using the equationc=λf.|$|E

5|$|Later in the game, {{the player}} acquires <b>a</b> <b>laser</b> pistol from a fallen foe. The pistol has three capabilities: a {{standard}} fire mode, {{the ability to}} create force fields to block enemy fire, and a powerful charged shot that can break through force fields and some walls.

5|$|Many {{different}} {{energy sources}} {{can be used}} for welding, including a gas flame, an electric arc, <b>a</b> <b>laser,</b> an electron beam, friction, and ultrasound. While often an industrial process, welding may be performed in many different environments, including in open air, under water, and in outer space. Welding is a hazardous undertaking and precautions are required to avoid burns, electric shock, vision damage, inhalation of poisonous gases and fumes, and exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation.|$|E

40|$|The excited-and {{ground-state}} wavepacket behavior {{caused by}} frequency-chirping of <b>a</b> femtosecond <b>laser</b> pulse in H- 2 (-) photodissociation {{has been investigated}} using a time-dependent method. <b>A</b> positive-chirping <b>laser</b> pulse is found to enhance the population transfer between two energy surfaces and also decrease the ground-state wavepacket deformation under <b>a</b> strong <b>laser</b> field. In contrast, <b>a</b> negative-chirping <b>laser</b> pulse will induce a larger ground-state wavepacket deformation. In addition, the excited-state wavepacket created by a positive-chirping pulse has less spatial dispersion, while <b>a</b> negative-chirping <b>laser</b> pulse will generate a more dispersed excited-state wavepacket. This can help us shape a wavepacket, which is of significance in laser control of molecular dynamics. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Nowadays, using {{oscilloscopes}} {{with time}} resolutions {{of less than}} one nanosecond, {{the speed of light}} can be directly measured by timing the delay of a light pulse from <b>a</b> <b>laser</b> or an LED reflected from a mirror. This method is less precise (with errors of the order of 1%) than other modern techniques, but it is sometimes used as a laboratory experiment in college physics classes.|$|E

5|$|Tropic Moon III {{involved}} {{a completely new}} set of systems, up to date, and infinitely more capable than those previously installed. An entire new aircraft sub-variant, the B-57G, was developed for the purpose with a redefined nose to house the new sensor package.

5|$|At E3 2006, Origins was {{announced}} as in development by Climax Studios, instead of by Konami's Team Silent who had developed previous installments. The first previews {{of the game}} featured {{a departure from the}} third-person view typical of the series to a Resident Evil 4-style camera angle, and an emphasis on action and combat to a greater degree than the previous installments in the series. In the previews, Travis had six weapons, divided equally between melee weapons and firearms. Additional changes included <b>a</b> <b>laser</b> sight for his pistol and an option for the player to barricade areas. At the time, the game was expected to be released in late 2006.|$|E
40|$|As-deposited superconducting {{films of}} Y 1 Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7 -delta with zero {{resistance}} at {{a temperature of}} congruent-to 80 K have been successfully grown using <b>a</b> Nd: YAG <b>laser.</b> <b>A</b> substrate temperature in the range 450 - 550 -degrees-C was found most appropriate.

5|$|At the time, {{a number}} of {{different}} drivers were considered, but the introduction of the laser a few years later provided the first obvious solution with the right combination of features. The desired energies were well beyond {{the state of the art}} in laser design, so LLNL began <b>a</b> <b>laser</b> development program in the mid-1960s to reach these levels. Each increase in energy led to new and unexpected optical phenomena that had to be overcome, but these were largely solved by the mid-1970s. Working in parallel with the laser teams, physicists studying the expected reaction using computer simulations adapted from thermonuclear bomb work developed a program known as LASNEX that suggested Q of 1 could be produced at much lower energy levels, in the kilojoule range, levels that the laser team were now able to deliver.|$|E
5|$|Bond escapes {{and calls}} Blofeld, using a similar {{electronic}} device made by Q to pose as Saxby. He finds out Whyte is kept at his summer house {{outside the city}} and goes there with Felix and the CIA. After a brief battle with Whyte's female bodyguards Bambi and Thumper, they rescue Whyte. Saxby attempts to kill Bond outside the summer house, but is fatally shot during the ensuring gunfight. In the meantime, Blofeld abducts Case. With the help of Whyte, Bond raids the lab and uncovers Blofeld's plot to create <b>a</b> <b>laser</b> satellite using the diamonds, which by now has already been sent into orbit. With the satellite, Blofeld destroys nuclear weapons in China, the Soviet Union and the United States, then proposes an international auction for global nuclear supremacy.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{follows the}} {{diamonds}} to a pick-up by Bert Saxby, Whyte's head of security, and then onto a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where {{he finds that}} a satellite is being built by <b>a</b> <b>laser</b> refraction specialist, Professor Dr. Metz. Suspecting Whyte, Bond tries to confront him, but instead meets Blofeld, who captures the agent and explains {{to him that the}} satellite can blow up nuclear missiles. Blofeld admits that he intends to auction it to the highest bidder. Bond escapes and frees the captive Whyte and they establish that Blofeld is using an offshore oil rig as his base. Bond attacks the rig, stopping Blofeld's operation and dispersing his organisation.|$|E
