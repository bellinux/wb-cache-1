5000|$|The word panda was {{borrowed}} into English from French, but no conclusive {{explanation of}} the origin of the French word panda has been found. The closest candidate is the Nepali word ponya, possibly referring to the adapted wrist bone of the red panda, which is native to Nepal.

50|$|The {{superfamily}} Canoidea (or suborder Caniformia) - Canidae (wolves, {{dogs and}} foxes), Mephitidae (skunks and stink badgers), Mustelidae (weasels, badgers, and otters), Procyonidae (raccoons), Ursidae (bears), <b>Ailuridae</b> (red panda), Otariidae (eared seals), Odobenidae (walrus), and Phocidae (earless seals) (the last three families formerly {{classified in the}} superfamily Pinnipedia) and the extinct family Amphicyonidae (bear-dogs) - are characterized by having nonchambered or partially chambered auditory bullae, nonretractable claws, and a well-developed baculum. Most species are rather plain in coloration, lacking the flashy spotted or rosetted coats like many species of felids and viverrids have. This is because Canoidea tend to range in the temperate and subarctic biomes, although Mustelidae and Procyonidae have a few tropical species. Most are terrestrial, although a few species, like procyonids, are arboreal. All families except the Canidae and a few species of Mustelidae are plantigrade. Diet is varied and most tend to be omnivorous to some degree, and thus the carnassial teeth are less specialized. Canoidea have more premolars and molars in an elongated skull.|$|E
40|$|Extant {{members of}} the order Carnivora split into two basal groups, Caniformia (dog-like carnivorans) and Feliformia (cat-like carnivorans). In this study we address phylogenetic {{relationships}} within Caniformia applying various methodological approaches to analyses of complete mitochondrial genomes. Pinnipeds are currently well represented with respect to mitogenomic data and here we add seven mt genomes to the non-pinniped caniform collection. The analyses identified a basal caniform divergence between Cynoidea and Arctoidea. Arctoidea split into three primary groups, Ursidae (including the giant panda), Pinnipedia, and a branch, Musteloidea, which encompassed <b>Ailuridae</b> (red panda), Mephitidae (skunks), Procyonidae (raccoons) and Mustelidae (mustelids). The analyses favored a basal arctoid split between Ursidae and a branch containing Pinnipedia and Musteloidea. Within the Musteloidea there was a preference for a basal divergence between <b>Ailuridae</b> and remaining families. Among the latter, the analyses identified a sister group relationship between Mephitidae and a branch that contained Procyonidae and Mustelidae. The mitogenomic distance between the wolf and the dog was shown {{to be at the}} same level as that of basal human divergences. The wolf and the dog are commonly considered as separate species in the popular literature. The mitogenomic result is inconsistent with that understanding {{at the same time as}} it provides insight into the time of the domestication of the dog relative to basal human mitogenomic divergences...|$|E
40|$|The “false thumb” of pandas is a carpal bone, the radial sesamoid, {{which has}} been {{enlarged}} and functions as an opposable thumb. If the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and the red panda (Ailurus fulgens) are not closely related, their sharing of this adaptation implies a remarkable convergence. The discovery of previously unknown postcranial remains of a Miocene red panda relative, Simocyon batalleri, from the Spanish site of Batallones- 1 (Madrid), now shows that this animal had a false thumb. The radial sesamoid of S. batalleri shows similarities {{with that of the}} red panda, which supports a sister-group relationship and indicates independent evolution in both pandas. The fossils from Batallones- 1 reveal S. batalleri as a puma-sized, semiarboreal carnivore with a moderately hypercarnivore diet. These data suggest that the false thumbs of S. batalleri and Ailurus fulgens were probably inherited from a primitive member of the red panda family (<b>Ailuridae),</b> which lacked the red panda's specializations for herbivory but shared its arboreal adaptations. Thus, it seems that, whereas the false thumb of the giant panda probably evolved for manipulating bamboo, the false thumbs of the red panda and of S. batalleri more likely evolved as an aid for arboreal locomotion, with the red panda secondarily developing its ability for item manipulation and thus producing {{one of the most dramatic}} cases of convergence among vertebrates...|$|E
40|$|Canine {{distemper}} virus (CDV) {{has recently}} expanded its host range to nonhuman primates. A large CDV outbreak occurred in rhesus monkeys at a breeding farm in Guangxi Province, China, in 2006, {{followed by another}} outbreak in rhesus monkeys at an animal center in Beijing in 2008. In 2008 in Japan, a CDV outbreak also occurred in cynomolgus monkeys imported from China. In that outbreak, 46 monkeys died from severe pneumonia during a quarantine period. A CDV strain (CYN 07 -dV) was isolated in Vero cells expressing dog signaling lymphocyte activationmolecule (SLAM). Phylogenic analysis showed that CYN 07 -dV was {{closely related to the}} recent CDV outbreaks in China, suggesting continuing chains of CDV infection in monkeys. In vitro, CYN 07 -dV uses macaca SLAM andmacaca nectin 4 as receptors as efficiently as dog SLAM and dog nectin 4, respectively. CYN 07 -dV showed high virulence in experimentally infected cynomolgus monkeys and excreted progeny viruses in oral fluid and feces. These data revealed that some of the CDV strains, like CYN 07 -dV, have the potential to cause acute systemic infection in monkeys. Canine distemper virus (CDV) causes acute systemic infectionin dogs and other Canidae, with symptoms of fever, coughing, vomiting, diarrhea, ataxia, and paralysis.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} a concatenated (8492 bp) nuclear-mitochondrial DNA {{data set}} from 44 musteloids (including the first genetic data for Lyncodon patagonicus) with parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods of phylogenetic and biogeographic inference and two Bayesian methods of chronological inference. Here {{we show that}} Musteloidea emerged approximately 32. 4 - 30. 9 million years ago (MYA) in Asia, shortly after the greenhouse-icehouse global climate shift at the Eocene-Oligocene transition. During their Oligocene radiation, which proceeded wholly or mostly in Asia, musteloids diversified into four primary divisions: the Mephitidae lineage separated first, succeeded by <b>Ailuridae</b> and the divergence of the Procyonidae and Mustelidae lineages. Mustelidae arose approximately 16. 1 MYA within the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum, and extensively diversified in the Miocene, mostly in Asia. The early offshoots of this radiation largely evolved into badger and marten ecological niches (Taxidiinae, Melinae, Mellivorinae, Guloninae, and Helictidinae), whereas the later divergences have adapted to other niches including those of weasels, polecats, minks, and otters (Mustelinae, Ictonychinae, and Lutrinae). Notably, and contrary to traditional beliefs, the morphological adaptations of badgers, martens, weasels, polecats, and minks each evolved independently more than once within Mustelidae. Ictonychinae (which is most closely related to Lutrinae) arose approximately 9. 5 - 8. 9 MYA, most likely in Asia, where it diverged into the Old World Ictonychini (Vormela, Poecilictis, Ictonyx, and Poecilogale) and New World Lyncodontini (Lyncodon and Galictis) lineages. Ictonychini presumably entered Africa during the Messinian Salinity Crisis (at the Miocene-Pliocene transition), which interposed the origins of this clade (approximately 6. 5 - 6. 0 MYA) and its African Poecilictis-Ictonyx-Poecilogale subclade (approximately 4. 8 - 4. 5 MYA). Lyncodontini originated approximately 2. 9 - 2. 6 MYA at the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition in South America, slightly after {{the emergence of the}} Panamanian land bridge that provided for the Great American Biotic Interchange. As the genera Martes and Ictonyx (as currently circumscribed) are paraphyletic with respect to the genera Gulo and Poecilogale, respectively, we propose that Pekania and Poecilictis be treated as valid genera and that "Martes" pennanti and "Ictonyx" libyca, respectively, be assigned to these genera...|$|E
40|$|The {{red panda}} (Ailurus fulgens), also called red {{cat-bear}} or lesser panda is a threatened species due to human {{destruction of the}} environment the panda is living in. The red panda is the only species in the family <b>Ailuridae,</b> since they can neither {{be in the same}} family as bears or raccoons, but they do belong in the same superfamily as the raccoon. They are classified as carnivores but their diet mainly consists of bamboo. The red panda lives in the foot of the Himalayas in subtropical and temperate forests. They live on an altitude of around 3000 meters close to water and can often be found in winter green trees. The red panda is a solitary animal outside the breeding season but they can live in family groups and in pairs. They can communicate with different kind of sound signals that could sound like birds singing, whistles and high pitch screams. They also have aggressive sounds like growling, hissing and snorting. The panda also communicates by scent marking. They do not spend much time on social behaviours as play, all grooming or aggressive behaviours. The aim {{of this study was to}} see how the red pandas utilise their enclosure, what kind of social behaviour they perform and also if the two of them are connected. To investigate this an ethological study was conducted on three red pandas at Parken Zoo in Eskilstuna, Sweden. Enclosure utilisation was studied with scan sampling with an interval of 1 minute and social behaviour with behaviour observation where every social behaviour was noted. Both methods were used at the same time during four hours a day for ten days during 14 - 15 April. The pandas in this study spend most of their time in trees and especially one tree, a tree which at the time of the study had no leafs. The second most used tree was a pine tree which hade pine needles and it was a surprise the pandas did not prefer that tree. They did not perform much social behaviours and the behaviour performed most was scent marking. At two occasions the pandas interacted with each other by body contact and made aggressive sound signals toward each other. It is not possible to see any connection between enclosure utilisation and social behaviour. But it is possible to see a tendency that the social behaviour occurs in trees, which is probably due to the pandas spending so much of their time in in the trees...|$|E
