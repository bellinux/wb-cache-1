5|$|David Jenkins, who was {{a student}} and {{assistant}} to Parry at Aberystwyth, described him as impulsive and unable to criticise his own works, too erratic {{to be a good}} conductor and too impatient for all but advanced students, but with a boyish enthusiasm, especially for music. Sir Alexander Mackenzie, who also worked with Parry, also noted his great enthusiasm and described him as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> musical ability.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Zhou Tong {{also has}} an {{additional}} disciple named Wu Song. Wu Song becomes famous for killing a man-eating tiger {{with his bare hands}} and is appointed as a constable in his native Shandong. The county magistrate Sun Guoqin later sends Wu on a mission to Kaifeng with precious tiger bone balm in order to curry favor with influential personages. During his stay in the capital, he makes the acquaintance of Zhou. Zhou finds Wu to be <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> strength, but feels that he lacks refinement in his martial technique and, therefore, offers guidance for Wu's training. Unfortunately, these two men only interact for a brief two months before Wu has to return home, never to see Zhou again.|$|E
5|$|The French {{government}} installed Rainilaiarivony in the Geryville {{neighborhood of}} Algiers, {{one of the}} derelict parts of town. He was assigned a French attendant and guard named Joseph Vassé, who maintained detailed documentation on the personality and activities of Rainilaiarivony throughout his exile in French Algeria. Vassé described {{the former prime minister}} as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> spontaneity, sincere friendliness, and openness of heart, but also prone to mood swings, touchiness, and a tendency to be demanding, especially in regard to his particular tastes in clothing. His intelligence, tact and leadership qualities won him the admiration of many who knew him, including Le Myre des Vilers, who referred to him as both an enemy and a friend. Upon learning of Rainilaiarivony's living situation in Algiers, Le Myre de Vilers privately lobbied the French government for better accommodation. Consequently, Vassé found a new home for the former Prime Minister at the elegant estate called Villa des Fleurs ("Villa of the Flowers") in the upscale Mustapha Supérieur neighborhood, neighboring the residence of the exiled former king of Annam.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{not going}} into the {{supposedly}} detailed portions of Historia Augusta, the historian Herodian, a contemporary of Maximinus, mentions him as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>greater</b> size, noting that: [...] "He was in any case <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> such frightening appearance and colossal size {{that there is no}} obvious comparison to be drawn with any of the best-trained Greek athletes or warrior elite of the barbarians." ...|$|R

25|$|He {{was born}} in the British Virgin Islands, studied at Oriel College, Oxford and served in the British Army. His wife was a {{sister-in-law}} of the Marquess of Exeter. He was described as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> accomplishments and elegant manners. After his father's death, he returned to the British Virgin Islands to assume control of the family's plantation.|$|E
25|$|Wilson was <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> charm. Contemporaries {{described}} him as a “delightful whirlwind” and wrote that “there was something spectacular and theatrical about him”. Politicians enjoyed his levity, e.g referring to Haig as “Sir Haig” – Kiggell {{said he was the}} only general who could talk to the “Frocks” on level terms – as did the French, who called him “General Dooble-Vay”. Some senior British officers genuinely believed that his sympathy for the French amounted almost to treason.|$|E
25|$|Spain had {{invested}} {{itself in the}} religious warfare in France after Henry II's death. In 1589, Henry III, {{the last of the}} Valois lineage, died at the walls of Paris. His successor, Henry IV of France, the first Bourbon king of France, was <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> ability, winning key victories against the Catholic League at Arques (1589) and Ivry (1590). Committed to stopping Henry from becoming King of France, the Spanish divided their army in the Netherlands and invaded France in 1590.|$|E

60|$|James was {{personally}} popular for his gaiety and his adventures while he wandered in disguise.

It is {{an easy thing to}} attack James because he would not trust Henry, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who ruined all that did trust to his seeming favour.|$|R
50|$|A time of {{persecution}} followed. At Parma in 1294 {{four members of}} the sect were burned, and Segarelli was condemned to perpetual imprisonment. Six years later he was made to confess a relapse into heresies which he had abjured, and was burned in Parma on July 18, 1300. <b>A</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>greater</b> gifts now took the lead of the sect. This was Dolcino, the son of a priest in the diocese of Novara, {{and a member of the}} order since 1291, an eloquent, enthusiastic utterer of apocalyptic prophecies.|$|R
25|$|Thomas Eakins was <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> character. He {{was a man}} of iron {{will and}} his will to paint and to carry out his life as he thought it should go. This he did. It cost him heavily but in his works we have the {{precious}} result of his independence, his generous heart and his big mind. Eakins was a deep student of life, and with a great love he studied humanity frankly. He was not afraid of what his study revealed to him.|$|E
25|$|Downing was {{undoubtedly}} <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> political, diplomatic, and financial ability, but his character {{has often been}} maligned by his enemies because of his willingness {{to make the most}} of changing political circumstances, and to brutally betray former comrades in order to win favour from his current masters. Today his reputation is undergoing a revision among scholars of the period as his contributions as a financial reformer and diplomat are again recognised. On the other hand, one of his many less attractive personal qualities – miserliness – is well-documented.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{community}} of monks was fairly insignificant during the Middle Ages, the Paromeos Monastery apparently supplied one monk to the patriarchal throne in 1047, Pope Christodolos of Alexandria, who proved to be <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> holiness. The monastery also supplied two monks {{in the seventeenth century}} to the patriarchal throne, Pope Matthew III of Alexandria and Pope Matthew IV of Alexandria. The monastery also produced a number of outstanding theologians, including Father Naum, and Father Abdel Massih ibn Girgis el Masuudi, both of the nineteenth century.|$|E
50|$|In {{the year}} {{leading to the}} end of his term as {{president}} on December 1, 1982, López Portillo personally chose two candidates as possibilities to replace himself, following the succession ritual established by his party. One, Javier García Paniagua, would have been appointed if <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>greater</b> political skill were needed. The other, ultimately his successor, was Miguel de la Madrid, who was chosen for his financial and administrative skills, which were deemed much more necessary after the devaluation of the peso in February 1982 and the subsequent economic crisis.|$|R

25|$|Spain had {{invested}} {{itself in the}} religious warfare in France after Henry II's death. In 1589, Henry III, {{the last of the}} Valois lineage, died at the walls of Paris.

25|$|De Cosmos {{lost the}} 1882 federal {{election}} and retired to Victoria. Although {{widely regarded as}} a stirring orator, effective debater, and <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> intellectual depth, De Cosmos had always been considered eccentric. Contemporaries paint a portrait of an isolated person (he never married and had few intimate friends. Some claimed he had a daughter from a friend he met) with grandiose manners, prone to public outbursts of tears, and a fierce temper that sometimes degenerated into fist-fights. He had unusual phobias — including a fear of electricity. As he grew older, his eccentricities intensified, he became increasingly incoherent.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> {{energy and}} drive, Newsam's {{tendency}} to be impatient with those who disagreed with him meant {{that he was not}} automatically popular with the Home Secretaries under whom he worked. However, his negotiating ability was superb, and he allowed himself time to enjoy the finer things in life. His eventual successor Philip Allen regarded him as operating in the tradition of preserving the liberty of the subject wherever possible; those who had worked under him also noted his highly prized commitment to keeping the politicians in charge of the department out of trouble at all costs.|$|E

25|$|The Xhosas have {{a strong}} oral {{tradition}} with many stories of ancestral heroes; according to tradition, the leader from whose name the Xhosa people take their name was the first King of the nation. One of Xhosa's descendents named Phalo gave birth to two sons, Gcaleka kaPhalo, the heir, and Rarabe ka Phalo, a son from the Right Hand house. Rarabe was a great warrior and <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> ability who was much loved by his father. Gcaleka was a meek and listless man who did not possess all the qualities befitting of a future king. Matters were also complicated by Gcaleka's initiation as a diviner, which was a forbidden practice {{for members of the}} royal family.|$|E
25|$|Our Lady of Bekaa (also spelled Beqaa), is a Marian shrine {{located in}} the city of Zahlé in the Beqaa Valley. In 1958, Bishop Euthym, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> devotion to Our Lady, decided to build a shrine in honor of the Virgin Mary {{on the top of a}} hill {{overlooking}} Zahle and the Bekaa Valley. A ten-meter-high bronze statue of the Virgin Mary, the work of the Italian artist, Pierroti, rests on a 54-meter high tower, crowning a hill known by the name of Tel Chiha. An elevator takes pilgrims and tourists up to a viewing platform overlooking the red-roofed city and offering panoramic views of the valley. The base of the tower houses a small chapel that seats about 100 people.|$|E
25|$|In 1882, Moore {{sold the}} Gertrude {{and built the}} Pacific Slope, {{but by the end}} of the year, he had fallen on hard times again and sold the Pacific Slope to Andrew Onderdonk and {{declared}} bankruptcy again, losing not only his sternwheelers, but also his home and properties in Victoria. John Irving purchased the Western Slope at auction, and being <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> honor, hired Billie to be her captain, Henry her mate and John her purser, thus helping his rival's family remain solvent. William Moore, now 60, was hardly ready to become an employee of his old rival's 28-year-old son, so he built another sternwheeler, the Teaser, which was eventually seized by creditors (despite Billie's attempt to hide her in Alaska), and sold and renamed the Rainbow.|$|E
