30|$|Based on the Australian Standard AS 3600 {{provisions}} the <b>acceptable</b> <b>value</b> for shrinkage {{required a}} value below 0.075  % {{at the age}} 56  days.

Therefore, this clarified that inclusion of GWG microparticles substitute in SCC improved the shrinkage performance. Mix- 0 which contained no GWG showed shrinkage values larger than those of any of the other mixes. This may be attributed to existing more free water that do not combined in hydration process.|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveUncertainty {{about the}} value of {{antiretroviral}} therapy (ARV) adherence interventions may be a barrier to implementation and evaluation. Our objective is to estimate the minimum effectiveness required for ARV adherence interventions to deliver <b>acceptable</b> <b>value.</b> MethodsWe used a validated HIV computer simulation to estimate the impact of ARV adherence interventions on incremental costs and life expectancy. Across a wide range of intervention costs ($ 1000 – 10, 000, one time or per year), we estimated the smallest effect size compatible with <b>acceptable</b> <b>value</b> (incremental cost-effective ratio ≤$ 100, 000 per life-year). Effect sizes were measured using relative risk (RR) and absolute risk reduction (ARR), and these metrics were applied to nonadherence and nonadherence risk factors. Costs were estimated from a societal perspective ($ 2003) discounted at 3 %. ResultsTo give <b>acceptable</b> <b>value,</b> a one-time $ 1000 intervention must reduce ARV nonadherence by RR ≤ 0. 82 (ARR ≥ 0. 04) for moderately nonadherent patients (20 % of ARV doses missed) and RR ≤ 0. 90 (ARR ≥ 0. 05) for severely nonadherent patients (50 % of ARV doses missed). A one-time $ 5000 intervention has an unacceptable value regardless of effect size for moderately nonadherent patients, and must reduce ARV nonadherence by RR ≤ 0. 31 (ARR ≥ 0. 69) for severely nonadherent patients. Interventions aimed at behavioral risk factors (e. g., unhealthy alcohol use) may confer <b>acceptable</b> <b>value</b> (e. g., if ≤$ 2000 and effect RR ≤ 0. 71 [ARR ≥ 0. 29]). ConclusionsARV adherence interventions with plausible effect sizes may offer favorable value if they cost <$ 5000 one time or per year. ARV adherence interventions with a favorable value should become more integral components of HIV care...|$|R
30|$|Another measure {{quantifying}} {{the strength}} of a calibration and uncertainty analysis is the R-factor, which is the average thickness of the 95 PPU band divided by the standard deviation of the measured data.

5000|$|In Asia, both {{empirical}} and steady-state {{mass balance}} approaches {{have been used}} to estimate critical loads. [...] Empirical critical loads were simply determined as the deposition levels with reported field occurrence of detrimental ecological effects. The steady-state mass balance model calculates the critical load of an ecosystem over the long-term by defining <b>acceptable</b> <b>values</b> for elements leaching out of the ecosystem.|$|E
5000|$|Another simple {{example is}} the finitely {{repeated}} prisoner's dilemma for T periods, where the payoff is averaged over the T periods. The only Nash equilibrium of this game is to choose Defect in each period. Now consider the two strategies tit-for-tat and grim trigger.

30|$|The {{reliability}} of the data was checked by using Chronbanch’s alpha statistics. The value of this statistic is 0.917 which {{is greater than the}} minimum <b>acceptable</b> <b>value</b> of 0.70.

50|$|Features 150 nm {{or below}} in size {{generally}} require phase-shifting {{to enhance the}} image quality to <b>acceptable</b> <b>values.</b> This can be achieved in many ways. The two most common methods are to use an attenuated phase-shifting background film on the mask to increase the contrast of small intensity peaks, or to etch the exposed quartz so that the edge between the etched and unetched areas {{can be used to}} image nearly zero intensity. In the second case, unwanted edges would need to be trimmed out with another exposure. The former method is attenuated phase-shifting, and is often considered a weak enhancement, requiring special illumination for the most enhancement, while the latter method is known as alternating-aperture phase-shifting, and is the most popular strong enhancement technique.|$|E
50|$|To a user, a magic {{pushbutton}} system appears {{clumsy and}} frustrating to use. Business logic is unavailable before the button press, so the user interface {{appears as a}} bland form-filling exercise. There is no opportunity for assistance in filling out fields, or for offering drop-down lists of <b>acceptable</b> <b>values.</b> In particular, {{it is impossible to}} provide assistance with later fields, based on entries already placed in earlier fields. For instance, a choice from a very large list of insurance claim codes might be filtered to a much smaller list, if the user has already selected Home/Car/Pet insurance, or if they have already entered their own identification and so the system can determine the set of risks for which they're actually covered, omitting the obscure policies that are now known to be irrelevant for this transaction.|$|E
5000|$|Boiling water {{reactors}} {{generally have}} negative void coefficients, and in normal operation the negative void coefficient allows reactor {{power to be}} adjusted by changing the rate of water flow through the core. However, the negative void coefficient can cause an unplanned reactor power increase in events (such as sudden closure of a steamline valve) where the reactor pressure is suddenly increased. In addition, the negative void coefficient can result in power oscillations {{in the event of}} a sudden reduction in core flow, such as might be caused by a recirculation pump failure. Boiling water reactors are designed to ensure that the rate of pressure rise from a sudden steamline valve closure is limited to <b>acceptable</b> <b>values,</b> and they include multiple safety systems designed to ensure that any sudden reactor power increases or unstable power oscillations are terminated before fuel or piping damage can occur.|$|E

5000|$|... where R is resistance, A and B are constants, and T is {{absolute}} temperature (K).The constant B {{is related to}} the energies required to form and move the charge carriers responsible for electrical conduction hence, as the value of B increases, the material becomes insulating. Practical and commercial NTC resistors aim to combine modest resistance with a value of B that provides good sensitivity to temperature. Such is the importance of the B constant value, {{that it is possible to}} characterize NTC thermistors using the B parameter equation:where [...] is resistance at temperature [...]Therefore, many materials that produce <b>acceptable</b> <b>values</b> of [...] include materials that have been alloyed or possess variable negative temperature coefficient (NTC), which occurs when a physical property (such as thermal conductivity or electrical resistivity) of a material lowers with increasing temperature, typically in a defined temperature range. For most materials, electrical resistivity will decrease with increasing temperature.|$|E
50|$|Connection-oriented {{transmission}} {{requires a}} setup phase in each involved node before any packet {{is transferred to}} establish the parameters of communication. The packets include a connection identifier rather than address information and are negotiated between endpoints {{so that they are}} delivered in order and with error checking. Address information is only transferred to each node during the connection set-up phase, when the route to the destination is discovered and an entry is added to the switching table in each network node through which the connection passes. The signaling protocols used allow the application to specify its requirements and discover link parameters. <b>Acceptable</b> <b>values</b> for service parameters may be negotiated. Routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection id in a table. The packet header can be small, as it only needs to contain this code and any information, such as length, timestamp, or sequence number, which is different for different packets.|$|E
50|$|For example, a gage with 3% manufacturer-stated {{accuracy}} can {{be changed}} to 4% so that a 1% accuracy standard can be used at 4:1. If the gage is used in an application requiring 16% accuracy, having the gage accuracy reduced to 4% will not affect {{the accuracy of the}} final measurements. This is called a limited calibration. But if the final measurement requires 10% accuracy, then the 3% gage never can be better than 3.3:1. Then perhaps adjusting the calibration tolerance for the gage would be a better solution. If the calibration is performed at 100 units, the 1% standard would actually be anywhere between 99 and 101 units. The <b>acceptable</b> <b>values</b> of calibrations where the test equipment is at the 4:1 ratio would be 96 to 104 units, inclusive. Changing the acceptable range to 97 to 103 units would remove the potential contribution of all of the standards and preserve a 3.3:1 ratio. Continuing, a further change to the acceptable range to 98 to 102 restores more than a 4:1 final ratio.|$|E

30|$|In {{cases where}} the studies are not equally reliable, the range and {{distribution}} of all available DegT 50 values should be examined in the WoE approach.
