Though the SECR believed the roof had a lifespan of at least forty more years, they decided not to repair it but to replace it entirely. A travelling timber gantry had to be constructed to take the remainder of the station roof down safely. The replacement was a utilitarian post and girder structure supporting a ridge and furrow roof. The curve of the original roof design can still be seen on the interior brickwork. The station was partially re-opened on 19 March 1906.|$|E
5|$|On 12 September 1920, Haruna was {{involved}} in gunnery drills off Hokkaidō when a breech explosion destroyed the starboard gun of the No.1 turret, killing seven men and badly damaging the armored roof of the turret. A later investigation by the Imperial Japanese Navy concluded that <b>a</b> <b>faulty</b> fuse ignited the gunpowder bags in the breech, detonating the shell while still in the barrel. The turret was repaired at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, where the elevation of her 14-inch guns was also increased by seven degrees. Three months later, she was once again placed in reserve.|$|E

The three launch games, {{all of which were}} ported from Sega's VIC dual-arcade board, lacked the name {{recognition}} of Famicom launch games Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., and Popeye. However, the situation was quickly turned around. Thanks in part to the SG-1000's steadier stream of releases (21 SG-1000 games by the end of 1983, as compared to only 9 Famicom games), and in part to a recall on Famicom units necessitated by <b>a</b> <b>faulty</b> circuit, the SG-1000 chalked up 160,000 units in sales in 1983, far exceeding Sega's projection of 50,000 units.|$|E

5|$|By January 1904, {{the ship}} had become the {{flagship}} of the Channel Fleet. As {{a result of a}} reorganization in January 1905, the Channel Fleet became the Atlantic Fleet, and Magnificent accordingly became a part of the Atlantic Fleet. A gun explosion aboard Magnificent on 14 June 1905 resulted in 18 casualties. The explosion was caused by <b>a</b> <b>faulty</b> shell in one of the 6-inch guns; it failed to fire, and when the loader opened the breech, contact with the fresh air detonated the shell. On 15 November 1906, she ended her Atlantic Fleet service and was paid off at Devonport. Magnificent was commissioned into reserve on 16 November 1906, based at Chatham. During her reserve service, she was attached to the Gunnery School at Sheerness as a gunnery training ship in December 1906.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of design work, KnAAPO constructed the first prototype, which was finished in mid-2007. The prototype, Su-35-1, was then transferred to the Gromov Flight Research Institute at Zhukovsky Airfield, in preparation for its maiden flight. On 19 February 2008, Sergey Bogdan took the aircraft aloft for its 55-minute first flight from Zhukovsky, accompanied by an Su-30MK2 acting as a chase plane. Bogdan later piloted the second prototype on its maiden flight on 2 October from KnAAPO's Dzyomgi Airport. The flight-test programme was expected to involve three flying prototypes, but on 26 April 2009, a day before its scheduled maiden flight, the fourth Su-35 (there's a static test aircraft) crashed during a taxi run at Dzyomgi Airport. The aircraft struck a barrier {{at the end of}} the runway and was destroyed by fire; the pilot ejected and sustained burn injuries. A commission was opened to investigate the crash, but several sources initially speculated that the incident had been the result of a brake failure or <b>a</b> <b>faulty</b> fuel pump.|$|E
5|$|For the 1980 Grand Prix season, the Yamaha factory {{made the}} Yamaha USA team of Roberts and Carruthers {{the de facto}} factory racing team. The season got {{underway}} two months late due to cancellation of Austrian and Venezuelan rounds. Barry Sheene {{had been replaced by}} Randy Mamola as the top Suzuki rider as, Sheene had been dissatisfied with the Suzuki's efforts and had turned to a privateer Yamaha team. Roberts won the first three races as the Suzuki team appeared to be in disarray, but by the third race, the Suzukis of Mamola and Marco Lucchinelli were making things more difficult for Roberts. Roberts' Yamaha suffered a deflating front tire and <b>a</b> <b>faulty</b> rear shock absorber in the Netherlands forcing him {{to pull out of the}} race, but his main championship rivals also suffered setbacks with Cecotto, Ferrari and Hartog all missing races due to injuries and Sheene suffering mechanical breakdowns. Suzuki riders went on to win the last four races, but Roberts had built up a sufficient point lead to hold on and clinch his third consecutive 500cc world championship.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{deterministic}} fault-tolerant and deadlock-free routing protocol in two-dimensional (2 D) meshes based on dimension-order routing and the odd-even turn model. The proposed protocol, called extended X-Y routing, {{does not use}} any virtual channels by prohibiting certain locations of faults and destinations. Faults are contained {{in a set of}} disjointed rectangular regions called faulty blocks. The number of faults to be tolerated is unbounded as long as nodes outside faulty blocks are connected in the 2 D mesh network. The extended X-Y routing can also be used under a special convex fault region called <b>an</b> orthogonal <b>faulty</b> block, which can be derived from <b>a</b> given <b>faulty</b> block by activating some nonfaulty nodes in the block. Extensions to partially adaptive routing, traffic and adaptivity-balanced using virtual networks, and routing without constraints using virtual channels and virtual networks are also discussed...|$|R

5|$|Olivia {{suggests}} {{the possibility that}} the effect is due to quantum entanglement between Alice in the prime universe and Derek in the parallel one. Alice previously told Olivia that Derek died recently from trying to replace <b>a</b> <b>faulty</b> fuse after they flipped a coin to decide who would replace it, and Walter surmises that the parallel universe Alice died in a similar fashion due to a different outcome of the coin flip. Alice's connection to the parallel universe Derek is causing the crack. As the building starts to exhibit the initial signs of a singularity and Broyles (Lance Reddick) prepares to release the amber, Olivia and Peter attempt to persuade Alice that the man she sees is not really her husband. Alice does not believe them until Derek starts to refer to their children. Alice, who is childless, realizes Peter and Olivia are telling the truth; the connection is broken and the effects on the building ebb away.|$|E
