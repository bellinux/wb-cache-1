5|$|There were {{periodic}} {{waves of}} South Indian influence over Sri Lankan <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>architecture,</b> though the prolific age of monumental <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>architecture</b> {{seemed to have}} declined by the 13th century. Temples built by the Tamils of Indian origin from the 10th century belonged to the Madurai variant of Vijayanagar period. A prominent feature of the Madurai style was the ornate and heavily sculptured tower or gopuram over the entrance of temple. None of the important religious constructions of this style within the territory that formed the Jaffna kingdom survived the destructive hostility of the Portuguese.|$|E
5|$|In the 1st century AD rich burials first {{appeared}} and Tikal underwent {{a political and}} cultural florescence as its giant northern neighbors declined. At {{the end of the}} Late Preclassic, the Izapan style <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>architecture</b> from the Pacific Coast began to influence Tikal, as demonstrated by a broken sculpture from the acropolis and early murals at the city.|$|E

5|$|The Norse {{legacy of}} <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>architecture</b> is limited. The Christchurch at Brough of Birsay, now reduced, was the early {{seat of the}} Bishop's of Orkney. St. Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall is {{peerless}} {{as an example of}} Norse-era construction in Scotland and St. Magnus Church, on Egilsay retains its round tower. The iconic Lewis chessmen are the best known treasure trove and numerous finds of grave goods including brooches and weaponry such as the Scar boat burial are well-documented.|$|E
5|$|The Rashtrakuta {{contributions}} to <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>architecture</b> {{are reflected in}} the splendid rock-cut cave temples at Ellora and Elephanta, areas also occupied by Jain monks, located in present-day Maharashtra. The Ellora site was originally part of a complex of 34 Buddhist caves probably created {{in the first half of}} the 6th century whose structural details show Pandyan influence. Cave temples occupied by Hindus are from later periods.|$|E
5|$|The {{most likely}} cause of {{collapse}} at Tikal is overpopulation and agrarian failure. The fall of Tikal was {{a blow to}} the heart of Classic Maya civilization, the city having {{been at the forefront of}} courtly life, <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>architecture</b> for over a thousand years, with an ancient ruling dynasty. However, new research regarding paleoenvironmental proxies from the Tikal reservoir system suggests that a meteorological drought may have led to the abandonment of Tikal.|$|E

5|$|The sixth Mughal emperor, Aurangzeb, chose Lahore for as {{the site}} for his new {{imperial}} mosque. Aurangzeb, unlike the previous emperors, was not a major patron of <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>architecture</b> and instead focused much of his reign on various military conquests, which added over 3 million square kilometres to the Mughal realm.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{built as}} a prayer hall with five aisles and a modest central courtyard, the mosque has since been {{expanded}} multiple times with additional installations completely surrounding the original structure. Many of Egypt's rulers have shaped the <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>architecture</b> of al-Azhar, from the minarets added by the Mamluks and the gates added during Ottoman rule to more recent renovations such as the installation of a new mihrab. None of the original minarets or domes have survived, {{with some of the}} current minarets having been rebuilt several times.|$|E
5|$|The 15th and 16th centuries {{were known}} as Poland's Złoty Wiek or Golden Age.

During the reign of Casimir IV, various artists came to work and live in Kraków, and Johann Haller established a printing press in the city after Kasper Straube had printed the Calendarium Cracoviense, the first work printed in Poland, in 1473.|$|E

5|$|The Nara period (710–784) of the 8th century marked an {{emergence}} of the centralized Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heijō-kyō (modern Nara). The Nara period {{is characterized by the}} appearance of a nascent literature as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>architecture.</b> The smallpox epidemic of 735–737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population. In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital from Nara to Nagaoka-kyō, then to Heian-kyō (modern Kyoto) in 794.|$|E
5|$|The Renaissance in Scotland {{has been}} seen as {{reaching}} its peak {{in the first half of}} the sixteenth century, between the reigns of James IV and the deposition of Mary Queen of Scots. The loss of the church as a source of patronage in the 1560s and the court in 1603, changed and limited the further development of Renaissance ideas. In the same period civic humanism began to give way to private devotion and retreat from the world influenced by Stoicism. In <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>architecture,</b> Renaissance proportion began to give way to Mannerism and the more exaggerated style of the Baroque from about 1620.|$|E
