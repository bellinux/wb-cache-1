5|$|Greed is {{the first}} main theme that is {{introduced}} into the book, and specifically the desire to obtain gold.

5|$|It was {{initially}} decided to first sign an A-list actor for Superman before Richard Donner {{was hired as}} director. Robert Redford was offered <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>sum,</b> but felt he was too famous. Burt Reynolds also turned down the role, while Sylvester Stallone was interested, but nothing ever came of it. Paul Newman was offered his choice of roles as Superman, Lex Luthor or Jor-El for $4million, turning down all three roles.|$|E

5|$|The {{expedition}} was {{a private}} venture much like the Drake-Norris expedition, supported by limited assistance and subsidies from the crown. Its objective was to pillage Spanish and Portuguese ships within the Atlantic, off the Spanish coast or within the Caribbean {{and to make a}} profit from which the Queen's portion would amount to <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>sum.</b>|$|E
5|$|At one point, {{most of the}} Native Alaskans in {{the film}} went on strike. They were paid $5 per day for being extras, {{participating}} in hunts or tribal ceremonies, or for acting in minor roles. Although this was <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> for Alaska at the time, many decided to strike for $10 or $15 a day. Van Dyke immediately hired strikebreakers from among the other native people as replacements, and the strike ended.|$|E
5|$|Concerned {{about the}} succession, Henry sought to persuade Louis VI {{to accept his}} son, William Adelin, as the {{legitimate}} future Duke of Normandy, {{in exchange for his}} son's homage. Henry crossed into Normandy in 1115 and assembled the Norman barons to swear loyalty; he also almost successfully negotiated a settlement with King Louis, affirming William's right to the Duchy in exchange for <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> of money, but the deal fell through and Louis, backed by his ally Baldwin of Flanders, instead declared that he considered William Clito the legitimate heir to the Duchy.|$|E

5|$|Najm-ul-Hassan {{was also}} Devika's co-star in the studio's next venture, Jeevan Naiya. The two co-stars {{developed}} a romantic relationship, {{and during the}} shooting schedule of Jeevan Naiya, Devika eloped with Hassan. Himanshu was both enraged and distraught. Since the leading pair were absent, production was stalled. A {{significant portion of the}} movie had been shot and <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> of money, which had been taken as credit from financers, had been spent. The studio therefore suffered severe financial losses and a loss of credit among bankers in the city while the runaway couple made merry.|$|E
5|$|St-Calais {{returned}} to Durham on 11 September 1091, with <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> {{of money and}} gifts for his church. Thereafter he remained in the king's favour. In fact, in 1093 his lands were restored without the need to perform feudal services. For {{the rest of his}} life, St-Calais remained a frequent advisor to the king. It was St-Calais, along with Robert, Count of Meulan who negotiated with Anselm, the abbot of Bec, in 1093 over the conditions under which Anselm would allow himself to be elected Archbishop of Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|Abu Bakar's {{relationship}} with the ruler of Muar, Sultan Ali was strained. Soon after Abu Bakar succeeded his father, he {{sent a letter to}} Sultan Ali asserting Johor's sovereignty over Segamat, which Sultan Ali had hoped to exert political influence over. In addition, Sultan Ali, who had borrowed <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> from an Indian moneylender in 1860, became a source of irritation for Abu Bakar. Facing difficulties in repaying his debt, Sultan Ali asked Abu Bakar to pay Ali's monthly pension to the moneylender; but he alternated asking for payment to himself and to the moneylender. In 1866, when the moneylender lodged a complaint with the British government, Sultan Ali tried to borrow from Abu Bakar to repay his outstanding debts. As a result of these constant irritations, Abu Bakar persuaded the Straits Governor to sign an agreement to terminate Sultan Ali's pension at the agreement of Abu Bakar and Governor.|$|E

5|$|Although never gaining wide fame, Ali had a {{dedicated}} following on the vaudeville circuit in the United States. He performed for {{heads of state}} including Tsar NicholasII of Russia. Judy Garland named him her favorite vaudevillian and David Blaine identified Ali as his favorite magician. Portions of his act were captured in the short film Strange as It Seems (1930) and in Politiquerias (1931), the Spanish-language version of Laurel and Hardy's Chickens Come Home. Two documentaries contain footage of Ali taken from Politiquerias: 1977's Gizmo!, and 1999's Vaudeville. Ali's unusual gastric abilities led to rumors that the Rockefeller Institute had offered <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> of money to obtain his stomach post-mortem. After he died in England, his body was offered to Johns Hopkins University for study, though the offer was declined.|$|E
5|$|Chanel {{bought the}} five acre plot on which La Pausa {{was built for}} 1.8 million French francs in February 1929. The plot had {{formerly}} {{been part of the}} hunting grounds of the ruling family of Monaco, the Grimaldis, and contained wild olive and orange groves. The villa was built less than a year later. The final cost of the villa was 6 million francs, <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> for the time. It is not clear whether Chanel or her lover, Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster financed the building and furnishing of La Pausa. La Pausa was built by architect Robert Streitz, who sought to build 'the ideal Mediterranean villa'.|$|E
5|$|Coggins's {{interest}} in sailing and maritime subjects began in London {{when he would}} sail model yachts on Round Pond in Kensington Gardens. This interest developed into a lifelong passion during his teens when he sailed small craft on Hempstead Harbor, near his new home on Long Island. During {{the early years of}} World War II, Coggins took a sampling of his war illustrations to Worthen Paxton, the art director of LIFE Magazine, who commissioned Coggins to produce a drawing of an imaginary coastal invasion of England. Coggins was paid $250 for that work, <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> at the time, which paid his rent for five months. Appearing on July 15, 1940, this was the first of many war time illustrations for LIFE. Some of Coggins's works are in the Anne S. K. Brown Military Collection.|$|E

He was also given monies to cover his travelling expenses from China and <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>sum</b> to cover his expenses on his return.|$|R
50|$|In 1085 the Domesday Book {{recorded}} forty-nine men. The {{book also}} mentions a church, standing in eight acres, and valued at sixteen pence (<b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>sum</b> than it now sounds).

5|$|Cortex sends his loyal Lab Assistants to {{find the}} pieces of the map {{scattered}} throughout the big City and bring them to him. Now that the contestants know about the map, the Viscount decides to reveal his true intentions: the Super Big Power Crystal can grant a single wish who whoever obtains it, and the Viscount is willing to give <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> of money to those who help him find it. Finding the Power Crystal is impossible without the Final Key, so the Viscount boards his plane to travel to the North Atlantic Ocean in search for the Final Key. But the plane is full, and only a select number of the contestants are able to board. Propelled to the skies by an explosive volcano, the contestants are able to board the Viscount's plane.|$|E
5|$|Higginbotham's {{desire to}} play regular first-team {{football}} led to him joining Derby County for a £2million fee – <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> {{for a young}} player with just four top-flight appearances to his name. His decision to leave Manchester United was praised by the player he failed to displace, Denis Irwin. Higginbotham made his debut in a 2–2 draw with Southampton, and had a good start to his Derby career until he was substituted at half-time during his third appearance after struggling to contain Everton's Niclas Alexandersson. Manager Jim Smith soon switched to a new system without any full-backs but Higginbotham adapted well to playing on the left-side of a three-man defence. Derby avoid relegation out of the Premier League on the penultimate day of 2000–01 with a 1–0 victory over former his club Manchester United at Old Trafford.|$|E
5|$|His {{behaviour}} {{on campaign}} {{can only be}} described as perfectly honourable and at times humane, a trait which was illustrated during the French Revolutionary Wars, when he spared no effort to protect captured émigrés from the wrath of the Revolutionary radicals in the army. He also showed respect for occupied populations and never tolerated pillaging nor violence from his men. As a sign a gratitude, he was offered gifts several times but he was often seen refusing and sending them back. While on campaign in Tyrol, he was recorded to have accepted <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> of money but he immediately distributed it to the local hospitals. Further evidence of his humanity was the care that he displayed for the lives and well-being of his men, whom he was always reluctant to sacrifice for the sake of glory.|$|E
