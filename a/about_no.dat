5|$|Frederick grew {{up during}} a tumultuous {{political}} period as {{the concept of}} liberalism in Germany, which evolved during the 1840s, was gaining widespread and enthusiastic support. The liberals sought a unified Germany and were constitutional monarchists who desired a constitution to ensure equal protection under the law, the protection of property, and the safeguarding of basic civil rights. Overall, the liberals desired a government ruled by popular representation. When Frederick was 17, these emergent nationalistic and liberal sentiments sparked a series of political uprisings across the German states and elsewhere in Europe. In Germany, their goal was to protect freedoms, such as the freedom of assembly and freedom of the press, {{and to create a}} German parliament and constitution. Although the uprisings ultimately brought <b>about</b> <b>no</b> lasting changes, liberal sentiments remained an influential force in German politics throughout Frederick's life.|$|E
5|$|India had {{not lost}} a home test series since 1987 (against Pakistan) and when South Africa toured India in February – March 2000, that streak was ended as India lost the home series 2–0. However events outside the field overshadowed the cricket: Before {{start of the}} series, Tendulkar {{announced}} his decision to relinquish the captaincy after the Test matches, Azharuddin and Mongia were recalled to the team, controversy arose over Azharuddin's injury leading to his exclusion from the First Test. Ganguly was made {{the captain of the}} Indian team for the one-day series. Talks in the media <b>about</b> <b>no</b> way but 'UP' were not unfounded when India took a 2–0 lead in the ODI Series and finishing the series at 3–2, after South Africa won the last two matches. It was learnt later that South Africa's captain Cronje was involved in betting and there were attempts to buy-off South African players by Cronje and bookmakers. At the end of the series, the media felt that Ganguly's attitude and captaincy was heartening. In March 2000, India participated in a triangular series with South Africa and Pakistan. India won only one of their four matches and missed the finals.|$|E

25|$|As Titor gained {{significant}} attention, {{there also}} emerged analysis and discussion concerning {{the veracity of}} his claims about his origins and mission, and the future events he talked <b>about.</b> <b>No</b> John Titor or Titor family is known to exist, meaning that who posted as Titor used a pseudonym. The story has been called inconsistent as contradictions between statements at different times have been observed. Holding the many-worlds interpretation as correct, Titor claimed that his mission as a time traveler was to shape a timeline in which many chaotic events of his time, including World War III and {{the civil war in}} the US, never happened. In some supposed Titor's appearances in the internet and other media segments prior to his main posts (notably in faxes to the radio talk show Coast to Coast AM in 1998), he stated that {{he was not able to}} change the future despite his efforts, suggesting one of the possible contradictions. Nevertheless, none of the specific events he predicted to a near future, chaotic or not, have come to happen (see below).|$|E

25|$|The {{scene is}} laid {{in a vast}} forest sacred to Diana, where Adonis (soprano en travesti), as a {{follower}} of the chaste goddess, abhors love as a terrible monster jeopardizing humans’ peace of mind, {{but at the same}} time complains <b>about</b> <b>no</b> longer feeling the lure of sylvan life. Cupid himself (soprano en travesti) descends into the forest and approaches Adonis in order to tear him from Diana and to hand him over to Venus, who is in love with him. When Venus (soprano) arrives upon the scene, she easily succeeds in getting the better of Adonis’ scruples and, supported by Cupid, they resolve to flee in order to shun Diana’s dreadful wrath. When Diana (soprano) enters the scene, she charges Cupid with the abduction of credulous Adonis and entreats vengeance of heaven and hell. Mercury (haute-contre) then descends onto the scene assuring the enraged goddess that Venus will return Adonis to her, and the goddess of love re-enters over a cloud accompanied by Cupid and Adonis disguised as Cupid, so that Diana cannot tell them apart. Since Adonis refuses to reveal himself, Diana decides to withdraw for fear of possibly choosing Cupid, her bitterest enemy. The entrée goes on firstly to a ballet celebrating the coming wedding of Venus and Adonis, as in the distance Diana herself (ballerina) is shown to be falling in love with a sleeping Endymion (male dancer), and then to further more elaborate ballets representing Diana and Cupid’s(ballerina en travesti) meeting, Cupid's wakening Endymion and eventually Endymon's making love to Diana and his admission onto her cart. The entrée ends in a festive chorus accompanied by a general dance.|$|E

Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu awarded the games a composite score of 37 out of 40 based on four individual reviews, of which the ratings were 9, 10, 9, and 9. The reviewers praised the games for retaining much of the quality that drew them to the original Gold and Silver. The only drawback mentioned was that the games brought [...] "no major surprises". Nintendo Power gave the games {{one of the highest}} scores, remarking on its replay value though criticizing shortly <b>about</b> <b>no</b> improvement in graphic animation for Pokémon sprites.

When they enter the house Homer confronts Hud, accusing his son of trying to corrupt Lonnie. They argue, with Hud accusing Homer of hypocrisy and resentment of him for Norman's death. Homer replies that his disappointment in Hud began before the accident; Hud cares <b>about</b> <b>no</b> one but himself, and is [...] "not fit to live with". Hurt and angry, Hud retorts [...] "My mama loved me, but she died" [...] as he walks away.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 69, based on 15 reviews. Rolling Stones Rob Sheffield wrote it was [...] "impressive to hear No Doubt summon the musical imagination {{to transcend the}} formula that used to imprison them". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic referred to the album as [...] "a good, hooky, stylish mainstream pop record". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly remarked that there was [...] "something oddly flimsy" [...] <b>about</b> <b>No</b> Doubt that prevented it from becoming a milestone in pop music, but that the band's [...] "party-throwing skills improve with each new gathering." [...] Colleen of Delaney of Stylus Magazine commented that the band sounded like it had [...] "growing pains" [...] and was unsure of its place in mainstream rock, predicting that No Doubt would either become a singles band [...] "or go all Radiohead on us and make an album of avant-jazz-electro-acid-funk-polka." ...|$|E
500|$|Rapper Snoop Dogg, {{who had a}} {{significant}} role on the album, was praised for his lyrics and flow, and it was mentioned that [...] "Coupled with his inventive rhymes, Snoop's distinctive style made him a superstar before he'd even released a recording of his own" [...] and that his involvement was {{as important to the}} album's success as its production. Touré of The New York Times remarks that [...] "While Snoop delivers rhymes delicately, the content is anything but. Growing up poor, often surrounded by violence, and having served six months in the Wayside County jail outside of Los Angeles (for cocaine possession) gave Snoop Dogg experiences upon which he draws." [...] Snoop Dogg later commented on the [...] "reality" [...] of his lyrics, stating [...] "My raps are incidents where either I saw it happen to one of my close homies or I know about it from just being in the ghetto. I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping <b>about</b> <b>no</b> bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and that's that street life.

500|$|The {{song was}} written by McCartney when he was staying with new wife Linda in New York in March 1969, shortly after the Get Back {{sessions}} that ultimately resulted in Let It Be. John Lennon and McCartney were at risk of losing overall control of Northern Songs, the company that published their songs, after ATV Music bought a majority share. McCartney had been {{largely responsible for the}} group's direction and projects since the death of manager Brian Epstein in 1967, but began to realise that the group dynamic of the Beatles was coming to an end. He was particularly unhappy at the others wanting to draft in manager Allen Klein to help sort out their finances. McCartney later said that the song was written with Klein in mind, saying [...] "it's basically a song <b>about</b> <b>no</b> faith in the person". He added that the line [...] "One sweet dream, pack up the bags, get in the limousine" [...] was based on his trips in the country with Linda {{to get away from the}} tense atmosphere with the Beatles, though author Walter Everett thought the line was also a nostalgic look at the Beatles' touring years, which had ended in 1966.|$|E

500|$|The {{subjects}} {{focused on}} in the album's lyrics include Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood and drug addiction. He stated that [...] "I wrote 'Fuck Me' 'cause I know how I've been perceived. [...] "I can {{look back at the}} whole Vanilla Ice thing, and it was played way out. It was just an image thing. I was always real to the music. But it built a huge hurdle for me to get over musically. A lot of people didn't even want to admit they bought a Vanilla Ice record." [...] "Too Cold" [...] is a rap rock remake of Vanilla Ice's biggest hit, [...] "Ice Ice Baby". Vanilla Ice stated that he remade the song because [...] "I wanted to let people know that I'm not running from anything. This is me. This is what I'm about. I think the music speaks for itself. If the music was whack, nobody'd even care to hear anything <b>about</b> <b>no</b> Vanilla Ice. I just think the music is so strong people are kinda comin' out of the closet. It's like, 'You know, hey, I bought it back in the day, and the new stuff is slammin'.' I think there's some hip-hop influenced, stage-diving, body piercing, tattooed white boys out there who are embracing this new sound." [...] "Too Cold" [...] was originally intended to be released as a hidden track or B-side.|$|E
500|$|Like other {{samples of}} Germanophile media, Seara is widely {{alleged to have}} been the {{recipient}} of special propaganda funds from the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. According to historian Lucian Boia, Germanophile newspapers had little room for maneuver, given their unpopular agenda: [...] "of little interest, boycotted and with their offices once in a while assaulted by the 'indignant' public, [...] could never have supported themselves without an infusion of German money." [...] Similarly, researcher Carmen Patricia Reneti argues: [...] "Seara would [...] have been the paper most useful to German propaganda. [...] Minerva and Seara were read by just <b>about</b> <b>no</b> one." [...] Claims of German payments focus on Bogdan-Pitești's shady political dealings, the target of controversy since 1915. Boia notes that the patron, who had no reason for refusing German bribes, may have been genuinely committed to the Germanophile cause, regardless of such additional benefits. Boia also claims that, keeping in with a Romanian tradition of the [...] "baksheesh", the Francophile press may also have received funds from the Entente. Contrarily, historian Ion Bulei argues that [...] "fraudulent wheeler-dealer" [...] Bogdan-Pitești and his [...] "money obsessed" [...] patron were merely directing their support toward the highest bidder. According to various accounts, Bogdan-Pitești was diverting much of his own political payments into increasing his prestigious art collection or supporting his retinue.|$|E
500|$|Gangsta rap {{has been}} criticized for its extreme lyrics, which are often accused of glamorizing gang {{violence}} and black-on-black crime. The Gangsta rappers responded that they were simply describing the realities of life in places such as Compton, California, and Long Beach, California. Describing Doggystyle in 1993, Snoop Doggy Dogg likewise points to the album's realism, {{and the extent to which}} it is based on his personal experience. [...] He said, [...] "I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping <b>about</b> <b>no</b> bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and that's that street life. It's all everyday life, reality." [...] Explaining his intentions, Snoop Doggy Dogg claims he feels he is a role model to many young black men, and that his songs are designed to relate to their concerns. [...] "For little kids growing up in the ghettos," [...] he said, [...] "it's easy to get into the wrong types of things, especially gangbanging and selling drugs. I've seen what that was like, and I don't glorify it, but I don't preach. I bring it to them rather than have them go find out about it for themselves." [...] He further explained the [...] "dream" [...] that he would pursue after making the album: [...] "I'm going to try to eliminate the gang violence. I'll be on a mission for peace. I know I have a lot of power. I know if I say, 'Don't kill', niggas won't kill".|$|E
