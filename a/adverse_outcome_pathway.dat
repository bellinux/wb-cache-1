50|$|Human {{health and}} {{environmental}} risk is the likelihood of an adverse outcome (See <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome</b> <b>pathway).</b> As such, risk {{is a function of}} hazard and exposure. Hazard is the intrinsic danger or harm that is posed, e.g. the toxicity of a chemical compound. Exposure is the likely contact with that hazard. Therefore, the risk of even a very hazardous substance approaches zero as the exposure nears zero, given a person's (or other organism's) biological makeup, activities and location (See exposome). Another example of health risks are when certain behaviors, such as risky sexual behaviors, increase the likelihood of contracting HIV.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>Adverse</b> <b>Outcome</b> <b>Pathways</b> (AOPs) {{is becoming a}} key component of 21 st century toxicology. AOPs provide a conceptual framework that links the molecular initiating event to an <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome</b> through organised toxicological knowledge, bridging the gap from chemistry to toxicological effect. As nuclear receptors (NRs) play essential roles for many physiological processes within the body, they are used regularly as drug targets for therapies to treat many diseases including diabetes, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the heightened {{development of}} NR ligands there is increased need for the identification of related AOPs to facilitate their risk assessment. Many NR ligands have been linked specifically to steatosis. This paper reviews and summarises the role of NR and their importance with links between NR examined to identify plausible putative AOPs. The following NRs are shown to induce hepatic steatosis upon ligand binding: aryl hydrocarbon receptor, constitutive androstane receptor, oestrogen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, farnesoid X receptor, liver X receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, pregnane X receptor, and the retinoic acid receptor.

40|$|Abstract—Incorporation {{of global}} climate change (GCC) effects into {{assessments}} of chemical risk and injury requires integrated examinations of chemical and nonchemical stressors. Environmental variables altered by GCC (temperature, precipitation, salinity, pH) can influence the toxicokinetics of chemical absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion as well as toxicodynamic interactions between chemicals and target molecules. In addition, GCC challenges processes critical for coping with the external environment (water balance, thermoregulation, nutrition, and the immune, endocrine, and neurological systems), leaving organisms sensitive to even slight perturbations by chemicals when pushed to the limits of their physiological tolerance range. In simplest terms, GCC can make organisms more sensitive to chemical stressors, while alternatively, exposure to chemicals can make organisms more sensitive to GCC stressors. One challenge is to identify potential interactions between nonchemical and chemical stressors affecting key physiological processes in an organism. We employed <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome</b> <b>pathways,</b> constructs depicting linkages between mechanism-based molecular initiating events and impacts on individuals or populations, to assess how chemical- and climate-specific variables interact to lead to <b>adverse</b> <b>outcomes.</b> Case examples are presented for prospective scenarios, hypothesizing potential chemical–GCC interactions, and retro...|$|R

As such, AOPs intend {{to provide a}} clear-cut mechanistic representation of pertinent toxicological effects. AOPs are typically composed of a molecular initiating event, a series of intermediate steps and key events, and an <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome.</b> In the current study, an AOP framework is proposed for cholestasis triggered by drug-mediated inhibition of the bile salt export pump transporter protein. For this purpose, an in-depth survey of relevant scientific literature {{was carried out in}} order to identify intermediate steps and key events. The latter include bile accumulation, the induction of oxidative stress and inflammation, and the activation of specific nuclear receptors. Collectively, these mechanisms drive both a deteriorative cellular response, which underlies directly caused cholestatic injury, and an adaptive cellular response, which is aimed at counteracting cholestatic insults. AOP development was performed according to OECD guidance, including critical consideration of the Bradford Hill criteria for weight of evidence assessment and the OECD key questions for evaluating AOP confidence.
