5|$|Bhikshatana {{is often}} {{accompanied}} by women and bhuta-gana (goblin attendants of Shiva). One of the attendants placed {{to the left of}} Bhikshatana should carry <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> used for storing the food alms of Shiva. The women, often seven in number, are variously pictured as enamoured of Shiva, eager to embrace him, blessing him, or serving him food in his begging bowl with a ladle. The clothes of some of these women are slipping from their loins, symbolising their lust. The woman giving Bhikshatana alms is also interpreted as Annapurna, the goddess of grain. Various gods, celestial beings, and sages bow to him with folded hands. In some scenes, the sages are depicted as angry and trying to beat Bhikshatana, alluding to the Deodar Forest legend.|$|E
5|$|On either 10 or 11 June 323BC, Alexander died in {{the palace}} of Nebuchadnezzar II, in Babylon, at age 32. There are two {{different}} versions of Alexander's death and details of the death differ slightly in each. Plutarch's account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral Nearchus, and spent the night and next day drinking with Medius of Larissa. He developed a fever, which worsened until {{he was unable to}} speak. The common soldiers, anxious about his health, were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them. In the second account, Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> of unmixed wine in honour of Heracles, followed by 11 days of weakness; he did not develop a fever and died after some agony. Arrian also mentioned this as an alternative, but Plutarch specifically denied this claim.|$|E

25|$|Ice cream {{was made}} by hand in <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> placed inside a tub filled with ice and salt. This was called the pot-freezer method. French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a sorbetière (a covered pail with a handle {{attached}} to the lid). In the pot-freezer method, {{the temperature of the}} ingredients is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt. The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing latent heat and bringing the mixture below the freezing point of pure water. The immersed container can also make better thermal contact with the salty water and ice mixture than it could with ice alone.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of the fourth day, Talking God and Water Sprinkler {{appeared}} with <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> of white shell and <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> of blue shell. [...] The people gathered around them. [...] They placed the bowls at the water's edge, and started to spin them. [...] The spinning bowls created an opening in the water which led downward to a large house with four rooms. [...] First Man and First Woman traveled down the passage and into the house, and behind them crept the Coyote named First Angry. [...] In the north room of the house, they found Big Water Creature asleep in a chair. [...] Her own two children were there, and also the two missing daughters. [...] First Man and First Woman took the hands of the girls and led them back through the passage and on to the bank. [...] Behind them, Coyote carried the two children of Big Water Creature, wrapped in his big skin coat with white fur lining. [...] There was great celebrating because the lost girls were returned.|$|E
2500|$|Timpani ( [...] ; [...] ) or kettledrums (also informally called timps) are musical {{instruments}} in the percussion family. A type of drum, they consist of a skin called a head stretched over <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> traditionally made of copper. Most modern timpani drums, such as pedal timpani are able to, and are designed to be, tuned easily to specific pitches, often during sections of music; the example being tuned by a movable foot-pedal. They are played by striking {{the head with a}} specialized drum stick called a timpani stick or timpani mallet. Timpani evolved from military drums to become a staple of the classical orchestra by the last third of the 18th century. Today, they are used in many types of ensembles, including concert bands, marching bands, orchestras, and even in some rock.|$|E
2500|$|Smith {{employed}} numerous revolutionary architectural techniques while {{building the}} stadium. At {{the base is}} a slurry wall {{to keep out the}} waters from the Olentangy River; the stadium sets on the flood plain. Instead of building <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> like the previously constructed Yale Bowl, Ohio Stadium was designed to have an upper deck that would hang over part of the lower deck, giving Ohio Stadium its [...] "A", [...] "B", and [...] "C" [...] decks. Instead of employing numerous columns like those at Harvard Stadium, Smith designed double columns that allow for more space between columns. The rotunda {{at the north end of}} the stadium, which is now adorned with stained glass murals of the offensive and defensive squads that comprise the Buckeye football team, was designed to look like the dome at the Pantheon in Rome.|$|E

2500|$|In 1696, Jonathan Dickinson {{witnessed}} {{the use of}} a beverage brewed from the Yaupon Holly among the Ais of Florida. Dickinson later learned that the Spanish called the plant casseena. The Ais parched the leaves in a pot, and then boiled them. The resulting liquid was then transferred to <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> using a gourd that had a long neck with a small hole at the top, and a [...] hole in the side. On the occasion Dickinson witnessed, he estimated that there were nearly three gallons of the beverage in the bowl. After the liquid had cooled, the chief was presented with a conch-shell of the beverage. The chief threw part of it on the ground as a blessing and drank the rest. The chief's associates were then served in turn. Lower status men, women, and children were not allowed to touch or taste the beverage. The chief and his associates sat drinking this brew, smoking and talking for most of the day. In the evening, the bowl that had held the beverage was covered with a skin to make a drum. The Ais, accompanied by the drum and some rattles, sang and danced until the middle of the night.|$|E

As the sugar reserve bowl empties, the operator recharges it with more feedstock. The product is sensitive to humidity, and in humid summer locales, the process can be messy and sticky.|$|R
50|$|Throughout China, in restaurants, it {{is common}} for {{customers}} to clean their bowls and utensils at the table by rinsing them with tea from the pot. Tea may be poured over utensils into one of their <b>bowls,</b> or <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>bowl</b> is may be provided as a waste receptacle for tea used to rinse bowls.

50|$|Cotton candy, {{also known}} as Candy Floss, {{is a form of}} spun sugar. Typical {{machines}} used to make cotton candy include a spinning head enclosing a small bowl into which granulated sugar is poured. Colored sugar or separate sugar and food coloring are used to provide color. Heaters near the rim of the head melt the sugar, which is squeezed out through tiny holes by centrifugal force, and the molten sugar solidifies in the air and is caught in <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>bowl</b> which totally surrounds the spinning head. After the product builds up on the inside walls of the <b>larger</b> <b>bowl,</b> <b>a</b> stick, cone, or hands are inserted, upon which the sugar strands are gathered.|$|R
