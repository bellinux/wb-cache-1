5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the last}} episode, Wirt and Greg wake up in a hospital, with Greg telling a story but being cut off before we can hear what it's about. As the scene ends, Greg's frog begins to glow, due to having eaten a magic bell in The Unknown, {{suggesting}} that there was at least some physical <b>aspect</b> <b>to</b> the story. The series ends with a slow montage of how Wirt and Greg affected the inhabitants of the Unknown.|$|E
5|$|Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer co-led the game's development, {{their first}} time in such a role. The pair carried over {{a limited number of}} {{elements}} from Maniac Mansion and forwent the character selection <b>aspect</b> <b>to</b> simplify development. Inspirations included Chuck Jones cartoons and the history of the United States. Day of the Tentacle is the eighth LucasArts title to use the SCUMM engine.|$|E
5|$|Beat 'em ups often {{allow the}} player {{to choose between}} a {{selection}} of protagonists—each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and set of moves. Attacks can include rapid combinations of basic attacks (combos) as well as jumping and grappling attacks. Characters often have their own special attacks, which leads to different strategies depending on which character the player selects. The control system is usually simple to learn, comprising as little as two buttons. These buttons can be combined to pull off combos, as well as jumping and grappling attacks. Since the release of Double Dragon, many beat 'em ups have allowed two players {{to play the game}} cooperatively—a central <b>aspect</b> <b>to</b> the appeal of these games. Beat 'em ups are more likely to feature cooperative play than other game genres.|$|E

5|$|Dejection was a {{response}} to Wordsworth's Immortality Ode. It conveys feelings of dejection, expressed through an inability to write or appreciate nature. Wordsworth is introduced in the poem as a counterbalance to Coleridge; Wordsworth is able to turn his darkness to benefit and accept comfort. However, Coleridge cannot find any positive <b>aspect</b> <b>to</b> his despair, and is paralyzed by his emotions. The poem captures many of the feelings expressed in his earlier works, including his exploration of a problematic childhood and thoughts on his religious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Klaus Dodds {{has noted}} {{that there is a}} geopolitical <b>aspect</b> <b>to</b> the {{locations}} used, although this is often a pre-emption of an issue by the film. For example, in the first film, Dr. No, the title villain's disruption of the American Project Mercury space launch from Cape Canaveral with his atomic-powered radio beam mirrored claims that American rocket testing at Cape Canaveral had problems with rockets going astray. Similarly Bond's anti-heroin mission in Live and Let Die coincided with President Nixon's 1972 declaration of a War on Drugs, whilst GoldenEye played against the backdrop of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} elements of the painting is the ring on the model's ring finger. Resting on the mantle piece, it becomes a {{focal point of the}} composition. The ring was a device of which Whistler was conscious; it had not been present in The White Girl. Though he and Hiffernan were not married, the ring showed a development in how he represented her in his art; from prostitute in Wapping, to mistress in The White Girl, and finally a wife in The Little White Girl. At the same time, this development reflected Whistler's notion of his own position in the English art world: towards greater legitimacy. The ring is also an allusion to the Christian sacrament of marriage, which lends a religious <b>aspect</b> <b>to</b> the aestheticism that he and Swinburne were trying to develop.|$|E

5|$|Pixar and Disney had {{disagreements}} {{after the}} production of Toy Story 2 (1999). Originally intended as a straight-to-video release (and thus not part of Pixar's three-picture deal), the film was eventually upgraded to a theatrical release during production. Pixar demanded that the film then be counted toward the three-picture agreement, but Disney refused. Though profitable for both, Pixar later complained that the arrangement was not equitable. Pixar was responsible for creation and production, while Disney handled marketing and distribution. Profits and production costs were split 50-50, but Disney exclusively owned all story and sequel rights and also collected a 10- to 15-percent distribution fee. The lack of story and sequel rights {{was perhaps the most}} onerous <b>aspect</b> <b>to</b> Pixar and {{set the stage for a}} contentious relationship.|$|E
5|$|Who's Your City? was {{intended}} to be a self-help book, based on scholarly research and an academic theory, that provided a reader the mental framework necessary to match their personality and life situation with the optimum city to reside. Florida drew upon his past research on the geographical aspects of wealth generation and locational decisions of members of the creative class, as well as theories and opinions of other academics, like Jane Jacobs, and even those who have been critical of Florida's work, like Tim Harford. New research included a psychological <b>aspect</b> <b>to</b> his theory. Maps, graphs, tables, and indices illustrate the text.|$|E
5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film {{can be seen as}} having another loose <b>aspect</b> <b>to</b> labor issues. The film directly followed first Thanhouser film to address the subject: The Girl Strike Leader. The film loosely refers labor relations when Jack Hunt is killed in a riot while on strike duty and the young widow is struggles to make ends meet. Thanhouser subjects would deal with other pressing social issues in The Girls of the Ghetto, another July 1910 release. The plot of The Lucky Shot employed the deus ex machina technique to resolve the financial needs of the widow and her child. Another plot of a needy family suddenly finding a concealed fortune within their house would be reused in The Thunderbolt. The film director and the cameraman are unknown and the only credits known for the cast is that of Marie Eline as the little boy and Mrs. George W. Walters {{in the role of the}} miserly woman. Other members cast may have included the other leading players of the Thanhouser productions, Anna Rosemond, Frank H. Crane and Violet Heming.|$|E

5|$|With the {{demolition}} of the workhouse, however, Barry was able to build the Gallery's first sequence of grand architectural spaces, from 1872 to 1876. Built to a polychrome Neo-Renaissance design, the Barry Rooms were arranged on a Greek cross-plan around a huge central octagon. Though it compensated for the underwhelming architecture of the Wilkins building, Barry's new wing was disliked by Gallery staff, who considered its monumental <b>aspect</b> <b>to</b> be in conflict with its function as exhibition space. Also, the decorative programme of the rooms did not take their intended contents into account; {{the ceiling of the}} 15th- and 16th-century Italian gallery, for instance, was inscribed with the names of British artists of the 19th century. But despite these failures, the Barry Rooms provided the Gallery with a strong axial groundplan. This was to be followed by all subsequent additions to the Gallery for a century, resulting in a building of clear symmetry.|$|E
