The second chorus has her gazing through a fashion boutique, admiring several pairs of heels. By the bridge section, sparks fall from the sky and are seen behind Amuro as she looks upwards.

500|$|Doofenshmirtz, {{back at his}} lair, ties Perry to a giant firecracker rocket, {{explaining}} that he will end the party with fireworks and kill Perry at the same time. When Vanessa arrives, however, she hates the [...] "girly" [...] theme Doofenshmirtz has chosen <b>and</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> to mope at a table, fearing that this would embarrass {{her in front of}} her arriving goth friends. At Phineas and Ferb's house, Love Händel's rehearsal descends into infighting; sure that no one will want to hear them any more, the band are again on the verging of breaking up when they hear the roar of the crowd. Meanwhile, Doofenshmirtz mopes of failing another attempt of giving Vanessa a good party, so he decides to ignite Perry's rocket to cheer himself up, but Perry frees himself and a fight ensues, during which Doofenshmirtz becomes tied to the rocket by accident instead. At the same moment the band begins to play; Candace and Linda arrive home.

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{telling a story}} about a very famous Hollywood actress named Lucky. Lucky is seen wearing a pink nightgown behind the curtains, {{standing}} on her billboard with fluffy white cotton balls attached to the edges, inside her mansion and shots of her out on the balcony. As beautiful and rich as she is, on set she sits on the star-shape in the sky, as she is acting, she is looking quite distressed. After the first chorus, she goes to the hotel mansion to the flowers, then she leaves <b>and</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> and gets a mirror. Next, Lucky opens the door to reveal a handsome man, who then takes her in his arms, as the director yells [...] "Cut! We've got it". Lucky then walks off-set into the studio, replying to the director: [...] "Finally! We've done it fifty-million times!" [...] She then goes to have her hair and makeup done; with Spears standing unnoticed and very worried looking by her side. Lucky is then seen in a shiny gray evening gown at the Academy Awards accepting her award for Best Actress. Lucky looks happy as she accepts it and smiles at her fans but is soon revealed that this is not true happiness. She makes her way away from her screaming fans and back into her limo, where she unexpectedly finds an ornate hand mirror that was used on the film set. She looks back to the crowd to see who has left it and sees Spears leaning forward in the crowd. The limo drives away, leaving Spears behind on the red carpet. The video ends with Lucky crying herself to sleep, her make-up already stained on her face. The curtains close, ending the video.|$|E
500|$|Later on, Meg knocks Brian out, {{puts him}} {{in the trunk of}} his car and drives away. Chris tells Lois that he saw this, so Lois, Peter, Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire track them down at the Barrington Hotel. When they arrive, they see Meg has tied Brian up with {{packaging}} tape and is about to rape Brian. Lois tells Meg that she is not thinking right, although Meg insists that she has never been more sure of anything in her life. Lois struggles to explain and says Meg does not know what she needs, and then Quagmire says (in an erotic tone) [...] "I know what she needs... Bring her by my house around 8:30 tonight I'll take care of her." [...] This implies that he will try to take advantage of Meg and when she arrives at Quagmire's house, it seems even more likely; he tells her to sit down and says [...] "Soon it'll all become clear", puts on seductive music, dims the lights, strips down to a speedo <b>and</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> beside her; but suddenly, Quagmire (uncharacteristically) begins to have a serious heart-to-heart talk with Meg, telling her that her entire life is still ahead of her and she should not be in such a hurry to grow up before assuring her that she will find the right person one day. To help Meg, Quagmire gives her his copy of The Missing Piece to help give her a better perception of things, and sends her away feeling much better. He then walks into his bedroom, where two of his one-night stands await with an array of sex toys, {{and it turns out that}} all of Quagmire's seemingly erotic antics were actually in preparation for this tryst. One of the women asks Quagmire if he has the [...] "hwhip" [...] (with emphasis on the [...] "h") and Quagmire responds with disbelief.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} of Ann Hopkins is then introduced when she surreptitiously {{walks into the}} restaurant <b>and</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> with a pastor. Ann Hopkins is likened to Ann Woodward. Ina Coolbirth relates {{the story of how}} Mrs. Hopkins ended up murdering her husband. When he threatened to divorce her, she began cultivating a rumour that a burglar was harassing their neighbourhood. The official police report says that while {{she and her husband were}} sleeping in separate bedrooms, Mrs. Hopkins heard someone enter her bedroom. In her panic, she grabbed her gun and shot the intruder; unbeknownst to her the intruder was in fact her husband, David Hopkins (or William Woodward, Jr.). Ina Coolbirth suggests however, that Mr. Hopkins was in fact shot in the shower; such is the wealth and power of the Hopkins' family that any charges or whispers of murder simply floated away at the inquest. It is rumoured that Ann Woodward was warned prematurely of the publication and content of Capote's [...] "La Côte Basque", and proceeded to kill herself with an overdose of sleeping pills as a result.|$|E
2500|$|Stunt {{performer}} Dick Warlock played Michael Myers (as in Halloween, {{listed as}} [...] "The Shape" [...] in the credits), replacing Castle who was beginning {{a career as}} a director. Warlock's previous experience in film was as a stunt double in films, such as The Green Berets (1968) and Jaws (1975), and the 1974 television series [...] In an interview, Warlock explained how he prepared for the role since Myers received far more screen time in the sequel than the original. Warlock said, where Laurie is huddled in the closet. Michael breaks through. She grabs a hanger and thrusts it up and into his eyes. Michael falls down and Laurie walks to the bedroom doorway <b>and</b> <b>sits</b> <b>down.</b> In the background, we see Michael sit up and turn towards her to the beat of the music. ... Anyway, that and the head tilt were the things I carried with me into Halloween II. I didn't really see that much more to hang my hat on in the first film. Warlock also claims that the mask he wore was the same one Nick Castle used in the first film. Hill confirmed this in an interview.|$|E
