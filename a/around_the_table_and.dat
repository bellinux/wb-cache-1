500|$|Drummer Mullen said of {{the song}} in 1983:"We're into the {{politics}} of people, we're not into politics. Like you talk about Northern Ireland, 'Sunday Bloody Sunday,' people sort of think, 'Oh, that time when 13 Catholics were shot by British soldiers'; that's not what the song is about. That's an incident, the most famous incident in Northern Ireland and it's the strongest way of saying, 'How long? How long {{do we have to}} put up with this?' I don't care who's who – Catholics, Protestants, whatever. You know people are dying every single day through bitterness and hate, and we're saying why? What's the point? And you can move that into places like El Salvador and other similar situations – people dying. Let's forget the politics, let's stop shooting each other and sit <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> talk about it... There are a lot of bands taking sides saying politics is crap, etc. Well, so what! The real battle is people dying, that's the real battle." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{production}} first started, Clement and {{his crew}} would spend six hours applying Haley's make-up; eventually, the crew was able to streamline their process. According to Haley, the make-up crew would apply individual prosthetics to him, from his head {{all the way down}} his back, which were glued to his body. The appliances were then blended together to create a seamless appearance. Haley spent approximately three hours and twenty minutes in the make-up chair to apply the prosthetics, each day; on occasion, it would take almost four and a half hours when the crew needed to apply the prosthetic skull cap, which Haley did not need to worry about most days as he was able to wear the fedora hat on top of his head. Haley also had to wear contact lenses, one that was bloody and another that was cloudy, with the latter one making it difficult for the actor to see out of. Haley also had to work on developing Freddy's [...] "voice" [...] for the film. According to Haley, the process of coming up with the perfect voice for Freddy is [...] "this organic process of embodying the character", and not about just [...] "sitting <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> going, 'Let me try this voice and this voice'". Haley and Bayer admitted that some of the voice would be digitally enhanced in the end to give it a [...] "supernatural quality" [...] and get it away from the voice Haley used as Rorschach in Watchmen.|$|E

Waiters will serve diners with cups, a basin for rinsing cutlery and offer them a tally card when they successfully get a seat. Moreover, due to the popularity of the restaurant, diners are expected to share a table.|$|R

2500|$|Brown is a Christian. He says, I'm not a spooky snake handler because I live in Georgia and I'm Christian, that I {{believe in}} the Bible, that I travel with the Bible, that I read the Bible every day. I'm still me. I'm still a guy doing a job. I find, actually, that people ask me a lot about it. I don't hit people {{over the head with}} the Bible ... I still feel a funny little tinge in my stomach when I'm out to dinner with my wife and {{daughter}} in New York. We'll go to dinner and we'll be sitting <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> we'll say Grace. You know what? People are going to stare at you. I used to feel really self-conscious. But I've gotten to a point where I think, nah, I'm not going to feel bad about that. I'm not going to apologize about that. Brown said in a December 2014 interview in Time that he [...] "could no longer abide the Southern Baptist Convention's indoctrination of children and its anti-gay stance" [...] adding that he's now [...] "searching for a new belief system." ...|$|E

60|$|So Rollo, {{taking out}} half a paul from his pocket,--that being {{the price of}} {{admission}} to the reading room for a single day,--and giving it to the clerk at the desk, opened a door {{by the side of the}} desk, and passed into the reading room. Instead of being only one reading room, however, he found that there were two, with an open door leading from one to the other. There were a great number of very comfortable sofas and arm chairs all about these rooms, <b>and</b> great <b>tables</b> in <b>the</b> middle of them covered with newspapers and magazines. The walls of both rooms were completely covered with paintings of all sizes, most of which had been left there for sale. There were a great many gentlemen sitting <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>and</b> upon <b>the</b> sofas, reading. Among them Rollo soon found Mr. George. He had established himself in a comfortable arm chair, near a great window that looked out upon the square. But he was obliged to keep the curtain down, on account of the beggars outside, that gave him no peace as long as they could see him.|$|R
60|$|We seated {{ourselves}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> Mr. Fothergill, producing two {{packs of}} cards from his pocket, began to deal.

60|$|But Diana and {{her small}} fry, the Echo Lodge {{people and the}} Allans, had stayed to help the two old ladies over the {{loneliness}} of the first evening; and they contrived to have a quietly pleasant little supper time, sitting long <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> chatting over {{all the details of}} the day.

50|$|A new, modern McDonald's {{was built}} across the street, {{replacing}} a Howard Johnson's restaurant (then Ground Round). At this McDonald's {{there are a}} half dozen glass-enclosed exhibits arrayed <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables,</b> including red <b>and</b> white tiles from the original restaurant and string ties worn by employees from the 1950s to the early 1970s.|$|R
40|$|Four men, {{possibly}} William M.

Rice Institute on April 14 - 15, 1950. Original resource is a black and white photograph...|$|R
60|$|He unfastened {{the belt}} {{and drew the}} pouch from its hiding place. He was alone. The balance of the camp, save the sentries, had retired--none would enter the Belgian's tent. He fingered the pouch, feeling out the shapes and sizes of the precious, little nodules within. He hefted the bag, first in one palm, then in the other, and at last he wheeled his chair slowly <b>around</b> before <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> rays of his small lamp let the {{glittering}} gems roll out upon the rough wood.|$|R
60|$|But I had my bearings. Feeling my way <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> bumping {{most of the}} {{poisoned}} {{breath out}} of me against the rotund-bellied stove, I emerged in the cross-hall and {{made my way to}} starboard. Here, {{at the base of the}} chart-room stairway, I gained the hall that led aft. By this time my own situation seemed so serious that, careless of any collision, I went aft in long leaps.|$|E
60|$|Dunwoodie whispered {{his orders}} {{in the ear}} of a subaltern, and motioned to the peddler to withdraw. The {{interruption}} caused by this scene prevented further enjoyment <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> the officers dispersed to their several places of rest.

6000|$|... "Environment," [...] said Hetty. [...] "That's {{what did}} it. When I {{first went to}} New York I was very young. A {{newspaper}} man took me out to dinner {{and asked me to}} have a cocktail. I looked <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>and</b> saw other girls drinking cocktails, so I took one. That was where I turned into the rocky road. People get careless <b>around</b> <b>the</b> newspaper offices. They work under a constant nervous strain and find that drink steadies them--for a time. By and by they disappear; others take their places, and they are never heard of again except in the police courts. I knew a girl, society editor of a big paper, who drew her five thousand a year, at one time. She got the cocktail habit and a week or so ago I paid her fine for getting pinched while intoxicated. She was in rags and hadn't a red cent. That set me thinking, and when Tommy fired me from his paper and said the best he could do was to get me a job in the country, it seemed as if my chance to turn over a new leaf had arrived. I've turned it," [...] she added, with a pathetic sigh; [...] "but whether it'll stay turned, or not, is a question for the puzzle page." ...|$|R
5000|$|At the [...] "time for matins", {{usually in}} {{practice}} at the stroke of midnight, <b>the</b> priest censes <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Holy <b>Table,</b> <b>and</b> lights his candle from the unsleeping flame. The Holy Doors are opened, after which the priest exclaims [...] "Come receive {{the light from the}} light that is never overtaken by night, and glorify Christ, Who is risen from the dead!" [...] or a similar variation depending on tradition. After this proclamation, the priest approaches the congregation with the Paschal trikirion (lit from the unsleeping flame), and the people light their candles from the flame.|$|R
