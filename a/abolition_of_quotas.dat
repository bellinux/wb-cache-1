50|$|To avoid {{excessive}} burdens {{on trade and}} customs, as of April 1, 2005, all garments and fabrics will trade freely into the European Union (EU). Although the quotas have been eliminated, the regulation also sets up a statistical monitoring system for the imports of textiles and clothing into the EU. This system is to provide information regarding the chance of market disruptions and will allow for the governing body to closely follow the trade in this new environment. This regulation is beneficial for Canadian clothing and fabric manufacturers because now there are fewer restrictions. It is hoped by some that this ruling will open up the European market in the near future. Benefits of the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>quotas</b> are also expected to textile companies in India and Pakistan.|$|E
40|$|A pervasive, {{yet little}} {{acknowledged}} feature of international migration to developed countries is that newly arriving immigrants are increasingly highly skilled. This paper analyses the factors affecting {{the change in}} the skill composition of immigrants in Switzerland between 1980 and 2010 using a framework suggested by Grogger & Hanson (2011). Our findings suggest that improved schooling in origin countries of immigrants and a shift in the relative demand for highly educated workers in destinations stand out as the two most important drivers. Yet, while improved schooling would predict only a modest increase in the share of highly educated immigrants and a large increase of middle educated immigrants, we show that demand shifts associated with computerisation are crucial to understand why the share of highly educated immigrants increased sharply while the share of middle educated workers merely stabilised. Additionally, our framework allows evaluating the effect of changes in immigration policy. We find that the recent <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>quotas</b> for workers from European countries through a bilateral agreement with the EU in 2002 had a small but negative effect on the educational quality of immigrants...|$|E
40|$|After nearly 20 {{years of}} central European {{management}} {{the fishing industry}} is deep in crisis, a point emphasised by Scottish demersal fishermen during a study that investigated the breadth of their knowledge and its potential application to fisheries management.

However, if implemented a 'days at sea' scheme would bring additional conditions, unfavoured and unconsidered by the fishermen.

30|$|However, {{empirical}} evidence on how liberalization of migration among more economically integrated and developed European countries affects the skill composition of immigrants is sparse. Based on survey data on immigrants who arrived between 1988 and 2002, Huber and Bock-Schappelwein (2014) find that after Austria {{became a member}} of the EEA in 1994, the share of permanent migrants from the EEA to Austria with low education levels dropped compared to the change in the share of low-educated permanent migrants from other countries. They therefore argued that liberalizing migration may be an effective way to improve the skill structure of immigrants in countries that have a high share of low-skilled immigrants. By contrast, Beerli and Indergand (2014) find that the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>quotas</b> for workers from European countries through a bilateral agreement with the EU in 2002 had a small but negative effect on the educational quality of immigrants to Switzerland. They attribute this decline to more selective immigration policies before 2002, which in turn stem from higher returns to education in Switzerland. The differing experiences of the two countries indicate that pre-reform migration patterns are quite important for understanding how liberalization changes migration flows.|$|E
40|$|Textile and {{clothing}} (T 2 ̆ 6 C) manufacture {{is often a}} country 2 ̆ 7 s first step {{on the road to}} industrialisation, and thus a critically important sector of international trade for developing countries and least developed countries (LDCs). A long-standing system of quotas - established outside the GATT norms, primarily to protect developed economies, and expanded throughout {{the latter half of the}} twentieth century - was abolished in 2005. This event launched a major shift in the workings of this area of world trade. This book explores the impact of this seminal event.

40|$|A pervasive, {{yet little}} {{acknowledged}} feature of international migration to developed countries is that newly arriving immigrants are increasingly highly skilled since the 1980 s. This paper analyses {{the determinants of}} changes in the skill composition of immigrants using a framework suggested by Grogger & Hanson (2011). We focus on Switzerland, which continuously showed very high immigration rates and dramatic changes in the skill composition of immigrants. In addition, the recent integration of Switzerland into the European labour market in 2002 serves as a policy experiment which allows analysing the influence of a reduction on immigration restrictions on immigrants from European countries in comparison to those from other countries. Our findings suggest that changes of education supply in origin countries and shifts to the relative demand for education groups stand out as the two most important drivers. Yet, while supply alone predicts only a modest increase in the case of highly educated workers and a large increase of middle educated workers, one particular demand channel, the polarisation of labour demand induced by the adoption of computer capital, is crucial to explain the sharp increase in highly educated workers and the mere stabilisation of the share of middle educated immigrant workers. The <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>quotas</b> for EU residents played a smaller role, yet may have slightly reduced the high skill share among immigrants relative to immigrants from other countries...|$|E

Globally, the largest producer and exporter of grass and legume seeds is America (USA), which is followed by the block of European Union (EU 15) countries, Canada and New Zealand. Grass seeds vastly produced are from annual and perennial varieties of ryegrasses, and much of the production is consumed within the various production regions, particularly by the USA and within the EU (Wong 2005). Ryegrass production has high returns, and consumers, as compared to producers, are purchasing the most grass seeds as they tend to purchase coated seeds so as to increase water retention or seeds enclosed in mulch which makes planting easier (Paul 2013). In the USA, Oregon State produces about a third of the grass seed on the world market and its grass seed industry has had success in China. Together with other actors, it was involved in the development of the Chinese grass seed market. Its initial aim was to help Chinese grassland specialists apply modern techniques to grassland problems such as soil erosion (Durham et al. 2003). In Ireland, new technology in the grass seed market is driven by the opening up of beef export markets in China and the United States, the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>quotas</b> and the Irish government’s publicized commitment to increasing dairy output (Moran 2015).|$|E
40|$|The authors {{provide a}} simple {{introduction}} to {{the economics of the}} Multifibre Arrangement (MFA) and use available empirical evidence to examine its impact on exports of garments and textiles, focusing on India. Their review of the basic economics of the MFA shows the discriminatory character of the Arrangement. While exporting countries can gain from quota rents, much of this gain is likely to be offset by losses in exports to unrestricted markets, through waste resulting from domestic rent-seeking behavior, or shared with industrial country importers. Moreover, the restrictions curtail the ability of countries to generate sorely needed employment in the labor-intensive garment and textile sectors. Recent estimates for India of the export tax equivalents of the quotas suggest that they increased in 1999, {{after a couple of years}} around lower levels. The authors also examine the domestic policy distortions affecting the industry in India. While the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>quotas</b> on international trade in textiles in 2005 will create opportunities for developing countries, it will also expose them to additional competition from other, formerly restrained exporters. The outcome for any country will depend on its policy response. Countries that use the opportunity to streamline their policies and improve their competitiveness are likely to increase their gains from quota abolition. Modeling results suggest that South Asia as a whole will gain from quota abolition, although different countries may experience different results. Unambiguously, however, the gains from domestic reform will increase after the abolition of the quota arrangement.

40|$|Milk {{in terms}} of {{production}} value has the second biggest share in Croatian agricultural sector in 2013 (CBS, 2014). It could be speculated that after the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>quotas</b> in the European Union, the declining trend in domestic production will continue and that exposure to free European market will significantly affect the competitiveness of domestic production. The aim {{of this paper is}} to analyse the prospects of Croatian dairy industry (sector) under certain conditions of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and to present projections simulated with the help of partial equilibrium model AGMEMOD. The main model inputs are policy and macroeconomic variables, supply-use balances of agro-food products and producer prices. The Baseline projections has shown that in 2025 in line with the CAP implementation there might be a decrease of dairy cows number by 33 %, the raw milk price by 14 % and the collected cow’s milk amount by 13 % compared to the five-year average of 2008 - 2012. The positive effect was noted in productivity, according to the simulation, with an increase by 25 %, which consequently may lead to increased deliveries to dairies for about 17 %. Therefore preliminary results show that accounting for milk processing the dairy sector in Croatia might obtain a favourable situation by 2025. Taking into account the EU market situation, there is an opportunity to increase milk processing given the current level of prices in the EU market and global markets, and taking into account the abolition of milk quotas. Also, the results suggest, according to the experience of other states, that the utilization of funds of 1 st and 2 nd pillar of the CAP (utilization measures across projects) in order to improve the production structure and efficiency will play an important role...|$|E

The Sourcing Share of Asia increased dramatically especially since Chinas participation in the WTO in 2005 which led to the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>quotas.</b> India, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Malaysia and the Philippines also play a major role in the Asian Textile and Garment Market. But even so, West Europe, the Mediterranean Rim and the East European Countries still play an important role on the global textile and apparel market, maybe no longer from the volume perspective but in terms of variety, complexity and product quality, particularly for the more demanding markets. Latin America has seen a significant decline over the last decade but is developing similar strategies like Europe to compete through quality and specialty niche rather than volume. Does this mean that the West European Apparel Industry is dead? The European Textile and Garment industry has undergone a severe decline since 1970 which nearly made it extinct in some of the EU founding economies. The labour intensive manufacturing segment which is almost not existent in Western Europe today particularly suffered. The only uncritical area where specifically one country in Western Europe is still defending its share, possibly due to changed sourcing practices and a recently increased presence on the global marketplace is the textile sector in Italy, which has even seen a rise in both volumes and employees over the last decade...|$|E
