5|$|Like most Proteaceae, T.truncata has fine proteoid {{roots that}} arise from larger roots. These are roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form <b>a</b> <b>mat</b> in the soil just below the leaf litter. They are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, including the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. Waratah seeds are often eaten—and destroyed—by animals and do not travel far (just several metres) from the parent plants.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.ericifolia has proteoid roots—roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form <b>a</b> <b>mat</b> {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. The species lacks a lignotuber, and so is killed by fire and regenerates from seed.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.integrifolia has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form <b>a</b> <b>mat</b> {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, thus allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. Studies on B.integrifolia suggest that its proteoid root mat achieves this by chemically modifying its soil environment.|$|E

40|$|Background: We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the validity of duplex ultrasonography (DUS) using a microconvex array transducer (MAT) with enhanced flow imaging (EFI) for visualization of the distal, internal carotid artery (ICA) and the accurate assessment of ICA stenosis. Methods: Patients who underwent both DUS and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were registered for this study. DUS was performed by using a linear array transducer (LAT) and <b>an</b> <b>MAT</b> with EFI. The visibility of the ICA was compared between the 2 transducers. ICA stenosis was evaluated by the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) method on DUS, and the peak systolic flow velocity (PSV) was evaluated by using <b>an</b> <b>MAT.</b> These results were compared with DSA. Results: In 238 internal carotid arteries, {{the average length of}} visualized ICA was longer for DUS using <b>an</b> <b>MAT</b> than <b>an</b> LAT (38. 7 ± 11. 7 mm versus 25. 8 ± 9. 8 mm, P <. 0001). In 68 stenotic, internal carotid arteries, the degree of ICA stenosis detected by the NASCET method on DUS was correlated to that on DSA (P <. 0001, r =. 969, and adjusted r 2 =. 938). PSV also correlated to NASCET method on DSA (P <. 0001, r =. 804, and adjusted r 2 =. 640). Conclusions: DUS using <b>an</b> <b>MAT</b> with EFI technology could reveal more extended distal views of the ICA and was strongly correlated with NASCET method on DSA...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The medial axis {{transform}} (MAT) {{has potential}} {{as an alternative}} representation for certain design and modeling problems. To exploit this potential, however, {{it is essential that}} the boundary of the object which <b>an</b> <b>MAT</b> represents be easily determined. For two-dimensional objects, the MAT consists of curves in three-space. Given <b>a</b> valid <b>MAT,</b> that is, <b>a</b> set of curves which comprise the <b>MAT</b> of <b>a</b> valid boundary as defined below, the boundary points related to any particular point on the MAT can be found, based solely on the MAT point and the tangent(s) to the MAT at the point. In this work, we demonstrate the relationship between the MAT tangent and the boundary points which forms the basis of this conversion. We also show a smoothness property of the MAT, and detail the requirements for a graph in threespace to be <b>a</b> valid <b>MAT.</b> We provide <b>an</b> error bound which shows how errors in <b>a</b> computed <b>MAT</b> relate to errors in the generated boundary. Finally we discuss our implemen...|$|R

5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.epica has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form <b>a</b> <b>mat</b> {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter.

5|$|Arab and Islamic {{influences}} strongly mark Antemoro culture.

Harefo reeds were woven to form mats (tafitsihy) that were sewn together to form jackets and tunics (with long sleeves for older men); a loincloth made of fanto (beaten barkcloth) was worn beneath the ensemble. Women wore sleeveless sheath dresses made from two or three reed mats sewn together and belted at the waist or drawn over one shoulder. Adolescent and adult women often also wore <b>a</b> <b>mat</b> bandeau or halter top. It was historically forbidden for women to wear lambas made of cotton or any other material than woven raffia mats, as it was believed this could render them more attractive to men outside their clan, with whom they were forbidden to marry.|$|E

5|$|Most Proteaceae and all Banksia species, {{including}} B.aemula, have proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters of}} short lateral rootlets that form <b>a</b> <b>mat</b> {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These roots are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. A study of six wallum species, including B.aemula, found they have adapted to very low levels of phosphorus and are highly sensitive to increased levels of the element, leading to phosphorus toxicity. Some evidence suggests they are efficient at using potassium, and sensitive to calcium toxicity as well. A field study on North Stradbroke Island noted increased root growth in autumn (around April), but that overall root growth was more constant than other species looked at, possibly because its deeper roots had more regular access to groundwater.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the sublingua in lemurs {{was thought}} to be a vestigial organ {{inherited}} from their mammalian ancestors. In lemuriform primates, the sublingua is used to remove hair and debris from the highly specialized toothcomb, an arrangement of four or six long, forward-facing teeth in the lower jaw used in oral grooming. The toothcomb of lemuriforms consists of both incisors and canine teeth (which reinforce the incisors), and together, these finely spaced teeth act like teeth on a comb. Although the cleaning function has been suspected for nearly a century, there has been no clear confirmation of this. However, a study from 1941 presented evidence that the toothcomb accumulated <b>a</b> <b>mat</b> of hair during oral grooming, and the author did observe that lemurs extend and retract their tongue rapidly, possibly to use the sublingua to clean the toothcomb.|$|E
5|$|Rhythm game or rhythm {{action is}} a genre of music-themed action video game that {{challenges}} a player's sense of rhythm. Games in the genre typically focus on dance or the simulated performance of musical instruments, and require players to press buttons in a sequence dictated on the screen. Doing so causes the game's protagonist or avatar to dance or to play their instrument correctly, which increases the player's score. Many rhythm games include multiplayer modes in which players compete for the highest score or cooperate as a simulated musical ensemble. While conventional control pads {{may be used as}} input devices, rhythm games often feature novel game controllers that emulate musical instruments. Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on <b>a</b> <b>mat,</b> with pressure-sensitive pads acting as the input device.|$|E
