40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model for}} understanding a firm's decisions regarding the maintenance (renewal) and patenting of sequential innovations and studies how these decisions {{are affected by the}} model's parameters, including maintenance fees and filing fees. The model demonstrates that the two prices exert negative effects on renewal and patenting, respectively (i. e. adverse own price effects). The model also offers a discriminating testable hypothesis, predicted on the cross-price effects, to identify complementarity or substitutability across sequential innovations. Our regression results show that the probability of patent renewal and maintenance fees are correlated negatively and that the patent propensity and <b>application</b> <b>fees</b> are correlated negatively. We also demonstrate that higher <b>application</b> <b>fees</b> are associated with lower probability of patent renewal, which corroborates the case of complementarity in sequential innovations.

25|$|Slovakia {{has several}} privately funded {{universities}}, however public universities consistently score {{better in the}} ranking than their private counterparts. Universities have different criteria for accepting students. Anyone can apply to any number of universities. The limiting factor {{is the cost of}} application fees, which can range from a few € to over 100 € per one application. The student may apply for a social discount for the <b>application</b> <b>fee.</b> Several universities, including some the best ranking in Slovakia, accept all applicants and perform a screening process during the study, which results in a higher dropout rate among the students compared to universities that require passing an entry exam. Other methods of acceptance may include weighting past study results from high school, passing an entry test or a combination of both.|$|E

40|$|In an {{application}} game, agents {{decide whether to}} apply for the prize, and reviewing applica- tions allows the decision maker to learn agent qualifications and award prizes to qualified agents. The decision maker finds reviewing applications costly, and prefers not to review applications from agents with sufficiently low probability of being qualified. Positive <b>application</b> <b>fees</b> and time delays can assure that only those with a high-enough probability of being qualified apply for prizes. Applied to the journal submission process, in which tenured and untenured academic authors are affected differently by time delays, the model shows that using time delays instead of higher submission fees benefits tenured authors at the expense of both untenured authors and journal quality. Applied to the process of applying for a permit when there are both rich and poor potential applicants, the model shows that the decision maker should impose both <b>application</b> <b>fees</b> and time delays (e. g., red tape). In this case, eliminating fees benefits poor agents, while it harms rich agents and the decision maker; eliminating red tape benefits rich agents, while it harms poor agents and the decision maker. journal submission, red tape, <b>application</b> <b>fees...</b>|$|R
