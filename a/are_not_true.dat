5|$|H3 and H6 do {{not share}} such a convincing suite of Heinrich event {{symptoms}} as events H1, H2, H4, and H5, which has led some researchers {{to suggest that they}} <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> Heinrich events.

5|$|Sebaceous cyst is a {{term used}} to refer to both an epidermoid cyst and a pilar cyst, though neither of these contain sebum, only keratin and do not {{originate}} in the sebaceous gland and so <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> sebaceous cysts. A true sebaceous cyst is relatively rare and is known as a steatocystoma.|$|E
50|$|Assume {{there is}} an n such that Sn is true. Then Sn + 1 <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true,</b> so there <b>is</b> some k > n + 1 such that Sk is <b>true.</b> But Sk <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> because Sn <b>is</b> true and k > n. Assuming Sn is true implies a contradiction, Sk <b>is</b> <b>true</b> and <b>not</b> <b>true,</b> so our {{assumption}} is absurd. We must conclude for each i, the sentence Si <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true.</b> But if Si <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true,</b> it <b>is</b> also true, so we have the paradox that each sentence in Yablo's list <b>is</b> <b>true</b> and <b>not</b> <b>true.</b>|$|R

60|$|Thus it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> {{that the}} {{historical}} succession of the divisions of mathematics has corresponded with {{the order of}} decreasing generality. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> that abstract mathematics was evolved antecedently to, and independently of concrete mathematics. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> that of the subdivisions of abstract mathematics, the more general came before the more special.

5|$|Extinct North American cats {{resembling}} the cheetah had historically {{been assigned to}} Felis, Puma or Acinonyx. However, a phylogenetic analysis in 1990 placed these species under the genus Miracinonyx. Miracinonyx exhibited {{a high degree of}} similarity with the cheetah. However, in 1998, a DNA analysis showed that Miracinonyx inexpectatus, M.studeri, and M.trumani (early to late Pleistocene epoch), found in North America, <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> cheetahs; in fact, they are close relatives of the cougar.|$|E
5|$|The {{wood turtle}} {{takes a long}} time to reach sexual maturity, has a low {{fecundity}} (ability to reproduce), but has a high adult survival rate. However, the high survival rates <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> of juveniles or hatchlings. Although males establish hierarchies, they are not territorial. The wood turtle becomes sexually mature between 14 and 18 years of age. Mating activity among wood turtles peaks in the spring and again in the fall, although it is known to mate throughout the portion of the year they are active. However, it has been observed mating in December. In one rare instance, a female wood turtle hybridized with a male Blanding's turtle.|$|E
5|$|Their feet {{have four}} long toes and an opposable big toe. Orangutans can grasp things with both {{their hands and}} their feet. Their fingers and toes are curved, {{allowing}} them {{to get a better}} grip on branches. Since their hip joints have the same flexibility as their shoulder and arm joints, orangutans have less restriction in the movements of their legs than humans have. Unlike gorillas and chimpanzees, orangutans <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> knuckle-walkers, and are instead fist-walkers.|$|E

5|$|The {{muscles and}} nerves are much simpler {{than those of}} most other animals, {{although}} more specialised than in other cnidarians, such as corals. Cells in the outer layer (epidermis) and the inner layer (gastrodermis) have microfilaments that group into contractile fibers. These fibers <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> muscles {{because they are not}} freely suspended in the body cavity as they are in more developed animals. Longitudinal fibres are found in the tentacles and oral disc, and also within the mesenteries, where they can contract the whole length of the body. Circular fibers are found in the body wall and, in some species, around the oral disc, allowing the animal to retract its tentacles into a protective sphincter.|$|E
5|$|Intentionality is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (about) or be in relation with something in the external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> or false, they simply happen. It would not {{make any sense to}} say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that he}} was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.|$|E

50|$|If (B) {{is neither}} true nor false, {{then it must}} <b>be</b> <b>not</b> <b>true.</b> Since this <b>is</b> what (B) itself states, it means that (B) must be true. Since {{initially}} (B) <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> and <b>is</b> now true, another paradox arises.|$|R
