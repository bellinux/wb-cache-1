5|$|A {{feature-length film}} that {{indirectly}} parodies Star Trek is Galaxy Quest. This film {{is based on}} the premise that aliens monitoring the broadcast of an Earth-based TV series called Galaxy Quest, modeled heavily on Star Trek, believe that what they are seeing is real. Many Star Trek <b>actors</b> <b>have</b> been quoted saying that Galaxy Quest was a brilliant parody.|$|E
5|$|Actors {{begin their}} {{training}} as young children, traditionally {{at the age}} of three. Historically, Noh performers had been exclusively male, but daughters of established Noh <b>actors</b> <b>have</b> begun to perform professionally since the 1940s. In 2009, there were about 1200 male and 200 female professional Noh performers.|$|E
5|$|Although other {{recurring}} {{characters in}} the Eon series, such as M, Q and Moneypenny, had continuity within the actors, the character of Leiter has not. In the nine Eon films in which Leiter makes an appearance, there have been seven actors playing the role. Only two <b>actors</b> <b>have</b> played the part twice: David Hedison and Jeffrey Wright. Wright's first appearances also made him the first African-American actor to play the part in the Eon series, although Leiter was also played by Afro-American actor Bernie Casey {{in one of the}} non-Eon films, Never Say Never Again.|$|E
30|$|Degree {{centrality}} {{counts the}} number of ties an <b>actor</b> <b>has</b> (Wasserman and Faust 1994). Someone with high degree centrality {{may be able to}} diffuse information more broadly than someone with low degree centrality. In Fig.  1, the red middle <b>actor</b> <b>has</b> two ties while each blue <b>actor</b> <b>has</b> one tie. For this study, degree centrality is the total number of ties an <b>actor</b> <b>has.</b>|$|R

At least two West End productions have earned Olivier Awards for this role.|$|E
5|$|However, {{interviews}} with the two of the voice <b>actors</b> <b>have</b> given a glimpse into small parts of the development process. An interview with Robert Clotworthy, the voice of Jim Raynor in all released StarCraft games to date, has revealed {{that for the most}} part the voicing for the characters was done over only a few days in sessions of up to four hours, a fact mirrored in a similar interview with Sarah Kerrigan's actress, Glynnis Talken Campbell. Clotworthy also stated how the concept art for the game usually used for the visual development of characters and locales in games was used by him in order to develop the personality of his character.|$|E

5|$|Kogălniceanu is {{the subject}} of many paintings, and {{features}} prominently in Costin Petrescu's fresco at the Romanian Athenaeum (where he is shown alongside Cuza, who is handing a deed to a peasant). In 1911, Iași became host to Kogălniceanu bronze statue by Raffaello Romanelli, purported to have been recast from one of the sculptor's older works. In 1936, the Mihail Kogălniceanu Cultural Foundation commissioned Oscar Han to create a monument dedicated to Kogălniceanu, which was erected in Bucharest during the same year. <b>Actors</b> <b>have</b> portrayed Kogălniceanu in several Romanian films—most notably, Ion Niculescu in the 1912 Independența României, and George Constantin in Sergiu Nicolaescu's 1977 Războiul Independenței. During the latter stages of the Romanian Communist regime, under Nicolae Ceaușescu, Mihail Kogălniceanu's image was present in official propaganda, alongside those of other historical figures who were considered progressive.|$|E
5|$|Set in the People's Republic of China {{during the}} 1990s, the film {{centers on a}} 13-year-old {{substitute}} teacher, Wei Minzhi, in the Chinese countryside. Called in to substitute for a village teacher for one month, Wei is told not to lose any students. When {{one of the boys}} takes off in search of work in the big city, she goes looking for him. The film addresses education reform in China, the economic gap between urban and rural populations, and the prevalence of bureaucracy and authority figures in everyday life. It is filmed in a neorealist/documentary style with a troupe of non-professional actors who play characters with the same names and occupations as the <b>actors</b> <b>have</b> in real life, blurring the boundaries between drama and reality.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{regional}} theater service organization Theatre Bay Area, the San Francisco Bay Area is the third largest center of activity for theater companies and actors in the United States, after the New York City and Chicago metropolitan areas, with 400 companies spread throughout the region.

5|$|The York Mystery Plays are {{performed}} in public at intervals, using texts {{based on the}} original medieval plays of this type that were performed by the guilds – often with specific connections to {{the subject matter of}} each play. (For instance the Shipwrights' Play is the Building of Noah's Ark and the fish-sellers and mariners the Landing of Noah's Ark). The York Cycle of Mystery Plays or Pageants is the most complete in England. Originally performed from wagons at various locations around the city from the 14th century until 1570, they were revived in 1951 during the Festival of Britain, when York was one of the cities with a regional festival. They became part of the York City Festival every three years and later four years. They were mostly produced in a temporary open-air theatre within the ruins of St. Mary's Abbey, using some professional but mostly amateur actors. Lead <b>actors</b> <b>have</b> included Christopher Timothy and Robson Green (in the role of Christ) and Dame Judi Dench as a school girl, in 1951, 1954 and 1957. (She remains a Patron of the plays). The cycle was presented in the Theatre Royal in 1992 and 1996, within York Minster in 2000 and in 2002, 2006 and 2010 by Guild groups from wagons in the squares, in the Dean's Park, or at the Eye of York. They go around the streets, recreating the original productions. In 2012, the York Mystery Plays were performed between 2 and 27 August at St. Mary's Abbey in the York Museum Gardens.|$|E
