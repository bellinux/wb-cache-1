500|$|As {{was common}} with Pixar features, the {{production}} became difficult as delivery dates loomed and hours inevitably became longer. Still, Toy Story 2, with its highly compressed production schedule, was especially trying. While {{hard work and}} long hours were common to the team by that point (especially so to Lasseter), running flat-out on Toy Story 2 for month <b>after</b> <b>month</b> began to take a toll. The overwork spun out into carpal tunnel syndrome for some animators, and repetitive strain injuries for others. Catmull would later disclose that [...] "a full third of the staff" [...] ended up with some form of RSI {{by the time the}} film was finished. Pixar did not encourage long hours, and, in fact, set limits on how many hours employees could work by approving or disapproving overtime. Employees' self-imposed compulsions to excel often trumped any other constraints, and were especially common to younger employees. In one instance, an animator had forgotten to drop his child off at daycare one morning and, in a mental haze, forgot the baby {{in the back seat of}} his car in the parking lot. [...] "Although quick action by rescue workers headed off the worst, the incident became a horrible indicator that some on the crew were working too hard," [...] wrote David Price in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch.|$|E

Bernthal was to portray Shane Walsh, while Lincoln provided the role of Rick Grimes, the central character of The Walking Dead. While Hurd didn't expect to cast Lincoln, Kirkman was ecstatic with his acting, evaluating him as an [...] "amazing find". In his interview with Dread Central, Kirkman added that [...] "writing Rick Grimes month <b>after</b> <b>month</b> in the comic series, I {{had no idea he}} was an actual living, breathing human being, and yet, here he is. I couldn't be more thrilled with how this show is coming together." [...] Although he was initially shocked upon hearing of The Walking Dead, Lincoln thought the episode's script was well written. [...] "I read it and thought it was well written, and I put myself on tape just for one scene. I didn't know who was involved at this point." [...] The succeeding day, his agent called him about the development of the pilot. Lincoln described the moment as [...] "kind of like a dream list". He later communicated with Darabont via Skype; [...] "We spoke for about 40 minutes about his ideas for the project, about what I liked about Episode One and then he asked would I fly over to come and test." [...] Lincoln flew to Darabont's home, where he viewed [...] "Days Gone Bye" [...] in his garage. He opined that was [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "very intimate".|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of Opalescence PF 10 % just after treatment, at 6 -month follow-up and at a 14 -month follow-up period. Methods: Opalescence PF 10 % was applied nightly for 14 days. The color of teeth 11 and 21 of 17 subjects were measured with a spectrophotometer (L*; a*; b*) before treatment, just after treatment (14 days), <b>after</b> 6 <b>months</b> and <b>after</b> 14 <b>months.</b> Subjects were instructed to take note of any tooth sensitivity. Results: For all three components (L*, a* and b*) statistical significant differences (p < 0. 05) in the values between base-line, after treatment (14 days later), <b>after</b> 6 <b>months</b> and <b>after</b> 14 <b>months</b> were found (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Sum Test). The decrease in L* was about 20 % <b>after</b> 6 <b>months</b> and about 50 % <b>after</b> 14 <b>months.</b> The a* value decreased approximately 14 % <b>after</b> 6 <b>months</b> but was worse <b>after</b> 14 <b>months</b> than at the beginning. The b* value decreased the least with about 9 % <b>after</b> 6 <b>months</b> and about 8 % <b>after</b> 14 <b>months.</b> The decrease in View the MathML source was ∼ 20 % <b>after</b> 14 <b>months.</b> Less than 20 % of the subjects experienced mild tooth sensitivity just after treatment. Conclusion: Significantly whiter teeth were found after treatment as well as after a 6 -month follow-up period.

2500|$|G. K. Chesterton, one of Dickens's {{critics in}} the early 20th century, {{expressed}} the opinion that Mr. Boffin's pretended fall into miserliness was originally intended by Dickens to be authentic, but that Dickens ran out of time and so took refuge in the awkward pretence that Boffin had been acting. Chesterton argues that while we might believe Boffin could be corrupted, we can hardly believe he could keep up such a strenuous pretence of corruption: [...] "Such a character as his—rough, simple and lumberingly unconscious—might be more easily conceived as really sinking in self-respect and honour than as keeping up, month <b>after</b> <b>month,</b> so strained and inhuman a theatrical performance. ... It might have taken years to turn Noddy Boffin into a miser; {{but it would have}} taken centuries to turn him into an actor." [...] However, Chesterton also praised the book as being a return to Dickens's youthful optimism and creative exuberance, full of characters who [...] "have that great Dickens quality of being something which is pure farce and yet which is not superficial; an unfathomable farce—a farce that goes down to the roots of the universe." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many of the Mollies were {{miners and}} {{the mode of}} working the mines lent itself to their {{peculiar}} policy. Miners were paid by the cubic yard, by the mine car, or by the ton, and (in the driving of entries) by the lineal yard. In the assignment of places, which {{was made by the}} mining boss, there were [...] "soft" [...] jobs and hard. If a Molly applied for a soft job and was refused, his anger was aroused and not infrequently in due time the offending boss was murdered. If he got employment, there was a constant chance of disagreement in measuring-up the work and in estimating the quality of the coal mined, for it was the custom to dock the miners' wages for bad coal with too much slate and dirt, and a serious disagreement was apt to be followed by violence. Little wonder was it that, as the source of the outrages was well understood, mining bosses refused to employ Irishmen, but this did not ensure their safety, as they might then be murdered for their refusal. A good Superintendent of any colliery would, in his quality of superior officer, support an efficient mining boss and would thus fall under the ban himself. John T. Morse, Jr., who made a contemporaneous study of the Molly Maguires, wrote in his vivid account of their operations: [...] "The superintendents and 'bosses' in the collieries could all rest assured that their days would not be long in the land. Everywhere and at all times they were attacked, beaten, and shot down, by day and by night; month <b>after</b> <b>month</b> and year after year, on the public highways and in their own homes, in solitary places and in the neighborhood of crowds, these doomed men continued to fall in frightful succession beneath the hands of assassins." ...|$|E
