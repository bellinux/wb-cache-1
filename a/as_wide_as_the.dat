5|$|The nasal bones end bluntly {{close to}} the hindmost extent of the premaxillary bones. The narrow interorbital region, located between the eyes, converges towards the front and is flanked by low beads.

5|$|Midbody {{there are}} 21 dorsal scales rows (rarely 19, 20, 22, or 23). These are {{strongly}} keeled scales, {{except for those}} bordering the ventral scales. These scales seem loosely attached to the skin and lower rows become increasingly wide; those closest to the ventral scales are twice <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> ones along the midline. The ventral scales number 132-150 in males and 132–158 in females. The anal plate is single. The subcaudals are paired, numbering 32–46 in males and 23–38 in females.|$|E
5|$|Mathilde is very dark, with an albedo {{comparable}} to fresh asphalt, and {{is thought to}} share the same composition as CI1 or CM2 carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, with a surface dominated by phyllosilicate minerals. The asteroid {{has a number of}} extremely large craters, with the individual craters being named for coal fields and basins around the world. The two largest craters, Ishikari (29.3km) and Karoo (33.4km), are <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> asteroid's average radius. The impacts appear to have spalled large volumes off the asteroid, as suggested by the angular edges of the craters. No differences in brightness or colour were visible in the craters and there was no appearance of layering, so the asteroid's interior must be very homogeneous. There are indications of material movement along the downslope direction.|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} between a complex gallery grave and a passage grave (which also has smaller burial chambers opening off the main passage) is two-fold. First, the gallery grave gallery will be <b>as</b> high and <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> side burial chambers, while in a passage grave the passage is not <b>as</b> high or <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> burial chambers. Second, gallery graves are usually topped by a V-shaped tumulus, while passage graves are almost always covered by a round tumulus.|$|R

5|$|The Los Alamos Laboratory and the Army Air Forces {{had already}} {{commenced}} work on improving the design. The North American B-45 Tornado, Convair XB-46, Martin XB-48, and Boeing B-47 Stratojet bombers, {{then on the}} drawing boards, had bomb bays sized to carry the Grand Slam, which was much longer but not <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Fat Man. The only American bombers that could carry the Fat Man were the B-29 and the Convair B-36. In November 1945, the Army Air Forces asked Los Alamos for 200 Fat Man bombs. At the time {{there were only two}} sets of plutonium cores and high-explosive assemblies. The Army Air Forces wanted improvements to the design {{to make it easier to}} manufacture, assemble, handle, transport, and stockpile. The wartime Project W-47 was continued, and drop tests resumed in January 1946.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightest}} star in this constellation is Alpha Lyncis, with an apparent (visual) magnitude of 3.14. It is an orange giant of spectral type K7III located 203 ± 2 light-years distant from Earth. Around twice as massive as the Sun, it has exhausted the hydrogen {{at its core}} and has evolved away from the main sequence. The star has swollen to about 55 times the Sun's radius and is emitting roughly 673 times the luminosity of the Sun. The stellar atmosphere has cooled, giving it a surface temperature of 3,880K., see Table 1. The only star with a proper name is Alsciaukat (from the Arabic for thorn), also known as 31 Lyncis, located 380 ± 10 light-years from Earth. This star is also an evolved giant with around twice the Sun's mass that has swollen and cooled since exhausting its core hydrogen. It is anywhere from 59 to 75 times <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Sun, and 740 times as luminous. Alsciaukat is also a variable star, ranging in brightness by 0.05 magnitude over 25 to 30 days from its baseline magnitude of 4.25.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at elucidating the {{liberalization}} of Muslim world {{and its impact on}} education. For  that  purpose  the  author  traces  at  the  outset  the  origin  and  the  basic  concept  of liberalism, which  is of  postmodern Western worldview, including  the concept of  religious liberalism. The impact of  liberalism in general is <b>as</b> <b>wider</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> meaning of  liberalism in Western sense of the words. However,  this paper  confines only on  the study of  their  impact  on Muslim education with special emphasis on national education policy and on religious thought which in turn would affect curriculum development. Liberalization of religious thought appears, inter alia, through the introduction  of  the  doctrine  of  relativity  of  truth,  religious  pluralism,  gender  equality  and deconstruction  of  shari’ah  and  the  likes. All  those  religious  discourse  conceptually  hinder  the development of  curriculum and  the teaching strategy of  moral  inculcation  to the students. </p...|$|R

25|$|In the {{electron}} gun, monochromatic electrons are emitted by a cathode filament {{which is at}} a negative potential, typically 10-600 V, {{with respect to the}} sample. The electrons are accelerated and focused into a beam, typically about 0.1 to 0.5mm wide, by a series of electrodes serving as electron lenses. Some of {{the electron}}s incident on the sample surface are backscattered elastically, and diffraction can be detected if sufficient order exists on the surface. This typically requires a region of single crystal surface <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> electron beam, although sometimes polycrystalline surfaces such as highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) are sufficient.|$|E
25|$|Small was {{involved}} {{in one of the}} most controversial incidents in early cricket history when Hambledon played Chertsey at Laleham Burway on 23 & 24 September 1771. Hambledon won the match by 1 wicket. It was in this game that Chertsey's Thomas White used a bat that was <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> wicket, possibly in an attempt to force an issue about the width of the new straight bats that had recently replaced the old curved sticks. Whether that was White's intention is unclear but his action ensured that a new rule was passed which limited the width to 4.25inches. This rule supported a written motion presented by Hambledon bowler Thomas Brett that was counter-signed by club captain Richard Nyren and senior batsman Small. The original of Brett's memorandum, bearing Small's signature, is maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club in its museum at Lord's.|$|E
