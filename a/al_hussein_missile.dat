50|$|The {{largest single}} {{loss of life}} among {{coalition}} forces happened on 25 February 1991, when an Iraqi <b>Al</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>missile</b> hit a US military barrack in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 28 US Army Reservists from Pennsylvania. In all, 190 coalition troops were killed by Iraqi fire during the war, 113 of whom were American, {{out of a total}} of 358 coalition deaths. Another 44 soldiers were killed and 57 wounded by friendly fire. 145 soldiers died of exploding munitions or non-combat accidents.|$|E
5000|$|Iraq {{deployed}} its Tu-22s {{during the}} [...] "War of the Cities", flying air-raids against Tehran, Isfahan and Shiraz, with these attacks supplemented by Iraqi Scud and <b>Al</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>missiles.</b> Iran retaliated against Iraqi cities {{with its own}} Scuds. The Iraqi Air Force were particularly enthusiastic users of the gargantuan FAB-9000 (9,000 kg/20,000 lb) general-purpose bomb, which skilled Tu-22 pilots could deploy with impressive accuracy, utilizing supersonic toss bombing techniques at stand-off distances and allowing the aircraft to escape retaliatory anti-aircraft fire. Usage of the FAB-9000 was so heavy that the Iraqis ran low of imported Soviet stocks and resorted to manufacturing their own version, called the Nassir-9.|$|R
50|$|The 14th Quartermaster Detachment, is a United States Army Reserve water {{purification}} unit stationed in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. During Operation Desert Storm the Detachment lost 13 soldiers in an Iraqi <b>Al</b> <b>Hussein</b> ballistic <b>missile</b> attack on 25 February 1991 at Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. The 14th, {{which had been}} in Saudi Arabia only six days, suffered {{the greatest number of}} casualties of any allied unit during Operation Desert Storm. Eighty-one percent of the unit's 69 soldiers had been killed or wounded.|$|R
50|$|At 8:40 pm (12:40 pm EST) on 25 February 1991, {{parts of}} an Iraqi <b>Al</b> <b>Hussein</b> Scud <b>missile</b> {{destroyed}} the barracks housing {{members of the}} 14th Quartermaster Detachment. The failure of the Patriot air defense system in tracking the Scud missile over Dhahran was provoked by {{a shift in the}} range gate of the radar, due to the continuous use of the software for more than 100 hours without resetting. The radar initially detected the incoming Scud, but lost track of the Al-Hussein when the system failed to predict its new position. In the single, most devastating attack on U.S. forces during that war, 28 soldiers died and 99 were wounded. The 14th Quartermaster Detachment lost 13 soldiers and suffered 43 wounded. Casualties were evacuated to medical facilities in Saudi Arabia and Germany.|$|R
