5|$|The {{treatment}} of choice for this condition is the surgical application of epidural blood patches, which has a higher success rate than conservative treatments of bed rest and hydration. Through the injection of a person's own blood into {{the area of the}} hole in the dura, an epidural blood patch uses blood's clotting factors to clot the sites of holes. The volume of <b>autologous</b> blood and number of patch attempts for patients is highly variable. One-quarter to one-third of SCSFLS patients do not have relief of symptoms from epidural blood patching.|$|E
5|$|In {{attempts}} {{to address the}} weaker structure of the reparative fibrocartilage, new techniques {{have been designed to}} fill the defect with tissue that more closely simulates normal hyaline articular cartilage. One such technique is <b>autologous</b> chondrocyte implantation (ACI), which is useful for large, isolated femoral defects in younger people. In this surgery, chondrocytes are arthroscopically extracted from the intercondylar notch of the articular surface. The chondrocytes are grown and injected into the defect under a periosteal patch. ACI surgery has reported good to excellent results for reduced swelling, pain and locking in clinical follow-up examinations. However, some physicians have preferred to use undifferentiated pluripotential cells, such as periosteal cells and bone marrow stem cells, as opposed to chondrocytes. These too have demonstrated the ability to regenerate both the cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone.|$|E
5|$|It {{is not yet}} {{known what}} {{specific}} agent in the body brings about the allergic reaction to the radiation. When patients with SU were injected with an irradiated <b>autologous</b> serum, many developed urticaria within the area of injection. When {{people who did not}} have SU were injected, they did not demonstrate similar symptoms. This indicates that the reaction is only a characteristic of the patients with solar urticaria and that it is not phototoxic. It is possible that this photoallergen is located on the binding sites of IgE that are found on the surface of mast cells. The photoallergen is believed to begin its configuration through the absorption of radiation by a chromophore. The molecule, because of the radiation, is transformed resulting in the formation of a new photoallergen.|$|E
25|$|<b>Autologous</b> {{cells are}} {{obtained}} from the same individual to which they will be reimplanted. <b>Autologous</b> cells have the fewest problems with rejection and pathogen transmission, however in some cases might not be available. For example, in genetic disease suitable <b>autologous</b> cells are not available. Also very ill or elderly persons, as well as patients suffering from severe burns, may not have sufficient quantities of <b>autologous</b> cells to establish useful cell lines. Moreover, since this category of cells needs to be harvested from the patient, {{there are also some}} concerns related to the necessity of performing such surgical operations that might lead to donor site infection or chronic pain. <b>Autologous</b> cells also must be cultured from samples before they can be used: this takes time, so <b>autologous</b> solutions may not be very quick. Recently there has been a trend towards the use of mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow and fat. These cells can differentiate into a variety of tissue types, including bone, cartilage, fat, and nerve. A large number of cells can be easily and quickly isolated from fat, thus opening the potential for large numbers of cells to be quickly and easily obtained.|$|E

25|$|<b>Autologous</b> {{stem cell}} transplants {{have also been}} evaluated.|$|E
25|$|Stem {{cells can}} also be taken from {{umbilical}} cord blood just after birth. Of all stem cell types, <b>autologous</b> harvesting involves the least risk. By definition, <b>autologous</b> cells are obtained from one's own body, just as one may bank {{his or her own}} blood for elective surgical procedures.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} contribution {{during this period}} was {{the discovery of a}} means that allowed the administration of previously lethal doses of chemotherapy. The patient's bone marrow was first harvested, the chemotherapy administered, and the harvested marrow then returned to patient a few days later. This approach, termed <b>autologous</b> bone marrow transplantation, was initially thought to be of benefit to a wide group of patients, including those with advanced breast cancer. However, rigorous studies have failed to confirm this benefit, and <b>autologous</b> transplantation is no longer widely used for solid tumors. The proven curative benefits of high doses of chemotherapy afforded by <b>autologous</b> bone marrow rescue are limited to both Hodgkin's and selected non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients who have failed therapy with conventional combination chemotherapy. <b>Autologous</b> transplantation continues {{to be used as a}} component of therapy for a number of other hematologic malignancies.|$|E

25|$|In {{very severe}} myelosuppression, which occurs in some regimens, {{almost all the}} bone marrow stem cells (cells that produce white and red blood cells) are destroyed, meaning {{allogenic}} or <b>autologous</b> bone marrow cell transplants are necessary. (In <b>autologous</b> BMTs, cells are removed from the patient before the treatment, multiplied and then re-injected afterward; in allogenic BMTs, the source is a donor.) However, some patients still develop diseases because of this interference with bone marrow.|$|E
25|$|The {{surgical}} implantation approach effects the global augmentation {{of the breast}} hemisphere using a breast implant, either an implant filled with saline-solution, or an implant filled with silicone-gel; moreover, the surgical augmentation approach can include the application of transplanted <b>autologous</b> skin flaps harvested from the woman's body. The fat-graft transfer approach augments the size and corrects contour defects of the breast hemisphere with grafts of <b>autologous</b> adipocyte fat tissue, drawn from the woman's body.|$|E

25|$|The {{reconstruction}} of the breast(s) with grafts of <b>autologous</b> fat is a non-implant alternative to further surgery after a breast cancer surgery, be it a lumpectomy or a breast removalsimple (total) mastectomy, radical mastectomy, modified radical mastectomy, skin-sparing mastectomy, and subcutaneous (nipple-sparing) mastectomy. The breast is reconstructed by first applying external tissue expansion to the recipient-site tissues (adipose, glandular) to create a breast-tissue matrix that can be injected with <b>autologous</b> fat grafts (adipocyte tissue); the reconstructed breast has a natural form, look, and feel, and is generally sensate throughout and in the nipple-areola complex (NAC). The {{reconstruction of}} breasts with fat grafts requires a three-month treatment periodbegun after 3–5 weeks of external vacuum expansion of the recipient-site tissues. The <b>autologous</b> breast-filler fat is harvested by liposuction from the patient's body (buttocks, thighs, abdomen), is refined and then is injected (grafted) to the breast-tissue matrices (recipient sites), where the fat will thrive.|$|E
25|$|Target {{cells in}} the OA therapy are <b>autologous</b> chondrocytes, Chondroprogenitor cells, Cells within the {{synovial}} cavity, and cells of adjacent tissues such as muscle, tendons, ligaments, and meniscus.|$|E

25|$|Intraoperative blood salvage (<b>autologous)</b> or cell-saver scavenging, {{a method}} of picking up blood that has spilled from the circulatory system into an open wound, {{cleaning}} and re-infusing it.|$|E
25|$|To emplace the grafts of <b>autologous</b> fat-tissue, doctors J. Newman and J. Levin {{designed}} a lipo-injector gun with a gear-driven plunger, which allowed the even injection of <b>autologous</b> fat-tissue {{to the desired}} recipient sites. The control afforded by the lipo-injector gun assisted the plastic surgeon in controlling excessive pressure to the fat in {{the barrel of the}} syringe, thus avoiding over-filling the recipient site. The later-design lipo-injector gun featured a ratchet-gear operation that afforded the surgeon greater control in accurately emplacing grafts of <b>autologous</b> fat to the recipient site; a trigger action injected 0.1cm3 of filler. Since 1989, most non-surgical, fat-graft augmentation of the breast features the emplacement of adipocyte fat outside the breast parenchymaup to 300ml of fatin three equal measures (aliquots), is emplaced to the subpectoral space and to the intrapectoral space of the pectoralis major muscle, and the submammary space, to achieve a breast outcome of natural appearance and contour.|$|E
25|$|Jehovah's Witnesses reject transfusions {{of whole}} {{allogenic}} blood and its primary components (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and plasma), and transfusions of stored <b>autologous</b> blood or its primary components. As a doctrine, Jehovah's Witnesses do not reject transfusion of whole <b>autologous</b> blood {{so long as}} it is not stored prior to surgery (e.g. peri-operative extraction and transfusion of <b>autologous</b> blood). This religious position is due to their belief that blood is sacred and represents life in God's eyes. Jehovah's Witnesses understand scriptures such as Leviticus 17:10-14 (which speaks of not eating blood) and Acts 15:29 ("abstain from blood") to include taking blood into the body via a transfusion. Controversy has stemmed, however, from what critics state are inconsistencies in Witness policies on blood, claims that Witness patients are coerced into refusing blood and that Watch Tower literature distorts facts about transfusions and fails to provide information that would allow Witnesses to make an informed decision on the issue.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} liposuction {{technology}} facilitated medical {{applications of the}} liposuction-harvested fat tissue as <b>autologous</b> filler for injection to correct bodily defects, and for breast augmentation. Melvin Bircoll introduced the practice of contouring the breast and for correcting bodily defects with <b>autologous</b> fat grafts harvested by liposuction; and he presented the fat-injection method used for emplacing the fat grafts. In 1987 the Venezuelan plastic surgeon Eduardo Krulig emplaced fat grafts with a syringe and blunt needle (lipo-injection), and later used a disposable fat trap to facilitate the collection and to ensure the sterility of the harvested adipocyte tissue.|$|E
25|$|Surgical post-mastectomy breast {{reconstruction}} requires general anaesthesia, {{cuts the}} chest muscles, produces new scars, and requires a long post-surgical recovery for the patient. The surgical emplacement of breast implant devices (saline or silicone) introduces a foreign {{object to the}} patient's body (see capsular contracture). The TRAM flap (Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous flap) procedure reconstructs the breast using an <b>autologous</b> flap of abdominal, cutaneous, and muscle tissues. The latissimus myocutaneous flap employs skin fat and muscle harvested from the back, and a breast implant. The DIEP flap (Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforators) procedure uses an <b>autologous</b> flap of abdominal skin and fat tissue.|$|E
25|$|BCG {{has been}} {{evaluated}} {{in a number}} of studies as a therapy for colorectal cancer. The US biotech company Vaccinogen is evaluating BCG as an adjuvant to <b>autologous</b> tumour cells used as a cancer vaccine in stage II colon cancer.|$|E
25|$|Genes may be {{delivered}} to synovium in animal models of RA and OA by direct, in vivo injection of vector or by indirect, ex vivo methods involving <b>autologous</b> synovial cells, skin fibroblasts, or other cell types such as mesenchymal stem cells.|$|E
25|$|A rhinoplastic {{correction}} can {{be performed}} on {{a person who is}} under sedation, under general anaesthesia, or under local anaesthesia; initially, a local anaesthetic mixture of lidocaine and epinephrine is injected to numb the area, and temporarily reduce vascularity, thereby limiting any bleeding. Generally, the plastic surgeon first separates the nasal skin and the soft tissues from the osseo-cartilagenous nasal framework, and then corrects (reshapes) them as required, afterwards, sutures the incisions, and then applies either an external or an internal stent, and tape, to immobilize the newly reconstructed nose, and so facilitate the healing of the surgical cuts. Occasionally, the surgeon uses either an <b>autologous</b> cartilage graft or a bone graft, or both, in order to strengthen or to alter the nasal contour(s). The <b>autologous</b> grafts usually are harvested from the nasal septum, but, if it has insufficient cartilage (as can occur in a revision rhinoplasty), then either a costal cartilage graft (from the rib cage) or an auricular cartilage graft (concha from the ear) is harvested from the patient’s body. When the rhinoplasty requires a bone graft, it is harvested from either the cranium, the hips, or the rib cage; moreover, when neither type of <b>autologous</b> graft is available, a synthetic graft (nasal implant) is used to augment the nasal bridge.|$|E
25|$|The second treatment, adoptive {{transfer}} of genetically altered <b>autologous</b> lymphocytes, depends on delivering genes that encode so called T cell receptors (TCRs), into patient's lymphocytes. After that manipulation lymphocytes recognize and bind to certain molecules {{found on the}} surface of melanoma cells and kill them.|$|E
25|$|The pre-procedure mammograms were {{negative}} for malignant neoplasms. The types of anaesthesia applied were general (two patients) and epidural analgesia plus sedation, with local infiltration and intercostal nerve blocks (15 patients). The <b>autologous</b> adipocyte tissue was grafted in one-to-three stages; the average volume of a tissue-graft was 278.6cm3 {{of fat per}} operation, per breast. Post-procedure, each patient was instructed to regard any lump in the breasts as unrelated to the fat grafts, until after a complete medical workup of the breast lump had been performed. Moreover, the study Cell-assisted Lipotransfer for Cosmetic Breast Augmentation: Supportive Use of Adipose-Derived Stem/Stromal Cells (2007), about a 40-woman cohort, indicated that the inclusion of adipose stem cells to the grafts of adipocyte fat increased the rate of corrective success of the <b>autologous</b> fat-grafting procedure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Autologous</b> endometrial coculture is a {{possible}} treatment for patients who have failed previous IVF attempts or who have poor embryo quality. The patient's fertilized eggs are placed {{on top of a}} layer of cells from the patient's own uterine lining, creating a more natural environment for embryo development.|$|E
25|$|The {{outcome of}} a breast {{augmentation}} with fat-graft injections depends upon proper patient selection, preparation, and correct technique for recipient site expansion, and the harvesting, refining, and injecting of the <b>autologous</b> breast-filler fat. Technical success follows the adequate external vacuum expansion of the recipient-site tissues (matrix) before the injection of large-volume grafts (220–650cc) of <b>autologous</b> fat to the breasts. After harvesting by liposuction, the breast-filler fat was obtained by low G-force syringe centrifugation of the harvested fat to separate it, by density, from the crystalloid component. The refined breast filler then was injected to the pre-expanded recipient site; post-procedure, the patient resumed continual vacuum expansion therapy upon the injected breast, until the next fat grafting session. The mean operating room (OR) time was 2-hours, and there occurred no incidences of infection, cysts, seroma, hematoma, or tissue necrosis.|$|E
25|$|In March 2017 a {{team led}} by Masayo Takahashi {{completed}} the first successfull transplant of iPS-derived retinal cells into the eye of a patient suffering from advanced macular degeneration. The benefits of using <b>autologous</b> iPSCs are that there is theoretically no risk of rejection and that it eliminates the need to use embryonic stem cells.|$|E
25|$|A nerve {{guidance}} conduit (also {{referred to}} as an artificial nerve conduit or artificial nerve graft, {{as opposed to an}} autograft) is an artificial means of guiding axonal regrowth to facilitate nerve regeneration and is one of several clinical treatments for nerve injuries. When direct suturing of the two stumps of a severed nerve cannot be accomplished without tension, the standard clinical treatment for peripheral nerve injuries is <b>autologous</b> nerve grafting. Due to the limited availability of donor tissue and functional recovery in <b>autologous</b> nerve grafting, neural tissue engineering research has focused on the development of bioartificial nerve guidance conduits as an alternative treatment, especially for large defects. Similar techniques are also being explored for nerve repair in the spinal cord but nerve regeneration in the central nervous system poses a greater challenge because its axons do not regenerate appreciably in their native environment.|$|E
25|$|Hence does {{contemporary}} rhinoplastic praxis {{derive from}} the primeval (c. 600 BC) Indian rhinoplasty (nasal reconstruction via an <b>autologous</b> forehead-skin flap) and its technical variants: Carpue's operation, the Italian rhinoplasty (pedicle-flap reconstruction, aka the Tagliocotian rhinoplasty); and the closed-approach endonasal rhinoplasty, featuring exclusively internal incisions that allow the plastic surgeon to palpate (feel) the corrections being effected to the nose.|$|E
25|$|Perforated septum – The {{reconstruction}} of a saddle nose {{caused by a}} (collapsed) perforated septum, or by autoimmune problems such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), sarcoidosis, {{eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis}} (EGPA), relapsing polychondritis, by intranasal drug use, and by excessive nasal aerosol use. The saddle nose deformity resulting from lost dorsum support is reconstructed using <b>autologous</b> bone grafts and rib cartilage grafts.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{adjuvant}} radiation {{has significant}} potential effects {{if the patient}} has to later undergo breast reconstruction surgery. Fibrosis of chest wall skin from radiation negatively affects skin elasticity and makes tissue expansion techniques difficult. Traditionally most patients are advised to defer immediate breast reconstruction when adjuvant radiation is planned and are most often recommended surgery involving <b>autologous</b> tissue reconstruction rather than breast implants.|$|E
25|$|Patient-side <b>autologous</b> {{therapy in}} the US {{is subject to}} change. New {{guidance}} issued (FDA#218 Guidance for Industry - Cell-Based Products for Animal Use) will likely require stem cell therapy to be produced via cGMP. Resources required to implement these changes may change the US veterinary stem cell industry more towards a hub and spoke approach or towards allogeneic therapy, and away from patient-side therapy.|$|E
