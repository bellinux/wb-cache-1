5|$|Earthbags {{may be used}} to make {{dome-shaped}} or vertical wall buildings. With {{soil stabilization}} they may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> retaining walls.|$|E
5|$|In some countries, {{the need}} for more land for housing is {{threatening}} small airfields. These airfields may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> other general aviation activities, and the addition of gliding may be difficult to accommodate. This can limit the number of available airfields and so it can require longer drives to reach them.|$|E
5|$|Livestock {{for meat}} {{to be used}} as steak cuts may be raised on a farm or ranch. The meat from various wild game may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> steak cuts.|$|E

50|$|Gloucester Park has <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> Telstra Rally Australia.|$|R
5|$|Portland cement or bitumen {{may also}} be added to earth {{intended}} for construction which adds strength, although the stabilized earth is {{not as strong as}} fired clay or concrete. Mixtures of cement and lime, or pozzolana and lime, may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> stabilization.|$|E
5|$|Shamans could <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> {{personal}} purposes, as when Nurhaci's {{eldest son}} Cuyen supposedly tried to bewitch the entire Aisin Gioro lineage {{with the help}} of shamans in 1612.|$|E
5|$|The scales {{patterning}} may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> {{individual identification}} in field studies. Clipping of specific scales, {{such as the}} subcaudals, to mark individual snakes is a popular approach to population estimation by mark and recapture techniques.|$|E
25|$|Throughout its history, {{the ground}} has <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> {{a range of}} other sports, {{including}} athletics carnivals, Australian rules football, baseball, soccer, rugby league, rugby union, and international rules football. However, recent years have seen most of these activities relocated to other venues. It has <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> major rock concerts.|$|R

5|$|A diving {{cylinder}}, scuba tank or {{diving tank}} is a gas cylinder used to store and transport the high pressure breathing gas required by a scuba set. It may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> surface-supplied diving or as decompression gas or an emergency gas supply for surface supplied diving or scuba. Cylinders provide gas to the diver through the demand valve of a diving regulator or the breathing loop of a diving rebreather.|$|E
5|$|A dry bell may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> bounce dives {{to great}} depths, and then {{used as the}} {{decompression}} chamber during the ascent and later on board the support vessel. In this case {{it is not always}} necessary to transfer into a deck chamber, as the bell is quite capable of performing this function, though it would be relatively cramped, as a bell is usually as small as conveniently possible to minimize weight for deployment.|$|E
5|$|After {{the station}} was closed it was almost {{immediately}} modified. The western headwalls of both platform tunnels were rebuilt to allow a step plate junction to be installed, providing access from the eastbound and westbound tunnels to a new siding located between Down Street and Hyde Park Corner. The siding is mainly used to reverse westbound trains, but could <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> servicing trains. The siding tunnel is accessible at its western end through a small foot tunnel constructed from Hyde Park Corner station. The lifts were removed and the shafts adapted to provide additional tunnel ventilation.|$|E
25|$|Internal {{capitalization}} has <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> other technical codes like HeLa (1983).|$|R
50|$|Clustering {{algorithms}} have <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> spell checking {{combined with}} phonetic information.|$|R
50|$|Growth {{landmarks}} have <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> {{determination of}} abnormal growth as well.|$|R
5|$|Although pure oxygen pre-breathing is an {{effective}} method to protect against altitude DCS, it is logistically complicated and expensive {{for the protection of}} civil aviation flyers, either commercial or private. Therefore, it is currently used only by military flight crews and astronauts for protection during high-altitude and space operations. It is also used by flight test crews involved with certifying aircraft, and may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> high-altitude parachute jumps.|$|E
5|$|As an {{arboreal}} lizard, V. salvadorii {{can hang}} onto branches with its rear legs and occasionally use its tail as a prehensile grip. The primary {{use of the}} tail, however, is to counterbalance its weight when leaping from one branch to another. The tail may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> defense, as captive specimens have attempted to whip their keepers with their tails. This species is occasionally seen in the pet trade, but has earned a reputation of being aggressive and unpredictable. Although they are known to rest and bask in trees, they sleep {{on the ground or}} submerged in water.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is an {{antibiotic}} {{useful for the}} treatment of a number of bacterial infections. This includes middle ear infections, bone or joint infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, strep throat, pneumonia, and endocarditis among others. It can be useful against some cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> acne and in addition to quinine for malaria. It is available by mouth, intravenously, and as a cream to be applied to the skin or in the vagina.|$|E
25|$|Camphor <b>also</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> {{centuries in}} Chinese {{medicine}} {{for a variety}} of purposes.|$|R

5|$|FPGAs can be {{programmed}} with hardware description languages such as VHDL or Verilog. However, programming in these languages can be tedious. Several vendors have created C to HDL languages {{that attempt to}} emulate the syntax and semantics of the C programming language, with which most programmers are familiar. The best known C to HDL languages are Mitrion-C, Impulse C, DIME-C, and Handel-C. Specific subsets of SystemC based on C++ can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> this purpose.|$|E
5|$|Oil shale is {{used for}} cement {{production}} by Kunda Nordic Cement in Estonia, by Holcim in Germany, and by Fushun cement factory in China. Oil shale can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> production of different chemical products, construction materials, and pharmaceutical products, e.g. ammonium bituminosulfonate. However, use of oil shale for production of these products is still very rare and in experimental stages only.|$|E
5|$|Pre-moulded or {{machined}} components can be {{inserted into the}} cavity while the mould is open, allowing the material injected in the next cycle to form and solidify around them. This process is known as Insert moulding and allows single parts to contain multiple materials. This process {{is often used to}} create plastic parts with protruding metal screws, allowing them to be fastened and unfastened repeatedly. This technique can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> In-mould labelling and film lids may also be attached to moulded plastic containers.|$|E

5|$|Ruthenium and osmium {{have very}} similar {{chemistry}} {{due to the}} lanthanide contraction, but iron shows some differences from them: for example, although ruthenium and osmium form stable tetroxides in which the metal is in the +8 oxidation state, iron does not. Consequently, {{in preparation for the}} chemical characterization of hassium, researches focused on ruthenium and osmium rather than iron, as hassium was expected to also be similar to ruthenium and osmium due to the actinide contraction. Nevertheless, in the planned experiment to study hassocene (Hs(C5H5)2), ferrocene may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> comparison along with ruthenocene and osmocene.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{heating systems}} are a well known second-generation {{technology}} and generally consist of solar thermal collectors, a fluid system {{to move the}} heat from the collector to its point of usage, and a reservoir or tank for heat storage. The systems may be used to heat domestic hot water, swimming pools, or homes and businesses. The heat can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> industrial process applications or as an energy input for other uses such as cooling equipment.|$|E
5|$|Strontium {{chloride}} {{is sometimes}} used in toothpastes for sensitive teeth. One popular brand includes 10% total {{strontium chloride hexahydrate}} by weight. Small amounts {{are used in the}} refining of zinc to remove small amounts of lead impurities. The metal itself has a limited use as a getter, to remove unwanted gases in vacuums by reacting with them, although barium may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> this purpose.|$|E
