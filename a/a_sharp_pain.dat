5|$|Reactions to {{the ants}} sting show similar {{symptoms}} to fire ant stings; namely local swelling which lasts for several days, and {{swelling of the}} lips, face and eyes may occur from a minor allergic reaction. Other common symptoms include watering of the eyes and nose, and hives or welts will begin to develop. Headaches, anxiety and flushing may also occur. Jack jumpers, bees and wasps {{are the most common}} causes of anaphylaxis from insect stings. People most commonly feel <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>pain</b> after these stings, similar to that from an electric shock. Some patients develop a systemic skin reaction after being stung. Localised envenomation occurs with every sting, but severe envenoming only occurs if someone has been stung many times (as many as 50 to 300 stings in adults). The heart rate increases, and blood pressure falls rapidly. Most people will only experience mild skin irritation after being stung. Those who suffer from a severe allergic reaction will show a wide variety of symptoms. This includes difficulty breathing and talking, the tongue and throat will swell up, and coughing, chest tightness, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting may occur. Others may lose consciousness and collapse (sometimes people may not collapse), and confusion. Children who get stung will show symptoms such as floppiness and paleness if a severe allergic reaction occurs.|$|E

500|$|The pilot {{episode of}} Beyond Our Ken was well {{received}} by the BBC, and they commissioned a series to start in April 1958. On 27 February that year—his 51st birthday—Horne suffered a debilitating stroke and was totally paralysed down his left-hand side and lost the power of speech. He underwent a course of intensive physiotherapy {{and was able to}} return home after two weeks. His voice returned when, during heavy massage on his left thigh, <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>pain</b> led to him shouting [...] "You bugger!" [...] at the physiotherapist. His doctor told him that the stroke was caused by the stress of combining a full-time business post with his broadcasting work. He also told Horne that when he had recovered he would never be fit enough to continue as before. Horne considered that it was not the physical problem of combining his two careers, but the mental strain of problems in his business life; accordingly he decided to give up commerce and concentrate on a career in entertainment. Because of the stroke, plans for Beyond Our Ken were suspended.|$|E

2500|$|The {{placebo effect}} is {{believed}} to reduce pain—a phenomenon known as placebo analgesia—in two different ways. One way is by the placebo initiating the release of endorphins, which are natural pain killers produced by the brain. The other way is the placebo changing the patient's perception of pain. [...] "A person might reinterpret <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>pain</b> as uncomfortable tingling." ...|$|E

2500|$|Landis {{rode the}} 2006 Tour with the {{constant}} pain from the injury, which he described: [...] "It's bad, it's grinding, it's bone rubbing on bone. Sometimes it's <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>pain.</b> When I pedal and walk, it comes and goes, but mostly it's an ache, like an arthritis pain. It aches down my leg into my knee. The morning {{is the best}} time, it doesn't hurt too much. But when I walk it hurts, when I ride it hurts. Most {{of the time it}} doesn't keep me awake, but there are nights that it does." [...] During the Tour, Landis was medically approved to take cortisone for this injury, a medication otherwise prohibited in professional cycling for its known potential for abuse. Landis himself called his win [...] "a triumph of persistence" [...] despite the pain.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{witnesses}} {{it started}} on 17 August 1922 when Krishnamurti complained of <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>pain</b> {{at the nape}} of his neck. Over the next two days the symptoms worsened, with increasing pain and sensitivity, loss of appetite, and occasional delirious ramblings. He seemed to lapse into unconsciousness, but later recounted that he was very much aware of his surroundings, and that while in that state he had an experience of [...] "mystical union". The following day the symptoms and the experience intensified, climaxing with a sense of [...] "immense peace". Following - and apparently related to - these events [...] the condition that {{came to be known as}} the process started to affect him, in September and October that year, as a regular, almost nightly occurrence. Later the process resumed intermittently, with varying degrees of pain, physical discomfort and sensitivity, occasionally a lapse into a childlike state, and sometimes an apparent fading out of consciousness, explained as either his body giving in to pain or his mind [...] "going off".|$|E
