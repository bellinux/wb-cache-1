40|$|We first {{review the}} {{production}} and the possible chemical equilibration of strange particles at CERN-SPS energies within a microscopic hadronic transport calculation. It is shown in particular that the strange quarks are produced initially via string excitations in the primary, secondary and ternary interactions. We then further elaborate on a recent idea of <b>antihyperon</b> production by multi-mesonic reactions like n_ 1 π + n_ 2 K →Y̅+p corresponding to the inverse of the strong binary baryon-antibaryon annihilation process. It is argued that by these reactions the (rare) antihyperons are driven towards local chemical equilibrium with pions, nucleons and kaons on a timescale of 1 [...] 3 fm/c in the still moderately baryon-dense initial hadronic environment after the termination of the prehadronic string phase. Accordingly this mechanism can provide a convenient explanation for the <b>antihyperon</b> yields at CERN-SPS energies without any need of a deconfined quark gluon plasma phase.

40|$|Based on the {{experience}} from the production of anti-Lambda Lambda and anti-Sigma Sigma pairs at LEAR (experiment PS 185) it is suggested to continue the investigations towards the heavier <b>antihyperon</b> [...] hyperon pairs anti-Xi Xi and anti-Omega Omega in view of: (1) the production dynamics of the heavier <b>antihyperon</b> [...] hyperon out of the anti-p p annihilation (2) {{a comparison of the}} (3 s 3 anti-s quark system) anti-Omega Omega to the (3 (anti-s s)) 3 phi meson production, where both systems have similar masses (3. 345 and 3. 057, respectively) and identical valence quark content. A systematic study of the <b>antihyperon</b> [...] hyperon production with increasing strangeness content is interesting for the following reasons: The anti-Omega Omega production is the creation of two spin 3 / 2 objects out of the two spin 1 / 2 anti-p p particles. Results of the PS 185 experiments prove a clear dominance of the spin triplet anti-s s dissociation. In the Omega anti-Omega the three s-quarks (three anti-s quarks) are aligned to spin 3 / 2 each. If the three anti-s s pairs are now all in spin triplet configurations when created out of the gluonic interaction they should have spin parity quantum number as 3 ^- as long as Omega anti-Omega is created with relative L= 0 angular momentum. The comparison of the Omega anti-Omega baryon pair to the phi phi phi three meson production (where the three anti-s s quark pairs might not but can be produced without relative correlation) would provide a unique determination of the intermediate matter state. Measurements of excitation functions and polarization transfers should be used to examine these gluon rich anti-p p [...] > anti-Omega Omega and anti-p p [...] > phi phi phi reaction channels.
