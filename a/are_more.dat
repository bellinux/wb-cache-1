5|$|Analyses since 2001 have {{concluded}} that Eumetazoa (more complex than sponges) <b>are</b> <b>more</b> closely related to particular groups of sponges than {{to the rest of}} the sponges. Such conclusions imply that sponges are not monophyletic, because the last common ancestor of all sponges would also be a direct ancestor of the Eumetazoa, which are not sponges. A study in 2001 based on comparisons of ribosome DNA concluded that the most fundamental division within sponges was between glass sponges and the rest, and that Eumetazoa <b>are</b> <b>more</b> closely related to calcareous sponges, those with calcium carbonate spicules, than to other types of sponge. In 2007 one analysis based on comparisons of RNA and another based mainly on comparison of spicules concluded that demosponges and glass sponges <b>are</b> <b>more</b> closely related to each other than either is to calcareous sponges, which in turn <b>are</b> <b>more</b> closely related to Eumetazoa.|$|E
