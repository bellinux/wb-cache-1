5|$|Spiders are chelicerates, which {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} {{in that the}} usual body segments are fused into only two tagmata, the cephalothorax and <b>abdomen.</b> Jumping spiders have a distinctive rectangular carapace. All spiders' abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of silk glands within their <b>abdomen.</b> The cephalothorax and <b>abdomen</b> are joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel, which allows the <b>abdomen</b> to move while spinning silk. While most jumping spiders do not build webs to catch prey, they use silk for other purposes, including moulting and laying eggs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>abdomen</b> {{consists}} of ten segments, {{some of which}} may be obscured by a large pair of operculate gills, a thoracic shield (expanded part of the prothorax) or the developing wing pads. In most taxa up to seven pairs of gills arise from the top or sides of the <b>abdomen,</b> but in some species they are under the <b>abdomen,</b> and in a very few species the gills are instead located on the coxae of the legs, or the bases of the maxillae. The <b>abdomen</b> terminates in a pair of, or three, slender thread-like projections.|$|E
5|$|The <b>abdomen</b> of all mantises {{consists}} of 10 tergites, with a corresponding set of nine sternites visible in males and seven visible in females. The <b>abdomen</b> {{tends to be}} slimmer in males than females, but ends {{in a pair of}} cerci in both sexes.|$|E
50|$|These damselflies are short-winged {{and have}} very long, slender, color-banded <b>abdomens.</b> They live in dense forest habitat and rest with their <b>abdomens</b> hanging vertically.|$|R
5000|$|Mesothelae {{resemble}} the Solifugae ("wind scorpions" [...] or [...] "sun scorpions") in having segmented plates on their <b>abdomens</b> that create {{the appearance of}} the segmented <b>abdomens</b> of these other arachnids. They are both few in number and also limited in geographical range.|$|R
5000|$|Dragonflies {{may also}} raise their <b>abdomens</b> for other reasons. For instance, male Blue Dashers (Pachydiplax longipennis) assume an obelisk-like posture while {{guarding}} their territories or during conflicts with other males, displaying the blue pruinescence on their <b>abdomens</b> to best advantage. [...] However, both {{females and males}} will raise their <b>abdomens</b> at high temperature and lower them again if shaded. This behavior can be demonstrated in the laboratory by heating captive Blue Dashers with a 250 watt lamp, and {{has been shown to}} be effective in stopping or slowing the rise in their body temperature.|$|R
5|$|The {{exoskeleton}} of the <b>abdomen</b> {{is divided}} into plates called dorsal tergites and ventral sternites. Wax is secreted from glands on the <b>abdomen</b> and extruded between the sternites where it resembles flakes of dandruff. It is secreted by the queen when she starts a nest and by young workers. It is scraped from the <b>abdomen</b> by the legs, moulded until malleable and used {{in the construction of}} honeypots, to cover the eggs, to line empty cocoons for use as storage containers and sometimes to cover the exterior of the nest.|$|E
5|$|The {{thoracic}} segments {{have one}} ganglion on each side, which are connected into a pair, one pair per segment. This arrangement is also {{seen in the}} <b>abdomen</b> {{but only in the}} first eight segments. Many species of insects have reduced numbers of ganglia due to fusion or reduction. Some cockroaches have just six ganglia in the <b>abdomen,</b> whereas the wasp Vespa crabro has only two in the thorax and three in the <b>abdomen.</b> Some insects, like the house fly Musca domestica, have all the body ganglia fused into a single large thoracic ganglion.|$|E
5|$|The thorax {{has three}} {{segments}} and houses the powerful wing muscles. They have {{two pairs of}} membranous wings that may be hyaline, cloudy or pigmented. The wing venation varies between species and may help in identification. The middle thoracic segment has an operculum on the underside, which may extend posteriorly and obscure parts of the <b>abdomen.</b> The <b>abdomen</b> is segmented, with the hindermost segments housing the reproductive organs, and terminates in females with a large, saw-edged ovipositor. In males, the <b>abdomen</b> is largely hollow and used as a resonating chamber.|$|E

5|$|Adults {{are mostly}} white, but the front {{half of the}} rostrum, and {{the sides of the}} <b>abdomen,</b> are pink. Bright red bands extend across the base of the rostrum, the {{posterior}} edge of the carapace, the chelipeds, and each of the abdominal segments. The dorsal parts of the <b>abdomen</b> are brown, and there are two brown saddles on the dorsal carapace.|$|E
5|$|Coconut crabs mate {{frequently}} and quickly {{on dry land}} in the period from May to September, especially between early June and late August. Male coconut crabs have spermatophores and deposit a mass of spermatophores on the <b>abdomen</b> of the female; the <b>abdomen</b> opens {{at the base of}} the third pereiopods, and fertilisation is thought to occur on the external surface of the <b>abdomen</b> as the eggs pass through the spermatophore mass. The extrusion of eggs occurs on land in crevices or burrows near the shore. Shortly thereafter, the female lays her eggs and glues them to the underside of her <b>abdomen,</b> carrying the fertilised eggs underneath her body for a few months. At the time of hatching, the female coconut crab releases the eggs into the ocean. This usually takes place on rocky shores at dusk, especially when this coincides with high tide. The empty egg cases remain on the female's body after the larvae have been released, and the female eats the egg cases within a few days.|$|E

40|$|Identification of {{the source}} of {{mosquito}} blood meals is an important component for disease control and surveillance. Recently, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) profiling has emerged as an effective tool for mosquito blood meal identification, using the <b>abdomens</b> of freshly engorged mosquitoes. In the field, mosquito <b>abdomens</b> are crushed on Whatman filter papers to determine the host feeding patterns by identifying the origin of their blood meals. The aim {{of this study was to}} test whether crushing engorged mosquito <b>abdomens</b> on Whatman filter papers was compatible with MALDI-TOF MS for mosquito blood meal identification. Both laboratory reared and field collected mosquitoes were tested. Sixty Anopheles gambiae Giles were experimentally engorged on the blood of six distinct vertebrate hosts (human, sheep, rabbit, dog, chicken and rat). The engorged mosquito <b>abdomens</b> were crushed on Whatman filter papers for MALDI-TOF MS analysis. 150 Whatman filter papers, with mosquitoes engorged on cow and goat blood, were preserved. A total of 77 engorged mosquito <b>abdomens</b> collected in the Comoros Islands and crushed on Whatman filter papers were tested with MALDI-TOF MS. The MS profiles generated from mosquito engorged <b>abdomens</b> crushed on Whatman filter papers exhibited high reproducibility according to the original host blood. The blood meal host was correctly identified from mosquito <b>abdomens</b> crushed on Whatman filter papers by MALDI-TOF MS. The MS spectra obtained after storage were stable regardless of the room temperature and whether or not they were frozen. The MS profiles were reproducible for up to three months. For the Comoros samples, 70 / 77 quality MS spectra were obtained and matched with human blood spectra. This was confirmed by molecular tools. The results demonstrated that MALDI-TOF MS could identify mosquito blood meals from Whatman filter papers collected in the field during entomological surveys. The application of MALDI-TOF MS has proved to be rapid and successful, making it a new and efficient tool for mosquito-borne disease surveillance...|$|R

5|$|Insects have {{segmented}} bodies {{supported by}} exoskeletons, the hard outer covering made mostly of chitin. The {{segments of the}} body are organized into three distinctive but interconnected units, or tagmata: a head, a thorax and an <b>abdomen.</b> The head supports a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, and, if present, one to three simple eyes (or ocelli) and three sets of variously modified appendages that form the mouthparts. The thorax has six segmented legs—one pair each for the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax segments making up the thorax—and, none, two or four wings. The <b>abdomen</b> consists of eleven segments, though in a few species of insects, these segments may be fused together or reduced in size. The <b>abdomen</b> also contains most of the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive internal structures. Considerable variation and many adaptations in the body parts of insects occur, especially wings, legs, antenna and mouthparts.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} found that the western cicada killer wasp is capable of {{thermoregulation}} which enables them to maintain territories during the day. A study by Joseph R. Coelho showed that during territorial patrolling the species had a high and regulated thorax temperature. Experiments found that the wasp has the ability to shift heat from its thorax to its <b>abdomen</b> and that the <b>abdomen</b> is generally kept colder than the thorax. Dead wasps that were placed in the sun reached abnormally high temperatures when compared to those on nearby plants.|$|E
5|$|Like other insects, {{grasshoppers}} {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} and their body cavities are filled with haemolymph. A heart-like structure in {{the upper part of}} the <b>abdomen</b> pumps the fluid to the head from where it percolates past the tissues and organs on its way back to the <b>abdomen.</b> This system circulates nutrients throughout the body and carries metabolic wastes to be excreted into the gut. Other functions of the haemolymph include wound healing, heat transfer and the provision of hydrostatic pressure, but the circulatory system is not involved in gaseous exchange. Respiration is performed using tracheae, air-filled tubes, which open at the surfaces of the thorax and <b>abdomen</b> through pairs of valved spiracles. Larger insects may need to actively ventilate their bodies by opening some spiracles while others remain closed, using abdominal muscles to expand and contract the body and pump air through the system.|$|E

25|$|Oncomerines {{of the genera}} Cumare, Garceus, and Peltocopta {{exhibit the}} most {{advanced}} form of maternal care. Like the previously described Southeast Asian Pygoplatys individuals, the females actually carry young nymphs around on their <b>abdomens.</b> As the nymphs grow older, they eventually separate from their mothers, lose their bright colors, and become more solitary prior to molting into adults. Species which exhibit this behavior often have significantly flattened and expanded <b>abdomens.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many Asilidae have long, {{tapering}} <b>abdomens,</b> {{sometimes with}} a sword-like ovipositor. Others, for instance Laphria are fat-bodied bumblebee mimics.|$|R
5|$|Male Zygoballus sexpunctatus spiders {{are known}} to exhibit {{elaborate}} courtship displays. As a male approaches a female, it will typically raise and spread its first pair of legs and vibrate its <b>abdomen.</b> If the female is receptive, it will often vibrate its <b>abdomen</b> as well. The specific patterns of courtship behavior, however, vary between individuals.|$|E
5|$|Neuroblastoma (NB) {{is a type}} {{of cancer}} that forms in certain types of nerve tissue. It most {{frequently}} starts from one of the adrenal glands, but can also develop in the neck, chest, <b>abdomen,</b> or spine. Symptoms may include bone pain, a lump in the <b>abdomen,</b> neck, or chest, or a painless bluish lump under the skin.|$|E
5|$|The <b>abdomen</b> is {{the section}} behind the metathorax, {{made up of}} a series of rings, each with a hole for {{breathing}} and respiration, called a spiracle, composing three different segmented sclerites: the tergum, pleura, and the sternum. The tergum in almost all species is membranous, or usually soft and concealed by the wings and elytra when not in flight. The pleura are usually small or hidden in some species, with each pleuron having a single spiracle. The sternum is the most widely visible part of the <b>abdomen,</b> being a more or less sclerotized segment. The <b>abdomen</b> itself does not have any appendages, but some (for example, Mordellidae) have articulating sternal lobes.|$|E

5|$|The {{fore and}} hind wings {{are similar in}} shape, being long and narrow, with {{numerous}} cross-veins, and somewhat resembling those of primitive insects such as mayflies. A few genera, however, have reduced wings, or have lost them altogether. The <b>abdomen</b> is cylindrical with eleven segments, {{the first of which}} is fused to the metathorax. The cerci consist of one or two segments. The <b>abdomen</b> typically curves upwards in the male, superficially resembling the tail of a scorpion, the tip containing an enlarged structure called the genital bulb.|$|E
5|$|The pupae of some moths {{are able}} to wriggle their <b>abdomen.</b> The three caudal {{segments}} of the pupal <b>abdomen</b> (segments 8–10) are fixed; the other segments are movable to some degree. While the more evolved Lepidoptera can wriggle only the last two-three segments {{at the end of}} the <b>abdomen,</b> more basal taxa such as the Micropterigidae can wriggle the remaining seven segments of the abdomen; this presumably helps them to protrude the anterior end from the pupal case before eclosion. The pupae of Hepialidae {{are able to}} move back and forth in the larval tunnel by wriggling, aided by projections on the back in addition to spines. Abdominal wriggling is considered to be of startle value and discouraging to predators. In the case of a few hawk moths, such as Theretra latreillii, the wriggling of the abdomens is accompanied by a rattling or clicking sound which adds to the startle effect.|$|E
