40|$|The {{early history}} of South African {{industrial}} development has been approached from essentially two angles. One body of thought has concentrated on the adverse effect colour bars have had {{on the development of}} South Africa. It is argued that racial discrimination in industry originated from the racial prejudice of white workers and from state intervention in the economy. Opposed to that view is the interpretation that the colour bar originated out of the specific character and subsequent development of South African capitalism. This study approaches the debates and arguments through an analysis of the Wage Act of 1925. The industrial relations system which operates in South Africa has its origins in the legislation of the 1920 s. It is based on the Industrial Conciliation Act of 1924 and the Wage Act of 1925. Very few systematic analyses of the Wage Act have been produced hitherto. Most commentators have focussed on single aspects of the Act, but very few have attempted an examination of the operation of the Wage Board which was established by the Act. The Wage Board was instituted as an element to promote the civilised labour policy in the private sector. Whereas the Industrial Conciliation Act operated to protect organised labour, the Wage Act concentrated on unorganised trades and sections of trades. Although empowered to investigate conditions in the mining industry, the Wage Board was never used to regulate wages in that industry under the Wage Act due to opposition from the industry. It was concerned solely with secondary industrial and manufacturing establishments because agriculture and domestic service were excluded from the Wage Act. The Wage Act was based on the principal of compulsory regulation. Determinations in terms of the Board's recommendations were binding on employees and employers alike. Complex procedures hampered the activity of the Board until 1930 when the Act was amended and simplified. The Board faced a great deal of opposition from manufacturers in its early years. But a cautious approach and the gradual implementation of determinations ensured that employers opposition soon changed to support when it became clear the Board was not an arbitrary one. The Board had to take a number of strict considerations into account. It could not recommend wages if its recommendation would affect the particular trade concerned adversely. It concerned itself with the promotion of efficiency in business, production costs, consumerism, the wasteful employment of labour, the length of the working day and the productivity of employees. As such it was used as a means to assist the necessary rationalisation and reorganisation of South African industry. It could not recommend wages without the Minister's express instructions if all the employees covered by a reference could not receive a civilised wage. Civilised wages were classified as wages at which employees could enjoy white standards of living. This clause effectively introduced a colour bar into wage determinations. It operated before 1930 to buttress Industrial Council Agreements to prevent the displacement of whites by Africans at lower rates. The Wage Board also considered investigations from unskilled, African workers. The Board was not permitted by law to discriminate against people of colour. Apart from the potential colour bar of wage regulation in general in South Africa, the Board was instructed in 1930 to refrain from issuing recommendations for African workers. Regulations were also altered to exclude Africans. The Wage Act declined in importance after the Great Depression as white workers were drawn closer to the wider-reaching Industrial Conciliation Act. The need to regulate African wages and to control African labour became more evident during the period of economic expansion in the 1930 s. The Act was replaced in 1937 and the restrictions formerly placed on Africans were removed. The workforce had finally been separated with the provision of different industrial relations <b>appartuses.</b> " " [...] . Every industrial and commercial centre in England now possesses a working class divided into two hostile camps, English proletarians and Irish proletarians. The ordinary English worker hates the Irish worker as a competitor who lowers his standard of life. In relation to the Irish worker he feels himself a member of the ruling nation and so turns himself into a tool of the aristocrats and capitalists of his country against Ireland, thus strengthening their domination over himself. He cherishes religious, social, and national prejudices against the Irish worker. His attitude towards him is much {{the same as that of}} the 'poor whites' to the 'niggers' in the former slave states of the USA. The Irishman pays him back with interest in his own money. He sees in the English worker at once the accomplice and the stupid tool of the English rule in Ireland. This antagonism is artificially kept alive and intensified by the press, the pulpit, the comic papers, in short, by all the means at the disposal of the ruling classes. This antagonism is the secret of the impotence of the English working class, despite its organisation. It is the secret by which the capitalist class maintains its power. And that class is fully aware of it. " Marx to Siegfried Meyer and August Vogt April 9 1870 Marx and Engels Ireland and the Irish Question...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} estimating the endpoints (source and destination) of a transmission in a network based on partial measurement of the transmission path. Sensors placed at various points within the network {{provide the basis for}} endpoint estimation by indicating that a specific transmission has been intercepted at their assigned locations. During a training phase, test transmissions are made between various pairs of endpoints in the network and the sensors they activate are noted. From these possibly noisy measurements, we develop necessary constraints that any feasible network topology must satisfy. Randomized rounding of the solution to a semidefinite programming relaxation generated from the constraints is used to produce samples of network topologies defined over the feasible set. When a subset of the deployed sensors are activated, corresponding to the occurrence of a transmission with unknown endpoints, a monte carlo approximation of the posterior distribution of source/destination pairs given the activated sensors is computed by averaging over the topology samples and used in maximum a posterior estimation of the endpoints.

Hendrickson Major: Chemistry Degree: Master of Science Accurate protein {{biosynthesis}} {{is a vital}} process to all cellular life. Aminoacyl-tRNAs {{are at the heart}} of this process: A correctly formed aminoacyl-tRNA is critical for {{protein biosynthesis}}. Organisms have evolved many mechanisms to repair misacylated tRNAs before they cause errors in protein biosynthesis, thus maintaining the integrity of the genetic code. The human pathogen Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) synthesizes Glu-tRNAGln as an intermediate to producing Gln-tRNAGln. This misacylated intermediate could cause lethal errors if used by the ribosome for protein synthesis. H. pylori repairs this intermediate by the amidotransferase GatCAB. This dissertation focuses on indirect aminoacylation and transamidation to produce Gln-tRNAGln in H. pylori. A combination of phylogenetic analyses and enzymatic assays were used that contribute to a picture of this process. Chapter 2 discusses our examination of sequence conservation of gltX 2 (the gene that encodes GluRS 2) across different H. pylori strains. The conclusions of this sequencing effort are compared with trends in sequences of genes important in the aminoacylation step of protein synthesis. Chapter 3 discusses one aspect of Gln-tRNAGln production - the mechanism of transport of ammonia from the active site of one subunit (GatA) to the active site of another (GatB) through an intramolecular hydrophilic tunnel. Site-directed mutagenesis of key residues lining this tunnel and their transamidation assays were performed.

40|$|Milk protein {{responses}} to protein nutrition are typically poor and, in part, {{may be due}} to the low efficiency (∼ 25 to 30 %) of converting dietary N into milk. Posthepatic availability of amino acids (AA) is not limited, yet only ∼ 30 % is converted into milk. The poor capture of AA by the mammary gland may relate to the imbalanced and uncoordinated timing of nutrient delivery to the gland. The infusion of essen-tial AA improves the efficiency of utilization (0. 31); however, further catabolism of AA within the mam-mary gland suggests that AA transport is not a major limitation. These losses may serve ancillary or func-tional roles, but mammary oxidation of some AA oc-curs only when AA extraction exceeds the stoichio-metric requirements for milk protein synthesis. Intracellular substrate supply may be more limiting than is the <b>appartus</b> for protein synthesis. Studies utilizing isotope labeling and conducted in vitro and in vivo now suggest that circulating peptides and proteins can serve as sources of perhaps all AA for casein synthesis, but the source of these remains elusive. Constitutive protein and casein turnover con-tribute significantly (42 to 72 %) to mammary protein synthesis. All AA are extensively channeled through an intermediary protein pool or pools that have rapid turnover rates. The AA are then incorporated into casein, which appears to be fixed in association with protein turnover. The mammary gland is a major controller of its metabolism, and the mechanisms of AA extraction and conversion into milk protein are linked to secretion events. Blood flow may be a key point of regulation whereby mechanisms sense and respond to nutrient supply and balance to the gland via alterations in hemodynamics.

The specimen and inert material (alumina) are severally sealed in evacuated silica glass tubes which are able to insert chromel-alumel thermo-couples into their bottoms. The DTA curve (Fig. 12) of chalcocite shows large and small endothermic reactions at 105 ℃ and 485 ℃ which are transitions from orthorhombic to hexagonal form and from hexagonal to cubic form respectively. Cubanite (Figs. 11 and 12) is also found to transform from low temperature form to high temperature form by the DTA curve showing a distinct endothermic peak beginning at 258 ℃. The DTA curve (Fig. 12) of monoclinic pyrrhotite also represents a transition from monoclinic form to hexagonal form at 325 ℃. Both stibnite and bismuth (Fig. 13) are shown to melt congruently at temperatures of 545 ℃ and 273 ℃ respectively.

40|$|Hybrid {{power plants}} offer a {{promising}} way of producing electricity at high efficiencies. The DLR Institute of Technical Thermodynamics {{is part of}} a research partnership developing a hybrid power plant. Since the control strategy of a hybrid power plant is complex and demanding the development process is optimised by modelling components and the overall plant. The control system is developed {{on the basis of the}} power plant model. Therefore the models have to be highly reliable and fast concerning computing time. The presentation focuses on the modelling of the fuel cell system in the Hybrid Power plant project. A model library for MATLAB Simulink containing several fuel cell models as well as balance of plant components has been developed. Central part of the fuel cell system is the stack itself. A detailed model of a tubular solid oxide fuel cell was programmed including detailed electrochemistry as well as heat and mass balances. The model is validated on a Siemens SFC- 5 system. The detailled model is to complex for the integration into a real-time system simulation. Hence a system stack model was derived from the detailed model. To completely model a SOFC generator the most important parts are the balance of plant (BoP) components. Those feature ejectors for anode recirculation, reformer and desulphurisation. The ejector is modelled as a 1 D <b>appartus</b> with a 2 D velocity distribution in the premixing section. Its main purpose is to mix recirculated anode gas with fresh natural gas thus delivering steam for the reforming reaction. The reformer is modelled as a 1 D fixed bed steam reformer utilising steam reforming and water gas shift reactions. The reactions are always at equilibrium conditions. The reformer is discretised along the flow direction delivering additional information on the reactions inside the vessel. The model incorporates heat conduction between elements as well as convection of gas through the reformer. A link is integrated to exchange heat between the fuel cell and the reformer based on radiation heat transfer thus cooling the stack and supplying heat to the reformer. The presentation will focus on the modelling of the BoP components and show major influences on the performance of the BoP components as well as results from simulations of the system...|$|E
40|$|In the {{investigation}} of marine phenomena on a bay or an inshore in where water temperature, salinity and etc. are changing with the tide, an instant sampling water by reversing bottle {{may be able to}} show the only datum on one point at that instant. The datum is not always a typical value in the point. Then, many data by oftentimes sampling are needed to get the average value correctly. The authors projected the <b>appartus</b> to sample sea-water continuously for long time (12 ~ 36 hours) by means of laminar flow in a capillary. When, in Fig. 2, H (cm) is pressure head; l (cm), length of capillary; d (cm), inner diameter of the one; ν (cm^ 2 /s), kinematic viscosity of sea water; Q (cm^ 3 /s), sampled volume; thenQ≒ 25. 1 ×H･d^ 4 /(ν･l) Using d= 0. 050 ~ 0. 125 cm and l= 5 ~ 15 cm, Q (cc/s) against H (cm) is shown in Fig. 1. To sample approx. 500 cc of sea-water per day by d= 0. 05 cm, it is known from this figure that l= 5 ~ 10 cm and H= 3 ~ 7 cm must be used. Under the theoretical condideration, they examined various types of water bottle for the utility of this idea. The results of experiments with (I) -type and(III) -type (in Fig. 3) are shown in Fig. 4 and 5 respectively. It was very difficult to adjust the pressure in the bottle for a regular sampling. Because the apparatus was set up and dowm in rough sea, sea-water had been poured into the bottle through an air out-let (bubbling) pipe. Then, water sampling was dammaged by the contamination of unexpected water. On the purpose of checking the reliability of this apparatus, the calibrating test was carried on with (IV) -type (in Fig. 3) in the sea-water tank (salinity was changed artificially). The result of this test was shown in Fig. 6. The authors finished the experiment of continuous sampling with (V) -type in the tank. The last apparatus (bubbleless water bottle) can be used even in rough sea, and, in spite of the decreasing of H (cm, head), this bottle will be the most useful in the point of its reliability...|$|E
