50|$|The <b>anchor</b> <b>leg</b> is {{the final}} {{position}} in a relay race. Typically, the <b>anchor</b> <b>leg</b> of a relay {{is given to the}} fastest or most experienced competitor on a team. The athlete completing the <b>anchor</b> <b>leg</b> of a relay is responsible for making up ground on the race-leader or preserving the lead already secured by their teammates. An <b>anchor</b> <b>leg</b> is typically part of a running relay, but may also be part of swimming, skiing or skating relays.|$|R

50|$|At the Stockholm Olympics, Applegarth was {{eliminated}} {{in the semifinals}} of the 100 m competition and won a bronze medal in the 200 m. As the <b>anchoring</b> <b>leg</b> in the British 4 × 100 m relay team, he won a gold medal, in spite of finishing second after the United States in the semifinal. The United States was later disqualified for a fault in passing the baton; the same mistake {{was made in the}} final by the world record holder and main favourite German team.|$|E
50|$|At the Moscow Olympics, Prokofyev was {{fourth in}} the 110 m hurdles and {{won the gold medal}} running the <b>anchoring</b> <b>leg</b> of the Soviet 4 × 100 m relay team. At the 1982 European Championships, Prokofyev won the silver medal in the 110 m hurdles and again a gold in the 4 × 100 m relay. At the first World Championships, Prokofyev was {{eliminated}} in the heats of the 110 m hurdles, but won a bronze medal {{as a member of the}} Soviet 4 × 100 m relay team.|$|E
50|$|At the US Olympic Trials in 1972, both Hart and Rey Robinson {{repeated}} the world record, running the 100 m in 9.9 seconds, and were {{favored to win}} the race at the Olympic Games. But in Munich, they were both eliminated in the 100 m race because their coach, Stan Wright, unknowingly using an outdated Olympic schedule to determine the starting time of their quarterfinal heat, failed to deliver them to the track on time. This failure due to disorganization created much controversy. Hart also ran the <b>anchoring</b> <b>leg</b> in the American 4 × 100 m relay team, which {{won a gold medal}} and equalled the United States' own world record of 38.19.|$|E

50|$|In some cases, {{athletes who}} are not top {{performers}} in individual events excel when given the responsibility of anchoring a relay. Phil Brown, a U.K. 400 m runner, won Olympic, World and European championship medals as the <b>anchor</b> <b>leg</b> runner for his national 4 x 400 m relay team despite never having won a medal and rarely having advanced beyond the preliminary rounds individually. Although she placed 8th individually in the 100 m, Pam Marshall ran the <b>anchor</b> <b>leg</b> for the American 4 x 100 m team at the 1987 World Athletics Championships in Rome and beat Marlies Göhr in the final with an <b>anchor</b> <b>leg</b> timed at 10.11 s to Gohr's 10.41 s.|$|R

5000|$|On {{the first}} day of the World Championships, Manuel {{anchored}} the women's 4x100-meter freestyle relay to a gold medal alongside Mallory Comerford, Kelsi Worrell, and Ledecky. She split a very fast 52.14 to anchor the team to a new American record time of 3:31.72. Manuel picked up her second gold of the meet when she anchored the mixed 4x100-meter medley relay with a split of 52.17. Together with Matt Grevers, Lilly King, and Caeleb Dressel, the team broke the world record in a time of 3:38.56. Manuel's first individual event of the meet was the 100-meter freestyle, where Swedish swimmer Sarah Sjöström was widely considered the favorite to win since she had broken the world record while leading off the 4x100-meter freestyle relay on the first night of the World Championships. In similar fashion to the previous summer at the Olympics, Manuel upset the favorite by coming from behind to win the 100-meter freestyle with an American record time of 52.27, out touching Sjöström by just four-hundredths of a second. The day after, she won her fourth gold medal in the mixed 4x100-meter freestyle relay, where she split 52.18 on the <b>anchoring</b> <b>leg.</b> Alongside Comerford, Dressel, and Nathan Adrian, they set a world record of 3:19.60. On the last night of the meet, Manuel swam the finals of both the 50-meter freestyle and the women's 4x100-meter medley relay. Touching in a bronze-winning time of 23.97, she set the American record and became the first American woman to break the 24-second barrier in the 50-meter freestyle. Manuel then anchored the women's 4x100-meter medley relay to a winning time of 3:51.55. The team of Kathleen Baker, King, Worrell, and Manuel broke the 2012 world record of 3:52.05 set by Missy Franklin, Rebecca Soni, Dana Vollmer, and Allison Schmitt.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{describes}} {{results of}} a sensitivity study on an optimum mooring cost {{as a function of}} safety factor and allowable maximum offset of the offshore floating structure by finding the <b>anchor</b> <b>leg</b> component size and the declination angle. A harmony search (HS) based mooring optimization program was developed to conduct the study. This mooring optimization model was integrated with a frequency-domain global motion analysis program to assess both cost and design constraints of the mooring system. To find a trend of <b>anchor</b> <b>leg</b> system cost for the proposed sensitivity study, optimum costs after a certain number of improvisation were found and compared. For a case study a turret-moored FPSO with 3 × 3 <b>anchor</b> <b>leg</b> system was considered. To better guide search for the optimum cost, three different penalty functions were applied. The results show that the presented HS-based cost-optimum offshore mooring design tool can be used to find optimum mooring design values such as declination angle and horizontal end point separation as well as a cost-optimum mooring system in case either the allowable maximum offset or factor of safety varies. 1...|$|R
