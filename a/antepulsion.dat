Objective: To qualitatively identify the postural abnormalities which occur most frequently among children aged OBJECTIVE: Reven and ten years, comparing boys and girls, and to evaluate these subjects' lumbar flexibility. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-one children were photographed in the sagittal and frontal planes. The variables analyzed were: ankle (valgus and varus), tibiotarsal angle (opened and closed), knee (hyperextension and semiflexion, valgus and varus), pelvis (anteversion and retroversion; lateral pelvic inclination), trunk (<b>antepulsion</b> and retropulsion), lumbar spine (hyperlordosis and rectification), thoracic spine (hyperkyphosis and rectification), cervical spine (hyperlordosis and rectification), scoliosis, shoulder (imbalance and protraction), scapula (winged, abducted and adducted) and head (tilt and protraction). The lumbar flexibility was assessed using Schöber's index. RESULTS: The boys had greater incidence of winged scapula, shoulder imbalance, protraction of shoulders and head and cervical hyperlordosis than the girls did. Conversely, the girls had greater incidence of head tilt and larger Schöber index values. CONCLUSIONS: There were abnormalities in children's postural development that are probably related to muscle, skeletal and flexibility differences between the genders. These differences may influence each child's postural pattern during growth...|$|E

In this stage of development, the posture undergoes many adjustments and adaptations due to changes {{of the body and}} to demanding psychosocial factors. PURPOSE: To identify which postural alterations occur most often in students between 7 and 10 years of age, to identify preventive measures, and to provide information to parents and teachers about the problem of bad posture. METHODS: Thirty three girls in each of 4 age groups between 7 and 10 years of age were assessed, resulting in a sample of 132 subjects. Photos of each girl in the sagittal and frontal planes were examined for postural deviations. RESULTS: The main postural deviations found were knock-knee, medial rotation of the hip, <b>antepulsion,</b> pelvic anteversion, knee hyperextension, lumbar hyperlordosis, valgus ankle, imbalanced shoulders, lateral pelvic inclination, scoliosis, trunk rotation, thoracic hyperkyphosis, winged scapula, shoulder protraction, abducted scapula, medial rotation of shoulders, and head tilt. CONCLUSION: High incidences of postural alterations occur in children of school age. Some of these reflect normal postural development, and get corrected during the child's growth. On the other hand, some alterations are asymmetries that can be caused by daily demands on the body and can result in negative impacts on the quality of life during childhood and adulthood. We emphasize the importance of providing information to parents and teachers about the problem of bad posture...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe {{rotator cuff}} muscles help {{stabilize}} the glenohumeral joint. Postoperative recovery of rotator cuff muscle strength {{appears to be}} an important factor for optimal joint stabilization and the resumption of professional and/or sports activities. ObjectiveTo study the relationship between internal rotator (IR) and external rotator (ER) muscle strength, shoulder function and the resumption of sports activities (as typically evaluated with functional scores) following surgical stabilization with the Bristow-Latarjet procedure in cases of chronic shoulder instability. Patients and methodsTwenty patients with anterior, post-traumatic, chronic shoulder instability were included prospectively in a cohort study. The Rowe and Walch-Duplay functional scores were rated for the operated shoulder and the isokinetic IR and ER peak torque values were evaluated with a Con-Trex® dynamometer before surgery and then 3, 6 and 21 months afterwards. The isokinetic evaluation was performed (at 180 °/s, 120 °/s and 60 °/s) in the seated position, with the arms in 45 ° of abduction and 30 ° of <b>antepulsion</b> in the plane of the scapula. ResultsThere were no significant postoperative correlations between shoulder function (as judged by the Rowe and Walch-Duplay scores) and IR or ER muscle strength. ConclusionThis study did not provide evidence for a correlation between IR and ER muscle strength and functional scores after surgical stabilization of the shoulder. However, it is necessary to objectively measure the rotator cuff strength recovery to adequate the strengthening of rotator muscle prior to the resumption of sports activities. Isokinetic strength assessment may thus be a valuable decision support tool for the resumption of sports activities and would complement the functional scores studied here...|$|E

Con un diseño descriptivo, longitudinal, se incluyeron 40 pacientes con dolor miofascial del músculo infraespinoso atendidos en el Hospital Vicente Corral, de junio a noviembre de 2010, y se aplicó diez sesiones con la técnica de elongación con inhibición recíproca. Se midió la disminución del dolor mediante una Escala Análoga Visual (EAV) después de cada sesión y al finalizar el tratamiento. En la muestra hubo un predominio de mujeres (60 %), con un 67, 5 % entre 19 y 59 años de edad, con un 25 % de sobrepeso y obesidad según el IMC y un 67, 5 % de ocupaciones que demandan actividades manuales: amas de casa, comerciantes y empleados públicos. Evaluate the {{effectiveness}} of the technique of stretching with reciprocal inhibition for the infraspinatus muscle myofascial pain treatment. With a descriptive, longitudinal design, selected a sample of 40 patients with myofascial pain from muscle infraspinatus treated in Hospital Vicente poultry during June to November 2010 and applied ten sessions with the technique of stretching with reciprocal inhibition. It was measured pain through a Visual Análoga scale (EAV) decrease after each session and to finish the treatment. In sample was a predominance of women (60 %), with 67. 5 % aged 19 to 59, with 25 % of overweight and obesity according to the BMI and 67. 5 % of occupations that require manual activities: housewives, merchants and public employees. 47. 5 % of patients pain had at least 2 weeks duration and 52. 5 % history was longer. Right shoulder was the most affected (62. 5 %) and the most frequent location of pain in the anterior shoulder (52. 5 %). There were points trigger associated 42. 5 per cent of cases: dorsal width (17. 5 %) and pectoralis major (15 %) but only 20 % needed to desgatillamiento. <b>Antepulsión</b> shoulder had 92. 5 % of cases. After 10 sessions of the technique of stretching with reciprocal inhibition pain measured by EAV was a highly significant reduction (P = 0, 0008).

40|$|OBJETIVO: Identificar as alterações posturais em crianças praticantes de ginástica olímpica, com idade entre 8 e 12 anos. MÉTODOS: Foram avaliadas 84 estudantes, 38 praticantes de ginástica olímpica e 46 não praticantes, com idade entre 8 e 12 anos. Foram {{realizadas}} fotografias de cada criança nos planos frontal anterior e posterior e plano sagital. As fotos foram analisadas através do software Corel Draw, v. 11. 0, utilizando as ferramentas linhas-guia e dimensão (dimensão angular, dimensão vertical e dimensão horizontal), visando determinar os parâmetros das 19 variáveis qualitativas e 5 variáveis quantitativas. RESULTADOS: Ao comparar os sujeitos do grupo teste (GT) com os sujeitos do grupo controle (GC), observa-se diferença estatisticamente significante nas variáveis rotação medial de fêmur (GC 56, 52 %; GT 39, 47 %), antepulsão de pelve (GC 43, 48 %; GT 76, 32 %) e rotação de tronco (GC 67, 39 %; GT 23, 68 %). Observa-se também diferença significante em relação às medidas de valgo de joelho (GC 4, 06 ± 2, 32 cm; GT 3, 14 ± 1, 49 cm), desnível de pelve (GC 0, 69 ± 0, 39 cm; GT 0, 53 ± 0, 33 cm) e ângulo tíbio-társico (GC 86, 93 ± 2, 90 cm; GT 87, 11 ± 4, 17 cm). CONCLUSÃO: Ao analisar os resultados, nota-se uma tendência ao melhor alinhamento dos membros inferiores no grupo teste quando comparado ao grupo controle. Há um aumento da inclinação pélvica anterior e uma tendência ao aumento da hiperlordose lombar no grupo teste, fatores que podem predispor a praticante de ginástica olímpica a um desalinhamento sobre as estruturas esqueléticas, levando a quadros dolorosos, limitando a sua vida esportiva. OBJECTIVE: To {{identify the}} postural alterations among children aged 8 to 12 years who perform Olympic gymnastics. METHOD: Eighty-four students aged 8 to 12 years were assessed: 38 who were participating in Olympic gymnastics and 46 who were not. Each child was photographed in the anterior and posterior frontal planes {{and in the}} sagittal plane. The photos were analyzed using the CorelDraw v. 11. 0 software. The line-guide and dimension tools (angular, vertical and horizontal dimensions) {{were used to determine}} the parameters of the nineteen qualitative and five quantitative variables. RESULTS: Comparison between the test group subjects (TG) and control group subjects (CG) showed significant differences in the variables of medial rotation of the femur (CG 56. 52 %; TG 39. 47 %), <b>antepulsion</b> of the pelvis (CG 43. 48 %; TG 76. 32 %) and trunk rotation (CG 67. 39 %; TG 23. 68 %). There were also found significant differences in the measurements of knee valgism (CG 4. 06 ± 2. 32 cm; TG 3. 14 ± 1. 49 cm), pelvic inclination (CG 0. 69 ± 0. 39 cm; TG 0. 53 ± 0. 33 cm) and tibiotarsal angle (CG 86. 93 ± 2. 90 cm; TG 87. 11 ± 4. 17 cm). CONCLUSION: Analysis of the results showed a tendency towards better alignment of the lower limbs in the test group than in the control group. There was greater anterior pelvic inclination and a tendency towards lumbar hyperlordosis in the test group. These factors may predispose individuals participating in Olympic gymnastics to misalignment of skeletal structures, thereby leading to painful conditions that may limit their sports activities...|$|E
