5|$|Preparing for <b>a</b> <b>Fancy</b> <b>Dress</b> Ball was one {{of eight}} works {{exhibited}} by Etty at the 1835 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, the others being The Bridge of Sighs, Phaedria and Cymochles on the Idle Lake, Study from a Young Lady: A York Beauty, Study of the Head of a Youth, Venus and her Satellites, The Warrior Arming and Wood Nymphs Sleeping: Satyr Bringing Flowers. Art historian Sarah Burnage believes Etty's choice of Venus and her Satellites may have been {{to draw attention to}} similarities with Preparing for <b>a</b> <b>Fancy</b> <b>Dress</b> Ball and possibly to link the Williams-Wynn sisters' beauty with the legendary Venus.|$|E
5|$|Although Etty painted {{many private}} portraits {{of his friends}} and acquaintances, he {{produced}} very few publicly exhibited portraits, fewer than 30 of which were shown during his lifetime. Portraiture was seen as a vulgar and generally worthless form of painting throughout much of the 19th century, and portrait painters continued to be disparaged as a greedy and unimaginative group who survived by feeding the vanity of the emerging middle class. Other than Preparing for <b>a</b> <b>Fancy</b> <b>Dress</b> Ball, critics generally disliked his portraits, preferring his history paintings in spite of reservations over his depictions of nudity. Preparing for <b>a</b> <b>Fancy</b> <b>Dress</b> Ball did, however, serve as an indication that Etty could successfully paint works as commissions for the English elite, boosting his status and leading to further commissions. Etty died in November 1849 and soon fell from fashion; by the late 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. Charlotte Williams-Wynn became a noted letter writer and diarist; Mary Williams-Wynn married Member of Parliament James Milnes Gaskell. Both Charlotte and Mary died in April 1869.|$|E
5|$|The painting's {{depiction}} of preparation for <b>a</b> <b>fancy</b> <b>dress</b> party {{would have been}} familiar to Etty's generally wealthy audience. In both London and the English provincial cities, such balls and parties had become extremely fashionable by the 1830s. Though conservative in comparison to some costumes worn at contemporary fancy dress events, {{the richness of the}} design of the sisters' dress indicates the high status of the Williams-Wynn family in fashionable circles.|$|E

5|$|Enormous crowds {{could be}} {{accommodated}} at Spring Gardens, Vauxhall. In 1749 a rehearsal of Handel's Music for the Royal Fireworks attracted {{an audience of}} 12,000, and in 1786 a fancy-dress jubilee to celebrate the proprietor's long ownership was thronged with 61,000 revellers. Many {{of the best known}} musicians and singers of the day performed at the Gardens, for example Sophia Baddeley. In 1732, their fashionable status was confirmed by <b>a</b> <b>fancy</b> <b>dress</b> ball attended by Frederick, Prince of Wales. At that time access from the West End was by water, but the opening of Westminster Bridge in the 1740s made access easier though less charming.|$|E
5|$|Preparing for <b>a</b> <b>Fancy</b> <b>Dress</b> Ball was {{exhibited}} {{in a major}} retrospective of Etty's works at the Royal Society of Arts in June 1849, but after that was not exhibited publicly for 160 years. Charlotte Williams-Wynn had died childless, and the painting was inherited by the family of Mary Williams-Wynn. In 1982 it was sold to a private collector by Mary Williams-Wynn's great-granddaughter Mrs Lewis Motley. The York Art Gallery purchased the work in 2009 for £120,000 {{with the assistance of}} the Art Fund and the V/MLA Purchase Grant Fund, and it formed part of a major exhibition of Etty's work at the York Art Gallery in 2011–12.|$|E
5|$|In late 1833 Etty was {{commissioned}} by Williams-Wynn to paint a portrait of two of his seven children. Preparing for <b>a</b> <b>Fancy</b> <b>Dress</b> Ball depicts Williams-Wynn's daughters Charlotte and Mary, dressing up in lavish Italian-style costume. Although their dress is generally described as Italian, Dennis Farr's 1958 biography of Etty speculates that elements of the costumes were possibly intended to be Russian, based on Charlotte's headdress. The Italian-style clothing likely represents {{the high level of}} interest in Italian culture in early 19th-century England. The popularity of the style of music now known as bel canto, widely associated with Italy, was at its peak; likewise, the Italian plays of William Shakespeare had become extremely popular in the period. Etty, who had {{spent a good deal of}} time in Venice and other Italian cities, would have been very familiar with Italian clothing designs, and the costumes worn by the Williams-Wynn sisters closely resemble those of women in Venetian scenes painted by Etty, such as 1831's Window in Venice, During a Fiesta. As art historian Leonard Robinson points out, despite the title the sisters are not in fact shown preparing for the ball, but are fully dressed. The style of the work reflects that of Thomas Lawrence, who had been Etty's teacher in 1807–08, as well as that of Joshua Reynolds, of whom Etty was a great admirer and of whose works Etty had often made copies as an exercise.|$|E

500|$|Preparing for <b>a</b> <b>Fancy</b> <b>Dress</b> Ball, {{also known}} as The Misses Williams-Wynn, is a [...] oil on canvas by English artist William Etty, first {{exhibited}} in 1835 and currently in the York Art Gallery. Although Etty was then known almost exclusively for history paintings featuring nude figures, he was commissioned in 1833 by Welsh Conservative politician Charles Watkin Williams-Wynn to paint a portrait of two of his daughters. Preparing for <b>a</b> <b>Fancy</b> <b>Dress</b> Ball shows Williams-Wynn's daughters, Charlotte and Mary, in lavish Italian-style costume: Charlotte, the eldest, is shown standing, helping the seated Mary decorate her hair with a ribbon and a rose. Etty put {{a good deal of}} effort into the piece and took much longer than usual to finish it.|$|E
500|$|Preparing for <b>a</b> <b>Fancy</b> <b>Dress</b> Ball took Etty {{some time}} to {{complete}} in comparison to his usual work, and he apologized to the sisters for his [...] "inability to render [...] less tedious". He justified the slowness of the process by {{saying that he was}} not simply trying to capture the Williams-Wynn sisters' appearance, but [...] "to make a fine work of Art as well as a resemblance".|$|E
500|$|In mid-1833 Etty began a {{portrait}} of the daughters of Charles Watkin Williams-Wynn, the long-serving Conservative Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire, shown Preparing for <b>a</b> <b>Fancy</b> <b>Dress</b> Ball [...] Etty was then little-known for portraits, but had recently completed Elizabeth Potts, {{a portrait}} of the daughter of a family friend, which although poorly received by some critics was technically highly accomplished.

500|$|The {{painting}} was completed for and {{exhibited at the}} 1835 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition. It was generally well received, even by critics usually hostile to Etty and his work. Preparing for <b>a</b> <b>Fancy</b> <b>Dress</b> Ball demonstrated that Etty was both capable of high-quality work and deserving of patronage by the English elite, and the success led to further commissions. The painting remained {{in the collection of}} Mary Williams-Wynn's descendants, and other than an 1849 retrospective exhibition, was not shown publicly for 160 years. A private collector purchased the piece from the Williams-Wynn family in 1982, where it remained until its 2009 acquisition [...] by the York Art Gallery. It now forms part of a major collection of Etty's work there.|$|E
500|$|The {{sisters are}} {{depicted}} in three-quarter length portrait; Charlotte, the eldest, stands and helps Mary, who is seated, to decorate {{her hair with}} a ribbon and a rose. Their arrangement {{is similar to the}} positioning of the central female figures of Etty's The Lute Player, painted around the same time, and Farr views Preparing for <b>a</b> <b>Fancy</b> <b>Dress</b> Ball as a direct continuation of the theme of that work. (The Lute Player was exhibited at the British Institution in early 1835 alongside Turner's The Burning of the Houses of Lords and Commons, and was somewhat overshadowed by it. The Spectator commented that in comparison to the vibrant colours of the Turner, The Lute Player looked [...] "as if mud had been the vehicle of the pigment".) ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, City fans started a craze of {{bringing}} inflatable objects to matches, primarily oversized bananas.

Terraces packed with inflatable-waving supporters became a frequent sight in the 1988–89 season as the craze spread to other clubs (inflatable fish were seen at Grimsby Town), with the phenomenon reaching a peak at City's match at Stoke City on 26 December 1988, a match declared by fanzines as <b>a</b> <b>fancy</b> <b>dress</b> party.

500|$|Bill Russell {{was born}} to Charles Russell and Katie Russell in West Monroe, Louisiana. Like almost all {{southern}} towns and cities of that time, West Monroe was a highly segregated place, and the Russells often struggled with racism in their daily lives. Once, Russell's father was refused service {{at a gas station}} until the staff had taken care of all the white customers. When his father attempted to leave and find a different station, the attendant stuck a shotgun in his face and threatened to kill him if he didn't stay and wait his turn. At another time, Russell's mother was walking outside in <b>a</b> <b>fancy</b> <b>dress</b> when a policeman accosted her. He told her to go home and remove the dress, which he described as [...] "white woman's clothing". Because large numbers of blacks were moving to the West during World War II to look for work there, Russell's father moved the family out of Louisiana when Russell was eight years old and settled them in Oakland, California. While there the family fell into poverty, and Russell spent his childhood living in a series of public housing projects.|$|E
