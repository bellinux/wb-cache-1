25|$|At the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862, Hill was {{positioned}} near the Confederate right along a ridge; {{because of some}} swampy ground along his front, there was a 600-yard gap in Hill's front line, and the nearest brigade behind it was nearly a quarter mile away; the dense vegetation prevented the brigade commander from seeing any Union troops advancing on his position. During the battle, Maj. Gen. George Meade's division routed two of Hill's brigades {{and part of a}} third. Hill required the assistance from Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early's division to repulse the Union attack. Hill's division suffered over 2,000 casualties during the battle, which was nearly two-thirds of the casualties in Jackson's corps; two of his brigade commanders were wounded, one (Maxcy Gregg) mortally. After the battle one of his brigade commanders, Brig. Gen. James J. Archer, criticized him about the gap left in the division's front line, saying that Hill had been warned <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> the battle but had done nothing to correct it. Hill was also absent from his division, and there is no record of where he was during the battle; this led to a rumor spread through the lines that he had been captured during the initial Union assault.|$|E
500|$|Amiga reviewers had {{a common}} grouse: the {{frequent}} disk swaps required were tedious. [...] Regardless, the game's tense atmospheregenerated by {{the combination of}} game mechanics, use of sounds, and artificial intelligenceprovided memorable moments to many reviewers. [...] As one of themSimon Clays of Amiga Computingput it, Space Hulk was [...] "a very difficult strategy-cum-3D dungeon-esque title with plenty of action and gripping play." [...] May said the game offered [...] "demented" [...] violence but was [...] "irresistibly exhiliarating when the action erupts in nonstop, heartpounding carnage." [...] A decade after the game's release, several reviewers mentioned Space Hulk as a Warhammer 40,000 video game worthy of praise. [...] Meer reflected on replaying the game fifteen years after its release, [...] "The panic and terror of facing 90 degrees away from your enemy, and knowing that you can't do a damn thing <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> your lower intestine spills onto your feet, is still something pretty special." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{cinematic}} experience {{itself is}} {{the main focus of}} the film, {{but there is also a}} central theme of emptiness. Noé describes the film's subject as [...] "the sentimentality of mammals and the shimmering vacuity of the human experience." [...] The dramaturgy after Oscar has been shot is loosely based on The Tibetan Book of the Dead, and ends with the spirit's search for a way to reincarnate. The director, who opposes all religious beliefs, says that [...] "the whole movie is a dream of someone who read The Tibetan Book of the Dead, and heard <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> being [...] It's not the story of someone who dies, flies and is reincarnated, it's the story of someone who is stoned when he gets shot and who has an intonation of his own dream." [...] Noé describes the ending of the film as Oscar's recollection of [...] "the most traumatic moment of his life – his own birth". The director also leaves open the possibility that Oscar's life starts over again in an endless loop, due to the human brain's perception of time.|$|E

500|$|Caribbean Sound Basin housed three {{separate}} studios and several amenities, including a swimming pool, gym, sauna, photographic studio, and bedroom suites. In contrast to most recording studios, its interior was spacious and exposed to natural light. At the studio complex, Raphael, D'wayne, and Riley recorded extensively {{into the night}} {{and went out to}} enjoy the nightlife, before returning to the studio. They often dimmed the lights, burned incense, and drank wine to set the mood when recording, which D'wayne explained in Musician, [...] "We try to make it real calm and mellow. 'Cause {{you want to be able}} to get into what you're singing." [...] They also immersed themselves in the local dancehall scene and attended late-night block parties that lasted until dawn. D'wayne later recalled his nightlife experiences with the group in Maravel: [...] "We'd heard dancehall, but we didn't really know anything <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> going there. We would go to these block parties and you could hear them from almost a mile away. You'd just park on the street and walk to the party along with four or five thousand other people, all partying with these giant speakers all over the place. And this happened just about every weekend." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Overprotected" [...] was {{directed}} by Billie Woodruff and produced under Geneva Films, while choreographed by Brian Friedman. In an interview with Harper's Bazaar in 2011, Spears recalled the music video, saying, [...] "I just think it says a lot. It was directed so well, it was really colorful and the dancing was amazing". It begins with Spears driving away from the paparazzi, with {{a part of the}} instrumental version of the song [...] "Bombastic Love", featured on the album Britney, playing. She makes her way into an alleyway and decides to enter an abandoned factory, hoping her pursuers will be thrown off course. When she enters the building she begins to dance her way around the warehouse. Britney's dancers, having spotted her walking into the factory, follow her inside. They find Britney dancing around and joke <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> <b>before</b> heading into a heavy dance routine. Towards the end of the video, segments of Spears in a room with walls covered in pictures and articles about herself are also shown. These walls move in and out before the video ends, signifying that she is [...] "overprotected". At the end of the video, Britney walks to a wall, and exits the building.|$|E
500|$|West first {{collaborated with}} Jackson several {{months prior to}} the release of his debut album, The College Dropout (2004). West stated, [...] "I don't want to talk <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> it comes out, but it'll be unbelievable." [...] John Legend, who co-wrote the track, also plays the piano on the track. Legend was an {{upcoming}} artist and relatively unknown at the time, having not yet released his debut album Get Lifted or any singles. The song was among Legend's first major credits along with Jay-Z's [...] "Encore", West's remix of Britney Spears' [...] "Me Against the Music", and The Black Eyed Peas' [...] "The Boogie that Be." [...] Legend commented, [...] "I'm not going to focus on her breast like the rest of y'all. I'm about the music. Since everyone's paying attention to her, it should bode well for her next single [...] "Have Your Way With Me" [...] which is gonna drop next week. We're just wrapping up the production now. It's produced by Kanye West and co-written by Kanye, Harold Lilly and yours truly. I played some piano on there too. It's a sweet, soulful song. I think it'll be a smash." [...] The song also features contributions from Israeli violinist Miri Ben-Ari. Simon Umlauf of CNN commented Ari's contribution [...] "gently caresses" [...] the song, providing [...] "a dramatic edge you won't find anywhere else." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2009, Susan {{was seen}} {{offering}} {{to become a}} surrogate for her daughter Libby. Following a fight with the hospital board, Susan became pregnant. However, this causes friction with her son-in-law. Following a fall, Susan loses the baby. Woodburne called the scenes [...] "difficult" [...] to film. Alan Fletcher said the storyline [...] "could have been dreadful in the wrong hands", but he was pleased {{at the way the}} scenes were handled. He added [...] "The notion of a mother being a surrogate for their daughter is something you can't pretend is not controversial. The writers embraced that and showed how Susan's decision divided the community, and has potential to divide the family". Neighbours timeslot presented difficulties for the storyline. The writers were forced to tone the plot down to comply with guidelines. Woodburne said [...] "Because of the time of day that our show is on—it's on at 6.30 here and day time in the UK—obviously doing something as controversial as surrogacy at that time slot we would be so restricted by censorship". The storyline received mixed reactions from viewers. Woodburne said that people believe Susan is [...] "such a good mother and it's awesome she's prepared to do this for Libby and Dan". Other viewers have said that Susan should not have got involved and that the storyline was ridiculous as Susan is too old. Neighbours executive producer Susan Bower also spoke out about the storyline and said [...] "I've had quite a few letters from people in England who'd heard <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> it was even in the papers in Australia saying they disagree and think it's shocking".|$|E
