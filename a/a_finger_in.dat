5|$|In 1951, {{he had an}} 11–9 win-loss {{record with}} a career low 3.12 earned run average in 25 games. His 3.12 earned run average was good for eighth in the league. However, Bickford broke <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> 1951 after {{being hit by a}} line drive, missed most of the final three months of the season and never regained his prior form. In 1952, he was 7–12 with a 3.74 earned run average in 26 games, 22 of them starts. He played for the Braves when the team moved to Milwaukee before the 1953 season; however, he {{suffered}} from bone spurs in his pitching arm. During the 1953 season, Bickford had a 2–5 win-loss record with a 5.28 earned run average.|$|E
5|$|In {{the smaller}} painting, Mary averts {{her eyes and}} folds her hands in a gesture that symbolised {{submission}} to God's will. Mary is not submissive, however, in the larger piece. The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise. This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the Mother of God, not with resignation but with confidence. In this painting, the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{broke his}} nose at Craven Cottage on {{the opening day of}} the 1962–63 season, in a 2–1 defeat by Fulham. Leicester went to chase a {{possible}} double, reaching the FA Cup semi-finals whilst lying top of the table in April. City beat Liverpool 1–0 at Hillsborough to reach the final, with Banks keeping a clean sheet despite his goal being under a near-constant siege from the Merseyside club. The News of the World reported that Liverpool had had 34 attempts on goal to Leicester's one, and Banks later stated that it was his finest performance at club level. Unluckily, Banks then broke <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> a 2–1 defeat by West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns, and was out injured as Leicester lost their final three league games, ending the season in a disappointing fourth place. In the 1963 FA Cup Final Banks {{and the rest of the}} team underperformed, and lost the game 3–1 to Manchester United.|$|E

5|$|Ingham was capped {{once for}} Northern Ireland at under-18 level, making his only {{appearance}} in a 2–1 home defeat to the Republic of Ireland on 9 March 1999 in 1999 UEFA European Under-18 Championship qualifying. After being understudy to David Miskelly for two under-21 matches in 2000, Ingham made his debut in a 2–0 home defeat to the Czech Republic on 23 March 2001 in 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifying. Having made his last under-21 appearance in a 4–0 defeat to the Czech Republic on 5 June 2001 in another qualifier, his international career {{at this level}} concluded with four caps. Ingham was called into the senior Northern Ireland squad in August 2002 after Roy Carroll was released. He was called into the Northern Ireland B squad in May 2003, but was forced to withdraw because of injury. Ingham's form during a loan at Wrexham saw him placed on standby for Northern Ireland's match with Serbia and Montenegro in April 2004. He was named in the Northern Ireland squad for their tour of the Caribbean in May 2004, but dislocated <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> training in June, which meant he missed out on making his debut.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes Venus only grazes the Sun {{during a}} transit. In {{this case it}} is {{possible}} that in some areas of the Earth a full transit can be seen while in other regions there is only a partial transit (no second or third contact). The last transit of this type was on 6 December 1631, and the next such transit will occur on 13 December 2611. It is also possible that a transit of Venus can be seen {{in some parts of the}} world as a partial transit, while in others Venus misses the Sun. Such a transit last occurred on 19 November 541 BC, and the next transit of this type will occur on 14 December 2854. These effects occur due to parallax, since the size of the Earth affords different points of view with slightly different lines of sight to Venus and the Sun. It can be demonstrated by closing an eye and holding <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> front of a smaller more distant object; when you open the other eye and close the first, the finger will no longer be in front of the object.|$|E
5|$|While {{travelling}} {{on a train}} Abbe {{noticed an}} older man staring at him who then {{asked if he was}} a 5th Dan Judo.

So who are you?“ Kenshiro replied: “Everyone knows who I am, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Judo champion of all Japan! “ Yes, I can see that,“ the old man replied. The old man continued to talk to Kenshiro much to his annoyance as he wanted to get some sleep. Eventually, the old man put <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> Kenshiro’s face, “You are so powerful, break my finger!” Kenshiro was only too happy to oblige. He took the finger, expecting to snap it like a twig, and wham! He found himself on the carriage floor under the full control of the old man. The old man allowed Kenshiro to get back into his seat. “Who are you?” Kenshiro Abbe asked. “I am Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido.” Kenshiro Abbe was astounded at the technique of the old man and requested that he become his student.|$|E

Soon after, Geraint Jones, who had remained first choice for England despite a slump in batting form, broke <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> the second Test match against Pakistan in 2006; the next day Read scored a rapid 72 against Northamptonshire in a Natwest Pro 40 League game.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{was also}} an {{important}} member of the successful Yorkshire team which dominated the County Championship in the 1960s, winning seven titles between 1959 and 1968. Often an opening batsman, he {{was also an}} occasional bowler, taking 131 first-class wickets in his career. He {{was a member of the}} Yorkshire team that won the final of the third Gillette Cup, in 1965. Taylor made his first appearance for Yorkshire in 1953, aged 17, won his county cap at 21 and played for England at 23, opening the batting against India with Arthur Milton. He was dropped after two matches, but was selected again in 1964, after an epic innings of 160 at Sheffield against the visiting Australians. Unfortunately he broke <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> that match, and was not selected for his country again. After a benefit, he retired from professional cricket in 1968.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Finger {{forces are}} known to change involun-tarily during {{multi-finger}} force-production tasks, even when <b>a</b> <b>finger’s</b> involvement <b>in</b> <b>a</b> task is not consciously changed (the enslaving effect). Furthermore, during maximal force-production (MVC) tests, the force pro-duced by <b>a</b> given <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> multi-finger task is smaller than the force generated by this <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> its single-finger MVC test (the force-deficit effect). A set of hypothetical control variables – modes – is introduced. Modes can be estimated based on individual finger forces during single-finger MVC tests. We show that a simple formal model based on modes with only one free parameter accounts for <b>finger</b> forces during <b>a</b> variety of multi-finger MVC tests. The free parameter accounts for the force-deficit effect, and its value depends only on the numbe...|$|R

25|$|He played {{regularly}} for Western Province in 1946-47 {{and in the}} match against Transvaal he hit 52 while opening the batting; {{this was to be}} his only first-class score of more than 50. On the strength of that and four catches in the Transvaal second innings, he was picked for the 1947 South African tour of England. With Johnny Lindsay and George Fullerton also in the touring side, Ovenstone's opportunities were limited. Lindsay was chosen for the first three Test matches and though his poor batting meant that he then lost his Test place, Ovenstone was not available, as he was sidelined for two months after breaking <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> a county game immediately after the second Test; {{by the time he was}} fit again, the tour was almost over and Fullerton had taken over as the Test wicketkeeper.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> forked <b>fingering</b> is <b>a</b> <b>fingering</b> <b>in</b> which <b>an</b> {{open hole}} has covered holes below it: fingerings {{for which the}} {{uncovering}} of the holes is not sequential. For example, the fingering 0123 is not <b>a</b> forked <b>fingering,</b> while 0123 56 is <b>a</b> forked <b>fingering</b> because the open hole 4 has holes covered below it - holes 5 and 6. Forked fingerings allow for smaller adjustments in pitch than the sequential uncovering of holes alone would allow. For example, at the same air speed the fingering 0123 5 sounds higher than 01234 but lower than 0123. Many standard recorder fingerings are forked fingerings.
