50|$|Glass {{and metal}} can bond {{together}} by purely mechanical means, which usually gives weaker joints, or by chemical interaction, where the oxide layer {{on the metal}} surface forms a strong bond with the glass. The acid-base reactions are main causes of interaction between glass-metal {{in the presence of}} metal oxides on the surface of metal. <b>After</b> <b>complete</b> <b>dissolution</b> of the surface oxides into the glass, further progress of interaction depends on the oxygen activity at the interface. The oxygen activity can be increased by diffusion of molecular oxygen through some defects like cracks. Also, reduction of the thermodynamically less stable components in the glass (and releasing the oxygen ions) can increase the oxygen activity at the interface. In other words, the redox reactions are main causes of interaction between glass-metal in the absence of metal oxides on the surface of metal.|$|E

Here we show that nanoscale grooves can control the nucleation of epitaxial Ge islands on Si(001), and can drive lateral motion of existing islands onto the grooves, even when the grooves are very narrow and shallow compared to the islands. A position centered on the groove minimizes energy. We use as prototype grooves the trenches which form naturally around islands. During coarsening, the shrinking islands move laterally to sit directly astride that trench.

The calculations indicated that the solid phases in particle with ammonium-to-sulfate ratio between 1. 5 ? 2, were ammonium sulfate and letovicite.

The equilibrium model yielded a satisfactory prediction of the hygroscopic growth of particles generated from a solution with 1 : 1 mass ratio between dissolved ammonium sulfate and ammonium bisulfate. However, for particles with 3 : 1 and 10 : 1 mass ratios, the model predictions overestimated the growth at relative humidities between about 60 % and the point of complete deliquescence (close to 80 % RH).

Material and Methods Nickel targets were prepared and processed as previously reported [1]. Briefly, the bath solution was composed of a mixture of natural NiCl 2. 6 H 2 O (135 mg/ml) and H 3 BO 3 (15 mg/ml) and Ni was electrodeposited using a gold disk as cathode and a platinum wire as anode. The plating process was carried out at room temperature using 2 ml of bath solution (pH = 3. 7) and a constant current density of 60 mA/cm 2 for 1 hour. The unirradiated Ni targets were dissolved in 1 – 2 ml of concentrated (10 M) HCl at 90 oC. <b>After</b> <b>complete</b> <b>dissolution</b> of the Ni layer, water was added to dilute the acid to 6 M, and the solution was transferred onto a chromatographic column containing AG 1 -X 8 resin equilibrated with 6 M HCl. The Ni, Co and Cu isotopes were separated by using the well-known chromatography of the chloro-complexes. The sample-fractions containing the Cu isotopes (15 ml, 0. 1 M HCl) were collected in plastic centrifuge tubes previously soaked in 1 M HNO 3 and rinsed with Milli-Q water (18 MΩ cm). Impurities of B, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn in these samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) at the Department of Geosciences (Laboratory of Isotopic Studies) of the National University. Results and Conclusions The mass of Ni deposited in 1 h was 25. 0 ± 1. 0 mg (n = 3) and the current efficiency was > 75 % in all cases. The pH of the electrolytic solution tended to decrease along the electrodeposition process (3. 7  1. 6). The results of ICP-MS analysis of the Cu-fractions from the cold chromatography separation runs are shown in FIG. 1. We were {{particularly interested in the}} boron impurities as H 3 BO 3 is used as buffer for electrodeposition of the Ni targets. Except for the Ni impurities that were deter-mined to be in the range of ppm (mg/l), all other analyzed metallic impurities were found to be in the range of ppb (µg/l), including boron. The Co, Ni, Cu and Zn impurities determined in the Cu-fraction in this work using Ni targets electrode-posited from a NiCl 2 acidic solution, are in the same order of magnitude compared with that obtained when using targets prepared from an alkaline solution [2], with the advantage of the simplicity of the electrodeposition method from NiCl 2 solutions, as the target material is already recovered in the chemical form of NiCl 2, enabling a simpler, one step process to prepare a new plating solution when using enriched 64 Ni target material for the production of 64 Cu...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the great}} {{challenges}} {{in the twenty-first century}} is unquestionably energy storage. In response to the needs of modern society and emerging ecological concerns, it is now essential to search for new, low-cost, and environmentally friendly energy conversion and storage systems. The performance of these devices depends intimately on the properties of their materials. Nanostructured materials have attracted great interest in recent years because of the unusual mechanical, electrical and optical properties with which such materials are endowed by their specific structures. In this work, materials with unique nanostructured morphologies were prepared, which include germanium, cobalt oxide, manganese oxide, nickel oxide, and tin-antimony alloy. Carbon sources such as amorphous carbon with added graphene were also introduced into the materials to form composites. The as prepared materials have been characterized in terms of their physical properties and energy storage performance. Mesoporous and hollow germanium@carbon nanostructures were synthesized through simultaneous carbon coating and reduction of a hollow ellipsoidal GeO 2 precursor. The formation mechanism of GeO 2 ellipsoids and the ratio of Ge 4 + to Sn 4 + in the starting materials were also investigated. Specifically, in a basic solution, the hydrolysis of Ge 4 + and Sn 4 + can occur simultaneously to generate insoluble GeO 2 and Sn(OH) 4 white precipitates. In order to minimise the free energy, the small nanoparticles gradually self-assemble to form large ellipsoids. Simultaneously, gradual dissolution of the Sn(OH) 4 templates also takes place due to the basic etching under continuous ultrasonication. When the reaction time reaches 120 min, GeO 2 hollow ellipsoidal structures with well-defined interiors and compact shells are eventually formed <b>after</b> <b>complete</b> <b>dissolution</b> of the Sn(OH) 4. Sn(OH) 4 was selected as the template because it has good material compatibility with GeO 2 and can slowly dissolve in a basic solution under continuous ultrasonication, while the GeO 2 precipitate can only dissolve in strong basic or acidic solutions; therefore, in principle, the hollow structure can be generated as a result of simultaneous etching of the Sn(OH) 4 template. The volume of the hollow interior can also be adjusted by the reaction time under ultrasonication and the ratio of GeCl 4 to SnCl 4 in the starting materials. In order to gain more insight into the effects of the ratio of GeCl 4 to SnCl 4 as starting materials on the hollow ellipsoid morphology, a series of ratio-dependent experiments (Ge 4 + : Sn 4 + = 1 : 1, 1 : 0. 5, and 1 : 0, with the resultant samples denoted as GeO 2 - 1,GeO 2 - 2, and GeO 2 - 3, respectively) were conducted. Compared to the solid ellipsoidal Ge@carbon (Ge@C- 3) sample, the hollow ellipsoidal Ge@C- 1 sample exhibits better cycling stability (100 % capacity retention (1285 mAh/g) after 200 cycles at the 0. 2 C rate) and higher rate capability (805 mAh/g at 20 C) compared to Ge@C- 3 due to its unique hollow structure; therefore, this hollow ellipsoidal Ge@carbon can be considered as a potential anode material for lithium ion batteries. A novel hierarchical star-like form of Co 3 O 4 was successfully synthesized from self-assembled hierarchical Co(OH) F precursor via a facile hydrothermal method and subsequent annealing in air. The as-prepared hierarchical Co 3 O 4 material displays novel star-like microstructures with a diameter of around 11 m along every diagonal axis, which are made up of bundled porous nanoneedles. The morphological evolution process of the Co(OH) F precursor was investigated by examining the different reaction times during synthesis. Firstly, hexagonal plates are formed, and then nanodiscs grow {{on the surface of the}} plates. Subsequently, dissolution and regrowth of the Co(OH) F occurs to form the star-like hierarchical structures. The Co 3 O 4 obtained from thermal decomposition of the Co(OH) F precursor in air at 350 oC exhibited high reversible capacity as anode material in lithium ion batteries. The specific charge capacity of 1036 mAh/g was obtained in the first cycle at the current density of 50 mA/g, and after 100 cycles, the capacity retention was nearly 100 %. When the current density was increased to 500 mA/g and 2 A/g, the capacities were 995 and 641 mAh/g, respectively, after 100 cycles. In addition, a capacity of 460 mAh/g was recorded at current density of 10 A/g in the rate capability test. The excellent electrochemical performance of the Co 3 O 4 electrodes can be attributed to the porous interconnected hierarchical nanostructures, which protect the small particles from agglomeration and buffer the volume change during the discharge/charge processes. A nanocomposite of Mn 3 O 4 wrapped in graphene sheets was successfully synthesized via a facile, effective, energy-saving, and scalable microwave hydrothermal technique. The reduction of graphene oxide (GO) and the loading of Mn 3 O 4 nanoparticles on the graphene sheets occurred simultaneously, which can avoid the introduction of additional molecular cross-linkers to bridge the nanoparticles and the graphene matrix. The morphology and microstructures of the fabricated reduced GO (rGO) -Mn 3 O 4 nanocomposite were characterized using various techniques. The nanocomposite was then tested in lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors. The results indicate that the particle size of the Mn 3 O 4 particles in the nanocomposite markedly decreased to nearly 20 nm, significantly smaller than for the bare Mn 3 O 4. Electrochemical measurements demonstrated, in terms of lithium energy storage, a high specific capacity of more than 900 mAh/g at 40 mA/g, and excellent cycling stability with no capacity decay could be observed up to 50 cycles. For the supercapacitors, the capacitance value of the rGO(31. 6 %) -Mn 3 O 4 nanocomposite reached 153 F/g, much higher than that of the bare Mn 3 O 4 (87 F/g) at a scan rate of 5 mV/s in the potential range from - 0. 1 V to 0. 8 V. A 200 % increase in capacitance was observed for the nanocomposite with cycling at 10 mV/s due to electrochemical activation and the oxidization of Mn(II,III) to Mn(IV) during cycling, as verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. There was no observable capacitance fading up to 1000 cycles. All of these properties are also interpreted by experimental studies and theoretical calculations. The facile synthesis method and good electrochemical properties indicate that the nanocomposite could be an electrode candidate for energy storage. Nanocuboid shaped nickel oxide was synthesized using an optical floating zone furnace. It was found that the nanocuboids exhibit a single crystalline nature and have clean and sharp edges. Furthermore, the nickel oxide nanocuboids were tested for their electrochemical performance as anode material for lithium-ion batteries in coin-type half-cells. The effects of fluoroethylene carbonate additive on the lithium storage performance were also investigated, which is the first such study for transition metal oxides. It was found that fluoroethylene carbonate has a positive effect on the cycling stability and also improves the rate performance of the nanocuboids. The capacity recorded at 0. 1 C (100 mA g- 1) after 50 charge/discharge cycles is 1400 mAh g- 1. The nickel oxide nanocuboids could also achieve a very high rate capability of 12 C (12 A g- 1) with capacity of 312 mAh g- 1. SnSb-core/carbon-shell nanotubes directly anchored on graphene sheets (GS) were synthesized by the hydrothermal technique and chemical vapour deposition (CVD). The simultaneous carbon coating and the encapsulation of SnSb alloy is effective for alleviating the volume-change problem both in lithium ion batteries and in sodium ion batteries. After optimizing the electrolyte for SnSb in the sodium ion batteries, the optimized coaxial SnSb/carbon nanotube/GS (SnSb/CNT@GS) nanostructures demonstrated stable cycling capability and rate performance in 1 M NaClO 4 with propylene carbonate (PC) + 5 % fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). The SnSb/CNT@GS electrode can retain the capacity of 360 mAh/g for up to 100 cycles, which is 71 % of the theoretical capacity. This is higher than in the other three electrolytes tested, and higher than that of the sample without the addition of graphene. The good electrochemical performance can be attributed to the efficient buffer provided by the outer carbon nanotube layer and the graphene protection from the agglomeration of SnSb particles, as well as its high conductivity...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} cola treatment for gastric phytobezoars, including diospyrobezoars. METHODS: A total of 17 patients (range: 48 to 78 years) with symptomatic gastric phytobezoars treated with cola and adjuvant endoscopic therapy were reviewed. Three liters of cola lavage (10 cases) or drink (7 cases) were initially used, and then endoscopic fragmentation was done for the remnant bezoars by using a lithotripsy basket or a polypectomy snare. The overall success of dissolving a gastric phytobezoars with using three liters of cola and the clinical and endoscopic findings were compared retrospectively between four cases of <b>complete</b> <b>dissolution</b> by using only cola and 13 cases of partial dissolution with cola. RESULTS: After 3 L of cola lavage or drinking, a <b>complete</b> <b>dissolution</b> of bezoars was achieved in four patients (23. 5 %), while 13 cases (76. 5 %) were only partially dissolved. Phytobezoars (4 of 6 cases) were observed more frequently than diospyrobezoars (0 of 11) in the group that underwent <b>complete</b> <b>dissolution</b> (P = 0. 006). Gender, symptom duration, size of bezoar and method of cola administration {{were not significantly different}} between the two groups. Twelve of 13 patients with residual bezoars were completely treated with a combination of cola and endoscopic fragmentation. CONCLUSION: The rate of <b>complete</b> <b>dissolution</b> with three liters of cola was 23. 5 %, but no case of diospyrobezoar was completely dissolved using this method. However, pretreatment with cola may be helpful and facilitate endoscopic fragmentation of gastric phytobezoars...|$|R
