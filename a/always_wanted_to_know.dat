5|$|When Woody Allen {{offered him}} a role in one segment of Everything You <b>Always</b> <b>Wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask), Wilder accepted, hoping {{this would be the}} hit {{to put an end to}} his series of flops.

25|$|The {{clinical}} study Human Sexual Response {{was published by}} Masters and Johnson in 1966, and the topic suddenly became more commonplace in America. The 1969 book Everything You <b>Always</b> <b>Wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask) by psychiatrist David Reuben was a more popular attempt at answering the public's curiosity regarding such matters. Then in 1972 appeared The Joy of Sex by Alex Comfort, reflecting an even more candid perception of love-making. By this time, the recreational or 'fun' aspects of sexual behavior were being discussed more openly than ever before, and this more 'enlightened' outlook resulted {{not just from the}} publication of such new books as these, but from a more pervasive sexual revolution that had already been well underway for some time.|$|E
25|$|Feena is {{the princess}} of the Kingdom of Sphere {{on the moon and}} also the main female protagonist. In order to become more {{knowledgeable}} about Earth and be able to follow in her mother's footsteps, she comes to Earth in a homestay with the family of the primary secretary {{to the president of the}} United Nations, Sayaka Hozumi. Since she was very young, she has <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> more about the Earth and some day she hopes to surpass her mother in trying to bridge the gap between the Earth and the Kingdom of Sphere. She is well educated in terms of literature and science and has great sword skills. However, she is somewhat naive in matters of the heart and has a tendency to jump into situations without thinking, (such as jumping into a river to save a drowning puppy, without knowing how to swim, and mistaking moths for aliens). Feena once came to Earth when she was a child, and met Tatsuya previously after her mother's death, in which Tatsuya tried to comfort her. She eventually falls in love with him and later marries him to finally bring peace between the Earth and the Moon.|$|E

500|$|... “Captain Pissgums and His Pervert Pirates” by S. Clay Wilson in Zap Comix #3 (1968) {{featured}} explicit sexual {{homosexual acts}} and {{was instrumental in}} making other underground cartoonists approach taboo subjects. However, gay characters rarely featured in underground comics from 1968 to 1975, {{and when they did}} they were usually lisping caricatures and comic transvestites. An installment of [...] "Harold Hedd" [...] by Rand Holmes in 1971 stands out for attacking the homophobia of David Reuben’s sex manual Everything You <b>Always</b> <b>Wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask), featuring explicit mutual gay sex acts, and promoting gay liberation.|$|E
500|$|Robert Sandall {{gave the}} book a {{positive}} review in The Sunday Times, and wrote: [...] "What makes this book worthwhile is its fiercely illuminating angle. ... Morrison, as usual, declined {{to take part}} but the author's scholarly methods lend this weighty volume a real authority." [...] The Journal Gazette called the book: [...] "A definitive, provocative and revelatory portrait of an endlessly complicated man and his music." [...] A review in The Irish Times characterised the book as a [...] "magical" [...] journey into Van Morrison's life, noting: [...] "Johnny Rogan spent 23 years researching his biography of Van Morrison. It shows. In a book that really should have been titled Everything You <b>Always</b> <b>Wanted</b> <b>To</b> <b>Know</b> About Van Morrison But Were Too Petrified To Ask, this is a magical 'into the mystic' journey which vertiginously takes you from Edward Carson to Leadbelly, from the Mafia to the Rosacrucians, from drinking stories to Gestalt therapy, and from Bernadette Devlin to Terry Keane." [...] Brian Boyd of The Irish Times described Rogan's work as a [...] "superb book".|$|E

The singer was dressed in nude colored seashell and rhinestone bra and underwear, with her hair coiffed high, and wearing a septum piercing. Gaga also sang the track on the Japanese variety show SMAP×SMAP on November 28, 2013. [...] "Venus" [...] was included on the setlist for the [...] tour in 2014. She performed it wearing a mop-top wig and clam-shell bikini, while playing a Gibson Flying V guitar. During the performance, 15 large, inflatable flowers rose up from below on stage. The flowers were inflated using an air hose to create a garden on the stage. According to Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone, [...] "Gaga did 'Venus' in a clamshell bikini and a wig evoking Raquel Welch in One Million Years B.C., while her dancers wore sad little white costumes that made them look like Woody Allen and Christopher Guest playing sperm cells in Everything You <b>Always</b> <b>Wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)." [...] In 2017, Gaga performed the song at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.|$|E

500|$|After Everything You <b>Always</b> <b>Wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask), Wilder {{began working}} on a script he called Young Frankenstein. After he wrote a two-page scenario, he called Mel Brooks, who {{told him that it}} seemed like a [...] "cute" [...] idea, but showed little interest. A few months later, Wilder {{received}} a call from his agent, Mike Medavoy, who asked if he had anything where he could include Peter Boyle and Marty Feldman, his two new clients. Having just seen Feldman on television, Wilder was inspired to write a scene that takes place at Transylvania Station, where Igor and Frederick meet for the first time. The scene was later included in the film almost verbatim. Medavoy liked the idea and called Brooks, asking him to direct. Brooks was not convinced, but having spent four years working on two box-office failures, he decided to accept. While working on the Young Frankenstein script, Wilder was offered the part of the Fox in the musical film adaptation of Saint Exupéry's classic book, The Little Prince. When filming was about to begin in London, Wilder received an urgent call from [...] Brooks, who was filming Blazing Saddles, offering Wilder the role of the [...] "Waco Kid" [...] after Dan Dailey dropped out at the last minute, while Gig Young became too ill to continue. Wilder shot his scenes for Blazing Saddles and immediately afterwards filmed The Little Prince.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was during}} {{the run of the}} {{syndicated}} version that Woody Allen parodied What's My Line? in his 1972 film Everything You <b>Always</b> <b>Wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> About Sex, with the segment [...] "What Are Sex Perverts?" [...] featuring a game show called What's My Perversion? Appearing as panelists were Robert Q. Lewis, who had been a panelist on the original What's My Line?, and Pamela Mason, who had been a mystery guest. Jack Barry, partner of Dan Enright, both of whom had taken falls in the quiz-show scandals of the 1950s, hosted the What's My Perversion? game show, years before both would finally return to television in triumph with The Joker's Wild.|$|E

You’re a minister’s daughter so you grew up with this stuff, but you’re also a feminist.' A lot of this music was written when things were really puritanical and women didn’t have any rights, and so there isn’t a lot of embracing of the feminine except with the Virgin Mary, if that makes any sense. Because he and I were talking about music that goes back, a more pagan style of music where {{there seems to be a}} place where goddesses were honoured if you go back into antiquity. And he said, 'I’d really like to see you have a perspective on the carols and write some of your own.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, Wilson amassed myriad home demo {{recordings}} which later became informally {{known as the}} [...] "Bedroom Tapes". Most of these recordings remain unreleased and unheard by the public. Some of the material {{has been described as}} [...] "schizophrenia on tape," [...] and [...] "intensely personal songs of gentle humanism and strange experimentation, which reflected on his then-fragile emotional state." [...] Beach Boys archivist Alan Boyd observed: [...] "A lot of the music that Brian was creating during this period was full of syncopated exercises and counterpoints piled on top of jittery eighth-note clusters and loping shuffle grooves. You get hints of it earlier in things like the tags to 'California Girls,' 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' and all throughout Smile, but it takes on an almost manic edge in the '70s." [...] Brian's daughter Wendy remembers, [...] "Where other people might take a run to release some stress, he would go to the piano and write a 5-minute song." [...] Her sister Carnie has recounted: [...] "My memories of him are him wandering from room to room... thinking about something. I <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what he was thinking, you know? Who knows what he was thinking in his head? ... We got used to what the whole environment was.
