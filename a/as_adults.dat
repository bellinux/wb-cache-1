5|$|Cicadas were {{eaten in}} Ancient Greece, and are {{consumed}} today in China, both <b>as</b> <b>adults</b> and (more often) as nymphs, in Malaysia, Burma, Latin America, and central Africa.

5|$|Like all ants, banded sugar ants begin life as eggs. If the egg is fertilised, the ant {{becomes a}} female; if not, {{it will become}} a male. They develop through {{complete}} metamorphosis, meaning that they pass through a larval and pupal stage before emerging <b>as</b> <b>adults.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like other ants, Myrmecia ants {{begin as}} an egg. If the egg is fertilised, the ant becomes a diploid female; if not, {{it becomes a}} haploid male.

5|$|Many solitary wasps are parasitoids. <b>As</b> <b>adults,</b> {{those that}} do feed {{typically}} only take nectar from flowers. Parasitoid wasps are extremely diverse in habits, many laying their eggs in inert stages of their host (egg or pupa), sometimes paralysing their prey by injecting it with venom through their ovipositor. They then insert one or more eggs into the host or deposit them upon {{the outside of the}} host. The host remains alive until the parasitoid larvae pupate or emerge <b>as</b> <b>adults.</b>|$|E
5|$|Research done by McCarthy and Taylor (1999), {{found that}} {{children}} with abusive childhood experiences {{were more likely to}} develop ambivalent attachments.

5|$|The {{broad bean}} weevil, B. rufimanus is univoltine. It reproduces in spring in faba bean crops, lays eggs {{on the young}} pods, {{develops}} in the growing seeds and overwinters <b>as</b> <b>adults</b> in shelters, or in diapause as larva or pupa diapause in the stored seeds.|$|E

5|$|Children {{are less}} likely than adults to clear the infection. More than 95% of people who become {{infected}} <b>as</b> <b>adults</b> or older children will stage a full recovery and develop protective immunity to the virus. However, this drops to 30% for younger children, and only 5% of newborns that acquire the infection from their mother at birth will clear the infection. This population has a 40% lifetime risk of death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Of those infected between the age of one to six, 70% will clear the infection.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that aposematism and mimicry is less evident in marine invertebrates than terrestrial insects because predation is a more intense selective force for many insects, which also disperse <b>as</b> <b>adults</b> rather than as larvae and have much shorter generation times. Further, {{there is evidence that}} fish predators such as blueheads may adapt to visual cues more rapidly than do birds, making aposematism less effective.|$|E
5|$|Males {{begin to}} {{increase}} in size {{at a faster rate}} with each successive moult after the seventh instar. Females, on the other hand, produce their first brood at the seventh instar. They may moult several times <b>as</b> <b>adults,</b> becoming sexually receptive each time until death. The average lifespan of C.mutica in laboratory conditions is 68.8 days for males and 82 days for females.|$|E
5|$|Many writers {{compare their}} {{perceptions}} of To Kill a Mockingbird <b>as</b> <b>adults</b> with when they first read it as children.

5|$|Octopuses {{are highly}} intelligent, but {{the extent of}} their {{intelligence}} and learning capability are not well defined. Maze and problem-solving experiments have shown evidence of a memory system that can store both short- and long-term memory. It is not known precisely what contribution learning makes to adult octopus behaviour. Young octopuses learn nothing from their parents, <b>as</b> <b>adults</b> provide no parental care beyond tending to their eggs until the young octopuses hatch.|$|E
5|$|Parents of {{children}} with ASD {{have higher levels of}} stress. Siblings {{of children}} with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings {{of children with}} Down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship. However, they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships <b>as</b> <b>adults.</b>|$|E
