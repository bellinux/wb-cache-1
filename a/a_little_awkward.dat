500|$|Andre Dellamorte of Collider called Item 47 [...] "silly". William Bibbiani of Crave Online said, [...] "The short {{is largely}} a success: [...] Hernandez, [...] Bradford and [...] Caplan are all in fine form although, [...] Welliver seems saddled with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>awkward</b> dialogue, {{particularly}} in regards to Coulson, which doesn’t entirely sell." [...] Spencer Terry of Superhero Hype! said, [...] " [...] is easily the best one they've done, and I think that {{can be attributed to}} its length seeing as it's three times longer than the other One-Shots. With a longer run time, the short film doesn't have to rush to show us everything that it wants to - we get a clear understanding of both the S.H.I.E.L.D. perspective of the events and the robbers' point of view." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 19, 2012, Aguilera and Shelton {{performed}} [...] "Just a Fool" [...] for {{the first}} time on the third season of The Voice, an American television singing competition on which she is serviced as a coach. Wearing [...] "sharp in dark", [...] "semi-casual" [...] outfits, the couple sang the first verse at opposite sides of the stage, and then came together onstage and shared the second one. During the performance, Aguilera kept belting to a minimum. The duo ended their singing with a hug. Caila Ball from Idolator wrote, [...] "Clumsy cross-promotions and hyperbole aside, it was a night of stellar performances, kicked off by Coaches Christina and Blake making the world debut of 'Just a Fool'". She continued to praise the performance, commenting, [...] "It was a refreshingly stripped down performance from Legendtina – who uncharacteristically took the stage in jeans. Blake, on the other hand, looked <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>awkward</b> up there without a guitar and a stool".|$|E
500|$|Shill and cinematographer Ken Seng were {{inspired}} by Roman Polanski and Alfred Hitchcock when constructing the set, and attempted {{to make it look}} both frightening and suburban. Shill stated, [...] "It didn't look like typical Hollywood; it didn't look cosmetic." [...] The Charles' family home was set in a 1923 Altadena, California house, however the action scenes were shot on a separate purpose-built set. The set was customized from a house built for The Stepfather (2009), which in turn was adapted from a block of apartments for Quarantine (2008). The Charles' living room had a ceiling [...] high, and a custom-built chandelier for the climactic ending of the film. According to Gainor, the house is symbolic of the family's aspirations, and is intentionally too large for the three occupants; he said, [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>awkward</b> and a little bit eerie." [...] The fight scene was filmed on a sound stage set, rather than in the house, for safety and practicability reasons.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Grint {{starred in}} his first non-Harry Potter film, Thunderpants, which {{revolves}} around Patrick (played by Bruce Cook) whose remarkable capacity for flatulence scores him {{a job as an}} astronaut. In this film, Grint portrayed the co-lead role of Alan, an [...] boy who is Patrick's only friend. It was generally ignored by critics and audiences alike. Most of the critics that did take notice of Thunderpants did not respond well to it, with one writing: [...] "This film should be shown in prisons so that inmates have a good reason to never return." [...] Another film he appeared in was Driving Lessons, a comedy-drama released in 2006, where he starred opposite Julie Walters. The film was met with a mixed reception by critics, but his portrayal of an oppressed teenaged boy was generally praised. [...] "Grint, on the other hand, is a revelation", who [...] "displays an innate naturalness mixed with personal charisma that turn a potentially pathetic Christian freak into a humorous, thoroughly likable – if more than <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>awkward</b> – young man", wrote Alt Film Guides Andre Soares.|$|E
500|$|Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu {{commented that}} [...] "though {{the first half}} of the movie is well-paced, the second half sags with the songs and twists forced into the plot to buy time", but stated that it was [...] "passable with its slick production, a few funny lines, glam {{quotient}} and star appeal." [...] Subhash K. Jha criticised the film's [...] "dishy digressions" [...] and [...] "peripheral sub-plots", rating it 2 out of 5 overall, but was impressed with the court scene, which he considered [...] "splendid". He also found Chopra's performance to be a triumph, remarking: [...] "A star is born! As the predatory social-climbing seductress who can go to any length to satiate her lust for life, Priyanka Chopra rocks the scene like never before." [...] Jha believed that Kareena was miscast and seemed <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>awkward</b> in a non-glamorous role, but [...] "comes into her own in the climactic courtroom sequence", a sentiment echoed by Jitesh Pillai in his review for The Times of India. Pillai gave a rating of 3 out of 5 and noted that [...] "it isn't drama that directors were striving for, yet the film works." ...|$|E
500|$|The New Directions set {{of three}} Jackson family numbers was favorably {{reviewed}} by most critics, though they didn't necessarily agree on which songs were most effective. Bell couldn't decide whether she enjoyed these three songs or the Troubletones mash-up more, and West felt the [...] "choreography on {{the whole thing was}} stellar", and graded it an [...] "A+". Votta singled out [...] "ABC", which demonstrated [...] "what a lovely singer Tina is", and Kubicek said he enjoyed it [...] "mostly because Tina deserves more singing time, and I love the fact that Mike is now an actual singer who gets his own solos". Chaney called it [...] "a solid performance" [...] and gave it a B+, while Futterman wrote that it [...] "felt like a flashback to the New Directions' group performances of yesteryear, when it was all about an over-the-top, feel-good attitude". The dancing in [...] "Control" [...] was highlighted in many reviews: Hyman and Slezak were complimentary, but Chaney wrote that the [...] "choreography seemed <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>awkward</b> and occasionally out of synch", that it was [...] "the least effective of the three Jackson numbers" [...] and added that for her [...] "this felt dated when it could have been retro-fresh"; she graded the song a [...] "C". However, Futterman made mention of the [...] "slick dance moves", and Votta noted that the [...] "jazz band guys" [...] were [...] "holding their own with the background dancing through the whole number". However, for Kubicek, the song [...] "definitely brought down the energy at the middle of their performance". Bell characterized the final song as [...] "an amazing 'Man in the Mirror' cover", and Chaney said it was [...] "the best of their three songs", and gave it an [...] "A−". However, Slezak wrote that it [...] "proved to be a tonally jarring ending to the performance".|$|E

500|$|To mix the tracks, a Sony Oxford Console was used. Audio {{engineer}} Mick Guzauski {{explained to}} SoundByte {{that he used}} the console's [...] "Automated EQ feature" [...] on the tracks. He {{said that he could}} [...] "tailor the frequency responses and dynamics within each song with optimum equalizer at every pitch and level." [...] For the Afanasieff tracks, the background vocals and overdubs were accomplished on the Oxford console at his Wally World StudioB, at San Rafael, California. Simpson's label-mate and Latin singer Marc Anthony is featured as a guest vocalist on the ballad [...] "There You Were". Simpson met Anthony at the taping of the TV special A Christmas in Washington in 2000. They talked to each other, and proposed recording a song on both of their next albums. They sang the song {{side by side in the}} studio and the whole song was completed within six hours. [...] "Forever in Your Eyes" [...] was one of the first songs to be recorded for the album, and was produced by Rhett Lawrence. It was recorded at Sony Music Studios within two hours. Rodney Jerkins, who was acquainted with Mottola, produced two cuts on Irresistible. In an interview with Sony Music Japan, Simpson said that she never met Jerkins in person. He produced and recorded the songs' music and sent the tape to Columbia, from which [...] "Imagination" [...] and [...] "I Never" [...] were selected. Cory Rooney produced Simpson's vocals and Tony Maserati mixed the vocals. Initially, Simpson did not want to record [...] "What's It Gonna Be" [...] as she felt the line [...] "Are you gonna be a dog or a gentleman" [...] was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>awkward.</b> However, due to her record label's persuasion, she recorded the song and ultimately became fond of it. In order to record the title track, Simpson traveled to Murlyn Music Studios, in Sweden. [...] "A Little Bit" [...] was produced by Ric Wake; although he produced many songs for the album, only [...] "A Little Bit" [...] made the final cut. The Japanese version of the album contains a bonus track—the Hex Hector remix of [...] "Irresistible"—for which Simpson re-recorded her vocals.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{audition}} process {{consisted of}} two readings for the producers, before Ryan was asked {{to come in to}} talk through the part with the executive producers, Jeri Taylor, Rick Berman and Brannon Braga. Following this, she tested for the network and was told that her option had been picked up. She remarked of her experience of joining the team on Voyager, [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>awkward</b> since the cast had been together for three years already. And one of the original characters was being written out pretty much at the same time I was being added. But the cast was terrific, and very welcoming." [...] Although she wore extensive make-up for her first appearances, including an eye-piece that fell off when she smiled, her typical make-up regime took around 45 minutes, with the attachment of the Borg appliance above her eye taking an additional 15 minutes. Her hairstyling usually took as long as that combined.|$|E
2500|$|After {{growing up}} in Stamford, Connecticut, she {{attended}} Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, for her senior year {{and was a member}} of the school's first co-educational class, which included jazz composer Bill Cunliffe, software executive Peter Currie, artist Julian Hatton, poet Karl Kirchwey, writer Nate Lee, editor Sara Nelson, restaurateur Priscilla Martel and sculptor Gar Waterman. [...] "Andover was the best time of my life," [...] she recalled. She played the lead role of Nellie Forbush in the school's spring musical production of South Pacific opposite Peter Kapetan as Emile. She commented: [...] "It was just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>awkward</b> to be Nellie at first because she hesitates to marry Emile since he had once lived with a Polynesian woman – I don't agree with her reasoning so that made things a bit hard at the beginning." [...] She appeared in a student video directed by classmate Jonathan Meath in a film class taught by Steve Marx. She graduated in 1974 with the academic honor of [...] "cum laude" [...] which was awarded to 80 out of 378 graduating seniors. She majored in theater at Wesleyan University, worked in summer stock productions during vacations, and graduated in 1978. Later, in an interview, she reported that she sometimes had eating disorders during this time of her life. She said: [...] "I binged... I starved ... I was one step from anorexia [...] a piece of toast and an apple would be all I would eat in a day." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dr Phelps {{cleared his}} throat, {{and looked at}} his watch.

I try to make myself clear to you. So extremes can meet; at least I hope so." [...] He gave me <b>a</b> charming <b>little</b> <b>awkward</b> bow.

5000|$|The release {{prompted}} some hostility {{from members}} of Bush's inner circle: Bush's wife, Laura Bush, said in an interview, [...] "I don't know if I'd use the word 'betrayed,' but I think it's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>awkward</b> for sure"; while Bush evangelical ally James Dobson said he was [...] "shocked by Wead's breach of trust". Bush himself did not comment. The tapes' release also provoked negative reaction from some commentators, such as Bill Press, who called Wead [...] "scum", and Bill O'Reilly, who called Wead [...] "the lowest form of debris in the country." ...|$|R

This time she was chosen to perform in the show's twelfth cycle. It was during her time on the show that she learned she was cross-eyed, a fact she was not aware of until judge and photographer Nigel Barker pointed it out.|$|R
