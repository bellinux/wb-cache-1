25|$|Born in Bucharest, Topîrceanu {{began his}} {{schooling}} in the city, {{and then moved}} to the hilly countryside of the <b>Argeş</b> <b>county,</b> in the Șuici commune, where he formed his taste for themes taken from nature. After completing secondary studies, he attended the University of Bucharest Law School, and then its Faculty of Letters, without ever finishing either. This was largely due to a hectic lifestyle punctuated by numerous affairs and heavy alcohol use.|$|E
25|$|After the war's {{end and the}} {{establishment}} of Greater Romania, Aderca returned to Craiova, where his wife Sanda Movilă (herself an aspiring writer, born Maria Ionescu in <b>Argeș</b> <b>County)</b> gave birth to their son Marcel in January 1920. Later that year, the family settled in Bucharest, where Aderca was appointed to a civil service office within the Ministry of Labor (an office he kept until 1940). He was collaborating with another poet, Benjamin Fondane, preparing lectures on various literary subjects to compliment Fondane's projects for the stage.|$|E

Currently, the {{territory}} that comprised Făgăraș County is now mostly included in the Brașov County, while its western part belongs now to Sibiu County. In the interwar period, the county neighbored Târnava-Mare County to the north, Brașov County to the east, Muscel and <b>Argeș</b> <b>counties</b> to the south, and Sibiu County to the west.|$|R
50|$|The socio-political {{formation}} of the Dacians Buri / Buridavensi that was centered on Buridava was located to the North East of Oltenia and Muntenia (modern Vâlcea and <b>Argeş</b> <b>counties)</b> and also {{on the other side}} of the Carpathians, in the regions of Sebeş and Făgăraş mountains. This tribal union is documented by the archaeological monetary findings Aninoasa Dobresti. Among other evidences, a fragment of a vase carrying the inscription BUR, discovered at Ocnita, Muntenia, Romania, indicates the name of the tribe or union of tribes, the Buridavensi Dacians.|$|R

Lupu. He was the PNŢ local leader for <b>Argeş</b> <b>County,</b> and, when the party came to power with the Iuliu Maniu cabinet in 1928, served as prefect of Argeş before being appointed general secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture by Mihalache (who was titular Minister). In 1930, he was appointed Under Secretary of State in the Alexandru Vaida-Voevod-led Ministry of the Interior.|$|E
25|$|Having {{passed his}} law {{examination}} in 1904, Urmuz was first appointed {{judge in the}} rural locality of Cocu (Răchițele), in <b>Argeș</b> <b>County.</b> It is probable that at around this stage (ca. 1908), he was committing to paper the first fragments in his collection Bizarre Pages, {{some of which were}} reportedly written during a family reunion in Cocu. According to Eliza Vorvoreanu, he was doing this mainly to entertain his mother and sisters, but Urmuz also amused local potentates, one of whom even offered his daughter's hand in marriage (Urmuz refused). At the time, Mitică also discovered his passion for modern art: he was an admirer of primitivist sculptor Constantin Brâncuși, fascinated by his 1907 work The Wisdom of the Earth.|$|E
25|$|The Antonescus were ktitors {{of three}} Romanian Orthodox churches in {{separate}} Bucharest areas: Mărgeanului Church in Rahova, one in Dămăroaia, and the Saints Constantine and Helena Church in Muncii, {{where they are}} depicted in a mural. In 1941, after floods took a toll on <b>Argeș</b> <b>County,</b> the two founded Antonești, a model village in Corbeni (partly built by Ukrainian prisoners of war, and later passed into state property). Although her picture was a regular presence {{on the front pages}} of newspapers and magazines, Maria Antonescu was nevertheless perceived by some of her contemporaries as a withdrawn and secondary figure. Accounts of her life were provided by various public figures, including Princess Ileana (who met her shortly before leaving the country in 1947) and anti-communist members of the Romanian diaspora. Some mentions of her were made in Bénie sois-tu, prison ("Bless You, Prison"), a best-selling book of memoirs by Nicole Valéry Grossu, a former Mislea inmate and defector to France.|$|E

25|$|Born in Cofa village, {{northern}} Bessarabia (presently Konovka, Ukraine), he was {{the eldest}} son of Eftimie Baconsky, a Romanian Orthodox priest, whose name he used as his patronymic middle name (usually marked by the initial). His brother Leon was born in 1928, around {{the time when the}} Baconsky family was spending long intervals in Drepcăuţi, a locality on the Prut River shore. In 1936–1944, he was in Chişinău, where he attended the Alecu Russo Gymnasium and High School, publishing his first poems in the school magazine Mugurel during 1942. During those years, Romania was engaged on the Axis side in the war against the Soviet Union, and Bessarabia soon became part of the Eastern Front, before the King Michael Coup and the start of Soviet occupation brought Nazi German influence to an end (see Romania during World War II). The Baconskys left the region, and Anatol attended the Lahovary High School in Râmnicu Vâlcea (1944–1945). Eventually, the family settled in Ciomăgeşti, <b>Argeş</b> <b>County,</b> while Anatol took his baccalaureate (June 1945) and briefly worked at a factory in the Transylvanian town of Cisnădie.|$|E
2500|$|Born at Florica, his father's {{estate in}} Ștefănești, <b>Argeș</b> <b>County,</b> he {{completed}} his secondary {{education at the}} Saint Sava National College in Bucharest (1882). [...] He then volunteered for the Romanian Army's artillery, serving for six months before becoming a Second lieutenant. During his military service, Brătianu studied engineering. He left for Paris in 1883, and attended the Collège Sainte-Barbe, then took classes (without being a registered student) at the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées (1884–1889). Brătianu received an engineer's diploma, but not a licence to practice.|$|E
2500|$|On 1418 February 1761, at Alba Iulia, Sofronie {{organized}} {{a meeting of}} the Transylvanian Orthodox Synod, which demanded total freedom of worship in Transylvania. [...] The Austrian authorities sent the General Adolf von Buccow to pacify the region and arrest Sofronie, who, just before being arrested, managed to escape to Wallachia, where he had many sympathizers. Sofronie remained in Wallachia until his death. He continued to dedicate his life to Orthodox monasticism, as a monk at the monasteries of Robaia (1764–1766), Vieroşi (1766–1771) and then Curtea de Argeş, all in the <b>Argeş</b> <b>County.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Born in Câmpulung-Muscel, <b>Argeş</b> <b>County,</b> {{he was the}} son of Constantin Barbilian and Smaranda, born Şoiculescu. He {{attended}} the Ion Brătianu High School in Piteşti and the Gheorghe Lazăr High School in Bucharest. During that time, he discovered that he had a talent for mathematics, and started publishing in Gazeta Matematică, one of the most prestigious math publications of that time; [...] it was also then that he discovered his passion for poetry. Ion Barbu was known as [...] "one of the greatest Romanian poets of the twentieth century and perhaps the greatest of all" [...] according to Romanian literary critic Alexandru Ciorănescu. As a poet, he is best known for his volume Joc secund ("Mirrored Play").|$|E
2500|$|After the Romanian {{authorities}} {{returned to}} Bucharest, Sion's work {{was featured in}} the Franklin Hall salon organized by Minerva Publishers (1919). He still flirted with socialism, and, as noted by journalist Tudor Teodorescu-Braniște, helped out in the 1920 funeral ceremony of Marxist theorist Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea: [...] "The great old man [...] was being laid down on a bier {{that a group of}} socialist painters, headed by Teodorescu Sion, had previously wrapped in red fabric." [...] His wartime conduct and artistic merits resulted in formal recognition, and he was granted high honors—the Order of the Crown (as Officer) and Bene Merenti Medal, both in 1923. The same year, he participated in the Arta Română exhibit with <b>Argeș</b> <b>County</b> landscapes, including Fântâna lui Manole ("Manole's Fountain").|$|E
2500|$|Re-adapting {{himself to}} what critic Tudor Vianu calls [...] "the mountaineer's experience", Sion was {{resuming}} his travels {{deep into the}} mountains, in both <b>Argeș</b> <b>County</b> and areas of Transylvania. Of all the paintings he presented for the public during the Ileana Gallery Art Show in 1925, the vast majority were landscapes of the mountains, or compositions with shepherds and mountain-folk such as La isvorul Troiței ("At the Troița [...] Spring"), alternating with new Balcic seascapes. There is the occasional still life: Roz și roș ("Pink and Red"), which probably alluded to a poem by Transylvanian author Octavian Goga, impressed Goga and was bought for the state by Ion Lapedatu. Sion returned to the same venue in early 1926, when his exhibited a diverse selection of his newer compositions, and was rewarded with a higher class Order of the Crown.|$|E
2500|$|Little {{is known}} about Radu Paisie's origins and early life, {{although}} it is often assumed that he was baptized as [...] "Petru" [...] and had a strong connection with <b>Argeș</b> <b>County,</b> in Muntenia. According to some reports, {{he was married to}} a Lady Stana. It is also known that he had a sister, Cârstina. One account is that he was born into boyardom, and that, following his wife's death, he had taken orders at Argeș Monastery. Scholar Valentin Gheonea proposes that Petru was forced into monastic seclusion by Prince Vlad Vintilă de la Slatina, after an early attempt to seize the throne. Written tradition maintains that, while at Argeș, he was known as Hegumen Paisie. A document issued by Michael the Brave implies that Paisie was also a fishmonger, calling him Radu vodă Măjescul—"Radu Voivode of the Maja", from an obsolete measure of weight for fish.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after his}} return from Paris, Cioculescu {{established}} himself as a presence on the literary scene, and began frequenting the informal and bohemian literary club formed around Casa Capşa restaurant. One of his earliest polemics was carried with his colleague Perpessicius by means of Adevărul journal: Cioculescu found his adversary's aesthetic relativism and rejection of [...] "sectarianism" [...] to be incompatible with the mission of critic. Between 1928 and 1929, Cioculescu and Streinu were on the staff of Kalende, a literary magazine published in Piteşti, <b>Argeş</b> <b>County.</b> After a short interval during which he worked as a schoolteacher in Găeşti town (where he was notably a contributor to the short-lived modernist review Cristalul), Cioculescu entered the civil service, becoming an inspector of Romanian schools. This was the alleged start of a documented lifelong rivalry between Cioculescu and literary historian George Călinescu: the inspector reportedly chose to intervene during an Italian-language class Călinescu was giving to high school students, and managed instead to infuriate him.|$|E
2500|$|Ceaușescu {{frequently}} {{accompanied her}} husband on official visits abroad. During a state visit to the People's Republic of China in June 1971, she took note of how Jiang Qing, Chairman Mao Zedong's wife, maintained a position of real power. Most likely inspired by this, she began to engineer her own political rise in Romania. In July 1971, she was elected {{a member of the}} Central Commission on Socio-Economic Forecasting, and in July 1972, she became a full member of the Romanian Communist Party Central Committee. In June 1973, after having been nominated by Emil Bodnăraș, she was elected to the party's Executive Committee. In November 1974, at the 11th Party Congress, she was made a member of the (renamed) political executive committee, and in January 1977, she {{became a member of the}} highest party body, the Permanent Bureau of the Political Executive Committee. In March 1975, she was elected to the Grand National Assembly, the country's national legislature, holding the seat for Pitești, <b>Arges</b> <b>County,</b> the most important industrial region of the country, until her death in 1989. [...] In March 1980, she was made a First Deputy Prime Minister, a state title she also held until she was executed in the Romanian Revolution.|$|E
2500|$|Beyond their {{propaganda}} and censorship efforts, Antonescu and his regime had a sizable impact on Romanian culture, art and literature. Owing to austere guidelines on culture {{and to the}} circumstances of wartime, this period's direct imprint is {{less than that of}} other periods in the country's history. Few large heroes' memorials were built during the war years. Memorials produced at the time were mainly roadside triptychs (troițe). The Heroes' Cult organization received expropriation rights to Bucharest's Jewish cemetery in 1942, and proposed to replace it with a major monument of this category, but that plan was eventually abandoned. Antonescu and his wife preferred donating to Orthodox churches, and were ktitors of churches in three separate Bucharest areas: Mărgeanului Church in Rahova, one in Dămăroaia, and the Saints Constantine and Helena Church in Muncii, where both the Marshal and his wife are depicted in a mural. After floods took a toll on his native <b>Argeș</b> <b>County,</b> the Marshal himself established Antonești, a model village in Corbeni (partly built by Ukrainian prisoners of war, and later passed into state property), while ordering hydroelectric exploitation of the Argeș River. He also had sporadic contacts with the artistic and literary environment, including an interview he awarded to his supporter, writer Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voinești. His 1946 trial was notably attended and documented by George Călinescu {{in a series of articles}} for Națiunea journal. Political humor of the 1940s preserved distinct images of the Romanian leader. Romanian jokes circulated under Antonescu's rule ridiculed his adoption of the title Marshal of Romania, viewing it as a self-promotion and dubbing him the [...] "Auto-Marshal". During the war, Soviet agitprop portrayed Antonescu and the other secondary Axis leaders as villains and servile dog-like creatures, representations notably present in musical theater and puppetry shows, as well as in press cartoons.|$|E
