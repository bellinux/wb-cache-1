40|$|In March of 2007, {{fishing in}} the Central Gulf of Alaska {{rockfish}} fisheries began under a new share-based management program. Under this program, cooperatives receive <b>annual</b> <b>allocations</b> of rockfish and other species (including halibut prohibited species catch) based on the qualified catch histories of their members. These <b>annual</b> <b>allocations</b> are binding without provision to cover any overage or compensate for any underage. This action considers allowing harvesters to engage in post-delivery transfers of their respective shares to cover overages. Purpose and Need Statement The Council has adopted the following the purpose and need statement for this action: Participants in the Central Gulf of Alaska rockfish fishery pilot program are permitted to join cooperatives, which receive <b>annual</b> <b>allocations</b> of cooperative quota, which provide exclusive privileges to catch specific numbers of pounds of Pacific ocean perch, northern rockfish, pelagic shelf rockfish, Pacific cod, sablefish, thornyhead rockfish, shortraker rockfish, rougheye rockfish, and halibut prohibited species catch. Any harvest in excess of a cooperative quota allocation is a regulatory violation punishable by confiscation of catch and other penalties.

40|$|Since its creation, {{through the}} {{establishment}} in 1958 {{of the two}} sectoral funds - European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), Cohesion Policy has acted as a payment mechanism for redistribution of budgetary contributions between Member States {{in order to reduce}} regional development disparities between them. The main items discussed in this article are the objectives and mechanisms of the Cohesion Policy, the evolution of budget allocations and main pillars of this common policy reform. Our paper also proposes a comparative analysis between the objectives of the new funding framework of the Cohesion Policy for the period 2014 - 2020 and the <b>annual</b> <b>allocations</b> in 2007 - 2013, with a focus on "lessons learned" and the congruence of this common policy objectives to those of Europe 2020 Strategy...|$|E
40|$|Current {{conditions}} {{of political and}} economic development in the Central Asian Republics of Uzbekistan, Kazakstan, Kyrgizstan, Tadjikistan, and Turkmenestan require new systems of analyzing water management. A water allocation model for the Aral Sea basin based on multiobjective optimization and water balance principles is being developed which can be used to evaluate the efficiency and sustainability of water use in the region. The model will be a decision aid for water distribution planning and an instrument that will be sustainable by and useful to local specialists. The first step has been the construction of a multiobjective model to investigate <b>annual</b> <b>allocations</b> of water in the Amudarya River basin. The objectives considered in the model include maximizing the flow to the Aral Sea, maximizing the satisfaction of demands for water in the basin, and equalizing the distribution of water deficits in the basin...|$|E

40|$|Working {{counsellors}} {{and therapists}} most often work in relative isolation, meeting {{to report on}} “cases ” at best but rarely witnessing their colleagues ’ work. <b>Annual</b> <b>allocations</b> for professional development, if they are available at all, typically lead to practitioners enrolling in disparate trainings offered {{by a variety of}} experts often disconnected from front line work. Alternately, all workers in an agency or region are given a one-size-fits-all training. Either way, the professional development is only temporarily energizing and learnings quickly dissipate without the opportunity for ongoing dialogue within a community of learners. This compartmentalization of professional development squanders the opportunity for lateral knowledge exchange among practitioners and increases the chances of burnout associated with professional isolation. This paper describes how the dilemmas have been addressed through the formation of inter-agency “collaborative practice groups ” of therapists and counsellors in Ottawa, Canada.

The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, passed by the U. S. Congress in 2005, eliminated some of these programs and created new opportunities. Accordingly, the list of funding sources was updated based on information available as of December 2005. State and federal funding sources and programs, and their potential uses, are detailed in this report.

30|$|In model 1 with a {{cash-flow}} of $ 0.5 m/year, {{the chance}} of finding a compound is 3.5 % and falling slightly over the coming years due to the chance that a compound has been found during the previous years and the discovery work will be discontinued. The decrease becomes higher with increasing annual allocation and with a cash-flow of $ 3 m/year, it is after four years half of the probability of the first year. While using model 3, the probability weighted amount of compounds found with an annual investment of $ 0.5 m is only slightly higher than what was found for model 1, an increase that {{is due to the}} fact that in model 1 only one compound can be found, but more than one in model 3. However, the probability of finding two compounds suitable for development with this limited budget is very low. With increasing <b>annual</b> <b>allocations,</b> the probability of finding a second compound starts to affect the probability rate considerably.|$|E
