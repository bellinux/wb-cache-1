5|$|A feigned retreat by the Picts {{drew the}} Northumbrians into <b>an</b> <b>ambush</b> at Dun Nechtain near the lake of Linn Garan.

5|$|Ecgfrith's {{attack on}} Fortriu was made against the counsel of his advisors, {{including}} Cuthbert, {{who had recently}} been made Bishop of Lindisfarne.

The Northumbrian army was defeated and Ecgfrith slain.|$|E

50|$|<b>As</b> <b>ambush</b> predators, crotalines {{typically}} wait patiently somewhere for unsuspecting prey {{to wander}} by. At least one species, the arboreal Gloydius shedaoensis of China, {{is known to}} select <b>a</b> specific <b>ambush</b> site and return to it every year {{in time for the}} spring migration of birds. Studies have indicated these snakes learn to improve their strike accuracy over time.|$|R

5|$|The marbled {{electric}} ray is <b>an</b> <b>ambush</b> predator that employs electricity to capture prey. Vision is of little importance in hunting, as the ray's eyes are often obscured as it lies buried on the bottom. Instead, it likely relies on the mechanoreceptors of its lateral line, as it only attacks moving prey. The electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini may also contribute to prey detection.|$|E
5|$|Al-Kharrat {{was killed}} in <b>an</b> <b>ambush</b> by French troops in the Ghouta on 25 December 1925. He was succeeded as qabaday of al-Shaghour and {{commander}} of the ′isabat al-Shawaghirah by Mahmud Khaddam al-Srija. Al-Kharrat's men continued to fight the French until the revolt ended in 1927, though historian Thomas Philipp states that al-Kharrat's group dissipated after his death. In January 1926, al-Kharrat's son Fakhri {{was sentenced to death}} and publicly executed with two other rebels in Marjeh Square, Damascus. The French had previously implored Fakhri to persuade his father to surrender in return for his release, but Fakhri refused.|$|E
5|$|Amid growing {{military}} setbacks, Vietnam {{signed the}} Treaty of Saigon in June 1862, losing three southern provinces {{which became the}} French colony of Cochinchina. Tự Đức hoped that by abiding by the treaty, Vietnam could eventually negotiate the future return of the territory. He ordered the partisans to disband, but Định refused to recognise the treaty and disobeyed the monarch, fighting on in defense of his homeland. With the loss of imperial support, Định's forces began to struggle against the superior resources of the French. His men were gradually worn down and, following <b>an</b> <b>ambush,</b> Định committed suicide to avoid being captured.|$|E

5|$|<b>An</b> <b>ambush</b> predator, the Pacific {{angelshark}} conceals {{itself on}} the sea floor and waits for approaching prey, primarily bony fishes and squid. Prey are targeted visually and, with a quick upward thrust of the head, snatched in protrusible jaws. Individual sharks actively choose ideal ambush sites, where they stay for several days {{before moving on to}} a new one. This species is more active at night than during the day, when it stays buried in sediment and seldom moves. Reproduction is ovoviviparous, with the embryos hatching inside the mother's uterus and being sustained by a yolk sac until birth. Females give birth to an average of six young every spring.|$|E
5|$|Children of Men used several lengthy single-shot {{sequences}} {{in which}} extremely complex actions take place.

These sequences were extremely difficult to film, although the effect of continuity is sometimes an illusion, aided by CGI effects.|$|E

He decided to invade and occupy Midway Atoll, which he was sure would draw out the American carriers to defend it. The Japanese codenamed the Midway invasion Operation MI. Unknown to the Japanese, the US Navy had divined the Japanese plan by breaking its JN-25 code and had prepared <b>an</b> <b>ambush</b> using its three available carriers, positioned northeast of Midway.|$|E

Leaving the car to evade Castafiore's singing, Tintin is arrested again and survives another assassination attempt before arrival in Klow on foot. There, he meets the King's aide-de-camp, Colonel Boris; but Boris is also a conspirator and organises a further unsuccessful assassination attempt aimed at Tintin.|$|E

He died from his injuries a week later. Nazi intelligence falsely linked the assassins to the villages of Lidice and Ležáky.

5|$|Hearing {{the shots}} from the {{northern}} side of the river, Forbes uneasily moved towards the southern bank, intending to cross and help Wilson. However, Forbes's fears of <b>an</b> <b>ambush</b> proved to be well-founded; at an opportune moment, the Matabele in the scrub opened fire, catching the column in the open. The ambushers' shots were initially wild and inaccurate, but they soon began to focus their fire on the exposed Maxim guns and horses, forcing the troopers to retreat to cover. Five Company soldiers were injured. The resulting skirmish lasted about an hour, by which time the Shangani had been severely swollen by heavy rains upstream, causing it to flood.|$|E
