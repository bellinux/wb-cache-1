However, {{he seems to have}} led a relatively normal life until September 1828, when new symptoms such as effusions of blood appeared. At this stage he moved from the Vienna home of his friend Franz von Schober to his brother Ferdinand's house in the suburbs, following the advice of his doctor; unfortunately, this may have actually worsened his condition. However, up until the last weeks of his life in November 1828, he continued to compose <b>an</b> <b>extraordinary</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> music, including such masterpieces as the three last sonatas.|$|E

60|$|The Englishwoman's Year-Book {{contains}} <b>a</b> really <b>extraordinary</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> {{useful information}} on every subject connected with woman's work. In the census taken in 1831 (six {{years before the}} Queen ascended the Throne), no occupation whatever was specified as appertaining to women, except that of domestic service; but in the census of 1881, the number of occupations mentioned as followed by women is upwards of three hundred and thirty. The most popular occupations seem to be those of domestic service, school teaching, and dressmaking; the lowest numbers on the list are those of bankers, gardeners, and persons engaged in scientific pursuits. Besides these, the Year-Book makes mention of stockbroking and conveyancing as professions that women are beginning to adopt. The historical account of the literary work done by Englishwomen in this century, as given in the Year-Book, is curiously inadequate, and the list of women's magazines is not complete, but in all other respects the publication seems a most useful and excellent one.|$|R

There is a pleasing intimite about her style, and almost everything that she says has both good sense and good humour to recommend it. Nor does she confine herself to those broad generalisations on morals, which are so easy to make, so difficult to apply. Indeed, she seems to have a wholesome contempt for the cheap severity of abstract ethics, enters into the most minute details for the guidance of conduct, and draws out elaborate lists of what girls should avoid, and what they should cultivate.|$|R

25|$|One {{means of}} {{studying}} reionization uses the spectra of distant quasars. Quasars release <b>an</b> <b>extraordinary</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> energy, meaning {{they are among}} the brightest objects in the universe. As a result, some quasars are detectable from {{as far back as the}} epoch of reionization. Quasars also happen to have relatively uniform spectral features, regardless of their position in the sky or distance from the Earth. Thus it can be inferred that any major differences between quasar spectra will be caused by the interaction of their emission with atoms along the line of sight. For wavelengths of light at the energies of one of the Lyman transitions of hydrogen, the scattering cross-section is large, meaning that even for low levels of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM), absorption at those wavelengths is highly likely.|$|E

The Olive View Medical Center and Veterans Hospital both experienced very heavy damage, and buildings collapsed at both sites, causing the majority of deaths that occurred. The buildings at both facilities were constructed with mixed styles, but engineers were unable to thoroughly study the buildings' responses {{because they were not}} outfitted with instruments for recording strong ground motion, and this prompted the Veterans Administration to install seismometers at its high-risk sites. Other sites throughout the Los Angeles area had been instrumented as a result of local ordinances, and <b>an</b> <b>extraordinary</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> strong motion data was recorded, more so than any other event up until that time.

Mowing a lawn can be a difficult, tedious, and sometimes hazardous chore for the human operator. The goal {{of this paper is}} to report on ongoing research of using the visual property of texture to design a system which gives an autonomous lawnmower robot the ability to mow a lawn similar to how a human would (in some type of pattern). Previous autonomous lawnmowers that have been designed, the LawnNibbler and LawnShark for example, rely on the principle of randomness to mow in a confined area.

40|$|International audienceOwing to {{its high}} {{technological}} importance for optoelectronics, zinc oxide received much attention. In particular, {{the role of}} defects on its physical properties has been extensively studied {{as well as their}} thermodynamical stability. In particular, a large concentration of Zn vacancies in ZnO bulk materials is so far considered highly unstable. Here we report that the thermal decomposition of zinc peroxide produces wurtzite-​type ZnO nanoparticles with <b>an</b> <b>extraordinary</b> large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> zinc vacancies (> 15 ​%) ​. These Zn vacancies segregate at the surface of the nanoparticles, as confirmed by ab initio calculations, to form a pseudo core-​shell structure made of a dense ZnO sphere coated by a Zn free oxo-​hydroxide mono layer. In others terms, oxygen terminated surfaces are privileged over zinc-​terminated surfaces for passivation reasons what accounts for the Zn off-​stoichiometry observed in ultra-​fine powdered samples. Such Zn-​deficient Zn 1 -​xO nanoparticles exhibit an unprecedented photoluminescence signature suggesting that the core-​shell-​like edifice drastically influences the electronic structure of ZnO. This nanostructuration could be at the origin of the recent stabilisation of p-​type charge carriers in nitrogen-​doped ZnO nanoparticles...|$|R

60|$|Any one {{who will}} attentively {{consider}} the abstract now given, of the experiments made by many observers in several countries, will, I think, be convinced that by grafting two varieties of the potato together in various ways, hybridised plants can be produced. It should be observed {{that several of the}} experimentalists are scientific horticulturists, and some of them potato-growers on a large scale, who, though beforehand sceptical, have been fully convinced of the possibility, even of the ease, of making graft- hybrids. The only way of escaping from this conclusion is to attribute all the many recorded cases to simple bud-variation. Undoubtedly the potato, as we have seen in this chapter, does sometimes, though not often, vary by buds; but it should be especially noted that it is experienced potato- growers, whose business it is to look out for new varieties, who have expressed unbounded astonishment at the number of new forms produced by graft-hybridisation. It may be argued that it is merely the operation of grafting, and not the union of two kinds, which causes so <b>extraordinary</b> <b>an</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> bud-variation; but this objection is at once answered by the fact that potatoes are habitually propagated by the tubers being cut into pieces, and the sole difference in the case of graft-hybrids is that either a half or a smaller segment or a cylinder is placed in close opposition with the tissue of another variety. Moreover, in two cases, the young stems were grafted together, and the plants thus united yielded the same results as when the tubers were united. It is an argument of the greatest weight that when varieties are produced by simple bud-variation, they frequently present quite new characters; whereas in all the numerous cases above given, as Herr Magnus likewise insists, the graft-hybrids are intermediate in character between the two forms employed. That such a result should follow if the one kind did not affect the other is incredible.|$|R

500|$|No {{artist was}} ever more true to his aim. Ideals resolutely pursued {{are apt to}} provoke the resentment of the world, and Burne-Jones encountered, endured and conquered <b>an</b> <b>extraordinary</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> angry criticism. Insofar as this was {{directed}} against the lack of realism in his pictures, it was beside the point. The earth, the sky, the rocks, the trees, {{the men and women}} of Burne-Jones are not those of this world; but they are themselves a world, consistent with itself, and having therefore its own reality. Charged with the beauty and with the strangeness of dreams, it has nothing of a dream's incoherence. Yet it is a dreamer always whose nature penetrates these works, a nature out of sympathy with struggle and strenuous action. Burne-Jones's men and women are dreamers too. It was this which, more than anything else, estranged him from the age into which he was born. But he had an inbred [...] "revolt from fact" [...] which would have estranged him from the actualities of any age. That criticism seems to be more justified which has found in him a lack of such victorious energy and mastery over his materials as would have enabled him to carry out his conceptions in their original intensity. Yet Burne-Jones was singularly strenuous in production. His industry was inexhaustible, and needed to be, if it was to keep pace with the constant pressure of his ideas. Whatever faults his paintings may have, they have always the fundamental virtue of design; they are always pictures. His designs were informed with a mind of romantic temper, apt in the discovery of beautiful subjects, and impassioned with a delight in pure and variegated colour.|$|E
