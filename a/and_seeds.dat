5|$|When {{they were}} first cultivated, carrots were grown for their {{aromatic}} leaves <b>and</b> <b>seeds</b> rather than their roots. Carrot seeds {{have been found in}} Switzerland and Southern Germany dating back to 2000â€“3000 BC. Some close relatives of the carrot are still grown for their leaves <b>and</b> <b>seeds,</b> such as parsley, cilantro, coriander, fennel, anise, dill and cumin. The first mention of the root in classical sources is from the 1st century; the Romans ate a root vegetable called pastinaca, which may have been either the carrot or the closely related parsnip.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to fruit <b>and</b> <b>seeds,</b> {{a number of}} other food items are taken by many species. Some, particularly the ground doves and quail-doves, eat a large number of prey items such as insects and worms. One species, the atoll fruit dove, is specialised in taking insect and reptile prey. Snails, moths, and other insects are taken by white-crowned pigeons, orange fruit doves, and ruddy ground doves.|$|E

5|$|M.pithecoides {{from the}} central plateau was a {{specialized}} leaf-eater (folivore), but the other two species had a more mixed diet, eating fruits <b>and</b> <b>seeds</b> in addition to leaves. The level of seed predation varies between the three species, with tooth wear indicating that M.dolichobrachion exhibited the greatest level of seed predation within the genus.|$|E
5|$|Plant food {{includes}} the fruits <b>and</b> <b>seeds</b> of bushes and trees, mainly holly, yew, ivy and mistletoe, but also, for example, blackberry, cherry, elder, hawthorn, olive and rose.

5|$|Seeds are {{the primary}} way that trees {{reproduce}} and their seeds vary greatly in size and shape. Some of the largest seeds come from trees, but the largest tree, Sequoiadendron giganteum, produces {{one of the smallest}} tree seeds. The great diversity in tree fruits <b>and</b> <b>seeds</b> reflects the many different ways that tree species have evolved to disperse their offspring.|$|E
5|$|Sunflower seeds, called garinim (literally, seeds), are eaten everywhere, on outings, at stadiums and at home. They {{are usually}} {{purchased}} unshelled and are cracked open with the teeth. They {{can be bought}} freshly roasted from shops and market stalls that specialize in nuts <b>and</b> <b>seeds</b> as well as packaged in supermarkets, along with the also well-liked pumpkin and watermelon seeds, pistachios, and sugar-coated peanuts.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} voalavo probably largely {{lives on}} the ground, but is able to climb in vegetation.

5|$|Very {{little is}} known of the ecology of eastern voalavo, but {{northern}} voalavo {{is thought to be}} largely terrestrial with some scansorial (tree-climbing) abilities.

5|$|As omnivores, Campbell's dwarf hamsters eat {{a variety}} of {{different}} foods. A balanced diet for a hamster consists of 16-24% protein, 60-65% carbohydrates, and 5â€“7% fat, with constant access to fresh water. In their natural habitats, dwarf hamsters feed almost exclusively on plant materials. In captivity, Campbell's dwarf hamsters can get the required nutrition from commercially available food designed specifically for hamsters, which typically contain a mix of dry grains, nuts, <b>and</b> <b>seeds</b> that may be fortified with vitamins and minerals. An excess of any one particular seed or nut can lead to digestive problems, obesity, and forms nutritional deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{live on the}} ground, {{are active}} during the night, are solitary, and feed mainly on fruits <b>and</b> <b>seeds,</b> but may also eat herbs and insects. They build nests of leaves and {{branches}} among vegetation, for example in a tree hollow, or under rocks. In Panama, T.talamancae breeds throughout the year and the average litter size is about six. Various species of mites, chiggers, fleas, and sucking lice have been recorded as parasites on both species.|$|E

5|$|Found in grasslands {{and open}} {{woodlands}} dominated by Eucalyptus and Callitris trees, the turquoise parrot feeds mainly on grasses <b>and</b> <b>seeds</b> and occasionally flowers, fruit and scale insects. It nests in hollows of gum trees. Much of its habitat has been altered and potential nesting sites lost. Predominantly sedentary, the turquoise parrot can be locally nomadic. Populations {{appear to be}} recovering from a crash in the early 20th century. The turquoise parrot has been kept in captivity since the 19th century, and several colour variants exist.|$|E
5|$|Herbivores eat plants, but {{plants can}} defend {{themselves}} and some species are parasitic or even carnivorous. Other organisms form mutually beneficial relationships with plants. For example, mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia provide plants with nutrients {{in exchange for}} food, ants are recruited by ant plants to provide protection, honey bees, bats and other animals pollinate flowers and humans and other animals act as dispersal vectors to spread spores <b>and</b> <b>seeds.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the ground, they dig for {{earthworms}} and grubs, {{and they}} search for beetles, cicada, crickets, flies, weta, spiders, caterpillars, slugs and snails on the ground. They will also feed on berries <b>and</b> <b>seeds.</b> To find prey, the great spotted kiwi use their scenting skills or feel vibrations {{caused by the}} movement of their prey. To do the latter, a kiwi would stick its beak into the ground, then use its beak to dig into the ground. As they are nocturnal, they do not emerge until thirty minutes after sunset to begin the hunt. Kiwis will also swallow small stones, which aid in digestion.|$|E
