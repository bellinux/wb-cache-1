40|$|Although {{the effects}} of iconic culture priming are well documented, {{it is unclear how}} it works. The intersubjective {{approach}} posits that a cultural icon activates intersubjective values (values that are perceived to be widely shared among others) and elevates evaluations of attitude objects that stand for these values. Results from two studies reveal that Americans believe that George Bush and iconic <b>American</b> <b>businesses</b> embody the same intersubjective values (Study 1). Moreover, priming Bush increases Americans??? evaluations of iconic <b>American</b> <b>businesses</b> and priming Obama decreases it, despite the fact that Americans generally like Obama more and do not endorse the values Bush and <b>American</b> <b>businesses</b> represent (Study 2) ...|$|R

Arranged by Richard Nixon and Secretary of Commerce Maurice Stans, it was the first such meeting ever held that focused solely on <b>American</b> <b>business</b> and the future.

5|$|There was broad {{agreement}} between Taft and Knox on major foreign policy goals; the U.S. would not interfere in European affairs, and would use force {{if necessary to}} enforce the Monroe Doctrine in the Americas. The defense of the Panama Canal, which was under construction throughout Taft's term (it opened in 1914), guided United States {{foreign policy in the}} Caribbean and Central America. Previous administrations had made efforts to promote <b>American</b> <b>business</b> interests overseas, but Taft went a step further and used the web of American diplomats and consuls abroad to further trade. Such ties, Taft hoped, would promote world peace. Taft pushed for arbitration treaties with Great Britain and France, but the Senate was not willing to yield its constitutional prerogative to approve treaties to arbitrators.|$|E
5|$|Closer to home, McKinley and Hay {{engaged in}} {{negotiations}} with Britain over the possible construction of a canal across Central America. The Clayton–Bulwer Treaty, which the two nations signed in 1850, prohibited either from establishing exclusive control over a canal there. The war had exposed the difficulty of maintaining a two-ocean navy without a connection closer than Cape Horn. Now, with <b>American</b> <b>business</b> and military interests even more involved in Asia, a canal seemed more essential than ever, and McKinley pressed for a renegotiation of the treaty. Hay and the British ambassador, Julian Pauncefote, agreed that the United States could control a future canal, provided that it was open to all shipping and not fortified. McKinley was satisfied with the terms, but the Senate rejected them, demanding that the United States be allowed to fortify the canal. Hay was embarrassed by the rebuff and offered his resignation, but McKinley refused it and ordered him to continue negotiations to achieve the Senate's demands. He was successful, and a new treaty was drafted and approved, but not before McKinley's assassination in 1901.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. had intervened {{repeatedly}} in Mexico under Wilson, and had withdrawn diplomatic recognition, setting conditions for reinstatement. The Mexican government under President Álvaro Obregón wanted recognition before negotiations, but Wilson and his final Secretary of State, Bainbridge Colby, refused. Both Hughes and Fall opposed recognition; Hughes instead sent a draft treaty to the Mexicans in May 1921, which included pledges to reimburse Americans for losses in Mexico since the 1910 revolution there. Obregón {{was unwilling to}} sign a treaty before being recognized, and worked to improve the relationship between <b>American</b> <b>business</b> and Mexico, reaching agreement with creditors, and mounting a public relations campaign in the United States. This had its effect, and by mid-1922, Fall was less influential than he had been, lessening the resistance to recognition. The two presidents appointed commissioners to reach a deal, and the U.S. recognized the Obregón government on August 31, 1923, just under a month after Harding's death, substantially on the terms proffered by Mexico.|$|E
