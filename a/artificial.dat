5|$|<b>Artificial</b> {{birth control}} predates Christianity; the Catholic Church has {{condemned}} these methods throughout its history. In {{response to the}} Church of England accepting the practice of <b>artificial</b> contraception in 1930, the Catholic Church issued the papal encyclical Casti connubii on 31 December 1930. The 1968 papal encyclical Humanae vitae is a reaffirmation of the Catholic Church's traditional view of marriage and marital relations, and a continued condemnation of <b>artificial</b> birth control.|$|E
5|$|<b>Artificial</b> {{lighting}} discourages nesting and {{interferes with}} the hatchlings' ability to navigate to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of <b>artificial</b> lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, perhaps because they block out the man-made light sources. Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward the brighter area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. Confused by the brighter <b>artificial</b> light, they navigate inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises. <b>Artificial</b> lighting causes {{tens of thousands of}} hatchling deaths per year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Artificial</b> trees made of goose {{feathers}} were {{in use in}} American homes {{since the}} 1880s. In the 1930s, however, The Addis Brush Company, an American toilet bowl brush manufacturer, began making <b>artificial</b> trees of green-dyed bristles and then supplied the British (who suffered a dearth of wild trees) with thousands of <b>artificial</b> trees in the post-War years. Americans took {{little interest in the}} Addis <b>artificial</b> trees and remained loyal to real trees.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of construction, <b>artificial</b> lakes were {{typically}} long and straight. The Serpentine {{was one of the}} earliest <b>artificial</b> lakes designed to appear natural, and was widely imitated in parks and gardens nationwide.|$|E
5|$|Electropalatography {{involves}} the use of a custom-fitted <b>artificial</b> palate containing electrodes that measure contact. While able to record multiple contacts, the <b>artificial</b> palate may obstruct or interfere with articulation, and each subject requires a custom-fitted palate.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s and 50s, {{a handful}} of {{scientists}} {{from a variety of}} fields (mathematics, psychology, engineering, economics and political science) began to discuss the possibility of creating an <b>artificial</b> brain. The field of <b>artificial</b> intelligence research was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Jacques Pitrat {{claims that}} some kind of <b>artificial</b> {{conscience}} is beneficial in <b>artificial</b> intelligence systems to improve their long-term performance and direct their introspective processing.|$|E

5|$|A {{controversy}} arose regarding {{whether to}} lay natural or <b>artificial</b> turf. Kristofer Hæstad, one of Start's star players, {{stated that he}} would not continue to play for the club if <b>artificial</b> turf was laid. The contract with the municipality stated that the stadium would have to be built with <b>artificial</b> turf. In March, Start decided that they would instead lay natural grass, and if necessary pay the municipality for the cost of building another <b>artificial</b> turf venue. The name of the venue was announced on 21 October, after the club had signed a ten-year naming rights agreement with Sparebanken Sør worth NOK35 million. The rights to sell the naming rights were first transferred from the stadium owner to the company Rettighetskompaniet AS, which subsequently sold these to Sparebanken Sør.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} after {{starting}} work on the canal, the Member had an <b>artificial</b> lake built on a flat piece of land {{to the front of}} the mansion house. The landscape gardener William S Gilpin was carrying out work on the adjacent Strichen estate at about the same time, and it is assumed he gave help with the work at Pitfour. The lake extends to almost 50 acres and was based on the <b>artificial</b> lake at Windsor Great Park.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{surveys of}} the site have {{confirmed}} {{that there was a}} very large <b>artificial</b> enclosure, roughly circular in shape, within which are what is left of several circular and rectangular basins. The basins may be identified with the <b>artificial</b> pools described by the court poet Ali ibn Muhammad el-Iyadi, which surrounded the palace. The foundations have been revealed through archaeological excavations. Traces of the great hall's columns are still visible. Some parts of the canal can still be seen.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of 1997, the {{municipal}} council granted NOK3.2 million to lay <b>artificial</b> turf at Dælenenga. Construction started in May and the pitch {{was taken into}} use on 4 September 1997. The new turf was Belgian-manufactured, sand-filled Superfoot 32. The upgrade also saw the first upgrades to the terraces in the stadium's history. New <b>artificial</b> turf was laid in 2008.|$|E
5|$|<b>Artificial</b> {{lighting}} {{has been}} suggested as another potential cause. Insects are attracted to lights making them scarcer within the amphibian habitats.|$|E
5|$|<b>Artificial</b> ruins, {{built to}} {{resemble}} remnants of historic edifices, {{were also a}} hallmark of the period. They were usually built as centre pieces in aristocratic planned landscapes. Follies were similar, although they differed from <b>artificial</b> ruins in that they were not part of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built. Both drew on elements of castle architecture such as castellation and towers, but served no military purpose and were solely for display.|$|E
5|$|Black & White {{received}} universal acclaim on release; reviewers {{praised the}} <b>artificial</b> intelligence, uniqueness, and depth, although the system requirements and bugs were criticised. Black & White won awards from several organisations, including the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and the Guinness World Record for {{the complexity of}} the <b>artificial</b> intelligence, selling over two million copies. Later re-reviews of the game considered it to have been over-rated at the time. An expansion, , and sequel, Black & White 2, followed.|$|E

5|$|Habitat {{enhancements}} used {{to increase}} the breeding success of terns include floating nest platforms for black, common and Caspian terns, and <b>artificial</b> islands created {{for a number of}} different species. More specialised interventions include providing nest boxes for roseate terns, which normally nest in the shelter of tallish vegetation, and using <b>artificial</b> eelgrass mats to encourage common terns to nest in areas not vulnerable to flooding.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, a {{competition}} {{for the design of}} Canberra was launched, and Scrivener's detailed survey of the area was supplied to the competing architects. The Molonglo River flowed through the site, which was a flood plain and Scrivener's survey showed in grey an area clearly representing an <b>artificial</b> lake—similar to the lake later created—and four possible locations for a dam to create it. Most of the proposals took the hint and included <b>artificial</b> bodies of water.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, {{a project}} was started to bring Bodø/Glimt {{back to the}} top league. Among the most {{important}} issues was to secure better training facilities, particularly during the Arctic winter. The club proposed upgrading the <b>artificial</b> turf field at Aspmyra with a new field with under-soil heating, in addition to constructing both a new gravel pitch and an indoor training hall with a full-size pitch. The Municipal Committee for Sport and Culture stated that they wanted to prioritize the <b>artificial</b> turf field over a gravel pitch. They therefore proposed that NOK3.5 million be allocated to lay under-soil heating on the <b>artificial</b> turf pitch and remove the turf. New <b>artificial</b> turf would be laid at a later date, when funding could be allocated. This was agreed upon, construction started on 24 October 1989 and was scheduled for completion ahead of the winter training. However, the Football Association of Norway (NFF) stated that the club {{would not be allowed to}} play their matches on a gravel pitch, and the grass at Aspmyra was in so bad condition that it would not be permitted for play in the top league, should the team be promoted. The municipal council therefore gave grants to finance a new <b>artificial</b> turf on the training pitch, which was taken into use in 1990.|$|E
5|$|In {{both their}} native and {{introduced}} ranges, C.mutica are also synanthropic, being found abundantly in fouling communities in <b>artificial</b> structures like submerged ropes, fishing nets, pilings, docks, buoys, aquaculture equipment, oil rig platforms, ship hulls, and even offshore wind farms. In their introduced ranges (particularly in Europe), they are primarily and even exclusively found inhabiting <b>artificial</b> structures.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} science, {{simulations of}} evolution using evolutionary algorithms and <b>artificial</b> life {{started in the}} 1960s and were extended with simulation of <b>artificial</b> selection. <b>Artificial</b> evolution became a widely recognised optimisation method {{as a result of}} the work of Ingo Rechenberg in the 1960s. He used evolution strategies to solve complex engineering problems. Genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the writing of John Henry Holland. Practical applications also include automatic evolution of computer programmes. Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi-dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers and also to optimise the design of systems.|$|E
5|$|Jordal Amfi, {{an outdoor}} <b>artificial</b> ice rink, was built with a {{capacity}} for 10,000 spectators. This allowed ice hockey to be played on <b>artificial</b> ice {{for the first time}} at the Olympics. Of the tournament's 36 matches, 23 were played at Jordal, while the remaining were played at Kadettangen in Bærum, Dælenenga idrettspark in Oslo, Lillestrøm stadion in Skedsmo and Marienlyst stadion in Drammen.|$|E
5|$|Lillestrøm idrettspark, colloquially {{known as}} Lillestrøm stadion, is a sports {{facility}} located at Lillestrøm in Skedsmo, Norway. The main venue is Romerike friidrettsstadion, an athletics stadium with eight all-weather running tracks. It has multiple football pitches, including one with <b>artificial</b> turf {{and one with}} gravel. The park features of two arenas, LSK-Hallen with a full-size <b>artificial</b> football pitch and Skedsmohallen for indoor sports. The venue is located adjacent to Åråsen Stadion, the home ground of Lillestrøm SK. The main tenants for Lillestrøm idrettspark are Flisbyen BK and Focus FK in football, and Strømmen IF, Lørenskog FIL and Minerva IS in athletics. The stadium opened on 6 June 1920 and was the main venue for Lillestrøm SK until 1951. The athletics stadium opened two years later. In 2004, the <b>artificial</b> turf pitch was laid and in 2007 a new athletics venue and LSK-Hallen opened.|$|E

5|$|Natural rubies are {{corundum}} (aluminum oxide) crystals {{that are}} colored red (the rarest type) due to chromium (III) ions (other colors of corundum gems are termed sapphires). A red-colored <b>artificial</b> ruby {{may also be}} achieved by doping chromium(III) into <b>artificial</b> corundum crystals, thus making chromium a requirement for making synthetic rubies. Such a synthetic ruby crystal {{was the basis for}} the first laser, produced in 1960, which relied on stimulated emission of light from the chromium atoms in such a crystal.|$|E

5|$|Purely natural {{sources were}} {{insufficient}} {{in some areas}} and additional steps taken to increase supplies. In New England, holes were drilled in the ice to promote the thickening of the surface. Alternatively, <b>artificial</b> lakes were created in some areas, and guidance was published {{on how best to}} construct the dams that lay at the heart of these designs. Low-lying, boggy land was dammed and flooded in Maine {{towards the end of the}} century to meet surge demands, while pre-existing <b>artificial</b> mill ponds in Wisconsin turned out to be ideal for harvesting commercial ice. In Alaska, a large, shallow <b>artificial</b> lake covering around 40 acres (16 hectares) was produced in order to assist in ice production and harvesting; similar approaches were taken in the Aleutian islands; in Norway this was taken further, with a number of <b>artificial</b> lakes up to half a mile long built on farmland to increase supplies, including some built out into the sea to collect fresh water for ice.|$|E
