5|$|Hamming {{set himself}} {{the task of}} solving this problem, which he {{realised}} would have an enormous range of applications. Each bit can only be a zero or a one, so if you know which bit is wrong, then it can be corrected. In a landmark paper published in 1950, he introduced a concept {{of the number of}} positions in which two code words differ, and therefore how many changes are required to transform one code word into another, which is today known as the Hamming distance. Hamming thereby created a family of mathematical error-correcting code, which are called Hamming codes. This not only solved an important problem in telecommunications and computer science, it opened up <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> field of study.|$|E
5|$|Pre-1927 Route 10 was legislated in 1916 to {{run from}} Paterson east by way of Hackensack and Ridgefield to the Public Service Railway's Fort Lee Ferry at Edgewater. From Paterson it used the {{existing}} Paterson and Hackensack Turnpike (Market Street and Essex Street) to Hackensack and the Bergen Turnpike (Hudson Street) to Ridgefield. Rather than use existing roads from Ridgefield down the Palisades to Edgewater, <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> route was surveyed with better grades. This road was built by 1922. At its east end, Route 10 ran south several blocks on River Road to the ferry, just south of Dempsey Avenue. In Ridgefield, Broad Avenue was used to get between the new alignment and Bergen Turnpike.|$|E
5|$|Scandal, {{released}} by Shochiku in April 1950, {{was inspired by}} the director's personal experiences with, and anger towards, Japanese yellow journalism. The work is an ambitious mixture of courtroom drama and social problem film about free speech and personal responsibility, but even Kurosawa regarded the finished product as dramatically unfocused and unsatisfactory, and almost all critics agree. However, it would be Kurosawa's second film of 1950, Rashomon, that would ultimately win him, and Japanese cinema, <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> international audience.|$|E

5|$|The idea of {{it being}} a simpler project due to the {{original}} art being reusable {{turned out to be}} untrue: because so much time had passed since the original's release, there were multiple parts that had to be reworked, leading to a process similar to creating <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> game from scratch. All character graphics were redone, special effects were changed, and certain animations were added, such as sleeping animations. Some item placements were changed, the overall difficulty was adjusted, and some characters' battle statistics were altered; one such instance was making Kechi stronger than Oryu, due to it being perceived as illogical that a person with a sword would be weaker than a person fighting with her bare hands.|$|E
5|$|The {{preceding}} German large cruiser design, , was {{an incremental}} increase over previous armored cruisers. Blücher was armed with twelve 21cm(8.3in) guns, {{and designed to}} counter what the Germans knew about the British , which were assumed to be larger iterations of the basic armored cruiser type. Once sufficient information about the new British cruisers became available, {{it was obvious that}} they were not simply an enlargement on previous designs but <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> type of warship—the battlecruiser—to which Blücher was quite inferior. However, there were insufficient funds to alter Blüchers layout, so the cruiser assigned for 1907 would have to be an entirely new design.|$|E

5|$|In June 2016, Disney held special {{presentations of}} the film at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, {{entitled}} The Little Mermaid in Concert. The performances combined a screening of The Little Mermaid with live accompaniment by guest musicians, including Sara Bareilles (who performed as Ariel), Tituss Burgess, Darren Criss, Rebel Wilson and Norm Lewis (who performed as King Triton as a reprisal of {{his role in the}} stage adaptation). The four additional songs written for the stage adaptation were also incorporated into the presentation, accompanied by scenes {{of the film}}'s original concept art. During the third and final performance, Jodi Benson joined the cast in lieu of Bareilles to reprise her original role as Ariel. The final performance also featured special appearances by Brad Kane (the singing voice of the title character of Aladdin) and Susan Egan (who played Belle in the stage adaptation of Beauty and the Beast), who sang songs from their respective films, and a duet of <b>A</b> <b>Whole</b> <b>New</b> World.|$|E
5|$|Starting with Final FantasyVIII, {{the series}} adopted a more photo-realistic look. Like Final FantasyVII, full motion video (FMV) {{sequences}} would have video {{playing in the}} background, with the polygonal characters composited on top. Final FantasyIX returned to the more stylized design of earlier games in the series, although it still maintained, {{and in many cases}} slightly upgraded, most of the graphical techniques used in the previous two games. Final FantasyX was released on the PlayStation 2, and used the more powerful hardware to render graphics in real-time instead of using pre-rendered material to obtain a more dynamic look; the game features full 3D environments, rather than have 3D character models move about pre-rendered backgrounds. It is also the first Final Fantasy game to introduce voice acting, occurring throughout the majority of the game, even with many minor characters. This aspect added <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> dimension of depth to the character's reactions, emotions, and development.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{expedition}} ended in failure {{the members of}} the Uitvoerend Bewind became very nervous {{in the days before the}} Battle of Bergen. The Agent for Foreign Affairs, Van der Goes who had been in favor of distancing the Republic from the French, chose this inopportune moment to secretly approach the King of Prussia as a mediator, with a scheme in which the Hereditary Prince was to become a kind of constitutional monarch in a constitution on the model of the American Constitution. The Republic would revert to its traditional neutrality, while Britain would occupy North Holland, and France Zeeland. The overture was rejected, and it caused a lot of embarrassment in the relations with the French Directoire. At this time Napoleon Bonaparte performed his coup of 18 Brumaire, establishing the French Consulate. The Franco-Batavian relations now entered <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> era.|$|E
