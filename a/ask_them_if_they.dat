500|$|Wilson {{was absent}} from WWE {{television}} {{for quite some}} time after this, leading to rumors and false reports that she had been released from WWE. In actuality, she had taken a leave of absence to tend to some [...] "personal issues". Wilson was surprised by the rumors after some media personnel offered to help her find work. WWE issued a statement on their website, in which Wilson also commented, denouncing the rumors. In the statement she joked she had to [...] "call the WWE office and <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> forgot to fire me".|$|E
500|$|When {{those plans}} fell through, McLaren, Rhodes {{and the band}} began looking locally for a new member to assume the lead vocal duties. As {{described}} by Matlock, [...] "Everyone had long hair then, even the milkman, so {{what we used to}} do was if someone had short hair we would stop them in the street and <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> fancied themselves as a singer." [...] Among those they approached was Midge Ure, who was involved with his own band, Slik. Kevin Rowland—who would co-found Dexys Midnight Runners three years later—auditioned, but apart from Matlock, no one was impressed. With the search going nowhere, McLaren made several calls to Richard Hell, who turned down the invitation.|$|E
500|$|Instead, {{the work}} of {{assembling}} the C5 was given to The Hoover Company {{in the spring of}} 1983. The Welsh Development Agency (WDA) approached Hoover to <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> would be interested becoming the principal subcontractor for Sinclair, [...] "who are working on an electric car, and as a by-product of the research have designed an electrically assisted bicycle. They are looking for a subcontractor to whom they can entrust the assembly." [...] The proposal suited all sides. The WDA was keen to support the Hoover washing machine factory at Merthyr Tydfil, situated in the economically depressed South Wales Valleys. Hoover was enticed by Sinclair's projections of sales of 200,000 units a year, increasing to 500,000. Sinclair saw Hoover's plant and expertise as a good match for their fabrication techniques. A contract was signed within a few months.|$|E

2500|$|If a {{government}} loses a [...] "non-confidence" [...] motion traditionally the Prime Minister {{will ask the}} Governor General to call an election. The Governor General when approached by the Prime Minister who has lost {{a vote of confidence}} will traditionally call an election. However it is not assured as some assume. The Governor General also has the right to call the leader of the party they think would be most {{likely to be able to}} form government and <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> can form the government. This happened in 1926 and is referred to as the King-Byng Affair.|$|E
2500|$|Ragnar Bøe Elgsaas {{admitted}} having 'advanced' membership {{fees for}} {{people he had}} not asked {{if they wanted to}} be members. Each December, the board would phone people to <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> wanted to renew their membership. If they said yes, they would receive a giro in the mail. Elgsaas gave himself away, when stating [...] "if this was not the case, we would 'advance' for the member". Elgsaas later denied stating this. Of the 700 people who had been incorrectly registered as members, Elgsaas estimated that they had phoned about half of them. They used several rules of thumb to consider who wanted to be members, without actually asking them, including those who applied for membership during the year, those who had formerly had positions, those who had been to information meetings, and those whom they knew personally. He also confirmed it was impossible to recollect the NOK 30 that was advanced, because the information of who had confirmed was automatically deleted from the computer system.|$|E
60|$|So Rollo summoned {{courage to}} accost the persons who were {{consulting}} together, and to <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> wished {{to find some}} gentlemen {{to make up a}} party.|$|E
6000|$|... "Peter {{thought a}} great deal about this, and when he went back to Moscow, which was then the capital, he inquired and found that there were some people from Holland there. He <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> knew how to build ships. Some of them said they did. Then he <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> could not build him some small vessels, just like the Dutch ships of war. They said they could. So he made a bargain with them, and they built him several.|$|R
60|$|They chattered {{much about}} many things, and told Halvor {{of this and}} of that, and at last he <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had never had any child.|$|R
50|$|Maths Class first gained {{publicity}} {{when they}} approached Shitdisco, who were playing at The Great Escape, and <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> could support <b>them</b> {{at their house}} party.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{will not}} be much," [...] William de Blois replied, [...] "among five hundred men, still {{it will be better}} than nothing. Will you row and <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> will sell to us?" ...|$|E
60|$|Another {{good way}} we {{discovered}} of irritating the aristocratic type of steam launch, was to mistake {{them for a}} beanfeast, and <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were Messrs. Cubit’s lot or the Bermondsey Good Templars, and could they lend us a saucepan.|$|E
60|$|He tried {{several times}} to <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had been robbed {{on the way home}} last night, as he had done in the scene he had dramatised; but he could not get out a word except that it had been pretty warm all day.|$|E
40|$|The {{author of}} this article {{mentions}} how some Maltese readers and writers find the Maltese language problematic; a puzzle which may appear too random and difficult to piece together and so they condemn and question {{the use of the}} language. The author goes on to debate this argument by <b>asking</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> ever took a moment to understand the Maltese language. He <b>asks</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> ever read a verse by Dun Karm, or a few words by Professor Temi Zammit insisting that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> did they would not certainly not see the Maltese language as a chaotic language. peer-reviewe...|$|R
60|$|On the {{way back}} to town but little was said. Near Brill they met quite a few {{students}} and the youngest Rover <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had seen his brother. All replied in the negative.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Alex (Ariel Winter), Luke (Nolan Gould) and Manny (Rico Rodriguez) {{stay home}} and babysit Lily (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons), who puts them in an awkward {{position}} when she starts <b>asking</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> know how babies are made.|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{you visit}} the sick, take especial {{care that they}} repeat to you the apostles' creed in their mother tongue. Interrogate them on every article, and <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> believe sincerely. After this, make them say the confiteor, and the other Catholic prayers, and then read the gospel over them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stay, friend," [...] {{interposed}} the queen, [...] "these accused are {{the subjects}} of our good brother, Henry of England, and may not understand our language, though one of them, I think"--and she glanced at Castell--"was not born in England, or at any rate of English blood. <b>Ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> need an interpreter." ...|$|E
6000|$|The time passed. Mrs. Makely sold {{chances to}} all the ladies in the house; on Friday night Reuben Camp brought her a hundred dollars; the head-waiter had already paid in twenty-five.

60|$|When {{he reached}} the {{building}} the young auctioneer peered into the hallway, but could see no one. Several little girls were playing upon the sidewalk, and he <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had seen any one go in.|$|R

50|$|Attitudes towards {{domestic}} violence are ambivalent even among women. A UNICEF survey of adolescent girls aged 15-19, covering the years 2002-2009, <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> {{think that a}} husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under certain circumstances; 57% responded yes.|$|R
6000|$|One day, {{as he sat}} in his palace {{looking out}} to sea, a great ship sailed into the harbour and several merchants came on shore.

6000|$|... "At any rate, I {{dare say}} {{you know the}} constables who are about here in the daytime.

6000|$|... "Of course I will go, Aunt, though I can't {{think what}} Frank has {{got in his}} head. Still, I am very tired of Weymouth, {{and it will be}} a change.

5000|$|Dan Henderson {{informed}} Team U.S. that Jason Pierce {{would not}} be fighting in the next match. Dana White called in Frank Lester and Mark Miller and <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> {{would be willing to}} replace Pierce. Both were willing to do so.|$|R
50|$|As Del Boy and Rodney are in {{the market}} {{conducting}} business as usual, Trigger arrives and <b>asks</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> will attend the funeral of his grandmother Alice.

60|$|The {{dinner was}} soon brought in, and Mr. George and Rollo ate it with {{excellent}} appetites. Just {{as they had}} finished their meal, a neatly-dressed young man came {{to the table and}} <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> wished for some one to show them about the town.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the robbers}} began to mutter {{to each other}} apart about {{what they should do}} with him, whether they should murder him, or what else they should do.

60|$|The Sergeant {{began by}} {{explaining}} {{the authority and}} business of the North-West Police, of whom it appeared {{one or two of}} the Indians had heard, after which he made Emile <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> knew Clarke.

50|$|As {{he returns}} from an {{obviously}} tiring mission, Wolverine encounters Hope and the Lights, including Transonic, awaiting his return {{so they can}} start Combat Training class.
