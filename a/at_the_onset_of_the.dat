Sadly the Aurora's damaged rudder forced her to return to New Zealand rather than returning for the stranded shore party.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the {{organization}} of the Roman fleets of late Antiquity, from the gradual break-up of the large provincial fleets into smaller squadrons in the 3rd century to the formation of a new navy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Muslim conquests. Despite the evidence of considerable naval activity in this period, earlier scholars believed that the Roman navy had all but vanished by the 4th century, but more recent work has altered this picture towards a transformation into a mainly fluvial and coastal force, designed for close co-operation with the army.|$|E

5|$|Written and {{produced}} by Hunt, What Were You Hoping For? expands on his previous work's blend of R and rock music forms. Hunt sought {{to achieve a}} rawer musical aesthetic and incorporated rough rhythms, rock dynamics, and studio effects. Inspired by Hunt's experience in Los Angeles <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late-2000s recession, the album's subject matter deals with issues in contemporary society and dissonance in modern life. Music writers have noted the album for its predominantly rock style, incorporation of funk and soul, eccentric songs, varying musical structure, and Hunt's eclectic vocal range.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2008 campaign, Hunter {{had served}} in Congress since 1981; {{representing}} California's 42nd (1981–83), 45th (1983-93), and 52nd (since 1993) congressional districts. During his tenure, he boasted a 92% lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union (ACU). Some of his successes included the passage of legislation leading {{to the construction of}} the 14-mile double-fence from the Pacific Ocean to Otay Mesa along the U.S.-Mexico border. He also helped pass the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which provided for the construction of an additional 670 miles of fence. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, Hunter pushed for increased military spending and advancements in military technology. He became chairman of the committee in 2003 and remained in the position until the Democratic Party won the majority of the House in the 2006 mid-term election.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> War of the Second Coalition in 1799, {{when the}} armies of the Danube and Helvetia were formed, he was {{assigned}} to the Army of the Danube under command of Jean Baptiste Jourdan. His 10th Regiment was part of Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr's III. Division, and held the far left flank at the Battle of Ostrach, 21 March 1799, in southwestern Germany. Although he was wounded on 14 August 1799 in Switzerland, he participated in the Second Battle of Zurich in which his 10th Chasseurs à Cheval routed a division of Russians, a decisive moment in the French victory. Ordener was promoted to colonel of the regiment in 1801 and on 29 August 1803, he was promoted to general of brigade.|$|E

5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{early modern}} period, the great European powers were France, the Holy Roman Empire and Spain. All three became {{involved}} in the War of the League of Cambrai in 1508. The conflict was initially aimed at the Republic of Venice but eventually turned against France. Through the Spanish possessions in the Low Countries, England had close economic ties with the Spanish Habsburgs, and it was the young Henry VIII's ambition to repeat the glorious martial endeavours of his predecessors. In 1509, six weeks into his reign, Henry married the Spanish princess Catherine of Aragon and joined the League, intent on certifying his historical claim as king of both England and France. By 1511 Henry was part of an anti-French alliance that included FerdinandII of Aragon, Pope JuliusII and Holy Roman emperor Maximilian.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> invasion, the Syrian force {{consisted}} of a reinforced infantry brigade, supplemented {{by at least one}} armored battalion (including Renault R35 tanks) and a field artillery battalion. The troops moved to Kafr Harib and were spotted by Haganah reconnaissance, but because the attack was not expected, the Israeli troops did not attack the invaders. At night between 15 and 16 May, the bulk of the Syrian forces set up camp in Tel al-Qasr in the southwestern Golan. One company with armored reinforcements split up to the south to proceed to the Jewish water station on the Yarmouk riverbank.|$|E

By the end of the decade, however, the Daddies' mainstream popularity declined with that of the swing revival's, and the resulting commercial failure of their ska-flavored follow-up Soul Caddy led to an abrupt hiatus in 2000.|$|E
