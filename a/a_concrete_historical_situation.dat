[...] By this, he is not only referring to a brute fact, or the factuality of <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>historical</b> <b>situation,</b> e.g., [...] "born in the '80s." [...] Facticity is something that already informs and has been taken up in existence, even if it is unnoticed or left unattended. As such, facticity is not something we come across and directly behold. In moods, for example, facticity has an enigmatic appearance, which involves both turning toward and away from it. For Heidegger, moods are conditions of thinking and willing to which they must in some way respond. The thrownness of human existence (or Dasein) is accordingly disclosed through moods.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to {{describe}} {{the attitude of the}} Spaniards to their native language. The turn of the 16 th century saw a considerable growth of interest in the languages spoken by {{the majority of the population}} in European countries. It was at that time that the Spanish-speaking community first recognized the value of their mother tongue and saw its merits as equal to those of Latin and Greek. As a result it is proved that in the Spanish mindset of the 16 th century the recognition of the priority of the Spanish Castilian took shape. It should be emphasized that this comprehension is politically grounded in <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>historical</b> <b>situation.</b> The role of the works written by the Renaissance humanists and the professional grammarians in the emergence of the national identity sense of the Spaniards is shown...|$|E
40|$|M. A. The {{fact that}} God (Yahweh) is often {{depicted}} in the Old Testament as violent is a problem. Especially for us {{who come to the}} text as modern readers. Even though our society is full of violent acts, there is a general remorse towards violence. A small book like Nahum is filled with violence and introduces Yahweh at an early stage as a “vengeful God”. It then goes further and describes the fall of Nineveh and the Assyrians in a graphic manner. This vengeful and violent God was central to the problem of this dissertation. The problem was: How should the violence in the current form of Nahum be interpreted and how should it be understood in a modern context. This study will make use of dual methodology {{due to the fact that}} the text of Nahum was rooted in <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> social and <b>historical</b> <b>situation.</b> Firstly the social and historical circumstances is studied and used to interpret the text. To understand the problem in a modern context the second part of the dual methodology will come into play. This will look at the ideology that is ingrained in the rhetoric of the text. The question will be asked whether Yahweh is as violent as He is described or whether His description in Nahum could be a construct of society and ideology. Proposals for new readings of Nahum and new metaphors and constructs for God is then suggested...|$|R

This dissertation is a comparative analysis of emergent visual {{cultures in the}} U. S. A., Europe, and South America {{within the context of}} the global political and economic crises of that moment. The period that frames the dissertation is the era economists have come to call "floating Bretton Woods," which saw the breakdown of the post-war economic order defined by the dollar-gold standard. By developing a theoretical framework to analyze a diverse and international set of media practices, I present an original historical account of a heterogeneous phenomenon in visual culture, which I call the "Cinema of the New Left. " Addressing avant-garde film, video, and television experiments that took place both within and alongside New Left political movements, I develop a new language for analyzing these movements in a moment of crucial global transition. In its approach to film form, my research is concerned with the re-emergence of the "essay film" within international avant-garde film cultures, and the manner in which this form was translated into different geopolitical contexts and media. Theoretically, this dissertation combines the fields of Film and Media Studies with the emerging field of Critical Financial Studies, and works to understand what Randy Martin calls the "financialization of daily life" at the level of visual culture. In essence, this dissertation draws together interdisciplinary historical and theoretical approaches in order to examine a process we might describe as the "financialization of the image," and seeks to ground this analysis in <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> set of <b>historical</b> <b>situations</b> that typify the transition between modernity and post-modernity, Fordism and post-Fordism, industrial and financial capitalism. While traditional analyses of the political economy of cinema focus on a critique of the commodity form, or on specific economic practices within film production (especially Hollywood cinema), this dissertation offers a new set of terms such as debt, inflation, and credit to the analysis of moving-image culture in order to better theorize the role of finance in shaping our contemporary visual environment...|$|R

Owing to the secularized society {{in which we live}} today the well known Martin Buber once spoke of the eclipse of the light of heaven as an eclipse of God and, we may add, an eclipse also of moral norms. A theocentric basis for moral norms should be accepted as well as the fact that the whole of creation is subject unconditionally to his cosmonomic order. Consequently there is <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> demand or claim on man in the situation he confronts, which cannot be reduced to an application of general moral norms to the situation concerned.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University, 15 / 05 / 2000. In the post-war period, Italy {{has been plagued by}} different forms of organised crime (such as the Sicilian Mafia, the Neapolitan Camorra, the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta and the Pugliese Sacra Corona Unita) which have managed in their individual ways to infiltrate both the State (in the form of political parties and local administrations) and society (businesses, cultural and voluntary organisations). In Campania, until 1991, the relationship between the Camorra and the local political elite (based on the exchange of votes for state contracts and protection) was tacitly accepted by the population and could not be studied by political scientists {{due to the lack of}} reliable source material. In 1991, a law was introduced which gave generous remission of sentences to criminals who became state-witness. Many members of the Camorra revealed important aspects of criminal, economic and political activities in Campania. This new material permitted a reexamination of the Camorra. This thesis on the Camorra hopes to fill a gap in the study of the relationship between politics and criminal organisations which so far has concentrated on the Sicilian Mafia. Part One is a general introduction and presents the theoretical model and methods adopted. The documentation available allowed us to adopt an agency-structure approach derived from Giddens's structuration theory (1984). This was complemented by Easton's systems analysis (1965) to understand the wider, macro-environment. We elaborated an 'interaction model' to analyse the changing nature of the Camorra's activities: from a simple social-criminal practice in the 1930 s to a dynamic and secret cartel enacting a political-criminal practice in the 1980 s. To test this model we applied it to case-studies of criminals using original judicial documents. In Part Two we look at the possible motives of people who join the Camorra. We analysed the agent's internal and external structure in both decades and concluded that the macro-environment as an influencing factor had changed more than the individual-agent. Part Three examines the lives of camorristi in the 1950 s and 1980 s in order to determine how far their criminal practice has been transformed. Part Four investigates the wider picture of system-interaction between the Camorra's social subsystem and the political system. Focussing on the relationship between camorristi and the political elite in the 1950 s and 1980 s we highlight the radical changes that occurred. This thesis presents a theoretical discussion of how to study organised crime and social behaviour in general and at the same time a detailed empirical study, in particular of the political role of a criminal organisation in <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>historical</b> <b>situation,</b> that of Naples over the last forty years.

5000|$|In {{his famous}} book State {{capitalism}} in Russia (1948), Tony Cliff theorized {{that the law}} of value [...] "tends to equalise supply and demand, {{a situation in which}} price is equal to value, or more correctly, is equal to price of production." [...] Although there seemed to him to be little internal evidence that the law of value regulated the Soviet economy, he believed the law of value was [...] "the arbiter of the Russian economic structure as soon as it is seen in the <b>concrete</b> <b>historical</b> <b>situation</b> of today—the anarchic world market." [...] Critics of this interpretation argue that the Soviet economy was, in reality, rather autarkic (self-sufficient), that foreign trade was state-directed and played a comparatively small role in the economy as a whole, and that the foreign transactions were often non-commercial (often a form of barter, subsidized transfers or counter-trade).|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a critical review}} of recent literature which has attempted to define what a ‘failed state’ is and explain why such states emerge. It is argued that aggregate indices of ‘failure’ are misleading due to the wide variations of capacity across state functions within a polity. The focus on ranking states also distracts attention away from analyses concerning the dynamics of state capacity. Moreover, many of the definitions either compare reality to a Weberian ideal, or assume that violence is ‘development in reverse’, {{both of which are}} ahistorical and unhelpful as a guide to policy. The second part of the paper assesses the contributions of functionalist, ‘new war’, and neo-Tillean approaches to explaining state failure.

This special issue seeks to interrogate what analytical value an explicit engagement with the emerging field of the “History of Emotions” can bring to explorations of law and emotions. In this Introduction, I suggest that working with a more methodologically reflexive understanding of emotions, and how they can be analyzed in <b>concrete</b> <b>historical</b> <b>situations,</b> can deepen our understanding—and complicate chronologies of change—regarding the interrelationship between law and emotions. We need to understand emotions not just as inchoate feelings but as bodily practices that are culturally and historically situated. Moreover, in order to historicize emotions, we also need to historicize the psychological, physical, and material context in which a person experiences her emotions: that is, we need historically contingent notions of the self, body, and the material performance of corporeality...|$|R

It shows that the rhetorical figure 'Nordic democracy' was a product of the age of totalitarianism and the Cold War. It explores the ways in which 'Nordic democracy' was used, mainly by the social democrats, to provide the welfare politics with cultural and historical legitimacy and foundations. Thus, it also acknowledges the ideological and geopolitical context in which the 'Nordic welfare state' was conceptualised and canonised.

The cossack society is gradually transformed into peasant communities with their focus on agriculture. However, the development of economic occupations was hampered by maintaining a long military service, which in new terms came to be regarded by the cossacks as a hindrance to normal life. The level of development of agriculture was constrained by low agro-technical culture and preservation, and routine equipment. ...|$|R

The particular {{strengths and weaknesses of}} different economic forces and structures inherent in any <b>concrete</b> <b>historical</b> <b>situation</b> and the trajectories which economic actors will pursue cannot be deduced from universal objective formulas derived from “best practice”. This paper posits that the perspective and possible trajectory of action of specific urban elites will have a powerful, if not determining interest, on the course of urban development. Development has in fact been theoretically linked with elite theory since the heyday of modernisation ideology when it was assumed that suitably committed elites would be the agents of modernisation in backward countries once they had had their reckoning with traditional elites. 2 In less theoretical writing, independence for the colonies was assumed to be driven and directed by elites who would hopefully be the key social, political and economic transformers. 3 This perspective seems naïve and somewhat circular today but we feel that a return to the question of elites may be a necessary exercise; the concept is far from passé. Why elites? The case study we are examining, that of the large South African port city of Durban, clearly operates as a nexus of capitalist activity.

But, in this crucial regard at least, so too have its authors. In adopting rather than fully historicizing the rise and expansion of social theories, works of ‘historical social science’ obscure rather than illuminate the historical and political origins of social forms of governance and thought; underestimate their significance for the history of international theory; and are unable to identify the more fundamental governance form of which the rise of the modern social realm is <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>historical</b> expression...|$|R

Further, this paper suggests that this limited view severely narrows the understanding of organizational “success. ” Research limitations/implications – While this research serves to problematize notions of accountability further, it leaves the task of developing alternative practices to future researchers. Originality/value – This paper contributes in two ways: first, there is a paucity of research linking pragmatism to the actual workings of concrete organizations. This paper begins to fill that gap.

40|$|Joseph Selling, {{professor}} emeritus from KU Leuven, Belgium, recently {{made a significant}} contribution towards ethical methodology. It {{is in fact a}} continuation of the in-house conversations that have been in vogue about methods in moral reasoning since Vatican II in the discipline called theological ethics. What is specific about Selling’s attempt is that he re-orients or reframes the evaluation of the moral event to consider human intentionality or motivation before considering human behavior or human acts. He convincingly establishes his method by a meticulous reading of Thomas Aquinas. This paper is a response to the goal-oriented ethics that he has posited. As illustrated below, this paper evaluates the goal-oriented approach as solid and sufficient. While fully endorsing this approach, this paper argues that the process of ethical goal-setting is to be framed concretely. In <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>historical</b> context, so that a goal-oriented approach fully serves its purpose, this paper proposes that it is to be reinforced by four supportive pillars, which are in fact assumed by Selling in his work. They are openness to human sciences, conversation among various narratives, positing a theological frame for ethical reasoning, and recourse to non-discursive reasoning...|$|R
40|$|The Jesus of Nazareth {{who came}} forward {{publicly}} as the Messiah, who preached the ethic of the Kingdom of God, {{who founded the}} Kingdom of Heaven upon earth, and died to give it its final consecration, never had any existence. He is a figure designed by rationalism, endowed with life by liberalism and clothed by modern theology in a historical garb (p. 398). For Schweitzer, “Jesus means something to our world because a mighty spiritual force streams forth from Him and flows through our time also. This fact can neither be shaken nor confirmed by any historical discovery ” (p. 399). In this view of Christianity as spirituality rather than history, “ … the truth is, it is not Jesus as historically known, but Jesus as spiritually arisen within men, who is significant for our time and can help it ” (p. 401). Whereas Schweitzer was writing a century ago, a host of contemporary scholars (Harpur, 2004) have come to share his conclusion that “Jesus as <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>historical</b> personality remains <b>a</b> stranger to our time, but His spirit, Page 2 of 18 passio...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{description}} and analysis of C. A. Eschenmayer’s philosophy of faith and of his discussion with F. W. J. Schelling. The author exposes the main ideas of Eschenmayer’s important work «Philosophy In Its Transition To The Non-Philosophy» (1803) in which he criticizes Schelling’s philosophy of the absolute identity pointing out the vagueness of the origin of multitude from the all-unity. At the material of Schelling’s answer («Philosophy and Religion», 1804) the author shows how Schelling begins to change his theoretical point of view. The world now is falling away from God. The paper deals also with their discussion of 1810 – 1812 around Schelling’s philosophy of liberty. Here Eschenmayer’s theology becomes completely apophatic. Owing to his incomprehension of the Schelling’s thought of those times and to his ﬁ deism, his contradictions with Schelling become irreconciliable. But the both philosophers maintain friendly relations, it isn’t a case of Jacobi-Schelling controversy. Conclusions that may be drawn from the paper are following: (1) the philosophy of Eschenmayer is a particular case of the philosophy of feeling and faith which has <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>historical</b> nature. (2) The late «positive» Schelling’s philosophy can be considered as a successful «third way» between the unsteady rationalism and the theoretical deadlock of ﬁ deism...|$|R
5000|$|His final major work Das Politische und der Mensch (The Political and Man) {{remained}} unfinished at {{the time}} of his death, but nevertheless managed to present a unified social-scientific theory or [...] "value-free" [...] description of social phenomena, encompassing socio-ontological, sociological and historical aspects of the study of human affairs. Kondylis's conception of social ontology does not offer any fixed causalities or laws nor does it say what people ought to do or not do in any given situation or how their social action should unfold. The task of social ontology is accordingly not to reduce fluid and varied phenomena to basic samples and basic genetic factors; what is sought is to show the spectrum of the forces and factors, which can only be constituted and become discernible from the - irreducible and inexhaustible - diversity of form. Such forces and factors, of course, include certain constants such as striving for self-preservation through the expanding of one's own power, and the friend-foe relation, which exist in all societies and are actualised in <b>concrete</b> <b>historical</b> <b>situations</b> and therefore have concrete dimension and content e.g. when the dominant paradigm might be theocentrism or anthropocentrism or mass democratic post-Modernity. Much of the nearly completed first volume (three volumes had been planned by Kondylis) is an analysis of mass-democratic ideology in the social sciences while also dealing with methodological and theoretical questions such as the distinction between [...] "socio-ontic observation" [...] and [...] "socio-historical observation" [...] and the three key aspects of the social: the social relation, the political and man. Moreover, Kondylis examines the social relation as regards its [...] "internal" [...] mechanism of subjectivity and [...] "external" [...] mechanism of action, the friend-foe polarity and the social relation's continuity, in addition to exploring the concepts of understanding and rationality by way of an extensive examination and/or critique of numerous renowned authors such as Buber, Durkheim, Dilthey, Habermas, Heidegger, Husserl, Luhmann, Mead, Schütz, Parsons, Popper, Simmel, Tönnies, Weber and von Wiese.|$|R
40|$|Traditional studies {{conclude}} that Shandao's Pure Land Buddhism {{is characterized by}} its affiliation with State Buddhism (National Buddhism). When we analyze the text "Fa-shi-zan" in detail, however, another conclusion inevitably follows from our analysis. In the "Fa-shi-zan" (T 47, p. 483 a), Shandao prays for the happiness of the Crown Prince {{and women in the}} seraglio. In prior research, it has been understood that this prayer is a sign of his affiliation with National Buddhism. However, it is possible to understand that his same words are quite different when the imperial household's concrete situation at that time is taken into consideration. Shandao was a priest who had interaction with the people. In this paper, I pay special attention to the postscript where the people's understanding of Buddhism at that time is frankly shown. I analyze three hand-copied sutra's postscripts excavated in Dunhuang that refer to the Empress, and we can see that it is limited that the empress's name is seen in the postscript {{at a time when the}} Empress had great authority. In a word, it is limited that the Empress is referred to in the postscript in the age when the Empress had great authority. When thinking of the period when Shandao lived, for the imperial household at that time, they were suffering from Zetianwuhou's tyranny. Considering this <b>historical</b> <b>situation,</b> Shandao's words in the text of "Fa-shi-zan" should not be read as characterizing State Buddhism but should be read as showing his remonstrance for Zetianwuhou. Moreover, by examining the change in the number of buddhist images at the Longmen caves, it is possible to understand a new and different aspect of Shandao. His participation in the construction of the great image of the Buddha at Fengxiansi temple has been understood as being part of his affiliation with National Buddhism; however, when the increase in the number of production of Amitabha Buddha images in Longmen is taken into consideration, it can be understood that his participation is part of the prosperity of the belief in Amitabha Buddha there. His participation can be understood not as being nationalistic, but due to the Amitabha Buddha belief of the people who were connected to the Longmen caves. As mentioned above, when Shandao's so-called side "National Buddhism" is reviewed in the <b>concrete</b> <b>historical</b> <b>situation</b> in which he lived, we can understood that the former analysis of him being nationalistic is inaccurate...|$|R
