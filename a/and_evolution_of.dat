5|$|A major {{development}} {{in recent decades}} has been {{the study of the}} formation, structure, <b>and</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> scientific communities by sociologists and anthropologists - including David Bloor, Harry Collins, Bruno Latour, and Anselm Strauss. Concepts and methods (such as rational choice, social choice or game theory) from economics have also been applied for understanding the efficiency of scientific communities in the production of knowledge. This interdisciplinary field {{has come to be known}} as science and technology studies.|$|E
5|$|Astronomy and {{astrophysics}} {{have developed}} significant interdisciplinary links with other major scientific fields. Archaeoastronomy {{is the study}} of ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context, utilizing archaeological and anthropological evidence. Astrobiology {{is the study of}} the advent <b>and</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> biological systems in the Universe, with particular emphasis on the possibility of non-terrestrial life. Astrostatistics is the application of statistics to astrophysics to the analysis of vast amount of observational astrophysical data.|$|E

5|$|Individual {{nations are}} {{beginning}} to note the effect of fishing on seamounts, and the European Commission has agreed to fund the OASIS project, a detailed study {{of the effects of}} fishing on seamount communities in the North Atlantic. Another project working towards conservation is CenSeam, a Census of Marine Life project formed in 2005. CenSeam is intended to provide the framework needed to prioritise, integrate, expand and facilitate seamount research efforts in order to significantly reduce the unknown and build towards a global understanding of seamount ecosystems, and the roles they have in the biogeography, biodiversity, productivity <b>and</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> marine organisms.|$|E
5|$|Microbiology {{was largely}} ignored by early {{evolutionary}} theory. This {{was due to}} the paucity of morphological traits and the lack of a species concept in microbiology, particularly amongst prokaryotes. Now, evolutionary researchers are taking advantage of their improved understanding of microbial physiology and ecology, produced by the comparative ease of microbial genomics, to explore the taxonomy <b>and</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> these organisms. These studies are revealing unanticipated levels of diversity amongst microbes.|$|E
5|$|Observational {{astronomy}} uses lensing {{effects as}} an important tool to infer properties of the lensing object. Even in cases where that object is not directly visible, {{the shape of a}} lensed image provides information about the mass distribution responsible for the light deflection. In particular, gravitational lensing provides one way to measure the distribution of dark matter, which does not give off light and can be observed only by its gravitational effects. One particularly interesting application are large-scale observations, where the lensing masses are spread out over a significant fraction of the observable universe, and can be used to obtain information about the large-scale properties <b>and</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> our cosmos.|$|E

5|$|Observations of the {{large-scale}} {{structure of the}} Universe, a branch known as physical cosmology, have provided a deep understanding of the formation <b>and</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> the cosmos. Fundamental to modern cosmology is the well-accepted theory of the big bang, wherein our Universe began at a single point in time, and thereafter expanded {{over the course of}} 13.8 billion years to its present condition. The concept of the big bang {{can be traced back to}} the discovery of the microwave background radiation in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Paleontology {{also has}} some overlap with archaeology, which {{primarily}} works with objects made by humans and with human remains, while paleontologists {{are interested in the}} characteristics <b>and</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> humans as organisms. When dealing with evidence about humans, archaeologists and paleontologists may work together– for example paleontologists might identify animal or plant fossils around an archaeological site, to discover what the people who lived there ate; or they might analyze the climate at the time when the site was inhabited by humans.|$|E
5|$|Planetary {{science is}} the study of the {{assemblage}} of planets, moons, dwarf planets, comets, asteroids, and other bodies orbiting the Sun, as well as extrasolar planets. The Solar System has been relatively well-studied, initially through telescopes and then later by spacecraft. This has provided a good overall understanding of the formation <b>and</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> this planetary system, although many new discoveries are still being made.|$|E

5|$|The 1950s and 1960s saw two {{developments}} {{that would affect}} stellar convection theory in red supergiants: the Stratoscope projects and the 1958 publication of Structure <b>and</b> <b>Evolution</b> <b>of</b> the Stars, principally the work of Martin Schwarzschild and his colleague at Princeton University, Richard Härm. This book disseminated {{ideas on how to}} apply computer technologies to create stellar models, while the Stratoscope projects, by taking balloon-borne telescopes above the Earth's turbulence, produced some of the finest images of solar granules and sunspots ever seen, thus confirming the existence of convection in the solar atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The Sun's {{magnetic}} field leads to many effects that are collectively called solar activity. Solar flares and coronal-mass ejections tend to occur at sunspot groups. Slowly changing high-speed streams of solar wind are emitted from coronal holes at the photospheric surface. Both coronal-mass ejections and high-speed streams of solar wind carry plasma and interplanetary {{magnetic field}} outward into the Solar System. The effects of solar activity on Earth include auroras at moderate to high latitudes and {{the disruption of}} radio communications and electric power. Solar activity {{is thought to have}} played a large role in the formation <b>and</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} <b>and</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> medieval warships is {{a matter}} of debate and conjecture: until recently, no remains of an oared warship from either ancient or early medieval times had been found, and information had to be gathered by analyzing literary evidence, crude artistic depictions and the remains of a few merchant vessels. Only in 2005–2006 did archaeological digs for the Marmaray project in the location of the Harbour of Theodosius (modern Yenikapi) uncover the remains of over 36 Byzantine ships from the 6th to 10th centuries, including four light galleys of the galea type.|$|E

5|$|The {{claims have}} been criticized for {{ignoring}} that the second law only applies to isolated systems. Organisms are open systems as they constantly exchange energy and matter with their environment: for example animals eat food and excrete waste, and radiate and absorb heat. It is argued that the Sun-Earth-space system does not violate the second law because the enormous increase in entropy due to the Sun and Earth radiating into space dwarfs the local decrease in entropy caused by the existence <b>and</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> self-organizing life.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} <b>and</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> the Solar System began 4.6billion {{years ago}} with the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud.

In Oceania, circumcision is practiced by the Australian Aborigines and Polynesians. There is also evidence that circumcision was practiced among the Aztec and Mayan civilizations in the Americas, but little detail is available about its history.|$|E
