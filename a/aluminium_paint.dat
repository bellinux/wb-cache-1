5000|$|Panel edge {{staining}} is {{a naturally}} occurring problem that occurs to anodized aluminium {{and stainless steel}} paneling and facades. It is semi-permanent staining that dulls the panel or facades surface (in particular {{the edges of the}} paneling), reducing the natural luster and shine produced by the anodizing processes used on the aluminium. Panel edge staining may also appear on powder coated <b>aluminium,</b> <b>painted</b> <b>aluminium,</b> stainless steel and titanium surfaces.|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{metallic}} components rely on properties that {{are specific to}} the alloy and its surface. Coatings have been extensively used to protect metallic surfaces from the aggressive effects of the environment {{to which it is}} exposed. In this investigation, the high temperature oxidation behavior of a FeCr and a FeCrY alloy coated with an <b>aluminium</b> based <b>paint</b> has been studied. The objective was to form the more resistant alumina surface layer on an aluminium free alloy. <b>Aluminium</b> based <b>paint</b> coated and uncoated specimens of the two alloys were oxidized for up to 200 hours at 1000 °C in air. The oxidized specimens were examined in a scanning electron microscope coupled to an energy dispersive system and the surfaces were analyzed by X ray diffraction analysis. The <b>aluminium</b> based <b>paint</b> coating increased the oxidation resistance of the alloys, mainly over extended periods. The FeCrY alloy coated with the Al based paint exhibited the highest oxidation resistance...|$|R

50|$|Some {{projection}} screens have an aluminized surface, usually an <b>aluminium</b> <b>paint</b> {{rather than a}} solid sheet of the metal. They reflect polarized light without altering its polarization. This is necessary when showing 3D films as left-eye and right-eye views which are superimposed but oppositely polarized (typically at opposite 45 degree angles to the vertical if linearly polarized, right-handed and left-handed if circularly polarized).

40|$|Abstract Aluminium {{generally}} presents good {{corrosion resistance}} to the atmosphere. However, unprotected aluminium and aluminium alloys weather outdoors to an ugly grey colour, which deepens to black in industrial atmospheres, and undergo superficial pitting in marine atmospheres, etc. Finishing technologies are applied for their protection and decoration {{in a wide range}} of applications. These technologies basically consist of two protection processes: anodizing and painting; the latter going from conventional solvent base paints to modem water-borne, high solids and powder coatings. This paper considers the weathering performance of three paint systems: alkyd, polyurethane and polyester, after more than three years of exposure in a wide spectra of Ibero-American atmospheric conditions. The information reported includes resistance to undercutting corrosion at the scribe, filiform corrosion, fungal attack and change in the physical-chemical properties of the paint surface (loss of gloss, colour changes, chalking, etc.).
