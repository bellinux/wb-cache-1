40|$|Low ductile crack <b>arrestability</b> in a {{full-scale}} burst test of 1420 mm-diameter X 80 steel line pipes {{was accompanied by}} a high intensity of fracture surface separation. The texture of the steel plates was studied using different techniques in order to evaluate the influence of { 001 } planes oriented parallel to the rolling plane on the separation intensity during fracture. Though no clear correlation between the content of { 001 } planes parallel to the rolling plane and intensity of separation was found, the local distribution of the { 001 } texture component among the microstructure components was different in different steels providing long areas suitable for cleavage fracture parallel to the rolling plane in steel with low <b>arrestability...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Brittle crack <b>arrestability</b> is {{extremely}} important in welded joints of heavy gauge steel plates used in large container ships. Recently, much attention {{has been focused on}} potential crack propagation along welds using large heat input. This paper examines the application of a T-joint to the strength deck structure of container ships to enhance crack <b>arrestability.</b> The crack arrest toughness, Kca, for crack arrest was varied. The ESSO test of T-joint components showed that brittle crack was arrested at the T-joint if the steel plate used for the flange had a high Kca value in the range from 4900 to 7300 N/mm 3 / 2. FE-analysis of the stress intensity factor K indicated that brittle crack propagation was arrested under the condition that the K-value at the running crack tip was less than the Kca of the material. In the T-joint, it was noted that the K-value around the area of the deepest point of the crack decreased and was finally less than the Kca of the flange plate when the brittle crack penetrated suddenly into the flange plate to a 10 mm depth. This phenomenon shows the advantage of using a T-joint for brittle crack arrest in the flange plates of strength deck structures...|$|E
40|$|Crack {{arrest of}} fast running cracks is an {{important}} issue for the safety of steel structures. Crack arrest design can prevent fatal damage of large structures by restricting the influence of the incidents. Therefore crack arrest design is important especially for very large structure, where accidents may cause huge economical and social losses. Propagating shear fracture, long running ductile crack propagation in pipelines and brittle crack propagation in heavy thick shipbuilding steels have been investigated. For the propagating shear fracture issue, a new HLP simulation model, applicable to various backfill conditions, including underwater backfill, was developed. The proposed backfill model {{can be applied to the}} prediction of the crack arrest of propagating shear fracture under various backfill conditions. The new HLP simulation was successful in estimating full-scale burst tests with various backfill depths. The new HLP simulation for underwater pipelines indicated that propagating shear cracks are easily arrested in offshore pipelines compared to onshore pipeline. The toughness requirement of the line pipe for preventing propagating shear fracture can be significantly smaller in underwater pipelines compared to onshore pipelines. The margin of the underwater pipeline for propagating shear fracture was clarified by the new model developed in this thesis. For brittle crack arrest, an empirical approach for long crack propagation has been conducted. Several large-scale crack arrest tests were carried out in order to investigate the long crack <b>arrestability</b> of heavy-thick shipbuilding steel plates. All plates and their welded joints used in this study satisfied the Charpy toughness requirement for EH-grade shipbuilding steels and welded joints. A brittle crack ran along a welded joint and penetrated through the test plate under a stress exceeding 200 MPa, despite the presence of longitudinal stiffeners across the test weld. A brittle crack in a base plate model test with longitudinal stiffeners propagated through the specimen under the maximum design stress. These results suggest that EH-grade cannot ensure <b>arrestability</b> even in the base plate, in case of heavy thick shipbuilding steel. Two crack arrest tests were conducted in order to demonstrate the possibility of long crack arrest using high <b>arrestability</b> steels. The test results indicated that the crack arrest concept could be achieved by a combination of high arrest toughness materials and a special fabrication method which can derive a brittle crack into the base plate of high <b>arrestability</b> plate. The crack arrest design can be used in practice even for large-scale structures using heavy thick steel plates. The effective K concept, as proposed by Machida, et al. 31), provides the boundary of the “arrest” and “propagate” data in the large-scale tests conducted in this work. The effective K concept was found to be valid even for long crack propagation of such a heavy thick steel plate as investigated in this paper.

40|$|AbstractPrevention of {{brittle crack}} {{propagation}} {{as well as}} crack initiation is essential as “double integrity”. The application of steels with high <b>arrestability</b> to the structures is directly effective to ensure the integrity. Although it is empirically known microstructures have a possibility to macroscopically enhance the <b>arrestability</b> of steel, there are not any theories which have quantitatively explained the relationship between brittle fracture and microstructures in the past investigations. In the present study, we propose a multiscale fracture mechanics model by a “model synthesis” approach, which integrates the multiple models and analyses to systematically evaluate complicated macroscopic and microscopic phenomena, {{based on the information}} of microstructures of the steel. The model is composed of (i) microscopic model to simulate cleavage fracture in grain scale (10 - 6 ~ 10 - 3 m), and (ii) macroscopic model to simulate brittle fracture in steel plate scale (10 - 3 ~ 10 °m). As validation, the proposed model is applied to temperature gradient crack arrest test of steel plate having nonhomogeneous distributions of microstructures in thickness direction. The prediction results show good agreement with experimental results in both crack arrest length and shape of crack front. That is, the proposed model has a potential basis of the framework to establish the theory to clarify the relationship between microstructures and brittle crack propagation and arrest behavior...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo prevent brittle cracks from causing fatal {{damage to}} steel structures, {{it is needed}} that steels have enough crack <b>arrestability.</b> However, the brittle crack propagation/arrest {{behavior}} has not been explained theoretically enough from the aspect of energy balance and especially the long crack problem has remained as an important unsolved issue for some decades. The authors propose a new model based on local fracture stress criterion to solve the long crack problem. The model considers crack closure effect by uncracked side ligaments formed due to relaxation of plastic constraint progressing with SIF increasing. A simultaneous equation composed of four equations, which formulate local fracture condition, strain hardening, yield point, and dynamic SIF considering side ligaments, is solved to simulate a crack propagation in the model. To validate the model, we compared model simulations with some experiments. Some of them were conducted under the long crack problem condition and obtained the result that they showed good agreements, even under the long crack problem condition. This implies the long crack problem can be explained from the aspect of side ligament development due to the relaxation of plastic constraint...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand of}} natural gas has been increasing. To meet the growing demand {{of natural gas}}, new gas fields must be developed. The {{transportation}} cost of gas to market {{is an important factor}} for the development of new gas fields, which are located in remote area. High-pressure gas pipelines by high strength steel pipes have been focused to find the solution of it. API grade X 100 and X 120 line pipes for high-pressure gas pipeline have been successfully developed and the application technologies have been studied to construct safe and economical pipelines. High quality steel and TMCP (Thermo-Mechanical Control Process) technology in plate rolling made it possible to achieve high strength and high toughness of X 100 or X 120 grade large diameter line pipes. Optimum steel chemistry for high strength and high toughness has been selected to maintain good weldability. Lower cooling finishing temperature has been applied to get higher strength. Pipes produced by UOE process were proved to meet X 100 or X 120 grade high strength line pipes for high-pressure operation. One of the key issues for the application of these high strength line pipes is the <b>arrestability</b> of propagating ductile fracture in high-pressure gas pipelines. A series of full scale burst tests were conducted to evaluate the arrest energy for high strength line pipes. It was reported that the prediction of arrest energ...|$|E
