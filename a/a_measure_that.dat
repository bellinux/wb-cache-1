5|$|In 2009, Mayor Cheye Calvo {{proposed}} <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> {{would require}} every Maryland police department that operates a SWAT team to submit biannual reports on its activities, including {{where and when}} it was deployed and whether an operation resulted in arrests, evidence seizures, or injuries. The bill passed that same year, despite strong opposition from Maryland's police agencies. Maryland was the first state to adopt such legislation; Utah became the second when it passed a similar bill in March 2014.|$|E
5|$|Odell Waller (1917 – July 2, 1942) was an African American {{sharecropper}} from Gretna, Virginia {{executed for}} the fatal shooting {{of his white}} landlord, Oscar Wheldon Davis, on July 15, 1940. Waller unsuccessfully maintained at his trial that the killing had been in self-defense, but was convicted of a jury of white citizens who had paid the poll tax, <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> effectively barred blacks and poor whites from jury service.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{many groups}} have {{attempted}} to lower age of candidacy requirements in various states. In 1994, South Dakota voters rejected <b>a</b> ballot <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> would have lowered the age requirements {{to serve as a}} State Senator or State Representative from 25 to 18. In 1998, however, they approved <b>a</b> similar ballot <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> reduced the age requirements for those offices from 25 to 21. In 2002, Oregon voters rejected <b>a</b> ballot <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> would have reduced the age requirement to serve as a State Representative from 21 to 18.|$|R

The party would also abandon catch quotas set by the EU's Common Fisheries Policy and establish 'no fishing zones' to ensure plentiful stocks.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{oversaw the}} {{transition}} of the University of Louisville from municipal to state funding. He pushed for reforms to the state's education system, giving up his own chairmanship of the University of Kentucky board of trustees and extending voting rights to student and faculty members of university boards. These changes generally shifted administration positions in the state's colleges from political rewards to professional appointments. He increased funding to the state's education budget and gave expanded powers to the Council on Higher Education. He vetoed <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> would have allowed collective bargaining for teachers.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, NY93 was realigned to use Junction and Upper Mountain Roads instead. As a result, NY270 was {{cut back to}} its {{junction}} with Upper Mountain Road. On November1, 2005, the Niagara County Legislature voted on <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>that,</b> if passed, would allow the county to ask the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to remove the NY93 designation from Upper Mountain Road, a county-maintained highway, and reassign it to Junction Road (NY270) and Saunders Settlement Road (NY31). The change was intended to eliminate truck traffic on Upper Mountain Road while providing additional capacity to NY93. This part of the agenda was passed. NYSDOT obliged to the request in 2006, rerouting NY93 as proposed and truncating NY270 southward to NY31.|$|E

President Lincoln signed the amendment into law on July 17. Wilson's law paid African Americans in the military $10 monthly, which was effectively $7 a month after deductions for food and clothing, while white soldiers were paid effectively $14 monthly.|$|E
5|$|Realising {{that they}} were being {{monitored}} by the Bavarian police, Lenin and the newspaper's other editors agreed to relocate Iskra to London, Britain, with Lenin and his wife arriving in the city in April 1902, there renting a flat in St. Pancras. Although despising English cuisine, Lenin liked London, spending much time in the Reading Room of the British Museum. He lived in close proximity to the other editors, but disliked their communal mode of living, instead becoming good friends with Trotsky, who had arrived in the city. While in London, Lenin fell ill with erysipelas and was unable to take such a leading role on the Iskra editorial board; in his absence the board approved <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> he disagreed with, that of moving back to Switzerland. Before relocating, Lenin holidayed in Brittany, France with his mother and sister.|$|E

5|$|In August 1816 Jennings {{was elected}} {{to serve as the}} first {{governor}} of Indiana at age 32, and re-elected for an additional term. He pressed for the construction of roads and schools, and negotiated the Treaty of St. Mary's to open up central Indiana to American settlement. His opponents attacked his participation in the treaty negotiations as unconstitutional and brought impeachment proceedings against him, <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> was narrowly defeated by a vote of 15 to 13 after a month-long investigation and the resignation of the lieutenant governor. During his second term and following the panic of 1819, Jennings encountered financial problems, a situation exacerbated by his inability to keep up with his business interests and run the state government simultaneously. Ineligible for another term as Indiana governor under the state constitution, Jennings looked for other means of financial support. Shortly before completion of his second term as governor in 1822, Jennings {{was elected to}} the U.S. House of Representatives, before retiring from public service in 1831. In Congress Jennings promoted federal spending on internal improvements.|$|E
5|$|Lord Guildford Dudley (also spelt Guilford) (c.1535 – 12 February 1554) was {{the husband}} of Lady Jane Grey who, {{declared}} as his heir by King Edward VI, occupied the English throne from 10July until 19July 1553. Guildford Dudley enjoyed a humanist education and was married to Jane in a magnificent celebration about six weeks before the King's death. After Guildford's father, the Duke of Northumberland, had engineered Jane's accession, Jane and Guildford spent her brief rule residing in the Tower of London. They {{were still in the}} Tower when their regime collapsed and they remained there, in different quarters, as prisoners. They were condemned to death for high treason in November 1553. Queen Mary I was inclined to spare their lives, but Thomas Wyatt's rebellion against her plans to marry Philip of Spain led to the young couple's execution, <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> was widely seen as unduly harsh.|$|E
