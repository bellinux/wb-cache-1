40|$|Abstract. We {{work out}} {{properties}} of smooth projective varieties X over a (not necessarily algebraically closed) field k that admit collections {{of objects in}} the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves Db(X) that are either full exceptional, or numerically exceptional of maximal length. Our main result gives a necessary and sufficient condition on the Néron– Severi lattice for a smooth projective surface S with χ(OS) = 1 to admit <b>a</b> numerically <b>exceptional</b> collection of maximal length. As a consequence we determine exactly which complex surfaces with pg = q = 0 admit <b>a</b> numerically <b>exceptional</b> collection of maximal length. Another consequence is that a geometrically rational surface with <b>a</b> numerically <b>exceptional</b> collection of maximal length is rational...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of his writing, {{at the time of his}} death Wallace had been for many years a {{well-known}} figure both as a scientist and as a social activist. He was often sought out by journalists and others for his views on a variety of topics. He received honorary doctorates and a number of professional honours, such the Royal Society's Royal Medal and Darwin Medal in 1868 and 1890 respectively, and the Order of Merit in 1908. Above all, his role as the co-discoverer of natural selection and his work on zoogeography marked him out as <b>an</b> <b>exceptional</b> figure.|$|E
5|$|Bonds was {{regarded}} as <b>an</b> <b>exceptional</b> hitter: he led MLB in on-base plus slugging six times, and placed within the top five hitters in 12 of his 17 qualifying seasons. He holds many MLB hitting records, including most career home runs, most home runs in a single season (73, set in 2001) and most career walks. He also received eight Gold Gloves for his defense in the outfield. He is ranked second in career Wins Above Replacement among all major league position players by both Fangraphs and Baseball-Reference.com, behind only Babe Ruth.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, {{another study}} was {{published}} describing the integument and dermis of Psittacosaurus sp., {{from two different}} specimens. The skin remains could be observed by a natural cross-section to compare them to modern animals, showing that dinosaurian dermal layers evolved in parallel to those in many other large vertebrates. The collagen tissue fibres in Psittacosaurus are complex, virtually identical to all other vertebrates in structure but having <b>an</b> <b>exceptional</b> thickness of about forty layers. As the sections of dermis were collected from the abdomen, where the scales were eroded, the tissue may have assisted with the musculature of the stomach and intestines and offered protection against predators.|$|E
