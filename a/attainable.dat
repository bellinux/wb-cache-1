5|$|Defining {{the top end}} of a clarinet's {{range is}} difficult, since many {{advanced}} players can produce notes well above the highest notes commonly found in method books. G6 is usually the highest note clarinetists encounter in classical repertoire. The C above that (C7 i.e. resting on the fifth ledger line above the treble staff) is <b>attainable</b> by advanced players and is shown on many fingering charts, and fingerings as high as A7 exist.|$|E
5|$|Like most rare-earth elements, {{praseodymium}} most readily {{forms the}} +3 oxidation state, {{which is the}} only stable state in aqueous solution, although the +4 oxidation state is known in some solid compounds and, uniquely among the lanthanides, the +5 oxidation state is <b>attainable</b> in matrix-isolation conditions. Aqueous praseodymium ions are yellowish-green, and similarly praseodymium results in various shades of yellow-green when incorporated into glasses. Many of praseodymium's industrial uses involve its ability to filter yellow light from light sources.|$|E
5|$|Many {{methods of}} {{decreasing}} the response time of ALFs have been developed. Even {{in the late}} 1980s, certain gases were used to catalyze the decay of the electrons of the vapor cell. In 1989, Eric Korevaar had developed his Fast ALF design which detected emitted fluorescence without photosensitive plates. With such methods employed, gigahertz frequencies are easily <b>attainable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} June 2008 Virginia Democratic primary, Moran {{endorsed}} Senator Barack Obama of Illinois {{for the presidency}} over New York Senator and former First Lady Hillary Clinton. Explaining his endorsement, he told a local newspaper that the long-term goal of closing Alexandria's coal-fired power plant would be more <b>attainable</b> under Obama than under Clinton. Obama won the Virginia primary, and carried the state {{when he won the}} general election in November.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} {{of carbon dioxide}} on the surface suggests that Titania may have a tenuous seasonal atmosphere of CO2, much {{like that of the}} Jovian moon Callisto. Other gases, like nitrogen or methane, are unlikely to be present, because Titania's weak gravity could not prevent them from escaping into space. At the maximum temperature <b>attainable</b> during Titania's summer solstice (89 K), the vapor pressure of carbon dioxide is about 300 μPa (3 nbar).|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{succumbed to}} a 4–1 defeat in their opening match against Spartak Moscow, {{which was the}} biggest loss inflicted on the club in 18 years. The team let slip a two-goal lead against Bayern Munich at Highbury on 5 December 2000, before winning 1–0 at Olympique Lyonnais to keep their {{aspirations}} of qualifying for the quarter-finals <b>attainable.</b> In the reverse fixture, an equaliser scored by Edmílson in the last minute of normal time prompted Wenger to rue fatigue {{and the absence of}} captain Adams. Arsenal defeated Spartak Moscow by a solitary goal and in spite of losing to Bayern Munich on 14 March 2001, Lyon's draw with Spartak Moscow meant Arsenal qualified for the quarter-finals by the head-to-head rule.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the game}} begins, the player character's {{parachute}} fails to open. Awakening hours later, the character finds almost all his equipment inoperable. Reaching the pyramid on foot {{hours after the}} rest of the team entered the structure, the player must complete the team's mission before the god awakens in five days. In the pyramid, the player finds bodies of squad-mates, the remains of Spanish-speaking treasure hunters, and fallen members of a Nazi expedition from the 1930s who were looking for a secret weapon but never returned. Additional plot elements can be revealed by speaking to these dead, enabled by an item <b>attainable</b> early in the game, the yellow crystal.|$|E
5|$|Field marshal is the five-star {{rank and}} highest <b>attainable</b> {{rank in the}} Indian Army. Though the rank is placed above general, it is not {{observed}} in the regular structure. It is a largely ceremonial or wartime rank, having been awarded only twice. A field marshal receives the full pay of a four–star general, and is considered a serving officer until their death. They wear a full uniform on all ceremonial occasions. In addition to this, they also run {{an office in the}} Army Headquarters with a secretariat.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher G. H. R. Parkinson notes {{a common}} {{objection}} to Kant's argument: that {{what ought to}} be done does not necessarily entail that it is possible. He also argues that alternative conceptions of morality exist which do not rely on the assumptions that Kant makes – he cites utilitarianism as an example which does not require the summum bonum. Nicholas Everitt argues that much moral guidance is unattainable, such as the Biblical command to be Christ-like. He proposes that Kant's first two premises only entail that we must try to achieve the perfect good, not that it is actually <b>attainable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Any {{point that}} lies {{either on the}} {{production}} possibilities curve or {{to the left of}} it is said to be an <b>attainable</b> point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Points that lie {{to the right of the}} production possibilities curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly to the left of the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, McCaw was {{selected}} in the New Zealand under-19 squad (coached by Mark Shaw), which won the world championship in Wales. During that series, McCaw realised his All Blacks dream could be <b>attainable.</b> The following year he {{was selected}} in the New Zealand under-21 squad and debuted for Canterbury in the National Provincial Championship (NPC) against North Harbour. On 31 March 2001, he made his Super Rugby debut with the Crusaders, playing a few minutes in a losing effort against the Hurricanes. That year he only played twice for the Crusaders, both times as a substitute, {{for a total of}} just eight minutes playing time. He did however play a full season with NPC champions Canterbury and captained the New Zealand Under 21s.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} and final day, Bhuvan passes his century, while most of the later wickets fall. Ismail returns to bat {{with the help of a}} runner and passes his half-century, {{reducing}} the required runs to an <b>attainable</b> total. The game comes down to the last over with Kachra on strike. With one ball remaining and the team down five runs, Kachra knocks the ball a short distance, managing a single. However, the umpire signals no ball. Bhuvan returns to bat and swings extremely hard at the next ball, hitting the ball high in the air towards the boundary. Russell backpedals and catches it, gleefully believing that the British team has won — until he realises that he has caught the ball beyond the boundary, giving six runs, and therefore victory, to Bhuvan's team. Even as they celebrate the victory, the drought ends as a rainstorm erupts.|$|E
5|$|Specifying power levels over 100% {{may seem}} nonsensical, {{but there was}} a logic behind it. The 100% level does not mean the maximum {{physical}} power level <b>attainable,</b> rather it was a specification decided on during engine development—the expected rated power level. When later studies indicated the engine could operate safely at levels above 100%, these higher levels became standard. Maintaining the original relationship of power level to physical thrust helps reduce confusion, as it created an unvarying fixed relationship so that test data (or operational data from past or future missions) can be easily compared. If the power level was increased, and that new value was said to be 100%, then all previous data and documentation would either require changing, or cross-checking against what physical thrust corresponded to 100% power level on that date. Engine power level affects engine reliability, with studies indicating the probability of an engine failure increasing rapidly with power levels over 104.5%, which was why power levels above 104.5% were retained for contingency use only.|$|E
5|$|The Scandinavian nations Sweden, Norway and Finland, {{as well as}} the Soviet Union, {{repeated}} their {{dominance of}} the 1960 cross-country skiing medal tally in 1964 – together, they won all of the medals <b>attainable</b> for this sport. Similarly, Germany had great success at the luge competition, with the Unified Team of Germany winning five of the available nine medals. Two participants representing Great Britain placed first in the two-man bobsleigh event, earning that nation its first Winter Olympics gold medal in 12 years. Lidiya Skoblikova, a speed skater representing the Soviet Union, earned the most medals at the 1964 Games, winning gold in all four of the women's events in her sport. This achievement made Skoblikova the first Winter Olympian to win four individual gold medals in one edition of the Games.|$|E
5|$|Van Dijk was {{selected}} to represent her country at the Olympic Games in London, and she competed in the road race and the individual time trial {{on the road and}} in the team pursuit on the track. In the road race, Van Dijk was a domestique for Marianne Vos, who won the gold medal. Van Dijk attacked five times but finished outside the time limit. Because the victory of Marianne Vos was seen as a team performance, Van Dijk, Loes Gunnewijk and Annemiek van Vleuten were all subsequently honoured in both the Holland Heineken House and the Ridderzaal. In the time trial, Van Dijk finished eighth. She said afterwards that she was afraid to start too fast and subsequently lost {{a lot of time in}} the first part of the race. In the team pursuit, Van Dijk finished sixth together with Kirsten Wild, Amy Pieters and Vera Koedooder. In the qualification heats, the team had held the Olympic record for a short period and they rode a new Dutch national record in round one. According to Van Dijk, sixth place was the highest <b>attainable</b> place the team could have hoped to achieve.|$|E

25|$|The naïve Roofline {{provides}} just {{an upper}} bound (the theoretical maximum) to performance. Although {{it can still}} give useful insights on the <b>attainable</b> performance, it {{does not provide a}} complete picture of what is actually limiting it. If for instance the considered kernel or application performs far below the Roofline, it might be useful to capture other performance ceilings, other than simple peak bandwidth and performance, to better guide the programmer on which optimization to implement, or even to assess the suitability of the architecture used with respect to the analyzed kernel or application. The added ceilings impose then a limit on the <b>attainable</b> performance that is below the actual Roofline, and indicate that the kernel or application cannot break through anyone of these celining without first performing the associated optimization.|$|E

25|$|A {{recent report}} by the Australian CSIRO found that {{forestry}} and forest-related options are the most significant and most easily achieved carbon sink making up 105 Mt per year CO2-e or about 75 per cent of the total figure <b>attainable</b> for the Australian state of Queensland from 2010-2050. Among the forestry options, the CSIRO report announced, forestry with the primary aim of carbon storage (called carbon forestry) clearly has the highest <b>attainable</b> carbon storage capacity (77 Mt CO2-e/yr) {{and is one of the}} easiest options to implement compared with biodiversity plantings, pre-1990 eucalypts, post 1990 plantations and managed regrowth. Legal strategies to encourage this form of biosequestration include permanent protection of forests in National Parks or on the World Heritage List, properly funded management and bans on use of rainforest timbers and inefficient uses such as woodchipping old growth forest.|$|E
