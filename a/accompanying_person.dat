40|$|In {{last two}} decades {{medicine}} and nursery have experienced many reforms. In-patients are regarded self-contained human beings, persons with biopsychosocial needs. The holistic approach of human reflects also in paediatrics. After 1990 family has {{become a part of}} medical and nursery process. In case of a child hospitalisation contacts of the child and his/her family are not constrainedly interrupted but on the contrary there occurs a possibility of a common stay of children and parents or other persons caring for the child. For my Diploma Thesis I chose the theme: "Stay of a child in hospital in terms of an <b>accompanying</b> <b>person.</b> " This thesis contains two parts, the theoretical and empirical one. The theoretical part is divided into nine chapters. The first chapter is devoted to history of common hospitalisation of a child and his/her mother, the second one describes hospitalisation of a child with an <b>accompanying</b> <b>person</b> at present. In other chapters there are described rights of a child and accompanying persons, individual development periods of a child in connection with a disease and hospitalisation, what effect do disease or pain have on the child and reaction of the child to hospitalisation. Following chapters are devoted to the nursery process at childrens department and to medical care organisation in the Czech Republic. The empirical part is focused on finding out the level of satisfaction with the nursery care for a hospitalised child in terms of an <b>accompanying</b> <b>person,</b> which was directly the objective of the Diploma Thesis. The research proceeded in form of a quantitative investigation using a questionnaire survey. To complete and perfect the information obtained I used the qualitative investigation which proceeded in form of a depth interview. In conclusion it is possible to say that all the four hypotheses proved true: the hypothesis 1 An <b>accompanying</b> <b>person</b> is satisfied with the nursery care for a child in hospital. Hypothesis 2 An <b>accompanying</b> <b>person</b> provides a positive evaluation of the approach of nurses, the hypothesis 3 An <b>accompanying</b> <b>person</b> when staying in hospital is sufficiently informed about the child patient regime and the hypothesis 4 An <b>accompanying</b> <b>person</b> is satisfied with the environment of the department. In interviews the respondents mentioned often a missing alarm system in rooms to be the biggest negative of the common stay of a child and an <b>accompanying</b> <b>person</b> in hospital, which means insufficient contact with a nurse in case of a need of an assistance. The respondents liked the most being sufficiently informed about the child patient regime. It will be possible to use the results of the Diploma Thesis for evaluation of quality of the nursery care at children` departments and for proposal of corrective measures in the relevant area, which should lead to increase of satisfaction in the area of care for a hospitalised child and <b>accompanying</b> <b>person...</b>|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the proportion of}} patients who are accompanied by another person (ie, partner, child, relative, friend) during visits to their doctors; to describe the demographic characteristics and role(s) assumed by the main <b>accompanying</b> <b>person</b> {{and the nature of}} the presenting dyads; and to describe the influence of the main <b>accompanying</b> <b>person</b> on the patient-doctor interaction. DESIGN: Prospective observational survey. SETTING: Family practices in London, Ont, and surrounding area. PARTICIPANTS: Eight family physicians completed surveys on 100 consecutive patients attending for both regularly scheduled and emergency visits. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Roles and influence of the main <b>accompanying</b> <b>person.</b> RESULTS: Approximately one third (30. 4 %) of patients were accompanied during visits to their doctors. Children and patients older than 75 years most frequently had another person with them. Most patients (74. 1 %) were accompanied by one person who most often was female (72. 6 %) and between the ages of 21 and 40 years (53. 6 %). The accompanying person's role was most frequently described by doctors as an advocate for the patient (n = 235, 68. 5 %). If the <b>accompanying</b> <b>person</b> was a child, however, the role was most often described as a silent observer (n = 36, 68. 6 %). The influence of the main <b>accompanying</b> <b>person</b> on the patient-doctor encounter was usually described as positive (95. 1 %). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians report that people accompanying patients usually have a positive influence on medical encounters.

In conclusion, I mention the benefits of logotherapy in the pastoral care of the seriously ill and dying. My thesis shows the importance of poimenic and logotherapy in the service of seriously ill and dying. Logotherapy enables the patients to understand their life story in a deeper way. It can also serve to an <b>accompanying</b> <b>person,</b> in his/her service, his/her life and understanding of the seriously ill and dying, to whom he/she comes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{influence}} of an <b>accompanying</b> <b>person</b> (parent, guardian or nurse) {{on the ability}} of an adolescent (post-pubescent, < 20 years of age) to produce a semen sample for cryopreservation, is undetermined, as is the potential for use of urine samples to retrieve sperm in those adolescents that are unable to produce a semen sample. METHODS: The records from 1991 – 2000 inclusive were reviewed to derive those adolescent patients who were unable to produce semen for cryopreservation prior to undergoing treatment for a malignant condition. RESULTS: During the study period 238 adolescents attended our unit of whom 205 (86. 1 %) banked semen (‘producers’). The remaining 33 adolescents (13. 9 %) were initially unable to produce a sample (‘non-producers’), four of these provided a urine specimen for analysis (12. 1 %) and of these one had sufficient sperm for cryopreservation. Of the ‘accompanied ’ patients 29. 7 % (19 / 64) were non-producers while in the ‘unaccompanied’ patients only 8. 0 % (14 / 174) were non-producers (χ 2 16. 58, P < 0. 001). The relative risk (RR) of not producing a semen sample for the accompanied group of patients was greater than that for the unaccompanied group (RR 3. 689, 95 % confidence interval: 2. 0 – 6. 9). One patient returning alone successfully provided a semen sample for storage. CONCLUSION: Units should consider the effect of the presence of an <b>accompanying</b> <b>person</b> when an adolescent is unable to produce a semen sample and should consider requesting urine to retrieve sperm.

40|$|Aims and objectives. To {{investigate}} {{the factors that}} influence satisfaction with emergency care among individuals accompanying patients to the emergency department and explore agreement between the triage nurse and <b>accompanying</b> <b>person</b> regarding urgency. Background. Many patients seeking treatment in hospital are escorted by an <b>accompanying</b> <b>person,</b> who may be a friend, family member or carer. Several factors influence patient satisfaction with emergency care, including waiting time and time to treatment. It is also influenced by provision of information and interpersonal relations between staff and patients. Research on satisfaction has focused on the patient perspective; however, individuals who accompany patients are potential consumers. Knowledge about the ways accompanying persons perceive the patient's medical condition and level of urgency will identify areas for improved patient outcomes. Design and methods. A prospective cross-sectional survey with a consecutive sample (n = 128 response rate 83. 7 %) was undertaken. Data were collected in an Australian metropolitan teaching hospital with about 32, 000 visits to the emergency department each year. The Consumer Emergency Satisfaction Scale was used to measure satisfaction with nursing care. Results. Significant differences in perceptions of patient urgency between accompanying persons and nurses were found. Those people accompanying patients of a higher urgency were significantly more satisfied than those accompanying patients of a lower urgency. These results were independent of real waiting time or the accompanying person's knowledge of the patients' triage status. In addition, older accompanying persons were more satisfied with emergency care than younger accompanying persons. Discussion. Little {{attention has been paid to}} the social interactions that occur between nurses and patients at triage and the ways in which these interactions might impact satisfaction with emergency care. Relevance to clinical practice. Good interpersonal relationships can positively influence satisfaction with the emergency visit. This relationship can contribute to improved patient care and health outcomes...|$|E

As a consequence, a variety of strategies are observed, including those involving an actor to another one, but also for the same actor according to the moment. It is not obvious how to get a comprehensive view of the mental representations at work in a person’s brain during many human tasks, and the argumentation rather than the explicit decision proposal is crucial (Forslund, 1995) : It is better to store advantages and disadvantages rather than the final decisions for representing decision making...|$|E

A cross-sectional study was carried out and its target was people accompanying children during consultations that resulted in antimicrobial prescription (n= 209), from May to June, 2007. A score (4 - 12) was generated to evaluate the understanding based on correct and incorrect/unknown statements about the prescription. Understanding was considered adequate when the score was below 6. 5.

Mobility means the possibility of freely moving, without support of any <b>accompanying</b> <b>person,</b> at home, {{in public and private}} buildings, and in open spaces, as the streets of the town. Mobile and wireless technologies, and in particular the ones used to locate persons or objects, can be used to realize navigation systems in an intelligent environment.

Using these technologies together with Text To Speech systems and a mobile-based database the authors developed a cost effective, easy-to-use orientation and navigation system: RadioVirgilio/SesamoNet 1. The cost effectiveness is due to the recovery of RFID identity tags from cattle slaughtering: these tags are then borrowed to create a grid used for navigation.
