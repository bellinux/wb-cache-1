However, the FB-22 in its planned form appears to have been canceled with the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review and subsequent developments, in lieu of a larger subsonic bomber with a much greater range.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of deuterium in comet Hale–Bopp {{in the form}} of heavy water was found to be <b>about</b> <b>twice</b> that of Earth's oceans.

5|$|Although Jupiter {{would need}} to be about 75 times as massive to fuse {{hydrogen}} and become a star, the smallest red dwarf is only about 30 percent larger in radius than Jupiter. Despite this, Jupiter still radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun; the amount of heat produced inside it is similar to the total solar radiation it receives. This additional heat is generated by the Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism through contraction. This process causes Jupiter to shrink by about 2cm each year. When it was first formed, Jupiter was much hotter and was <b>about</b> <b>twice</b> its current diameter.|$|E
5|$|Amondson {{attended}} Warner Pacific College in Portland, Oregon, {{and graduated}} with a Bachelor of Science degree in zoology. In college, he occasionally drank wine.

Amondson estimated that after divinity school, he drank beer <b>about</b> <b>twice</b> a year.

His books on the latter subject have won the Montagu Trophy (once) and the Nicholas-Joseph Cugnot Award (twice), both recognizing outstanding automotive historical writing. In 2001 he again received the Cugnot award from the Society of Automotive Historians (SAH) for his book about {{the early years of}} the Volkswagen, Battle for the Beetle.

5|$|In {{accordance}} with magnetic data, electrical resistivity of curium increases with temperature – <b>about</b> <b>twice</b> between 4 and 60 K – and then remains nearly constant up to room temperature. There {{is a significant}} increase in resistivity over time (about 10 µΩ·cm/h) due to self-damage of the crystal lattice by alpha radiation. This makes uncertain the absolute resistivity value for curium (about 125 µΩ·cm). The resistivity of curium {{is similar to that of}} gadolinium and of the actinides plutonium and neptunium, but is significantly higher than that of americium, uranium, polonium and thorium.|$|E
5|$|Many {{objective}} measures {{show the}} positive impact of Hubble data on astronomy.

Looking at papers several years after their publication, about one-third of all astronomy papers have no citations, while only 2% of papers based on Hubble data have no citations. On average, a paper based on Hubble data receives <b>about</b> <b>twice</b> as many citations as papers based on non-Hubble data. Of the 200 papers published each year that receive the most citations, about 10% are based on Hubble data.|$|E

Women who are exposed to indoor coal smoke have <b>about</b> <b>twice</b> the risk and a number of the by-products of burning biomass are known or suspected carcinogens. This risk affects about 2.4billion people globally, and is believed to account for 1.5% of lung cancer deaths.|$|E
