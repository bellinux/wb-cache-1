40|$|Over 1000 {{marine and}} {{terrestrial}} pollen diagrams and Some hundreds of vertebrate faunal sequences {{have been studied}} in the Austral-Asian region bisected by the PEPII transect, from the Russian arctic extending south through east Asia, Indochina, southern <b>Asia,</b> <b>insular</b> Southeast Asia (Sunda), Melanesia, Australasia (Sahul) and the western south Pacific. The majority of these records are Holocene but sufficient data exist to allow {{the reconstruction of the}} changing biomes over at least the past 200, 000 years. The PEPII transect is free of the effects of large northern ice caps yet exhibits vegetational change in glacial cycles of a similar scale to North America. Major processes that can be discerned are the response of tropical forests in both lowlands and uplands to glacial cycles, the expansion of humid vegetation at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition and the change in faunal and vegetational controls as humans occupy the region. There is evidence for major changes in the intensity of monsoon and El Nino-Southern oscillation variability both on glacial-interglacial and longer time scales with much of the region experiencing a long-term trend towards more variable and/or drier climatic conditions. Temperature variation is most marked in high latitudes and high altitudes with precipitation providing the major climate control in lower latitude, lowland areas. At least some boundary shifts may be the response of vegetation to changing CO 2 levels in the atmosphere. Numerous questions of detail remain, however, and current resolution is too coarse to examine the degree of synchroneity of millennial scale change along the transect.

Thus, {{it is in a}} {{strategic}} location for several spheres of influence and contact from South Asia to the west and East <b>Asia</b> and <b>Insular</b> Southeast <b>Asia</b> to the east. The evidence of these contacts is well-documented (Bellina 2007; Bellina and Silapanth 2006; Bellina-Pryce and Silapanth 2008; Glover and Bellina 2011). Excavations from 2006 to 2009 at this late prehistoric site included an archaeobotanical agenda, and the macroremains from the site mirror the material culture having both South Asian and East Asian originated crops. South Asian influence is not evident before the Iron Age in Thailand.|$|R

The earliest fossil finds of the species come from both Europe and Asia, and {{date back to the}} Early Pleistocene. By the late Villafranchian, S. scrofa largely displaced the related S. strozzii, a large, possibly swamp-adapted suid ancestral to the modern S. verrucosus throughout the Eurasian mainland, restricting it to <b>insular</b> <b>Asia.</b> Its closest wild relative is the bearded pig of Malacca and surrounding islands.|$|R

Their polymorphism has initially been studied throughout {{populations of the}} world to demonstrate the "Out of Africa " hypothesis. Here, to correlate the distribution of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in different populations of <b>insular</b> <b>Asia,</b> we analyze the mtDNA information (lineages) obtained from genotyping of the hyper variable region (HVS I & II) among 1400 individuals from island Southeast Asia (ISEA), Taiwan and Fujian and supplemented with the analysis of relevant coding region polymorphisms. Lineages that best represented a clade (a branch of the genetic tree) in the phylogeny were further analyzed using complete genomic mtDNA sequencing. Finally, these complete mtDNA sequences were used to construct a most parsimonious tree which now constitutes the most up 鄄 to 鄄 date mtDNA dataset available on ISEA and Taiwan. This analysis has exposed new insights of the evolutionary history of <b>insular</b> <b>Asia</b> and has strong implications in assessing possible correlations with linguistic, archaeology, demography and the NPC distribution in populations within these regions.

30|$|People, {{crops and}} {{technology}} can spread more rapidly {{east and west}} than north and south. Crops require time to adapt to different day lengths associated with change in latitude. The Ganges-Brahmaputra Rivers at about 25 °N is about {{as far south as}} the Yellow River (± 35 °N) is north of the Yangtze River (± 30 °N). This is a relatively small span of latitudes and would not have taken many generations for domesticated rice to adapt to latitudes of the Indo-Gangetic plain given that wild rice genetic resources were (and are) abundant there. In contrast, spread of rice across <b>insular</b> <b>Asia,</b> through the Philippines to Indonesia, in excess of 30 ° latitude spread where wild rice is not so abundant, would have been a much slower process.|$|R
40|$|Tropical peat lands {{constitute}} one of {{the most}} important area for the land utilization in <b>insular</b> <b>Asia,</b> although peat lands are widely distributed in Asia of 22. 2 million ha compared with 5. 2 million ha in America and 3. 5 million ha in Africa (Kyuma et al. 1986). 18. 2 million ha of peat exist in <b>insular</b> <b>Asia.</b> On the other hand, peat swamp forests are distributed 90, 884 hectares in Brunei Darussalam. These forests dominantly consist of pure Shorea albida (Alan) stands classified into three forest types such as Alan Batu, Alan Bunga, Alan Padang (Anderson 1964). In this study, I tried to clarify the Alan forest structures and regeneration process at different site condition. Different forest type where observed from outside of peat dome to center such as the mixed swamp forest dominated Drybalanops rappa, Alan Batu, Alan Bunga, Alan Padang and Padan Paya forests. Among these forests, Alan forests occupied wide area and S. albida as monoculture stand is very peculiar in tropical rain forests associated with its phenological characteristics and site condition of peat swamp. Different Alan forest types are characterized on their heights and ground water levels. On the seedling establishment and regeneration process, although S. albida blossomed in February, 1986 in Brunei and Sarawak, the seedling population of S. albida almost dissapeared from the forest floor two year after. The main factors of mortality were considered to be the shortage of light intensity (less than 700 lux) and the water condition of the habitat which becomes easily dry on days without rainfall on the root system and becomes flooded after continual rainfall on the peat horizon. It is also appeared on the point of demography that the energy allocation pattern to root weight of S. angustifolia more than 30 %. Peat land utilization must be taking into account of fragile ecosystem of S. albida forest on its regeneration process...|$|R
40|$|Aim We {{aimed at}} {{producing}} a uniform;regional; land cover map of South and Southeast Asia based on;sub-regional; mapping results {{generated in the}} context of the Global Land Cover 2000 project. Location The region of tropical and sub-tropical South and Southeast Asia stretches from the Himalayas and the southern border of China in the north, to Sri Lanka and Indonesia in the south, and from Pakistan in the west to the islands of New Guinea in the far east. Methods The regional land cover map is based on sub-regional digital mapping results derived from SPOT 4 -VEGETATION satellite data of the years 1998 to 2000. Image processing, digital classification and thematic mapping were performed separately for the three sub-regions: South Asia, continental Southeast <b>Asia</b> and <b>insular</b> Southeast <b>Asia.</b> Landsat TM images, field data and existing national maps served as reference. We used the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) for coding the sub-regional land cover classes and for aggregating the latter to a uniform regional legend. A validation was performed based on a systematic grid of sample points, referring to visual interpretation from high resolution Landsat imagery. Regional land cover area estimates were obtained and compared to FAO statistics for the categories and cropland Results The regional map displays ultimately 26 land cover classes. The LCCS coding provided a standardized class description, independent from local class names, it also allowed us to maintain the link to the detailed sub-regional land cover classes. The validation of the map displayed a mapping accuracy of 72 % for the dominant classes of; and crop land regional area estimates for these classes correspond reasonably well to existing regional statistics. Main conclusions The land cover map of South & Southeast Asia provides a synoptic view on the distribution of land cover of tropical and sub-tropical Asia, it delivers reasonable thematic detail and quantitative estimates of the main land cover proportions. The map may therefore serve for regional stratification or modelling of vegetation cover, but could also support the implementation of forest policies, watershed management or conservation strategies at regional scales.

40|$|Species {{evolve in}} landscapes and environments that change through time. This spatial {{backdrop}} has profound {{effects on the}} diversification and merging of lineages. Populations become isolated by climate change, moving continents, and rising oceans, {{all of these factors}} can impact the evolutionary dynamics of lineages. While the spatial dimension of evolution has been a subject of interest since the inception of biogeography, the approaches to addressing how spatial heterogeneities affect lineages have advanced considerably in recent decades as genetic tools, computational tools, and new methodologies have allowed for explicit spatial hypotheses to be generated using GIS methods that can then be tested with genetic data. The focus of this dissertation examines amphibian evolution at deep temporal scales in relation to a changing global landscape, and sets the stage for examining the spatial dimension across the Asian landscape at shallow temporal scales. Chapter one investigates amphibian evolution and diversification within an explicit spatiotemporal framework in order to understand how spatial variation drives evolutionary patterns of amphibians at global scales. At macroevolutionary scales, global amphibian diversity is strongly correlated with the area of forest rather than the longevity of forests, and signatures of the extensive forest area of the Eocene underlies the dramatic amphibian latitudinal diversity gradient. Chapter two models the changing Asian landscape throughout the Pleistocene in order to understand how glacial and interglacial cycles impact the distribution of habitat types throughout the region. Satellite data on current habitats form the basis for this work. Palynological data are used to validate the models, providing a measure of confidence that the palaeo-predictive models are doing a good job in hind-casting habitats through changing climatic conditions. Asia differs from many other systems in not having been covered in extensive ice sheets during glacial periods, and provides a very different set of habitat dynamics, setting a unique stage for evolutionary dynamics. Habitats across Asia responded in dramatic fashion to changing palaeo-climates, with some habitats undergoing massive expansions and others contracting. The past 140 thousand years have witnessed a highly dynamic landscape. Chapter three delves deeper into palaeo-ecological modeling, and spatially locates stable habitat refugia across Asia for multiple tropical forest, temperate forest, and non-forested habitat types. These refugia are examined with respect to climatic stability and latitude to evaluate if stable climates give rise to stable habitats. Refugia are further examined with respect to terrestrial vertebrate species richness to understand if stable refugia have helped structure contemporary diversity patterns. Strong relationships between habitat stability and species richness were found, indicating that the spatial backdrop has played a pivotal role in contemporary diversity patterns. This indicates that these refugia may be important buffers against climate change and are probably important for the conservation of diversity in Asia. Chapter four focuses in on glacial and interglacial habitat dynamics on the Sundashelf, where dramatic changes in sea-level affect the connectivity of landmasses providing potential migration corridors between mainland SE <b>Asia</b> and <b>insular</b> <b>Asia.</b> I examine how these changing sea levels impact the distribution of habitats across the region and how in turn these habitat changes structure genetic data across the area. I found that high levels of genetic diversity correspond with stable habitats. Chapter five turns its attention to phylogenetics of the family Dicroglossidae, a widespread Old World frog family with high diversity across Asia. This chapter examines the generic assignments and familial monophyly and evaluates how nucleotide substitution models and partitioning affect the phylogenetic informativeness of markers and how this impacts phylogenetic inference. Both partitioning scheme and model selection were found to have profound effects on the phylogenetic informativenss of the genetic data. It was found that there are systemic biases among model selection criteria with the BIC commonly selecting highly parameterized models. It was also found that models of nucleotide substitution are often inadequate in capturing the complexity of empirical data. The monophyly of the Dicroglossidae was supported in these analyses. Many of the genera within the family were found to be monophyletic with the exceptions of the frogs of the Painii group and the Fejervarya. Together, these chapters provide the spatial foundation which sets the stage for research evaluating diversification processes in Dicroglossid frogs across the Old World and within Asia at biogeographic, phylogeographic and population genetics time scales. These analyses provide the first deeper time model-based evaluation of landscape processes for Asia...|$|R
60|$|The Indian Ocean as a Source of Heat in Tertiary Times.--If {{we compare}} the Indian Ocean with the South Atlantic {{we shall see}} that the {{position}} and outline of the former are very favourable for the accumulation of {{a large body of}} warm water moving northwards. Its southern {82} opening between South Africa and Australia is very wide, and the tendency of the trade-winds would be to concentrate the currents towards its north-western extremity, just where the two great channels above described formed an outlet to the northern seas. As will be shown in our nineteenth chapter, there was probably, during the earlier portion of the Tertiary period at least, several large islands in the space between Madagascar and South India; but these had wide and deep channels between them, and their existence may have been favourable to the conveyance of heated water northward, by concentrating the currents, and thus producing massive bodies of moving water analogous to the Gulf Stream of the Atlantic.[22] Less heat would thus be lost by evaporation and radiation in the tropical zone, and an impulse would be acquired which would carry the warm water into the north polar area. About the same period Australia was probably divided into two islands, separated by a wide channel in a north and south direction (see Chapter XXII.), and through this another current would almost certainly set northwards, and be directed to the north-west by the southern extension of Malayan <b>Asia.</b> The more <b>insular</b> condition at this period of Australia, India, and North Africa, with the depression and probable fertility of the Central Asiatic plateau, would lead to the Indian Ocean being traversed by regular trade-winds instead of by variable monsoons, and thus the constant vis a tergo, which is so efficient in the Atlantic, would keep up a steady and powerful current towards the northern parts of the Indian Ocean, and thence through the midst of the European archipelago to the northern seas.|$|R
