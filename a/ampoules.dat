40|$|Abstract—Numerical {{parametric}} {{study is}} conducted {{to study the}} effects of <b>ampoule</b> rotation on the flows and the dopant segregation in vertical bridgman (vb) crystal growth. Calculations were performed in unsteady state. The extended darcy model, which includes the time derivative and coriolis terms, has been employed in the momentum equation. It’s found that the convection, and dopant segregation can be affected significantly by <b>ampoule</b> rotation, and the effect is similar to that by an axial magnetic field. <b>Ampoule</b> rotation decreases the intensity of convection and stretches the flow cell axially. When the convection is weak, the flow can be suppressed almost completely by moderate <b>ampoule</b> rotation and the dopant segregation becomes diffusion-controlled. For stronger convection, the elongated flow cell by <b>ampoule</b> rotation may bring dopant mixing into the bulk melt reducing axial segregation at the early stage of the growth. However, if the cellular flow cannot be suppressed completely, <b>ampoule</b> rotation may induce larger radial segregation due to poor mixing.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{vertical}} Bridgman-Stockbarger apparatus {{was used}} to directionally solidify water upward, {{in the hope that}} detached solidification would evolve from gas bubbles forming on the wall. A large contact angle of the water on the <b>ampoule</b> wall and a high solubility of the dissolved gas caused gas bubbles or tubes to form only at the <b>ampoule</b> wall, and not in the interior. Gas tubes were often nearly periodically spaced around the <b>ampoule</b> wall, with a spacing that increased with <b>ampoule</b> diameter and decreased with freezing rate. The width of the gas tubes was nearly independent of the <b>ampoule</b> diameter and freezing rate. A high degree of detachment was obtained with a rough, nonwetting coating on the <b>ampoule</b> wall, but full detachment was not achieved. This indicates that detachment does not occur by propagation of a single gas bubble around the periphery of the freezing interface. The convection near the freezing interface influenced gas bubble formation, and was outward for a concave freezing interface and inward for a convex interface...|$|R

If the requirements for detaching the melt meniscus from the <b>ampoule</b> wall are not fulfilled by the material-specific parameters (like e. g. wetting behavior between <b>ampoule</b> and melt and the growth angle of the crystal), detachment can be obtained also by the imposition of suitable pressure ratios in the growth <b>ampoule.</b> In the context of this paper, the growth of germanium by the detached and vertical Bridgman processes in pyrolytic boron nitride crucibles will be reported, Typical gap widths between <b>ampoule</b> wall and detached grown crystals are approximately 10 - 50 microns.
