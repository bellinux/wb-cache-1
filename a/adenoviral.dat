25|$|As {{opposed to}} lentiviruses, <b>adenoviral</b> DNA does not {{integrate}} into the genome {{and is not}} replicated during cell division. This limits their use in basic research, although <b>adenoviral</b> vectors are still used in in vitro and also in vivo experiments. Their primary applications are in gene therapy and vaccination. Since humans commonly {{come in contact with}} adenoviruses, which cause respiratory, gastrointestinal and eye infections, majority of patients have already developed neutralizing antibodies which can inactivate the virus before it can reach the target cell. To overcome this problem scientists are currently investigating adenoviruses that infect different species to which humans do not have immunity.|$|E
25|$|They have a {{broad range}} of {{vertebrate}} hosts; in humans, more than 50 distinct <b>adenoviral</b> serotypes have been found to cause a wide range of illnesses, from mild respiratory infections in young children (known as the common cold) to life-threatening multi-organ disease in people with a weakened immune system.|$|E
25|$|Tissue-specific {{control of}} Oa1 {{transcription}} is by a 617bp long E-box region bound by Mitf. Mitf {{has been shown}} to regulate expression of many melanosomal genes like TYR and TRP-1 through the E-box motif (CATGTG). Vetrini et al. have used <b>adenoviral</b> vectors to study tissue-specificity of Oa1 transcription through Mitf and observed that this regulation in conserved in human Oa1 gene.|$|E
25|$|Once an {{individual}} has been diagnosed, the treatment goal is to avoid precipitating episodes that can cause an increased ammonia concentration. The most common treatment combines a low protein diet with nitrogen scavenging agents. Liver transplant is considered curative for this disease.

25|$|Ciclosporin is {{approved}} by the FDA to prevent and treat graft-versus-host disease in bone-marrow transplantation and to prevent rejection of kidney, heart, and liver transplants. It is also approved in the US {{for the treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, as an ophthalmic emulsion for the treatment of dry eyes (a common symptom of Sjögren's syndrome), and as a treatment for persistent nummular keratitis following <b>adenoviral</b> keratoconjunctivitis.|$|E
25|$|Adenoviruses is {{the most}} common cause of viral {{conjunctivitis}} (<b>adenoviral</b> keratoconjunctivitis). Herpetic keratoconjunctivitis (caused by herpes simplex viruses) can be serious and requires treatment with acyclovir. Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is a highly contagious disease caused by one of two enteroviruses, Enterovirus 70 and Coxsackievirus A24. These were first identified in an outbreak in Ghana in 1969, and have spread worldwide since then, causing several epidemics.|$|E
25|$|Adenoviruses are unusually stable to {{chemical}} or physical agents and adverse pH conditions, allowing for prolonged survival {{outside of the}} body and water. Adenoviruses are spread primarily via respiratory droplets, however they can also be spread by fecal routes. Research into the molecular mechanisms underlying <b>adenoviral</b> transmission provide empirical evidence in support of the hypothesis that cellular receptors for adenovirus and coxsackievirus (CARs) are needed to transport adenoviruses into certain naive/progenitor cell types.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adenoviral</b> E1A-associated protein of 300kDa (p300) and the CREB-binding protein (CBP) make up {{the next}} family of HATs. This family of HATs contain HAT domains that are {{approximately}} 500 residues long and contain bromodomains as well as three cysteine-histidine rich domains that help with protein interactions. These HATs are known to acetylate all of the histone subunits in the nucleosome. They also {{have the ability to}} acetylate and mediate non-histone proteins involved in transcription and are also involved in the cell-cycle, differentiation and apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|In animal {{models of}} cardiac disease, {{functions}} of beta-catenin have been unveiled. In a guinea pig model of aortic stenosis and left ventricular hypertrophy, beta-catenin {{was shown to}} change subcellular localization from intercalated discs to the cytosol, despite {{no change in the}} overall cellular abundance of beta-catenin. vinculin showed a similar profile of change. N-cadherin showed no change, and there was no compensatory upregulation of plakoglobin at intercalated discs in the absence of beta-catenin. In a hamster model of cardiomyopathy and heart failure, cell-cell adhesions were irregular and disorganized, and expression levels of adherens junction/intercalated disc and nuclear pools of beta-catenin were decreased. These data suggest that a loss of beta-catenin {{may play a role in}} the diseased intercalated discs that have been associated with cardiac muscle hypertrophy and heart failure. In a rat model of myocardial infarction, <b>adenoviral</b> gene transfer of nonphosphorylatable, constitutively-active beta-catenin decreased MI size, activated the cell cycle, and reduced the amount of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes and cardiac myofibroblasts. This finding was coordinate with enhanced expression of pro-survival proteins, survivin and Bcl-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor while promoting the differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. These findings suggest that beta-catenin can promote the regeneration and healing process following myocardial infarction. In a spontaneously-hypertensive heart failure rat model, investigators detected a shuttling of beta-catenin from the intercalated disc/sarcolemma to the nucleus, evidenced by a reduction of beta-catenin expression in the membrane protein fraction and an increase in the nuclear fraction. Additionally, they found a weakening in the association between glycogen synthase kinase-3β and beta-catenin, which may indicate altered protein stability. Overall, results suggest that an enhanced nuclear localization of beta-catenin may be important in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy.|$|E
2500|$|The minimal {{set of the}} <b>adenoviral</b> genes {{required}} for efficient generation of progeny AAV particles, was discovered by Matsushita, Ellinger et al. This discovery allowed for new production methods of recombinant AAV, which do not require <b>adenoviral</b> co-infection of the AAV-producing cells. [...] In the absence of helper virus or genotoxic factors, AAV DNA can either integrate into the host genome or persist in episomal form. In the former case integration is mediated by Rep78 and Rep68 proteins and requires the presence of ITRs flanking the region being integrated. In mice, the AAV genome has been observed persisting {{for long periods of}} time in quiescent tissues, such as skeletal muscles, in episomal form (a circular head-to-tail conformation).|$|E
2500|$|There are no {{antiviral}} {{drugs to}} treat <b>adenoviral</b> infections, so treatment is largely {{directed at the}} symptoms (such as acetaminophen for fever). A doctor may give antibiotic eyedrops for conjunctivitis, while awaiting results of bacterial cultures, and to help prevent secondary bacterial infections. [...] Currently, there is no adenovirus vaccine available to the general public, but a vaccine is available for the United States military for Types 4 and 7.|$|E
2500|$|Gene {{therapy is}} a {{technique}} for correcting defective genes responsible for disease development. In the future, gene therapy may provide a way to cure genetic disorders, such as severe combined immunodeficiency, cystic fibrosis or even haemophilia A. Because these diseases result from mutations in the DNA sequence for specific genes, [...] gene therapy trials have used viruses to deliver unmutated copies of these genes to {{the cells of the}} patient's body. There have been a huge number of laboratory successes with gene therapy. However, several problems of viral gene therapy must be overcome before it gains widespread use. Immune response to viruses not only impedes the delivery of genes to target cells but can cause severe complications for the patient. In one of the early gene therapy trials in 1999 this led to the death of Jesse Gelsinger, who was treated using an <b>adenoviral</b> vector.|$|E

50|$|A more {{specific}} use of HEK 293 cells {{is in the}} propagation of <b>adenoviral</b> vectors. Viruses offer an efficient means of delivering genes into cells, which they evolved to do, and are thus of great use as experimental tools. However, as pathogens, they also present a risk to the experimenter. This danger can be avoided {{by the use of}} viruses which lack key genes, and which are thus unable to replicate after entering a cell. In order to propagate such viral vectors, a cell line that expresses the missing genes is required. Since HEK 293 cells express a number of <b>adenoviral</b> genes, they can be used to propagate <b>adenoviral</b> vectors in which these genes (typically, E1 and E3) are deleted, such as AdEasy.|$|E
50|$|For {{adenovirus}} replication to occur, {{the host}} cell must be induced into S phase by viral proteins interfering with cell cycle proteins. The <b>adenoviral</b> E1A gene {{is responsible for}} inactivation of several proteins, including retinoblastoma, allowing entry into S-phase. The adenovirus E1B55kDa gene cooperates with another <b>adenoviral</b> product, E4ORF6, to inactivate p53, thus preventing apoptosis. It was initially proposed that an adenovirus mutant lacking the E1B55kDa gene, dl1520 (ONYX-015), could replicate selectively in p53 deficient cells.|$|E
