5|$|The popular {{painting}} shows a {{group of}} 125 wedding guests wearing clothing from the times, presented in the canvas in an apparently chaotic way in an outdoor party surrounded by trees. The brides wore black {{as it was the}} Renaissance period and the men wore codpieces, which were an important part of their clothing at the time. Voyeurism (spying on people engaged in intimate behaviours) is shown throughout the entire work amongst almost <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{thousand}} years before The Sword of Shannara, an Elf named Galaphile gathers <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who still had {{some knowledge of}} the old world to Paranor to try to bring peace and order to all of the races. They name themselves the First Druid Council. Brona, a rogue Druid, and his followers leave, taking the Ildatch with them; this magical tome controls their minds. 250 years later, Brona begins the First War of the Races when he convinces all Men to attack the other races. He almost succeeds in seizing rule of the Four Lands, but the tide turns, and the war ends with his defeat and disappearance. The Druids divide the Four Lands among the races and become reclusive, withdrawing to Paranor because of their shame at the betrayal by one of their own members.|$|E

2500|$|They {{were all}} Englishmen, {{supposed}} to be a single people, with one definable interest. Legitimacy came from membership in Parliament <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sovereign realm, not elections from people. As Blackstone explained, the Member is [...] "not bound ... to consult with, or take <b>the</b> advice, <b>of</b> his constituents." [...] As Constitutional historian Gordon Wood elaborated, [...] "The Commons <b>of</b> England contained <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people's</b> power and were considered to be <b>the</b> very persons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> they represented." ...|$|R
30|$|At {{the same}} time, {{it is worth}} noting that the ethnic {{minority}} areas account for more than half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country’s territory. They are primarily plateaus, mountains, and grasslands. As a result, a great many ethnic minorities engaged in animal husbandry, while <b>the</b> Han <b>peoples</b> engaged primarily in agriculture, forming a different type of economy. China’s five major pastoral areas are in ethnic minority regions, and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peoples</b> engaged in nomadic herding are ethnic minorities.|$|R
5|$|Aspinall's job as {{personal}} assistant consisted of driving to concerts and meetings, but mostly meant just being there whenever someone needed something. Aspinall {{went on the}} first trip to America, and when George Harrison became ill with a fever and had a temperature of , {{he was ordered to}} stay in bed, so Aspinall stood in for him for The Ed Sullivan Show camera rehearsals.; however, Harrison was back in time for the final shooting. Before the cover of Sgt. Pepper's could be completed by Peter Blake, Aspinall was sent out to find photographs of <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> that were to be shown on the front cover. Aspinall suggested the idea of Sergeant Pepper being the compere, who would introduce the group, and the reprise of the title song {{near the end of the}} album.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{was created in}} November 1942 and published in the March 6, 1943 issue of The Saturday Evening Post. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> in the picture were friends and family of Rockwell in Arlington, Vermont, who were photographed individually and painted into the scene. The work depicts {{a group of people}} gathered around a dinner table for a holiday meal. Having been partially created on Thanksgiving Day to depict the celebration, it has become an iconic representation of the Thanksgiving holiday and family holiday gatherings in general. The Post published Freedom from Want with a corresponding essay by Carlos Bulosan as part of the Four Freedoms series. Despite many who endured sociopolitical hardships abroad, Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring the socioeconomic hardships domestically, and it thrust him into prominence.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{confirmed}} that {{the site of the}} fire had been used as an illegal factory to manufacture leather bags. The factory was located {{on the third floor of}} a four-story building, which also featured residential units. Investigators determined that the first and second floors of the structure housed additional illegal factories. The factory destroyed in the fire was found to be owned and operated by Tenex Exports, and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who were killed or injured in the fire slept in the factory at night, a situation that is not considered unusual in India. There was had just one emergency exit, and 40 workers were housed in the structure at the time of the fire, and the owner had locked the factory at night to prevent workers from running away with leather goods. The building was located in the Tannix International, Topsia, in the South 24 Parganas district of Greater Kolkata region.|$|E
50|$|I asked myself, “If {{this were}} a museum, what kind of museum could it be?” The answer: a museum that would tell <b>the</b> stories <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peoples</b> coming to this land.

5|$|While Emperor Daozong's reign {{started off}} strong, it too was {{eventually}} plagued by factional infighting, aggravated by the emperor's own general weakness. The emperor's first major error was in ordering {{the execution of}} Xiao A La, a loyal minister and close friend of the emperor, whom the emperor was nonetheless convinced to execute by a rival minister. The 14th-century History of Liao speculates that had Xiao A La not been killed, two major incidents that came to dominate Emperor Daozong's reign would have been avoided. The first of these incidents was a rebellion in 1063, when several high-ranking members of the Yelü clan, led by a grandson of Emperor Shengzong, attempted to assassinate Emperor Daozong {{while he was on}} a hunting trip. He was saved with the assistance of troops led by his mother, Empress Dowager Ren Yi, and he retaliated by executing <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> involved in the plot, as well as their immediate families.|$|E

50|$|However, {{his second}} reign was {{viewed by the}} Samians as unfair and too strict. He {{had a lot of}} {{administrative}} skills but he lacked in patience and calmness. He ended up becoming abrupt and arrogant. Thus he lost <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people's</b> and <b>the</b> parliament's support. He made more and more enemies every day. He ignored the privileges and rights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Principality <b>of</b> Samos twice. <b>The</b> first time he dismissed the legally elected Parliament and the second he asked the Ottoman government to send 200 soldiers in order to reinforce the two armies that already remained illegally on the island.|$|R

25|$|In {{succession}} Sicily {{was ruled}} by the Sunni Aghlabid dynasty in Tunisia and the Shiite Fatimids in Egypt. However, throughout this period, Sunni Muslims formed {{the majority of the}} Muslim community in Sicily, with most (if not <b>all)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of Palermo being Sunni, leading to their hostility to the Shia Kalbids. The Sunni population of the island was replenished following sectarian rebellions across north Africa from 943 to 47 against the Fatimids harsh religious policies, leading to several waves of refugees fleeing to Sicily in an attempt to escape Fatimid retaliation. The Byzantines took advantage of temporary discord to occupy the eastern end of the island for several years.|$|E

This language was distinct from <b>the</b> languages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apalachee, Timucua, Mayaca, and Ais people in central and northern Florida.

25|$|Stephens {{and fellow}} Georgia Representative Robert Toombs campaigned for the {{election}} of Zachary Taylor as President in 1848.

25|$|Not <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> in {{the region}} lived in cliff dwellings; many colonized the canyon rims and slopes in multifamily {{structures}} that grew to unprecedented size as populations swelled. Decorative motifs for these sandstone/mortar constructions, both cliff dwellings and not, included T-shaped windows and doors. This has been taken by some archaeologists, such as Stephen Lekson (1999), {{as evidence of the}} continuing reach of the Chaco Canyon elite system, which had seemingly collapsed around a century before. Other researchers see these motifs as part of a more generalized Puebloan style and/or spiritual significance, rather than evidence of a continuing specific elite socioeconomic system.|$|E
