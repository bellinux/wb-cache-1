Professional cameos included David Hellman (Braid) in San Francisco and Peter Molyneux himself in London, where he gave an uncharacteristically fiery keynote speech that encouraged developers to [...] "innovate ... come together and do crazy things". While most games tended to consist of normal game mechanics underneath a bizarre concept, Wired said that their inability to deliver on their promise was the jam's [...] "most Molyneuxian touch".|$|E
