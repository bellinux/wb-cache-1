5|$|Hurricane Andrew was a Category 5 Atlantic {{hurricane}} {{that struck}} the Bahamas and Florida in mid-August 1992, the most destructive hurricane to ever hit the state. It {{was the strongest}} in decades and the costliest hurricane to make landfall <b>anywhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States until it was surpassed by Katrina in 2005. Andrew caused major damage in the Bahamas and Louisiana, but the greatest impact was felt in South Florida, with sustained wind speeds as high as 165 mph (270 km/h). Passing directly through the city of Homestead in Dade County (now known as Miami-Dade County), it stripped many homes of all but their concrete foundations. In total, it destroyed more than 63,500 houses, damaged more than 124,000 others, caused $26.5 billion in damage, and left 65 people dead.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{the site}} was {{proposed}} for commercial development, provoking an energetic campaign by the Chiswick Wildlife Group, formed in March 1982, which became the local branch of the London Wildlife Trust. The threat to {{the site was}} one of the first to be highlighted by the London Wildlife Trust on its formation in October 1981. The campaign led to a Public Inquiry in July 1983, which determined that the site should be devoted to nature conservation. This was the first time <b>anywhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom that a Public Inquiry had ruled in favour of nature in a city, and the Gunnersbury Triangle example became a test case.|$|E

25|$|While the pretrial {{motion to}} quash the {{indictment}} was denied, Leibowitz had positioned {{the case for}} appeal.

25|$|Nutraceutical Corporation, a {{supplement}} manufacturer based in Park City, Utah, challenged {{the legality of}} the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids as exceeding the authority given the agency by the Dietary Health Supplements and Education Act. Nutraceutical Corporation stated that while they did not intend to restart marketing ephedra, they were concerned about the scope of the FDA's regulatory action. Judge Tena Campbell of the Utah Federal District Court ruled that the FDA had not proven that low doses of ephedra alkaloids were unsafe, although she also noted that studies to address the safety of low-dose ephedra would be unethical. Nevertheless, her ruling overturned the ban on the sale of ephedra alkaloids in the state of Utah, and called into question whether the ban could be enforced <b>anywhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States.|$|E

500|$|Hazen's regiment, {{which was}} {{significantly}} reduced in size by the retreat from Quebec, was assigned first to Ticonderoga, {{and then to}} Albany, {{in the summer and}} fall of 1776, before being ordered to winter quarters at Fishkill, New York. [...] During this time, Hazen continued recruiting, receiving permission from Congress to recruit <b>anywhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. [...] In the northern states he ran into difficulties, as those states were having trouble filling their own regimental lines; he was often outbid by other recruiters. [...] Antill, who recruited in the central states (primarily New Jersey, Maryland, and Pennsylvania), had greater success. [...] By June 1777, the regiment reached about 700 members, out of an authorized strength of 1,000. [...] The cultural differences between the original Quebec enlistees and the new recruits from the Thirteen Colonies was a regular source of friction within the regiment, and Hazen consequently kept the French-speakers in companies separated from the English-speakers.|$|E
