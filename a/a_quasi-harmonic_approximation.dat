Firstly, there is no single {{answer to the question of}} calculations accuracy of the vacancy formation energy. Secondly, the existing phenomenological theories tacitly assume that the vacancy formation energy and entropy of vacancy formation do not depend on temperature. Objective. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of temperature factor on the free energy of vacancy formation and its components in a number of metals within the quasi-harmonic approximation. Methods. The vacancy formation energy and entropy in FCC Al, Ag, and Pd are determined as a function of temperature using ab initio methods within <b>a</b> <b>quasi-harmonic</b> <b>approximation.</b> Results. It was shown, that the vacancy formation energy substantially increases with temperature in all cases, which {{is related to}} the thermal lattice expansion. Such increase of the vacancy formation energy is compensated by the vibrational vacancy formation entropy contribution. The latter appears to be strongly increasing with temperature in the case of Mo. Conclusions. However, a thermodynamic analysis shows that such increase of vacancy formation energy in the process of calculation is largely underestimated. The latter is compensated by contribution from vibrating entropy of vacancy formation and strongly increases with temperature. Such underestimation is related to certain problems in quasi-harmonic approximation. ????????????. ?????????????? ?????? ????????? ?????????????? ??????? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ? ????????? ?????? ?????? ?? ??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ???????? ? ?????? ???? ???????. ??-??????, ??? ???????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ? ???????? ???????? ??????? ???????????? ????????. ??-??????, ???????????? ?????????????????? ?????? ????????? ????????????, ??? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ? ???????? ???????????? ???????? ?? ??????? ?? ???????????. ???? ????????????. ??????????? ??????? ??????? ??????????? ?? ????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ? ?? ??????????? ? ???? ???????? ? ???????? ??????????????????? ???????????. ???????? ??????????. ???????????? ?????????? ??????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ? ???????? ? ???

At low temperatures (T <= 400 K) and ethanol loading, a single ethanol molecule adsorbed in H-ZSM- 5 forms a Zundel-like structure where the proton is equally shared between the oxygen of the zeolite and the oxygen of the alcohol. At higher ethanol loading, a second ethanol molecule helps to stabilize the protonated ethanol at all temperatures by acting as a solvating agent.

The studied models are based on both flexible (q-TIP 4 P/F) and rigid (TIP 4 P/ 2005, TIP 4 PQ/ 2005) descriptions of the water molecule. Many aspects of the simulated phase diagrams are reasonably reproduced by the quasi-harmonic approximation. Advantages of this simple approach are that it is free from the statistical errors inherent to computer simulations, both classical and quantum limits are easily accessible, and the error of the approximation is expected to decrease in the zero temperature limit. We find that the calculated phase diagram of ice Ih, II, and III depends strongly on the hydrogen disorder of ice III, at least for cell sizes typically used in phase coexistence simulations. Either ice II (in the classical limit) or ice III (in the quantum one) may become unstable depending upon the proton disorder in ice III. The comparison of quantum and classical limits shows that the stabilization of ice II is the most important quantum effect in the phase diagram. The lower vibrational zero-point energy of ice II, compared to either ice Ih or III, is the microscopic origin of this stabilization. The necessity of performing an average of the lattice energy over the proton disorder of ice III is discussed. Comment: 14 pages, 11 figure...|$|E
40|$|Relaxor {{ferroelectric}} crystals {{are characterized}} by a broad region of critical fluctuations of polarization: the observed dielectric constants and elastic diffuse scattering extend over a wide region of temperatures and have unusual line shapes. Despite more than 50 years since the synthesis of the first relaxors, a satisfactory theory of relaxor ferroelectricity that accounts for this broad region of fluctuations remains elusive, {{partly because of the}} various energy scales: the deviation from Curie-Weiss law, the onset of the elastic diffuse scattering and the maximum in the dielectric susceptibility. We present a theory of the fluctuations of relaxors with a model of polarizable unit cells with dipolar forces, local anharmonic forces, and local random fields. The usual Lorentz field approximation to the local dipolar field fails to account for the critical fluctuations of polarization at any temperature since it violates the fluctuation-dissipation theorem of statistical mechanics. Thus, thermodynamic functions and temperature dependencies of the phonon frequencies are computed self-consistently using the Onsager field, which is the simplest necessary correction to the Lorentz field that guarantees the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Compositional disorder is treated by a self-consistent method that relates the local polarization to the local random fields and to the susceptibility averaged over compositional disorder. Local anharmonic forces are treated within <b>a</b> <b>quasi-harmonic</b> <b>approximation.</b> We find that (i) arbitrarily small compositional disorder together with dipolar forces extend the region of critical fluctuations down to absolute zero temperature; (ii) the correlation functions of polarization are highly anisotropic and slowly varying with a power law component.

40|$|The {{phase diagram}} of ice is studied by <b>a</b> <b>quasi-harmonic</b> <b>approximation.</b> The free energy of all {{experimentally}} known ice phases has been calculated with the flexible q-TIP 4 P/F model of water. The only {{exception is the}} high pressure ice X, in which the presence of symmetric O-H-O bonds prevents its modeling with this empirical interatomic potential. The simplicity of our approach allows us to study ice phases at state points of the T-P plane that have been omitted in previous simulations using free energy methods based on thermodynamic integration. The effect in the phase diagram of averaging the proton disorder that appears in several ice phases has been studied. It is found particularly relevant for ice III, at least for cell sizes typically used in phase coexistence simulations. New insight into the capability of the employed water model to describe the coexistence of ice phases is presented. We find that the H-ordered ices IX and XIV, {{as well as the}} H-disordered ice XII, are particularly stable for this water model. This fact disagrees with experimental data. The unexpected large stability of ice IX is a property related to the TIP 4 P-character of the water model. Only after omission of these three stable ice phases, the calculated phase diagram becomes in reasonable qualitative agreement to the experimental one in the T-P region corresponding to ice Ih, II, III, V, and VI. The calculation of the phase diagram in the quantum and classical limits shows that the most important quantum effect is the stabilization of ice II due to its lower zero-point energy when compared to that one of ices Ih, III, and V.

40|$|Theoretical {{studies of}} the ground state {{properties}} of the first-row transition metals (Sc to Zn) are conducted using the Stuttgart TB-LMTO ESC program. The standard deviation of the calculation precision errors (CPE's) and {{the magnitude of the}} systematic calculation errors (SCE's) in the output of the TB-LMTO ESC program are estimated. The ground state lattice parameters, local atomic magnetic moment magnitudes and bulk moduli of the first-row transition metals are calculated. Lattice parameters are found to be within 5 % to 10 % of experimental values, and magnetic moment magnitudes are found to be within 10 % to 20 % of experimental values. Bulk moduli are found to be within 60 % of experimental values. Lattice parameter and magnetic moment magnitude calculations are most accurate when the non-local exchange-correlation functional of Hu and Langreth is used. Bulk modulus calculations are most accurate when conducted using the exchange-correlation functional of Perdew and Yue. The TB-LMTO ESC program is also used to study the volume-controlled low-moment to high-moment (LM-HM) transition of the first-row transition metals (Sc to Ni) when they are constrained to take the FCC crystal structure. A LM-HM transition is predicted to occur in all FCC first-row transition metals if their lattice parameter is sufficiently increased. FCC Fe is found to occupy a unique position in the first-row transition metal series, as its LM-HM transition occurs when its lattice parameter is less than 2. 5 % larger than its ground state value. The LM-HM transition of the other FCC first-row transition metals occur when their lattice parameters are much larger or much smaller than their ground state values. It is argued that when the lattice parameters of the FCC first-row transition metals are too small, the energy bands of their valence electrons are too wide to allow magnetic moments to form within these metals. A method is proposed for calculating the Helmholtz' free energy of non-magnetic, bulk, crystalline solids consisting of a single chemical species. The method assumes only that an inter-atomic interaction potential can be derived from the minimum total energy versus lattice parameter curve of a solid using results published by Chen, Chen and Wei, and that this potential can accurately reproduce the energy increase that occurs when the atomic nuclei of the solid move away from their equilibrium positions as they undergo small amplitude thermal oscillations. The method is entirely theoretical as the minimum total energy versus lattice parameter curve of a solid can be calculated entirely from first principles using an ESC program. Within the method, the atomic nuclei of a solid are treated in <b>a</b> <b>quasi-harmonic</b> <b>approximation,</b> either as independent harmonic oscillators, or as coupled harmonic oscillators. The thermal expansion of metallic Cu is studied using the proposed method for calculating the Helmholtz' free energy of solids in conjunction with the TB-LMTO ESC program. The lattice parameter versus temperature curve of metallic Cu can be accurately calculated using the method, but its accuracy is sensitive to the functional form of the calculated minimum total energy versus lattice parameter curve of FCC Cu and to the range of the inter-atomic interaction potential. The results of these calculations suggest that the range of the inter-atomic interaction potential extends only to first nearest neighbour atomic nuclei in the metallic Cu solid. These results also suggest that the curvature of the minimum total energy versus lattice parameter curve of FCC Cu is most accurate when the curve is calculated using the exchange-correlation functional of Perdew and Yue even though the ground state lattice parameter of metallic Cu is most accurately predicted using the exchange-correlation functional of Hu and Langreth. However, it may be that imposing a short range to the inter-atomic interaction potential and that using the minimum total energy versus lattice parameter curve obtained with the exchange-correlation functional of Perdew and Yue simply better cancels the errors introduced in the calculation {{as a result of the}} quasi-harmonic approximation, as a result of not knowing the correct range of the inter-atomic interaction potential, and as a result of inaccuracies in the calculated minimum total energy versus lattice parameter curve of FCC Cu. Future research efforts should be focussed on the evaluation of the effect of these three factors on the accuracy of the method. We also recommend a direct evaluation of the accuracy of the energy increase that occurs when the atomic nuclei of the solid are displaced slightly from their equilibrium positions, as reproduced using the inter-atomic interaction potential constructed using the results of Chen, Chen and Wei...|$|E
