25|$|Not surprisingly, strikes {{increased}} steadily {{from the}} middle of 1915, and so did crime; but, for the most part, people suffered and endured, scouring the city for food. Working class women in St. Petersburg reportedly spent about forty hours a week in food lines, begging, turning to prostitution or crime, tearing down wooden fences to keep stoves heated for warmth, grumbling about the rich, and wondering when and how this would <b>all</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> an end.|$|E
25|$|Guillaume Tell might {{initially}} {{have been}} a failure but together with a work from the previous year, Auber's La muette de Portici, it ushered in a new genre which dominated the French stage {{for the rest of}} the century: grand opera. This was a style of opera characterised by grandiose scale, heroic and historical subjects, large casts, vast orchestras, richly detailed sets, sumptuous costumes, spectacular scenic effects and‚Äì this being France‚Äì a great deal of ballet music. Grand opera had already been prefigured by works such as Spontini's La vestale and Cherubini's Les Abenc√©rages (1813), but the composer history has above <b>all</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> associate with the genre is Giacomo Meyerbeer. Like Gluck, Meyerbeer was a German who had learnt his trade composing Italian opera before arriving in Paris. His first work for the Op√©ra, Robert le diable (1831), was a sensation; audiences particularly thrilled to the ballet sequence in Act Three in which the ghosts of corrupted nuns rise from their graves. Robert, together with Meyerbeer's three subsequent grand operas, Les Huguenots (1836), Le proph√®te (1849) and L'Africaine (1865), became part of the repertoire throughout Europe {{for the rest of the}} nineteenth century and exerted an immense influence on other composers, even though the musical merit of these extravagant works was often disputed. In fact, the most famous example of French grand opera likely to be encountered in opera houses today is by Giuseppe Verdi, who wrote Don Carlos for the Paris Op√©ra in 1867.|$|E

500|$|The Swedish {{director}} Ingmar Bergman {{called his}} own film The Virgin Spring [...] "touristic, a lousy imitation of Kurosawa", and added, [...] "At that time my {{admiration for the}} Japanese cinema was at its height. I was almost a samurai myself!" [...] In Italy, Federico Fellini in an interview declared the director [...] "the greatest living example of all that an author of the cinema should be"‚Äîdespite admitting to having seen only one of his films, Seven Samurai. In France, Roman Polanski in 1965 cited Kurosawa {{as one of his}} three favorite filmmakers (with Fellini and Orson Welles), singling out Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood and The Hidden Fortress for praise. The Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci considered the Japanese master's influence to be seminal: [...] "Kurosawa's movies and La Dolce Vita of Fellini are the things that pushed me, sucked me into being a film director." [...] German New Wave director Werner Herzog has cited Kurosawa as one of his greatest influences: [...] "Of the filmmakers with whom I feel some kinship, Griffith... Bu√±uel, Kurosawa and Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible, <b>all</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> mind." [...] When asked to list his favorite directors, Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky cited Kurosawa as one of his favorites and named Seven Samurai as one of his ten favorite films.|$|E
500|$|USA Today critic Claudia Puig {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, praising it {{for its ability}} to blend [...] "a childlike sense of wonder with sophisticated emotions and motives". Helen McCarthy in 500 Essential Anime Movies said that the natural world was [...] "beautifully represented", with [...] "some absolutely breathtaking mountains and lakeside landscapes". She also praised the design of the Castle and added that Miyazaki added his own themes to the film: [...] "man's relationship to nature, the futility of war, and the joy of flight". Joel Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal called the film [...] "a moveable feast of delights". Richard Corliss of TIME magazine wrote, [...] "Palaces and shimmering lakes, warplanes and fire sprites <b>all</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> life at the breath of Miyazaki's graphic genius." [...] Writing for The Boston Globe, Ty Burr said, [...] "At its best, 'Howl's Moving Castle' offers a rich fantasy of adolescent escape, of romance in the old and epic sense. At its worst, it's the most amazing 12-course meal you can't bring yourself to finish." [...] A.O. Scott of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Admirers of [...] work, which is wildly imaginative, emotionally intense and surpassingly gentle, will find much to appreciate in this film because it demonstrates, once again, his visual ingenuity and his sensitivity as a storyteller. For newcomers to his world, [...] "Howl's Moving Castle" [...] is a fitting introduction to one of modern cinema's great enchanters." ...|$|E

[...] In a {{separate}} piece Montgomery added that [...] "... she may have finally reached the point in her career where not even she can top herself." [...] Rolling Stones Daniel Kreps called the video a [...] "cinematic epic." [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly, liked the video; however, {{he had no idea}} what was going on: [...] "I can‚Äôt wait to hear Lady Gaga explain her latest video, ‚ÄúAlejandro.‚Äù Mostly because after watching it (twice!), I have absolutely no clue what‚Äôs going on beyond the obvious." [...] Anthony Benigno from Daily News felt that [...] "the shock songstress' new music video [...] is chock full of bed-ridden S imagery that makes it look like the softcore answer to The Matrix. Randall Roberts from Los Angeles Times said [...] "the clip reinforces the notion that no one understands the convergence of image and music right now better than Gaga." [...] Jed Gottlieb from the Boston Herald said that [...] "The plot [...] is hard to decipher, but it‚Äôs clearly not a story that ends happily ever after." [...] Jen Dose from National Post commented [...] "Gaga‚Äôs new vid for 'Alejandro' certainly brings the crazy we‚Äôve <b>all</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> expect from her. It‚Äôs like an 8+ minute homage to Madonna‚Äîwith some gay Nazis thrown in for good measure". Amy Odell of New York said the video's outfits were not as [...] "intense" [...] as those of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] or [...] "Telephone." [...] Nate Jones of Time Magazine disliked the song, but felt the video [...] "looks fantastic... the self-conscious ballsiness of Gaga and director Steven Klein works here." [...] Jennifer Cady from E! liked the video, but did not think it was as good as Gaga's previous work. Julie Moult from Daily Mail said [...] ", no-one could accuse Lady Gaga of being the shy and retiring type." ...|$|E

Nonetheless, the Tinsleys emphasised that his departure from their household had been upon amicable terms, and also confirmed that in the short space of time Hudson had lodged in their household, he had been popular with their seven children, who had <b>all</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> know him as [...] "Uncle Fred".|$|E

Ch√°vez later lived with his grandmother, whose father was Jewish, and rose through school to obtain entry into the Venezuelan Academy of Military Sciences as a cadet. In his college years, Ch√°vez began associating with leftists and gained {{exposure}} to various Latin American populist leaders‚Äîincluding Juan Velasco Alvarado and Omar Torrijos. Meanwhile, he developed a critical perspective on South America's socio-political context. These influences led Ch√°vez to incorporate both nationalist and socialist elements in a new political ideology that he would dub [...] "Bolivarianism". These would <b>all</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> bear upon Ch√°vez's thinking, eventually stoking plans for a 1992 coup d'√©tat, seeking the overthrow of Venezuela's government.|$|E

[...] Maximum stated [...] "We have no hesitation in recommending this to all adventure fanatics, though inexperienced adventurers may want to wet their feet with something a little less taxing the first time out." [...] Roberts concluded his review by saying, [...] "The Dig is the kind of adventure we've <b>all</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> expect from LucasArts.

The same year, California deathrock band Kommunity FK toured with UK gothic rock band Sex Gang Children (and the following year with Alien Sex Fiend) which continued the trend in which American and British movements intermixed.
