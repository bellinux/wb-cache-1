5|$|Research in {{the field}} of <b>addiction</b> {{medicine}} has also recently turned its focus to LTP, owing to the hypothesis that drug <b>addiction</b> represents a powerful form of learning and memory. <b>Addiction</b> is a complex neurobehavioral phenomenon involving various parts of the brain, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Studies have demonstrated that VTA and NAc synapses are capable of undergoing LTP and that this LTP may be responsible for the behaviors that characterize <b>addiction.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{risks of}} {{behavioral}} <b>addictions</b> are well documented. There are biological, medical, social, spiritual, psychological, and safety {{risks to the}} individual as well as risks, like ripple effects, to the family and friends with whom the individual with behavioral <b>addictions</b> lives. The phenomenon of collateral damage from <b>addictions,</b> especially alcoholism and substance dependence, is well documented. Aims and methods: A selected {{review of the literature}} reveals little regarding the risks of collateral damage, in particular codependence, from behavioral <b>addictions</b> on non-addicted family and friends. Results: This article theoretically posits the existence of codependence to those with two well documented and researched behavioral <b>addictions,</b> hypersexual and gambling disorder, using the biopsychosocial lens. Conclusions: <b>Addictions</b> professionals are encouraged to revisit the literature on codependence and consider its influence on family and friends of those with behavioral <b>addictions</b> when providing services. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeDespite {{significant}} {{advances in}} our understanding of the biological bases of <b>addictions,</b> these disorders continue to represent a huge public health burden that is associated with substantial personal suffering. Efforts to target <b>addictions</b> require consideration of how the improved biological understanding of <b>addictions</b> may lead to improved prevention, treatment, and policy initiatives. MethodIn this article, we provide a narrative review of current biological models for <b>addictions</b> with a goal of placing existing data and theories within a translational and developmental framework targeting the advancement of prevention, treatment, and policy strategies. ResultsData regarding individual differences, intermediary phenotypes, and main and interactive influences of genetic and environmental contributions in the setting of developmental trajectories that may be influenced by addictive drugs or behavior indicate complex underpinnings of <b>addictions.</b> ConclusionsConsideration and further elucidation of the biological etiologies of <b>addictions</b> hold significant potential for making important gains and reducing the public health impact of <b>addictions...</b>|$|R

After Cuddy makes a bet to prove House's <b>addiction</b> to Vicodin, House concedes to Wilson {{that he has}} an <b>addiction</b> but says that the <b>addiction</b> is not a problem. It is, in fact, Wilson who usually writes House's Vicodin prescriptions (with Cuddy writing a few merely for leverage in her dealings with House). In Season 3, when Detective Michael Tritter (David Morse) threatens to jail House for his Vicodin <b>addiction</b> after finding a huge stash in his apartment, Wilson {{attempts to}} convince House to go to rehab as the situation worsens. After Tritter pressures Wilson to testify several times, Wilson reluctantly agrees, unknown to House.

5|$|Dopaminergic {{medications}} {{that are used}} to treat Parkinson's disease are sometimes associated with the development of a dopamine dysregulation syndrome, which involves the overuse of dopaminergic medication and medication-induced compulsive engagement in natural rewards like gambling and sexual activity.

40|$|The {{model of}} <b>addictions</b> was {{changing}} over time. Previously, addctions were understood {{according to a}} single pharmacological model based on the phenomena of tolerance and pharmaco-dependence induced by drugs like alcohol and opiates. Today, our understanding of <b>addictions</b> moved to a progressive dysregulation of brain regions called "reward system", inducing progressively major behavioral modifications. This concept is integrated into the bio-psycho-social model of <b>addictions</b> and of their treatment. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
50|$|Also {{offered to}} {{patients}} are one-on-one counseling sessions and cognitive behavioral therapy(CBT). When looked at through a cognitive-behavioral perspective, <b>addictions</b> {{are the result}} of learned behaviors developed through positive experiences. In other words, when an individual uses a drug and receives desired results (happiness, reduced stress, etc.) it may become the preferred way of attaining those results, leading to <b>addictions.</b> The goal of CBT is to identify the needs that the <b>addictions</b> are being used to meet and to develop skills and alternative ways of meeting those needs. The therapist will work with the patient to educate them on their <b>addictions</b> and give them the skills they need to change their cognition's and behaviors.Addicts will learn to identify and correct problematic behavior. They will be taught how to identify harmful thoughts and drug cravings. CBT is an effective treatment for <b>addictions.</b>|$|R

5|$|Drug use and overdoses {{increased}} {{significantly in the}} 1800s due to the commercialization and availability of certain drugs.
