25|$|Privatization {{works when}} the person who owns the {{property}} (or rights of access to that property) pays the full price of its exploitation. As discussed above negative externalities (negative results, such as air or water pollution, that do not proportionately affect the user of the resource) is often a feature driving {{the tragedy of the}} commons. Internalizing the externalities, in other words ensuring that the users of resource pay for all of the consequences of its use, can provide an <b>alternate</b> <b>solution</b> between privatization and regulation. One example is gasoline taxes which are intended to include both the cost of road maintenance and of air pollution. This solution can provide the flexibility of privatization while minimizing the amount of government oversight and overhead that is needed.|$|E
25|$|The Norden bombsight was {{developed}} {{during a period}} of United States non-interventionism when the dominant U.S. military strategy was the defense of the U.S. and its possessions. A considerable amount of this strategy was based on stopping attempted invasions by sea, both with direct naval power, and starting in the 1930s, with USAAC airpower. Most air forces of the era invested heavily in dive bombers or torpedo bombers for these roles, but these aircraft generally had limited range; long-range strategic reach would require the use of an aircraft carrier. The Army felt the combination of the Norden and B-17 Flying Fortress presented an <b>alternate</b> <b>solution,</b> believing that small formations of B-17s could successfully attack shipping at long distances from the USAAC's widespread bases. The high altitudes the Norden allowed would help increase the range of the aircraft, especially if equipped with a turbocharger, as with each of the four Wright Cyclone 9 radial engines of the B-17.|$|E
500|$|At {{multiple}} points {{within the}} game, Adam partakes {{in conversations with}} NPCs related to main and side quests. When talking, Adam is presented with three different conversation options that affect the outcome of conversations: choosing the right option can help with completing objectives while choosing the wrong option closes off that route and forces the player to find an <b>alternate</b> <b>solution.</b> A [...] "Social" [...] augmentation enables better reading of an NPC's expression and judging their psychological profile, improving chances of selecting the right dialogue option. While in the game's environments, Adam finds terminals and computers that can be accessed either with a password or through hacking. When hacking, the hacking screen is summoned, which shows the pathway through a device's security system to access the information: the pathway is accessed by opening [...] "directory" [...] nodes to reach the registry. Different nodes have different ratings, affecting how easily they can be accessed. Various devices have different grades of difficulty, which in turn dictate how many times hacking may be attempted. Each hacking attempt activates a Diagnostic Sub-Routine which works to stop the hack, activating a time limit once it is alerted. Adam can use additional skills and items to lengthen the time, such as software to stop or instantly capture nodes or fortify captured nodes to increase the time limit. Successful hacks yield experience points, Credits, and sometimes additional items.|$|E

2500|$|WYAB {{originally}} {{began as}} WAZF-FM in 1984 as a vacant allotment in the FCC's Table of Allotments, {{which is essentially}} a community-by-community listing of all radio station channels and classes within the United States and its territories. The initial allotment was for a 3,000 watt station to broadcast on 93.7 FM to serve Yazoo City. The allotment was created by a company known as Dri-Two, Inc. {{to serve as a}} [...] "sister" [...] FM station to the now silent WAZF 1230 AM, also licensed to Yazoo City. [...] The vacant allotment sat without an actual broadcast station occupying its place from 1984 until 1995, when Mississippi College, license holder of WHJT 93.5 FM, petitioned the FCC to have the allotment removed from the Table. The college intended to upgrade the facilities of WHJT in nearby Clinton from 3,000 watts to 6,000 watts, something that could not have been accomplished with interference from a potential station on 93.7 FM in Yazoo City. After some public interest in the retaining the allotment at Yazoo City, the FCC developed an <b>alternate</b> <b>solution</b> that could accommodate all parties. The FCC moved the vacant allotment from 93.7 FM to 93.1 FM and granted the WHJT upgrade.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{financial}} year 2012–13, {{the production of}} crude oil is 37.86 million tons and 40,679 million standard cubic meters (nearly 26.85 million tons) natural gas. The net import of crude oil [...] & petroleum products is 146.70 million tons worth of Rs 5611.40 billions. This includes 9.534 million tons of LNG imports worth of Rs. 282.15 billions. Internationally, LNG price [...] (One mmBtu of LNG = 0.1724 barrels of crude oil (boe) = 24.36 cubic meters of natural gas = 29.2 litres diesel = 21.3 kg LPG) is fixed below crude oil price in terms of heating value. LNG is slowly gaining its role as direct use fuel in road [...] and marine transport without regasification. By the end of June 2016, LNG price has fallen by nearly 50% below its oil parity price making it more economical fuel than diesel/gas oil in transport sector. [...] In 2012-13, India consumed 15.744 million tons petrol and 69.179 million tons diesel which are mainly produced from imported crude oil at huge foreign exchange out go. Use of natural gas [...] for heating, cooking and electricity generation is not economical {{as more and more}} locally produced natural gas will be converted into LNG for use in transport sector to reduce crude oil imports. In addition to the conventional natural gas production, coal gasification, coal bed methane, coal mine methane and Biogas digesters / Renewable natural gas will also become source of LNG forming decentralised base for production of LNG to cater to the widely distributed demand. There is possibility to convert most of the heavy duty vehicles [...] (including diesel driven rail engines) into [...] LNG fuelled vehicles to reduce diesel consumption drastically with operational cost and least pollution benefits. Also, the break even price at user end for switching from imported coal to LNG in electricity generation is estimated near 6 US$/mmBtu. The advent of cheaper marine CNG transport will restrict LNG use in high end transport sector to replace costly liquid fuels leaving imported CNG use for other needs. As the marine CNG transport is economical for medium distance transport and has fast unloading flexibility at many ports without costly unloading facilities, they have become <b>alternate</b> <b>solution</b> to submarine gas pipelines.|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of a performance based approach to building regulations in 1996 with Australia marked a watershed {{in the way in}} which applications for building permits were determined. Rather than a wholesale reliance on a deemed to satisfy approach whereby designers demonstrated compliance via a fairly narrow selection of ways in which the building would achieve the minimum standards set out in the Building Code of Australia, the new approach allowed designers to submit <b>alternate</b> <b>solutions.</b> The aim was to encourage innovation and use of alternate materials and designs in buildings. However the submission of <b>alternate</b> <b>solutions</b> also involved the analysis of complex calculation especially with regards to structural matters and fire safety. The building profession in Australia has largely been comprised of tradesmen who have supplemented their work experience with education to become building surveyors. There are concerns that the profession is unable to deal with the complex <b>alternate</b> <b>solutions</b> submitted under the new system, so much so that some say the profession is now at a crossroads.
