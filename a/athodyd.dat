[...] First Reinke and then Clark failed to correctly spell [...] "spinnaker" [...] {{near the end of}} the contest, giving Reinke another chance to win.|$|E
5000|$|A ramjet, {{sometimes}} referred to as a flying stovepipe or an <b>athodyd</b> (an abbreviation of aero thermodynamic duct), is a form of airbreathing jet engine that uses the engine's forward motion to compress incoming air without an axial compressor. Because ramjets cannot produce thrust at zero airspeed, they cannot move an aircraft from a standstill. A ramjet-powered vehicle, therefore, requires an assisted take-off like a rocket assist to accelerate it to a speed where it begins to produce thrust. Ramjets work most efficiently at supersonic speeds around [...] This type of engine can operate up to speeds of [...]|$|E
5000|$|The W.2B/700 {{was to be}} used in the Miles M.52 {{supersonic}} research aircraft. In {{order to}} achieve the thrust required for supersonic flight, a version of the engine was developed using a turbine-driven [...] "augmenter" [...] ducted fan (an early form of turbofan). The NO.4 augmenter was mounted behind the engine, drawing fresh air through ducts surrounding the engine. Power was boosted even further by supplying the air to the world's first [...] "reheat jetpipe" [...] or afterburner which was actually a very early <b>athodyd</b> or ramjet. The hope was that this combination of the W.2/700, turbofan augmenter and re-heat/ramjet would produce the required power for the proposed 1,000 mph aircraft.|$|E
40|$|Heat energy can be {{converted}} into mechanical energy only by the expansion of a high temperature high pressure gas to a lower pressure thus changing the random energy, temperature, into a directed energy associated with a velocity. One of the simplest methods of achieving the necessary pressure for this expansion is by utilizing the high velocity of the airstream relative to a rapidly moving aircraft. The momentum of this airstream is converted into pressure by deceleration in a diffuser. The air is then heated and ejected as a high speed jet, producing thrust, hence the name given to this system is ramjet. Other names have also been proposed such as <b>athodyd,</b> which is a contraction of aero-thermodynamic duct. The {{purpose of this study}} is to derive a simple ramjet theory and to use this theory in setting up dimensionless parameters and methods of analysing experimental data. No attempt is made to devise experimental techniques but only to give a method by which the experimental data may be correlated. It is found that the performance of a ramjet at any altitude can be reduced to an equivalent sea level condition by the application of suitable correction factors. These factors are derived on the basis of constant flight Mach number, constant ramjet geometrical arrangement, and constant throttle setting. This latter parameter is most accurately described by the ratio of the combustion chamber temperature to the free air temperature. It is recommended that ramjet test data be corrected to this standard sea level condition for ease of correlation and analysis...|$|E
