5|$|Alongside {{the growth}} of brain size, total brain {{ganglioside}} concentration <b>also</b> <b>increases</b> 3-fold from early fetal development to 5 years of age.|$|E
5|$|Systemin <b>also</b> <b>increases</b> root {{growth in}} Solanum pimpinellifolium {{suggesting}} that it may also play some role in plant development.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{polyclonal}} response confers advantages on {{the immune}} system, in particular, greater probability of reacting against pathogens, it <b>also</b> <b>increases</b> chances of developing certain autoimmune diseases {{resulting from the}} reaction of the immune system against native molecules produced within the host.|$|E
50|$|Tolkien-related games, {{especially}} {{computer and}} video games have <b>also</b> <b>increased</b> in number and in popularity. Popular culture references to Middle-earth have <b>also</b> <b>increased,</b> as well as satires and parodies of it.|$|R
50|$|International trade <b>also</b> <b>increased</b> dramatically, {{reflecting}} the growing degree of openness of the country. Imports increased from US$11.6 billion in 1991 to US$32.3 billion in 2000. Likewise, exports <b>also</b> <b>increased</b> from US$12.1 billion in 1991 to US$30.7 billion in 2000.|$|R
50|$|Police patrols were <b>also</b> <b>increased</b> in Finland's capital Helsinki.|$|R
5|$|As {{described}} earlier, prevailing {{and local}} winds are not spread evenly across the earth, {{which means that}} wind speeds also differ by region. In addition, the wind speed <b>also</b> <b>increases</b> with the altitude.|$|E
5|$|Exercise <b>also</b> <b>increases</b> the {{respiratory}} rate, partly {{in response to}} the movement of the limbs detected by proprioceptors in the muscles and joints, an increase in body temperature, the release of adrenaline (epinephrine) from the adrenal glands, and from motor impulses originating from the cerebral cortex.|$|E
5|$|Other {{materials}} are often {{added to the}} iron/carbon mixture to produce steel with desired properties. Nickel and manganese in steel add to its tensile strength and make the austenite form of the iron-carbon solution more stable, chromium increases hardness and melting temperature, and vanadium <b>also</b> <b>increases</b> hardness while making it less prone to metal fatigue.|$|E
25|$|This gave Fulmer {{opportunities}} for collaboration but <b>also</b> <b>increased</b> competition.|$|R
2500|$|Nadolol may <b>also</b> <b>increase</b> plasma {{triglycerides}} {{and decrease}} HDL-cholesterol levels.|$|R
5000|$|Brown lenses {{cause some}} color distortion, but <b>also</b> <b>increase</b> contrast.|$|R
5|$|Speeders have a boost meter, {{showing how}} much fuel is {{available}} for the onboard speed boost. Although the boost provides greater speeds and acceleration than the standard throttle, it <b>also</b> <b>increases</b> the speeder's heat levels. Designated booster load zones along the track replenish the meter, and a super boost power-up is available which doubles the potency of the boost.|$|E
5|$|Sperm {{competition}} and chemicals introduced to females through mating {{have a negative}} effect on females and their lifespan. In males, production of the spermatophore, sperm, and secondary chemicals reduces their lifespan. As the number of copulations increase, the rate of mortality <b>also</b> <b>increases</b> in both sexes.|$|E
5|$|The rate {{of obesity}} <b>also</b> <b>increases</b> with age at least up to 50 or 60years old and severe obesity in the United States, Australia, and Canada is {{increasing}} {{faster than the}} overall rate of obesity.|$|E
5000|$|Nadolol may <b>also</b> <b>increase</b> plasma {{triglycerides}} {{and decrease}} HDL-cholesterol levels.|$|R
25|$|The {{amount of}} action is <b>also</b> <b>increased</b> by a small amount.|$|R
50|$|By extension, {{parents with}} the fewest {{offspring}} will <b>also</b> <b>increase</b> in frequency.|$|R
5|$|Venous {{thrombosis}} {{may also}} occur in more unusual places: in the veins of the brain, liver (portal vein thrombosis and hepatic vein thrombosis), mesenteric vein, kidney (renal vein thrombosis) and the veins of the arms. Whether thrombophilia <b>also</b> <b>increases</b> {{the risk of}} arterial thrombosis (which is the underlying cause of heart attacks and strokes) is less well established.|$|E
5|$|De-icers spray heated {{de-icing}} fluid, often {{propylene glycol}} or ethylene glycol, onto icy surfaces {{such as the}} bodies of aircraft and road surfaces. These prevent ice from forming {{on the body of}} the aircraft while on the ground. Ice makes the surface of the wings rougher, reducing the amount of lift they provide while increasing drag. The ice <b>also</b> <b>increases</b> the weight of the aircraft and can affect its balance.|$|E
5|$|High {{levels of}} {{molybdenum}} {{can interfere with}} the body's uptake of copper, producing copper deficiency. Molybdenum prevents plasma proteins from binding to copper, and it <b>also</b> <b>increases</b> the amount of copper that is excreted in urine. Ruminants that consume high levels of molybdenum suffer from diarrhea, stunted growth, anemia, and achromotrichia (loss of fur pigment). These symptoms can be alleviated by copper supplements, either dietary and injection. The effective copper deficiency, can be aggravated by excess sulfur.|$|E
50|$|Childhook leukemia {{rates have}} {{increased}} substantially. Cancer rates have <b>also</b> <b>increased</b> overall.|$|R
50|$|Population: If the {{population}} grows {{this means that}} demand will <b>also</b> <b>increase.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{number of}} {{temporary}} judges was <b>also</b> <b>increased</b> from nine to twelve.|$|R
5|$|Most Solar {{parks are}} ground mounted PV systems, {{also known as}} {{free-field}} solar power plants. They can either be fixed tilt or use a single axis or dual axis solar tracker. While tracking improves the overall performance, it <b>also</b> <b>increases</b> the system's installation and maintenance cost. A solar inverter converts the array's power output from DC to AC, and connection to the utility grid is made through a high voltage, three phase step up transformer of typically 10kV and above.|$|E
5|$|Since most {{toothache}} is {{the result}} of plaque-related diseases, such as tooth decay and periodontal disease, the majority of cases could be prevented by avoidance of a cariogenic diet and maintenance of good oral hygiene. That is, reduction in the number times that refined sugars are consumed per day and brushing the teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and flossing. Regular visits to a dentist <b>also</b> <b>increases</b> the likelihood that problems are detected early and averted before toothache occurs. Dental trauma could also be significantly reduced by routine use of mouthguards in contact sports.|$|E
5|$|Some {{risk factors}} {{influence}} {{the location of}} DVT within the body. In isolated distal DVT, the profile of risk factors appears distinct from proximal DVT. Transient factors, such as surgery and immobilization, appear to dominate, whereas thrombophilias and age {{do not seem to}} increase risk. In upper-extremity DVT, the most important risk factor is having a central venous catheter, and thoracic outlet syndrome <b>also</b> <b>increases</b> risk.|$|E
25|$|Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a {{synthetic}} form of estrogen. It {{has been used}} between the early 1940s and 1971. Pregnant women took DES to prevent certain pregnancy complications. However, it <b>also</b> <b>increased</b> their risk of breast cancer. It <b>also</b> <b>increased</b> {{the risk of breast}} cancer in the prenatally exposed daughters after they have reached an age 40 years.|$|R
25|$|Maintaining UV {{ornamentation}} {{and size}} dimorphism of some jumping spiders may seem strictly beneficial to sexual selection, {{yet there are}} costs to maintain such distinguishing characteristics. While UV reflecting individuals may attract more female spiders, it can <b>also</b> <b>increase</b> the risk of predation. Similarly, larger body size can be costly, as it may <b>also</b> <b>increase</b> the risk of predation.|$|R

5|$|The drug {{strontium}} ranelate aids bone growth, increases bone density, and {{lessen the}} incidence of vertebral, peripheral, and hip fractures. However, strontium ranelate <b>also</b> <b>increases</b> the risk of venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism and serious cardiovascular disorders, including myocardial infarction. Its use is therefore now restricted. Its beneficial effects are also questionable, since the increased bone density is partially caused by the increased density of strontium over the calcium which it replaces. Strontium also bioaccumulates in the body.|$|E
5|$|The thin {{skin of the}} octopus absorbs {{additional}} oxygen. When resting, around 41% of an octopus's oxygen absorption {{is through}} the skin. This decreases to 33% when it swims, as more water flows over the gills; skin oxygen uptake <b>also</b> <b>increases.</b> When it is resting after a meal, absorption through the skin can drop to 3% of its total oxygen uptake.|$|E
5|$|Twenty {{percent of}} modern {{pharmaceuticals}} contain fluorine. One of these, the cholesterol-reducer atorvastatin (Lipitor), made more revenue {{than any other}} drug until it became generic in 2011. The combination asthma prescription Seretide, a top-ten revenue drug in the mid-2000s, contains two active ingredients, one of which – fluticasone – is fluorinated. Many drugs are fluorinated to delay inactivation and lengthen dosage periods because the carbon–fluorine bond is very stable. Fluorination <b>also</b> <b>increases</b> lipophilicity because the bond is more hydrophobic than the carbon–hydrogen bond, and this often helps in cell membrane penetration and hence bioavailability.|$|E
