During the next four years he photographed fifteen silent films, of which twelve starred Dix, and he shot <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the twenty-nine pictures Dix made between 1927 and 1933. In addition, in 1927 Cronjager joined the American Society of Cinematographers (ASC).|$|E

During the first two Tests, <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his moves succeeded instantly... No doubt, Allen had studied his opponents carefully and knew their weaknesses, and if his tactics were not always dictated by accepted principles they certainly proved very successful. Those who attributed {{so much of the}} England captain's success to good luck were inclined to overlook the many stratagems exploited by him". In the Test series, he scored 150 runs at 18.75 and took 17 wickets at 30.94. During the tour, Allen struck up a friendship with Bradman and encouraged his team to fraternise with the Australian team. He clashed over tactics with one of his team, Joe Hardstaff; the pair never got along thereafter.|$|E

The reviewer for The Manchester Guardian {{was impressed with the}} film, and wrote that [...] "there is a new neatness of execution and lightness of touch about this production... while George himself can no longer be accused of trailing clouds of vaudevillian glory". The reviewer also considered Formby [...] "our first authentic and strictly indigenous film comedian". After completing filming, the Formbys undertook a further ENSA tour. Although Dean personally disliked the Formbys, he greatly admired the tireless work they did for the organisation. In August Formby undertook a 53-day tour in {{a significant portion of the}} Mediterranean, including Italy, Sicily, Malta, Gibraltar, Libya, Tunisia, Egypt, Lebanon and Palestine; visiting 750,000 troops in thirteen countries, touring [...] in the process and returning to England in October.

[...] It was here that [...] "Lili Marlene", the song broadcast from Radio Belgrade and which he had listened to night after night, from the desert to the mountain tops, finally ceased. [...] "Not long now," [...] he thought. The Partisan troops travelled through Arandjelovac and soon met up with the Red Army, who were being hailed as liberators. [...] Maclean noted that <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them was a fighting soldier, and that their vehicles carried nothing but petrol and ammunition. For the rest, he presumed, they got from the enemy or the local people. [...] "We were witnessing a return to the administrative methods of Attila and Genghis Khan, and the results seemed to deserve careful attention." [...] In the last ten miles outside the capital, they passed hundreds and hundreds of corpses from the recent battle, and a neat stack of a hundred or more who appeared to have been executed. [...] When they reached the HQ of General Peko Dapčević, his chief of staff, who had only a vague notion of the geography of the city, took Maclean and Vivian Street out for a tour, through heavy shelling that he appeared oblivious to. [...] From the terrace of the Kalemegdan, the ancient fort {{in the middle of the}} city, they witnessed the withdrawal of German troops over the Danube to the suburb of Zemun. [...] Inexplicably, the Germans failed to blow up the bridge after the last of their troops were over it, allowing the Russians to follow only minutes behind. [...] Maclean, some time afterwards, found out the answer to this puzzle, comparing it to a fairytale. [...] An old schoolmaster, whose one experience of modern warfare was in the Balkan War of 1912, saw the charges being laid and knew how to disconnect them. He got a gold medal in 1912 and another for this initiative too.|$|E

In this article, I present the thoughts of selected novice history teachers (who have been in service for at most 3 years) in relation to making moral judgments about the past in the classroom. The teachers identify the historical themes that they have considered making moral judgments about. They also explain the approaches that they have contemplated in this challenge. I then utilise Wineburg’s (2001) framework on moral ambiguity to explain the implications of the teachers’ views. I conclude that while South Africa’s history is flooded with moral references that make it almost impossible to avoid making judgments, the history teacher needs a usable framework that they can rely on for teaching all contentious issues...|$|R
