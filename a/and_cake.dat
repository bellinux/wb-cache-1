5|$|I {{found they}} begin the festivities of Christmas by a curious procession: {{a party of}} young people procure {{the head of a}} dead horse, which is affixed to a pole about four feet in length; a string is affixed to the lower jaw; a horse-cloth is also {{attached}} to the whole, under which one of the parts gets, and by frequently pulling the string, keeps up a loud snapping noise, and is accompanied {{by the rest of the}} party, grotesquely habited, with hand-bells; they thus proceed from house to house, ringing their bells, and singing carols and songs; they are commonly gratified with beer <b>and</b> <b>cake,</b> or perhaps with money. This is called, provincially, a Hodening.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Herren {{signed to}} the British label Warp under two aliases, Prefuse 73 and Savath & Savalas, after Warp staff {{had heard a}} {{previous}} record of Herren's which had sparked their interest in his work. Herren {{was familiar with the}} label through artists Aphex Twin and Boards of Canada, but chose to sign to Warp as he was a fan of the group Broadcast who had released an EP through the label. Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives features rapping from Mikah 9, Aesop Rock and MF Doom, and vocals from Sam Prekop of the indie rock band the Sea <b>and</b> <b>Cake.</b> The vocalists did not work directly with Herren, but sent him audio tapes of their own vocal recordings. Herren later commented on having Prekop sing on the album, noting that having an indie rock artist on the album was his way of trying to get his sound out to a new audience.|$|E

5|$|In 1915, the Corporation {{had made}} {{enquiries}} about purchasing a second-hand steam engine, approaching six locomotive manufacturers, but eventually acquired a new 0-4-0 saddle tank from Peckett and Sons Ltd, {{which was built}} at their Bristol works in 1918. The original engine became a spare, but was hired out to the Blackburn Meadows power station in March 1936. A year later it was condemned by the insurance company, and was sold for scrap to Maden and McKee Ltd, who were based in Liverpool. A replacement was sought, and a third 0-4-0 saddle tank, made by Hudswell Clarke in 1914, was bought from the Olympia Oil <b>and</b> <b>Cake</b> Company at Selby. It was coupled into a goods train, and arrived at the works in July 1937. At the works, as at Selby, it carried the name Olympia, painted on the tanks. The Peckett was overhauled by the Yorkshire Engine Company at Meadow Hall Works between 1945 and 1946. Because there was a statutory obligation to keep the treatment works operational, a special dispensation was obtained during the 1926 general strike, to allow this engine to run over the main line, delivering wagons to Kilnhurst tip. Kilnhurst tip eventually became full, and in January 1948, regular tipping operations ceased, after a new tip at Thrybergh opened. Tipping continued at Kilnhurst sporadically, until it was closed in 1959. During its operational life up to 1948, 2,917,480 tons of sewage sludge was dumped at the site, and following closure, it was sold to the National Coal Board in 1961.|$|E

25|$|A Coast Guard {{investigation}} concluded several {{facts about}} the Marine Sulphur Queen which, by themselves, should have prevented the ship from going to sea at all. The most important were the incidents of fire beneath and {{along the sides of}} the four large sulphur tanks; according to former crewmen these fires were so common that ship's officers gave up sounding the fire alarm. On one occasion the ship sailed into a New Jersey harbor, off-loaded cargo, and sailed out with a fire still burning. When a fire was actually put out, the sulphur would puddle <b>and</b> <b>cake</b> around equipment, once shorting out a major electrical generator. Caked sulphur was also found in spaces below the tanks, due to many cracks in the structure.|$|E
