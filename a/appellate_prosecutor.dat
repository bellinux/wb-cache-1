50|$|Depending {{on state}} law, appeals are moved to appellate courts (also called appeals courts, courts of appeals, {{superior}} courts, or supreme courts in some states). During the appeals process State's Attorneys, in many cases, hands all relative prosecutorial materials to a State <b>Appellate</b> <b>Prosecutor</b> {{who in turn}} will represent the state in appellate courts with the advice and consent of the State's Attorney. The State's Attorney in small counties is responsible for grand jury indictments, motions, proceedings, and trying cases by jury or bench until verdict. In larger counties, the State's Attorney acts as an administrator and delegates most of the trial work to Assistant State's Attorney or Assistant District Attorneys.|$|E

500|$|However, {{later that}} month Bulgarian environmentalists {{stated that the}} bat {{population}} in the cave had been reduced by up to 75% (from about 30,000 in 2010 to 8,000 in 2011). Nikolay Simov of the Center for Bat Studies and Protection at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences blamed The Expendables 2s production for the reduction. On January 16, 2012, the Veliko Tarnovo <b>Appellate</b> <b>Prosecutor's</b> Office overturned a ruling by its Lovech equivalent to prevent an investigation of what environmentalists stated to be an [...] "excessive" [...] number of dead bats found in the cave after filming (including several endangered species). The European Commission became involved, contacting the Bulgarian Ministry of Environment and Waters {{for information about the}} dead bats; the Bulgarian Ministry and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences conducted their own probe, stating that the bat kill was within normal parameters. The Veliko Tarnovo Appellate stated that the Lovech Environmental Ministry failed to investigate violations made by The Expendables 2s crew. On February 23, 2012, a Bulgarian court ruled that the crew had violated its filming license.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to verify {{adherence}} to forensic examination principles in homicide cases by analyzing the results of the author’s own study of 90 court and prosecution cases from the period 2000 – 2010. The analyzed cases were sampled using the so-called multi-stage cluster sampling method, commonly used in social sciences in Poland. The cases were held in 17 organizational judiciary and prosecution units reporting to the Court of Appeal in Krakow and <b>Appellate</b> <b>Prosecutor’s</b> Office in Krakow, respectively. The research tool was a questionnaire containing 40 relevant guidelines, covering both qualitative and quantitative features. In the 90 analyzed cases, a total of 251 forensic examination reports were prepared, including 110 site examination reports, 20 separate corpse examination reports, 29 personal examination reports and 92 object examination reports. The research aspects of forensic examinations will be analyzed from the perspective of adherence to the principles of conducting the same. As regards postulates de lege ferenda with respect to the implementation of forensic examination principles one should emphasize the need for using the appropriate form of description of corpse examination; the need for a more responsible attitude towards sealing off crime scenes and for recording information on sealing-off procedures in the examination report; the need for clear distinction of examination stages in drafting the examination report; the need for a detailed analysis of the examination carried out at its final stage at all times; the need for using professional vocabulary in all descriptions of examination activities in each case and the need for regular monitoring (by the person in charge of examination) also with regard to the tactical requirement to sign each sheet of the examination report. The tactical and procedural development of forensic examination principles, taking into account also the postulates de lege ferenda presented herein, will contribute to further development of forensic examination studies and will thus make examination a more common practice in criminal procedures...|$|R
40|$|An {{anthology}} by Austin Sarat is reviewed from {{a critical}} race perspective. The book 2 ̆ 7 s agenda {{is to show}} how the law seeks to work in the world, particularly when, why, and how legal decisions respond to social characteristics of those making them {{as well as those who}} are subject to them. Also emphasized are the complex relations among the law 2 ̆ 7 s various parts (e. g., judges and jurors, police and <b>prosecutors,</b> <b>appellate</b> and trial courts). The book is organized around the law 2 ̆ 7 s paradoxes, purposes of the law which can be somewhat mutually exclusive. Many of the leading voices in the law and society movement are represented in the excerpts included in the anthology. Still, the review shows that the book fails to incorporate a critical race or feminist perspective into its stated goals. Discussion of race is not completely absent, just inadequate. The review considers many of the selections from the anthology and offers some commentary on them, as well as suggesting pieces that may have been included to address race and gender more effectively. The review also briefly considers the relationship between the law and society and critical race movements and pointedly questions what meaning has been imposed upon the law and society movement as a consequence of Sarat constructing and interpreting its introductory canon...|$|R
40|$|Defining Crimes, by the {{distinguished}} author team of William J. Stuntz (late of Harvard) and Joseph L. Hoffmann (Indiana), breaks from {{the tradition of}} Model Penal Code-centric casebooks and focuses instead on the rich intellectual and theoretical issues that arise from how crimes actually get defined and applied today by state and federal legislatures, trial and <b>appellate</b> courts, police, <b>prosecutors,</b> defense lawyers, and juries. The innovative approach of Defining Crimes enables the in-depth study of the problems and issues that affect the day-to-day contemporary practice of criminal law. New Features: New coverage of the controversial issue of police use of deadly force, which—together with the existing section on “stand your ground” laws—facilitates class discussion of the “Black Lives Matter” movement and the shootings of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Eric Garner, among others. New chapter on Gun Crimes, including the Supreme Court’s 2016 decision upholding the criminalization of gun ownership for those convicted of domestic violence crimes. Updated chapter on Federal Criminal Law, including the Court’s 2016 Elonis decision. Updated coverage of criminal cases involving the over-prescription of opoid painkillers {{and other kinds of}} prescription medications. Updated materials on Rape, incorporating coverage of “yes means yes” laws and policies. New and comprehensive student assessment questions, written by the casebook authors, that will be posted to the companion website. [URL]...|$|R
