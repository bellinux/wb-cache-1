40|$|Researches {{carried out}} from 1980 to 1983 in Sardinian oil-producing olive groves {{investigated}} Prays oleae infestations by examining weekly 300 - 600 flower clusters or newly-formed olives. The trend of male catches was examined weekly (in some groves daily) using 3 - 6 pheromone traps in each grove. The daily catches revealed {{the influence of}} climatic factors, trends being similar in the same zone even between groves distant from each other. A strict correspondence was observed between catches, each in sect generation development and plant vegetative stages. <b>Anthophagous</b> generation catches {{proved to be the}} most numerous (June-July), and carpophagous generally the least. Peak oviposition occurred on the drupes when the newly·formed olives began to enlarge, and <b>anthophagous</b> male catches were maximum. Thus, pheromone traps offer an excellent means of establishing the correct time for insecticidal treatment against the eggs and newly-hatched larvae of the carpophagous generation. No correlation was found between <b>anthophagous</b> male catches and oviposition on the olives nor between the number of eggs and larvae boring into the kernel. Up to the moment, therefore, it has not been possible to determine an intervention threshold based on pheromone trap captures...|$|E
40|$|The {{life cycle}} of the transparentwinged plant bug, Hyalopeplus pellucidus (Stal), was studied on guava, Psidium guajava I [...] . Eggs were {{deposited}} in stems, flower buds, and leaf midribs and hatched in an average of 7 days. The 5 nymphal stadia were completed in an average of 14 days. The nymphs were <b>anthophagous,</b> and feeding on flower buds was necessary for normal development. Cage studies showed a direct relationship between feeding injury and the abscission of guava flower buds...|$|E
40|$|The life cycle, host {{plants and}} {{damage caused by}} Luperomorpha xanthodera (Fairmaire), a {{chrysomelid}} recently introduced to Europe, are described. In Tuscany (Italy) L. xanthodera completes 2 generations per year and all stages may overwinter in soil. Adults fly and feed from March-April until autumn. Females oviposit in the soil where larvae complete their development on radicles and pupate. Adults are polyphagous, chiefly <b>anthophagous,</b> causing damage on plants belonging to 23 genera of 19 botanical families. Key words: Alticinae, biology, ornamental nursery, damage...|$|E

Ithome tiaynai es la primera especie descrita desde Chile para este género Descriptions of the adult, larva and pupa of Ithome tiaynai Vargas sp. n. are presented. The <b>anthophagous</b> larvae are {{associated}} with Acacia macracantha Willd (Fabaceae). The distribution of this species includes the coastal valleys of Azapa and Chaca, First Region of Chile.

40|$|A {{combined}} morphological and bionomical {{analysis was}} performed to clarify {{the position of a}} problematic species of the Meligethes lugubris group from Sardinia and Corsica (Coleoptera, Nitidulidae, Meligethinae). This species-group is represented by a dozen <b>anthophagous</b> species associated with Lamiaceae, and distributed from North Africa to Japan. The analysis was mainly focused on the specific distinction and formal description of a new species, M. foddaii Audisio, De Biase & Trizzino sp. nov., from Sardinia and Corsica. The species is morphologically scarcely distinguishable from the allopatric M. lugubris Sturm and M. gagathinus Erichson (both widespread in southern Europe). An identification key to Euro-Mediterranean members of the M. lugubris complex is provided. Combined morphological, ecological, phenological, and preliminary molecular data are presented to support the distinction of the new species. The palaeogeographical scenario explaining the likely Plio-Pleistocene differentiation of the three species, which are all associated with the related Lamiaceae genera Mentha and Thymus, is also briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{operational}} {{availability of}} information about Lobesia botrana (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) (Denis et Schiffermüller) and crop phenology of vine (Vitis vinifera L.) should enhance the effectiveness of IPM activities, especially in the crucial pre-flowering phase, when the oviposition of the <b>anthophagous</b> generation, sometimes responsible of significant damages in Sardinia, takes place. On the ground of this, phenological models referred to vine and moth should be important tools for spatial extension of field observations. This evidence justify the work described in this paper and founded on {{the analysis of the}} relationship between phenological phases of vine and onset of attack of Lobesia botrana. This analysis was carried out by means of (i) a simulation model of the insect biological cycle and (ii) a simulation model of the grapevine phenology referred to the two varieties Cabernet Sauvignon e Chardonnay. Both models were applied to the Alghero (SS- Sardinia) time series 1951 - 2006 of temperature data. Results are discussed and possible future improvements of the method are analyzed...|$|E
40|$|Extant {{terrestrial}} biodiversity arguably {{is driven}} by the evolutionary success of angiosperm plants, but the evolutionary mechanisms and timescales of angiosperm-dependent radiations remain poorly understood. The Scarabaeoidea is a diverse lineage of predominantly plant- and dung-feeding beetles. Here, we present a phylogenetic analysis of Scarabaeoidea based on four DNA markers for a taxonomically comprehensive set of specimens and link it to recently described fossil evidence. The phylogeny strongly supports multiple origins of coprophagy, phytophagy and anthophagy. The ingroup-based fossil calibration of the tree widely confirmed a Jurassic origin of the Scarabaeoidea crown group. The crown groups of phytophagous lineages began to radiate first (Pleurostict scarabs: 108 Ma; Glaphyridae between 101 Ma), followed by the later diversification of coprophagous lineages (crown-group age Scarabaeinae: 76 Ma; Aphodiinae: 50 Ma). Pollen feeding arose even later, at maximally 62 Ma in the oldest <b>anthophagous</b> lineage. The clear time lag between the origins of herbivores and coprophages suggests an evolutionary path driven by the angiosperms that first favoured the herbivore fauna (mammals and insects) followed by the secondary radiation of the dung feeders. This finding makes it less likely that extant dung beetle lineages initially fed on dinosaur excrements, as often hypothesized...|$|E
40|$|Combined {{morphological}} {{and ecological}} data, together with molecular evidence from a companion paper, are presented {{to clarify the}} taxonomic position of four problematic species, members of the Brassicogethes coracinus group, from north-western Spain, eastern Turkey, and Tajikistan (Coleoptera, Nitidulidae, Meligethinae). This species-group was represented by a dozen <b>anthophagous</b> species associated with Brassicaceae, and distributed from North Africa to Middle Asia and southern Siberia. The analysis was mainly focused on the specific distinction and formal description of two new species from E Turkey, B. gloriae sp. nov., and B. coracimimus sp. nov., one species from Tajikistan, B. capannai sp. nov., and one additional new species, B. cantabricus sp. nov., from Cantabrian Mts in NW Spain. B. gloriae sp. nov., strictly associated with Neotchihatchewia isatidea (Boissier) Rauschert (Brassicaceae, Lunarieae), is morphologically related to but molecularly distinct from the rare and sympatric B. longulus (Schilsky, 1894). B. coracimimus sp. nov., whose larval host-plant is unknown, is morphologically and molecularly related to the amply sympatric and common B. coracinus (Sturm, 1845). B. cantabricus sp. nov., strictly associated with Sisymbrium irio L. (Brassicaceae, Sisymbrieae), is morphologically related to but molecularly markedly distinct from the parapatric B. subaeneus (Sturm, 1845). B. capannai sp. nov., whose larval host-plant is unknown, is morphologically related to the rare and allopatric B. longulus (Schilsky, 1894). A short discussion {{of the state of}} art of the taxonomy and phylogeny of members of the B. coracinus group, a key to the identification of the 16 known species, and an updated synoptic table including larval host-plant relationship and geographical distribution of each included species, are finally provided. © Springer-Verlag 2011...|$|E
