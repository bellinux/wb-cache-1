5|$|After Louise's death, {{and after}} bearing {{criticism}} of his war record from other Confederates for decades, Longstreet refuted most of their arguments in his memoirs entitled From Manassas to Appomattox, <b>a</b> <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> five years that was published in 1896. His final years were marked by poor health and partial deafness. In 1902 he suffered from severe rheumatism {{and was unable to}} stand {{for more than a few}} minutes at a time. His weight diminished from 200 to 135 pounds by January 1903. Cancer developed in his right eye, and in December he had X-ray therapy in Chicago to treat it. He contracted pneumonia and died in Gainesville on January 2, 1904, six days before his 83rd birthday. Longstreet's remains are buried in Alta Vista Cemetery. He outlived most of his detractors, and was one of only a few general officers from the Civil War to live into the 20th century.|$|E

[...] On the syndicated television program Siskel & Ebert & the Movies, Ebert and his colleague Gene Siskel gave the film a [...] "two thumbs up" [...] rating. Siskel, in his review for the Chicago Tribune, wrote, [...] "Director Alan Parker has mounted this production well, which is more successful as spectacle than anything else." [...] According to Time magazine's Richard Corliss, [...] "This Evita is not just a long, complex music video; it works and breathes like a real movie, with characters worthy of our affection and deepest suspicions." [...] Critic Zach Conner commented, [...] "It's a relief to say that Evita is pretty damn fine, well-cast, and handsomely visualized. Madonna once again confounds our expectations. She plays Evita with a poignant weariness and has more than just a bit of star quality. Love or hate Madonna-Eva, she is a magnet for all eyes." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{scene in}} the episode, Homer tells Marge about all the jobs he has had, {{referencing}} several episodes of the series. According to Jean, the scene was added during a rewrite of the episode's script. In another scene, Homer, in the Springfield church, attempts to recruit companions for his security company. The scene is {{a reference to the}} 1952 American western film High Noon, although the line [...] "You all know me" [...] was taken from the American horror/thriller film Jaws. When visiting the clothing store Wooly Bully, Homer has a rapid, monotone conversation with the cashier. The two speak in a similar manner to the characters in the American 1950's television crime drama Dragnet, of which Gould was a [...] "big fan". When noticing that one of his ferrets is wearing a wire, Fat Tony tells it [...] "you're not a pet, and you're not a friend. You're nothing to me." [...] The line parodies a similar conversation between Michael and Fredo Corleone in the American gangster film The Godfather Part II. Near the end of the episode, Fat Tony drives to the Simpsons house in {{what seems to be a}} white Dodge Caravan, while shots of Springfield are shown on the way. The scene parodies the title sequence of the American television drama series The Sopranos, and features Alabama 3's song [...] "Woke Up This Morning," [...] which is also used in The Sopranos title sequence.

500|$|Written in 1969 {{and later}} {{published}} in the Houseworker's Handbook, Betsy Warrior's Housework: Slavery or <b>a</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>of</b> Love and The Source of Leisure Time presents a cogent argument that the production and reproduction of domestic labor performed by women constitutes the foundation of all economic transactions and survival; although, unremunerated and {{not included in the}} GDP. According to Warrior: [...] "Economics, as it's presented today, lacks any basis in reality as it leaves out the very foundation of economic life. That foundation is built on women's labor; first her reproductive labor which produces every new laborer (and the first commodity, which is mother's milk and which sustains every new consumer/laborer); secondly, women's labor entails environmentally necessary cleaning, cooking to make raw materials consumable, negotiating to maintain social stability and nurturing, which prepares for market and maintains each laborer. This constitutes women's continuing industry enabling laborers to occupy every position in the work force. Without this fundamental labor and commodity there would be no economic activity nor we would have survived to continue to evolve." [...] Warrior also notes that the unacknowledged income of men from illegal activities like arms, drugs and human trafficking, political graft, religious emoluments and various other undisclosed activities provide a rich revenue stream to men, which further invalidates GDP figures. [...] Even in underground economies where women predominate numerically, like trafficking in humans, prostitution and domestic servitude, {{only a tiny fraction of}} the pimp's revenue filters down to the women and children he deploys. Usually the amount spent on them is merely for the maintenance of their lives and, in the case of those prostituted, some money may be spent on clothing and such accouterments as will make them more salable to the pimp's clients. For instance, focusing on just the U.S.A., according to a government sponsored report by the Urban Institute in 2014, [...] "A street prostitute in Dallas may make as little as $5 per sex act. But pimps can take in $33,000 a week in Atlanta, where the sex business brings in an estimated $290 million per year." [...] Warrior believes that only an inclusive, facts-based economic analysis will provide a reliable bases for future planning for environmental and reproductive/population needs.|$|E

2500|$|Fiore {{was likely}} {{involved}} {{in at least}} one other duel that year, between his final named student Azzone di Castelbarco and Giovanni degli Ordelaffi, as the latter is known to have died in 1399. After Castelbarco's duels, Fiore's activities are unclear. Based on the allegiances of the nobles that he trained in the 1390s, he seems to have been associated with the ducal court of Milan {{in the latter part of}} his career. Some time in the first years of the 15th century, Fiore composed a fencing treatise in Italian and Latin called [...] "The Flower of Battle" [...] (rendered variously as Fior di Battaglia, Florius de Arte Luctandi, and Flos Duellatorum). The briefest version of the text is dated to 1409 and indicates that it was <b>a</b> <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> six months and great personal effort; as evidence suggests that two longer versions were composed some time before this, we may assume that he devoted a considerable amount of time to writing during this decade.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{wrote that}} Halloween II {{represented}} [...] "a fall from greatness" [...] that [...] "doesn't even {{attempt to do}} justice to the original." [...] He also commented, [...] "Instead, it tries to outdo all the other violent Halloween rip-offs of the last several years." [...] Web based critic James Berardinelli offered a particularly stinging review:The main problem is the film's underlying motivation. Halloween was <b>a</b> <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> love, made by people committed to creating the most suspenseful and compelling motion picture they could. Halloween II was impelled by the desire to make money. It was a postscript—and not a very good one—slapped together because a box office success was guaranteed. He accused Carpenter and Hill of not believing [...] "in this project the way they believed in the original, and it shows in the final product. The creepiness of the first movie {{has been replaced by a}} growing sense of repetitive boredom." [...] Berardinelli was not impressed by the decision to give Myers so much screen time. He says, [...] "The Shape, who was an ominous and forbidding force, has been turned into a plodding zombie. The characters have all been lobotomized, and, in keeping with the slasher trend, the gore content is way up. There was virtually no blood in Halloween; Halloween II cheerfully heaps it on." ...|$|E

Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, noting [...] "Baz Luhrmann dreamed of making the Australian Gone with the Wind, and so he has, with much of that film's lush epic beauty and some of the same awkwardness with a national legacy of racism". David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek, wrote, [...] "Kidman seems to blossom under Luhrmann's direction: she's funny, warm and charming, and the erotic charge between her and the gruff, hunky Jackman is delicious. In a solemn season, Australias bold, kitschy, unapologetic artifice is a welcome respite". In her review for the New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote, [...] "this creation story about modern Australia is a testament to movie love at its most devout, cinematic spectacle at its most extreme, and kitsch as an act of aesthetic communion". Andrew Sarris, in his review for the New York Observer, wrote, [...] "Australia is clearly <b>a</b> <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> love, and a matter of national pride. It is also a bit of a mess. I must confess that I might have been harder on Mr Luhrmann's film if I had not remained entranced by Ms Kidman ever since I first saw her in Phillip Noyce's Dead Calm in 1989; in my opinion, she has lost none of her luster in the 20 years since". In his review for Time, Richard Schickel wrote, [...] "Have you seen everything Australia has on offer a dozen times before? Sure you have. It's a movie less created by director and co-writer Baz Luhrmann than assembled, Dr Frankenstein-style, from the leftover body parts of earlier movies. Which leaves us asking this question: How come it is so damnably entertaining?" [...] Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal, opines that, [...] "in its heart of hearts Australia is an old-fashioned Western - a Northern, if you will - and all the more enjoyable for it." [...] Nick Rogers, of FilmYap, adds that, [...] "Luhrmann mythologized his homeland as American directors like John Ford did with Westerns — dramatic-license exaggerations that pay off in droves." [...] Ann Hornaday, in her review for the Washington Post, wrote, [...] "A wildly ambitious, luridly indulgent spectacle of romance, action, melodrama and revisionism, Australia is windy, overblown, utterly preposterous and insanely entertaining". In her review for Salon.com, Stephanie Zacharek wrote, [...] "The second half of Australia, Luhrmann's attempt to pull off a wartime weeper, is so aggressively sentimental that it begins to feel more like punishment than pleasure. I left Australia feeling drained and weakened, as if I'd suffered a gradual poisoning at the hands of a mad scientist".|$|E
