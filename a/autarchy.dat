Como consequência, surgiu o SCI, presente em todos os organismos da Administração Pública, com o objectivo de se tornar num instrumento privilegiado de apoio à gestão dos mesmos, permitindo um aumento da eficácia e eficiência das operações, uma maior fiabilidade da informação financeira, bem como o cumprimento com os diplomas legais aplicáveis. Começou-se com uma revisão da literatura sobre a evolução da auditoria, contextualizando o controlo interno como um dos pontos de análise da auditoria interna. Posteriormente, apresentou-se o Sector Público até alcançar as Juntas de Freguesia, convergindo os conceitos abordados na óptica destas autarquias. O caso empírico consistiu num questionário dirigido aos Presidentes das Juntas de Freguesia da nossa população (27 autarquias, 17 das quais do Concelho da Maia e 10 do Concelho de Matosinhos), com uma taxa de resposta de 85, 2 %. Face às hipóteses formuladas, pode-se concluir que a existência do SCI e a dimensão da autarquia estão relacionadas. Em sentido oposto, nenhuma das outras hipóteses se confirmou, ou seja, não existe relação entre a importância atribuída ao SCI e o nível académico do Presidente da Junta de Freguesia, entre o bom funcionamento do SCI e a importância atribuída ao SCI, nem entre a existência do Órgão/Serviço de Auditoria Interna e a dimensão da autarquia. Os resultados obtidos permitem concluir que a maioria das autarquias tem um Regulamento de Controlo Interno implementado, ao qual atribui uma grande importância, e cujo funcionamento acreditam ser adequado. O estudo mostra, também, que no entendimento dos Presidentes das Juntas de Freguesia, {{a principal}} vantagem de um SCI bem implementado resulta da conformidade com leis e regulamentos, e a principal dificuldade para o seu bom funcionamento prende-se com o reduzido número de meios humanos. Contudo, a presença de Auditoria Interna nestas autarquias é, ainda, muito reduzida, apesar destes autarcas apontarem como principal vantagem da existência deste serviço, o apoio às mesmas para a optimização dos seus recursos. Estas conclusões evidenciam a necessidade de uma maior atenção sobre o SCI, e duma aposta concreta na implementação da auditoria interna nestas autarquias, como forma de apoio à sua gestão. The State Financial Administration Reform revealed {{a growing concern}} about control and surveillance, initially on budgetary aspects, and presently in a global dimension. As a result, the ICS (Internal Control System) appeared, present in every Public Administration organisms, {{in order to become}} a privileged instrument to support their management, allowing an increase in the effectiveness and efficiency of operations, a higher financial information reliability, as well as the compliance with the applicable legal acts. It initiated by a literature review on the auditing progress, contextualizing the internal control as an internal auditing analysis point.

Regarding the formulated hypotheses we are allowed to conclude that ICS existence and the autarky dimension are related. On the other hand, all the other hypotheses weren’t confirmed, in other words, it wasn’t confirmed a relationship existence between the ICS importance given and the Parish Council President academic level, between the ICS smooth functioning and the ICS implementation, and also, between the Internal Auditing Board/Service existence and the autarky dimension. The results allowed concluding that most of the <b>autarchies</b> have an Internal Control Regulation implemented, which attaches considerable importance, and believe they have it functioning properly. This study also shows that, according to the understanding of Parish Councils Presidents, the main advantage of a well implemented ICS is its compliance with laws and regulations, and the main difficulty for their proper functioning is related to the reduced number of human resources. However, the Internal Auditing presence in these <b>autarchies</b> despite being greatly reduced, still the majors aspects pointed out as main advantages of this service existence, support the decision to optimize its resources. These conclusions show the need to a higher ICS attention, and a concrete investment and strong belief towards an Internal Auditing implementation in these <b>autarchies,</b> as a way to support the autarchic management.

40|$|With {{a special}} {{interest}} {{in the nature of the}} interwar Portuguese dictatorial regime, this paper will analyse the path followed by contemporary European aesthetic paradigms among the Portuguese architects. The aim is to understand whether these ideas paradigms were internally absorbed and externally implicated in the built environment. To achieve this aim, architects’ travels will be reconstructed, minding that travel will be conceptualized in a broad sense, encompassing different contacts with non-Portuguese reality, such as through personal libraries, attendance to congresses, visits to exhibitions, study tours, vacations, education abroad, and acquaintance with foreign architects. This knowledge is expected to enlighten whether certain right-wing dictatorial political models, like Nazism and Fascism, were apprehended and embodied by architects involved in public buildings' commissions; or, conversely, if the aesthetic influence of Portuguese long-standing allies, like the United Kingdom and France, was still dominant. Stretching the argument, one might event wonder if the <b>autarchy's</b> political claims during the Portuguese regime were also extended to the architectural field. All in all, the research's initial hypothesis was that some architects were more cosmopolitan than acknowledged. In proving it, the emphasis put by the art history and architectural history on Portuguese atavism loses strength, as architects would have been inspired and influenced by as many as the existent European regimes...|$|R

5000|$|Robert LeFevre, a [...] "self-proclaimed autarchist" [...] {{recognized}} as such by Murray Rothbard, distinguished autarchism from anarchy, whose economics he felt entailed interventions contrary to freedom, {{in contrast to}} his own laissez-faire economics of the Austrian School. In professing [...] "a sparkling and shining individualism" [...] while [...] "it advocates some kind of procedure {{to interfere with the}} processes of a free market", anarchy seemed to LeFevre to be self-contradictory. He situated the fundamental premise of <b>autarchy</b> within the Stoicism of philosophers such as Zeno, Epicurus and Marcus Aurelius, which he summarized in the credo, [...] "Control yourself". Fusing these influences together, he arrived at the autarchist philosophy: [...] "The Stoics provide the moral framework; the Epicureans, the motivation; the praxeologists, the methodology. I propose to call this package of ideological systems <b>autarchy,</b> because <b>autarchy</b> means self-rule." [...] LeFevre stated that [...] "the bridge between Spooner and modern-day autarchists was constructed primarily by persons such as H. L. Mencken, Albert Jay Nock, and Mark Twain".|$|E
40|$|The rural {{wireless}} {{networks are}} increasingly in demand by associations and <b>autarchies</b> to expand Internet access {{in this type}} of areas. The problem of such solutions centers not only in network deployment and its maintenance, but also in the equipment installation on clients, which always has big costs. This installation and configuration must be performed by a technician on site, so that the equipment can be integrated in the infrastructure. To try to mitigate this problem, it is presented a solution that allows the clients to install, with transparency, the device at home, reducing not only the cost for the management entity but also for the clients. This way, for info-excluded people or with new technology low experience level, it is the user that integrates himself in the network, making him part of the process, fostering the network usage. In this article are specified not only the system architecture but also the way that it works and how it obtains the desirable result. The tests made to the solution show the quickness, reliability and autonomy in the execution of the tasks, making it a benefit for rural wireless networks. This solution, by its robustness and simplicity, allowed an uptake to the IT by people who never thought to do it, namely an advanced age group (elderly) who want to join the world of the new technologies</p...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{contradictory}} processes {{that arise from}} projects of democratic decentralisation in the contexts of those post-civil war, emergent pluralistic democracies and ruling elites that typically strive to officially maintain essentialist forms of national unity, identity and commemorations. These contradictions significantly shape projects of democratisation and decentralisation in post-conflict countries, {{even though they have}} not been thoroughly accounted for in the expert literature. In Mozambique, these contradictions were analysed through the unrelenting attempts by the main Mozambican opposition party, Renamo, to inscribe officially in the country 2 ̆ 7 s landscape their own version of the post-independence civil war (1976 – 1992). Taking advantage of the Law 2 / 97, known as the Juridical Framework for the Implantation of Local <b>Autarchies,</b> Renamo built a square with a sculpture to honour André Matsangaíssa, Renamo 2 ̆ 7 s first commander killed in combat during the war. The inauguration of Matsangaíssa Square was the focal point of serious elite factional contestation and debates in the media and in the streets about the appropriate memories to give a new sense to national unity, identity and decentralisation. The Frelimo government both appealed to the Administrative Court and recentralised some aspects of the decentralisation law. Although the elites 2 ̆ 7 representations of the meaning of decentralisation and recentralisation shape the public 2 ̆ 7 s views, the positions of the ordinary people signal that the dynamics of decentralisation and national identity are far more complex than the elite partisan discourses which are also at times incoherent. The overall analyses demonstrate how conflicts over memories of violence paradoxically hamper and constitute political pluralism, democratisation and decentralisation in post-civil war Mozambique...|$|R
