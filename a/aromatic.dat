40|$|The {{formation}} of <b>aromatics</b> during the reaction between methane and oxygen between 970 and 1220 K, at elevated pressure has been studied. High selectivities and yields of the <b>aromatics,</b> i. e. benzene and toluene, are obtained over certain oxide catalysts, although, <b>aromatics</b> are also formed when no catalyst is present. A manganese oxide catalyst doped with sodium chloride gave the highest yield of <b>aromatics,</b> however, supported nickel or platinum catalysts, {{which have been}} reported to be active catalysts for <b>aromatics</b> formation, were found to give lower yields of <b>aromatics</b> than for the gas-phase reaction.

50|$|The {{two most}} common {{petrochemical}} classes are olefins (including ethylene and propylene) and <b>aromatics</b> (including benzene, toluene and xylene isomers). Oil refineries produce olefins and <b>aromatics</b> by {{fluid catalytic cracking}} of petroleum fractions. Chemical plants produce olefins by steam cracking of natural gas liquids like ethane and propane. <b>Aromatics</b> are produced by catalytic reforming of naphtha. Olefins and <b>aromatics</b> are the building-blocks {{for a wide range}} of materials such as solvents, detergents, and adhesives. Olefins are the basis for polymers and oligomers used in plastics, resins, fibers, elastomers, lubricants, and gels.|$|R

5|$|A {{peroxidase}} enzyme {{known as}} MroAPO (Marasmius rotula <b>aromatic</b> peroxygenase) is attracting research interest for possible applications in biocatalysis. In general, enzymes that catalyze oxygen-transfer reactions are of great utility in chemical synthesis since they work selectively and under ambient conditions. Fungal peroxidases can catalyze oxidations {{that are difficult}} for the organic chemist, including those involving <b>aromatic</b> substrates such as aniline, 4-aminophenol, hydroquinone, resorcinol, catechol, and paracetamol. The M.rotula enzyme is the first fungal peroxygenase that can be produced in high yields. It is highly stable over a wide pH range, and {{in a variety of}} organic solvents. The enzyme has other potential for use as a biosensor for <b>aromatic</b> substances in environmental analysis and drug monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Alcohols do not {{normally}} behave as acids in water, but {{the presence of}} a double bond adjacent to the OH group can substantially decrease the pKa by the mechanism of keto–enol tautomerism. Ascorbic acid is an example of this effect. The diketone 2,4-pentanedione (acetylacetone) is also a weak acid because of the keto–enol equilibrium. In <b>aromatic</b> compounds, such as phenol, which have an OH substituent, conjugation with the <b>aromatic</b> ring as a whole greatly increases the stability of the deprotonated form.|$|E
50|$|Another {{process for}} {{producing}} BTX <b>aromatics</b> involves the steam cracking of hydrocarbons which typically produces a cracked naphtha product {{commonly referred to}} as pyrolysis gasoline, pyrolysis gas or pygas. The pyrolysis gasoline typically consists of C6 to C8 <b>aromatics,</b> heavier <b>aromatics</b> containing 9 to 11 or 12 carbon atoms, and non-aromatic cyclic hydrocarbons (naphthenes) containing 6 or more carbon atoms.|$|R

40|$|Earlier results [1, 2] for mono- and {{bimetallic}} reforming catalysts {{have indicated}} that naphtha feedstocks with boiling points up to 180 - 190 QC and having average carbon numbers higher than nine yielded {{a high percentage of}} C 9 <b>aromatics.</b> When reforming naphthas containing fractions boiling above 165 QC, CIO <b>aromatics</b> are also obtained besides C 9 <b>aromatics</b> [3, 4].

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper was to measure the {{apparent}} coefficients of diffusion, Knudsen diffusivities, pore diffusivities and activation energies of diffusion at 26 - 32 oC and to determine the modes of transport of some alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol, n-butanol) and <b>aromatics</b> (benzene, ethylbenzene, propylbenzene, toluene, o-xylene, mxylene, p-xylene) into the porous structure of MCM- 41 mesoporous material synthesized. The diffusion coefficients of alcohols and <b>aromatics</b> were calculated from the slope of graphs of Mt/M∞ versus t 1 / 2. As the molecular weight of the alcohols and <b>aromatics</b> increased, apparent coefficients of diffusion decreased, the activation energy for diffusion increased. Lower molecular weight alcohols and <b>aromatics</b> had higher coefficients of diffusion compared to those with higher molecular weight alcohols at the same temperatures. The diffusion of isomeric molecules within the mesoporous channels were affected by the position of branching, the deterministic behavior depended on the molecular weight, length of side chain and ortho, meta and para isomerism of the molecule. Increasing the temperature, raised the kinetic energy of the molecules which resulted increases in the coefficients of diffusion of the alcohols and <b>aromatics</b> in the MCM- 41 material. Diffusion rate constants of alcohols and <b>aromatics</b> increased with {{temperature within the range}} of 26 - 32 °C, and decreased as the molecular weight of the diffusing chemical increased. The diffusion of alcohols and <b>aromatics</b> in the MCM- 41 obeyed the anomalous transport mechanism. Diffusion exponents, n, being in the range of 0. 99 - 1. 07 indicated an anomalous diffusion non-Fickian/super-Case II) mechanism for alcohol diffusion. However for the case of <b>aromatics,</b> diffusion exponents from 0. 7 to 1. 00 indicated that the diffusion mechanisms were either non-Fickian or non-Fickian/super-Case II depending on the substitution to the benzene ring. Activation energies of alcohols and <b>aromatics</b> were also in good agreement with the values of coefficients of diffusion of alcohols and <b>aromatics</b> such that larger activation energies resulted in smaller diffusion coefficients...|$|R

40|$|Quasi-continuous {{measurement}} of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and isomers of xylene in northern England has been performed using an automated thermal desorption - gas chromatography - flame ionisation detector (TD-GC-FID) system. The TD-GC-FID system was mounted in a mobile laboratory, {{together with a}} TEOM (Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance) system for particulate monitoring, and a weather station. Both systems have been applied to urban and suburban sites {{in order to examine}} the behaviour of BTEX <b>aromatics</b> at these localities, under a range of boundary layer environments. Measurement of BTEX <b>aromatics</b> and particulate matter has also been performed within a bus depot, a site which was effectively isolated from the free boundary layer overnight, to contrast the behaviour of BTEX in sunlit and non-sunlit atmospheres. Time series analysis of the concentration ratios of individual BTEX <b>aromatics</b> has been performed and diurnal seasonality has been demonstrated at a number of sites. Significant differential removal of individual BTEX <b>aromatics</b> has been found to occur overnight. Relative removal rates have been measured for this period, and values indicate that accepted tropospheric transformation mechanisms of the BTEX <b>aromatics</b> are not responsible. The available experimental and theoretical evidence collected in this research serves to support the supposition that a physical process, which is related to atmospheric temperature, volatility of individual BTEX <b>aromatics,</b> and pressures of individual BTEX <b>aromatics,</b> governs nocturnal differentiation of the concentration of BTEX <b>aromatics.</b> A postulated effect, which may contribute to nocturnal differential, is preferential absorption of particular BTEX <b>aromatics</b> to a liquid organic carbon phase, which {{has been shown to be}} associated with diesel carbonaceous combustion aerosol.
