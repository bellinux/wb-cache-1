Fire behavior simulations showed that shrublands had the greatest flame lengths under low wind conditions, and that pinyon-juniper woodlands had the greatest flame lengths when winds exceeded 25 km hr− 1 and fire transitioned to the crowns. <b>Air</b> pollution <b>removal</b> capacity (PM 10, O 3, NO 2, etc.) was significantly greater in pinyon-juniper stands, followed by shrublands and grasslands. Carbon storage (trees and burned tree snags only) did not significantly differ between pinyon-juniper and burned stands (| 14 000 kg ha− 1), but will change as burned snags decompose. Annual C sequestration rates in pinyon-juniper stands averaged 630 kg ha− 1 yr− 1. A landscape-level assessment showed that total compliance with residential defensible space regulations would result in minimal impact to <b>air</b> pollution <b>removal</b> capacity and carbon sequestration due to a currently low population density.

40|$|Introduction of gaseous microemboli (GME) {{into the}} {{arterial}} {{line of a}} pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit may lead to cognitive decline and adverse outcomes of the pediatric patient. Arterial filters are incorporated into CPB circuits as a safeguard for gross air and to reduce GME. Recently, arterial filters were integrated in two neonatal oxygenators to reduce volume and foreign surface area. In this study a clinical CPB scenario was simulated. The oxygenators, the corresponding venous reservoirs and the complete CPB circuits were compared regarding <b>air</b> <b>removal</b> and bubble size distribution after the introduction of an air bolus or GME. During a GME challenge, the Capiox FX 05 oxygenator removed a significantly higher volume of GME than the QUADROX-i Neonatal oxygenator (97 % vs. 86 %). Detailed <b>air</b> <b>removal</b> characteristics showed that more GME {{in the range of}} 20 - 50 mu m were leaving the devices than were entering. This phenomenon seems to be more present in the Capiox FX 05. The circuits were also challenged with an air bolus. Each individual component tested removed 99. 9 %, which resulted in an air volume reduction of 99. 99 % by either complete CBP circuit. Overall, we conclude that both CPB systems were very adequate in removing GME and gross air. The <b>air</b> <b>removal</b> properties of both systems are considered safe and reliable.

40|$|Steam {{sterilization}} Hollow Load Process Challenge Devices (HLPCDs) {{are designed}} to assess the adequacy of <b>air</b> <b>removal</b> and steam penetration in a porous load steam sterilization process including those used in {{both large and small}} sterilizers. A PCD should be used in every load to ensure adequacy of <b>air</b> <b>removal</b> and steam penetration. Use of PCDs is also {{an integral part of the}} quality assurance systems used to ensure the sterility of each batch of reusable medical devices. There are a number of HLPCDs commercially available which have various design features ranging from simple tubular helical designs compliant to EN 867 - 5 to more complex electronic measurement systems. The aim of this study was to assess seven commercially produced HLPCDs for their ability to detect residual air in a porous load steam sterilizer employing a range of <b>air</b> <b>removal</b> stages. In addition to testing in processes deemed to be satisfactory, assessment was also carried out in cycles in which increasing amounts of residual air was artificially induced. The performance of each HLPCD was compared to that of a Bowie and Dick (BD) textile test pack into which were inserted temperature sensors. All tests were carried out with a single device in an empty chamber. The BD textile pack was chosen as a reference because it is well established as reference device for both full load and empty chamber tests. Only one of the seven HLPCDs tested exhibited equivalent performance to the BD reference device. One HLPCD was overly sensitive, failing an acceptable process. Four HLPCDs were incapable of detecting large failures in sub/super atmospheric pulsing cycles. One HLPCD was insensitive to residual air introduced into the chamber as a bolus at a specific point in the cycle. The results of this study show an unacceptable variability in performance in HLPCDs claimed to meet EN 867 - 5. Users should be extremely cautious when selecting an appropriate PCD for use in their own Sterile Service Departments and where possible, evaluation should be carried out before selections are made. Some HLPCDs will lead to a false sense of security and may result in processed goods being released into use, the sterility of which may be compromised due to undetected process failures...|$|E

However, there is little information about the role of these tree dominated, public streetscapes on the local-scale provision of ecosystem services in European mid-sized cities. In the present study, we explored the local-scale effects of different tree dominated streetscape types on mitigating temperatures and air pollution in the city of Bolzano, Italy by integrating the ENVI-met and UFORE models as well as local field, pollution and climate data. We found that total estimated <b>air</b> pollution <b>removal</b> by trees in Bolzano was 2. 42 metric tons per year (t/yr); with ozone (1. 2 t/yr) being the pollutant most removed and carbon monoxide (0. 03 t/yr) the least. Total <b>air</b> pollution <b>removal</b> (901. 4 kg/yr) was greatest in parks. Total biogenic volatile organic compound emissions, an ecosystem disservice, were also estimated. The ENVI-met simulations found that urban trees can reduce streetscape temperatures by up to 2 °C during the summer and improve human thermal comfort. Results can be used to better understand the dynamics of local-scale ecosystem services of mid-size European cities and to better assess the role of urban streetscapes and {{green infrastructure}} in improving human well-being and mitigating the effects of climate change...|$|R
