40|$|This work {{represents}} {{an analysis of}} the spatial and temporal variability of nitrate deposition and preservation recorded in multiple ice core and snow pit records from the Greenland ice sheet. The primary objective of this research was to develop improved estimates of variability in the preserved ice core record of nitrate to aid in the interpretation of paleoatmospheric concentrations of reactive nitrogen compounds. Three separate works are presented, each focusing on a unique component of variability. The first is a study related to the direct preservation of nitrate over a single year. The second and third topics are related to analysis of ice core records collected during NASA's Program for Arctic Regional Climate Assessment (PARCA) which was initiated in 1993 and continued through 2002. The first study of preservation demonstrated that nitrate, despite possible post-depositional cycling and alteration, was well preserved throughout the year, such that the total flux measured in a snow pit taken to represent the previous year, was representative of snow surface concentrations during the past year. The small difference in preserved concentrations from observed surface snow concentrations gives evidence of only 7 % post-depositional loss at this site (mean annual accumulation ~ 23 g cm- 2 yr- 1). Results from these studies indicate that at this site accumulation is the most significant process affecting preservation of nitrate in the firn. In the second study, the temporal variability of preserved nitrate was evaluated through time series analysis and correlation studies with available paleoclimate proxy records. Six Greenland ice cores covering the period 1794 - 1995 show correlated co-variability of nitrate concentration for periods greater than ten years and a ~ 60 % increase in average concentration during the last 75 years. The changes in concentration yield ~ 30 % higher nitrate flux (2. 5 to 3. 2 &# 61549;g m- 2 a- 1) and ~ 11 % greater variability during 1895 - 1994 period versus the prior 100 years. Nitrate trends in the cores during the last 100 years are also correlated with global nitrate emissions, with an average r-value of 0. 93 for the six cores. The last study focused on spatial variability of nitrate, and the relation of deposition to components of the earth system including temperature and accumulation. The objective {{of the study was to}} assess the contribution of spatial (latitude, longitude, and elevation) and climate (accumulation and temperature) components to the preserved record. Furthermore, the study evaluated the influence of anthropogenic activities on the spatial distribution of nitrate of the Greenland ice sheet. Large scale spatial variability exists as a result of accumulation gradients, with concentration 5 % greater in the northern plateau, yet flux over the northern plateau is 30 % lower than the dry snow zone as a whole. While spatially, flux appears to be more dependent on accumulation, preservation of flux shows increasing dependence on concentration with increasing accumulation. The relationship between concentration and accumulation is non-linear, showing less dependence in the low <b>accumulation</b> <b>regions</b> versus high <b>accumulation</b> <b>regions.</b> <b>Accumulation</b> alone is insufficient to account for the observed variability in nitrate flux in the low <b>accumulation</b> <b>regions,</b> and evidence supports an additional component to a transfer function model for nitrate that includes photochemistry, temperature, and possibly sublimation. In high <b>accumulation</b> <b>regions,</b> evidence points to a dilution effect, with concentration decreases resulting from increased accumulation. Flux estimates over the ice sheet are compared with a GEOS-CHEM model estimate of reactive nitrogen vertical fluxes showing the model captures a significant component of the variability in the southern portion of the ice sheet, but under-represents the flux and variability in the northern half of the ice sheet by a factor of 4...|$|R

It is known that the barrier height and the width of the <b>accumulation</b> <b>region</b> are related to the net positive surface charge (see below), which might be caused by donor-like surface states or adsorbed atoms [33]. Under UV illumination, electron-hole pairs will be generated, and the quasi-Fermi level of electrons and holes will shift toward conduction band and valence band, respectively. The position of the quasi-Fermi level depends on the density of the photo-generated carriers. Due to the small volume of the nanoparticles, it is possible that even at relatively low excitation the quasi-Fermi level of electrons can cross the (2 +/ 0) level.

The participants included 19 elderly CN, 19 aMCI, and 19 AD subjects. The voxel-based quantitative susceptibility map (QSM) and GMV in the brain were calculated and the differences of those insides were compared among the three groups. The differences of the QSM data and GMVs among the three groups were investigated by voxel-based and region of interest (ROI) -based comparisons using a one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) test with the gender and age as covariates. Finally, a receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed. The voxel-based results showed that QSM demonstrated more areas with significant difference between the CN and AD groups compared to GMV.

Capacitance voltage measurements showed per-turbations in the carrier profile corresponding to depletion and <b>accumulation</b> <b>regions</b> at the interface which are directly related to interface states at and around the regrowth interface. The measured concentration of the interface states are in the range 1. 2 x 101 ~ to 7. 05 x 1011 cm- 2. The former is one of the lowest reported till date. The concen-tration of deep traps in the regrown layer and interface, observed by deep level transient spectroscopy, is much lower than the interface state density. Their contribution to car-rier perturbation is insignificant, except in one case where an electron trap has a rather high concentration. Results of secondary ion mass spectroscopy indicate that the pres-ence of carbon at the regrown interface is not principally responsible for creating the high resistivity interface region. Our data favor the concept of a disordered region cre-ated at the interface during regrowth.
