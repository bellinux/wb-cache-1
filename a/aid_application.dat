25|$|The first {{electrical}} {{hearing aid}} used the carbon microphone {{of the telephone}} and was introduced in 1896. The vacuum tube made electronic amplification possible, but early versions of amplified hearing aids were too heavy to carry around. Miniaturization of vacuum tubes lead to portable models, and after World War II, wearable models using miniature tubes. The transistor invented in 1948 was well suited to the hearing <b>aid</b> <b>application</b> due to low power and small size; hearing aids were an early adopter of transistors. The development of integrated circuits allowed further improvement of the capabilities of wearable aids, including implementation of digital signal processing techniques and programmability for the individual user's needs.|$|E
25|$|Legal aid is {{available}} for committal proceedings in the Magistrates’ Courts; cases tried in the District Court and the Court of First Instance of the High Court; and appeals from the Magistrates’ Courts, and to the Court of Appeal of the High Court or the Court of Final Appeal. An applicant must satisfy the means test criteria which {{are the same as}} for civil cases. Notwithstanding that an applicant’s financial resources exceed the statutory limit, the Director of Legal Aid may grant legal aid to the applicant if the Director is satisfied that it is desirable in the interests of justice to do so. However, in appeal cases, the Director of Legal Aid must be satisfied that there are meritorious grounds for appeal with a reasonable prospect of success. Notwithstanding the refusal of a legal <b>aid</b> <b>application</b> by the Director of Legal Aid, a judge may himself grant aid if the applicant has satisfied the means test. Applicants in cases involving a charge of murder, treason or piracy with violence may apply to a judge for granting of legal aid, and exemption from the means test and from payment of contribution.|$|E

The motivation behind this assumption is that in most real-life situations, for instance, a conversation, the user is facing the desired sound source. In a free field, the two-microphone GSC can cancel out an interfering sound source without distorting the desired signal, which is a desirable feature in hearing aids. Thus, the GSC is well suited for hearing <b>aid</b> <b>applications,</b> and we study the impact of quantization errors on the GSC in this paper.|$|R

Students may, however, submit a CSS PROFILE to Princeton and later automatically transmit that information onto Princeton's form.|$|E
50|$|The {{application}} for the CSS PROFILE is usually available on October 1 in the calendar year preceding {{the year that}} a student hopes to receive financial aid.

Then after student completes the FAFSA (the official financial <b>aid</b> <b>application)</b> colleges may then make adjustments to their financial aid awards if necessary.|$|E
