5|$|A {{physical}} USB device may {{consist of}} several logical sub-devices that {{are referred to}} as device functions. A single device may provide several functions, for example, a webcam (video device function) with <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> microphone (audio device function). This kind of device is called a composite device. An alternative to this is compound device, in which the host assigns each logical device a distinctive address and all logical devices connect to <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> hub that connects to the physical USB cable.|$|E
5|$|Console organs {{have two}} 61-note manuals and a pedalboard {{of at least}} two octaves. Most {{consoles}} do not have <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> power amplifier or speakers, so an external amplifier and speaker cabinet is required.|$|E

5|$|In September 2014, Steam Music, <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> music player, {{was added}} to the Steam client, {{allowing}} users to play through music stored on their computer or to stream from a locally networked computer.|$|E
5|$|Oracle's dialect of SQL {{provides}} <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> function DECODE {{which can}} be used instead of the simple CASE expressions and considers two nulls equal.|$|E
5|$|The Number One periscope was Tritons navigational periscope, {{and it had}} <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> sextant {{developed}} by the Kollmorgen Optical Company that allowed navigators to observe celestial bodies {{in order to obtain}} an accurate star fix to plot the ship's course and position.|$|E
50|$|The Micro Scout {{was added}} as an entry level to Lego robotics.It {{is a very}} limited Pbrick with <b>a</b> single <b>{{built-in}}</b> light sensor and <b>a</b> single <b>built-in</b> motor.It has seven built-in programs and can be controlled by a Scout, Spybotics or RCX unit using VLL. Like the Scout, the Micro Scout is also based on a microcontroller from Toshiba.|$|R

5|$|The T series, {{produced}} from 1968 to 1975, {{was the last}} of the tonewheel spinet organs. Unlike all the earlier Hammond organs, which used vacuum tubes for preamplification, amplification, percussion and chorus-vibrato control, the T series used all-solid-state, transistor circuitry, though, unlike the L-100, it did include the scanner-vibrato as seen on the B-3. Other than the T-100 series models, all other T-Series models included <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> rotating Leslie speaker and some included an analog drum machine, while the T-500 also included <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> cassette recorder. It {{was one of the last}} tonewheel Hammonds produced.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} on this theme were oil-lamp clocks. These early timekeeping devices {{consisted of a}} graduated glass reservoir to hold oil — usually whale oil, which burned cleanly and evenly — supplying the fuel for <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> lamp. As the level in the reservoir dropped, it provided a rough measure of the passage of time.|$|E
5|$|Although the Dreamcast {{had a short}} {{lifespan}} {{and limited}} third-party support, reviewers have considered the console ahead of its time. Its library contains many games considered creative and innovative, including Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio and Shenmue, as well as high-quality ports from Sega's NAOMI arcade system board. The Dreamcast {{was also the first}} console to include <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> modem for Internet support and online play.|$|E

5|$|Loitering munitions fit in {{the niche}} between cruise {{missiles}} and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) sharing characteristics with both. They differ from cruise missiles {{in that they are}} designed to loiter for a relatively long time around the target area, and from UCAVs in that a loitering munition is intended to be expended in an attack and has <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> warhead.|$|E
5|$|Perfect Dark {{includes}} <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> rumble functionality {{into the}} game cartridge and supports the Game Boy Printer, Game Link Cable, and Transfer Pak accessories. The Transfer Pak allows certain features within the Nintendo 64 game to alternatively be unlocked. Perfect Dark received generally a mixed reaction from video game critics, who criticized its superficial stealth mechanics and unoriginal mini-games, but praised its graphics and audio.|$|E
5|$|The Xbox 360 S was {{announced}} at E3 2010 by Microsoft. It is a smaller {{revision of the}} Xbox 360 hardware, which includes either <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> 250GB hard drive or 4GB of Flash storage, 802.11n Wi-Fi, a TOSLINK connector, 5 USB ports and an AUX connector for the Kinect sensor device.|$|E

5|$|The ZX Spectrum +3, {{released}} in 1987, looked {{similar to the}} +2A but featured <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> 3-inch floppy disk drive (like the Amstrad CPC 6128) instead of the tape drive, and was in a black case. It was launched in 1987, initially retailed for £249 and then later £199 and was the only Spectrum capable of running the CP/M operating system without additional hardware.|$|E
5|$|The {{authorized}} {{loudspeaker enclosure}} {{to use with}} a console organ was the Hammond Tone Cabinet, which housed an external amplifier and speaker in a cabinet. The cabinet carried a balanced mono signal along with the necessary mains power directly from the organ, using a six-pin cable. Spinet organs contained <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> power amplifier and loudspeakers, so did not require a tone cabinet.|$|E
5|$|To {{keep costs}} down while {{ensuring}} sufficient longevity, Sega opted to create the platform from popular off-the-shelf components. The first model to be developed was actually the SC-3000, a computer version with <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> keyboard, but when Sega learned of Nintendo's plans to release a games-only console, they began developing the SG-1000 alongside the SC-3000.|$|E

5|$|A few lemurs {{have been}} noted to have {{relatively}} large brains. The extinct Hadropithecus was {{as large as a}} large male baboon and had a comparably sized brain, giving it the largest brain size relative to body size among all prosimians. The aye-aye also has a large brain-to-body ratio, which may indicate a higher level of intelligence. However, despite having <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> tool in the form of its thin, elongated middle finger, which it uses to fish for insect grubs, the aye-aye has tested poorly in the use of extraneous tools.|$|E
5|$|Another {{solution}} to {{the vulnerability of the}} RAF bombers was to fly at night, which was taken up as the primary tactic of Bomber Command. The Mk. X proved {{to be very difficult to}} read at night and bombers that carried it were quickly refitted with the earlier Mk. VII or Mk. IX sight. The Norden was unable to work at night at all; the bomb aimer had to locate the target long in advance of the drop point using <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> telescope and targets were simply not visible at the required distances in low light.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{introduced}} {{their first}} integrated circuit (IC) model, the Concorde, in 1971. The company had stopped manufacturing tonewheel organs entirely by 1975, {{due to increased}} financial inefficiency, and switched to making IC models full-time. Console models included the 8000 Aurora (1976) and 8000M Aurora (1977), which contained drawbars and <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> rotating speaker. Spinet organs included the Romance series, manufactured between 1977 and 1983. In 1979, a Japanese offshoot, Nihon Hammond, introduced the X-5, a portable solid-state clone of the B-3.|$|E
