25|$|Burroughs {{moved into}} a rundown hotel in the Latin Quarter of Paris in 1959 when Naked Lunch was {{still looking for a}} publisher. Tangier, with its {{political}} unrest, and criminals with whom he had become involved, became dangerous to Burroughs. He went to Paris to meet Ginsberg <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> Olympia Press. He left behind a criminal charge which eventually caught up to him to Paris. Paul Lund, a British former career criminal and cigarette smuggler whom Burroughs met in Tangier, was arrested on suspicion of importing narcotics into France. Lund gave up Burroughs, and evidence implicated Burroughs in the importation of narcotics into France. When the Moroccan authorities forwarded their investigation to French officials,Burroughs faced criminal charges in Paris for conspiracy to import opiates. It was during this impending case that Maurice Girodias published Naked Lunch; its appearance helped to get Burroughs a suspended sentence, since a literary career, according to Ted Morgan, is a respected profession in France.|$|E

[...] Comparing Ellis' previous appearances in the series with the version presented in the episode, West stated she is [...] "far worse" [...] as a lucid person, noting how frustration and confusion are her main characteristics.|$|E
