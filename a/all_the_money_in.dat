5|$|The winner Trousselier {{received}} 6950 Francs for his victory. The {{night after}} he won, he drank and gambled with friends, and lost <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money.</b> <b>In</b> later years, Trousselier would not win a Tour de France again, {{but he still}} won eight more stages and finished on the podium in the next year.|$|E
5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly inelastic (Ed = 0), changes in the price do not affect the quantity demanded for the good; raising prices will always cause total revenue to increase. Goods necessary to survival can be classified here; a rational person {{will be willing to}} pay anything for a good if the alternative is death. For example, a person in the desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> his wallet, no matter how much, for a bottle of water if he would otherwise die. His demand is not contingent on the price.|$|E

25|$|Rav Judah {{reported}} in Samuel's name {{an account of}} the rarity of completely Red Cows: When they asked Rabbi Eliezer how far the honor due parents extended, Rabbi Eliezer told of a non-Jew from Ashkelon named Dama son of Nethinah. The Sages offered Dama a profit of 600,000 gold denarii (or Rav Kahana said 800,000 denarii) in exchange for jewels that he had that the Sages could use in the ephod, but as the key to the jewels lay under Dama's father's pillow, Dama declined the offer so as not to trouble his father. The next year, God rewarded Dama by causing a Red Cow to be born in his herd. When the Sages went to buy it, Dama told them that he knew that he could ask for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> the world and they would pay it, but he asked for only the money that he had lost in honoring his father.|$|E
25|$|The next scene {{takes place}} in this back room. Drunk, Tamashima draws his sword and reveals himself as Nippon Daemon in a rousing speech, before {{demanding}} Kōbei hand over <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> the shop. Though Rikimaru and Kozō have made off with 100 ryō, the entire ordeal was a ruse to help Daemon earn Kōbei's trust, and to get himself into the back room. Sōnosuke throws himself between the two, offering his own life instead of that of his father-in-law; Daemon stops, noting that he once had a son who would be roughly Sōnosuke's age. The two older men begin {{to talk about their}} pasts and come to the realization that not only is Daemon Sōnosuke's true father, but Kōbei is in fact Kozō's true father. Both men, for differing reasons, lost their sons at a crowded ritual ceremony at the Hase-dera over a decade prior, and agree to forget about Daemon's criminal scheme as they thank one another for taking care of one another's sons, though Kōbei does ask that Daemon attempt to turn all five of the thieves away from their lives of crime.|$|E

25|$|Ronnie has a brief {{relationship}} with Dot Branning's (June Brown) grandson, Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett) after {{telling him about}} Danielle's death. Ronnie and Roxy buy 27 Albert Square, after deciding that Phil's house is too crowded, but after revealing that she is pregnant to Phil, Ronnie decides to leave. Ronnie returns several months later, as requested by Peggy {{to try to stop}} Phil and Sharon's wedding, revealing that she is five months pregnant with Charlie's baby. She moves back in with Roxy. Dot, disappointed about the idea of her great-grandchild being born out of wedlock, persuades Charlie to propose to Ronnie. She admits that she has killed a man and, in return, he admits that he is not a police officer and has been lying to Dot about Nick Cotton's (John Altman) death. Nick returns to Walford and reveals himself to Dot. Ronnie tells Charlie that she wants him gone. She threatens Nick, saying that he doesn't know what she's capable of. She asks Phil to give her the money stolen from her and Roxy so she can get rid of Nick, but he refuses. Ronnie steals <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> his safe. On their wedding day, Phil finds out about the money, and agrees to kill Nick. He overhears this and angrily cuts the brakes on Ronnie's car. She goes into labour during the wedding reception, and Roxy and Charlie rush her to hospital, but crash the car in the square due to the cut brakes. Ronnie is rushed to hospital in a critical condition, where her son Matthew is delivered by an emergency Caesarean section. She is revived at the last minute, but is placed in a coma for several weeks, before she is finally woken up.|$|E

[...] A fan of Parks and Recreation since its inception, Armisen said he laughed {{as soon as he}} read the script, and found it even funnier during the table read with the cast. After working with Armisen, Rashida Jones described him as [...] "one of the funniest people on the planet".|$|E

[...] After a brief sabbatical from the game subsequent to losing his money, he began to play at a casino in Windsor, Ontario across the Canada–US border from his Detroit-area home. He earned enough to enter contests in the Bahamas and Costa Rica.|$|E

500|$|On {{the sixth}} day of trial, alcohol tax agent Patrick Donoghue testified that, {{in a case}} that Donoghue had investigated, Glasser persuaded a grand jury to reverse itself after {{returning}} an indictment by placing the matter on the pending call indefinitely. Another government witness, bootlegging handyman Ralph Sharp testified that he had paid Kretske $250 in order for Kretske, as prosecutor, to recommend that the charges against him be dismissed (which they were). Frank Hodorowicz, another bootlegger turned government witness, testified that he had paid Kretske $1,300 to recommend the dismissal of two cases and was convicted in the third case after he refused to pay $1,000. After he was indicted the third time, he testified, Glasser declined to intervene on his behalf, saying: [...] "You're going to jail for five years; I can't do anything about it.

On August 4, 2009, Larry Fessenden was announced {{as the director of}} the American remake. Fessenden was later announced that he will not be involved with directing the remake, stating [...] "Working on the script with Guillermo was a very exciting experience, but then I got into a casting miasma and that's where the thing is; I think they're gonna do it another way, actually. So I think I'm out of it. Hopefully they'll still use my script, but I'm not sure I'm directing it anymore". In January 2010, Mark Pellington replaced Larry Fessenden as director of the project.|$|E
500|$|When {{the ninth}} {{syndicated}} season began on September 13, 2010, the format was overhauled. Ten {{questions were asked}} in round one, each assigned one of ten different money amounts which were randomized {{at the beginning of}} the game, as were the questions themselves. The difficulty of the questions was not tied to the dollar value. The dollar values for each question remained hidden until a contestant either provided a correct answer or chose to [...] "jump" [...] the question. The value of each question answered correctly was added to the contestant's bank, for a maximum total of $68,600. A contestant who completed the round successfully could walk at any subsequent point with <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> their bank, or could walk without completing the round with half that amount (e.g., a contestant who banked $30,000 would leave with $15,000). After completing round one, the contestant moved on to a second round of gameplay (the [...] "Classic Millionaire" [...] round), in which four non-categorized questions were played for set non-cumulative values and a correct answer augmented the contestant's winnings to that point, as in the older formats. The shuffle format changes, including the randomization and double-round distribution of questions, were reverted for the fourteenth syndicated season.|$|E

500|$|Two contestants {{compete on}} each episode. On each turn, a Bingo ball {{comes out of}} the hopper and a {{question}} is asked. Each ball has a number from 1 to 75 and a letter in the word [...] "BINGO" [...] printed on it. If the question is answered correctly, the player earns the letter from that ball and the number on the ball is added in dollars to the bank, which starts at $500 (e.g., if G-50 comes out, the bank increases by $50). If the letter is a duplicate already earned by the player, no extra letters are earned. The first player that spells out BINGO from the earned letters wins the game. A Free-Space Ball with a sponsor's logo acts as a wild card in the game. The player who answers a question correctly when that ball is rolled out can choose any letter, and $100 is added to the bank. Two regular games are played. Contestants who win both games win the match and receive <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> the bank. If each contestant wins one game, a five-question tie-breaker game is played. The first question's answer begins with a B, the second question's answer starts with I, and so on. The first to answer three questions correctly wins the money in the bank and goes on to play the Bingo Bonus Board for a chance at $100,000.|$|E

Other associates sympathetic to the U.S. were Trinidad Pardo de Tavera and Benito Legarda, prominent members of Congress; Gregorio Araneta, Aguinaldo's Secretary of Justice; and Felipe Buencamino, Aguinaldo's Secretary of Foreign Affairs.
