5|$|These {{statutes}} {{have been}} upheld as exercises of Congress's Commerce Clause power, {{or in the}} case of the mail fraud and program bribery statutes, the Postal Clause and the Spending Clause, respectively. In the special case where <b>a</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> is the defendant, the Speech or Debate Clause places certain restrictions on the actions that can be prosecuted and proved up. Some commentators have argued that prosecutions of state and local officials under these statutes pose substantial federalism questions, while others argue that the Guarantee Clause provides additional authority for such prosecutions.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. Justice Department {{immediately}} {{tried to}} halt publication, {{on the grounds}} that the information revealed within the papers harmed the national interest. Within the next two weeks, a federal court injunction halted publication in The Times; The Washington Post and several other newspapers began publishing parts of the documents, with some of them also being halted by injunctions; and the whole matter went to the U.S. Supreme Court for arguments. Looking for an alternate publication mechanism, Ellsberg returned to his idea of having <b>a</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> read them, and chose Gravel based on the latter's efforts against the draft; Gravel agreed where previously others had not. Ellsberg arranged for the papers to be given to Gravel on June 26 via an intermediary, Washington Post editor Ben Bagdikian. Gravel used his counter-intelligence experience to choose a midnight transfer in front of the Mayflower Hotel in the center of Washington.|$|E
