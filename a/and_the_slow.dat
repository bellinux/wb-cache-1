5|$|As {{a result}} of this attack, a 4-inch Mark III QF gun was erected on a {{promontory}} overlooking Village Bay, but it never saw action against the enemy. Of greater long-term significance to the islanders were the introduction of regular {{contact with the outside world}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> development of a money-based economy. This made life easier for the St Kildans but also made them less self-reliant. Both were factors in the evacuation of the island little more than a decade later.|$|E
5|$|The {{lacrimal}} fossa, {{a depression}} in the skull, {{is located on the}} upper surface of the skull in most lorisids, but Schwartz found that it was further to the back, inside the orbit (eye socket) in the false potto <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> loris. Sarmiento found this feature in 3 out of 11 pottos examined. The coronoid process of the mandible is said to be more hooked in the false potto than in the potto and slow loris.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, the BlackBerry Bold 9700 {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. The smartphone was commended for its design and most changes were favored, {{such as the}} trackpad. However, critics were ambivalent towards the dated software <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> browser, and some concluded that the device did not set itself apart from previous models.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{agreed that}} the game's {{graphics}} were good, enjoyed Uematsu's score, and several praised the concepts behind the Job and leveling systems. Alongside this, unanimous criticism was laid against the gameplay pace, its convoluted interface, bugs and glitches, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> pace of the story. It was generally seen as a great disappointment both as an MMORPG and a mainline entry in the Final Fantasy series. Later, {{as part of an}} interview concerning the game's later development, 1UP.com commented that subsequent patches and overhauls had turned the game into something more playable.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Taylor (1992) pointed {{that the}} {{relatively}} high dependency ratio <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> demographic transition in Argentina led to a reliance on foreign capital to offset the resulting low savings rate. From the 1930s onwards, the accumulation of capital was hampered by {{the relatively high}} prices of (mostly imported) capital goods, which {{was caused by the}} industrial policy of import substitution, in contrast with the export-led growth favoured by Canada. Other distorting factors behind the high relative prices of capital goods include the multiple exchange rates, the black market for foreign currencies, the depreciation of the national currency and high customs tariffs. This resulted in a lower capital intensity, which led to lower rates of labour productivity.|$|E
5|$|On January 3, 2008, IGN {{reported}} that Valve employees {{had created a}} thread on Valve's website forums for players to list the problems they had encountered and to suggest fixes, which caused speculation that a patch was being planned to address the issues in the PlayStation 3 version, such as the frame rate issues, the connection problems in Team Fortress 2, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> loading times in Portal. A patch for the PlayStation 3 version was later released in North America on March 19, 2008 and in Europe a short while after that; however, it {{made no mention of}} fixing frame rate issues or slow loading times.|$|E
40|$|We study <b>the</b> <b>slowing</b> down of {{particle}} beams {{passing through the}} dusty plasma with power-law kappa-distributions. Three plasma components, electrons, ions and dust particles, can have different kappa-parameter. We derive the deceleration factor (the velocity moment equation) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>slowing</b> down time of a test particle, <b>and</b> numerically study <b>the</b> <b>slowing</b> down properties of an electron beam, a proton beam and a dust particle beam, respectively, in the kappa-distributed dusty plasma. We show that <b>the</b> <b>slowing</b> down properties {{of particle}} beams depend strongly on the kappa-parameters of <b>the</b> plasma components, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dust component plays a dominant role in <b>the</b> <b>slowing</b> down. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>slowing</b> down also depends on mass <b>and</b> charge of <b>the</b> dust particles in the dusty plasma.

5|$|Essex reacted {{by making}} a {{surprise}} attack on the Royalist lines at dawn, capturing several pieces of high ground and leaving Charles on the back foot. A series of Royalist attacks led to {{a large number of}} casualties <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> retreat of Essex's force, which was driven from the central hill and almost encircled; Essex succeeded in rallying his infantry, however, and pushed forward in a counter-attack. The slowing of this counter-attack {{in the face of the}} Royalist cavalry forced Essex to send for reinforcements, who, while marching to him, were attacked and forced to retreat. This left a hole in the Parliamentarian line, dividing the army into two wings through which the Royalists hoped to pass, splitting the Parliamentarians and allowing Charles's troops to encircle and defeat the enemy. In line with this, the Royalists moved forward to press the attack, but were forced to halt by the London Trained Bands. With night falling, the battle ended, and both exhausted armies disengaged. The next morning, low on ammunition, the Royalists were forced to allow Essex to pass and continue his retreat to London.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton's {{original}} {{intention was}} to sail down to Cape Town, visiting the main South Atlantic islands on the way. From Cape Town, Quest would head for the Enderby Land coast of Antarctica where, once in the ice, it would explore the coastline towards Coats Land in the Weddell Sea. At {{the end of the}} summer season the ship would visit South Georgia before returning to Cape Town for refitting and preparation for the second year's work. The ship's performance in the early stages of the voyage disrupted this schedule. Serious problems with the engine necessitated a week's stay in Lisbon, and further stops in Madeira and the Cape Verde Islands. These delays <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> speed of the ship led Shackleton to decide that it would be necessary to sacrifice entirely the visits to the South Atlantic islands, and instead he turned the ship towards Rio de Janeiro, where the engine could receive a thorough overhaul. Quest reached Rio on 22 November 1921.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{severity}} of asbestos-related diseases, the material has extremely widespread use in many areas.

25|$|All of the ARBs, {{except for}} {{valsartan}} and olmesartan, are metabolized {{in some way}} by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme 2C9, that {{is found in the}} human liver. CYP2C9 is for example responsible for the metabolizing of losartan to EXP 3174 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> metabolizing of valsartan and candesartan to their inactive metabolites. Telmisartan is, on the other hand, in part metabolized by glucuronidation and olmesartan is excreted as the unchanged drug.|$|E
25|$|Until 1950 {{the line}} was a freight-only service. The first {{passenger}} service launched in 1950 and connected Esquel with Buenos Aires (arriving at Constitución station), changing trains at Jacobacci. Passengers would occupy loose wooden benches around a stove {{which could be used}} for light cooking and above all to prepare mate and keep warm. The bends of the line in the Andean foothills <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> speed of the network allowed passengers to walk alongside the train on certain sections along the 14-hour journey.|$|E
25|$|The {{section was}} later reduced to double tracks between Shields Junction and Arkleston Junction during the mid 1960s {{as part of}} the resignalling works {{associated}} with the railway electrification of what is now known as the Inverclyde Line services between Glasgow Central and Gourock and Wemyss Bay, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> lines were removed between Arkleston Junction and Wallneuk Junction (the point of divergence of the Ayr line and the Greenock line) during the 1980s electrification of the Ayrshire Coast Line.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the amount}} of traffic <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> process of legging, the Harecastle Tunnel was {{becoming}} a major bottleneck on the canal. It was decided to commission a second tunnel to be built by Thomas Telford. Due to advances in engineering, it took just three years to build, and was completed in 1827. It had a towpath so that horses could pull the boats through the tunnel. After its construction it was used in conjunction with the Brindley tunnel, with each tunnel taking traffic in opposite directions.|$|E
25|$|The {{tradeoff}} {{comes in}} terms of power and accuracy; AA #2 is designed for small cases, and will burn inconsistently in the large 44 Magnum case. AA #9, however, will fill the case much better, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> burn rate of AA #9 is ideal for magnum handgun rounds, producing 20% higher velocities (at maximum levels) while still producing less pressure than the fast burning AA #2. A medium burning powder might actually be a better choice, as it could split the difference in powder weights while delivering more power and accuracy than the fastest powder.|$|E
25|$|Bedřich Smetana, another Czech, wrote a piano trio {{and string}} quartet, {{both of which}} {{incorporate}} native Czech rhythms and melodies. In Russia, Russian folk music permeated {{the works of the}} late 19th-century composers. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky uses a typical Russian folk dance in the final movement of his string sextet, Souvenir de Florence, Op. 70. Alexander Borodin's second string quartet contains references to folk music, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> Nocturne movement of that quartet recalls Middle Eastern modes that were current in the Muslim sections of southern Russia. Edvard Grieg used the musical style of his native Norway in his string quartet in G minor, Op. 27.|$|E
