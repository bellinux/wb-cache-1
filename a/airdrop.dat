50|$|In June 2011, Le Figaro {{reported}} that France secretly <b>airdropped</b> significant quantities of {{arms in the}} Nafusa Mountains for the Berber rebels. The arms included assault rifles, machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades, and European-made MILAN anti-tank missiles. The French government later confirmed the reports, stating that the <b>airdrops</b> had started in June. On 5 July, French defense minister Gérard Longuet declared that the <b>airdrops</b> had ceased.|$|R

5|$|By dawn, the Japanese attack had subsided. Over 750Japanese {{dead were}} counted {{in and around}} the American positions. No prisoners were taken. American {{casualties}} were 61dead, and 244wounded, including nine dead and 38wounded Seabees. The 2ndSquadron, 5thCavalry and the 40th Naval Construction Battalion received Presidential Unit Citations. General Chase called for an <b>airdrop</b> of ammunition, prodigious quantities of which had been expended during the night, and had Warramunga fire on the native skidway.|$|E
5|$|In June, the ZNDH finally {{received}} from Germany the long-promised <b>airdrop</b> containers for aerial resupply of ammunition and other equipment, constantly in need by besieged and encircled garrisons {{all over the}} NDH. They were immediately {{put to good use}} and eased the work of the already overstretched ZNDH. The Dornier Do 17s of the ZNDH proved to be especially well suited for such tasks. June also saw Kren returned to his previous position as head of the ZNDH.|$|E
5|$|The raiders {{rested on}} 1 December and {{received}} some provisions by <b>airdrop.</b> On 2 December, Carlson fanned out his patrols around the Lunga River. Company B discovered 10Japanese camped {{by the river}} and killed all of them. None of the other companies encountered any Japanese, but one discovered another 75mm mountain gun. Late in the day, Carlson received orders to terminate the patrol and take his troops into the Lunga perimeter the next day.|$|E

5|$|At dawn on September 5 the North Koreans attacked. The {{engineers}} repulsed {{this attack}} but suffered some casualties. Ammunition was running low and three US C-47 Skytrain aircraft {{came over the}} area to make an <b>airdrop.</b> The planes mistakenly dropped their bundles of ammunition and food on the North Korean positions. Immediately after the airdrops, two F-51 Mustang fighter planes came over and attacked D Company, also in error. Soon after this aerial attack, North Korean troops attacked the positions.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of September 2 Schmitt radioed 1st Battalion for an <b>airdrop</b> of supplies. A US plane attempted the drop, but the perimeter was so small and the slopes so steep that virtually all the supplies went into North Korean hands. The men in the perimeter did, however, recover from a drop made later at 19:00 some supplies and ammunition. Private First Class Joseph R. Ouellette, of H Company, left the perimeter to gather weapons, ammunition, and grenades from the North Korean dead. On several occasions he was attacked, and on one such occasion a North Korean soldier suddenly attacked Ouellette, who killed the North Korean in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
5|$|The {{first flight}} by an RAAF C-17 to Antarctica was {{conducted}} in November 2015. The aircraft transported supplies for the Australian Antarctic Division from Hobart to Wilkins Runway, and its crew practised evacuating casualties from Wilkins after the cargo was unloaded. This flight {{was reported to have}} been the first time the RAAF had flown missions to the Australian Antarctic Territory since the Antarctic Flight was withdrawn in 1963. Further flights occurred in early 2016. A trial winter <b>airdrop</b> was also conducted at Casey Station in June that year. In September 2017 air-to-air refuelling was used to enable a Globemaster to drop supplies at Davis Station.|$|E

5000|$|Auto Extraction <b>airdrops</b> use an {{extraction}} parachute to {{pull the}} load out of the aircraft end of the airplane. In this method, an extraction parachute is deployed behind the aircraft which pulls the load out and cargo parachutes are deployed to slow the load. Extraction drops are usually Low-Velocity <b>airdrops,</b> with rare exceptions (e.g. Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System).|$|R
5|$|The iPhone 5S was {{the first}} Apple device to ship with iOS 7, which {{introduced}} a revamped visual appearance and other new features. Designed by Jonathan Ive, iOS 7 departed from skeuomorphic elements used by previous versions of iOS {{in favor of a}} flat, colorful design. Among new software features introduced to the iPhone 5S were <b>AirDrop,</b> an ad-hoc Wi-Fi sharing platform; Control Center, a control panel containing a number of commonly used functions; and iTunes Radio, an internet radio service. Earphones known as EarPods were included with the 5S, and Apple released accessories including a case and a dock.|$|E
5|$|A {{shortage}} of 9mm ammunition for the Owen Guns was discovered, apparently because the ammunition {{was in the}} LST {{that had not been}} completely unloaded. An emergency <b>airdrop</b> was requested at 10:30. In Port Moresby, the 1st Air Maintenance Company prepared 30 parachutes, each attached to two boxes containing 2,560 rounds of 9mm ammunition, a total of 153,600 rounds. This was loaded onto three USAAF B-24 Liberator bombers at Wards Airfield that took off at 16:55. They arrived over the Finschhafen area after dark at 19:15, where a drop zone in a Kunai patch was marked by men holding hand torches. Of the 115,000 rounds that were dropped, about 112,000 were recovered.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the scale}} of the cyclone damage, the {{government}} issued an international appeal for assistance. As a result, the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs provided a grant of $30,000. UNICEF provided about $48,000 to secure drug kits for children impacted by the cyclone. The Red Cross of Seychelles donated about one tonne of clothing and 20tonnes of tuna, and the Red Cross of Réunion sent drugs to Madagascar. The government of France also sent a crew from Réunion to Madagascar to assist in the aftermath, as well as a plane to <b>airdrop</b> the aid. The governments of Germany, Japan, France, the United Kingdom each donated about $100,000 to Madagascar, while the United States provided about $25,000 and 500tons of food. The government of Japan also sent 2,040blankets and 10tents. By February18, the total contributions by the international community reached about $3million.|$|E

5|$|Twelve C-130Js are {{operated}} by No.37 Squadron, also based at Richmond under No.84 Wing. The aircraft are generally crewed by two pilots and a loadmaster, and are tasked with medium tactical airlift in Australia and overseas, transporting troops and cargo, and conducting medical evacuation, search-and-rescue, and <b>airdrop</b> missions. No.285 Squadron manages the full-flight mission simulator (FFMS) used to convert aircrew to the C-130J, {{as well as}} decommissioned Hercules airframes used for loadmaster training. It also employs computer-based training tools and is allocated flying aircraft from No.37 Squadron when required. As well as training aircrew new to the C-130J, the FFMS (maintained by CAE Australia) is employed for existing aircrew to maintain their currency.|$|E
5|$|In {{mainland}} China, officials used {{helicopters to}} <b>airdrop</b> relief goods to Guangdong. By {{three days after}} the storm, workers distributed 2,000tents and 1,000beds. Once the floodwaters dropped, residents returned their homes to clean up the mud and damage. Farm officials in Guangdong used 50tons of disinfectant {{to prevent the spread of}} disease, while the provincial government allocated ¥240million (CNY, US$35million) for rebuilding. About 1,000soldiers worked to clean debris and animal carcasses from the reservoir providing drinking water to Maoming. The collapsed dam in Guangdong was later torn down due to being structurally deficient. Zijin Mining, the owner of the dam, had to sell a mine to pay for compensation and fines related to the incident, which ultimately totaled ¥245million (CNY, US$38.7million). After the storm, the Red Cross Society of China provided ¥1million (CNY, US$148,000) to localities affected hardest by the storm, as well as distributing mosquito nets, water purifiers, food, and clothing.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, {{travelling}} through unmapped areas, {{men took}} {{up to six}} weeks just to reach their destinations. They often had to carry all their supplies, arms and their radio, often {{with the help of}} Papuan carriers. Teams of two or three spotters typically maintained the stations, each led by an acting non-commissioned-officer (NCO), working in isolation from friendly forces in remote locations for extended periods of time. The teams survived on limited rations, usually supplemented by native food sources. Once their initial supplies were expended they usually had to fend for themselves, although stations were also sometimes re-supplied by <b>airdrop</b> or by sea, but usually only {{in the event of a}} failure of mission essential equipment, or when petrol for the radios ran low. Spotting stations were usually only lightly armed, being usually equipped with just one Owen Gun with 600 rounds for the NCO in charge, and a rifle with only 50 rounds for each other man.|$|E

5|$|Making {{matters worse}} for the defenders, any {{aircraft}} that braved the weather and attempted to land was subject to North Vietnamese anti-aircraft fire on its way in for a landing. Once the aircraft touched down, it became the target of any number of NVA artillery or mortar crews. The aircrew then {{had to contend with}} anti-aircraft fire on the way out. As a result, 65 percent of all supplies were delivered by paradrops delivered by C-130 aircraft, mostly by the US Air Force, whose crews had significantly more experience in <b>airdrop</b> tactics than Marine air crews. The most dramatic supply delivery system used at Khe Sanh was the Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System (LAPES), in which palletized supplies were pulled out of the cargo bay of a low-flying transport aircraft by means of an attached parachute. The pallet slid to a halt on the airstrip while the aircraft never had to actually land. The US Air Force delivered 14,356 tons of supplies to Khe Sanh by air (8,120 tons by paradrop). 1st Marine Aircraft Wing records claim that the unit delivered 4,661 tons of cargo into KSCB.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August, the Half Flight was {{augmented}} by four Martinsyde S1s and redesignated No.30 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps (RFC). The squadron moved into Kut following the city's capture by the Allies during the Battle of Es Sinn in September; {{for his part}} in the operation, Petre was again mentioned in despatches. Over the following two months, however, both Treloar and White were captured and became prisoners of war, leaving Petre as the only pilot remaining from the original Half Flight. Around the time of the Battle of Ctesiphon in November, he devised an implement shaped like a small garden rake that allowed him to accurately measure ground distances from the air in order to better map the desert terrain. During the Siege of Kut between December 1915 and April 1916, he flew a series of missions using crude parachutes to <b>airdrop</b> grain supplies (and a millstone for grinding), medical supplies and equipment to the town's entrapped garrison, which included nine of his AFC mechanics.|$|E
5|$|The C-130Js {{have been}} updated since {{entering}} service. All {{of the aircraft}} were fitted with radar warning receivers {{by the end of}} 2012, and it is planned to equip the Hercules with Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures systems by 2016. As of 2015, the Hercules' communications capabilities were also to be updated by fitting the aircraft with satellite communications equipment and the equipment necessary to allow them to use the Link 16 data exchange network. At this time the C-130s were also to be fitted with new high-speed <b>airdrop</b> ramps at the rear of their cabin, and will be cleared to drop larger loads. The C-130J's operating software has also been upgraded over time, leading to improved performance. The RAAF is participating in the development of further software enhancements. During 2016 all of the C-130Js were fitted with advanced satellite communications systems that allowed the aircraft, and embarked troops, to be retasked while in flight. As part of this modification the aircraft were fitted with an additional crew station, and they carry a fourth crew member when necessary to handle complex communications tasks.|$|E
