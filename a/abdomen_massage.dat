50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the experiment, Hudson and his colleague selected 141 patients having symptoms and signs for urinary obstruction. However, as the experiment progressed, patients were selected randomly. They were not informed that the biopsies searching for cancer had possible side effects, i.e., rectal tearing and impotence. According to Robert Aronowitz, before the biopsy, the patients underwent a physical examination including blood and urine assays, x-rays of the <b>abdomen,</b> <b>massage</b> of the prostate for cytology and intravenous pyelograms. For the biopsy, a part of the prostate measuring 2.5 × 1.0 × 0.5 centimeters was removed; one half was sent to a pathology laboratory to get tested while the other half was retained for permanent preparation. If the results showed cancer, a perineal prostatectomy and orchiectomy was performed on the men, followed by diethylstilbestrol treatment. The homeless were targeted for these biopsies because they were painful and untested, and less vulnerable populations would not volunteer.|$|E
40|$|In most settings, sputum is not {{routinely}} {{collected for}} microbiological diagnosis from children with lower respiratory disease. To evaluate {{whether it is}} feasible and diagnostically useful to collect sputum in the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study, we reviewed the literature on induced sputum procedures. Protocols for induced sputum in children were collated from published reports and experts on respiratory disease and reviewed by an external advisory group for recommendation in the PERCH study. The advisory group compared 6 protocols: 4 followed a nebulization technique using hypertonic saline, and 2 followed a chest or <b>abdomen</b> <b>massage</b> technique. Grading systems for specimen quality were evaluated. Collecting sputum from children with lower respiratory tract illness is feasible and is performed around the world. An external advisory group recommended that sputum be collected from children hospitalized with severe and very severe pneumonia who participate in the PERCH study provided no contraindications exist. PERCH selected the nebulization technique using hypertonic saline...|$|E
40|$|Context: Premature {{ejaculation}} (PE) is {{the most}} common sexual disorder of young males. Even though there are number of treatment options available for PE, patient′s satisfaction and drug side effects remain to be a problem. Non-pharmacological treatment options like Yoga and Naturopathy have been implicated in sexual fulfillment, pleasure and efficacy of some of these approaches has been established in previous studies. Aim: To assess the efficacy of certain yogic and naturopathic procedures in the management of PE. Materials and Methods: A total of 12 patients with PE satisfying the DSM IV TR diagnostic criteria were selected and allotted into two groups, Yoga group and Naturopathic group by following the randomization method. In the Yoga group, various asanas, mudra, bandha and pranayama were practiced 1 hour daily for 21 days. In the Naturopathy group, lower <b>abdomen</b> <b>massage</b> and steam bath, hip bath and lingasnana, mud pack on lower abdomen, and acupressure were done 1 hour daily for 21 days. Criteria of assessment were based on the scoring of Premature Ejaculation Severity Index (PESI). Statistical analysis was done by using paired and unpaired " t" tests. Results: In the Yoga group (n = 6), 7. 3 % relief was observed (P 0. 05) on the total score of PESI. There was no significant difference (P > 0. 05) found in between the two groups. Conclusion: Both Yoga and Naturopathic procedures didn′t provide relief (< 25 %) on total score of PESI...|$|E

50|$|Positive {{pressure}} in the air filled spaces results from reduced barometric pressure during the depressurization phase of an EVA. It can cause abdominal distension, ear or sinus pain, decreased hearing, and dental or jaw pain. Abdominal distension can be treated with extending the <b>abdomen,</b> gentle <b>massage</b> and encourage passing flatus. Ear and sinus pressure can be relieved with passive release of positive pressure. Pretreatment for susceptible individuals can include oral and nasal decongestants, or oral and nasal steroids.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the alleviating effects of aromatherapy massage and acetaminophen on menstrual pain in Korean high school girls. Subjects {{were divided into two}} groups: the aromatherapy massage (treatment) group (= 32) and the acetaminophen (control) group (= 23). Aromatherapy massage was performed on subjects in the treatment group. The <b>abdomen</b> was <b>massaged</b> once using clary sage, marjoram, cinnamon, ginger, and geranium in a base of almond oil. The level of menstrual pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale at baseline and twenty-four hours afterward. The reduction of menstrual pain was significantly higher in the aromatherapy group than in the acetaminophen group. Using multiple regression, aromatherapy massage was found to be more highly associated with reduction in the level of menstrual pain than acetaminophen. These finding suggest that aromatherapy massage may be an effective treatment for menstrual pain in high school girls. However, it could not be verified whether the positive effects derived from the aromatherapy, the massage, or both. Further rigorous studies should be conducted using more objective measures...|$|R
40|$|Determinou-se a ação inflamatória aguda do tiopental {{intraperitoneal}} (IP) utilizando-se 72 ratos, divididos em grupo-tratado (40 mg/kg de tiopental a 2, 5 % IP) e grupo-controle (0, 25 ml de solução fisiológica IP). Para determinar o processo inflamatório, colheu-se o lavado peritoneal às 2, 6, 12, 24 e 48 h após a inoculação. Os animais foram anestesiados com isoflurano e submetidos à eutanásia por secção dos vasos cervicais. Administraram-se 5 ml de solução fisiológica heparinizada por via IP e, após homogeneização, divulsionou-se o peritôneo e colheu-se a amostra. Determinaram-se a dosagem de proteínas plasmáticas (PP), a contagem global (CGL) e a diferencial (CDL) de leucócitos. Não foi observada diferença na PP entre os grupos em nenhum momento exceto às 2 h. Entre os momentos, a dosagem foi superior às 6 e 12 h nos dois grupos. Não houve diferença entre os grupos para a CGL. Entre os momentos, a CGL diferiu dos demais às 6 h em ambos os grupos. Verificou-se o mesmo perfil para a CDL entre os grupos exceto para os eosinófilos às 6 h. Entre os momentos, os valores foram diferentes em relação aos neutrófilos em ambos os grupos, às 6 e 12 h. Observou-se reação inflamatória aguda no processo provavelmente desencadeada pela ação mecânica da injeção. A eosinofilia observada no grupo-tratado após 6 h sugere uma certa ação irritante do tiopental. The acute inflammatory {{action of}} thiopental intraperitoneal (IP) in rats was studied. Seventy two animals were divided in treated (40 mg/kg of thiopental, 2. 5 % IP) and control (0. 25 ml of saline solution IP) rats. In order {{to evaluate the}} inflammatory process, peritoneal fluid was taken at 2 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h e 48 h after drug administration. The animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and submitted to euthanasia through cervical vessels section. Five millilitres of heparinized saline solution were injected IP, homogenized by <b>abdomen</b> <b>massage</b> and then withdrawn. Plasma protein (PP), global leukocyte count (GLC) and differential leukocyte count (DLC) were analysed. No difference in PP intergroup at any moment was observed, but at 2 h. Intragroup, PP was higher between 6 and 12 h in both groups. There was no statistical difference of GLC intergroup. There was a difference (P< 0. 05) of GLC results between groups at 6 h post-injection. There was a similar pattern of DLC intergroups, except eosinophil cells at 6 h. Intragroup cell counts of neutrophils were different (P< 0. 05) in both groups at 6 and 12 h. The acute inflammatory reaction observed was probably trigged by the mechanically action of injection. The eosinophilia observed in treated group after 6 h suggests some irritant action of thiopental...|$|E

30|$|For obtaining peritoneal mast cells, three rats (250  ±  20  g) were {{individually}} euthanized with CO 2. The <b>abdomens</b> were gently <b>massaged</b> {{for approximately}} 90  s, {{and then an}} incision approximately 5  cm in length was cut in the peritoneal cavities, which were carefully opened. The cavities were washed prior to the injection of 20  mL of DMEM (Gibco) containing 12  U/mL of heparin, as described by Deus-de-Oliveira et al. (2011). The fluid containing peritoneal cells was aspirated with a Pasteur pipette. The fluid from the first rat was used for washing the second, and so on, to enrich {{the content of the}} wash with mast cells. The final content of the collected peritoneal fluid, approximately 15  mL, was transferred to Petri plates and incubated for 30  min at 37  °C to separate the mast cells from the macrophages. Two-thirds of the upper layer were then aspirated and discarded. The supernatant (approximately 4 – 5  mL) enriched with mast cells (~ 1.8  ×  105 mast cells/mL) was separated into aliquots of 100  µL in Eppendorf tubes.|$|R
40|$|The role of midwife at {{the birth}} {{management}} techniques Frederick Leboyer A birth {{is an event}} of a great importance not only for a woman but also for a child, who {{should be taken into}} consideration as well. According to Frederick Leboyer, it is important to welcome a newborn into life in the best way possible, as the birth has a major impact {{on the rest of the}} newborn´s life. Frederick Leboyer, a French gyneacologist and obstetrician, has made an assertion that birth trauma should be minimized and maximum ephasis should be laid on a newborn child. The theoretical part of my bachelor thesis deals with Frederick Leboyer´s birthing method and the role of a birth attendant performing a childbirth in accordance with the Leboyer´s method. The birth according to Leboyer is divided into an obstetric and a paediatric part. The obstetric part includes the psychological preparation of the mother, silence during the birth, patience, attention, deep concentration and birthing techniques. The paediatric part includes the observation of the beginning of the newborn´s breathing, a postponed cut of the umbilical cord, the newborn´s back massage and bathing of the newborn after giving birth. The purpose of the bachelor thesis research part was to discover whether any elements of the Leboyer´s method are incorporated in birthing at the present time and whether mothers-to-be, given the possibility, would be agreeable to give birth according to Leboyer´s method. Additionally, midwives were asked for their opinion about the method. The participatory action research was done during observing a number of birthings which took place at the Departments of Gynecology and Obstetrics of several chosen hospitals. In addition, semi-standardized interview with midwives, who work at the hospitals, and their clients, who were interviewed after giving birth, is included in the research. The aim of the research was to discover to which degree is Leboyer´s method incorporated in delivery rooms. On the basis of this aim a research question was set: ?How is the method used during birthing in delivery rooms?? It was discovered that, in the hospitals where the research was done, some of Leboyer´s techniques, such as to lay a newborn on the mother´s <b>abdomen,</b> a <b>massage</b> of the newborn and the newborn´s presence by his mother during the whole stay in the delivery room, are used. This bachelor thesis might serve as study material for those who study midwifery and as informational material about the technique for birth attendants and mothers-to-be in Czech hospitals. This bachelor thesis may as well serve as inspiration for creating a Leboyer-based norm for birthing practices...|$|R
