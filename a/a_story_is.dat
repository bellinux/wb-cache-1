5|$|Gyromancer is {{a puzzle}} and {{role-playing}} video game developed by PopCap Games {{in collaboration with}} Square Enix. In the game, the player moves through a map of an enchanted forest, battling monsters using their own summoned monsters through a puzzle-game battle based on PopCap's Bejeweled Twist. In these battles, the player rotates groups of four in a grid of gems to line up three or more jewels of the same color; when enough lines have been created damage is dealt to the enemy. Between battles, <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> told {{through a series of}} cutscenes, while the player and the summoned monsters gain experience and power using role-playing game elements.|$|E

5|$|O'Hara {{married her}} third husband, Charles F. Blair, Jr., 11 years her senior, on 12 March 1968. Blair, an immensely popular figure, {{was a pioneer}} of transatlantic aviation, a former brigadier general of the US Air Force, a former chief pilot at Pan Am, and founder {{and head of the}} U.S. Virgin Islands airline Antilles Air Boats. A few years after her {{marriage}} to Blair, O'Hara, for the most part, retired from acting. In the special features section to the DVD release of The Quiet Man, <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> recounted that O'Hara retired after longtime collaborators John Wayne and John Ford teased her about being married but not being a good, stay-at-home housewife, though Blair himself wanted her to retire from acting and help run his business. Blair died in 1978 while flying a Grumman Goose for his airline from St. Croix to St. Thomas, crashing after an engine failure. O'Hara was elected CEO and president of the airline, with the added distinction of becoming the first woman president of a scheduled airline in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|Kilmaurs {{was famous}} for its kale which was an {{important}} foodstuff. <b>A</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> told of how a neighbouring village offered to pay a generous price for some kale seeds, an offer too good to turn down. The cunning locals agreed, however a gentle roasting on a shovel over a coal fire ensured that they never germinated.|$|E
25|$|In folklore, when {{a custom}} {{is too old}} for its origins to be remembered, <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> often devised to rationalise what would {{otherwise}} be baffling. However the ‘official’ story of the Hood's origins are not that unlikely. There are parallels between the Hood and bog burials in Europe.

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> {{told of a}} cricketer who had {{regarded}} Fuller Pilch as {{the final}} word in batting, being taken in his old age to see Mr. Grace bat for the first time.

'Why', he said, 'this man scores continuously from balls that old Fuller would have been thankful to stop'.|$|E

In fact the dragons were made of wood painted gold, and simply rotted away with the ravages of time. The walls of the building are composed of brick. The staircase, 253 steps, is in the centre of the building. During the Second World War holes were cut in each floor to allow for drop-testing of model bombs.|$|E
25|$|The narrator's {{standards}} for {{what constitutes a}} cliffhanger seem broader than in modern literature. While in many cases <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> cut off with the hero {{in danger of losing}} his life or another kind of deep trouble, {{in some parts of the}} full text Scheherazade stops her narration in the middle of an exposition of abstract philosophical principles or complex points of Islamic philosophy, and in one case during a detailed description of human anatomy according to Galen—and in all these cases turns out to be justified in her belief that the king's curiosity about the sequel would buy her another day of life.|$|E

25|$|Tchaikovsky {{is said to}} {{have argued}} with a friend who wagered that the {{composer}} could not write a melody based on a one-octave scale in sequence. Tchaikovsky asked if it mattered whether the notes were in ascending or descending order, and was assured it did not. This resulted in the Adagio from the Grand pas de deux, which, in the ballet, nearly always immediately follows the Waltz of the Flowers. <b>A</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> also told that Tchaikovsky's sister had died shortly before he began composition of the ballet, and that his sister's death influenced him to compose a melancholy, descending scale melody for the adagio of the Grand Pas de Deux.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> told of {{the young}} duke of Burgundy, Fénelon's pupil, who was then only eleven years old, sending 50 louis to La Fontaine as a present of his own motion. But, though La Fontaine {{recovered}} for the time, he was broken by age and infirmity, and his new hosts had to nurse rather than to entertain him, which they did very carefully and kindly. He did a little more work, completing his Fables among other things; {{but he did not}} survive Madame de la Sablière much more than two years, dying on 13 April 1695 in Paris, at the age of seventy-three. When the Père Lachaise Cemetery opened in Paris, La Fontaine's remains were moved there. His wife survived him nearly fifteen years.|$|E
25|$|Mote-hill or Torran Mhoid in Scottish Gaelic. Balliemore, near Castle Roy. The {{title of}} Laird of Abernethy {{went with the}} {{possession}} of the moot hill and <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> told of one Earl of Moray who feued out all the other lands of Abernethy, but would not part with the moot hill, even if the top was covered with golden guineas. Another story tells of a Baron Baillie of Balliemore who took earth from the local churchyard and spread it onto his fields. He was persuaded to stop but later died from apoplexy while on the moot hill, because although he had stopped stealing the earth, he was still stealing it in his heart and God had punished him accordingly. There was a Drowning pool here where witches and female criminals were drowned.|$|E

25|$|The {{setting of}} Lullaby is {{constantly}} changing. In both {{the present tense}} narration and the story he is reflecting on, Streator is constantly moving in pursuit of something. He works {{in a big city}} atmosphere and lives in an apartment surrounded by other tenants who become symbolic of everything Streator hates. Soon after he meets Helen, they start their cross-country mission. Most of the towns they end up in are small, nowhere places that seem to represent the emptiness that the culling song creates in people lives. Similarly, the trucker stops that Streator and Helen drive through in their present-day adventure are representative of how the stories that they are chasing are temporary. The idea that <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> always told ‘after the fact’ seems to hint at a bigger picture: humans are a victim of their past.|$|E
500|$|Bruce Shapiro of Columbia University {{said that}} an engaged and empathetic {{reporter}} will {{be concerned about}} inflicting new trauma on the victim: [...] "I do think that when the emotional valence of <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> this high, {{you really have to}} verify it." [...] He also explained that experienced reporters often work only with women who feel strong enough to deal with the due diligence required to bring the article to publication.|$|E

500|$|Erichtho is also {{mentioned}} by {{name in the}} first book of Dante Aligheri's Divine Comedy, Inferno: in Canto IX, Dante and Virgil are initially denied access to the gates of Dis, and so Dante, doubting his guide and hoping for confirmation, asks Virgil if he has ever travelled to the depths of Hell before. Virgil responds in the affirmative, explaining {{that at one point}} he had journeyed to the lowest circle of Hell on behest of Erichtho in order to retrieve a soul for one of her necromantic rites. Simon A. Gilson notes that such <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> [...] "without precedent in medieval sources, and highly problematic".|$|E
500|$|Wagner-Martin {{speculates that}} Hemingway may {{have wanted to}} have a weak or {{negative}} hero as defined by Edith Wharton, but he had no experience creating a hero or protagonist. [...] At that point his fiction consisted of extremely short stories, not one of which featured a hero. The hero changed during the writing of The Sun Also Rises: first the matador was the hero, then Cohn was the hero, then Brett, and finally Hemingway realized [...] "maybe there is not any hero at all. Maybe <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> better without any hero." [...] Balassi believes that in eliminating other characters as the protagonist, Hemingway brought Jake indirectly into the role of the novel's hero.|$|E
500|$|Wordsworth {{acquired}} {{a copy of}} the antiquarian and churchman Thomas Percy's (1729–1811) collection of British ballads Reliques of Ancient English Poetry (1765) in Hamburg a few months before he began to compose the series. The influence of the traditional English folk ballad is evident in the metre, rhythm and structure of [...] "She dwelt". It follows the variant ballad stanza a4–b3–a4–b3, and in keeping with ballad tradition tells a dramatic story. As Durrant observed, [...] "To confuse the mode of the 'Lucy' poems with that of the love lyric is to overlook their structure, in which, as in the traditional ballad, <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> told as boldly and briefly as possible."
