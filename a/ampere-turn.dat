An example would be a magnet with a straight cylindrical core like the one shown at the top of this article. For electromagnets (or permanent magnets) with well defined 'poles' where the field lines emerge from the core, the force between two electromagnets can be found using the 'Gilbert model' which assumes the magnetic field is produced by fictitious 'magnetic charges' on the surface of the poles, with pole strength m and units of <b>Ampere-turn</b> meter.

5000|$|Magnetic {{circuits}} can {{be solved}} for the flux in each branch by application of the magnetic equivalent of Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) for pure source/resistance circuits. Specifically, whereas KVL states that the voltage excitation applied to a loop {{is equal to the}} sum of the voltage drops (resistance times current) around the loop, the magnetic analogue states that the magnetomotive force (achieved from <b>ampere-turn</b> excitation) is equal to the sum of MMF drops (product of flux and reluctance) across the rest of the loop. (If there are multiple loops, the current in each branch {{can be solved}} through a matrix equation—much as a matrix solution for mesh circuit branch currents is obtained in loop analysis—after which the individual branch currents are obtained by adding and/or subtracting the constituent loop currents as indicated by the adopted sign convention and loop orientations.) Per Ampère's law, the excitation is the product of the current and the number of complete loops made and is measured in ampere-turns. Stated more generally: ...|$|E

In fact for a given strength the required <b>Ampere-turns</b> per pole are proportional to the cube of its distance from the centre. The low-carbon steel core was 396 mm long, the strength 28 T/m.

The selection of an appropriate {{reference standard}} is a crucial point in the performance evaluation of wire rope electromagnetic testing (EMT) instrument. In this paper, a 3 -D finite element model (FEM) has been developed to study three reference standards.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Measurements {{were made}} of the energy loss in a superconducting wire coil {{subjected}} to an axial magnetic field consisting of a ripple field superimposed on a steady field. The loss was measured calorimetrically using a sonic thermometer consisting of a resonance tube filled with helium gas in thermal contact with the superconducting wire under test. An adiabatic calorimeter and an almost isothermal calorimeter were constructed to measure the losses and their respective results were compared. The critical state theory of Kim, Hempstead and Strnad predicts the experimentally determined loss characteristics. The loss-vs-steady field characteristic was measured for Niobium, 25 wt percent Zirconium, 10 MIL wire. General agreement with Kim's theory was found with a maximum loss occurring at 254, 000 <b>ampere-turns</b> per meter, such loss falling to a lower and constant value at fields above 795, 000 <b>ampere-turns</b> per meter...|$|R

40|$|A {{current-carrying}} conductor {{is surrounded by}} a pair of ring cores. A sense winding on one core provides flux rate feedback to a power amplifier which drives the <b>ampere-turn</b> compensating current through a common compensating winding. The other core serves as a second- harmonic modulator to establish zero-flux operation and thus to ensure a perfect, temperature-independent current balance. A specially- developed burden resistor converts the compensating current into a voltage signal, which is amplified to give an 10 V output signal at the nominal value of the current to be measured. A substantial number of devices, ranging from 50 to 25000 Amperes is now operational in the beam transfer and extraction power supplies to the CERN SPS. (4 refs) ...|$|E

The active filter consists mainly of a two leg PWM voltage source inverter, which together with the auxiliary winding serves to supply leading reactive power to the machine. With sufficient <b>ampere-turn</b> capability of the auxiliary winding and an adequate control algorithm, the computer simulation results show {{that it is possible}} to obtain nearly unity power factor operation at the terminals of the main winding over a range of load conditions including rated load.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{treatment is}} described {{of the external}} stray field of C- shaped septum magnets, such as those designed for the beam extraction systems of the 400 GeV CERN Super Proton Synchrotron. A special conformal transformation of the magnetic plane yields analytic expressions for the four components of the stray field: the septum- shape field (due to {{the form of the}} septum conductor), the edge-effect field (due to the mechanical clearance between septum and yoke), the cooling-duct field (due to the presence of these ducts in the septum), and the magnetomotance field (caused by the <b>ampere-turn</b> losses in the yoke). These expressions can be computed by numerical iteration. The septum-shape field turns out to be opposite in sign to the other three, making possible a criterion which creates a minimal stray field for a given magnetic induction. Plots of calculated and measured stray fields are presented for four prototype septum magnets whose total induction is between 0. 38 and 1. 41 T. (3 refs) ...|$|E

A large magnet, {{in the form of}} a current loop, is assumed to be placed at the Space Station and another one on the spacecraft. The expression for the force between the two dipoles (loops) is obtained. Using a force of 15 Newtons (3. 4 pounds) in order to move the spacecraft, the number of <b>ampere-turn</b> needed in the current loops was calculated at various distances between them. The expression for the force of attraction between a current loop and a soft magnetic material was also examined and the number of amp-turn needed to provide a force of one-tenth of a pound at various distances is also calculated. This one tenth of a pound force would be used in a life line system for the retrieval of an adrift crewman or tool at the Space Station. The feasibility of using conventional antenna on the Station and the incoming vehicle for attraction or repulsion was also examined...|$|E

40|$|The {{continuous}} miniaturisation in {{the semiconductor}} industry increases the importance of accurate measurement and control of very small currents. In the field of precision electrical measurements, cryogenic current comparators (CCCs) are used as extremely sensitive and accurate instruments for scaling currents. In an international co-operation project, a special CCC system is being developed, optimised for the measurement of extremely small currents to less than 1 pA (10 − 12 A). DC {{superconducting quantum interference device}} (SQUID) readout is used for monitoring the <b>ampere-turn</b> unbalance of the CCC. In this paper, we report on the accurate determination of the CCC and SQUID input coil inductances. Matching of these inductances is required for obtaining ultimate current resolution with the CCC. We find very good agreement between measurements of the CCC inductance at room temperature and at 4. 2 K, and results from numerical calculations. The measured values for the input and mutual inductance of the SQUID sensor are in good agreement with the design values when the effect of the slit in the SQUID washer is correctly taken into account. Final current resolution of our measurement system is expected to be better than 1 × 10 − 15 A/√Hz for a CCC with 20, 000 primary windings...|$|E

The magnet in the ICAL detector {{will be used to}} distinguish the μ^- and μ^+ events induced by ν_μ and ν̅_̅μ̅, respectively. Due to the importance of the magnet in ICAL, an electromagnetic simulation has been carried out to study the B-field distribution in iron using various designs. The simulation shows better uniformity in the portion of the iron layer between the coils, which is bounded by regions which have lesser field strength as we move to the periphery of the iron layer. The ICAL magnet was configured to have a tiling structure that gave the minimum reluctance path while keeping a reasonably uniform field pattern. This translates into less <b>Ampere-turns</b> needed for generation of the required magnetic field. At low <b>Ampere-turns,</b> a larger fractional area with B > 1 Tesla (T) can be obtained by using a soft magnetic material.
