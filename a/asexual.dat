5|$|Scientists {{say that}} <b>asexual</b> {{reproduction}} {{in the wild}} is rare, and probably a last-ditch effort to reproduce when a mate is not present. <b>Asexual</b> reproduction diminishes genetic diversity, which helps build defenses against threats to the species.

5|$|For some, {{being a part}} of a {{community}} is an important resource because they often report having felt ostracized. Although online communities exist, affiliation with online communities vary. Some question the concept of online community, while others depend on the online <b>asexual</b> community heavily for support. Elizabeth Abbott posits that there has always been an <b>asexual</b> element in the population, but that <b>asexual</b> people kept a low profile. While the failure to consummate marriage was seen as an insult to the sacrament of marriage in medieval Europe, and has sometimes been used as grounds for divorce or to rule a marriage void, asexuality, unlike homosexuality, has never been illegal, and it has usually gone unnoticed. However, in the 21st century, the anonymity of online communication and general popularity of social networking online has facilitated the formation of {{a community}} built around a common <b>asexual</b> identity.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, AVEN members {{participated in}} the first <b>asexual</b> entry into an American pride parade when they walked in the San Francisco Pride Parade. In August 2010, {{after a period of}} debate over having an <b>asexual</b> flag and how to set up a system to create one, and {{contacting}} as many <b>asexual</b> communities as possible, a flag was announced as the <b>asexual</b> pride flag by one of the teams involved. The final flag had been a popular candidate and had previously seen use in online forums outside of AVEN. The final vote was held on a survey system outside of AVEN where the main flag creation efforts were organized. The flag colors have been used in artwork and referenced in articles about the sexuality.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, a 9-year-old female blacktip shark at the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center {{was found}} to be {{pregnant}} with a single near-term female pup, despite having never mated with a male. Genetic analysis confirmed that her offspring was the product of automictic parthenogenesis, a form of <b>asexual</b> reproduction in which an ovum merges with a polar body to form a zygote without fertilization. Along with an earlier case of parthenogenesis in the bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo), this event suggests that <b>asexual</b> reproduction may be more widespread in sharks than previously thought.|$|E
40|$|In diploid organisms, sexual {{reproduction}} rearranges allelic combinations between loci (recombination) {{as well as}} within loci (segregation). Several studies have analyzed the effect of segregation on the genetic load due to recurrent deleterious mutations, but considered infinite populations, thus neglecting the effects of genetic drift. Here, we use single-locus models to explore the combined effects of segregation, selection, and drift. We find that, for partly recessive deleterious alleles, segregation affects both the deterministic component {{of the change in}} allele frequencies and the stochastic component due to drift. As a result, we find that the mutation load may be far greater in <b>asexuals</b> than in sexuals in finite and/or subdivided populations. In finite populations, this effect arises primarily because, in the absence of segregation, heterozygotes may reach high frequencies due to drift, while homozygotes are still efficiently selected against; this is not possible with segregation, as matings between heterozygotes constantly produce new homozygotes. If deleterious alleles are partly, but not fully recessive, this causes an excess load in <b>asexuals</b> at intermediate population sizes. In subdivided populations without extinction, drift mostly occurs locally, which reduces the efficiency of selection in both sexuals and <b>asexuals,</b> but does not lead to global fixation. Yet, local drift is stronger in <b>asexuals</b> than in sexuals, leading to a higher mutation load in <b>asexuals.</b> In metapopulations with turnover, global drift becomes again important, leading to similar results as in finite, unstructured populations. Overall, the mutation load that arises through the absence of segregation in <b>asexuals</b> may greatly exceed previous predictions that ignored genetic drift...|$|R

500|$|The {{first study}} that gave {{empirical}} data about <b>asexuals</b> {{was published in}} 1983 by Paula Nurius, concerning the relationship between sexual orientation and mental health. 689 subjects—most of whom were students at various universities in the United States taking psychology or sociology classes—were given several surveys, including four clinical well-being scales. Results showed that <b>asexuals</b> {{were more likely to}} have low self-esteem and more likely to be depressed than members of other sexual orientations; 25.88% of heterosexuals, 26.54% bisexuals (called [...] "ambisexuals"), 29.88% of homosexuals, and 33.57% of <b>asexuals</b> were reported to have problems with self-esteem. A similar trend existed for depression. Nurius did not believe that firm conclusions can be drawn from this for a variety of reasons.|$|R

Yule et al. found that <b>asexual</b> male participants {{were more likely to report}} having a mood disorder than other males, particularly in comparison to the heterosexual participants. The same was found for female <b>asexual</b> participants over their heterosexual counterparts; however, non-asexual, non-heterosexual females had the highest rates. <b>Asexual</b> participants of both sexes were more likely to have anxiety disorders than heterosexual and non-heterosexual participants, as were they more likely than heterosexual participants to report having had recent suicidal feelings. Yule et al. hypothesised that some of these differences may be due to discrimination and other societal factors.|$|E

40|$|In sperm-dependent sexual/asexual mating systems, male mate {{choice is}} {{critical}} for understanding the mechanisms behind apparent stability observed in natural populations. The gynogenetic Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa) requires sperm from sexual males (e. g. Poecilia latipinna) to trigger embryogenesis, but inheritance is strictly maternal. Consequently, males should try to avoid or {{reduce the cost of}} mating with <b>asexuals.</b> We investigated male mate choice by documenting the presence of sperm in natural populations and found that a higher proportion of sexual females had sperm than <b>asexuals.</b> In addition, among those females that had sperm, sexuals had more sperm than <b>asexuals.</b> Our results hint at a role for male mate choice as a stabilizing factor in such systems...|$|R

5|$|The {{anamorphic}} form of P.semilanceata is an <b>asexual</b> {{stage in}} the fungus's life cycle involved {{in the development of}} mitotic diaspores (conidia). In culture, grown in a petri dish, the fungus forms a white to pale orange cottony or felt-like mat of mycelia. The conidia formed are straight to curved, measuring 2.0–8.0 by 1.1–2.0μm, and may contain one to several small intracellular droplets. Although little is known of the anamorphic stage of P.semilanceata beyond the confines of laboratory culture, in general, the morphology of the <b>asexual</b> structures may be used as classical characters in phylogenetic analyses to help understand the evolutionary relationships between related groups of fungi.|$|E

5|$|The parasite/host {{relationship}} probably {{drove the}} prevalence of sexual reproduction over the more efficient <b>asexual</b> reproduction. It seems that when a parasite infects a host, sexual reproduction affords {{a better chance of}} developing resistance (through variation in the next generation), giving sexual reproduction variability for fitness not seen in the <b>asexual</b> reproduction, which produces another generation of the organism susceptible to infection by the same parasite. Coevolution between host and parasite may accordingly be responsible for much of the genetic diversity seen in normal populations, including blood-plasma polymorphism, protein polymorphism, and histocompatibility systems.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{in higher}} animals, where {{parthenogenesis}} is rare, <b>asexual</b> reproduction may occur in plants by several different mechanisms. The formation of stem tubers in potato is one example. Particularly in arctic or alpine habitats, where opportunities for fertilisation of flowers by animals are rare, plantlets or bulbs, may develop instead of flowers, replacing sexual reproduction with <b>asexual</b> reproduction and {{giving rise to}} clonal populations genetically identical to the parent. This {{is one of several}} types of apomixis that occur in plants. Apomixis can also happen in a seed, producing a seed that contains an embryo genetically identical to the parent.|$|E
5|$|<b>Asexual</b> {{organizations}} and other Internet resources {{play a key}} role in informing people about asexuality. The lack of research makes it difficult for doctors to understand the causation. Like with any sexual orientation, most people who are <b>asexual</b> are self-identified. This can be a problem when asexuality is mistaken for an intimacy or relationship problem or for other symptoms that do not define asexuality. There is also a significant population that either does not understand or does not believe in asexuality, which adds to the importance of these organizations to inform the general population; however, due to the lack of scientific fact on the subject, what these groups promote as information is often questioned.|$|E
40|$|Most {{explanations}} for the evolutionary maintenance of sex depend {{on the assumption that}} sex produces variation by recombining parental haplotypes in the offspring. Therefore, meiosis is expected to be useful only in heterozygotes. We tested this assumption by competing sexual strains of yeast against constitutive <b>asexuals</b> in a hot (37 degrees C) culture for 500 generations, in either heterozygous or homozygous genetic backgrounds. We found that there was an initial cost of sex for all the sexual strains, which was indicated by a sharp increase in the proportion of <b>asexuals</b> after the induction of sex. The cost was larger in the heterozygotes than in the homozygotes, probably because of recombinational load. However, in two of the three heterozygote backgrounds, after the initial success of the <b>asexuals,</b> the remaining sexuals eventually drove them out of the population. These two heterozygotes also suffered the largest initial cost of sex. In the other heterozygote and in the three homozygote backgrounds it appeared {{to be a matter of}} chance whether sexuals or <b>asexuals</b> won. The average relative fitness increased in all the strains, but the increase was largest in the two strains that showed both the clearest advantage and the largest cost of sex. We conclude that these results are consistent with the traditional view that sex has a short-term cost but a long-term benefit. 7745...|$|R

40|$|A {{large scale}} survey of natural populations of Daphnia pulex was {{undertaken}} {{in the spring of}} 1985. Seventy seven populations were sampled from southwestern Ontario and central Michigan. Clones were also collected from Churchill, Manitoba. Clonal characteristics were determined by protein electrophoresis and restriction fragment pattern analysis of mitochondrial DNA. A large amount of genetic variability was revealed by both the electrophoretic and mitochondrial data sets. A total of 104 genetically distinct clones were discovered. Comparison of the two data sets revealed that the obligate <b>asexuals</b> must have arisen polyphyletically from cyclic parthenogenetic ancestors. Contagious spread of a dominant sex-limited meiosis suppressor is the most probable mechanism by which such a process could have occurred. Asexuality apparently arose in the north and is presently spreading southward at the expense of sexual populations. These results have important implications for the evaluation of the ecological and evolutionary potential of <b>asexuals.</b> The observed distribution of <b>asexuals</b> may reflect intrinsic genetic constraints rather than an optimization of breeding strategy by natural selection.
