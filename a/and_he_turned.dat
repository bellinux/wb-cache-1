5|$|About 10:00, Kamimura's gunnery officer erroneously {{informed}} him that Izumo had expended three-quarters of her ammunition <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> back after a five-minute rapid-fire barrage. He {{did not wish to}} leave the Tsushima Strait unguarded and thought that he could use his remaining ammunition on Rurik. By this time she had been sunk by Naniwa and Takachiho. They had radioed Kamimura that she was sunk, but he did not receive the message. Shortly after the Japanese turned back, Gromoboi and Rossia were forced to heave-to to make repairs. Iwate was the most seriously damaged Japanese ship and suffered a total of 40 killed and 37 wounded.|$|E

None of the Japanese ships were seriously damaged; despite Izumo receiving over 20 hits, she only suffered 3 men killed and 16 wounded during the battle. She began repairs at Sasebo Naval Arsenal in mid-September.|$|E
50|$|Sylvester is frantically {{summoning}} the elevator, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> {{looks down}} a corridor, and Tweety/Hyde is ambling along, laughing maniacally.|$|R
60|$|CHARTERIS (recoiling). Who {{told you}} that? (She {{shakes her head}} mysteriously, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> away from her moodily and adds) You had much better not have asked.|$|R
60|$|CRAVEN. Why, I didn't know {{it until}} to-night. It's a most {{extraordinary}} thing. We met by {{chance at the}} theatre; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> out to be my oldest friend.|$|R
5|$|At age fifty-eight, Baldwin {{desired to}} satisfy his nature {{of being a}} pioneer again by moving to Kansas, which {{was at that time}} a territory. He arrived as the brunt of the {{fighting}} in the territory was ending. Upon his arrival, he founded Baldwin City and built the first college building in the territory, which became the foundation for Baker University. He was in Kansas only for a short time when tragedy struck. On August 30, 1858, John's son Milton died unexpectedly after having been sick for only three days. Within a couple years, he laid out a town, built a grist mill and a saw mill, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> over the town and college to the Methodist Conference and returned to Berea, although he continued to finance it.|$|E
5|$|Charles trusted Isabeau {{enough by}} 1402 {{to allow her}} to {{arbitrate}} the growing dispute between the Orléanists and Burgundians, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> control of the treasury over to her. After Philip the Bold died in 1404 and his son John the Fearless became Duke of Burgundy, the new duke continued the political strife in an attempt {{to gain access to the}} royal treasury for Burgundian interests. Orléans and the royal dukes thought John was usurping power for his own interests and Isabeau, at that time, aligned herself with Orléans to protect the interests of the crown and her children. Furthermore, she distrusted John the Fearless who she thought overstepped himself in rank—he was cousin to the King whereas Orléans was Charles' brother.|$|E
5|$|He made {{a painful}} single in 25 minutes of batting {{before it became}} too much. The {{bruising}} severely restricted his mobility and breathing, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> down a single after being called through by Loxton, who had come in at the fall of Morris. Soon after, the pair took a single, and Barnes collapsed after completing the run. Barnes {{was taken from the}} ground with the assistance of Bradman among others, and sent back to hospital to recuperate for several days. He took no further part in the match, which ended in a rain-affected draw; Johnson again fell for single figures in the second innings. After the Test, Barnesstill injuredmissed the ten-wicket victory over Middlesex at Lord's. The match was Australia's only fixture between Tests.|$|E
25|$|In the Seongju Puli, {{the evil}} magician Sojinhang {{attempts}} {{to claim the}} earth goddess. However, Sojinhang is defeated, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> into a Jangseung, or totem pole. His daughters turn into the Seonangshin.|$|R
6000|$|His flesh quivers, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> with a start, as if fancying that [...] {{some one}} {{may be about to}} stab him in the back. Then he rises, [...] mounts, and rides on.|$|R
60|$|Oh, much. He'll be {{all right}} in a minute. [LADY KELSEY goes to the window, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> to MRS. CROWLEY.] You are a brick to come here to-day, when they're all in such awful trouble.|$|R
5|$|Hipper {{set sail}} on 15 December for another raid and {{successfully}} bombarded several English towns, but British destroyers escorting the 1st BCS had already encountered German destroyers of the High Seas Fleet {{in the early}} morning and fought an inconclusive action with them. Communications failures meant that Beatty was not notified of this encounter for several hours afterwards, but he turned in pursuit of the German ships once he learned of their presence. The lead British ships were closing in on the Germans when Beatty learned that Scarborough was being shelled later that morning <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> west to intercept the other German force.|$|E
5|$|In 1088, Robert's {{plans for}} the {{invasion}} of England began to falter, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> to Henry, proposing that his brother lend him some of his inheritance, which Henry refused. Henry and Robert then came to an alternative arrangement, in which Robert would make Henry the count of western Normandy, in exchange for £3,000. Henry's lands were a new countship based around a delegation of the ducal authority in the Cotentin, but it extended across the Avranchin, with control over the bishoprics of both. This also gave Henry influence over two major Norman leaders, Hugh d'Avranches and Richard de Redvers, and the abbey of Mont Saint-Michel, whose lands spread out further across the Duchy. Robert's invasion force failed to leave Normandy, leaving William Rufus secure in England.|$|E
5|$|Riegels did play, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> in {{a stellar}} second half performance, {{including}} blocking a Tech punt. In addition, Lom passed {{for a touchdown}} and kicked the extra point, {{but that was not}} enough. Tech would ultimately win the game and their second national championship 8–7. Georgia Tech's safety score after the wrong way run made the difference in the outcome of the game, which increased the significance of Roy's mistake. In spite of the loss, the example of how the distraught Riegels was persuaded to pick himself up, return to the field and play so hard during the second half is sometimes used by motivational speakers to illustrate overcoming setbacks.|$|E

60|$|Burton looked his {{surprise}} <b>and</b> discomfiture. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> upon the girl.|$|R
5|$|Also in {{the region}} was the British 74-gun ship of the line HMS Swiftsure under Captain Benjamin Hallowell, {{a veteran of the}} Battle of the Nile three years earlier. Swiftsure was passing slowly along the North African coast after being {{detached}} from Keith's fleet to join Warren's squadron off Malta, escorting a small convoy en route. Hallowell's ship was understrength as more than 80 men had been removed from the ship for service in Egyptian waters and illness rendered another 59 unfit for duty, while the vessel itself was in a poor state of repair and leaking badly. Progress had been slow, and a northeasterly wind had also significantly delayed Hallowell's passage. When he learned from a passing vessel that there was a French squadron {{in the region}}, he ordered the convoy to separate and sailed for Malta alone in an effort to join Warren more rapidly and warn him of Ganteaume's return. At 03:30 on 24 June his lookouts sighted sails to the southwest. Hallowell immediately assumed that the distant ships were the enemy <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> away from the French and tacked into the wind. By 05:30, lookouts on the nearest French ships, the ships of the line Jean Bart and Constitution had spotted the distant British vessel and were ordered to give chase.|$|E

50|$|When {{he gives}} his girlfriend Janet (Julie Bishop) her big break, she becomes an even bigger star. He feels like the joke's on him, when she starts going out with his friend George (Lorin Raker); <b>and,</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> to booze, for comfort.|$|R

25|$|A leg {{fracture}} curtailed Jarman's football career <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> to umpiring while {{concentrating on}} cricket. He made his first-class cricket debut on 16 December 1955 for South Australia against New South Wales at the Adelaide Oval, scoring 14 and nine and taking three catches.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{revolutions}} of 1848, {{one of his}} publications was {{suppressed by}} the government and he was forced into a brief exile in France. When he returned to Barcelona in 1849, the government curtailed his publishing activities, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> his attention to science and engineering instead.|$|E
25|$|One of the group's pilots, Cuban Juan Pablo Roque, {{a former}} major in the Cuban air force, {{unexpectedly}} left on February 23, 1996, {{the day before}} the two planes were shot down, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> up in Havana where he condemned the group. Roque had left Cuba four years earlier and was shortly after recruited by Brothers, where he flew several missions.|$|E

5000|$|The {{love affair}} between the vampire Angel and Buffy was fraught with metaphors. For example, their night of passion cost the vampire his soul.

6000|$|PATTY. I {{think she}} was feared you would offer to her out of pity. She said {{something}} to Miss Susan about keeping a flag flying. What she meant I know not. (But <b>he</b> knows, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> away his face.) Are you laughing, sir? ...|$|R
25|$|The first {{proposal}} for a tuberculosis facility was made in paper by George Bodington entitled An essay on the treatment and cure of pulmonary consumption, on principles natural, rational and successful in 1840. In this paper, he proposed a dietary, rest, and medical care program for a hospital he planned to found in Maney. Attacks from numerous medical experts, especially articles in The Lancet, disheartened Bodington <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> to plans for housing the insane.|$|E
25|$|Army {{life did}} not {{suppress}} Livens' creativity <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> {{his mind to}} the problem of making better weapons. On his own initiative, he fitted out makeshift laboratories at his Chatham barracks bedroom and in the officers' garage. For a firing range he used vacant land near one of the old forts which overlooked the Thames estuary. Here he worked on developing flame throwers and small mortars to throw oil and gas.|$|E
25|$|Clover became house {{surgeon to}} James Syme upon {{graduation}} in 1846. He became Resident Medical Officer at University College Hospital in 1848, and was admitted as a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1850. Originally Clover developed {{an interest in}} the field of urology. He practised as a surgeon, inventing two instruments for the crushing and removal of bladder stones. Ill health caused him to give up in 1853 <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> to general practice.|$|E
