40|$|Pearl millet is {{a staple}} food in Namibia. It is milled into flour by {{traditional}} and industrial dry milling processes. This {{research was conducted}} to help determine how to improve the nutritional value and acceptability of pearl millet. The traditional milling process involves a lactic acid fermentation step which lowers the pH of kernels. The effects of the traditional Namibian and industrial “dry milling” processes on the physical and nutritional composition of pearl millet grain were compared. Additionally, the effect of steeping three different Namibian pearl millet varieties (Kangara, Kantana and Okashana 2) in lactic acid and water on the colour and the phenolic content of the flour were determined. Regarding comparing the milling processes, variety Kangara was conditioned and decorticated traditionally with a pestle and mortar and industrially with an abrasive decorticator. The traditional decorticated grain was steeped and sun dried for 24 h before hammer milling, whereas the industrially decorticated grain was roller milled. Tristimulus colorimetry and proximate analyses were conducted on the samples. Concerning <b>acid</b> <b>steeping,</b> kernels were steeped in a pH 3. 5 solution and in water as a control. Colour, total polyphenol and c-glycosyl flavone contents were determined. The determination of cglycosylflavone content was particularly important because these compounds are considered goitrogenic. The traditionally milled flour was lighter in colour than industrial milled flour. However, it was significantly lower in protein, ash and c-glycosyl flavone contents in comparison to industrial milled flour. This {{was due to the}} removal of more pericarp and germ in the traditional process. The industrial dry milling process therefore produces flour with a higher nutrient content in terms of protein, fat and minerals. However, the traditional Namibian milling process makes the colour of the pearl millet flour lighter, which is probably the reason that it is more acceptable to consumers. Kernels steeped in a lactic acid solution were lighter in colour than those steeped in water. Irrespective of the steeping media, the total polyphenol content was significantly lower in steeped kernels compared to those unsteeped. A similar trend was observed for the cglycosyl flavone content. This indicates that some of these compounds may have leached out during steeping. For all varieties, kernels steeped in lactic acid had a significantly higher total polyphenol content than those in water, probably due to the dissociation of metal-polyphenol complexes in the acidic medium whereby these polyphenols became free and available for measurement. Thus, steeping in a lactic acid solution can lead to better colour improvement of kernels compared to steeping in water. Thus, lactic <b>acid</b> <b>steeping</b> can improve the sensory quality of pearl millet products. An industrial process can thus be designed to include tempering the grain with food grade lactic acid to produce sour taste and leach out the colour pigments, particularly the cglycosyl flavones hence lightening the colour of the industrial milled flour. This produces a product with high nutritional content, lighter in colour and has the sour taste that consumers find appealing. Copyright 2007, University of Pretoria. All rights reserved.

40|$|A {{process for}} the {{production}} of bakers' yeast in whey ultrafiltrate (WU) is described. Lactose in WU was converted to lactic acid and galactose by fermentation. Streptococcus thermophilus was selected for this purpose. Preculturing of S. thermophilus in skim milk considerably reduced its lag. Lactic fermentation in 2. 3 ×-concentrated WU was delayed compared with that in unconcentrated whey, and fermentation could not be completed within 60 h. The growth rate of bakers' yeast in fermented WU differed among strains. The rate of galactose utilization was similar for all strains, but differences in lactic acid utilization occurred. Optimal pH ranges for galactose and lactic acid utilization were 5. 5 to 6. 0 and 5. 0 to 5. 5, respectively. The addition of 4 g of corn steep liquor per liter to fermented WU increased cell yields. Two sources of nitrogen were available for growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae: amino <b>acids</b> (corn <b>steep</b> liquor) and ammonium (added during the lactic acid fermentation). Ammonium was mostly assimilated during growth on lactic acid. This process could permit the substitution of molasses by WU for the industrial production of bakers' yeast...|$|R
40|$|The escape of the {{blastocyst}} {{from the}} zona pellucida in vitro {{is probably the}} result of expan-sion due to fluid accumulation in the blastocoele. This fluid accumulation is mediated by the epithelial trophectoderm. Since prostagiandins of the E series {{are involved in the}} control of water movement across epithelia, the effect of prostaglandin antagonists on the hatching of mouse blastocysts has been examined. Protein-free culture media have been used to overcome the compli-cating effects of protein bindings of the drugs on their activities. 7 -Oxa- 1 3 -prostynoic acid, meclofen-amic acid, indomethacin and pheniodone inhibit hatching, but the properties of their dose-response lines vary. 7 -Oxa- 1 3 -prostynoic acid and meclofenamic <b>acid</b> have <b>steep</b> dose-response lines. The me-dian inhibitory doses (lD 5 Os) and confidence limits (P = 0. 05) are: 7 -oxa- 13 -prostynoic acid 0. 81 MM (0. 55 - 1. 20); meclofenamic acid 7. 72 MM (3. 43 - 17. 4). Indomethacin and phenidone have very flat dose-response lines indicating wide variability of response. The ID 5 Os and the confidence limits are: indomethacin 9. 08 M (1 - 67); phenidone 20 MM (92 - 263). Thus, 7 -oxa- 13 -prostynoic acid has much greater activity than the other three compounds.

In this work, features of lanthanide coordination chemistry and solute partitioning in TALSPEAK are examined to improve understanding of the fundamental chemistry that controls this process and to explain this anomaly. To accomplish this, a variety of spectroscopic techniques have been applied to the task. In addition, since the issue with TALSPEAK appears to lie in part {{in the definition of}} thermodynamic equilibria, complementary studies have been conducted elucidating fresh estimates of selected thermodynamic parameters of relevance to this system. To extend the utility of this investigation, some of these studies have examined the properties of substitute reagents within the general framework of TALSPEAK and TALSPEAK-like systems. In this report, observations from NMR, ESI-MS, and optical spectroscopic studies of lanthanide complexes are combined with thermodynamic modeling to provide fresh insights into lanthanide-actinide separations systems based on aqueous complexing agents...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{and absolute}} K+ affinities {{of a full}} series of aliphatic amino acids (Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile and alpha-amino-isobutyric acid (alpha-AiB)) and N-methylated aliphatic amino acids (N-Me-(Gly/Ala/alpha-AiB/Val/Leu)) were investigated theoretically by density functional theory calculations at the B 3 -LYP/ 6 - 311 +G(3 df, 2 p) //B 3 -LYP/ 6 - 31 G(d) level, and experimentally measured by the standard mass spectrometric kinetic method. Very good quantitative agreement {{was found between the}} theoretical and experimental results. The experimental K+ affinities were found to be consistent with the most stable charge-solvated CS 1 binding mode (bidentate form with K+ bonded between two carboxylic oxygens, O=C, -OH) for aliphatic amino acids, and the zwitterionic ZW 1 binding mode (bidentate form with K+ bonded between two carboxylate oxygens, COO-) for the N-methylated aliphatic amino <b>acids.</b> A <b>steeper</b> rising trend in ZW 1 stabilities (affinities) relative to that of CS 1 was found in the smaller aliphatic amino acids (Gly/Ala/alpha-AiB), but leveling off among the larger aliphatic amino acids (Val/Leu/Ile). This observed trend was rationalized in terms of greater deformation energy, E-def, found for the smaller Gly/Ala, and the leveling off of stabilizing ion-induced dipole (molecular polarizability) contributions from the non-interacting alkyl side chain in the larger aliphatic amino acids. The leveling off effect is aided by the relatively large size and soft, not so polarizing nature of the potassium cation. A good linear correlation (r(2) >= 0. 95) was found between the proton affinities (PA) and the ZW 1 /CS 1 K+ affinities, but because of the leveling off effect, the cross over or transition from CS 1 to ZW 1 K(+) binding mode was not found for isoleucine.

40|$|Anandamide, an {{endogenous}} eicosanoid derivative (arachidonoylethanolamide), binds to the cannabinoid receptor, {{a member}} of the G protein-coupled superfamily. It also inhibits both adenylate cyclase and N-type calcium channel opening. The enzymatic synthesis of anandamide in bovine brain tissue was examined by incubating brain membranes with [14 C]ethanolamine and arachidonic acid. Following incubation and extraction into toluene, a radioactive product was identified which had the same Rf value as authentic anandamide in several thin-layer chromatographic systems. When structurally similar fatty acid substrates were compared, arachidonic acid exhibited the lowest EC 50 and the highest activity for enzymatic formation of the corresponding ethanolamides. The concentration-response curve of arachidonic <b>acid</b> exhibited a <b>steep</b> slope, and at higher concentrations arachidonate inhibited enzymatic activity. When brain homogenates were separated into subcellular fractions by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, anandamide synthase activity was highest in fractions enriched in synaptic vesicles, myelin, and microsomal and synaptosomal membranes. When several areas of brain were examined, anandamide synthase activity was found to be highest in the hippocampus, followed by the thalamus, cortex, and striatum, and lowest in the cerebellum, pons, and medulla.

The bell-shaped curve of the pH-dependence of the catalytic constant for the AMP-activated enzyme showed pK values of 6. 1 and 7. 3, but the curve for the enzyme activated by 0. 9 M ammonium sulphate showed a drop of activity on the acid side at much higher pH values. Its bell was centred at pH 7. 8 but it was too narrow to be characterized by only two pK values. The narrowness of the curve could be explained by positive co-operativity, but not its unusually <b>steep</b> <b>acid</b> side. We suggest that the fall on the acid side is due to more than one hydronation (addition of H+). The points can be fitted by a curve with two de-activating hydronations and a de-activating dehydronation having identical titration pK values of 7. 5, and hence molecular values of 7. 0, 7. 5 and 8. 0. If both 0. 9 M ammonium sulphate and 5 mM AMP are added, the bell is as broad as with AMP alone, but is somewhat raised in pH optimum.

The color was changed to red purple in alkaline solution，shifting the absorption maximum to 505 nm. The color of the pigment was faded by exposure to a strong sunlight, with a faster rate in alkaline pH than in acid side. Although fading of the purple color occurred also by heating of the pigment in boiling water bath，it accompanied with a development of orange-brown color and a reinforcement of 495 nm absorption in acid pHs.

30|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is on recycling and reusing water and chemicals in the textile pre-treatment process without prior treatment. Before describing the research objective, the concepts of reusing and recycling are defined which are often misunderstood. The US Environmental Protection Agency (2004) have defined the two concepts aptly, reuse means utilisation of previously used wastewater for another process or purpose whereas recycle can be defined as reuse of same wastewater one or more times for the same process or purpose. The conventional three step pre-treatment process consists of desizing, scouring and bleaching. Desizing of a grey fabric removes previously added size or starchy material which can be done by using water (rot <b>steeping),</b> <b>acid,</b> enzyme, oxidation chemicals and alkali. Scouring uses alkali to remove oils, fats and waxes to improve the absorbency whereas bleaching uses oxidising agents to improve the whiteness of the fabric. In a conventional process, scouring and bleaching is done once which results in under utilisation of alkali and hydrogen peroxide. In the proposed process, wastewater from scouring and bleaching has been recycled three times for optimal utilisation of chemicals and water; the fabric properties were compared with the conventionally processed fabrics. After recycling the process water three times, the baths still contain alkali and oxidising agents. Hypothesis has been made to reuse the scouring and bleaching process water in the proportions of 50 : 50, 70 : 30 and 30 : 70 for desizing a grey fabric. Fabric properties were compared with conventional enzymatic desizing.|$|R
40|$|Barley is a {{valuable}} cereal with an old tradition in malt, food and feed. With new food applications this cereal can be rediscovered. Addition of a malting step in a food process can change the texture and taste of a product. It is also a process with high potential for improvement of nutrient availability. Extractable cell-wall polysaccharides {{have been linked to}} some positive health effects in humans. In cereals, these polysaccharides are mainly beta-glucan and arabinoxylan. The structure of extractable arabinoxylan and the content of bound ferulic acid dimers were studied in different cereals. For determination of amount and molecular weight of beta-glucan a high performance size-exclusion chromatography system (HPSEC) was set up with detection based on the specific binding of Calcofluor to β-glucan. This system was calibrated using a purified β-glucan fractionated into known narrow molecular weight ranges. A naked and a covered barley steeped and germinated at different temperatures and with different additions in the steeping water were studied. The total content and the average molecular weight of beta-glucan in the treated samples showed small changes after steeping at high temperature (48 °C), while steeping at lower temperature (15 °C) gave a significantly lower content. This was correlated with a strong increase of beta-glucanase activity over the time of germination. Addition of lactic <b>acid</b> to the <b>steeping</b> water at 48 °C decreased the beta-glucanase activity. Porridges made from two malts with a low phytate content and intact beta-glucan were introduced into a dynamic gastrointestinal model.

Ability of pH gradient generation was examined in three segments of rabbit collecting duct, cortical collecting duct (CCD), outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD) and inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD). These segments were perfused in vitro, and the steady–state luminal pH in stop–flow condition (pHs) and the electrochemical potential difference of H+ (EH) were determined using double-barreled liquid membrane pH microelectrode punctured into the lumen. In CCD, pHs was 7. 71 ± 0. 08 in normal rabbits, 7. 72 ± 0. 08 in DOCA-treated rabbits and 7. 27 ± 0. 05 in starved rabbits, while peritubular fluid was kept at pH 7. 5. EH (positive value means H+ accumulation in the lumen above electrochemical equilibrium) was - 15. 3 ± 5. 2, - 31. 3 ± 3. 7 and 10. 3 ± 3. 1 mV, respectively. Peritubular acidification (peritubular pH 6. 8) by reducing HC 03 -concentration decreased pHs, but increased its negativity of EH in all groups. In OMCD pHs was 6. 57 ± 0. 08 in normal, 6. 58 ± 0. 11 in DOCA-treated and 6. 47 ± 0. 12 in starved animals. EH was 54. 5 ± 4. 6, 57. 7 ± 6. 8 and 64. 2 ± 6. 9 mV, respectively. Peritubular acidification lowered pHs further, 5. 51 ± 0. 07, 5. 67 ± 0. 16 and 5. 41 ± 0. 19, respectively. EH was enhanced in all groups. In IMCD pHs was 7. 36 ± 0. 04 with EH being 6. 8 ± 2. 9 mV, and peritubular acidification did not generate pH gradient. These {{data suggest that}} the generation of a <b>steep</b> <b>acid</b> pH gradient is mainly due to OMCD. Luminal alkalinization predominated in CCD except in starved rabbits. IMCD did not generate appreciable pH gradient. The acid pH gradient in OMCD was enhanced by acute bath pH reduction, but not affected by chronic metabolic acidosis or mineralocorticoid pretreatment. Thus rabbit collecting ducts have distinct axial heterogeneity in the formation of pH gradient...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{addresses}} {{fundamental and}} practical considerations of using maize for production of recombinant proteins. Maize expressing the B subunit {{of the heat}} labile enterotoxin (LT-B) of Escherichia coli {{was used as a}} model crop. To address the fundamental aspects of the system, the role of LT-B and its native signal peptide (BSP) in plant cells was investigated using translational fusions with the green fluorescent protein. Confocal microscopy showed that fusions carrying BSP or a maize 27 kD γ-zein signal peptide (ZSP) accumulated in the secretory system of Arabidopsis and maize. Fusions lacking a signal peptide accumulated in the cytosol or nucleus. Understanding how plants process bacterial signal sequences can aid in developing effective strategies for producing recombinant proteins in plants. To address the practical aspects of the system, fractionation of transgenic LT-B maize by wet milling was performed using traditional (SO 2 +lactic <b>acid)</b> or water <b>steeping.</b> Functional LT-B was found at highest concentration in the fine fiber, lowest in germ and starch, and with highest total LT-B recovery from water steeping. Wet milling of LT-B maize with water steeping is suitable for enrichment of a high-value protein in fine fiber; co-utilization of germ and starch for traditional uses is feasible. A continuous in vitro endosperm callus culture (ENC) of Hi II maize was developed for functional analysis of seed-specific expressing genes. Morphological and biochemical characterization of ENC showed presence of aleurone and starchy endosperm cell types that resemble those of developing endosperms. ENC cells synthesize starch, zein storage proteins, and possess active starch metabolism enzymes. While the current ENC needs improvement for effective transient analysis of promoter/gene expression, it is useful for endosperm-targeted transgene analysis in stably-transformed lines of genotype Hi II. We expressed an endo- 1, 4 -β-glucanase from Ruminococcus albus in maize for potential use in bioethanol production. Molecular characterization showed successful transgene integration in recovered lines. In-depth biochemical analysis indicated that current standard assay systems need improvement for thoroughly characterizing recombinant endoglucanase.

40|$|A psychrotrophic bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens BM 07, {{which is}} able to {{accumulate}} polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (PHA) containing large amounts of 3 -hydroxy-cis- 5 -dodecenoate unit up to 35 mol% in the cell from unrelated substrates such as fructose, succinate, etc., was isolated from an activated sludge in a municipal wastewater treatment plant. When it was grown on heptanoic acid (C 7) to hexadecanoic acid (C 16) as the sole carbon source, the monomer compositional characteristics of the synthesized PHA {{were similar to those}} observed in other fluorescent pseudomonads belonging to rRNA homology group I. However, growth on stearic acid (C 18) led to no PHA accumulation, but instead free stearic acid was stored in the cell. The existence of the linkage between fatty acid de novo synthesis and PHA synthesis was confirmed by using inhibitors such as acrylic acid and two other compounds, 2 -bromooctanoic acid and 4 -pentenoic acid, which are known to inhibit β-oxidation enzymes in animal cells. Acrylic acid completely inhibited PHA synthesis at a concentration of 4 mM in 40 mM octanoate-grown cells, but no inhibition of PHA synthesis occurred in 70 mM fructose-grown cells in the presence of 1 to 5 mM acrylic acid. 2 -Bromooctanoic acid and 4 -pentenoic acid were found to much inhibit PHA synthesis much more strongly in fructose-grown cells than in octanoate-grown cells over concentrations ranging from 1 to 5 mM. However, 2 -bromooctanoic acid and 4 -pentenoic acid did not inhibit cell growth at all in the fructose media. Especially, with the cells grown on fructose, 2 -bromooctanoic <b>acid</b> exhibited a <b>steep</b> rise in the percent PHA synthesis inhibition over a small range of concentrations below 100 μM, a finding indicative of a very specific inhibition, whereas 4 -pentenoic acid showed a broad, featureless concentration dependence, suggesting a rather nonspecific inhibition. The apparent inhibition constant Ki (the concentration for 50 % inhibition of PHA synthesis) for 2 -bromooctanoic acid was determined to be 60 μM, assuming a single-site binding of the inhibitor at a specific inhibition site. Thus, it seems likely that a coenzyme A thioester derivative of 2 -bromooctanoic acid specifically inhibits an enzyme linking the two pathways, fatty acid de novo synthesis and PHA synthesis. We suggest that 2 -bromooctanoic acid can substitute for the far more expensive (2, 000 times) and cell-growth-inhibiting PHA synthesis inhibitor, cerulenin...|$|R
40|$|Barley is a {{good source}} of dietary fibre, {{particularly}} β-glucan and arabinoxylan, to increase formation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Butyric and propionic acid are involved in the preservation of colonic barrier function, thus decreasing the risk of inflammation. Previous studies have shown that malting barley increased formation of butyric acid in caecum of rats and had abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria than unmalted barley. However, this differed between malts, probably due to the differences in fibre functional characteristics. The aim of this work was to investigate the impact of barley variety and malting conditions on the functional properties of the dietary fibre in barley malt products, with the overall aim of improving intestinal health. Focus was given to β-glucan functional properties, but also arabinoxylan. The influence of these fibres on substrate delivery to the colon, SCFAs formation, microbiota composition and gene expression was investigated. In the first study, rats fed commercial barley malts had a higher level of butyric and propionic acids in the caecum and portal serum than those fed control diets (cellulose). β-glucan with broader molecular weight seemed to better increase the caecal SCFA formation. In addition, the malts contributed to improved mucosal barrier function and inflammatory state by decreasing mRNA expression of tight junction protein and toll-like receptors in the small intestine and distal colon. However, malt with high amounts of advanced glycation end-products seemed to attenuate the effect on occludin (tight junction protein) in the small intestine. To evaluate the possibility of using malting to tailor functional characteristics of the fibre, three barley varieties were malted using different temperatures and levels of lactic <b>acid</b> in the <b>steeping</b> water. The extent to which barley components changed depended on the variety. Steeping at 35 °C with 0. 4 % lactic acid preserved soluble fibre and β-glucan content better, but not the soluble arabinoxylan, compared with steeping at 15 °C and without lactic acid. However, no changes in β-glucan molecular weight (> 10 kDa) were observed. β-glucan molecular weight analysed with AF 4 at a wider molecular weight range (> 2 kDa), was shown to be affected by both variety and processing (steeping or mashing) to different extents. Addition of proteolytic enzymes shifted the β-glucan of high molecular weight to a lower molecular weight range, suggesting that proteins are involved in the structure of β-glucan, which might result in an apparently higher molecular weight. After passage through a dynamic gastrointestinal in vitro model (TIM- 1), it was observed that β-glucan molecular weight gradually decreased in the different barley products investigated. The longer in vitro transit time of soluble fibre and β-glucan was related to their high content and/or molecular weight, which also seemed to be linked to a higher degree of fermentation in an in vivo model (rats). In the last study it was investigated the differences of microbiota composition in rats fed barley malt products. Rats fed malt products had higher microbiota diversity (negatively associated with ulcerative colitis and obesity) than those fed barley extracts rich in arabinoxylan or β-glucan, and control. Malts contributing with a higher content of β-glucan increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and Blautia and tended to increase butyric acid, whereas soluble arabinoxylan increased Akkermansia and propionic acid in the caecum. By mixing barley products (brewers’ spent grain and malt) it was possible to modulate the microbiota into an intermediary abundance of taxa, with slight increase of butyric acid compared with malt alone. In conclusion, malting seems to be a potential processing method for tailoring barley composition to promote intestinal health. Both the selection of barley variety and the processing conditions affected the composition of malt products. The resulting barley products with a high content of soluble fibre, β-glucan and soluble arabinoxylan, enhanced colon fermentation, microbiota composition and, to some extent, the SCFA formation...|$|R
40|$|The Slavonianmountains have an {{important}} place in the floristic and vegetation picture of the continental part of Croatia. For the most part, the forest cover of this region consists of common beech stands (Fagus sylvatica L.). Many authors have worked on defining plant communities of common beech {{in the northern part}} of Croatia in the last ten years. Even though this has greatly contributed to get a better understanding of them,many questions have remained open. This is so because the research wasmostly conducted on smaller geographical scale where local conditions (specific microhabitat, anthropogenic influences, etc.) significantly affected the phytosociological analyses. On the other hand, it is rather difficult to carry out the analyses on a larger geographical scale because many regions and/or vegetative types are still scarcely covered by relevés. The goal of this study is to analyze the floral composition of beech forests of Psunj, Papuk and Krndija mountains, which have not been sufficiently studied so far. The next goal is to define and draw boundaries between plant communities, and also to analyze some of the ecological and phytogeographical features. During field studies of beech forests of Psunj, Papuk and Krndija mountains, 88 relevés were made using central European Braun-Blanquet methodology. The relevés have been compared with the relevés of similar vegetation in the wider geographical region (N Croatia, N Slovenia, S Hungary). The analysis included 1509 published relevés of 13 associations from Slovene Phytosociological Database (Šilc 2006) and Croatian database of forests vegetation (Krstonošić et al. 2007) – Lamio orvale-Fagetum, Cardamine savensi-Fagetum, Isopyro-Fagetum, Vicio oroboidi-Fagetum, Hacquetio-Fagetum, Helleboro odori-Fagetum, Carici pilosae-Fagetum, Festuco drymeiae-Fagetum, Galio odorati-Fagetum, Polysticho setiferi-Fagetum, Luzulo-Fagetum, Castaneo-Fagetum i Blechno-Fagetum. The numerical analysis of the floral composition was made (cluster analysis, NMDS), as well as the analysis of ecological variables (DCA). To describe ecological conditions, Ellenberg’s indicator values were also used. Clasification was made by cluster analyses in PC-ORD (McCune&Mefford 1999). NMDS was made by R using Vegan (Oksanen et al. 2006) and DCAwas made by CANOCO 4. 02 (Ter Braak and Šmilauer 2002). Slavonian hills are situated in the eastern part of Croatia, on the border of the Pannonian and Illyrian floristic area. The area is bordered by themountains of Papuk (953 ma. s. l.) and Krndija in the north-west and north, and by the mountains of Psunj (989 m a. s. l.), Požeška gora (616 m a. s. l.) and Dilj (471 m a. s. l.) in the south-east and east. The average annual air temperature in the researched area is around 11 °C, and it increases from the west to the east. January is the coldest month of the year, and July is the wormest. The average annual amount of precipitation decreases from the west to the east. The geological structure is quite diverse. Most of the mountain range is made of silicate and sandstone rock, while parts of Papuk and Požeška gora, and most parts of Dilj are made of limestone and marlstone. We have established three associations of beech forests that can be divided into acidophilic beech forests (Luzulo-Fagetum), submountainous beech forests (Festuco drymeiae-Fagetum luzuletosum and caricetosum pilosae) and mountainous beech forests (Cardamino savensi-Fagetum), (Fig. 2, 3, Tab. 1). Ass. Luzulo luzuloidi-Fagetum This association has already been reported in the study area. These stands are established on <b>acid</b> substrates on <b>steep</b> slopes (Fig. 4, 5). They have very poor floral composition. Furthermore, typical stands are dominated by Luzula luzuloides and this mainly occurs on the northern slopes; there are also stands dominated by Vaccinium myrtillus, which occurs in slightly warmer habitats (cf. Tab. 1 and 2). Ass. Festuco drymeiae-Fagetum In the study region of Psunj, Papuk and Krndija mountains, two groups of relevés could be distinguished, even though there is no sharp distinction between them (Fig. 2). A more acidophilic group (subass. luzuletosum), where Festuca drymeia is dominant with a significant presence of Luzula luzuloides, comes in great complexes at higher altitudes and ismore present in the western and northern part of themountains. In the southern and eastern part, it can be found in small patches. The domination of the Carex pilosa is significant for the other group (subass. caricetosum pilosae). It can be found at lower altitudes and it ismore present in the eastern and southern part of themountains. In the floristic sense, it differs from subass. luzuletosum with a greater participation of species such as Carpinus betulus, Quercus petraea, Tilia tomentosa and others. In the area of the association, in the ditches and basins, there is a significant presence of species such as Polystichum setiferum, Dryopteris filix-mas, Acer pseudoplatanus, Sambucus nigra, etc. (Tab. 1, 2, Fig. 3, 4). Having analyzed the submountainous beech forests in the region of Psunj, Papuk and Krndija mountains, the question remains whether there are two associations, or different subassociations within the same association. To solve the status and relationship with the related associations, it is necessary to make a study that will include all submountainous beech forests in a wider geographical area. The description and systematic position of this association is a topic of much debate in phytosociological literature. We are of the opinion that none of the nomenclature combinations are satisfactory. Ass. Cardamino savensi-Fagetum Beech stands grow in the upper region of Mt. Papuk (over 700 m a. s. l.) and they can be clearly distinguished from all other studied stands by their floral composition. By comparing it with the relevés of beech forests fromliterature, it has been undeniably established that this was the case of mountainous beech forests of the suballiance Lamio orvalae-Fagetum. By its floral composition and ecological characteristics, these forests are most similar to those described under the name Cardamino savensi-Fagetum in Slovenia. Slavonian mountains are a region of well-indented relief, where various base soils, soil depths, expositions, etc., occur in a very small space. Consequently, forest plant communities appear in a delicate mosaic of different vegetation types, which often alternate and whose boundaries are usually not clear-cut. The composition of beech forest flora of Psunj, Papuk and Krndija, as well as the whole area of Slavonian mountains is characterized by a smaller number of species compared to beech forests of the Dinarian region and western Croatia. For the most part, some Illyrian species (Lamium orvala, Calamintha grandiflora, Cardamine trifolia, Rhamnus fallax and Euphorbia carniolica) are missing or come up very rarely, which has also been noted in some earlier studies. Sizeable regions of beech forests of Slavonian mountains are still quite inadequately explored from a phytosociological point of view. This is mainly the case with the westernmost and north-easternmost regions (Fig. 1). In order to solve the remaining open questions and to better define plant communities, it is necessary to study these regions as well...|$|R

Najveći dio šumskoga pokrova toga područja čine sastojine obične bukve (Fagus sylvatica L.). Cilj je ovoga rada analizirati florni sastav bukovih šuma na Psunju, Papuku i Krndiji koji dosad nije dovoljno istražen, a nakon toga na temelju vlastitih i literaturnih snimaka definirati i razgraničiti biljne zajednice bukovih šuma, te na kraju analizirati neke od ekoloških i fitogeografskih obilježja koja određuju njihov pridolazak. Tijekom terenskih istraživanja napravljeno je 88 fitocenoloških snimaka prema standardnoj srednjoeuropskoj metodi. Napravljena je numerička usporedba sa snimcima bukovih šuma sa širega geografskoga područja, te su utvrđene ove biljne zajednice: Luzulo-Fagetum, Festuco drymeiae-Fagetum (luzuletosum i caricetosum pilosae) i Cardamino savensi-Fagetum. As. Cardamino savensi-Fagetum zabilježena je prvi put u Republici Hrvatskoj, i to u vršnom dijelu Papuka na karbonatnoj podlozi. Šumske biljne zajednice istraživanoga podru- čja dolaze u finom mozaiku različitih vegetacijskih tipova koji se često izmjenjuju i čije granice najčešće nisu oštre, što značajno utječe na njihov florni sastav i otežava njihovo razgranič avanje. Za rješavanje ostalih otvorenih pitanja i bolje definiranje biljnih zajednica potrebno je istražiti i druga područja slavonskoga gorja koja nisu obuhvaćena ovim istraživanjem. The Slavonianmountains have an {{important}} place in the floristic and vegetation picture of the continental part of Croatia. For the most part, the forest cover of this region consists of common beech stands (Fagus sylvatica L.). Many authors have worked on defining plant communities of common beech {{in the northern part}} of Croatia in the last ten years. Even though this has greatly contributed to get a better understanding of them,many questions have remained open. This is so because the research wasmostly conducted on smaller geographical scale where local conditions (specific microhabitat, anthropogenic influences, etc.) significantly affected the phytosociological analyses. On the other hand, it is rather difficult to carry out the analyses on a larger geographical scale because many regions and/or vegetative types are still scarcely covered by relevés. The goal of this study is to analyze the floral composition of beech forests of Psunj, Papuk and Krndija mountains, which have not been sufficiently studied so far. The next goal is to define and draw boundaries between plant communities, and also to analyze some of the ecological and phytogeographical features.
