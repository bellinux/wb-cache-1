5|$|At the 2000 Perl Conference, Jon Orwant made a {{case for}} a major new language-initiative. This led to <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> begin work on a {{redesign}} of the language, to be called Perl 6. Proposals for new language features were solicited from the Perl community at large, which submitted more than 300 RFCs.|$|E
5|$|Due to an {{accidental}} {{killing of a}} teenage girl while trying to shoot a psychotic suspect, the Tainan City Police Bureau made <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> develop {{a special kind of}} baton in 2006. When dealing with suspects without firearms, the police officers are expected to use the baton first in order to reduce accidents. To commemorate the girl who died, mayor Hsu named the baton after her.|$|E
5|$|Gravel was in {{the next}} several debates, in one case after CNN {{reversed}} <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> exclude him. Gravel, as with some of the other second-tier candidates, did not get as much time as the leaders; during the June 2, 2007, New Hampshire debate, which lasted two hours, he was asked 10 questions and allowed to speak for five minutes and 37 seconds.|$|E

The band's four-night run at London's Brixton Academy was the fastest selling in the venue's twenty-year history.|$|E
5|$|On 28 September, the Politburo of the Communist Party of China adopted <b>a</b> <b>{{decision}}</b> <b>to</b> expel {{him from}} the party.

5|$|Hamilton's {{portrait}} {{has been}} {{featured on the}} front of the U.S. $10 bill since 1928. The source of the engraving is John Trumbull's 1805 portrait of Hamilton, in the portrait collection of New York City Hall. In June 2015, the U.S. Treasury announced <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> replace the engraving of Hamilton with that of a woman. Before the bill was actually redesigned, the decision was changed due to the unanticipated popular success of the 2015 Broadway musical Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, the German night fighter intruders began {{achieving}} substantial successes. British ground defences, {{which had}} taken their toll on the German units in 1940, were now side-stepped by <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> shift the area of operations to the North Sea, by the English coast. In June German night fighter units claimed 22 RAF aircraft; 18 over the sea. In July 19 British aircraft were claimed for four losses. By October 1941 British loss records listed 54 aircraft of all types destroyed and a further 44 damaged in these operations to all causes. German losses amounted to 27 destroyed and 31 damaged to all causes.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, DoD {{officials}} {{met with}} the White House Military Office to discuss the program's future; the Pentagon had apparently wanted to terminate the VH-71 due to setbacks, budget issues, and design problems. The White House overruled <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> cancel; the program was effectively placed on hold while options were considered. In July 2008, the VH-71A (also called Increment 1) was to reach operating capability in 2010. The {{second phase of the}} development, VH-71B (Increment 2) was expected to start entering service in 2017.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Dunderdale {{was on an}} action {{committee}} that successfully lobbied Fishery Products International to reverse <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> shut down its Burin fish plant. The committee was successful and the plant remains in operation. She worked {{as a social worker}} with the provincial Department of Social Services, and accepted an offer to be part of an appeals board for inshore fishers after the cod moratorium.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, Snedden created {{a plan to}} let the paper's {{employees}} buy the company and keep ownership local. This plan was under way {{at the time of}} Snedden's death in 1989, but by 1992, many of the paper's employees were nearing retirement age. This factor, and the need for costly upgrades to expand the paper onto the Internet, led to <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> sell the News-Miner to Dean Singleton and Richard Scudder, co-founders of the MediaNews Group newspaper chain. In order to preserve the paper's independence—something desired by Snedden—the News-Miner was purchased by the family trusts of the two men, with ownership split 50/50 between the two trusts.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{losses were}} modest. The British {{assessed}} that two Japanese aircraft {{had been destroyed}} and another three damaged during attacks on airfields at Truk. Damage was also {{believed to have been}} inflicted on the airfields, floating dry dock, oil tanks, other harbour installations and ships that were attacked. Following the operation, Brind assessed that rockets had proven more useful than bombs, and was critical of the gunnery of all the cruisers other than Newfoundland. Members of the Japanese garrison told US Strategic Bombing Survey investigators after the war that the British raid had resulted in practically no damage. The most significant loss was the destruction of part of the garrison's records, which led to <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> bury the remaining files.|$|E

5|$|On 25 April 1999, {{more than}} ten {{thousand}} practitioners congregated outside Communist Party of China headquarters in Zhongnanhai to request legal recognition. That evening, then-Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin issued <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> eradicate Falun Gong. At Jiang's direction, on 7 June 1999 a special leading group was established within the party's Central Committee to manage the persecution. The resulting organisation, called the 6-10 Office, {{assumed the role of}} coordinating the anti-Falun Gong media coverage in the state-run press, as well influencing other party and state entities such as the courts and security agencies. On 19 July, the Central Committee of the Communist Party issued a document effectively banning the practice of Falun Gong. The following day, hundreds of practitioners were detained by security forces.|$|E
5|$|On 29 October 1918 the Croatian Parliament (Sabor) {{declared}} {{independence and}} decided to join the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, which in turn entered into union with the Kingdom of Serbia on 4 December 1918 to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. The Croatian Parliament never ratified <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> unite with Serbia and Montenegro. The 1921 constitution defining {{the country as a}} unitary state and abolition of Croatian Parliament and historical administrative divisions effectively ended Croatian autonomy.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the election, {{the party}} held a fundraiser which {{featured}} erotic art meant to illustrate political themes and a performance piece involving couples having sex behind a screen, erotic poetry, and body painting. After {{employees of the}} Liquor Control and Licensing Branch told Ince that the art installation would likely result in the refusal of a special event liquor licence, the party asked for judicial review. Both a provincial court and an appeal court refused the review because an actual application had not been submitted for <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> be reviewed, and the fundraiser went ahead with the serving of alcohol.|$|E

5|$|The Czech {{government}} had made <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> introduce a central registry for all misdemeanors in October 2014, planning {{to have the}} system working within two years. As police are obliged to revoke a gun license when the licensee has committed more than one misdemeanor against public order {{in a period of}} three years, the central registry of misdemeanors might have allowed police to effectively revoke the license long before the murders.|$|E
5|$|The F-111Cs {{gave the}} RAAF a {{powerful}} strike capability but were never used in combat. The aircraft went through modernisation {{programs in the}} 1980s and 1990s, and the RAAF acquired improved weapons to maintain their ability to penetrate hostile airspace. Despite this, by the 2000s the F-111Cs were becoming outdated and expensive to maintain, leading to <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> retire them in 2010 rather than 2020 as originally planned. The F-111s were replaced by 24 Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornets pending delivery of F-35 Lightning IIs in development.|$|E
5|$|The Wrights {{were glad}} {{to be free from}} the {{distraction}} of reporters. The absence of newsmen also reduced the chance of competitors learning their methods. After the Kitty Hawk powered flights, the Wrights made <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> begin withdrawing from the bicycle business so they could concentrate on creating and marketing a practical airplane. This was financially risky, since they were neither wealthy nor government-funded (unlike other experimenters such as Ader, Maxim, Langley and Alberto Santos-Dumont). The Wright brothers did not have the luxury of being able to give away their invention; it was to be their livelihood. Thus, their secrecy intensified, encouraged by advice from their patent attorney, Henry Toulmin, not to reveal details of their machine.|$|E
