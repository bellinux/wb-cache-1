Written in collaboration with Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Bennett, a series of education reform laws made a variety of major changes to statewide public schools. A statewide school voucher program was enacted. Children in homes with an income under $41,000 could receive vouchers equal to 90% {{of the cost of}} their public school tuition <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> money to attend a private school. It provides lesser benefits to households with income over $41,000. The program will be gradually phased in over a three-year period and would be available to all state residents by 2014.|$|E

In 2012, federal officials designated IU School of Medicine and the Rehabilitation Hospital of Indiana as a Traumatic Brain Injury Model System site, marking the partnership center as a national leader in TBI-related care and research. As only one of 16 such sites in the United States, the center received a five-year, $2 million grant to add researchers and physicians to the initiative of studying and treating traumatic brain injury {{and its impact on the}} lives of patients and their families. The center offers the highest level of comprehensive and multidisciplinary rehabilitation care and adds to national capacity for high-quality treatment and research for people with TBI. IU School of Medicine is also a leading member of the NCAA and U.S. Department of Defense CARE Consortium, a $30 million initiative to study concussions among student athletes <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> knowledge to improve safety and health of athletes, military service members and the general public. CARE Consortium research includes exploration post-concussive symptoms, performance and psychological health of student athletes and the analysis of data related to biomechanical, clinical, neuroimaging, neurobiological and genetic markers of injury. This work represents the largest and most comprehensive concussion study to date.|$|E

2500|$|Rabcewicz {{recommended}} a Mountain Line, but chose {{to build it}} to intersect with the Ofoten Line at Bjørnfjell, <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> line as a branch to reach Narvik, rather than build the line directly to the town. The Mountain Line could be built faster because of shorter tunnels, the longest being , which with an estimated [...] per day would give a construction time of 33 months.

However, Rabcewicz commented several disadvantages of the line, including steeper gradients, {{the lack of any}} fjords or residents between Kobbvatnet and Bjrnfjell and the increased amount of snow in the area. He estimated that the line could be completed by June 1945 given a work-force of 83,700 men.|$|E
2500|$|The Indian philosopher-sage Sri Aurobindo {{attempted}} {{to unite the}} Eastern and Western psychological traditions with his integral psychology, as have many philosophers and New religious movements.

Humans can approach the Divine intellectually, through learning and behaving according to the Divine Will as enclothed in the Torah, <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> deep logical understanding to elicit and guide emotional arousal during prayer. Christianity has tended to see the mind as distinct from the soul (Greek nous) and sometimes further distinguished from the spirit. Western esoteric traditions sometimes refer to a mental body that exists on a plane other than the physical. Hinduism's various philosophical schools have debated whether the human soul (Sanskrit atman) is distinct from, or identical to, Brahman, the divine reality. Taoism sees the human being as contiguous with natural forces, and the mind as not separate from the body. Confucianism sees the mind, like the body, as inherently perfectible.|$|E

Thus the audience pesters Noble to tell the ending of his unfinished stories, which are usually eventually concluded {{at the end of his}} shows. His most famous example is in his Randomist tour, where he started to tell a story about him being interviewed after Live 8 near the beginning of a show in Newcastle, which he did not finish until the end of the performance, around two hours later. This relates to an earlier comment he made in his Regent's Park show, saying that his mind [...] "Tends to wander off [...] slightly", and later added that [...] " [...] can open up too many tangents at once... it's a never-ending expanding spiral of possibilities." [...] At which point, he forgot what he was talking about.|$|E

He took it upon himself to create the jo deliberately longer than the average katana of the day, 128cm, as opposed to the sword's total length of approx. 100cm, <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>that</b> length to his advantage in a fight. Gonnosuke, drawing on his own considerable experience with the spear, longstaff, naginata and sword, devised a series of jo-techniques for use to counter and defeat a swordsman.
