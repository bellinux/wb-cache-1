5|$|The <b>aftercare</b> {{process for}} body {{piercing}} has evolved gradually through practice, and many myths and harmful recommendations persist. A reputable piercing studio should provide clients with written and verbal <b>aftercare</b> instructions, as {{is in some}} areas mandated by law.|$|E
5|$|Physical trauma {{including}} tearing, friction or bumping of {{the piercing}} site, which may cause edema and delay healing. The risks can be minimized by wearing properly sized jewellery and not changing it unnecessarily, by not touching the piercing more than required for <b>aftercare,</b> and by being conscious of environmental factors (such as clothing) that may impact the piercing.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary body {{piercing}} practices emphasize {{the use of}} safe {{body piercing}} materials, frequently utilizing specialized tools developed for the purpose. Body piercing is an invasive procedure with some risks, including allergic reaction, infection, excessive scarring and unanticipated physical injuries, but such precautions as sanitary piercing procedures and careful <b>aftercare</b> are emphasized to minimize the likelihood of encountering serious problems. The healing time required for a body piercing may vary widely according to placement, from {{as little as a}} month for some genital piercings to as much as two full years for the navel.|$|E
5|$|Following the season, the Rangers did not {{exercise}} their option, and traded Fleury's playing {{rights to the}} San Jose Sharks, which entitled the Sharks to a compensatory draft pick if Fleury signed elsewhere. He did so with a two-year, $8.5million contract with the Chicago Blackhawks. Two days prior {{to the opening of}} the 2002–03 season, he was suspended by the NHL for violating the terms of the league's substance abuse program. The Blackhawks hired one of Fleury's friends, also a recovering alcoholic, to ensure that he attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and abided by the terms of the NHL's <b>aftercare</b> program.|$|E
25|$|After being {{reinstated}} {{later in}} 1985, Muncie {{was traded to}} the Minnesota Vikings. He started and performed well in the final exhibition game, but he served a one-game suspension in the season opener after failing to attend two <b>aftercare</b> therapy sessions that were one of the conditions of his reinstatement. He retired three days later, citing his need to make his life his first priority and the difficulty with balancing drug rehabilitation with playing football.|$|E
25|$|On January 16, 2015, the RCMP {{released}} the MacNeil Review, an independent review that {{was conducted by}} former Assistant Commissioner Alphonse MacNeil. It included a total of 64 recommendations concerning supervision, training, technology and equipment, communications, and <b>aftercare.</b> The review revealed that there were complications in communication between officers during the shootings because multiple officers were sending radio transmission at once, and {{that none of the}} first responding officers were wearing their body armor. It has been publicly announced that the RCMP accepted and will implement all of the recommendations, and will also keep the public updated on their progress.|$|E
25|$|Offenders are {{generally}} required {{to submit a}} monthly supervision report within the first five days of the month to the U.S. Probation office. The report asks about employment; vehicles; finances (including bank accounts, past due debts, cash inflows and outflows, major expenditures, post office boxes, safe deposit boxes, and storage units); questionings by law enforcement; arrests; dispositions of charges; contacts with others who have criminal records; firearm possession and/or access; illegal drug use and/or possession; travel outside the probation district; special assessments, restitution, and fine balances and payments; community service obligations and hours completed, missed, and remaining; and drug, alcohol, and mental health <b>aftercare</b> and any sessions missed. It is a class D felony to make a false statement on this report.|$|E
25|$|Colic in horses {{is defined}} as {{abdominal}} pain, {{but it is a}} clinical sign rather than a diagnosis. The term colic can encompass all forms of gastrointestinal conditions which cause pain as well as other causes of abdominal pain not involving the gastrointestinal tract. The most common forms of colic are gastrointestinal in nature and are most often related to colonic disturbance. There are a variety of different causes of colic, some of which can prove fatal without surgical intervention. Colic surgery is usually an expensive procedure as it is major abdominal surgery, often with intensive <b>aftercare.</b> Among domesticated horses, colic {{is the leading cause of}} premature death. The incidence of colic in the general horse population has been estimated between 4 and 10 percent over the course of their lifetime. Clinical signs of colic generally require treatment by a veterinarian.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Kooman is {{an author}} and playwright. All of Kooman's {{writings}} focus on justice {{and many of the}} issues he writes about are gender-based. Kooman's first literary reaction to human trafficking was to write some short stories. Eventually, he also started writing the play that became She Has a Name in order to bring attention to the issue of human trafficking, specifically in its connections to sexual exploitation. In 2009, the script of She Has a Name was given the Scripts At Work/Alberta Playwrights Network Award. By February 2012, Kooman was working on a screenplay version of She Has a Name in order to expose it to a larger audience. Some Americans expressed an interest in staging She Has a Name in the United States. After starting to write this play, Kooman read about the Ranong human-trafficking incident in a Canadian newspaper and also heard about it through a friend of his who was working at an <b>aftercare</b> centre in Bangkok, Thailand to restore the dignity of former sex workers. Knowing that many of the impoverished girls who are smuggled in this manner become enslaved in brothels as child prostitutes, Kooman used the incident in the backstory of the play. There was a tour of She Has a Name in 2012, and the final performances were held in Red Deer. Kooman was glad to have the tour conclude in his hometown because the people of Central Alberta were very supportive of the play. During the tour, Kooman was awarded the Outstanding Alumnus Provincial Award Celebrating Excellence (PACE) by the Alberta Association of Colleges & Technical Institutes (AACTI) and the Alberta Ministry of Enterprise. In conjunction with this award, a $5000 scholarship was set up in Kooman's name, which he chose to have awarded to students who evince creativity, leadership, and a commitment to those who are in need. The PACE Award ceremony is biennial, and took place on June 13 in Edmonton at the AACTI Board of Governors Conference.|$|E

500|$|Big Brother 10 was {{produced}} by Brighter Pictures, a division of Endemol. This series of the programme had been confirmed since 2006 {{as part of a}} £180 million contract between Endemol and Channel 4. Phil Edgar-Jones was the creative director of the series whilst Sharon Powers was the executive producer. Open auditions for the programme, which were confirmed during the final of Celebrity Big Brother 6, began on 3 January 2009 in Edinburgh and ended on 7 February in Manchester. Internet auditioning via YouTube, which saw 2,600 apply, ended on 3 February 2009. Auditionees were subjected to three interviews with various producers, additional meetings with a psychologist and a psychiatrist and a final [...] "talk of doom", in which they were warned about the negative impact that appearing on Big Brother could have on their lives. In the weeks preceding the series, the selected housemates were put into [...] "hiding" [...] with no access to the outside world. Housemates were offered <b>aftercare</b> from the production team for up to six months after they left the programme.|$|E
500|$|Due to Secretariat's {{enduring}} popularity, Chenery {{remained a}} prominent figure in racing {{and a powerful}} advocate for Thoroughbred <b>aftercare</b> and veterinary research until her death in 2017. In 2004, the Maker's Mark Secretariat Center, dedicated to reschooling former racehorses and matching them to new homes, opened at the Kentucky Horse Park. In 2010, Chenery developed the Secretariat Vox Populi ("voice of the people") Award, which is voted for by racing fans. It is intended to acknowledge [...] "the horse whose popularity and racing excellence best resounded with the American public and gained recognition for Thoroughbred racing." [...] The consideration of the racing fan's engagement is what distinguishes the Vox Populi award from others. The first honoree in 2010 was Zenyatta, that year's Horse of the Year, while the second award went to Rapid Redux, a former claimer {{who went on to}} win 22 consecutive races at smaller racetracks. Paynter received the 2012 award for his battle with laminitis, the same condition that led to Secretariat's death. [...] "Paynter's popularity stems from his ability to battle and exceed expectations, making him the perfect choice as the recipient of this year's Vox Populi Award", said Chenery. [...] "After seeing firsthand the devastating effects of this disease, I am even more convinced that the industry must continue to diligently fight laminitis. The progress we have made to date clearly benefited Paynter — a beautiful colt with a tremendous spirit." ...|$|E

50|$|Effectiveness {{studies have}} shown that inmates who {{participate}} in residential treatment programs while incarcerated have 9 to 18 percent lower recidivism rates and 15 to 35 percent lower drug relapse rates than their counterparts who receive no treatment in prison. Furthermore, inmates who receive <b>aftercare</b> (treatment after imprisonment) have an even greater chance of not recidivating. When combined with treatment that was given during incarceration <b>aftercare</b> can be a very useful tool in recidivism reduction. Some offenders have had a reduced risk of recidivism of up to eighty percent after undergoing <b>aftercare</b> treatment.|$|E
