5|$|Beginning in 1969, {{during the}} Vietnam War, the {{university}} {{did not allow}} the U.S. military to have Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) programs on campus, though Columbia students could participate in ROTC programs at other local colleges and universities. At a forum at the university during the 2008 presidential election campaign, both John McCain <b>and</b> <b>Barack</b> <b>Obama</b> said that the university should consider reinstating ROTC on campus. After the debate, the President of the University, Lee C. Bollinger, stated {{that he did not}} favor reinstating Columbia's ROTC program, because of the military's anti-gay policies. In November 2008, Columbia's undergraduate student body held a referendum {{on the question of whether}} or not to invite ROTC back to campus, and the students who voted were almost evenly divided on the issue. ROTC lost the vote (which would not have been binding on the administration, and did not include graduate students, faculty, or alumni) by a fraction of a percentage point.|$|E
