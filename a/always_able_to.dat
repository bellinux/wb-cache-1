Despite not having had any formal {{instruction}} himself, he taught dance, including to such later stars as Gregory Hines and Ben Vereen. He also taught footwork to boxing greats Sugar Ray Robinson and Muhammad Ali. Less glamorously, he ran a café, and even worked as a carpenter and a mechanic.

5|$|Goldfaden was {{churning}} out a repertoire – new songs, new plays, and translations of plays from Romanian, French, and other languages (in {{the first two}} years, he wrote 22 plays, and would eventually write about 40) – {{and while he was}} not <b>always</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> retain the players in his company once they became stars in their own right, he continued for many years to recruit first-rate talent, and his company became a de facto training ground for Yiddish theater. By the end of the year, others were writing Yiddish plays as well, such as Moses Horowitz with Der tiranisher bankir (The Tyrannical Banker), or Grodner with Curve un ganev (Prostitute and Thief), and Yiddish theater had become big theater, with elaborate sets, duelling choruses, and extras to fill out crowd scenes.|$|E

25|$|The NTWF {{had some}} success as an {{organisational}} tool and {{as a symbol of}} trade union unity, but since its member unions retained full control over their own affairs it was not <b>always</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> have a direct influence on trade disputes. In 1912, it called a National Dock Strike in support of London dockers which was observed only in a few centres, and which ended within a week. This was regarded as an embarrassing setback, and led the Federation to adopt a more cautious approach in subsequent years. In 1921 it was criticised for failing to bring out its members in support of the miners in the Black Friday crisis.|$|E

According to the principle of assistance and the accomplishment of the administrative police tasks, the need implied by these functions are satisfied. The administrative police ensures the continuation among the units of ministries with its description in the second place. However, policing the traffic and security of the transportation roads represent according to the ruling texts, one of its fundamental functions. The Royal Gendarmerie gives priority to the preventive measures by accompanying the activities of the Government. This is the reason why it reinforces the administrative police with its all in hand a unit which is securing and discouraging as much widely and continuously as possible.|$|E

25|$|Miyazaki {{has stated}} in {{interviews}} that he frequently worked close to publication deadlines {{and that he}} was not <b>always</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> finish his monthly instalments for serialization in Animage. On such occasions he sometimes created apologetic cartoons. These were printed in the magazine, instead of story panels, to explain to his readers why there were fewer pages that month or why the story was absent entirely. Miyazaki has indicated that he continued making improvements to the story prior to the publication of the tankōbon volumes, in which chapters from the magazine were collected in book form. Changes made throughout the story, before the release of each tankōbon volume, range from subtle additions of shading to the insertion of entirely new pages. Miyazaki also redrew panels and sometimes the artwork was changed on whole pages. He made alterations to the text and changed the order in which panels appeared. The story as re-printed in the tankōbon spans 7 volumes for a combined total of 1060 pages.|$|E
25|$|The program {{sometimes}} {{does not}} start until after 7:00p.m. Eastern, {{due largely to}} CBS' live broadcast of NFL games. At the conclusion of an NFL game, 60 Minutes will air in its entirety. However, on the West Coast (and all of the Mountain Time Zone), because the actual end of the live games is much earlier in the afternoon {{in comparison to the}} Eastern and Central time zones, 60 Minutes is <b>always</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> start at its normal start time of 7:00p.m. Pacific Time, leaving affiliates free to broadcast local news, the CBS Evening News, and other local or syndicated programming leading up to 60 Minutes. The program's success has also led CBS Sports to schedule events (such as the final round of the Masters Tournament and the second round and regional final games of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament) leading into 60 Minutes {{and the rest of the}} network's primetime lineup, thus (again, except on the West Coast) pre-empting the Sunday editions of the CBS Evening News and affiliates' local newscasts.|$|E
25|$|The Luftwaffes poor {{intelligence}} {{meant that}} their aircraft were not <b>always</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> locate their targets, and thus attacks on factories and airfields {{failed to achieve}} the desired results. British fighter aircraft production continued at a rate surpassing Germany's by 2 to 1. The British produced 10,000 aircraft in 1940, in comparison to Germany's 8,000. The replacement of pilots and aircrew was more difficult. Both the RAF and Luftwaffe struggled to replace manpower losses, though the Germans had larger reserves of trained aircrew. The circumstances affected the Germans more than the British. Operating over home territory, British aircrew could fly again if they survived being shot down. German crews, even if they survived, faced capture. Moreover, bombers had four to five crewmen on board, representing a greater loss of manpower. On 7 September, the Germans shifted away from {{the destruction of the}} RAF's supporting structures. German intelligence suggested Fighter Command was weakening, and an attack on London would force it into a final battle of annihilation while compelling the British Government to surrender.|$|E

25|$|Serbian {{policy had}} a {{distinct}} anti-Bulgarian flavor, attempting {{to prevent the}} Bulgarian influencing the inhabitants of Macedonia. On the other hand, Bulgaria was using the power of its religious institutions (Bulgarian Exarchate established in 1870) to promote its language and make more people identify with Bulgaria. Greece, in addition, was in an advantageous position for protecting its interests through the influence of Patriarchate of Constantinople which traditionally sponsored Greek-language and Greek-culture schools also in villages with few Greeks. This put the Patriarchate in dispute with the Exarchate, which established schools with Bulgarian education. Indeed, belonging to one or another institution could define a person's national identity. Simply, if a person supported the Patriarchate they were regarded as Greek, whereas if they supported the Exarchate they were regarded as Bulgarian. Locally, however, villagers were not <b>always</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> express freely their association with {{one or the other}} institution as there were numerous armed groups trying to defend and/or expand the territory of each. Some were locally recruited and self-organized while others were sent and armed by the protecting states.|$|E
25|$|The most {{dramatic}} and influential changes Marius {{made to the}} Roman army were named the Marian Reforms. In 107 BC, shortly after being elected as Consul, Marius, fearing barbarian invasion, saw the dire need {{for an increase in}} troop numbers. Until this time, the standard requirements to become a Roman soldier were very strict. To be considered a soldier {{in the service of the}} republic, an individual was required to provide his own arms and uniform for combat. Marius relaxed the recruitment policies by removing the necessity to own land, and allowed all Roman citizens entry, regardless of social class. The benefits to the army were numerous, with the unemployed masses enlisting for military service alongside the more fortunate citizens. Poorer citizens were drawn to lifelong service, as they were rewarded with the prospect of settlement in conquered land. This also 'Romanized' the population in newly subjugated provinces, thus reducing unrest and lowering the chance of revolt against the Roman Republic. The new Roman army, its numbers vastly bolstered by lower class citizens whose future was tied to their permanent career, was <b>always</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> provide reserves in times of disaster. In addition, the growth of the army ensured continued military success due to the high number of recruits available for each campaign. Even though the army increased in size considerably, Marius also sought to improve organization among his troops.|$|E
