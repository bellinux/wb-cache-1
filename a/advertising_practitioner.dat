Agencies perform commercial relationships, bringing them into being and constantly redefining them. Attending to these multiple modes of mediation opens up questions about {{the status of}} advertising, the role of cultural intermediaries, and the relationship between production and consumption, economy and culture...|$|R

40|$|From 1920 to 1954 British <b>advertising</b> <b>practitioners</b> spoke readily about {{achieving}} professional status. Studies {{have examined}} sociological processes of professionalization within the advertising industry. This thesis instead addresses {{the question of}} what professionalism meant in the context of advertising, a modern occupation whose practitioners claimed expertise in persuasion itself. The meaning of professionalism in advertising matters because the formation of professional identity was fundamental to the way that advertising agents understood, marketed, and sought to develop their practice in the years following the First World War. This is important because their practice – the creation of marketing campaigns based on advertisements – was significant in shaping and supporting the economic growth of twentieth-century consumer culture in Britain. The thesis has three main dimensions. First, it examines the advertising industry’s changing professional narrative by considering how practitioners described their occupation, {{and the ways in which}} professionalism was experienced and enacted on an everyday basis in the advertising agency. Second, taking the development of advertising institutions and education programmes, it explores the means by which young people and women presented themselves as practitioners. Third it demonstrates the effect of connections with the global advertising industry and imperial markets on the formation of a professional identity in British advertising from 1920 to 1954. Understanding the formation of professional identity of <b>advertising</b> <b>practitioners</b> in particular offers insight into the nature of professional identity in an emerging creative occupation. Moreover, it forms an important part in explaining how <b>advertising</b> <b>practitioners</b> helped <b>advertising</b> not only to be tolerated, but to grow in to be a central and ‘normal’ feature of British consumer society. ...|$|R

40|$|Advertising, as an industry, {{reflects}} contemporary values whilst {{creating new}} symbols and changing both behaviour and public opinion. In {{the last hundred}} years, advertising has pervaded most areas of life, and spaces that are commer-cial free are becoming rare. The aim of this dissertation is to explore and map various social objects that create the perception of morality that exists within an advertising agency. The approach {{can be described as}} qualitative, descriptive, analytical and constructionist. The study belongs within a research field that borders on business economics/business ethics and philosophy/descriptive eth-ics. Fundamental to my study is the exploration of stories told by different key <b>advertising</b> <b>practitioners.</b> Using a symbolic interactionist approach I iden-tify important meaning carriers that together create and identify the social object “morality”. The empirical material is based on a total of 36 inter-views conducted 1998 - 2000 with <b>advertising</b> <b>practitioners</b> from 15 Swedish advertising agencies. In addition to the interviews, an observational study was conducted for eight months in 1998 along with a literature study. In my analysis two related areas for morality emerged; one area focusing mo-rality related to clients/consumers, and one area focusing morality within the agency/branch. Two models illustrating the results were constructed. Ethics, economics and aesthetics often find themselves on opposing sides in various situations and at different levels in the work process at the agency. The need for profit gives precedence to the economic aspect mak-ing it superior to the other two aspects, ethics and aesthetics. However, <b>advertising</b> <b>practitioners</b> that prioritise the aesthetic aspects may find them-selves be awarded a golden egg at some yearly gala. Hence, to stretch a little on morality and sin with refinement may be quite rewarding. The dissertation was preceded by and builds on a licentiate dissertation in busi-ness economics by Larsson-Eklund (2002) - “Med skaparkraft som etiskt argu-ment.

40|$|Advertising and {{integrated}} marketing communication degree enrollments in the Middle East {{are projected to}} grow throughout the 2010 ’s with undergraduate numbers rising by over 7 % and numerous graduate programs being established in the Gulf Cooperative Council (GCC) and {{other countries in the}} region (Husseini, 2009; UNESCO, 2010). Although harmonizing the objectives of advertising educators with those of <b>advertising</b> <b>practitioners</b> continues to be of great importance, few studies have addressed the educational requirements for successful careers in advertising and none have focused on the Persian Gulf/north Africa region. A survey of 302 top advertising executives by Fill (2007) found education had a significant effect on income, the extrinsic measure of success employed in the study. Majoring in advertising was found to be the strongest educational predictor of income. However, a study of 113 advertising agency recruiters suggested advertising education to be of more modest value (Low, 2000). While 62. 3 % of advertising agencies that recruit do so from among advertising majors. Respondents also mentioned recruiting from 16 other majors and rated business as a more valuable major than advertising or mass communication.
