40|$|It is {{well known}} that the angular {{alignment}} tolerance for Brewsters <b>angle</b> <b>plates</b> is not generally strict. It is often not appreciated that for high index plates however wedge tolerances are small. It is shown that in Brewster <b>angle</b> <b>plates</b> of high refractive index materials, small wedge angles in the fabricated plate can cause internal s-plane reflections to become trapped by total internal reflection. A wedge angle acceptable in terms of its p-plane loss can cause such trapped reflections. In laser systems the resulting multiply reflected beams can move sideways in the plate and eventually hit o-ring seals or other mounting arrangements, causing component damage and leaks in unexpected locations. Stray light problems of an unexpected nature can occur from this effect in both laser based and conventional optical devices...|$|R
50|$|By using MCNP to {{simulate}} the cave and surrounding room, {{it was determined that}} 2.5 cm of polyethylene lining would be added to the inside and outside of the cave to help thermalize the neutrons. In addition, another 60-cm thick wall will be built of concrete blocks around the entirety of the cave. This presented a structural risk on the roof. An <b>angle</b> <b>plate</b> was used to help support this load. The floor was also lined with 5 cm of polyethylene to reduce scatter from the floor. This reduced the average dose {{on the surface of the}} cave below 10 mRem/hr. “Hotspots” still existed at the points closest to the source, but they were less than 50 mRem/hr, well within the 100 mRem/hr regulation.|$|E
40|$|An <b>angle</b> <b>plate</b> is a multistructure {{consisting}} of two plate-like substructures meeting at a right angle. We regard it as obtained from a single plate by a thought process of folding such as to affect the material behavior only in the “elbow” region. We model the three-dimensional plate-like material region corresponding to the plate to fold as being transversely isotropic with respect to an axis orthogonal to its base surface, with admissible displacements in the Reissner-Mindlin’s form. After folding, we require that in the “elbow” region the material be doubly transversely isotropic and the displacement be the common restriction of the admissible displacements in the two “arm” plates. Under these assumptions, from a three-dimensional virtual-work formulation of equilibrium we deduce by mere thickness integration the field, boundary, and transmission equations of our twodimensional model of a linearly elastic <b>angle</b> <b>plate.</b> Various generalizations of this model are possible, some of which we occasionally indicate...|$|E

30|$|The {{reciprocating}} ledges help {{in ensuring}} contact {{even when a}} slight error of a few degrees is made. Also, the dynamic hip screw allows controlled collapse allowing earlier union. This is important in case there is a slight translation due to a few degrees of discrepancy between {{the angle of the}} osteotomy and the barrel plate. The resultant medialization is helped by the controlled collapse. The fixed double <b>angle</b> <b>plate</b> often causes nonunion in comparison [11].|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The shear {{strength}} parameter of cobalt-rich crusts {{can be used}} to design cobalt-rich crusts mining head. The shearing test of cobalt-rich crusts sample was done with different angle shearing testing apparatus. Firstly, the cobalt-rich crusts sample with the size of 50 mmx 50 mmx 50 mm cube was clamped in the variable <b>angle</b> <b>plate.</b> Secondly, the sample ware loaded till to be damaged. Lastly,the damaged load were recorded at the degree of 50, 60 and 70 to establish their shearing strength and normal stress empirical formula. According to the testing result, its cohesion and internal friction angle parameters are respectively 0. 275 MPa and 54. 43 degree. Restricted by the number of samples and limited by laboratory testing,in-situ shearing strength test should be carried out to improve the proposed empirical formula...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The <b>angled</b> blade <b>plate</b> {{has been}} the {{historical}} standard in fixed-angle extramedullary subtrochanteric femur fracture fixation, but it requires an extensile lateral approach to the femur. Little formal evaluation exists for specifically designed percutaneous extramedullary implants. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare 3 locked plating constructs, all with percutaneous insertion capability, with the standard 95 -degree <b>angled</b> blade <b>plate</b> to determine whether specifically designed fixed-angle extramedullary implants for subtrochanteric femur fractures were biomechanically comparable to the <b>angled</b> blade <b>plate.</b> Methods: Forty composite adult femurs were divided into 4 equal groups. The constructs evaluated included a 95 -degree <b>angled</b> blade <b>plate,</b> a broad 4. 5 -mm combination locking plate, and a precontoured proximal femoral locking plate (PFLP) with and without an oblique, angled strut or ‘‘kickstand’’screw. A 30 -degree wedge osteotomy was used to create a subtrochanteric fracture gap model. Each specimen underwent axial and torsional stiffness testing along with cyclic axial loading to failure. Results: Axial stiffness testing revealed that the PFLP with the ‘‘kickstand’’ screw was the stiffest construct (92. 2 ± 17. 4 Nm/m), which was 211...|$|R
40|$|A new {{procedure}} {{has been}} developed to minimise {{the influence of the}} sample imperfections on the identified material parameters by eliminating from the objective function those modes that are mostly affected by the model errors so that eventually no modifications of the numerical model are required. The model errors in the present study are defined as deviations of a test sample from the assumptions made in the numerical model, namely, assumptions about lamination <b>angle,</b> <b>plate</b> flatness and uniform thickness. To improve an accuracy of the error functional coming from the physical tests, an influence of measurement errors on the modal parameters has been investigated additionally. The proposed practical solution makes the results of inverse problems more accurate and reliable and the identification process more effective. This new methodology has been successfully applied for the non-destructive material properties characterisation of carbon/epoxy prepreg (SEAL® Texipreg HS 160 RM) panels...|$|E
30|$|We {{performed}} a prospective study including all {{patients who were}} treated for unstable distal radius fracture with a volar fixed <b>angle</b> <b>plate</b> DiPHOS-RM produced by Lima Corporate (Villanova di San Daniele Del Friuli, Udine, Italy), {{during a period of}} 7  months (between March 2012 and September 2012). We included all the consecutive fractures of AO types B and C that remained displaced after an initial attempt at reduction. Fractures of AO type A were not included since they were treated nonsurgically. The patients were 16 men and 24 women with an average age of 65  years at the time of injury (range 26 – 82). The mechanisms of injury were simple falls on outstretched hands in 22 cases, motor vehicle accidents in 7 cases and sports injuries in another 11 cases. The fractures were classified according to the AO classification: 21 fractures were type C 1, 9 were type C 2, 2 were type C 3, 2 were type B 1 and 6 were type B 2.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} lattice Boltzmann {{study of a}} droplet {{dynamics}} on solid surface. For this purpose, a lattice Boltzmann model by Shan and Chen (SC) was used in modeling two-dimensional (2 D) multicomponent multiphase (MCMP) of droplet dynamics. The miscible/immiscible region is determined for couples of initial densities and cohesion strengths through droplet tests. The chosen densities were then test with Laplace and good correlation was achieved. Then, the dynamic behavior of the droplet is investigated through {{the study of the}} surface adhesion strength between fluid-solid surfaces. The results were compared with the analytical solutions and good agreements were achieved. Gravitational effect was successfully included for simulating droplet dynamics on solid surface by incorporating Bond number. The simulation was extended by studying the displacement of droplets on solid surface due to variations of contact <b>angle,</b> <b>plate</b> inclination and Bond number.
