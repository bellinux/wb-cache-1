500|$|Moon {{suffered}} {{a number of}} setbacks during the 1970s, most notably the accidental death of chauffeur Neil Boland and the breakdown of his marriage. He became addicted to alcohol, particularly brandy and champagne, and acquired a reputation for decadence and dark humour; his nickname was [...] "Moon the Loon." [...] After moving to Los Angeles with personal assistant Peter [...] "Dougal" [...] Butler during the mid-1970s, Moon recorded his only solo album, the poorly received Two Sides of the Moon. While touring with the Who, on several occasions he passed out on stage and was hospitalised. By their final tour with him in 1976, and particularly during production of The Kids Are Alright and Who <b>Are</b> <b>You,</b> <b>the</b> drummer's deterioration was evident. Moon moved back to London in 1978, dying in September of that year from an overdose of Heminevrin, a drug intended to treat or prevent symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.|$|E

2500|$|On Rosh Hashanah, {{the night}} Kiddush {{is similar to}} that of the other festivals. Where it differs, it is usually to follow the pattern of middle blessing of the Amidah. (An example is the {{concluding}} formula [...] "Blessed <b>are</b> <b>You,</b> <b>the</b> LORD, King over the entire world, Who sanctifies [...] Israel, and the Day of Remembrance.") During the day, the verses Psalms 81:4-5 are recited prior to the blessing over wine. Many also say the festival verses (usually first), and on Shabbat all recite the relevant verses (see above) at the very beginning.|$|E
2500|$|Now {{without a}} {{centerpiece}} {{for the upcoming}} season's programming, Silverman had Ruby, Spears, and the Hanna-Barbera staff revise the treatments and presentation materials to tone down the show and better reflect its comedy elements. The rock band element was dropped, and more attention was focused upon Shaggy and Too Much. According to Ruby and Spears, Silverman was inspired by Frank Sinatra's scat [...] "doo-be-doo-be-doo" [...] {{at the end of}} his recording of [...] "Strangers in the Night" [...] on a flight to one of the development meetings, and decided to rename the dog [...] "Scooby-Doo" [...] and re-rechristen the show Scooby-Doo, Where <b>Are</b> <b>You!</b> <b>The</b> revised show was re-presented to CBS executives, who approved it for production.|$|E

2500|$|Conflicting {{testimony}} against Jesus {{was brought}} forth by many witnesses, to which Jesus answered nothing. Finally {{the high priest}} adjured Jesus to respond under solemn oath, saying [...] "I adjure you, by the Living God, to tell us, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> Anointed One, the Son of God?" [...] Jesus testified ambiguously, [...] "You have said it, and in time {{you will see the}} Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty, coming on the clouds of Heaven." [...] The high priest condemned Jesus for blasphemy, and the Sanhedrin concurred with a sentence of death (...) [...] Peter, waiting in the courtyard, also denied Jesus three times to bystanders while the interrogations were proceeding just as Jesus had predicted.|$|E
2500|$|Is and Always Was was {{released}} on October 6, 2009, on Eternal Yip Eye Music. In 2009, {{it was announced that}} Matt Groening had chosen Johnston to perform at the edition of the All Tomorrow's Parties festival that he curated in May 2010, in Minehead, England. Later that year, he was invited by rock band Cage the Elephant to appear at Starry Nights Fest, a music festival in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Johnston performed a brief solo set before being joined on stage by Cage, who backed performances of several songs, including [...] "Speeding Motorcycle" [...] and [...] "True Love Will Find You in the End". Also that year, Dr. Fun Fun and Smashing Studios developed an iPhone platform game called Hi, How <b>Are</b> <b>You.</b> <b>The</b> game is similar to Frogger, but features Johnston's art and music. It is said Daniel Johnston played it during its development and liked it, although he was not familiar with the iPhone.|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{the labor}} {{workforce}} of PDM Contractors consisted {{of high school students}} and young men. One of these youths was a 15-year-old named Anthony Antonucci, whom Gacy had hired in May 1975. In July 1975, Gacy arrived at the youth's home while the youth was alone, having injured his foot at work the day prior. Gacy plied the youth with alcohol, wrestled him to the floor and cuffed Antonucci's hands behind his back. The cuff upon Antonucci's right wrist was loose: Antonucci freed his arm from the handcuff after Gacy left the room. When Gacy returned, Antonucci—a member of his high school wrestling team—pounced upon him. The youth wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key and cuffed Gacy's hands behind his back. Gacy screamed threats, then calmed down and promised to leave if Antonucci removed the handcuffs. The youth agreed and Gacy left the house. Antonucci later recalled that Gacy had told him as he lay on the floor: [...] "Not only <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> only one who got out of the cuffs; you got them on me." ...|$|E
