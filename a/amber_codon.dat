50|$|In 2007 {{the group}} of Jason W. Chin {{presented}} an orthogonal ribosome, which was optimized for <b>Amber</b> <b>codon</b> suppression. The 16S rRNA was mutated {{in such a way}} that it bound the release factor RF1 less strongly than the natural ribosome does. This ribosome did not eliminate the problem of lowered cell fitness caused by suppressed stop codons in natural proteins. However through the improved specificity it raised the yields of correctly synthesized target protein significantly (from ~20% to >60% percent for one <b>amber</b> <b>codon</b> to be suppressed and form <1% to >20% for two amber codons).|$|E

50|$|The {{orthologous}} set of synthetase and tRNA can be mutated and screened through {{directed evolution}} {{to charge the}} tRNA with a different, even novel, amino acid. Mutations to the plasmid containing the pair can be introduced by error-prone PCR or through degenerate primers for the synthetase's active site.Selection involves multiple rounds of a two-step process, where the plasmid is transferred into cells expressing chloramphenicol acetyl transferase with a premature <b>amber</b> <b>codon.</b> In the presence of toxic chloramphenicol and the non-natural amino acid, the surviving cells will have overridden the <b>amber</b> <b>codon</b> using the orthogonal tRNA aminoacylated with either the standard amino acids or the non-natural one. To remove the former, the plasmid is inserted into cells with a barnase gene (toxic) with a premature <b>amber</b> <b>codon</b> but without the non-natural amino acid, removing all the orthogonal synthases that do not specifically recognize the non-natural amino acid.In addition to the recoding of the tRNA to a different codon, they can be mutated to recognize a four-base codon, allowing additional free coding options.The non-natural amino acid, as a result, introduces diverse physicochemical and biological properties {{in order to be}} used as a tool to explore protein structure and function or to create novel or enhanced protein for practical purposes.|$|E
40|$|The {{frequencies}} of 2 -aminopurine- and 5 -bromouracil-induced A:T → G:C transitions were compared at nonsense sites throughout the rII region of bacteriophage T 4. These frequencies are influenced both by adjacent base pairs within the nonsense codons and by extracodonic factors. Following 2 AP treatment, they {{are high in}} amber (UAG) and lower in opal (UGA) codons than in allelic ochre (UAA) codons. In general, 5 BU-induced transitions are more frequent in both <b>amber</b> and opal <b>codons</b> than in the allelic ochre codons. 2 AP- and 5 BU-induced transition frequencies {{in the first and}} third positions of opal codons are correlated with those in the corresponding positions of the allelic ochre codons. Similarly, the {{frequencies of}} 2 AP-induced transition in the first and second positions of <b>amber</b> <b>codons</b> and their ochre alleles are correlated. However, there is little correlation between the frequencies of 5 BU-induced transitions in the first and second positions of allelic <b>amber</b> and ochre <b>codons...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The tRNA(CUA) can {{be charged}} with lysine in vitro by the concerted action of the M. barkeri Class I and Class II Lysyl-tRNA synthetases, which do not {{recognize}} pyrrolysine. Charging a tRNA(CUA) with lysine was originally hypothesized {{to be the first}} step in translating UAG <b>amber</b> <b>codons</b> as pyrrolysine, a mechanism analogous to that used for selenocysteine. More recent data favor direct charging of pyrrolysine on to the tRNA(CUA) by the protein product of the pylS gene, leading to the suggestion that the LysRS1:LysRS2 complex may participate in a parallel pathway designed to ensure that proteins containing the UAG codon can be fully translated using lysine as a substitute amino acid in the event of pyrrolysine deficiency. [...] Further study found that the genes encoding LysRS1 and LysRS2 are not required for normal growth on methanol and methylamines with normal methyltransferase levels, and they cannot replace pylS in a recombinant system for UAG <b>amber</b> stop <b>codon</b> suppression.|$|R
40|$|Asp- 51 and Asp- 120 of the Escherichia coli {{melibiose}} carrier on plasmid pKKMB were separately {{replaced by}} <b>amber</b> <b>codons</b> and transformed into eight amber suppressor strains, producing eight amino acid substitutions for each site.

Revertants to Glu- 51 and Glu- 120 show less activity than the wild type. The Asp- 51 position is more crucial for Na(+) -stimulated melibiose accumulation than is the Asp- 120 site...|$|R
50|$|The {{possibility}} of reassigning codons was realized by Normanly et al. in 1990, when a viable mutant strain of E. coli {{read through the}} UAG ("amber") stop codon.This was possible thanks to the rarity of this codon {{and the fact that}} release factor 1 alone makes the <b>amber</b> <b>codon</b> terminate translation. Later, in the Schultz lab, the tRNATyr/tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) from Methanococcus jannaschii, an archaebacterium, was used to introduce a tyrosine instead of STOP, the default value of the <b>amber</b> <b>codon.</b> This was possible because {{of the differences between the}} endogenous bacterial synthases and the orthologous archaeal synthase, which do not recognize each other. Subsequently, the group evolved the orthologonal tRNA/synthase pair to utilise the non-standard amino acid O-methyltyrosine. This was followed by the larger naphthylalanine and the photocrosslinking benzoylphenylalanine, which proved the potential utility of the system.|$|E
50|$|Similarly to {{orthogonal}} tRNAs and aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), orthogonal ribosomes {{have been}} engineered {{to work in}} parallel to the natural ribosomes. Orthogonal ribosomes ideally use different mRNA transcripts than their natural counterparts and ultimately should draw on a separate pool of tRNA as well. This should alleviate some {{of the loss of}} fitness which currently still arises from techniques such as <b>Amber</b> <b>codon</b> suppression. Additionally, orthogonal ribosomes can be mutated and optimized for particular tasks, like the recognition of quadruplet codons. Such an optimization is not possible, or highly disadvantageous for natural ribosomes.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>amber</b> <b>codon,</b> rare sense codons have also been considered for use. The AGG codon codes for arginine, but a strain has been successfully modified to make it code for 6-N-allyloxycarbonyl-lysine.Another candidate is the AUA codon, which is unusual in that its respective tRNA has to differentiate against AUG that codes for methionine (primordially, isoleucine, hence its location). In order to do this, the AUA tRNA has a special base, lysidine. The deletion of the synthase (tilS) was possible thanks to {{the replacement of the}} native tRNA with that of Mycoplasma mobile (no lysidine). The reduced fitness is a first step towards pressuring the strain to loose all instances of AUA, allowing it to be used for genetic code expansion.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSelenocysteine and pyrrolysine, {{known as}} the 21 st and 22 nd amino acids, are {{directly}} inserted into growing polypeptides during translation. Selenocysteine is synthesized via a tRNA-dependent pathway and decodes UGA (opal) codons. The incorporation of selenocysteine requires the concerted action of specific RNA and protein elements. In contrast, pyrrolysine is ligated directly to tRNAPyl and inserted into proteins in response to UAG (<b>amber)</b> <b>codons</b> {{without the need for}} complex re-coding machinery.

Revertants that do produce heavy chain are generated {{at a high}} rate, which is termed hypermutation. By DNA sequencing of subclones, we have confirmed that whenever mu chain is produced by the usually silent allele, a true reversion {{is found in the}} DNA.

It {{is difficult to imagine}} that one day organisms might exist that use an entirely different code to translate the information of their genome. Recent developments in the field of synthetic biology, however, have opened the gate to their creation. The genetic code of several organisms has been expanded by the heterologous expression of evolved aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNACUA pairs that mediate the incorporation of unnatural amino acids in response to <b>amber</b> <b>codons.</b> These UAAs introduce exciting new features into proteins, such as spectroscopic probes, UV-inducible crosslinkers, and functional groups for bioorthogonal conjugations or posttranslational modifications. Orthogonal ribosomes provide a parallel translational machinery in Escherichia coli that has lost its evolutionary constraints. Evolved variants of these ribosomes translate <b>amber</b> or quadruplet <b>codons</b> with massively enhanced efficiency.

5000|$|The <b>amber</b> <b>codon</b> is {{the least}} used codon in Escherichia coli, but {{hijacking}} it results in a substantial loss of fitness. One study in fact {{found that there were}} at least 83 peptides majorly affected by the readthrough Additionally, the labelling was incomplete. As a consequence, several strains have been made to reduce the fitness cost, including the removal of all amber codons from the genome.In most E. coli K-12 strains (viz. Escherichia coli (molecular biology) for strain pedigrees) there are 314 UAG stop codons. Consequently, a gargantuan amount of work has gone into the replacement of these. One approach pioneered by the group of Prof. George Church from Harvard, was dubbed MAGE in CAGE: this relied on a multiplex transformation and subsequent strain recombination to remove all UAG codons—the latter part presented a halting point in a first paper, but was overcome. This resulted in the E. coli strain C321.ΔA, which lacks all UAG codons and RF1. This allowed an experiment to be done with this strain to make it [...] "addicted" [...] to the amino acid biphenylalanine by evolving several key enzymes to require it structurally, therefore putting its expanded genetic code under positive selection.|$|E

Non-randomness was found both {{upstream and downstream}} from the stop codon, suggesting that these sequences may help in ensuring efficient termination of translation. The UAG <b>amber</b> <b>codon</b> is the least-used stop codon and the bias in the nucleotide distribution 5 ' and 3 ' to the stop codon was more pronounced for the <b>amber</b> <b>codon</b> than for the other stop codons.

To determine which of the ORFs actually code for proteins involved in transposition, we have introduced <b>amber</b> <b>codons</b> into each ORF by site-directed mutagenesis which make neutral changes in the overlapping ORFs. Each mutant IS 1 was then tested for its ability to mediate cointegrate formation in Su(+) and Su(-) backgrounds.

40|$|In {{some type}} C retroviruses, {{translation}} of the pol gene appears to require translational suppression of the proximal gag <b>amber</b> <b>codon.</b> To identify {{the region of the}} viral nucleic acid responsible for synthesis of the pol gene products, a 300 -base-pair DNA fragment containing the stop codon from a type C murine virus (AK virus) was inserted into the Escherichia coli lacZ gene such that the translational reading frame was maintained. Introduction of the resulting fusion gene into cells resulted in the suppression of the viral stop codon. As measured by beta-galactosidase production, suppression occurred at a frequency of approximately 10 %. Suppression could occur in at least several vertebrate cell types and was not augmented by virus replication or the expression of viral gene products. This indicates that gag <b>amber</b> <b>codon</b> suppression does not require augmented levels of suppressor tRNA species...|$|E

40|$|Phage display {{technology}} {{allows for the}} rapid isolation and characterization of monoclonal antibodies that have vast potential for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. However, the panning process, which utilizes a host strain that suppresses termination by the <b>amber</b> <b>codon,</b> has an inherent bias toward clones containing randomly generated amber stop codons, complicating identification of positive binding antibodies when the antibody genes are finally expressed in a nonsupressor host. Here, we perform biopanning against a Histone 2 A peptide using streptavidin- or anti-biotin-coated beads. After four rounds, a dominant clone is characterized but contains a spurious amber stop codon. A protocol is given that readily corrects the <b>amber</b> <b>codon,</b> allowing for soluble antibody production once the phagemid {{is transformed into a}} nonsuppressor bacterial strain.

40|$|While the Escherichia coli Su- 3 (tyrT) {{tyrosine}} tRNA suppressor inserts only tyrosine at <b>amber</b> <b>codons</b> in E. coli, we {{show here}} that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae this tRNA inserts leucine and no {{significant amounts of}} any other amino acid. Thus, the E. coli tyrosine tRNA is functionally a leucine tRNA in yeast cytoplasm. This functional identity may correlate with a structural relationship between the E. coli tyrosine and yeast leucine tRNAs, which are both members of the uncommon type II class of tRNA structures. The results raise the possibility that in evolution a tRNA may be {{more closely related to}} a tRNA of different acceptor specificity, but of the same type class, than to one with the same amino acid specificity, but of a different type class...|$|R

Toward this goal, a general approach with potential for isolating aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that incorporate unnatural amino acids with high fidelity into proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is described. The method {{is based on}} activation of GAL 4 -responsive HIS 3, URA 3, or lacZ reporter genes by suppression of <b>amber</b> <b>codons</b> in GAL 4. The optimization of GAL 4 reporters is described, and {{the positive and negative}} selection of active Escherichia coli tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (EcTyrRS) /tRNACUA is demonstrated. Importantly, both selections can be performed on a single cell and with a range of stringencies. This method will facilitate the isolation of a range of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) /tRNACUA activities from large libraries of mutant synthetases...|$|R
40|$|The “cloverleaf” base-pairing {{pattern was}} {{established}} as the structural paradigm of active tRNA species some 30 years ago. Nevertheless, this pattern does not accommodate the folding of certain mitochondrial tRNAs. For these recalcitrant tRNAs, we have proposed structures having from 5 to 10 base pairs in the anticodon stem {{rather than the}} canonical 6. The absence {{of these types of}} tRNAs in cytoplasmic translation systems, however, raises the possibility that they may not be bona fide alternate folding patterns for active tRNA molecules. For this reason, we have designed new tRNA genes based on our model of unusual mitochondrial tRNAs, having 7, 8, 9, and 10 base pairs in the anticodon stem with other modifications to the D-stem and connector regions. We show here that these synthetic genes produce tRNAs that actively suppress <b>amber</b> <b>codons</b> in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Three {{classes of}} nonidentical streptomycin-resistant {{mutations}} were distinguished in Escherichia coli by {{their effect on}} the efficiency of suppression by an amber suppressor gene, sup E. The first class of mutation caused a strong restriction in efficiency of suppression of an <b>amber</b> <b>codon</b> in various cistrons of phage λ and in an alkaline phosphatase structural gene of E. coli. The second class caused weak restriction, and the third class caused no restriction. The restrictive effect of the streptomycin resistance mutation of the first class on the sup E gene was reduced by addition of streptomycin. This mutation {{had little effect on}} efficiencies of suppression by amber suppressor genes sup D and sup F. Analyses on the alkaline phosphatase formed in the suppressor strain indicated that mutation to restrictive streptomycin resistance causes a reduction in translation of the <b>amber</b> <b>codon</b> in the alkaline phosphatase structural gene...|$|E
40|$|The SUP-RLl {{suppressor}} in {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae causes lethality in haploid strains {{but not in}} diploid or aneuploid strains that are heterozygous for the suppressor locus.

40|$|Ribosome {{releasing}} factor (RR factor) releases ribosomes from mRNA at {{the termination}} codon in Escherichia coli. In {{the absence of}} this factor, polypeptides with molecular weights {{very close to the}} molecular weight of bacteriophage R 17 coat protein were synthesized in vitro under the direction of a mutant R 17 phage RNA having an amber mutation at codon 7 of the coat cistron. The major coat-protein-like product shared all the R 17 coat protein sequence except that the seven NH 2 -terminal amino acids were missing. The minor product had the complete coat protein sequence starting from formylmethionine except for a probable amino acid substitution at codon 7 (UAG). Addition of RR factor inhibited the synthesis of the major protein. These results indicate that, in the absence of RR factor, the ribosome that has released the NH 2 -terminal hexapeptide at the <b>amber</b> <b>codon</b> stays on the mRNA and subsequently reinitiates translation "in phase" immediately after the <b>amber</b> <b>codon</b> without formylmethionine...|$|E

In contrast the same T 7 amber bacteriophages multiplied well in these strains when supplemented with polyamines. The requirement for polyamines for optimal translation of <b>amber</b> <b>codons</b> in vivo was confirmed by showing that infection of polyamine-depleted E. coli with bacteriophage T 7 carrying an amber mutation in gene 1 resulted in an increased accumulation of the amber fragment of the gene 1 protein and a decreased accumulation of the full-length gene 1 protein compared with infection of an amine-supplemented culture.

40|$|Specialized transducing phages (λ and ϕ 80) {{have been}} used as vectors in the {{transfer}} of genes (wild type and mutant) from the bacterium Escherichia coli to haploid cell lines of the plants Lycopersicon esculentum and Arabidopsis thaliana. The overall phenomenon of transfer, gene maintenance, transcription, translation, and function has been termed transgenosis. Transgenosis of galactose and lactose operon genes was detected by survival and growth of the plant cells on defined medium with galactose and lactose as sole sources of bulk carbon. Phages carrying a defective operon, unrelated bacterial genes, or no bacterial genes, do not affect the normal result of death on these media, nor do they prevent growth on optimal growth media. Transgenosis of the E. coli gene z (lac operon) was confirmed by a biochemical-immunological test specific for E. coli β-galactosidase. Plant cells were unable to effectively suppress an E. coli nonsense mutation. The E. coli mutant suppressor gene, supF+, specifies insertion of tyrosine at <b>amber</b> (UAG) nonsense <b>codons.</b> Introduction of supF+ results in a lethal transgenosis on medium normally optimal for plant cell growth.

40|$|The {{specificity}} {{and efficiency}} of base-mispair editing by the 3 ' [...] 5 ' exonuclease activity of phage T 4 DNA polymerase has been measured using a sensitive infectivity assay.

These primers, when hybridized to phi X 174 single-stranded DNAs containing an <b>amber</b> <b>codon,</b> result in a mispaired nucleotide at the 3 '-hydroxyl end of the primer chain within the <b>amber</b> <b>codon.</b> DNA synthesis on these primer X templates without {{the removal of the}} mispaired terminal nucleotide results in the formation of heteroduplex molecules that yield viable revertants upon transfection into an amber nonsuppressor host. This method permits determination of the efficiency of editing of a mismatch to 1 in 10 (6) mismatches that escape editing and allows all eight mispairs that can yield viable revertants at an <b>amber</b> <b>codon</b> to be studied. The results of experiments with primers hybridizing to phi X 174 am 16 and am 3 codons show that the order of mispair editing by T 4 DNA polymerase is Ttemplate X Gprimer less than (A X G, T X C) less than (T X T, G X A, G X G, A X C) less than A X A. The efficiency of editing depends upon the mispair, as well as the neighboring DNA sequence. Under these conditions of synthesis, the 3 ' [...] 5 ' exonuclease activity, depending upon the mispair and DNA sequences beyond the nearest neighbors, is estimated to contribute a factor of from 2. 3 X 10 (3) - to greater than 10 (6) -fold to the accuracy of T 4 DNA polymerase...|$|E

Second site reversion was detected in the D-stem, thereby demonstrating the efficacy of the search method. As a second method for detecting interactions, we used site-directed mutagenesis to construct multiple mutations in the anticodon loop. These multiple mutants are very weak suppressors and have translational activities that are equal to or lower than that predicted for the independent action of single mutations.

40|$|Background: The {{suppression}} of <b>amber</b> stop <b>codons</b> with non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) {{is used for}} the site-specific introduction of many unusual functions into proteins. Specific orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (o-aaRS) /amber suppressor tRNA CUA pairs (o-pairs) for the incorporation of ncAAs in S. cerevisiae were previously selected from an E. coli tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNACUA mutant library. Incorporation fidelity relies on the specificity of the o-aaRSs for their ncAAs and the ability to effectively discriminate against their natural substrate Tyr or any other canonical amino acid. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used o-pairs previously developed for ncAAs carrying reactive alkyne-, azido-, or photocrosslinker side chains to suppress an amber mutant of human superoxide dismutase 1 in S. cerevisiae. We found worse incorporation efficiencies of the alkyne- and the photocrosslinker ncAAs than reported earlier. In our hands, amber suppression with the ncAA containing the azido group did not occur at all. In addition to the incorporation experiments in S. cerevisiae, we analyzed the catalytic properties of the o-aaRSs in vitro. Surprisingly, all o-aaRSs showed much higher preference for their natural substrate Tyr than for any of the tested ncAAs. While it is unclear why efficiently recognized Tyr is not inserted at <b>amber</b> <b>codons,</b> we speculate that metabolically inert ncAAs accumulate in the cell, and for this reason they are incorporated despite being weak substrates for the o-aaRSs.
