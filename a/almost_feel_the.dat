25|$|As that Beatles song played, I {{became a}} killer. Joe Colucci {{was going to}} die. I {{was going to kill}} him because he was {{plotting}} to kill me. I felt the rage inside me.... Everything went in slow motion. I could <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> bullet leaving the gun and entering his skull. It was strange. I didn't hear the first shot. I didn't see any blood. His head didn't seem to move.... I felt like I was a million miles away, like this was all a dream.|$|E

Gleiberman praised the choice of scenery, writing that the [...] "moss-dark, saturated images have a redolent sensuality" [...] that makes the film very realistic. The Hollywood Reporter said of Newman's score, [...] "at its best moments, alights with radiant textures and sprightly grace notes, nicely emblematic of the film's central them," [...] and Klady describing it as [...] "the right balance between the somber and the absurd".|$|E
500|$|... "Blown Away" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. A reviewer for Billboard thought that Mark Bright's [...] "brooding, atmospheric" [...] production and Underwood's vocal performance [...] "elevate this cinematic tune to an instant classic." [...] They further commented, [...] "When the girl shuts {{herself in the}} storm cellar, leaving her alcoholic father {{passed out on the}} couch in the path of a twister, you can <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> wind." [...] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood thought that the song confirmed the description of the album as [...] "a turn toward darkness from a singer who first topped the country chart with 'Jesus, Take the Wheel'." [...] USA Today columnist Brian Mansfield thought the song's [...] "synthesizers, strings sounds, vocal overdubs and echoing guitars" [...] combined dramatically, creating a [...] "neo-80s feel - think an Oklahoma version of the Eurythmics." [...] "Blown Away" [...] received a five-star rating from Billy Dukes of Taste of Country, who called it [...] "dangerous, but irresistible." [...] He also praised Underwood for recording darker material than her previous singles. Also giving it five stars, Bobby Peacock of Roughstock called it [...] "more grandiose" [...] than Underwood's previous efforts, also saying that it [...] "makes itself known by sounding like absolutely nothing else on radio." [...] Chris Richards of The Washington Post gave the song a mixed review, deeming the lyrics as [...] "gripping", but negatively comparing the instrumentation to the work of Taylor Swift.|$|E

500|$|Sinatra became {{increasingly}} {{frustrated with the}} status of the Harry James band, feeling that he was not achieving the major success and acclaim he was looking for. His pianist and close friend Hank Sanicola persuaded him to stay with the group, but in November 1939 he left James to replace Jack Leonard as the lead singer of the Tommy Dorsey band. Sinatra signed a contract with Dorsey for $125 a week at Palmer House in Chicago, and James agreed amicably to release Sinatra from his contract. On January 26, 1940, he made his first public appearance with the band at the Coronado Theatre in Rockford, Illinois, opening the show with [...] "Stardust". Dorsey recalled: [...] "You could <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> excitement coming up out of the crowds when the kid stood up to sing. Remember, he was no matinée idol. He was just a skinny kid with big ears. I used to stand there so amazed I'd almost forget to take my own solos". Dorsey was a major influence on Sinatra and became a father figure. Sinatra copied Dorsey's mannerisms and traits, becoming a demanding perfectionist like him, even adopting his hobby of toy trains. He asked Dorsey to be godfather to his daughter Nancy in June 1940. Sinatra later said that [...] "The only two people I've ever been afraid of are my mother and Tommy Dorsey". Though Kelley claims that Sinatra and drummer Buddy Rich were bitter rivals, other authors state that they were friends and even roommates when the band was on the road, but professional jealousy surfaced as both men wanted to be considered the star of Dorsey's band. Later, Sinatra helped Rich form his own band with a $25,000 loan and provided financial help to Rich during times of the drummer's serious illness.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé's {{version of}} [...] "Resentment" [...] {{received}} positive reviews from critics, {{most of whom}} noted the soulful vocal stylings used in the song. Bill Lamb of About.com complimented the song {{as one of the}} album highlights and described it as [...] "gospel-influenced" [...] and [...] "emotion filled" [...] song. A writer of Billboard magazine stated that Beyoncé [...] "shifts into emotive mode" [...] on this song from [...] "rockier, edgier" [...] sound of album and noted that the track [...] "calls to mind the subtle fervor and passion of the best girl groups of the '60s and '70s". Brian Hiatt from Rolling Stone marked the track as [...] "one of the most arresting moments" [...] on the album and described it as an [...] "anguished, sixties-tinged ballad". Spence Abbott of IGN also noted track as a stand out alongside [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] and observed that [...] " [...] track goes straight for Aretha Franklin-inspired territory, with Beyoncé actually getting gritty and dropping her high octave range down a few pegs to get guttural and downright Old School soulful". Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that the [...] "agitated goodbye" [...] builds a different kind of overwrought drama. Steve Jones of USA Today the song showcases Beyoncé's [...] "maturing vocal chops," [...] describing the song as spare and gritty. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that the song would have been better if performed by a trio of [...] "talented" [...] vocalists, such as Destiny's Child, rather than Beyoncé by herself. Houston Chronicles Joey Guerra felt that [...] "Doubters of Beyoncé's immense talent need only give one listen to this track [...] from 2006's B'Day. It's a stunner — a visceral, emotional showcase that casts Beyoncé as a scorned, sorrowful woman. You can <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> pain in her delivery." [...] According to a writer of Irish Independent, the song gives a more soulful feel to B'Day. Jim Farber of Daily News called [...] "Resentment" [...] an [...] "old-school soul shouter". Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker described the song as a [...] "fierce ballad". [...] "Resentment" [...] peaked at number 11 on the US Bubbling Under R/Hip-Hop Singles chart, which acts as an extension to the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs.|$|E
2500|$|Jakala commended the art because [...] "Tsugihara helps {{distinguish}} characters {{by giving}} everyone distinctive looks." [...] Further, he appreciated how the detailing on body language and facial expressions, saying, [...] "In one scene, I could <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> intensity of Sakuragi's gaze {{coming off the}} page." [...] RAC's commenator also asserted there are [...] "lots of careful shots of people's faces to show their reactions", and deemed Tsugihara's art very suitable to the series, calling it [...] "a solid, straight-forward style" [...] and comparing it to storyboards for a television show or a film.|$|E

Stevenson was attracted to the character's difficulties, finding the role confronting and challenging. He describes playing the role as [...] "a very intimidating process and a lonely one. Each day I turned up to set, and began getting dressed, I could <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> character laughing at me saying, ‘Well, let’s see what you get today.’" [...] One critic summarised his impression of the character as [...] "Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails wearing ping-pong balls as contact lenses." ...|$|E
2500|$|David McComb is the {{principal}} songwriter, [...] "it's upon [...] shoulders {{that most of the}} weight has been borne. It's the weight of lyrics which have been far more personal now... so intensely personal you can <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> pain". Wilson Neate of Perfect Sound Forever found that a [...] "sense of alienation, betrayal, insanity and solitude still permeates his writing, although Calenture seems less explicitly imbued with Western Australian imagery than the previous records". [...] Mathur and Phillips describe the album as [...] "far and away the most 'produced' record The Triffids have ever done... packed full of little electronic surprises: drum computers, synthesisers, samplers, even a gadget that goes 'woop'".|$|E
2500|$|The Colts {{began their}} first {{offensive}} series {{on their own}} 27-yard line. Quarterback Earl Morrall completed a 19-yard pass to tight end John Mackey and then running back Tom Matte ran for 10 yards to place {{the ball on the}} Jets' 44-yard line. Jerry Hill's runs of 7 and 5 yards picked up another Colts first down, then Morrall's pass to tight end Tom Mitchell gained 15 yards on third and thirteen and saw the ball placed at the Jets' 19-yard line. In scoring position, Morrall attempted to score quickly against a reeling Jets defense. Receiver Willie Richardson dropped Morrall's pass on first down followed by an incompletion on second down after Mitchell was overthrown. On third down, none of his receivers were open and Morrall was tackled at the line of scrimmage by Al Atkinson. Michaels was brought out to attempt a 27-yard field goal, but it was wide left.

In a 645-page book, Bradmanlike in research and presentation, Perry provides far more biographical and character detail on The Don and his life than previously published.’ The Sydney Sunday Telegraph’s Peter Lalor said: ‘Perry keeps a compelling pace in the work... The Don always let his cricket do the talking and so does the author. Perry brings to life the various innings with colourful and detailed descriptions of the shots, bowling and fielding... a good read and a handy bench-mark for all the modern hysteria [...] about Brian Lara and Steve Waugh, two fine players whose averages and performances are but a shadow of The Don’s.’ ...|$|E

[...] Like other Police songs from this period, it features mythological and literary references, including the Scylla and Charybdis monsters of Greek mythology, and the German legend of Faust. It has a relatively slow, <b>almost</b> foreboding <b>feel</b> in <b>the</b> beginning verses, modulating to evoke a lighter, triumphant <b>feel</b> during <b>the</b> chorus.|$|R

He and his family migrated to Australia in 1958, where he worked as a labourer for several years before attending the National Gallery School in Melbourne.

It is even possible to <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> what <b>the</b> main [...] "character" [...] is feeling.
