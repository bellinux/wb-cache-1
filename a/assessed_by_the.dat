5|$|As of June 26, 2011, the {{conservation}} status of Dendroaspis angusticeps {{has not been}} <b>assessed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> IUCN. The eastern green mamba is, however, a fairly common species of snake throughout its geographical range, and populations {{are believed to be}} stable. Large concentrations of two to three individuals per hectare have been documented in coastal Kenya and southern Tanzania, and in one instance a group of five eastern green mambas were seen in a single tree. Although populations of this species are stable, habitat destruction and deforestation may pose a possible threat to this species.|$|E
5|$|At 1200UTC on July13, the JTWC {{upgraded}} Billie {{further to}} typhoon status, making Billie the first tropical cyclone {{to be monitored}} by the JTWC since its inception earlier in 1959. Now tracking steadily towards the northwest, the typhoon reached its peak intensity at 1200UTC {{the next day with}} maximum sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph) according to the JTWC and a minimum barometric pressure <b>assessed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) at 970mbar (hPa; 28.64inHg). By this time Billie's eye had shrunk to a size roughly 50km (30mi) in diameter. At 0900UTC on July15, Billie passed just 30km (20mi) north of Taiwan; fifteen hours later the typhoon made landfall north of Fuzhou, China in Zhejiang with winds estimated at 120km/h (75mph).|$|E
5|$|British {{officials}} filed two lawsuits {{stemming from}} the Liberty incident: an in rem suit against the ship, and an in personam suit against Hancock. Royal officials, as well as Hancock's accuser, stood to gain financially, since, as was the custom, any penalties <b>assessed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> court would be awarded to the governor, the informer, and the Crown, each getting a third. The first suit, filed on June 22, 1768, resulted in the confiscation of the Liberty in August. Customs officials then used the ship to enforce trade regulations until it was burned by angry colonists in Rhode Island the following year.|$|E

5|$|Didsbury has a non-selective {{education}} system, <b>assessed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> SATs exam. There {{are seven}} primary schools and two state comprehensive secondary schools. The Barlow RC High School {{is one of}} those chosen by Manchester Council to benefit from funding made available in wave 4 of the government's Building Schools for the Future programme, a national scheme for the refurbishment and remodelling of every secondary school in England. It is planned to replace all the current buildings, which date back to 1951. Parrs Wood and The Barlow were two of only six schools in Manchester to achieve the Manchester Inclusion Standard in 2007, awarded by Manchester Council to those schools doing innovative work to ensure that all their pupils are able to participate fully in the school's activities.|$|E
5|$|On October18, another {{period of}} {{intensification}} took {{place as the}} storm neared the northern Philippines. Early in the day, Elsie was upgraded to a super typhoon, a storm with winds of at least 240km/h (150mph). Hours before making landfall in Luzon, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category 5 super typhoon with winds of 260km/h (160mph) and a barometric pressure of 898hPa (mbar). The peak intensity of Elsie was <b>assessed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> JMA at the same time. They reported that the typhoon attained winds of 175km/h (115mph 10-minute sustained) and a minimum pressure of 915hPa (mbar).

5|$|The {{chestnut}} sparrow {{is found}} in East Africa in mostly lower country from Darfur through Kordofan, South Sudan, Somalia, Uganda, and Kenya to north-central Tanzania. Its range also extends northeast into the southwest and Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Like the golden sparrows, it is sometimes nomadic when not breeding. Vagrants have been recorded as far from their breeding range as Dar es Salaam. It is found mostly in dry savanna and in fields and villages, but unlike its relations the golden sparrows, it is sometimes found in swamps of papyrus (certain Cyperus spp.). Its population has not been quantified, but {{it appears to be}} common across a very large range and it is <b>assessed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> IUCN Red List as Least Concern for global extinction.|$|E

5|$|In late May 2011, Sukhoi {{delivered}} the first Su-35S to Akhtubinsk to conduct state joint tests with the Defence Ministry {{to prepare the}} aircraft for operational service. Before {{the start of the}} tests, the aircraft's Su-35's avionics and integrated defence systems were reportedly not up to the standard of American aircraft. The first of two stages of the trials commenced in August 2011. By March 2012, the two prototypes and four production aircraft were conducting flights as the air force tested the type's technical characteristics, which were <b>assessed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end of that year to have generally complied with requirements. Of the batch of six production aircraft that were handed over in December 2012, five flew to the Gromov Flight Research Institute in Zhukovsky where the aircraft would, in February 2013, start the second stage of the trials. This stage, which was scheduled to last eighteen months, would focus on the Su-35's weapons and manoeuvrability in combat.|$|E

5|$|The House of Lords' {{statement}} on parliamentary privilege was <b>assessed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, which recommended that Parliament not counter {{the decision in}} Pepper v Hart, but cautioned that this should not lead to any further weakening of parliamentary privilege. However, academics widely condemned the decision and the thinking behind it. Academic Aileen Kavanagh questioned the logic used; the House of Lords was essentially saying that, where a minister has made a statement about an act's intent that was not questioned by Parliament, that statement {{can be used as}} evidence. However, there are many reasons why Members of Parliament might not question a statement, and this does not necessarily indicate that they approve of it; {{in the case of the}} Finance Act, for example, it could simply be that as the statement was not going to be added to the statute, they found no reason to actively oppose it. At the same time, different Members of Parliament may approve of a statutory provision for different reasons. The fact that a minister gives certain reasons for including a provision does not necessarily indicate that Parliament agrees; only that Parliament also feels, for whatever reason, that the provision should be included. The decision also raises questions about the separation of powers in the United Kingdom; it has been consistently maintained that it is Parliament, not the executive, which passes legislation. If one accepts that statements by the executive can allow them to specify the meaning of particular laws without formally including them in statutes where they can be approved by Parliament, it violates this separation of powers, allowing the executive to make law.|$|E
