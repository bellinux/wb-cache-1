5|$|In the 2003–04 season, the Spurs began {{featuring}} Ginóbili more regularly, starting him in {{half of the}} 77 {{regular season}} games in which he played. His statistics improved in all major categories, as he averaged 12.8 points, 4.5 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.8 steals per game. During the 2004 playoffs, the Spurs met their perennial rivals, the Los Angeles Lakers, in the Western Conference Semifinals. Following Game 5 where Derek Fisher scored a buzzer-beating jump shot, the Spurs lost Game 6 and the series 4–2. While Ginóbili did not start in a single playoff game <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> 2003, his playoff statistics improved significantly, with 13.0 points, 5.3 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game.|$|E
5|$|In the {{off-season}} Shero {{decided that the}} team would be more successful if he coached them like he had coached his minor league teams. Upon being elevated to the NHL, he {{had decided not to}} employ systems like he did in the minors, stating that he had too much respect for NHL players. However, he decided that since he had the same kind of players on the Flyers <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the minors, he would use the same systems, becoming the first coach to employ systems.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Reed {{concluded}} the first drive of Super Bowl XLIII with a field goal—giving the Steelers a 3–0 lead over the Arizona Cardinals. Gary Russell {{scored on a}} 1-yard touchdown rush on the Steelers' second drive and the Cardinals responded by scoring a touchdown on the ensuing drive. On the final play {{of the first half}} James Harrison intercepted a pass from Kurt Warner and returned it 100yards for a touchdown. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the first quarter, Reed scored the sole points of the third quarter giving the Steelers a 20–7 lead entering the final quarter.|$|E

5|$|L. Neil Smith {{wrote the}} {{alternate}} history novel The Probability Broach in 1980 {{as part of}} his North American Confederacy Series. In it, Albert Gallatin joins the rebellion in 1794 to benefit the farmers, rather than the fledgling US Government <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> reality. This results in the rebellion becoming a Second American Revolution. This eventually leads to George Washington being overthrown and executed for treason, the abrogation of the Constitution, and Gallatin being proclaimed the second president and serving as president until 1812.|$|E
5|$|Many {{members of}} {{the cast and crew}} had worked with Lang on his earlier films.

Klein-Rogge acted in Lang's earlier films including Destiny, Die Nibelungen, Metropolis and Spies. Otto Wernicke reprises his role as Inspector Lohmann from Lang's M.

5|$|Rupert Murdoch {{announced}} in early February 2007 that Baron Cohen had {{signed on to}} do another Borat film with Fox. However, this was contradicted by an interview with Baron Cohen himself in which Baron Cohen stated that Borat was to be discontinued, as he was now too well known to avoid detection <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the film and on Da Ali G Show. A spokesman for Fox later stated {{that it was too}} early to begin planning such a film, although they were open to the idea.|$|E
5|$|Usama's life in Hisn Kayfa is very obscure, but he {{travelled}} {{throughout the}} region, and probably wrote {{many of his}} works there. In 1174 Usama was invited to Damascus to serve Saladin, who had succeeded Nur ad-Din earlier that year and {{was a friend of}} Usama's son Murhaf. Usama lived in semi-retirement, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> Hisn Kayfa, and often met with Saladin to discuss literature and warfare. He may have also taught poetry and hadith in Damascus, and held poetry salons for Saladin and his chief men, including al-Qadi al-Fadl and Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani. He died on November 17, 1188. He was buried in Damascus on Mount Qasiyun, although the tomb is now lost.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Rodríguez {{returned}} to throwing out runners attempting {{to steal a}} base {{at a very high}} percentage, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> his earlier career; he was first in the league in this category, throwing out 45.7percent of all runners attempting to steal a base. On May 9, 2006, Rodríguez played first base for the Tigers. That game, a 7–6 loss to the Baltimore Orioles, {{was the first time that}} he played a position other than catcher in his 1,914 Major League games. On August 15, 2006, he also made his first Major League appearance at second base after regular second baseman Plácido Polanco was injured in a game in Boston. Rodríguez was honored with a Fielding Bible Award as the best fielding catcher in MLB in 2006. Rodríguez would help the Tigers upset the Yankees in the 2006 ALDS and the A's in the 2006 ALCS to help Detroit win the pennant.|$|E

5|$|On July 13, 2014, Lin was traded, {{along with}} a 2015 first and second round pick, to the Los Angeles Lakers in {{exchange}} for the rights to Serhiy Lishchuk. The Rockets made the move to clear cap space in their attempt to sign free agent Chris Bosh. The Lakers owed Lin $15 million for 2014–15, the final year of his contract, but only $8.3 million counted against their salary cap. His role was undefined with the Lakers, who were just 21–61 in his only season with the team. Lin moved into the starting lineup late in the preseason after an injury to Ronnie Price, and he started the first 20 games of the season. However, he struggled in coach Byron Scott's offense, which was based on the methodical player and ball movement of the Princeton offense, while Lin was most comfortable dominating the ball while attacking off the pick-and-roll <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> New York and Houston.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{survived the}} last 15 {{minutes on the}} first evening to reach stumps on 0/17, with Morris on 10. Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before the latter was bowled by Jim Laker's off spin for 31. Barnes batted confidently, while the {{hesitant}} Morris shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes, During this period, Morris unnecessarily played at a ball outside off stump from seamer Alec Bedser and edged it to wicket-keeper Evans, who dropped the catch. He recomposed himself and hit left arm orthodox spinner Jack Young's first ball—a full toss—for runs as Australia passed 50 without loss. Morris fell {{when he tried to}} force a ball from Laker away, but hit it from the middle of his bat into his back pad; the ball rebounded onto the stumps. Australia went on to amass 509, and when England batted again, they lost their third wicket at 150. Joe Hardstaff junior came in, and on the third ball he aimed a cut that went low to second slip, just <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the first innings. However, Morris dropped the catch. Hardstaff exploited his second chance to make 43 before falling at 4/243.|$|E
