500|$|Massa's {{touch on}} Hamilton's car on lap two was {{labelled}} by the McLaren driver [...] "as deliberate {{as it could}} be". Massa rejected the allegation, saying [...] "I had two wheels on the gravel. I could not stop the car <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the gravel because he pushed me into the gravel." [...] Media coverage of the incident suggested that though the contact was Massa's fault, it was unintentional. Simon Arron, writing for The Daily Telegraph, said Hamilton's accusation of deliberate contact was [...] "unworthy and unwise", adding that the contact was simply a racing incident. The gap between the drivers in the Drivers' Championship after the race stood at five points, in Hamilton's favour, with two races remaining. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren's failure to score points, combined with Ferrari's third and seventh, moved Ferrari to a seven-point lead.|$|E

Crowe incorporates how his own fatherhood informed his reading of the script to portray Jor-El, stating that [...] "...it {{was one of those}} things where that's how it was connecting me. That's the question that Jor-El faces, that's the situation that he's in." [...] Crowe also comments on his preparation for the film stating that: [...] "When I signed on... well, one, I didn't realize that I would be wearing Spandex—'cause you know that's Superman's costume—I didn't realize that I'd have to fit into it as well," [...] Crowe said. [...] "But, I also didn't realize the type of organizer that Zack Snyder is, 'cause this was really old school prep. This is sort of David Lean-level preparation, and I really appreciated him. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the movie for three-and-a-half or four months before I even got in front of the camera." ...|$|E
500|$|Wilkinson, by then Leeds United manager, {{returned}} to his former club in July 1991 to sign two young centre-backs, Jon Newsome first and Wetherall a few days later, for a combined fee of £275,000. The 20-year-old Wetherall's first season at Leeds was {{the final year of}} his degree course, so he played for the reserves while training part-time. He made a brief debut in the First Division, on 3 September 1991 at Elland Road as a late substitute against Arsenal; Leeds {{went on to win the}} 1991–92 league title. He remembers it as [...] "With 20 minutes to go, we were 2–1 down <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the touchline ready to go on, then Lee Chapman scored and the gaffer (Howard Wilkinson) told me to sit down again. But he threw me on for the last two minutes. I always tell people that made the difference in winning the title!" [...] As his teammates took the league trophy on a celebratory open top bus tour, Wetherall chose to revise for his examinations, a decision he came to regret, because [...] "those experiences don't come around that often". Though the revision bore fruit: he graduated with first-class honours.|$|E

2500|$|Willa Holland portrays Kaitlin Cooper (season 4, {{recurring}} season 1, 3). The {{role was}} originally played by Shailene Woodley in a recurring role during Season 1. Kaitlin {{spends much of}} the series at boarding school before returning on a recurring basis in season 3 (now played by Holland) and finally becoming a regular character in season 4. The daughter of Jimmy Cooper and Julie Cooper-Nichol and sister to Marissa Cooper, her personality is more similar to her mother's rather than her father's, and she is portrayed as a regular pot smoker and occasional dealer. Holland observed that [...] "no one can control her" [...] but that her arc in Season 4 finds the character maturing. When asked about any disappointment over the recast, Shailene Woodley responded that, [...] "I was 11 <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> as a guest, recurring character, or whatever. My character went to boarding school and {{when they decided to}} bring her back, they actually re-auditioned me to bring her back. But I didn't go through puberty until late (...)
