5|$|Convinced {{that these}} heavy-handed tactics were {{the source of}} the {{alienation}} of the native population to Soviet rule, in 1921 Moscow appointed an experienced administrator, Alexander Miasnikian, to carry out a more moderate policy and one better <b>attuned</b> <b>to</b> Armenian sensibilities. With the introduction of the New Economic Policy (NEP), Armenians began to enjoy a period of relative stability. Life under the Soviet rule proved to be a soothing balm in contrast to the turbulent final years of the Ottoman Empire. The Armenians received medicine, food, as well as other provisions from the central government and extensive literacy reforms were carried out. The situation was difficult for the Armenian Apostolic Church, however, which became a regular target of criticism in educational books and in the media and struggled greatly under Communism.|$|E
5|$|Docter {{recruited}} a story crew to {{help develop}} the film's plot line. Although animation as an industry had been dominated by men, half of the story crew were women, {{in an attempt to}} have more diverse input. The choice to focus the film on a girl came from research that claimed that females age 11 to 17 are more <b>attuned</b> <b>to</b> expressions and emotions than others. The idea to have Riley play hockey came from Del Carmen, who observed that the sport is very popular in Minnesota. They tried to stray away from stereotypically feminine interests, such as the color pink or dresses. Initial ideas for the film found the main character, Riley, falling into a deep depression: Docter later felt they were inappropriate and scrapped them, although in the final film Riley does sink into a depression.|$|E

5|$|Elected {{with support}} from the Farmers' Alliance {{and as a result of}} {{agricultural}} protest, Tillman was thought likely to join the Populists in their challenge to the established parties. Tillman refused, and generally opposed Populist positions that went beyond his program of increasing access to higher education and reform of the Democratic Party (white supremacy was not a Populist position). The Alliance (and Populists) demanded a system of subtreasuries under the federal government, that could accept farmers' crops and advance them 80 percent of the value interest-free. Tillman, not wanting more federal officeholders in the state (that in Republican administrations might be filled by African Americans), initially opposed the proposal. Many farmers felt strongly about this issue, and in 1891, Tillman was censured by the state Alliance for his opposition. <b>Attuned</b> <b>to</b> political necessities, Tillman gradually came to support the subtreasuries in time for his re-election campaign in 1892, though he was never an active proponent.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{angelshark}} {{is primarily}} a visual hunter; experiments in nature show that they strike at fish-shaped targets without any electrical, chemical, vibrational, or behavioral cues. At night, they are guided by the bioluminescence of planktonic dinoflagellates and ostracods disturbed by moving prey. This species' visual system is <b>attuned</b> <b>to</b> the wavelengths of light emitted by these planktonic organisms, showing the importance of night hunting. Pacific angelsharks {{are more likely to}} strike at prey approaching from the front. It usually waits until the prey approaches to , as its attack is less accurate beyond this distance. The strike is a stereotyped behavior in which the shark presses the forward lobes of its pectoral fins against the bottom and thrusts its head upwards at up to a 90° angle. Its mouth forms a tube when opened, creating a suction force, while its jaws protude forward to secure the prey between sharp teeth. During the strike, the eyes roll backward into the head for protection. The strike is often completed in under a tenth of a second.|$|E
5|$|The {{activation}} of the French First Army left Seventh Army with only one corps. Devers asked for IV Corps to be transferred from Italy, but Wilson argued that this would adversely affect operations in Italy against the Gothic Line, and the Combined Chiefs agreed. Instead, Devers proposed on 26 September that Major General Wade H. Haislip's XV Corps to be transferred from Patton's Third Army, which had severe logistical difficulties, to the Seventh Army. Devers argued that they could better be supported over the 6th Army Group's line of communications from the Mediterranean. Eisenhower agreed, and further ordered that three more divisions scheduled to join Bradley's 12th Army Group in northern France, but unlikely to do so until the supply and transport situation improved, be diverted to Marseilles, and join the 6th Army Group. Haislip was {{a good choice for}} the 6th Army Group. He spoke French fluently, having fought in France during World War I and attended the Ecole Superieure de Guerre from 1925 to 1927, and was <b>attuned</b> <b>to</b> French sensibilities. Above all, Haislip got along well with Major General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, the mercurial commander of the French 2nd Armored Division. Devers was shocked when Leclerc informed him that he and his men wanted to serve with the American Army, not the French First Army, which he considered dominated by Vichy French traitors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Music {{performance}} is an important, wellstructured setting for evaluating a robot’s ability to detect, understand and respond appropriately to complex human activity. Social {{tasks such as}} cooperative performance require participants to detect, interpret and <b>attune</b> <b>to</b> the actions of their partners quickly and accurately. The synthesis of multiple sensory perceptions may be a fruitful approach to this problem. In order to evaluate this approach, we programmed a humanoid robot, Nico, to play a drum in concert with human drummers and {{at the direction of}} a human conductor. Our results show that sensory integration can enable precise synchronization in social tasks even when perceptual data is imperfect, misleading and subject to extensive processing delay. By integrating several streams of information – visual, auditory, and proprioceptive – Nico can <b>attune</b> <b>to</b> a tempo that is set by a human conductor, in concert with human performers. Nico continuously evaluates its perceptions of its own actions and those of the humans around it, dealing with unforeseen changes in tempo and affect in real time. I...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{a rhythmic}} sense comes early in {{childhood}} development, and appears crucial for learning speech {{as well as}} music. Synchronized, rhythmic movements governed by oscillators play significant roles in industrial robots, but only in tightly controlled, precisely defined environments. Prior research focuses on the synchronization of the robot’s control system to either proprioceptive signals or external physical oscillators. Social tasks, however, require participants to detect, interpret and <b>attune</b> <b>to</b> the activity of humans, and by extension, to their intentions and perceptions. The synthesis of multiple sensory perceptions may be a fruitful approach to this problem.
