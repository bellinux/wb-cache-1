The designation was applied following {{the completion of the}} interchanges at the QEW and Highway401 as well as the expansion of the section between them into a collector-express system.|$|E
5|$|In {{the field}} of {{military}} organisation, Napoleon borrowed from previous theorists such as Jacques Antoine Hippolyte, Comte de Guibert, and from the reforms of preceding French governments, and then developed much of what was <b>already</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b> He continued the policy, which emerged from the Revolution, of promotion based primarily on merit.|$|E
5|$|Elie Wiesel {{was born}} on 30 September 1928 in Sighet, a town in the Carpathian {{mountains}} of northern Transylvania, to Chlomo Wiesel, a shopkeeper, and his wife, Sarah, née Feig. The family lived {{in a community of}} 10,000–20,000 mostly Orthodox Jews. Northern Transylvania had been annexed by Hungary in 1940, and restrictions on Jews were <b>already</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> but the period Wiesel discusses {{at the beginning of the}} book, 1941–1943, was a relatively calm one for the Jewish population.|$|E

5|$|Screenshots of Zelda: Gaiden {{released}} in August 1999 show unmistakable {{elements of the}} final version of Majora's Mask, such as the large clock that dominates the center of Clock Town, the timer {{at the bottom of the}} screen, and the Goron Mask. Story and gameplay details revealed later that month show that the story concept as well as the use of transformation masks were <b>already</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
5|$|Throughout Sri Lanka, {{the floods}} {{destroyed}} at least 24,750homes and damaged 32,426others, displacing about 800,000people, {{many of whom}} lost everything they owned. Total damage was estimated at $135million (2003USD), primarily to homes and roads. Across the island, floods related to the cyclone killed 260people. Most of the deaths were along the nation's southern coast where the floods occurred, primarily along the Kalu River, and were mainly farmers. Levees helped drain floodwaters where systems were <b>already</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although the {{accident}} investigation found that procedures and policies were supposedly <b>already</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> {{to prevent such}} a crash from occurring again, {{the fact that this}} crash occurred showed that in at least one instance, the existing safety policies and their enforcement had been grievously inadequate. To re-emphasize the importance of adherence to existing safety policies and correcting the actions of anyone violating them at any time, the USAF quickly distributed the findings of {{the accident}} investigation throughout the service. These measures failed to prevent – sixteen years later – the occurrence in almost identical circumstances of another accident, when a C-17 transport aircraft crashed shortly after taking off from Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, on an aerial-display practice flight.|$|E
5|$|Australian coastwatchers {{stationed}} on New Britain were reinforced during September and October 1943 {{to provide}} warning of air attacks from Rabaul {{bound for the}} Allied landing sites and to report on Japanese barge and troop movements. In addition to a coastwatching team <b>already</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> at Cape Orford near Wide Bay, five other parties were sent to Cape Hoskins, Gasmata, Open Bay (on the north coast {{at the base of}} the Gazelle Peninsula), the area south of Wide Bay, and the neck between Wide Bay and Open Bay. The Gasmata party was discovered by the Japanese while en route to its destination and eliminated, but the other teams were in place by the end of October.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{works on}} the pyramid of Neferefre had just begun when Neferefre died {{unexpectedly}} in his early twenties. At the time of Nyuserre's ascension to the throne, only one step of the core of Neferefre's pyramid had been completed. The substructures, built in a large open pit {{at the center of}} the pyramid were possibly unfinished as well. Nyuserre hastily completed the pyramid by transforming it into a stylised primeval mound resembling a mastaba: the walls of the core layer <b>already</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> were covered with limestone and the top was filled with clay and stones drawn from the local desert.|$|E

5|$|On June1, the American Red Cross set up {{a shelter}} at the Redlands Community College in El Reno for victims of the storm. The {{following}} day, Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin toured damaged areas of El Reno. Due to the tornadoes that occurred previously on May20, {{a state of emergency}} was <b>already</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> for the affected areas, allowing residents to quickly obtain emergency assistance. Residents left homeless were provided with temporary housing constructed from shipping containers. Each container was fitted with a kitchen, bedroom, living room, and bathroom.|$|E
5|$|Restrictions on Jews were <b>already</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> {{before the}} invasion, {{including}} a prohibition on marrying Christians. After the invasion, Randolph Braham writes, the Hungarian government immediately {{began the process}} of isolating Jews {{from the rest of}} the community. From 5 April Jews over the age of six had to wear a 3.8 x 3.8inch (10 x 10cm) yellow badge. They were forbidden from using telephones, owning cars or radios, travelling or moving home, and had to declare the value of their property. Jewish civil servants, journalists and lawyers were sacked, non-Jews could not work in Jewish households. Books by Jews were removed from libraries and Jewish authors could no longer be published.|$|E
5|$|Sam Jones III plays Pete Ross, another {{best friend}} of Clark's {{and the first}} person to whom Clark voluntarily tells his secret. Although he is in love with Chloe, he does not admit it because of the Clark-Lana-Chloe love {{triangle}} <b>already</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b> Ross was written out of the series at the end of season three, but made a guest appearance in season seven. Jones was the last of the series regulars to be cast, with Gough and Millar seeing him four days before they began filming the pilot. In the comics Ross is Caucasian, but the producers chose to cast Jones (who is African-American).|$|E

5|$|The word spanyell {{is thought}} to date from the late 12th century when {{it was used to}} name a type of dog {{imported}} into England from Spain, with the span part of the word referring to the country of origin. Records from the mid-14th century show that selective breeding was <b>already</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> with the breed being separated into two distinct types, called water spaniels and land spaniels. By 1801, the smaller variety of land spaniel was called the Cocker or Cocking Spaniel, so named for its use in flushing woodcock.|$|E
5|$|Two {{special classes}} of protein {{deal with the}} ionic {{gradients}} found across cellular and sub-cellular membranes in nature- ion channels and ion pumps. Both pumps and channels are integral membrane proteins that pass through the bilayer, but their roles are quite different. Ion pumps are the proteins that build and maintain the chemical gradients by utilizing an external energy source to move ions against the concentration gradient to an area of higher chemical potential. The energy source can be ATP, {{as is the case}} for the Na+-K+ ATPase. Alternatively, the energy source can be another chemical gradient <b>already</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> as in the Ca2+/Na+ antiporter. It is through the action of ion pumps that cells are able to regulate pH via the pumping of protons.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{stressed}} {{that he intended}} to bring a better style of play to the team in the coming season but admitted that players would have to be sold to balance the books. Deals were <b>already</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> to sell Jamie Ward to Derby County for an undisclosed fee, and sign Danny Philliskirk from Chelsea on a free transfer, but Wilson also added to the squad in June by signing Lecsinel Jean-François from his former club Swindon Town, also on a free transfer. After much speculation, and with the players about to return for pre-season training, Darius Henderson was sold to Millwall for an undisclosed fee in order to free up money on the wage bill.|$|E

5|$|Above all, however, Joseph {{attempted}} {{to break up}} the structure of autonomous states which provided the framework for the Austrian Netherlands. He introduced two reforms in early 1787 instituting new administrative and judicial reform to create a much more centralised system. The first decree abolished many of the administrative structures which had existed since the rule of Emperor Charles V (1500–58) were replaced by a single General Council of Government under a minister-plenipotentiary. In addition, nine administrative circles (cercles), each controlled by an Intendant, were created to which much {{of the power of the}} states was devolved. A second decree abolished the ad hoc semi-feudal or ecclesiastical courts operated by the states and replaced them with a centralised system similar to that <b>already</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> in Austria. A single Sovereign Council of Justice was established in Brussels, with two appeal courts in Brussels and Luxembourg, and around 40 local district courts.|$|E
5|$|After {{extensive}} research {{that began in}} the 90s, a second push took place in March 2003, when the Brazilian subsidiary of Volkswagen launched to the market the first full flexible-fuel car, the Gol 1.6 Total Flex. Several months later was followed by other Brazilian automakers, and by 2010 General Motors, Fiat, Ford, Peugeot, Renault, Volkswagen, Honda, Mitsubishi, Toyota, Citroën, Nissan and Kia Motors were producing popular models of flex cars and light trucks. The adoption of ethanol flex fuel vehicles was so successful, that production of flex cars went from almost 40 thousand in 2003 to 1.7 million in 2007. This rapid adoption of the flex technology was facilitated by the fuel distribution infrastructure <b>already</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> as around 27,000 filling stations countrywide were available by 1997 with at least one ethanol pump, a heritage of the Pró-Álcool program.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conservation}} {{concern was}} made public in September 2008 when the Canadian government decided {{it was not necessary}} to enforce further protections (including the Species at Risk Act in place to protect endangered animals along their habitats) for killer whales aside from the laws <b>already</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b> In response to this decision, six environmental groups sued the federal government, claiming killer whales were facing many threats on the British Columbia Coast and the federal government did nothing to protect them from these threats. A legal and scientific nonprofit organization, Ecojustice, led the lawsuit and represented the David Suzuki Foundation, Environmental Defence, Greenpeace Canada, International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Raincoast Conservation Foundation, and the Wilderness Committee. Many scientists involved in this lawsuit, including Bill Wareham, a marine scientist with the David Suzuki Foundation, noted increased boat traffic, water toxic wastes, and low salmon population as major threats, putting approximately 87 killer whales on the British Columbia Coast in danger.|$|E
