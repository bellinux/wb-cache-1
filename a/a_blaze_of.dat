5|$|Agents raid Modell's apartment, {{but find}} it empty. They find cans of protein drinks in the {{refrigerator}} and medicine for epilepsy. Mulder suspects that a brain tumor has given Modell his psychokinetic ability, but that using his power is physically exhausting, forcing him to constantly consume the energy drinks. Mulder believes that he is dying and wants {{to go out in}} <b>a</b> <b>blaze</b> <b>of</b> glory. Modell makes a taunting phone call to Agent Burst and causes him to have a fatal heart attack while they try to trace him. The agents track Modell down to a hospital, where he has compelled a guard to shoot an MRI technician and kill himself. Mulder ventures inside the hospital and is captured by Modell.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} the compilers of these {{charters}} was to express their meaning {{by the use of}} the greatest possible number of words and by the choice of the most grandiloquent, bombastic words they could find. Every sentence is so overloaded by the heaping up of unnecessary words that the meaning is almost buried out of sight. The invocation with its appended clauses, opening with pompous and partly alliterative words, will proceed amongst <b>a</b> <b>blaze</b> <b>of</b> verbal fireworks throughout twenty lines of smallish type, and the pyrotechnic display will be maintained with equal magnificence throughout the whole charter, leaving the reader, dazzled by the glaze and blinded by the smoke, in a state of uncertainty as to the meaning of these frequently untranslatable and usually interminable sentences.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening night}} of the {{convention}} saw the keynote speech by Governor Stassen; he subsequently announced his support for Willkie {{and became one of}} the candidate's floor managers. The second night featured a speech by the only living former president, Herbert Hoover, who hoped to stampede the convention to a third nomination. His address went almost unheard in the hall because of problems with the sound system. In the meantime, the Dewey campaign, faced with the German announcement that with France taken, Hitler's forces would sail on Britain, did its best to stem the flow of delegates to Willkie. Negotiations among Dewey, Taft, and Vandenberg came to nothing because none would accept less than the presidential nomination. <b>A</b> <b>blaze</b> <b>of</b> publicity followed Willkie wherever he went, as he caucused with delegates and appeared at press conferences with supporters, including the entire Connecticut delegation. A strong minority of African Americans still supported the Republicans, and Willkie met with a group of them, urging those delegates to visit him in the White House in 1941.|$|E

25|$|Though born in {{a cattle}} pen to be a simple goatherd, Gendun Drup thus rose {{to become one of}} the most celebrated and {{respected}} teachers in Tibet and Central Asia. His spiritual accomplishments brought him lavish donations from devotees which he used to build and furnish new monasteries, to print and distribute Buddhist texts and to maintain monks and meditators. At last, at the age of 84, older than any of his 13 successors, in 1474 he went on foot to visit Narthang Monastery on a final teaching tour. Returning to Tashilhunpo he died 'in <b>a</b> <b>blaze</b> <b>of</b> glory, recognised as having attained Buddhahood'.|$|E

25|$|Knock Shrine, in County Mayo, Ireland, is {{the site}} of a nineteenth-century apparition. On the wet Thursday evening of 21 August 1879, at about 8 o'clock, Our Lady, St. Joseph, and St. John the Evangelist {{appeared}} in <b>a</b> <b>blaze</b> <b>of</b> Heavenly light at the south gable of Knock Parish Church. Behind them and a little to the left of St. John was a plain altar. On the altar was a cross and a lamb with adoring angels. The appearance of St Joseph, St John and the Lamb make the apparition unique in church history. The Apparition was seen by fifteen people whose ages ranged from six years to seventy-five and included men, women and children.|$|E
25|$|Marriage did not {{diminish}} Porter's taste for extravagant luxury. The Porter {{home on the}} rue Monsieur near Les Invalides was a palatial house with platinum wallpaper and chairs upholstered in zebra skin. In 1923, Porter came into an inheritance from his grandfather, and the Porters began living in rented palaces in Venice. He once hired the entire Ballets Russes to entertain his house guests, and for a party at Ca' Rezzonico, which he rented for $4,000 a month ($ in current value), he hired 50 gondoliers to act as footmen and had a troupe of tight-rope walkers perform in <b>a</b> <b>blaze</b> <b>of</b> lights. In {{the midst of this}} extravagant lifestyle, Porter continued to write songs with encouragement from his wife.|$|E
25|$|In {{the lower}} and middle {{parts of the}} slopes old and non-fertilised meadows with fruit trees offer <b>a</b> <b>blaze</b> <b>of</b> colour of {{different}} flowers. With their high trunks the fruit groves provide the optimal habitat for a diversity of small animals, birds, and plants. The wryneck {{is one of the}} typical inhabitants of these meadows, because they avoid bleak areas and dense forests. Just as important for the small animals, birds, and plants are the various hedges and shrubs, which can be found everywhere on and around Hesselberg. In our farmed landscape hedges have the largest variety of microhabitats. In addition to the groves there is a herb layer—rich in species—a sunny herb fringe, coarse woody debris, and possibly special biotopes, such as the piles of stones. Because of the transition from water-permeable to impermeable rock layers several spring horizons have emerged, explaining the richness of the springs. On Hesselberg there are several deep wells, but most springs appear in the form of flat swamps. The special flora and fauna of the wells is not immediately obvious, because most of the organisms are microscopic. Sundew is a very rare plant found in these wetlands.|$|E

[...] Alkan later played Beethoven's Op. 110 sonata, of which d'Indy said: [...] "What happened to the great Beethovenian poem... I couldn't begin to describe– above all in the Arioso and the Fugue, where the melody, penetrating the mystery of Death itself, climbs up to <b>a</b> <b>blaze</b> <b>of</b> light, affected me with an excess of enthusiasm such as I have never experienced since. This was not Liszt—perhaps less perfect, technically—but it had greater intimacy and was more humanly moving..." ...|$|E

Small Heath were decisive victors by three goals to nil, Hallam's wing play drawing particular praise, as did Jenkyns' [...] "admirable captaincy". The attendance was something over 8,000, of whom 6,800 paid on the day, generating gate receipts of £200. Although the result was rather overshadowed by Aston Villa beating Burnley away from home to be confirmed as First Division champions, the Dart clearly appreciated how Small Heath [...] "in <b>a</b> <b>blaze</b> <b>of</b> glory before the largest crowd ever seen at Coventry Road, gave the English Cup holders a licking".|$|E
500|$|The {{visual effects}} and slow-motion {{sequences}} induced by Slo-Mo received broad praise. Berkshire {{said that they}} are notable and eye-catching with [...] "impressively utilised 3d." [...] Hewitt said the visuals were [...] "genuinely surreal splashes of heightened colour that...don't outstay their welcome. The film's use of 3D is often excellent (including the credits) and it really comes {{to life in the}} Slo-mo scenes". Dalton said the film [...] "constantly impresses on a visual level, with a gritty style more akin to cult hits like District 9 or 28 Days Later than to standard Hollywood comic-book blockbusters." [...] Dalton said, [...] " [...] first venture into 3D is <b>a</b> <b>blaze</b> <b>of</b> saturated colours, gorgeous high-resolution close-ups and dazzling slow-motion sequences."

500|$|When writing music, Abbott and Darrell {{suggested}} guitar riffs and [...] "grooves", while Lachman {{added his}} input {{to modify the}} song's structure.

Christine Klunk of PopMatters disliked the similarities and commented, [...] "aside from a constant, driving rhythm, repetitive riffs, and unintelligible lyrics about (I'm assuming) kicking assthere's nothing of interest to pay attention to". The song [...] "Breathing New Life" [...] features 180 beats-per-minute bass drum pedaling, what Vik Bansal of MusicOMH described as [...] "exploding into <b>a</b> <b>blaze</b> <b>of</b> riffage and a cool chorus".

500|$|The Violin Concerto was Elgar's last popular triumph. The {{following}} year he presented his Second Symphony in London, but was disappointed at its reception. Unlike the First Symphony, it ends not in <b>a</b> <b>blaze</b> <b>of</b> orchestral splendour but quietly and contemplatively. Reed, {{who played at}} the premiere, later wrote that Elgar was recalled to the platform several times to acknowledge the applause, [...] "but missed that unmistakable note perceived when an audience, even an English audience, is thoroughly roused or worked up, as {{it was after the}} Violin Concerto or the First Symphony." [...] Elgar asked Reed, [...] "What is the matter with them, Billy? They sit there like a lot of stuffed pigs." [...] The work was, by normal standards, a success, with twenty-seven performances within three years of its premiere, but it did not achieve the international furore of the First Symphony.|$|E
500|$|During the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International, Kripke {{announced}} that Jo would {{return in the}} series' fifth season.

Jo {{was one of many}} deceased characters the writers considered to have appear in the alternate reality of the sixth season episode [...] "My Heart Will Go On", but they ultimately settled on Ellen.

500|$|The writers {{intended}} for the character to make only two guest appearances in the third season, which left Ferris [...] "a bit surprised and [...] " [...] at Ellen's lack of involvement.

The opportunity to return for the fifth season surprised her due to the large time span since her previous appearance.
