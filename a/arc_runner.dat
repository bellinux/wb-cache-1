50|$|CuW {{can also}} be used as a contact {{material}} in a vacuum. When the contact is very fine grained (VFG) the electrical conductivity is much higher than a normal piece of Copper Tungsten. Copper tungsten is a good choice for a vacuum contact due to its low cost, resistance to arc erosion, good conductivity, and resistance to mechanical wear and contact welding. CuW is usually a contact for vacuum, oil, and gas systems. It is not a good contact for air since the surface will oxidize when exposed. CuW is less likely to erode in air when the concentration of copper is higher in the material. The uses of CuW in the air are as an arc tip, arc plate, and an <b>arc</b> <b>runner.</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{integrated}} portable {{measurement system}} is presented {{for the study}} of high speed and high temperature unsteady plasma flows such as those found in the vicinity of high current switching arcs. The system permits direct and nonintrusive measurement of arc light emission images with a capture rate of 1 million images per second (1 MHz), and 8 bit intensity resolution. Novel software techniques are reported to visualise the arc motion and to measure arc trajectories. Results are presented on high current (2 kA) discharge events where the electrode and <b>arc</b> <b>runner</b> surfaces are investigated using optical surface scanning methods; such that the position of the arc roots on the runner can be correlated to the measured trajectories.

50|$|In Singapore, {{the main}} Wangan Midnight manga, along with C1 Runner volumes, has been {{translated}} by Chuang Yi into English for Singaporean readers. However, despite being translated into English, the manga series was never popular as its rival, Initial D (which {{was translated into}} Chinese by the same company). Even the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune series and the PS3 game {{of the same name}} did not help improving the sales of the manga. Despite this, the C1 <b>Runner</b> <b>arc</b> is currently translated into English as well.|$|R
50|$|The half {{marathon}} {{begins in}} George Square and immediately heads steeply up St. Vincent Street, going west through the city's commercial centre and Anderston. Runners then join a sliproad of the M8 motorway and cross the River Clyde on the Kingston Bridge, {{part of which}} is closed to vehicle traffic for the Sunday morning of the event. The next portion of the race {{takes place in the}} city's south side, heading through streets of the Kinning Park area, and then on paths through Bellahouston Park and heading back northeast toward Pacific Quay and the river. The course then crosses the Clyde again, this time on the Clyde <b>Arc.</b> From there <b>runners</b> head west along the river side, past the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre before doubling back around the Riverside Museum to head east along the Clyde, and back through Anderston, with runners entering Glasgow Green through the McLennan Arch for the finish.|$|R
40|$|Investigations {{have been}} made into {{the effect of the}} Miniature Circuit Breaker {{configuration}} on the behaviour of short circuit arcs. A Flexible Test Apparatus was developed to recreate the operation of a MCB, igniting the arc between opening contacts. The short circuit fault was simulated using a capacitor discharge system, with a prospective peak current of 3. 5 kA. A high-speed digital Arc Imaging System was used to record the arc behaviour. Analysis techniques have been developed that plot the individual trajectories of the anode and cathode root from the digital data. The time that each arc root remains in the contact region can be deduced and is defined as the arc root contact time. It is shown that the traditional arc voltage to measure arc contact times is not accurate. In the Arc Contact Time Investigation the contact material, contact geometry, <b>arc</b> <b>runner</b> configuration were varied. At 3 m/s contact velocity silver graphite contacts and step geometry led to longer cathode root contact times. Cathode root motion was prevented by a corner on the <b>arc</b> <b>runner.</b> The polarity of connection affected the arc movement away from the contact region. Increasing the contact velocity reduced cathode root contact times, but did not guarantee arc movement away from the contact region. The Taguchi Method was applied to the Arc Behaviour Investigation. The contact material, contact geometry, arc chamber geometry, arc chamber material and arc chamber venting were varied. Tests were carried out at lOm/s contact velocity. The cathode root contact time, anode root contact times and let through energy were calculated. The arc voltage and current, arc root trajectory plots and selected arc images are presented. The cathode and anode root contact times were independent. Generally, the cathode root moved away from the contact region before the anode root. Lower let-though energies were recorded for open arc chamber vents. The arc failed to move from the contact region, when silver graphite contacts were used in combination with acrylic arc chamber, copper arc runners and choked arc chamber vents. The mobility of the arc is dominated by the cathode root, and can only run at high velocity if the electrode surface conditions promote oxide layer type emission. The arc is drawn between the contacts with metal vapour type emission dominating and is initially limited to low velocity. During the arc contact time the arc root interaction effects damage the oxide layer on the surrounding conductor surface. As the arc column length increases, deflection of the arc column by the self-blast magnetic field may cause a discontinuous jump, after which the arc may run at high velocity. Increasing the contact velocity and steel <b>arc</b> <b>runner</b> backing strips encourage a discontinuous jump away from the contact region. Deposition on the <b>arc</b> <b>runner</b> of silver and carbon discourages both discontinuous jumps and high velocity motion. Changes in geometry, restricting the arc chamber venting and the anode root commutation can reduce the cathode root velocity. When this occurs, the arc root interaction effects damage the oxide layer, and cause the arc to revert to metal vapour type emission. Additionally, the surface of the acrylic arc chamber is carbonised during prolonged arc contact times. The partial conducting path through the carbonised material further encourages the arc to remain in the contact region...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a test system, {{designed for the}} investigation of short circuit arcs related to miniature circuit breakers operating in a 240 V, AC supply. An optical fiber imaging system is used to identify arc root motion, with short circuit current up to 6 kA. Two methods are used to measure contact motion, a noncontact linear position sensor, and the optical fiber array. The optical fiber array uses software image processing to identify {{the position of the}} arc roots in the arc chamber. The identification of the arc roots allows for a study of the arc immobility at the initial stages of the event.
