50|$|An <b>availability</b> <b>plan</b> should clearly {{provide a}} {{strategy}} for availability control. Whether only Availability or also Cost of Ownership is more important depends {{on the use of}} the system. For example, a system that is a critical link in a production system - e.g. a big oil platform - is normally allowed to have a very high cost of ownership if this translates to even a minor increase in availability, as the unavailability of the platform results in a massive loss of revenue which can easily exceed the high cost of ownership. A proper reliability plan should always address RAMT analysis in its total context. RAMT stands in this case for Reliability, Availability, Maintainability/Maintenance and Testability in context to the customer needs.|$|E
50|$|Reliability {{needs to}} be {{evaluated}} and improved related to both availability {{and the cost of}} ownership (due to cost of spare parts, maintenance man-hours, transport costs, storage cost, part obsolete risks etc.). Often a trade-off is needed between the two. There might be a maximum ratio between availability and cost of ownership. Testability of a system should also be addressed in the <b>availability</b> <b>plan</b> as this is the link between reliability and maintainability. The maintenance strategy can influence the reliability of a system (e.g. by preventive and/or predictive maintenance), although it can never bring it above the inherent reliability. So, Maintainability and Maintenance strategies influences the availability of a system. In theory this can be almost unlimited if one would be able to always repair any fault in an infinitely short time. This is in practice impossible. Repair-ability is always limited due to testability, manpower and logistic considerations. Reliability is not limited (Reliable items can be made that outlast the life of a machine with almost 100% certainty). For high levels of system availability (e.g. the availability of engine trust in an aircraft), the use of redundancy may be the only option. Refer to reliability engineering.|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Naval Shipyards’ {{schedules}} {{revolve around}} the planning and execution of Naval vessel “availabilities,” essential maintenance periods during {{the life of a}} vessel with the purpose of maintaining and improving the operational readiness and its fighting ability. Because of the high operational tempo for Naval vessels today, the four public Naval shipyards are continually challenged to complete depot-level availabilities on schedule. In order to support the completion of availabilities in a timely manner, this article presents a summary of execution delays (known as work stoppages), and an analysis on the impact of work stoppages during the execution phase. The work stoppage data are summarized to display possible trends based on the mean length and quantity of work stoppages across multiple availabilities, and possible predictors of availability lateness using a timed based metric are further investigated. The analysis of the data suggests that although no simple association exist between the quantity or length of work stoppage and the lateness of an availability, availabilities that finish on schedule tend to have had fewer work stoppages {{before the start of the}} availability as compared to the later finishing availabilities, signifying the importance of a complete and thoroughly supported <b>availability</b> <b>plan.</b> This study assists the Naval shipyard leadership in understanding a contributing factor to availability lateness, and can be applied to the shipyard maintenance community in which delays are experienced throughout a project...|$|E

40|$|The {{availability}} of an organisation’s IT infrastructure is of vital importance for supporting business activities. IT outages are {{a cause of}} competitive liability, chipping away at a company financial performance and reputation. To achieve the maximum possible IT availability within the available budget, organisations need {{to carry out a}} set of analysis activities to prioritise efforts and take decisions based on the business needs. This set of analysis activities is called IT <b>availability</b> <b>planning.</b> Most (large) organisations address IT <b>availability</b> <b>planning</b> from {{one or more of the}} three main angles: information risk management, business continuity and service level management. Information risk management consists of identifying, analysing, evaluating and mitigating the risks that can affect the information processed by an organisation and the information-processing (IT) systems. Business continuity consists of creating a logistic plan, called business continuity plan, which contains the procedures and all the useful information needed to recover an organisations’ critical processes after major disruption. Service level management mainly consists of organising, documenting and ensuring a certain quality level (e. g. the availability level) for the services offered by IT systems to the business units of an organisation. There exist several standard documents that provide the guidelines to set up the processes of risk, business continuity and service level management. However, to be as generally applicable as possible, these standards do not include implementation details. Consequently, to do IT <b>availability</b> <b>planning</b> each organisation needs to develop the concrete techniques that suit its needs. To be of practical use, these techniques must be accurate enough to deal with the increasing complexity of IT infrastructures, but remain feasible within the budget available to organisations. As we argue in this dissertation, basic approaches currently adopted by organisations are feasible but often lack of accuracy. In this thesis we propose a graph-based framework for modelling the availability dependencies of the components of an IT infrastructure and we develop techniques based on this framework to support <b>availability</b> <b>planning.</b> In more detail we present: 1. the Time Dependency model, which is meant to support IT managers in the selection of a cost-optimal set of countermeasures to mitigate availability-related IT risks; 2. the Qualitative Time Dependency model, which is meant to be used to systematically assess availability-related IT risks in combination with existing risk assessment methods; 3. the Time Dependency and Recovery model, which provides a tool for IT managers to set or validate the recovery time objectives on the components of an IT architecture, which are then used to create the IT-related part of a business continuity plan; 4. A 2 THOS, to verify if availability SLAs, regulating the provisioning of IT services between business units of the same organisation, can be respected when the implementation of these services is partially outsourced to external companies, and to choose outsourcing offers accordingly. We run case studies with the data of a primary insurance company and a large multinational company to test the proposed techniques. The results indicate that organisations such as insurance or manufacturing companies, which use IT to support their business can benefit from the optimisation of the {{availability of}} their IT infrastructure: it is possible to develop techniques that support IT <b>availability</b> <b>planning</b> while guaranteeing feasibility within budget. The framework we propose shows that the structure of the IT architecture can be practically employed with such techniques to increase their accuracy over current practice...|$|R
40|$|The {{intermittent}} {{nature of}} renewable energy sources (RESs) and unpredictable load demands are two major challenges in providing uninterrupted power supply from a smart grid. One way to address these challenges is to use storage devices that can store surplus energy from RESs and discharge the energy back to the grid when needed. Researchers have recently introduced the idea to use electric vehicles with vehicle-to-grid capability, which are called “gridable vehicles” (GVs), as storage devices in the smart grid. Using GVs as loads is well accepted, but as sources, they disrupt system reliability if insufficient GVs are available for discharging when needed. An <b>availability</b> <b>planning</b> model is thus required to address this issue. GV owners’ concern over battery lifetime reductions is another issue that impedes the required participation rates for GVs in vehicle-to-grid discharge programs. In this paper, we present an intelligent smart grid system model, which mitigates real-time unavailability of GV sources via an <b>availability</b> <b>planning</b> model. We also propose a GV selection model that prevents GV batteries from premature expiry due to their vehicle-to-grid operations. Simulation results confirm that our proposed models maintain better overall reliability and increase average battery lifetime by up to 3. 5 years compared with existing vehicle-to-grid models...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the single machine {{scheduling}} problem, with sequence dependent setup times. Both processing and setup times are deterministic and {{the objective is to}} minimize total earliness and tardiness penalties. The novelty of the model can be traced {{in the fact that the}} single machine is subjected to breakdowns and that, in order to increase its <b>availability,</b> <b>planned</b> maintenance tasks are also performed. Hence, jobs and maintenance tasks are jointly considered to find the optimal schedule. These features make the problem NP-hard and so, a quasi-optimal solution is searched using a recent metaheuristic, which integrates harmony search and genetic algorithms. In order to validate the proposed metaheuristic, a comprehensive set of scheduling problems was fully investigated. Obtained results, compared with those of exhaustive (for small problems) and standard metaheuristics, confirm both the robustness and the speed of the proposed approach...|$|R

As a consequence, suitable penetration loss models are of significant importance for service <b>availability</b> <b>planning.</b> Standard penetration loss models ignore the building layout {{in relation to}} the transmitter-receiver geometry. Within this paper, we introduce the term entry loss as a measure for the additional loss of a wideband impulse received at the geometrical line-of- sight path delay caused by the building materials. Knowing the received power caused by indoor multipath propagation, the penetration loss and the entry loss are deterministically related. As a contribution, we propose an entry loss model which is able to include the geometrical relation of walls, receiver and transmitter positions. Within the model, we treat walls, windows and doors as apertures and, therefore, as sources for signal penetration and diffraction. A verification of the model using wideband channel sounder measurement data is performed. By simulations, we show the comparability between existing models and the proposed one. Moreover, a short description on the usage of the proposed entry loss model for wideband channel simulations is provided...|$|R

30|$|Due to {{the fact}} that there are {{increasing}} demand, limited resources, water table variation in space and time, as well as soil contamination, it is required to manage available water resources at farm level optimally (Kumar and Singh 2003). A very important element in successful operation and management of irrigation schemes is efficient water management. It means by irrigation water management is determining when to irrigate, the amount of water to use at each irrigation stage and during each stage of plant, also operating and maintaining the irrigation system. The main purpose of management system is to manage the production system for profit without compromising the environment so that the management is also in agreement with water <b>availability</b> <b>plans.</b> A major concern in management programs is to identify when and how much water to apply or irrigation scheduling on the other words. In this regard, the irrigation method and other field characteristics must be considered carefully (Holzapfel et al. 2009).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} improve availability by testing redundant parts at pre-determined intervals. The purpose of the testing is to detect nonfunctional back-up equipment and develop work-around measures or replacement spacecraft before {{a failure of the}} primary equipment reduces availability. The work reported here is an outgrowth of the NASA Space Network's program for the maintenance and replenishment of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System. The approach is based on a standby factor and a cyclic stress factor. The standby factor accounts for the effects of adverse storage conditions encountered as part of the in-flight environment. The stress factor accounts for the effects of physical or thermal cycling due to the application of force or power that characterizes the operation or use of a component. By the quantitative consideration of standby and cycling risks, a regular testing interval can be calculated - an interval for testing that furnishes information for <b>availability</b> <b>planning</b> but does not subject the spacecraft to undue risk. This paper includes quantitative solutions for appropriate testing intervals for equipment configurations and failure rates that are representative of a Tracking and Relay Data Satellite.
