40|$|Access {{to health}} care is a complex issue with {{multiple}} supply and demand side facets. Here just two issues are explored; the potential for access through availability and the actual access made as indicated by utilisation rates. These perspectives are explored for two mental health services, crisis resolution teams and day hospitals, both of which are recommended components for a comprehensive local mental health care service in England. The geographical spread of these services is considered alongside the level of provision and the extent of their use. Associations between availability and needs, and between use and needs are tested. Tracking resources from funding <b>allocations</b> <b>to</b> <b>provision</b> is also complex and issues around resource allocation are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Voice Over IP (VoIP) {{has been}} one of the {{fastest-growing}} application in the Internet today. Hi. -h-quality IP telephony services require stringent bounds on several quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, especially on bandwidth and end-to-end delay. In order to provide such services, network engineers need tools for capacity planning, which often involves QoS routing for each communication request stemmed from the services. However, it has been proven that the allocation of each single demand with multiple QoS criteria is NP-complete. This paper approaches the problem by extending the Blocking Island heuristic [7], which has been proven very efficient for solving the bandwidth <b>allocation</b> problem, <b>to</b> <b>provision</b> for both bandwidth and delay requirements in the context of VoIP...|$|R

This paper argues that existing research {{does not provide}} the required factual basis for such an approach, yielding conclusions that are either inconclusive or inconsistent in crucial areas, because {{it tends to be}} aimed at exploring pathology not social processes. We conclude that a better research agenda must be based on studies that explore gambling in its social and economic context...|$|R
40|$|The key task in {{the next}} stage of {{spectrum}} management is to adapt regulation to the prospect of widespread sharing, on a much more sophisticated basis than that phrase is used today. There is a role for the regulator to take steps to expand the area of choice within which public and private sector users can operate. This is best done in general by enhancing the flexibility of usage rights, which itself is best achieved by enhancing the freedom to trade them in the dimensions of time, space, level of interference and priority of access, by subdividing, re-aggregating etc. However, there are considerable 'transactions cost' impediments to trading where unlicensed users are involved. This creates a role for the regulator pro-actively <b>to</b> investigate different <b>allocations,</b> <b>to</b> make <b>provisions</b> for the most promising to occur and to incorporate in refarming exercises and in primary assignments based on auctions configurations of usage rights which might favour promising avenues of spectrum use...|$|R
40|$|Due to an {{overlap in}} the {{resources}} {{used by the}} flight muscles with the resources used during egg production, {{it has been hypothesised}} that an increased dispersal in fragmented landscapes may result in a physiological trade-off between flight and reproduction. In a common garden experiment, we investigated the effects of increased flight on the reproductive output of female speckled wood butterflies (Pararge aegeria, L.) from closed continuous woodland populations versus open highly fragmented agricultural landscapes in central France. Our flight treatment significantly affected resource <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> egg size, but had no effect on mean daily fecundity. This treatment effect was similar for females from the two landscapes of origin, and suggests that energetic costs associated with increased flight result in a decrease in resource <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> egg <b>provisioning.</b> There was a landscape-specific effect of flight on longevity: flight reduced longevity by 21 % in woodland females, but had no affect on agricultural females. This result suggests that woodland landscape females further compensate for excessive flight by redirecting resources away from somatic maintenance, resulting in reduced life spans. Our results strongly indicate that increased flight caused by changes in landscape structure may impact on key life history traits such as reproductive success and longevity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Cloud systems require elastic {{resource}} <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> minimize resource <b>provisioning</b> costs while meeting {{service level}} objectives (SLOs). In this paper, {{we present a}} novel PRedictive Elastic reSource Scaling (PRESS) scheme for cloud systems. PRESS unobtrusively extracts fine-grained dynamic patterns in application resource demands and adjust their resource allocations automatically. Our approach leverages light-weight signal processing and statistical learning algorithms to achieve online predictions of dynamic application resource requirements. We have implemented the PRESS system on Xen and tested it using RUBiS and an application load trace from Google. Our experiments show that our light-weight resource demand prediction schemes can achieve better resource prediction accuracy with both lower over-estimation and under-estimation errors than previous approaches. Our elastic resource scaling can effectively reduce both resource waste and SLO violations. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In current {{multi-channel}} live P 2 P video systems, {{there are}} several fundamental performance problems including exceedingly-large channel switching delays, long playback lags, and poor performance for less popular channels. These performance problems primarily stem from two intrinsic characteristics of multi-channel P 2 P video systems: channel churn and channelresource imbalance. In this paper, we propose a radically different cross-channel P 2 P streaming framework, called View-Upload Decoupling (VUD). VUD strictly decouples peer downloading from uploading, bringing stability to multichannel systems and enabling cross-channel resource sharing. We propose a set of peer assignment and bandwidth <b>allocation</b> algorithms <b>to</b> properly <b>provision</b> bandwidth among channels, and introduce substream swarming to reduce the bandwidth overhead. We evaluate the performance of VUD via extensive simulations as well with a PlanetLab implementation. Our simulation and PlanetLab results show that VUD is resilient to channel churn, and achieves lower switching delay and better streaming quality. In particular, the streaming quality of small channels is greatly improved. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Heterogeneous {{wireless}} networks provide {{varying degrees}} of network coverage in a multi-tier configuration in which low-powered small cells are used to enhance performance. Due to the ad-hoc deployment of small cells, optimal resource <b>allocation</b> is important <b>to</b> <b>provision</b> fairness and enhance energy efficiency. We first study the worst outage probability problem in Rayleigh-fading channels, and solve this nonconvex stochastic pro-gram using mathematical tools from nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory. As a by-product, we solve an open problem of convergence for a previously proposed algorithm in the interference-limited case. We then address a total power minimization problem with outage specification constraints and its feasibility issue. We pro-pose a dynamic algorithm that adapts the outage probability specification in a heterogeneous wireless network to minimize the total energy consumption and to simultaneously provide fairness guarantees {{in terms of the}} worst outage probability. Finally, we provide numerical evaluation on the performance of the algorithms and the effectiveness of deploying closed-access small cells in heterogeneous wireless networks to address the tradeoff between energy saving and feasibility of users satisfying their outage probability specifications.

40|$|Charging station {{location}} decisions are a critical element in mainstream adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). The consumer confidence in EVs can be boosted with {{the deployment of}} carefully-planned charging infrastructure that can fuel {{a fair number of}} trips. The charging station (CS) location problem is complex and differs considerably from the classical facility location literature, as the decision parameters are additionally linked to a relatively longer charging period, battery parameters, and available grid resources. In this study, we propose a three-layered system model of fast charging stations (FCSs). In the first layer, we solve the flow capturing location problem to identify the locations of the charging stations. In the second layer, we use a queuing model and introduce a resource <b>allocation</b> framework <b>to</b> optimally <b>provision</b> the limited grid resources. In the third layer, we consider the battery charging dynamics and develop a station policy to maximize the profit by setting maximum charging levels. The model is evaluated on the Arizona state highway system and North Dakota state network with a gravity data model, and on the City of Raleigh, North Carolina, using real traffic data. The results show that the proposed hierarchical model improves the system performance, as well as the quality of service (QoS), provided to the customers. The proposed model can efficiently assist city planners for CS location selection and system design...|$|R

40|$|In resource-poor environments, {{adjustment}} in plant biomass allocation implies a complex interplay between environmental signals and plant development {{rather than a}} delay in plant development alone. To understand how environmental factors influence biomass allocation or the developing phenotype, {{it is necessary to}} distinguish the biomass allocations resulting from environmental gradients or ontogenetic drift. Here, we compared the development trajectories of cotton plants (Gossypium herbaceum L.), which were grown in two contrasting soil textures during a 60 -d period. Those results distinguished the biomass allocation pattern resulting from ontogenetic drift and the response to soil texture. The soil texture significantly changed the biomass <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> leaves and roots, but not to stems. Soil texture also significantly changed the development trajectories of leaf and root traits, but did not change the scaling relationship between basal stem diameter and plant height. Results of nested ANOVAs of consecutive plant-size categories in both soil textures showed that soil gradients explained an average of 63. 64 - 70. 49 % of the variation of biomass <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> leaves and roots. Ontogenetic drift explained 77. 47 % of the variation in biomass <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> stems. The results suggested that the environmental factors governed the biomass <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> roots and leaves, and ontogenetic drift governed the biomass <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> stems. The results demonstrated that biomass <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> metabolically active organs (e. g., roots and leaves) was mainly governed by environmental factors, and that biomass <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> metabolically non-active organs (e. g., stems) was mainly governed by ontogenetic drift.
