40|$|In this thesis, an {{investigation}} is described to the measured horizontal displacements of a quay {{wall in the}} Port of Rotterdam. This quay wall was built in 2003 to replace an existing jetty. A combined tubular wall was installed {{and some of the}} concrete jetty piles were reused as foundation piles for the relieving platform. Anchorage for the quay wall is provided by an eight meter high continuous <b>anchor</b> <b>wall,</b> 38 meter behind the quay wall made of steel sheet piles. The connection between the two walls consists of high strength steel presetressed strands. Prior to describing the actual research in this report, measurements are considered that have been carried out over time on top of the quay wall. These measurements indicate that horizontal displacements increase nonlinearly in time. This trend was the reason for {{an investigation}} to all possible causes of the horizontal displacements of the combi wall. In this thesis, the research is discussed and possible causes of the measurements are revealed by considering one representative cross section of the largest part of the quay wall. The main part of this thesis deals with the investigation for possible causes of the measurements and is elaborated by considering the different influences for the representative cross section. Firstly, time dependent soil behaviour is examined. The Koppejan formula and the finite element method are used to determine the influences of consolidation and creep. Due to counteracting prestressing and gravity forces the effects in time due to consolidation and creep seems to be negligible. Secondly, the capacity of the <b>anchor</b> <b>wall</b> is investigated based on Coulomb’s theory and the finite element method. Due to a proven densification of the passive soil wedge, the capacity appeared to be sufficient. Subsequently, macro stability of the soil body between the anchor and combined wall (Kranz stability) is considered. Stability is proven to be sufficient by performing a hand calculation for the drained and undrained situation, followed by a verification calculation with a program based on the sub grade reaction method. Another considered possible cause is the difference in interpretation of the soil profile used in this report and the one used in the design. Therefore, a parametric study for the soil parameters is performed with the sub grade reaction method. These calculations show that the design profile resulted in larger deformations than a soil profile with expected values. Furthermore, it was decided to investigate the influence of the position and magnitude of a surcharge load. When the design load of 50 kN/m 2 is applied near the <b>anchor</b> <b>wall,</b> it was concluded from calculations that horizontal displacements are almost equal to the measurements. When a higher load is applied at positions further away from the <b>anchor</b> <b>wall,</b> again horizontal displacements appeared to be close to the measured displacements. Both the position and magnitude of loading are described as possible explanations for the measured deformations. Finally, it is concluded that saving money in the design stage by applying an <b>anchor</b> <b>wall,</b> resulted in more deformations than expected and made them dependent on the position of loading. Additionally, it is concluded that applying a higher load than was agreed upon in the terms of reference, resulted in more deformations than expected as well.

We calculate the horizontal displacement of the dock walls and compare {{the results of the}} displacement between two different working conditions in an actual dock. When the backfill soil is cohesive soil, the horizontal displacement is larger; and medium sand, displacement smaller. We analyze the internal forces of the walls and the anchors in two conditions, and compare mechanical response. The results show that the backfill soil is the main affection of the horizontal displacement.

40|$|This {{case history}} {{presents}} {{an application of}} Dynamic Compaction of the soil layers susceptible to liquefaction behind the main container quay wall of Shahid Rajaee Port Complex Development (SRPCD), situated on shores of Persian Golf near Bandar-Abbas. The liquefaction of such layers during earthquake results in the great lateral earth pressure {{as well as the}} settlement and large horizontal deformation of the main wall and <b>anchor</b> <b>wall.</b> Regarding the extension and the depth of the identified liquefiable layers, the improvement method of dynamic compaction was employed to mitigate the liquefaction destructive effect. Generally, the subsoil liquefiable layers of the SRPCD site consisted of reclaimed layers of silty sand with the maximum depths of 7 to 12 meters and the fine content of 20 % – 40 %. The preliminary compaction patterns were obtained using the energy-based method and the available empirical relationships based on the depth of influence and the required improving energy. Considering the previously conducted researches, the effectiveness of dynamic compaction and the applied energy to subsoil collapsible layers deteriorates due to the presence of fine content. Therefore, the effective influence depth of soil that is affected by this method of improvement is reduced. The effectiveness of the employed dynamic compaction patterns for different parts behind the main quay wall and <b>anchor</b> <b>wall</b> is evaluated comparing the results of pre and post-CPT tests (cone penetration tests performed before and after the compaction) with the criterion. Such criterion is defined as the liquefaction threshold resistance of the soil layers that is obtained using the most recent and distinguished CPT based liquefaction evaluation method. In case the criterion is not satisfied using CPT test results, the patter...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} several years, {{considerable}} {{attention has been given}} to the ultimate horizontal pull-out resistance of vertical deadman anchors, which are usually used together with earth retaining wall. Unfortunately, no significant effort has been made to understand/study the behaviour of discrete deadman anchor in earth retaining <b>wall</b> (<b>anchored</b> <b>wall)</b> subjected to the deflection of earth retaining wall. Therefore, this research aims to fill up this gap. The study on the behaviour of single-plate discrete deadman <b>anchor</b> in <b>anchored</b> <b>wall</b> subjected to the deflection of earth retaining wall is carried out by three-dimensional (3 -D) finite element analysis adopting finite element software named PLAXIS. The behaviour of discrete deadman anchor is studied by investigating the effects of several key factors. These include the effects of length of tie rod, embedment depth of anchor, spacing between deadman anchors, friction angle of soil, depth of <b>anchored</b> <b>wall,</b> and stiffness of <b>anchored</b> <b>wall.</b> Practicing geotechnical engineers are able to understand the interactions among soil-anchor-wall by studying the effects of several key factors on the behaviour of discrete deadman anchor. This allows practicing geotechnical engineers to determine the potential failure mechanisms and hence provide the most suitable design of <b>anchored</b> <b>wall</b> in geotechnical engineering. Furthermore, the effects of abovementioned key factors are summarised and design charts are proposed for the preliminary design of <b>anchored</b> <b>wall.</b> The design charts are developed based on limiting the wall deflection to 0. 5...|$|R

40|$|The suction anchor is an {{effective}} option for the anchor foundations of floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs). During its long-term service, {{in addition to the}} static pretension load, the suction anchor is subjected to a series of cyclic loads that are caused by waves, currents and the continuous motions of the floating structure. Thus, excess pore-pressure will accumulate within the soil around the embedded anchor, and the anchor capacity tends to be reduced. In this paper, by introducing the oscillatory and residual mechanisms, a novel numerical model is proposed to predict the instantaneous variations and accumulations of excess pore-pressures around a suction anchor that is subjected to long-term vertical cyclic loads. The results indicate that excess pore-pressure builds up mainly in the shallow soil near the external <b>anchor</b> <b>wall.</b> As a consequence, the effective soil stress in this region decreases along with the interface friction between the external wall and the soil. Detailed parametric studies reveal that the accumulation of excess pore-pressure is obvious for a larger load magnitude and smaller load period. With a lower permeability, smaller shear modulus or smaller relative density of the seabed soil, the pore-pressure accumulation outside the anchor increases significantly. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Ventspil Free Port Authority has {{commissioned}} {{the design of}} a new berth capable of hosting post Panamax vessels and having a retaining height of 18. 5 m. In proximity of the quay wall two sewage pipes lay {{on the bottom of the}} Venta River’s bed, which need to be combined into one single conduit with a diameter of 900 mm. In proximity of the quay wall the already existing movable Bridge on the River Venta is positioned perpendicularly to the quay wall’s center line. The final project is composed mostly of three parts: the design of the berth and of the pipeline, the analysis of the interaction between the quay wall and the conduit, the analysis of the interaction between the quay wall and the bridge’s foundation. Chapters 2, reports all boundary conditions such as water and ground levels, design vessels, hydraulic and morphological conditions, topographic and meteorological boundaries. Chapter 3 deals with the soil interpretation procedure, showing different available methods and adopted ones. The soil parameters such as angle of internal friction, dry and saturated weight and soil stiffness are obtained. Chapter 4 and 5, present different types of quay walls such as gravity walls, piles quay walls and open berth structures. By performing a Multi Criteria Analysis a choice of the most suitable berth is obtained. Chapter 6 - 8, deal with the load analysis of the quay wall. In particular chapter 6 deals with the estimation of the quay wall’s foundation reaction forces due to loads such as the concrete weight, soil weight, traffic and cargo yard load, crane, fender and ice load. Chapter 7 analyzes in particular the spreading pattern of the movable crane load on the quay wall. Chapter 8 considers the load combination on the quay wall. The design of the foundation elements of the quay wall such as the steel Combi-wall and the concrete bearing piles is performed according to different methods in chapter 9 and 10. The most suitable and most conservative one is found to be the Koppejan method. Negative skin friction effects are also included in the design of the bearing piles. The design of the Combi-wall is determined by adopting Blum’s method of fixed point. Chapter 11 deals with the design of the <b>anchor</b> <b>wall</b> and of the anchor rods. Chapter 12 estimates the construction costs of the quay wall, which amount to ca. 30. 000 Euros per running meter. The overall stability of the quay wall is determined by adopting a 2 D Plaxis model of the berth as reported in Chapter 13. Chapter 14 deals with the design of the pipeline and interaction between the quay wall’s foundation elements and the pipe. By means of a 2 D Plaxis analysis, the soil stress increment on the pile is determined. The effects of the quay wall’s deformations on the pipe are found to generate an increase of soil stresses around the pipe’s shell of ca. 25 KPa. Least but not last the interaction between the quay wall and the Bridge’s foundation is determined. The Bridge’s foundation is in fact influenced by the deformation of the quay wall and by the dredging of the pocket in front of the quay wall. Analysis is performed by using Plaxis 3 D. Results show negligible or small effects on the Bridge’s foundation in the order of 1 cm displacement of the Bridge’s foundation. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
