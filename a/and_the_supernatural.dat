5|$|The French Revolution (17891799) brought {{sweeping}} changes to theatre in France. Banished were the ballets the aristocracy preferred about {{the gods and}} goddesses of Mount Olympus. Instead, ballets about everyday people, real places, real time, the historical past, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatural</b> took prominence. These sorts of ballets were preferred by the burgeoning middle class.|$|E

5|$|Leaders' ideological {{power was}} based on {{apparent}} access to deities <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatural.</b> Evidence regarding Norte Chico religion is limited: {{an image of the}} Staff God, a leering figure with a hood and fangs, has been found on a gourd dated to 2250 BC. The Staff God is a major deity of later Andean cultures, and Winifred Creamer suggests the find points to worship of common symbols of gods. As with much other research at Norte Chico, the nature and significance of the find has been disputed by other researchers.|$|E

5|$|Shen Kuo wrote {{several other}} books besides the Dream Pool Essays, yet {{much of the}} writing in his other books has not survived. Some of Shen's poetry was {{preserved}} in posthumous written works. Although much of his focus was on technical and scientific issues, he {{had an interest in}} divination <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatural,</b> the latter including his vivid description of unidentified flying objects from eyewitness testimony. He also wrote commentary on ancient Daoist and Confucian texts.|$|E
5|$|When he {{developed}} his scheme for organizing {{all of his}} novels and stories into a single sequence called La Comédie humaine, Balzac placed La Peau de chagrin {{at the start of}} the section called Études philosophiques ("Philosophical Studies"). Like the other works in this category– including the similarly autobiographical Louis Lambert (1832)– it deals with philosophy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatural.</b> But it also provides a bridge to the realism of the Études des mœurs ("Study of Manners"), where the majority of his novels were located.|$|E

40|$|Declining {{belief in}} God and {{increasing}} belief in <b>the</b> <b>supernatural?</b> Trends between 1979 and 2000 explained Religion is gradually losing its influence in Dutch society, {{which is one}} aspect of ‘secularization’. In this study we focus on individual secularization, namely {{the increasing number of}} non-religious people in the Netherlands. More specifically, traditional Christian faith <b>and</b> belief in <b>the</b> <b>supernatural</b> are examined. First, the trends in these forms of belief are described for the period 1979 - 2000. Second, explanations for the trends are formulated and tested using OLS regression analyses accompanied by a simulation technique. During the 1979 - 2000 period, both traditional Christian faith <b>and</b> belief in <b>the</b> <b>supernatural</b> declined. <b>The</b> decline of Christian belief <b>and</b> belief in <b>the</b> <b>supernatural</b> is mainly caused by compositional effects, namely the slow but continuous replacement of older religious cohorts by younger non-religious cohorts. ...|$|R

5|$|The graphic {{novel was}} the first Batman story to be written by Morrison before {{becoming}} a regular writer in future Batman titles. Inspired by previous works like The Dark Knight Returns, Morrison conceived the story to be his own different approach to the character, using heavy symbolical references and the deconstruction of many iconic Batman villains. The story follows the vigilante Batman, who is called upon to quell a maddening riot {{taking place in the}} infamous Arkham Asylum, a psychiatric hospital housing the most dangerous supervillains in Gotham City. Inside, Batman confronts many of his enduring rogues gallery, such as the Joker, Two-Face, and Killer Croc, many of them having changed since he last saw them. As Batman ventures deeper, he discovers the origin of how the asylum was established, the history of its builder Amadeus Arkham, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatural</b> and psychological mystery that has been haunting the area.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the rest of Mesoamerica, the Maya {{believed}} in a supernatural realm inhabited by an array of powerful deities. These deities needed to be placated with ceremonial offerings and ritual practices. At the core of Maya religious practice was the worship of deceased ancestors, who would act as go-betweens for their living descendants in dealings with the denizens of the supernatural realm. The earliest intermediaries between humans <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatural</b> realm were shamans. Maya ritual included the use of hallucinogens for chilan (oracular) priests. Visions for the chilan were likely facilitated by consumption of water lilies, which are hallucinogenic in high doses. As the Maya civilization developed, the ruling elite codified the general concepts held by Maya society, and developed them into religious cults that justified their right to rule. In the Late Preclassic, the pinnacle of this process was the combination of ultimate political and religious power in the divine king, the k'uhul ajaw. Although it is difficult to reconstruct the belief system through archaeology, some indicators of ritual practice do leave physical traces. These include dedicatory caches and other ritual deposits, shrines, and burials and their associated funerary offerings. In addition, Maya art, architecture, and writing all assist in the reconstruction of ancient Maya beliefs; these can be combined with ethnographic sources, including records of Maya religious practices made by the Spanish during the conquest.|$|E

25|$|The discs {{gripped by}} some chacmools may {{represent}} a mirror. Chacmools were placed in entrances {{in order to receive}} sacrificial offerings, including human blood and hearts.
