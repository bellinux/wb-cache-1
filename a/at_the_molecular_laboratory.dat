40|$|The {{occurrence}} of tick-borne pathogens in dogs on communal land in Botswana was studied using Reverse Line Blot (RLB). Eighty blood {{samples were collected}} from dogs that underwent a spay and neuter program in Maun, Botswana. These {{were sent to the}} Department of Veterinary Tropical Diseases, University of Pretoria, and were stored <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Molecular</b> <b>Laboratory.</b> DNA was extracted from the samples followed by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and the RLB. Six samples were found to be positive for Ehrlichia canis. Two of the samples were positive for a concurrent infection of E. canis and Ehrlichia ruminantium. There was one sample that was positive for the non-pathogenic Ehrlichia sp. Omatjenne. Although six samples were positive for the Babesia/Theileria catch-all probe, none hybridised with any of the species-specific probes. CopyrightDissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.

40|$|Azathioprine is an {{immunosuppressive}} medication used in {{the treatment}} of inflammatory diseases (MICI). Despite its extensive use in therapy, azathioprine can result in serious side effects such as myelosuppression. The likelihood of developing myelosuppression also depends on genetic factors: one of the enzymes involved in drug metabolism, methyltransferase tiopurine (TPMT), is subject to genomic polymorphism. To date, 40 polymorphisms have been identified, of which three are associated with a reduction in enzymatic activity. These are TPMT* 2, TPMT* 3 A and TPMT* 3 C polymorphisms. TPMT* 1 is the wild-type coding form for an enzyme capable of efficiently metabolizing the drug. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine the frequency of the three polymorphisms in a sample undergoing a TPMT genotype assay <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Molecular</b> <b>Laboratory</b> of the “V. Cervello” hospital in Palermo. The test is carried out using DNA extraction procedures, PCRs, agarose gel electrophoresis and enzymatic digestion.

40|$|Yellow berry of Arabica coffee (AGK- 1) {{cultivated}} in Garut {{is a local}} cultivar that potentially could be released as a superior variety. However, its genetic background has not been studied. Information of genetic background {{is one of the}} requirement in releasing of a new variety. The objective of this research was to analyze the genetic relationships of AGK- 1 cultivar with 11 red berries Arabica coffee cultivars based on simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers to find polymorphisms and clustering. The research was carried out <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Molecular</b> <b>Laboratory</b> of Indonesian Industrial and Beverage Crops Research Institute and Biology Molecular Laboratory of Indonesian Center for Agricultural Biotechnology and Genetic Resources Research and Development, from January to March 2015. These twelve Arabica coffee cultivars were obtained from Garut Regency. A total of 12 SSR primers were used to investigate the genetic relationships of the plant. The result showed that 12 SSR markers were adequate to identify the relationships among 12 Arabica coffee cultivars. The genetic clustering obtained in this study is related to plant morphology, particularly plant growth characters, such as tall, semi dwarf and dwarf. AGK- 1 cultivar genetically related to ABP- 2, one of red berries cultivars that originated from Brazil. Both of these cultivars have the same growing type characters (i. e. semi dwarf). AGK- 1 cultivar that has yellow berry color presumably derived from an open pollinated red berries parents, mainly ABP- 2 cultivar. Therefore, AGK- 1 is a unique cultivar that could be released as a local superior variety...|$|E
