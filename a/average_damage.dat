5000|$|Alongside [...] "classic" [...] spells, charms, illusions, black magick, {{there is}} a special class of magic, Basic Magick (BM) dealing with spells {{manipulating}} the four elements (water, air, fire, earth) and their derivatives (ice, cold, heat, light, dark, sand, dust, rain, etc..) All sorts of BM are the result of mixing of at least one spell of creation / manipulation (and up to three) and an element. There are eight creation / manipulation spells: Create, Remove, Detach (Move), Accelerate, Amplify, Intensify, Concentrate and Affix (Fix). Thus creating a fireball requires the following formula: Create Fire. If the magician wishes to launch the fireball at an enemy, he must use Detach Fire. A magician who wants to create and launch a fireball at the same time uses a spell with the formula Detach Create Fire. Knowing that we can combine up to three spells of creation / manipulation with an item, the number of possible combinations is immense. A magician will generally focus on one or two elements and attempt to optimize combinations using them. BM is much more dangerous than the magic commonly found in other games. For example, an intermediate magician (e.g. MKL9, which is the level at which teachers become magicians and can take a student) can cast a fireball that causes 130 to 240 Body points of damage, with an <b>average</b> <b>damage</b> of 180. An average man has 30 body points and an athletic one rarely exceeds 50 points. In contrast, in AD&D the fireball spell is unlikely to kill a character in a same average level as the caster.|$|E

40|$|Carbon {{films with}} up to 32 at. % of {{nitrogen}} have been prepared with ion beam assisted magnetron, using a N 2 +/N+ beam at energies between 50 and 300 eV. The composition and density of the films vary strongly with the deposition parameters. EELS, SXS, XPS, and IR studies show that these a-C: N films are mostly graphitic and have up to 20 % sp 3 bonding. Nitrogen is mostly combined with carbon in nitrile (C = N) and imine (C = N) groups. It is shown by RBS and NDP that density goes through a maximum as the <b>average</b> <b>damage</b> energy per incoming ion increases. Positron annihilation spectroscopy shows that the void concentration in the films goes through a minimum with <b>average</b> <b>damage</b> energy. These {{results are consistent with}} a densification induced by the collisions at low <b>average</b> <b>damage</b> energy values and induced graphitization at higher damage energy values. These results are similar to what is observed for Ar ion assisted deposition of a-C films. The mechanical properties of these films have been studied with a nanoindenter, and {{it was found that the}} hardness and Young's modulus go through a maximum as the <b>average</b> <b>damage</b> energy is increased. The maximum of mechanical properties corresponds to the minimum in the void concentration in the film.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of coastal flood risks {{in a particular}} region requires the estimation of typical damages caused by storm surges of certain characteristics and annualities. Although the damage depends on a multitude of factors, including flow velocity, duration of flood, precaution, etc., the relationship between flood events and the corresponding <b>average</b> <b>damages</b> is usually described by a stage-damage function, which considers the maximum water level as the only damage influencing factor. Starting with different (microscale) building damage functions we elaborate a macroscopic damage function for the entire case study area Kalundborg (Denmark) {{on the basis of}} multiple coarse-graining methods and assumptions of the hydrological connectivity. We find that for small events, the macroscopic damage function mostly depends on the properties of the elevation model, while for large events it strongly depends on the assumed building damage function.

40|$|Radiation damage {{formation}} in iron {{has been investigated}} using the method of molecular dynamics simulation. The MD simulations {{have been used to}} determine primary defect production parameters for cascade energies up to 50 keV at temperatures from 100 to 900 K. The energy dependence of these parameters has been used to determine appropriate neutron-energy-spectrum <b>averaged</b> <b>damage</b> production cross sections for various irradiation environments. Two applications of these effective cross sections are discussed. The first is an evaluation of neutron energy spectrum effects in commercial fission reactor pressure vessels. The second example deals with the use of these cross sections in the source term of a kinetic model used to predict void swelling and microstructural evolution. The simulation of the primary damage event by MD involves times less than 100 ps and a size scale of a few tens of nm, while the kinetic simulation encompasses several years and macroscopic sizes. This use of the MD results to develop an improved source term for rate theory modeling provides a simple example of multiscale modeling...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine post-harvest damage to rose apples due to transportation hazards and to comparatively evaluate the performance of the current and proposed wholesale packaging for the fruit. The methodology comprised of sampling and conducting damage analysis of rose apples of two varieties (Thongsamsri and Toonklao) distributed using commercial packaging to various retailers and wholesalers selected at random around the Bangkok metropolitan areas. Three kinds of current wholesale packaging were packed with newly harvested, damage-free, and uniform sized Thongsamsri rose apples and tested using a vibration simulator. The same testing was performed for the two types of proposed wholesale packaging. Performance of both types of packaging was evaluated in terms of damage parameters. Results showed that the post-harvest damage was mainly in the form of bruising and abrasion. The average fruit damage and the <b>average</b> <b>damage</b> percentage of abrasion were higher than that of bruising at both the wholesaler and retailer levels. The average fruit damage and the <b>average</b> <b>damage</b> percentages at the retailer were greater than that at the wholesaler for both varieties.
