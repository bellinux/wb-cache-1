In addition, up to 85% of the T3 in blood is produced following conversion from T4 by iodothyronine deiodinases in organs around the body.|$|E
5|$|Among brachiopods {{only the}} lingulids have been fished commercially, and only on <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> scale.

5|$|In {{a similar}} way, the {{particular}} energetic {{stability of the}} helium-4 nucleus, produced by similar effects, accounts for the ease of helium-4 production in atomic reactions that involve either heavy-particle emission or fusion. Some stable helium-3 (2 protons and 1 neutron) is produced in fusion reactions from hydrogen, but it is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> fraction compared to the highly favorable helium-4.|$|E

5|$|The {{average cost}} of {{crystalline}} boron is $5/g. Free boron is chiefly used in making boron fibers, where it is deposited by chemical vapor deposition on a tungsten core (see below).

Boron is introduced into semiconductors as boron compounds, by ion implantation.|$|E
