40|$|In {{this study}} gelatin hydrogels and their {{physicochemical}} properties are studied after chelation by EDTA. Gelatin is highly biocompatible, biodegradable, non immunogenic {{and can be}} modified at amino acid level. But due to its thermoreversible nature gelatin gels are not stable in nature and their mechanical strength is very low. Gelatin contains many divalent ions such as calcium, iron, and copper during denaturation process. Due to chelation activities of these divalent ions are diminished thereby making an EDTA metal ion complex. This process leads to more number of free carboxylic <b>acid</b> <b>strengthening</b> the interaction between cross linking agent and the gelatin gel network, hence increasing the stability and viscoelasticity of the gelatin hydrogels. Various characterization techniques were performed namely swelling studies, FTIR analysis, contact angle measurement, in vitro degradation, rheological studies and Hemocompatiblity tests. All the characterization techniques depicts that purified gelatin gel network when crosslinked with gluteraldehyde forms a more dense and stable network when compared with unpurified gelatin crosslinked with gluteraldehyde.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with solvated interaction energy method (SIE) were carried out to study the binding modes of three inhibitors 8 CA, F 8 A and I 4 A to A-FABP. The rank of our predicted binding affinities is in accordance with experimental data.

Computational alanine scanning and dynamics analyses were performed and the results suggest that the polar interactions of the positively charged residue R 126 with the three inhibitors provide a significant contribution to inhibitor bindings. This polar interaction induces the disappearance of the correlated motion of the C terminus of A-FABP relative to the N terminus and favors the stability of the binding complex.

Direct sources of formic acid include human activities, biomass burning and plant leaves. Aside from these direct sources, sunlight-induced oxidation of non-methane hydrocarbons (largely of biogenic origin) {{is probably the}} largest source 3, 4. However, model simulations substantially underpredict atmospheric formic acid levels 5 - 7, indicating that not all sources {{have been included in}} the models. Here, we use satellite measurements of formic acid concentrations to constrain model simulations of the global formic acid budget. According to our simulations, 100 - 120 Tg of formic acid is produced annually, which is two to three times more than that estimated from known sources. We show that 90 % of the formic acid produced is biogenic in origin, and largely sourced from tropical and boreal forests. We suggest that terpenoids (volatile organic compounds released by plants) are the predominant precursors. Model comparisons with independent observations of formic <b>acid</b> <b>strengthen</b> our conclusions, and provide indirect validation for the satellite measurements.

40|$|Trans {{fatty acid}} (TFA) from {{partially}} hydrogenated oil {{is regarded as}} the worst dietary fatty acid per gram due to its role in coronary heart disease. TFA consumption is decreasing worldwide, but some but not all observational studies indicate that TFA intake has little relevance to serum cholesterol levels in populations with low TFA intake (< 1 % E [percentage of total energy intake], <approximately 2 [*]g/day). Few intervention trials examined the effect of TFAs on blood cholesterol at relatively low levels (< 2 % E); no definite evidence is available on the tolerable upper level of the intake. A series of our intervention studies in Japanese suggested that an industrial TFA intake at < 1 % E does not influence the serum cholesterol level. To establish allowable level, we must consider not only the dietary level of TFAs, but also the composition of dietary fats simultaneously consumed, that is, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. These fatty <b>acids</b> <b>strengthen</b> or counteract the adverse effect of TFAs on serum cholesterol levels. In this review we describe the complex situation of the cardiovascular effects of industrial TFAs. The relationship between dietary industrial TFAs and concentration of plasma cholesterol should be evaluated from the viewpoint of dietary patterns rather than TFAs alone...|$|R

Hydrogen bonds, halogen bonds, and dative covalent bonds are found at P in some cases, depending {{on the nature of}} the Lewis acid. HLi forms a lithium bond with P only in the binary complex HLi:PH 3. The binding energies of ternary complexes exhibit a classical synergistic effect, although the computed cooperativity may be overestimated due to neglect of the interaction of the Lewis acid with NH 2 F or NH 3 in some cases. The hydrogen-bonding Lewis acids appear to have little effect on the strength of the P⋯N bond, while the remaining Lewis <b>acids</b> <b>strengthen</b> the pnicogen bond. 31 P absolute chemical shieldings increase in LA:H 2 FP:NFH 2 complexes relative to the corresponding LA:PH 2 F complexes as the positive charge on P decreases, while chemical shieldings decrease in LA:H 3 P:NH 3 relative to the corresponding LA:PH 3 complexes as the positive charge increases. Absolute values of 1 pJ(P-N) spin-spin coupling constants in complexes LA:H 2 FP:NFH 2 decrease as the P-N distance decreases.

40|$|AbstractIn {{mammalian}} preovulatory oocytes, rRNA synthesis is down-regulated until egg fertilization and zygotic genome reactivation, but {{the underlying}} regulatory mechanisms {{of this phenomenon}} are poorly characterized. We examined the molecular organization of the rRNA synthesis and processing machineries in fully grown mouse oocytes in relation to ongoing rDNA transcription and oocyte progression throughout meiosis. We show that, at the germinal vesicle stage, the two RNA polymerase I (RNA pol I) subunits, RPA 116 and PAF 53 /RPA 53, and the nucleolar upstream binding factor (UBF) remain present irrespective of ongoing rDNA transcription and colocalize in stoichiometric amounts within discrete foci at {{the periphery of the}} nucleolus-like bodies. These foci are spatially associated with the early pre-rRNA processing protein fibrillarin and in part with the pre-ribosome assembly factor B 23 /nucleophosmin. After germinal vesicle breakdown, the RNA pol I complex disassembles in a step-wise manner from chromosomes, while UBF remains associated with chromosomes until late prometaphase I. Dislodging of UBF, but not of RNA pol I, is impaired by the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic <b>acid,</b> thus <b>strengthening</b> the idea of a relationship between UBF dynamics and protein phosphorylation. Since neither RNA pol I, UBF, fibrillarin, nor B 23 is detected at metaphase II, i. e., the normal stage of fertilization, we conclude that these nucleolar proteins are not transported to fertilized eggs by maternal chromosomes. Together, these data demonstrate an essential difference in the dynamics of the major nucleolar proteins during mitosis and meiosis...|$|R

Nuclear localization of amyloid peptide aggregates together with amyloid-DNA interaction, have been repeatedly reported. In this paper we have used surface plasmon resonance and electron microscopy to study the structure and behavior of different peptides and proteins, including β-lactoglobulin, bovine serum albumin, myoglobin, histone, casein and the amyloid-β peptides related to Alzheimer's disease Aβ 25 - 35 and Aβ 1 - 40.

Furthermore, the Protein-RNA Interface Data Base (PRIDB) {{possesses}} a collection of information on RNA-protein interfaces based on data drawn from the PDB. Some common features of protein-RNA interfaces were deduced based on known structures. For example, RNP in snRNPs have an RNA-binding motif in its RNA-binding protein. Aromatic amino acid residues in this motif result in stacking interactions with RNA. Lysine residues in the helical portion of RNA-binding proteins help to stabilize interactions with nucleic acids. This nucleic <b>acid</b> binding is <b>strengthened</b> by electrostatic attraction between the positive lysine side chains and the negative nucleic acid phosphate backbones. Additionally, it is possible to model RNPs computationally. Although computational methods of deducing RNP structures are less accurate than experimental methods, they provide a rough model of the structure which allows for predictions of the identity of significant amino acids and nucleotide residues. Such information helps in understanding the overall function the RNP.'RNP' can also refer to ribonucleoprotein particles. Ribonucleoprotein particles are distinct intracellular foci for post-transcriptional regulation. These particles play an important role in influenza A virus replication. The influenza viral genome is composed of eight ribonucleoprotein particles formed by a complex of negative-sense RNA bound to a viral nucleoprotein. Each RNP carries with it an RNA polymerase complex. When the nucleoprotein binds to the viral RNA, it is able to expose the nucleotide bases which allow the viral polymerase to transcribe RNA. At this point, once the virus enters a host cell it will be prepared to begin the process of replication.|$|R

In this study, the anti-inflammatory potential of tomato ketchup was evaluated by studying the effect of tomato ketchup extracts and bioactives from tomato ketchup on human monocytes and vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC). HUVEC were pre-treated for 1 h with either individual bioactives (7. 5 µM lycopene, 1. 4 µM α-tocopherol or 55 µM ascorbic acid) or a combination of these three compounds, or with the hydrophilic or lipophilic tomato ketchup extracts or with the two extracts combined. After the pretreatment, the cells were washed and challenged with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for 6 h. The medium was used for the determination of the release of cytokines and the chemotaxis of monocytes. Inflammatory protein expression and production were assayed with real-time RT-PCR and ELISA. It was found that tomato ketchup extracts significantly reduced gene expression and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL- 8 in HUVEC after the inflammatory challenge, whereas the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10 was increased. Chemotaxis was effectively impeded as demonstrated by a reduced monocyte migration. This effect correlated with the reduction of IL- 8 production {{in the presence of the}} test compounds and extracts. The results consistently emphasize the contribution of lycopene to the anti-inflammatory effect of tomato ketchup.

40|$|The lack of {{an animal}} model that recapitulates the {{prominent}} features of HIV- 1 infection in humans limits the search for preventative and curative strategies against HIV- 1. As stated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), developing highly pathogenic simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs) that can establish persistent infections and AIDS progression in rhesus macaques (RMs) remains vital for advancing the field. 	The HIV- 1 envelope (Env) serves as a major target in vaccine studies. SHIVs - which are chimeras of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) backbone and a humanized Env, are utilized for preclinical evaluation of vaccines and therapeutics aimed at targeting the Env glycoprotein. However, SHIVs presently available poorly infect RM due to weak binding interactions between Env and rhesus CD 4 (rhCD 4). Position 375 (Env 375) lies within the rhCD 4 binding pocket of HIV- 1 Env. Accordingly, substituting the wild-type (WT) amino acid in Env 375 for bulky hydrophobic and/or basic amino <b>acids</b> may <b>strengthen</b> Env-rhCD 4 interactions. These mutations should increase the pathogenicity of our original SHIV challenge stocks (SHIV 162 p 3 and SHIVAE 16) and allow {{for the development of}} an animal model that closely mirrors HIV- 1 acquisition and chronic AIDS infection in humans. OBJECTIVES: To develop an animal model that recapitulates HIV- 1 infection and AIDS progression in humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SHIV design involved insertion of human env sequences into a modified SIV backbone (provided by Dr. George Shaw, University of Pennsylvania). Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to introduce amino acid substitutions at Env 375 for the following residues: serine, histidine, methionine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine. These constructs were then utilized for transfection of human embryonic kidney cells (293 T) with viral supernatants collected 72 hours post-transfection. 293 T viral supernatants were then used to infect human and rhesus PBMCs with the resulting supernatant harvested every three days and subjected to ELISA to monitor viral growth. Viruses were further characterized by RT-PCR for quantification and TCID 50 assays to determine infectious dose. Resulting SHIVs were then used for challenge studies in rhesus macaques. 	Sixteen rhesus macaques were divided into groups of four that received the following SHIV challenge stocks: (1) original SHIV 162 p 3, (2) modified SHIV 162 p 3, (3) original SHIVAE 16, and (4) modified SHIVAE 16. Following infection, animal plasma and sera were collected and subjected to post-challenge analyses such as cellular assays and measurements of plasma viral RNA levels. RESULTS: Several analyses were conducted to study the pathogenicity of the modified SHIV 162 p 3 and SHIVAE 16 relative to the original stocks. Regarding SHIV infectivity, several versions of the modified SHIVs exhibited greater in vitro infectivity titers than the original stocks. Additionally, preliminary viral load analyses conducted in vivo indicate that all sixteen RMs challenged with original and modified SHIVs were infected at comparable levels. Furthermore, CD 4 + T cell counts were measured and all sixteen animals exhibited declines in CD 4 + T cell percentages. CONCLUSION: In sum, the modified SHIVs may improve animal models by closely recapitulating the events of HIV- 1 infection in humans and serve better for future studies of preventative and curative treatments against HIV- 1. 2019 - 07 - 11 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The ESAT- 6 (early {{secreted}} antigenic target, 6 kDa) family collects small mycobacterial proteins secreted by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, {{particularly in}} the early phase of growth. There are 23 ESAT- 6 family members in M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv. In a previous work, we identified the Zur- dependent regulation of five proteins of the ESAT- 6 /CFP- 10 family (esxG, esxH, esxQ, esxR, and esxS). esxG and esxH are part of ESAT- 6 cluster 3, whose expression was already known to be induced by iron starvation. Results In this research, we performed EMSA experiments and transcriptional analysis of ESAT- 6 cluster 3 in Mycobacterium smegmatis (msmeg 0615 - msmeg 0625) and M. tuberculosis. In contrast to what we had observed in M. tuberculosis, we found that in M. smegmatis ESAT- 6 cluster 3 responds only to iron and not to zinc. In both organisms we identified an internal promoter, a finding which suggests the presence of two transcriptional units and, by consequence, a differential expression of cluster 3 genes. We compared the expression of msmeg 0615 and msmeg 0620 in different growth and stress conditions by means of relative quantitative PCR. The expression of msmeg 0615 and msmeg 0620 genes was essentially similar; {{they appeared to be}} repressed in most of the tested conditions, with the exception of acid stress (pH 4. 2) where msmeg 0615 was about 4 -fold induced, while msmeg 0620 was repressed. Analysis revealed that in acid stress conditions M. tuberculosis rv 0282 gene was 3 -fold induced too, while rv 0287 induction was almost insignificant. Conclusion In contrast with what has been reported for M. tuberculosis, our results suggest that in M. smegmatis only IdeR-dependent regulation is retained, while zinc has no effect on gene expression. The role of cluster 3 in M. tuberculosis virulence is still to be defined; however, iron- and zinc-dependent expression strongly suggests that cluster 3 is highly expressed in the infective process, and that the cluster contributes to the antigenic profile during the course of infection. Moreover, cluster 3 induction in <b>acid</b> stress conditions <b>strengthens</b> the hypothesis that cluster 3 is expressed in the course of infection. In M. smegmatis, the expression of msmeg 0615 and msmeg 0620 genes is broadly similar in differing growth phases and in stress conditions, with the exception of acid stress (pH 4. 2). Differences in expression between cluster 3 genes {{can be explained by the}} presence of internal promoters, both in M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis. </p...|$|R

With all these creatures that are at strife among themselves, and that birds prey upon, I am at peace, even to the {{smallest}} that are visible--the red spider which is no spider; and the minute gossamer spider clinging to the fine silvery hairs of the flying summer; and the coccus that fall from the fruit trees to float on their buoyant cottony down--a summer snow. Fils de la Vierge are these, and sacred. The man who can needlessly set his foot on a worm is as strange to my soul as De Quincey's imaginary Malay, or even his [...] "damned crocodile." [...] The worm that one sees lying bruised and incapable on the gravel walk has fallen among thieves. These little lives do me good and not harm. I smell the <b>acid</b> ants to <b>strengthen</b> my memory. I know that if I set an overturned cockchafer on his legs three sins shall be forgiven me; that if I am kindly tolerant of the spider that drops accidentally on my hand or face, my purse shall be mysteriously replenished. At the same time, one has to remember that such sentiments, as a rule, are not understood {{by those who have}} charge over groves and gardens, whose minds are ignorant and earthy, or, as they would say, practical. Of the balance of nature they know and care naught, nor can they regard life as sacred; it is enough to know that it is or may be injurious to their interests for them to sweep it away. The small thing that has been flying about and uttering musical sounds since April may, when July comes, devour a certain number of cherries. Nor is even this plea needed. If it is innocent for the lower creatures to prey upon one another, it cannot be less innocent for man to destroy them indiscriminately, if it gives him any pleasure to do so. It is idle to go into such subtle questions with those who have the power to destroy; if their hands are to be restrained it is not by appealing to feelings which they do not possess, but to their lower natures--to their greed and their cunning. For the rest of us, for all who have conquered or outgrown the killing instinct, the impartiality that pets nothing and persecutes nothing is doubtless man's proper attitude towards the inferior animals; a godlike benevolent neutrality; a keen and kindly interest in every form of life, with indifference as to its ultimate destiny; the softness which does no wrong with the hardness that sees no wrong done.|$|R
40|$|B 9 8 9 = =; < eposits {{formed on}} {{surfaces}} of the containing system during circulation of aqueous ThO/sub 2 / slurries at high temperature. Although entire surfaces of systems were coated with 1 / 4 to 1 / 8 -in. - thick thoria deposits, cake formation was usually localized, forming preferentially in the pump impeller. Frequently, impeller deposits accelerated bearing failure. Cake formation was usually accompanied by formation of equal dense spherical aggregates 5 to 60 mu in diameter which remained suspended in the slurry. Caking and sphere forming phenomena, as investigated by tests of slurry properties in the laboratory and in a 30 -gpm slurry loop, are described, as are methods for preventing caking. Thoria cakes and spheres are believed to form by reagglomeration of small particles or fragments worn or chipped off the larger thoria particles composing the initial slurry. It is thought that small fragments are forced over each other by the shear stress into positions of minimum energy where they are held together by van der Waals' forces. Thoria solubility is not believed to be an appreciable factor in cske or sphere formation. The extent of chemical bonding in the deposits is not clear. Greatest cake-forming tendency was noted in thoria prepared by calcination of Th(C/sub 2 /O/sub 4 /) /sub 2 / at 800 deg C, though cakes did occur with other ThO/ sub 2 / preparations. Deposits formed from oxide batches that contained particles more resistant to degradation were softer, apparently because there were fewer fine fragments. A deposition preference between different metal surfaces {{as well as between}} differert velocity sections was noted. Cake formation by fresh batches of thoria, that is, slurry in which the initial oxide particles were not made finer by previous circulation, is prevented by any factor which reduces particle comminution. Cake formation is avoided if particles are too resistant to degradation or if they degrade rapidly to intermediate-size particles. Intermediate-size particles, 0. 1 to 0. 5 mu, apparently do not yield fine fragments readily because of the reduced shear forces which are acting on smaller particles. Improved particle integrity can be accomplished by the method of oxide preparation, for example, the use of high calcining temperature or long digestion time. Cake formation by fresh oxides is also prevented by the addition of small quantities of surface-active electrolytes to the slurry. Effective electrolytes tested included CrO/sub 3 /, NsAlO/sub 2 /, Na/sub 2 /SiO/sub 3 /, and MoO/sub 3 /. The electrolytes are thought to be effective by means of reducing particle fragmentation. Prevention of cske formation by slurries already containing particles in the caking-size range (e. g., a slurry composed of spheres produced during circulation) is more difficult, because agglomeration of the fine particles must be prevented. Lithium sulfate tended to reduce cake formation but was not completely effective. Other electrolyte additives tested (CrO/sub 3 / and NsAlO/sub 2 /) failed to hinder cake formation during ThC/sub 2 / sphere circulation. (These spheres were "loop produced" in a previous slurry circulation experiment.) However, after extended circulation during which partial dispersion of the spheres took place, cake formation was almost absent. It is postulated that the very fine particles wearing off the spheres gradually agglomerate into particles which are too large to form cskes but so small that fine particles or fragments are not worn off readily. Autoclaving of fresh thoria in water or dilute <b>acids</b> did not <b>strengthen</b> the particles sufficiently to prevent cake formation. Cake formation did not occur when the loop circulation temperature was reduced to 45 deg C. Extremely low thoria concentration did not deter cake formation. The integrity of loop-produced spheres was greatly improved by a combination of chemical and thermal treatment but was not improved sufficiently to prevent cake formation. Cake deposited in a ThO/sub 2 /- circulation system is partially destroyed by thermal cycling and can be remove...|$|R
40|$|Manganese (Mn) is an {{essential}} element that functions as a cofactor in the metabolism of carbohydrates and proteins, {{and it is also}} incorporated in antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase. In general, intake of Mn mainly occurs via food. Additional or excess exposure might occur via drinking water, as elevated concentrations of Mn in ground water are prevalent worldwide. In recent years, several studies have shown associations between Mn concentrations in drinking water and adverse health effects in children. A few studies have concerned early-life exposure, but these have mostly been cross sectional in design or with a very short follow-up of the children. Prospective studies which follow the children from early intrauterine life to childhood and explore associated adverse effects are lacking. The overall aim of the present thesis was to assess the potential effects of Mn exposure via drinking water during pregnancy and early-life on fetal outcomes (spontaneous abortion and perinatal mortality), size at birth, and child development (cognitive function and behavior). These prospective cohort studies were nested in a population-based trial involving food and micronutrient supplementation (Maternal and Infant Nutrition Interventions in Matlab; MINIMat), conducted from November 2001 to October 2003, in 4, 436 pregnant women in Matlab, Bangladesh. A subsample of the children born within the MINIMat trial was selected for longitudinal follow-up of growth and development until 10 years of age. In Matlab, 70 % of the drinking water wells contained high concentration of arsenic (> 10 µg/L, mostly in shallow wells), a potent toxicant and carcinogen. To reduce the exposure to arsenic the inhabitants were recommended to install deeper wells. Later we revealed that over 40 % of the wells (mainly deeper well > 50 m), contained > 400 µg Mn/L (previous WHO guideline value). The Mn exposure in the present studies was assessed by the concentrations in drinking water used by the mothers during pregnancy and by the children at 5 and 10 years of age, and measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The median water Mn concentration has increased from about 200 µg/L during pregnancy to 339 µg/L when the children were 10 years old, whereas the arsenic concentrations decreased (median from 33 to 2. 3 µg/L) during the same period. This is probably due to the ongoing installation of deeper wells. In early pregnancy (n= 1, 875), women in the highest tertile of water Mn concentrations (median= 1, 292 µg/L) had an approximately 35 % reduced risk (Odds Ratio = 0. 65, 95 % CI 0. 43, 0. 99) of spontaneous abortion, compared with women in the lowest tertile (median= 56 µg/L). This is possibly related to the role of Mn in the placental antioxidant defense. Elevated water Mn concentrations were not related to any increased risk of perinatal mortality. The newborns (n= 1, 177) to mothers in the highest tertile of water Mn (median= 1, 495 µg/L) were on average 0. 5 cm shorter (0. 20 SD) compared to those in the lowest tertile (median 56 µg/L). The association was strongest in the girls, but apparent also in the boys of mothers with low hemoglobin (Hb) values ( 3 mg/L) and in girls of mothers with anemia. Early-life appeared to be a particularly susceptible period to inverse effects on development by elevated water Mn concentrations, although the effect differed by outcome, time-point of exposure and child gender. In conclusion, the Mn concentrations in well water varied widely. Elevated concentrations during pregnancy appeared to be protective for early fetal loss. On the other hand, the exposure during pregnancy decreased fetal growth and impaired the children´s cognitive function and worsened their difficult behavior, especially in children of anemic women. Thus, Mn concentration in drinking water is an important public health concern worldwide. However, in arsenic contaminated areas, the benefit of deep wells with less arsenic is most likely higher than the modest adverse effects of Mn. In order to reduce the exposure to arsenic and Mn through well water, screening for both elements by sediment color tools could be done during installation of new wells, as well as digging wells in aquifers that are low in both arsenic and Mn (deeper than 100 m). As Mn absorption tends to be higher in anemic women, existing routine programs, including assessment of anemia during pregnancy and supplementation with iron and folic <b>acid,</b> should be <b>strengthened.</b> Also, screening and treating children with anemia can be proposed as an important public health intervention...|$|R
