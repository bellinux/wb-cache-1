Wyatt {{received a letter from}} his older brother Virgil that year, who was the town constable in Prescott, Arizona Territory. Virgil wrote Wyatt about the opportunities in the silver-mining boomtown of Tombstone. Later in life, Wyatt wrote, [...] "In 1879, Dodge was beginning to lose much of the snap which had given it a charm to men of reckless blood, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> move to Tombstone, which was just building up a reputation." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1953–54 NBA season, the now 29-year-old Mikan slowly declined, {{averaging}} 18.1 points, 14.3 {{rebounds and}} 2.4 assists per game. Under his leadership, the Lakers won another NBA {{title in the}} 1954 NBA Finals, making it their third-straight championship and fifth in six years; the only time they lost had been when Mikan fractured his leg. From an NBA perspective, the Minneapolis Lakers dynasty has only been convincingly surpassed by the eleven-title Boston Celtics dynasty of 1957–69. At {{the end of the}} season, Mikan announced his retirement. He later said: [...] "I had a family growing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> be with them. I felt {{it was time to get}} started with the professional world outside of basketball." [...] Injuries also were a factor, as Mikan had sustained 10 broken bones and 16 stitches in his career, often having to play through these injuries.|$|E
500|$|A Secret Service agent, Bond was a {{composite}} {{based on a}} number of commandos whom author Ian Fleming had known during his service in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II, to whom he added his own style and a number of his own tastes. Fleming appropriated the name from American ornithologist James Bond. Bond's code number 007 comes from one of British naval intelligence's key achievements of World War I: the breaking of the German diplomatic code. One of the German documents cracked and read by the British was the Zimmermann Telegram, which was coded 0075, and {{which was one of the}} factors that led the US entering the war. Subsequently, if material was graded 00 it meant it was highly classified. Fleming later told a journalist, [...] "When I was at the Admiralty... all the top-secret signals had the double-0 prefix... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> borrow it for Bond".|$|E

500|$|On May 29, Conley {{was interviewed}} for four hours. His new {{affidavit}} said that Frank told him, [...] "he {{had picked up}} a girl back there and let her fall and that her head hit against something." [...] Conley said he and Frank took the body to the basement via the elevator, then returned to Frank's office where the murder notes were dictated. Conley then hid in the wardrobe after the two {{had returned to the}} office. He said Frank gave him $200, but took it back, saying, [...] "Let me have that and I will make it all right with you Monday if I live and nothing happens." [...] Conley's affidavit concluded, [...] "The reason I have not told this before is I thought Mr. Frank would get out and help me out <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> tell the whole truth about this matter." [...] At trial, Conley changed his story concerning the $200. He said Frank decided to withhold the money until Conley had burned Phagan's body in the basement furnace.|$|E
500|$|Daavettila {{graduated}} from Michigan Tech in 2008 and tried {{out for the}} Flint Generals of the International Hockey League (IHL). He appeared in two games for the Generals {{at the end of}} the season (for only about three shifts), and did not register a point. Daavettila had not originally planned to pursue a professional hockey career, but said [...] "When I got one skate with Flint, it kind of sparked my interest <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> give it a try". During the off-season, Daavettila worked for a structural engineering firm in Saginaw, Michigan. He used vacation time at the start of the next hockey season later in 2008 to try out for the Grand Rapids Griffins of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Muskegon Lumberjacks (IHL), though he was rejected by both teams. Tryouts with two more IHL teams, the Kalamazoo Wings and the Bloomington PrairieThunder, did not result in a contract either. Daavettila assumed his hockey career was over and went back to his engineering job, but he continued to skate a couple times a week. He had left an impression on Kalamazoo coach Nick Bootland, however, who called Daavettila back in March 2009 after his team was depleted by injuries. [...] "You could see he had a skill set," [...] said Bootland. [...] "But I thought the way he held on to the puck, he was going to get himself killed. ... You kept thinking he was going to make a mistake. Then he'd pop a guy for a breakaway." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Pearce:"In 1986 whilst {{staying with}} Tibet in his flat in Freya Aswynn's house in north London {{over a period}} of 3 nights I dreamed I was falling in a sort of rain of indistinct runes. On each {{separate}} night I managed to concentrate enough on one particular rune to stop it from spinning and moving so I could actually see which one it was. When I awoke I made a note of it. After 3 nights the dream stopped <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> try and form an 'appropriate' bind rune from the original 3. This I did and after Freya saw it I basically was given a 'thumbs up' about the whole thing. It definitely does not refer to my name but it definitely does refer to ME." ...|$|E

He sent an MP3 of [...] "Caylee" [...] to CNN and the cable news show Nancy Grace, {{as well as to}} various radio stations and Internet radio stations. Rascal Flatts' Gary LeVox collaborated with country comedian and radio host Cledus T. Judd and songwriter Jimmy Yeary to write a song titled [...] "She's Going Places" [...] in Caylee's memory, which would be performed by singer Shane Hines. On July8, 2011, Grace played it for her audience.|$|E
2500|$|Some of the diary's {{passages}} are unflinching in {{exposing the}} behavior at the imperial court, particularly that of drunken courtiers who seduced the ladies-in-waiting. As Keene describes it, {{the court was}} a place where the courtiers were [...] "drunken men who make obscene jokes and paw at women". Murasaki complained about drunk courtiers and princes who behaved badly, such as the incident when at a banquet court poet Fujiwara no Kintō joined a group of women asking whether Murasaki was present– alluding to the character in The Tale of Genji. Murasaki retorted that none of the novel's characters lived at this tawdry and unpleasant court, so unlike the court in her novel. She left the banquet when [...] "Counsellor Takai... started pulling at Lady Hyōbu's robes and singing dreadful songs, but His Excellency said nothing.

2500|$|After Deepta's birth, Chakraverti {{decided to}} start her work of Wicca and help women in the villages of West Bengal, where many used {{to be accused of}} {{witchcraft}} and killed. Chakraverti finally declared in front of the media, in 1986, that she was a witch. A backlash followed, including protest movements and boycotts, led by the Bengal CPM leader Jyoti Basu. However, Chakraverti put all allegations to rest and addressed the media at a press conference. There, she spoke about how Wicca is a Neo pagan religion and a form of modern witchcraft. It {{is often referred to as}} Witchcraft or the Craft by its adherents, who are known as Wiccans or Witches. She declared that she wished to start her own healing center and curb the [...] "witch-killings" [...] happening at that time in rural Bengal. The press was impressed by her knowledge and her straightforwardness in addressing such a taboo subject. She later clarified, [...] "I had the social and economic padding <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> use it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 1917, Sidorova {{joined the}} Astrakhan musical college {{to study the}} piano. She had no {{instrument}} at home, and had to stay at school to practise literally day and night. In the early 1918, she started studying vocal, originally as contralto. Regarded {{as one of the}} best in the class, she was often sent on obligatory 'tours' to sing for the Red Army soldiers and sailors. [...] "I enjoyed success and was extremely proud of it", she later wrote. One of her tutors, Smolenskaya, started to train Sidorova as soprano, which Sidorova greatly enjoyed. [...] "With her I studied for a year. Then the Astrakhan theatre was moved to Tsaritsyn <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> join its troupe, so as to go on studying with my pedagogue," [...] she later recalled. [...] " [...] mastered a professional vocal range, demonstrating flawless precision in intonations and perfect sense of rhythm. What was most attractive in the young singer's performances was her musical and verbal expressiveness, her total involvement with the lyrics", wrote Mikhail Lvov in his 1947 biography.|$|E
2500|$|I made a {{whole series}} of studies to prepare this portrait. Drawings and washes in china ink. I {{analysed}} the architecture of the head in monumentally sized enlargements, two or three times the natural size, I made a certain number of drawings of the hands, I studied the organisation and the overall effect, volumes and the relations of the formal elements between themselves. Finally, I reduced the colour to a harmony of blacks and greys supported by some flashes of light red which set up a contrast, at once breaking with and supporting the interplay of harmonious colour relations. Nayral came regularly to the studio, I worked directly on him, naturally, {{but more often than not}} the work consisted in friendly conversation, in walks in the garden, during which I studied him, watching what was his natural way of walking and what were his usual gestures, above all arming my memory with essential characteristics, trying to isolate his true likeness from the accumulation of details and picturesque superfluities which always interfere with the permanent reality of a being. The portrait was executed without turning to the model, it was finished some weeks before the Automne <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> show it... if the jury would be willing to accept it, as I was not yet a member.

2500|$|Infielder Stephen Drew {{returned}} from the disabled list, with Grace once again optioned to Syracuse, and the Nationals began a nine-game swing through California on May 29. On {{the first game of}} the road trip, the Nationals obtained their second shutout win of the year, beating the San Francisco Giants 3–0 behind a strong start by Tanner Roark. The game was marred, however, by an eighth-inning brawl that broke out after Giants reliever Hunter Strickland, facing Harper for the first time since the Nationals right fielder went 2-for-2 with two home runs off him during the 2014 National League Division Series, drilled Harper in the hip with a 98mph fastball with his first pitch. Harper tossed aside his bat and charged Strickland on the mound, throwing his helmet wide to the left of Strickland before the two players traded punches. They were separated by their teammates, with Giants first baseman and former National Michael Morse quickly getting between them before being bowled over (and concussed) by Giants pitcher and former University of Notre Dame football star Jeff Samardzija, and ejected from the game. Harper said after the game that he decided immediately that the pitch was intentional: [...] "You never want to get suspended or anything like that, but sometimes you've got to go and get him. You can't hesitate. You either go to first base or you go after him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> go after him." [...] He suggested Strickland was retaliating for the 2014 home runs (which Strickland denied), saying, [...] "It was three years ago. ... I don't know why he's thinking about it. He's got a World Series ring, it's on his finger, and he can look at it every single night he wants to." [...] Both Harper and Strickland were issued suspensions by Major League Baseball, with Harper receiving a four-game penalty, which was lowered on appeal to three games.
