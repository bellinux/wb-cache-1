5|$|In nature, free oxygen is {{produced}} by the light-driven splitting of water during oxygenic photosynthesis. According to some estimates, green algae and cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about 70% of the free oxygen produced on Earth, and the rest {{is produced}} by terrestrial plants. Other estimates of the oceanic contribution to <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oxygen</b> are higher, while some estimates are lower, suggesting oceans produce ~45% of Earth's <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oxygen</b> each year.|$|E
5|$|A primary size-limiting {{factor is}} the amount of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oxygen.</b> Without a complex circulatory system, low {{concentrations}} of oxygen cannot reach the centre of an organism quickly enough to supply its metabolic demand.|$|E
5|$|Donald Canfield {{detected}} {{records of}} the first significant quantities of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oxygen</b> just before the first Ediacaran fossils appeared– {{and the presence of}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oxygen</b> was soon heralded as a possible trigger for the Ediacaran radiation. Oxygen seems to have accumulated in two pulses; the rise of small, sessile (stationary) organisms seems to correlate with an early oxygenation event, with larger and mobile organisms appearing around the second pulse of oxygenation. However, the assumptions underlying the reconstruction of atmospheric composition have attracted some criticism, with widespread anoxia having little effect on life where it occurs in the Early Cambrian and the Cretaceous.|$|E
2500|$|Movement {{of oxygen}} between the {{reservoirs}} is facilitated {{in large part}} by the presence of <b>atmospheric</b> free <b>oxygen.</b> The main source of <b>atmospheric</b> free <b>oxygen</b> is photosynthesis, which produces sugars and free oxygen from carbon dioxide and water: ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{lithosphere}} also consumes <b>atmospheric</b> free <b>oxygen</b> by {{chemical weathering}} and surface reactions. An example of surface weathering chemistry is formation of iron oxides (rust): ...|$|R
5|$|The Marcellus was {{deposited}} {{during a}} period of development of land plants, when <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oxygen</b> was increasing, resulting in a reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and the seawater where it was deposited.|$|E
5|$|The major {{advances}} in catalytic {{versions of this}} reaction have steered towards co-oxidants that regenerate the palladium(II) species effectively. Specifically, conditions using <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oxygen</b> as well as stoichiometric allylcarbonate have been developed.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium(V) {{fluoride}} can {{be prepared}} by reacting protactinium oxide with either bromine pentafluoride or bromine trifluoride at about 600°C, and protactinium(IV) fluoride is obtained from the oxide and a mixture of hydrogen and hydrogen fluoride at 600°C; a large excess of hydrogen is required to remove <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oxygen</b> leaks into the reaction.|$|E
2500|$|An {{additional}} {{source of}} <b>atmospheric</b> free <b>oxygen</b> comes from photolysis, whereby high-energy ultraviolet radiation breaks down atmospheric water and nitrous oxide into component atoms. The free H and [...] escape into space, leaving O2 in the atmosphere: ...|$|R

25|$|Methylene blue {{is also a}} {{photosensitizer}} used {{to create}} singlet oxygen when exposed to both oxygen and light. It is used in this regard to make organic peroxides by a Diels-Alder reaction which is spin forbidden with normal <b>atmospheric</b> triplet <b>oxygen.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{isotopes}} of chromium {{range in}} atomic mass from 43u (43Cr) to 67u (67Cr). The primary decay mode before {{the most abundant}} stable isotope, 52Cr, is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta decay. 53Cr has been posited {{as a proxy for}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentration.|$|E
5|$|A typical fish is ectothermic, has a {{streamlined}} body for rapid swimming, extracts oxygen from water using gills or uses an accessory breathing organ to breathe <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oxygen,</b> has {{two sets of}} paired fins, usually one or two (rarely three) dorsal fins, an anal fin, and a tail fin, has jaws, has skin that is usually covered with scales, and lays eggs.|$|E
5|$|The {{respiratory}} system {{is an important}} factor that limits the size of insects. As insects get bigger, this type of oxygen transport gets less efficient and thus the heaviest insect currently weighs less than 100g. However, with increased <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oxygen</b> levels, as happened in the late Paleozoic, larger insects were possible, such as dragonflies with wingspans of more than two feet.|$|E

5|$|All welding of {{titanium}} {{must be done}} in an {{inert atmosphere}} of argon or helium to shield it from contamination with <b>atmospheric</b> gases (<b>oxygen,</b> nitrogen, and hydrogen). Contamination causes a variety of conditions, such as embrittlement, which reduces {{the integrity of the}} assembly welds and leads to joint failure.|$|R
5|$|Copper {{does not}} react with water, {{but it does}} slowly react with <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oxygen</b> to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air, protects the {{underlying}} metal from further corrosion (passivation). A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper structures, such as the roofing of many older buildings and the Statue of Liberty. Copper tarnishes when exposed to some sulfur compounds, with which it reacts to form various copper sulfides.|$|E
5|$|Late Carboniferous and Early Permian insect orders {{include both}} extant groups, their stem groups, {{and a number}} of Paleozoic groups, now extinct. During this era, some giant dragonfly-like forms reached wingspans of , making them far larger than any living insect. This {{gigantism}} may have been due to higher <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oxygen</b> levels that allowed increased respiratory efficiency relative to today. The lack of flying vertebrates could have been another factor. Most extinct orders of insects developed during the Permian period that began around 270 million years ago. Many of the early groups became extinct during the Permian-Triassic extinction event, the largest mass extinction {{in the history of the}} Earth, around 252 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Palaeobotanists study ancient {{plants in}} the fossil record to provide {{information}} about the evolutionary history of plants. Cyanobacteria, the first oxygen-releasing photosynthetic organisms on Earth, are thought to have given rise to the ancestor of plants by entering into an endosymbiotic relationship with an early eukaryote, ultimately becoming the chloroplasts in plant cells. The new photosynthetic plants (along with their algal relatives) accelerated the rise in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oxygen</b> started by the cyanobacteria, changing the ancient oxygen-free, reducing, atmosphere to one in which free oxygen has been abundant for more than 2 billion years.|$|E
50|$|The {{oxidative}} leaching {{stage is}} carried out in agitated tanks operating at <b>atmospheric</b> pressure. <b>Oxygen</b> is introduced to the leach slurry to assist the oxidation. Leaching is autothermal, not requiring any external heat. Temperature {{is controlled by the}} rate of addition of oxygen, and by the leach slurry density.|$|R
40|$|The {{temperature}} sensitivity of Raman backscattering from <b>atmospheric</b> nitrogen, <b>oxygen,</b> and water vapor is considered {{over the range}} of temperatures expected in the troposphere. These results are applied to the Raman spectrum induced by a XeF excimer laser, which produces three line groups centered at approximately 349, 351, and 353 nm. Bandpass filter characteristics are determined for this case...|$|R
5000|$|By far {{the largest}} {{reservoir}} of Earth's oxygen is within the silicate and oxide minerals of the crust and mantle (99.5%). Only a small portion has been released as free oxygen to the biosphere (0.01%) and atmosphere (0.36%). The main source of <b>atmospheric</b> free <b>oxygen</b> is photosynthesis, which produces sugars and free oxygen from carbon dioxide and water: ...|$|R
5|$|Plants convert {{carbon dioxide}} into biomass and emit oxygen into the atmosphere. By {{approximately}} 350 {{million years ago}} (the end of the Devonian period), photosynthesis had brought the concentration of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oxygen</b> above 17%, which allowed combustion to occur. Fire releases CO2 and converts fuel into ash and tar. Fire is a significant ecological parameter that raises many issues pertaining to its control and suppression. While the issue of fire in relation to ecology and plants has been recognized for a long time, Charles Cooper brought attention {{to the issue of}} forest fires in relation to the ecology of forest fire suppression and management in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Potassium is an {{extremely}} active metal that reacts violently with oxygen in water and air. With oxygen it forms potassium peroxide, and with water potassium forms potassium hydroxide. The reaction of potassium with water is dangerous because of its violent exothermic character {{and the production of}} hydrogen gas. Hydrogen reacts again with <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oxygen,</b> producing water, which reacts with the remaining potassium. This reaction requires only traces of water; because of this, potassium and the liquid sodium-potassium — NaK — are potent desiccants {{that can be used to}} dry solvents prior to distillation.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of a supercontinent can dramatically affect the environment. The collision of plates will result in mountain building, thereby shifting weather patterns. Sea levels may fall because of increased glaciation. The rate of surface weathering can rise, resulting {{in an increase in}} the rate that organic material is buried. Supercontinents can cause a drop in global temperatures and an increase in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oxygen.</b> This, in turn, can affect the climate, further lowering temperatures. All of these changes can result in more rapid biological evolution as new niches emerge.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} {{multiple}} scattering inversion procedure for the aerosol extinction coefficient profile retrieval and error assessment for nadir and multi-angle passive remote sensing instruments. The procedure will be applied for the tropospheric aerosol extinction coefficient profile retrieval from SCIAMACHY nadir simulated measurements using <b>atmospheric</b> windows and <b>oxygen</b> A-band wavelengths. Also the contemporary use of <b>atmospheric</b> windows and <b>oxygen</b> A-band wavelengths will be discussed. SCIAMACHY simulated measurement has been used because, due to calibration real data procedure problems, until now SCIAMACHY data are not available...|$|R
5000|$|Obligate anaerobes are {{microorganisms}} {{killed by}} normal <b>atmospheric</b> concentrations of <b>oxygen</b> (20.95% O2). [...] Oxygen tolerance varies between species, some capable of surviving {{in up to}} 8% oxygen, others losing viability unless the oxygen concentration is less than 0.5%. An important distinction {{needs to be made}} here between the obligate anaerobes and the microaerophiles. Microaerophiles, like the obligate anaerobes, are damaged by normal <b>atmospheric</b> concentrations of <b>oxygen.</b> However, microaerophiles metabolise energy aerobically, and obligate anaerobes metabolise energy anaerobically. Microaerophiles therefore require oxygen (typically 2-10% O2) for growth. Obligate anaerobes do not.|$|R
25|$|Additional {{factors that}} {{may have contributed to}} the onset of the Neoproterozoic snowball include the {{introduction}} of <b>atmospheric</b> free <b>oxygen,</b> which may have reached sufficient quantities to react with methane in the atmosphere, oxidizing it to carbon dioxide, a much weaker greenhouse gas, and a younger — thus fainter — Sun, which would have emitted 6 percent less radiation in the Neoproterozoic.|$|R
5|$|Calcium metal melts at 842°C and boils at 1494°C, {{higher than}} its {{adjacent}} group 2 metals do. It crystallises in the face-centered cubic arrangement like strontium; above 450°C, it changes to an anisotropic hexagonal close-packed arrangement like magnesium. The density of 1.55g·cm−3 {{is the lowest}} in its group, with others decreasing towards it. Calcium can be cut with a knife with effort, although it is still harder than lead. While calcium is a poorer conductor of electricity than copper or aluminium by volume, it is a better conductor than both of them by mass due to its very low density. Although it is infeasible for terrestrial applications as it reacts quickly with <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oxygen,</b> its use as a conductor in space has been considered.|$|E
5|$|This {{reaction}} is exothermic and releases enough heat to ignite the resulting hydrogen {{in the presence}} of oxygen, possibly explosively splashing onlookers with potassium hydroxide, which is a strong alkali that destroys living tissue and causes skin burns. Finely grated potassium ignites in air at room temperature. The bulk metal ignites in air if heated. Because its density is 0.89 g/cm3, burning potassium floats in water that exposes it to <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oxygen.</b> Many common fire extinguishing agents, including water, either are ineffective or make a potassium fire worse. Nitrogen, argon, sodium chloride (table salt), sodium carbonate (soda ash), and silicon dioxide (sand) are effective if they are dry. Some Class D dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are also effective. These agents deprive the fire of oxygen and cool the potassium metal.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of incandescent filaments, recrystallisation of tungsten is signifiantly lowered by adding small amounts of thorium dioxide to the tungsten sintering powder before drawing the filaments. A small addition of thorium to tungsten thermocathodes considerably reduced the work function of electrons; as the result, electrons are emitted at considerably lower temperatures. Tungsten forms a one-atom-thick layer {{on the surface of}} thorium. The work function from a thorium surface is lowered possibly because of the electric field on the interface between thorium and tungsten formed due to thorium's greater electropositivity. Since the 1920s, thoriated tungsten wires have been used in electronic tubes and in the cathodes and anticathodes of X-ray tubes and rectifiers. Thanks to the reactivity of thorium with <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oxygen</b> and nitrogen, thorium also marks impurities in the evacuated tubes. The introduction of transistors in the 1950s significantly diminished this use, but not entirely. Thorium dioxide is used in gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) to increase the high-temperature strength of tungsten electrodes and improve arc stability. Thorium oxide is being replaced in this use with other oxides, such as those of zirconium, cerium, and lanthanum.|$|E
40|$|The upper {{waters of}} Lake Hoare, Antarctica, contain {{dissolved}} oxygen at {{about three times}} the normal saturation (≥ 42 mg liter− 1). The response of the heterotrophic plankton community to this high dissolved oxygen was evaluated by the criteria of CFU and d-[U- 14 C]glucose assimilated-respired. High dissolved oxygen was not inhibitory to d-[U- 14 C]glucose assimilation-respiration compared with normal <b>atmospheric</b> dissolved <b>oxygen</b> in Lake Hoare water. The d-[U- 14 C]glucose was assimilated and respired optimally at 12 °C in Lake Hoare. The d-[U- 14 C]glucose assimilated-respired in the upper saturated <b>atmospheric</b> dissolved <b>oxygen</b> waters of Mountain Lake, Va., was inhibited in contrast to Lake Hoare (P < 0. 05). CFU formation was inhibited in both lakes. CFU represent < 1 % of the fluorochrome-stained direct counts in Lake Hoare. Lake Hoare planktobacteria are smaller than the planktobacteria in Mountain Lake. ATP size fractionation revealed that 39 % of the ATP biomass was < 0. 5 μm in Lake Hoare...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{infrared}} radiance of comet-associated water vapor clouds described by Frank et al. (1986 b) is large relative to natural background emissions. This IR emission arises from scattering of solar radiation and earth-shine and from excitation by upper <b>atmospheric</b> atomic <b>oxygen.</b> As a consequence, observations in space or from high-altitude platforms should provide an unambiguous signature of the entry of such objects into earth's atmosphere...|$|R
