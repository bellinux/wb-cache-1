As of 1990, Fushimi Inari Shrine had performed it eighty thousand times for private citizens. The faithful are often given the option to give a personal name to their personal kami. At Toyokawa Inari the worshiper can buy a statue and then participate in the ceremony, called kaigen, to animate it.|$|E

40|$|The artwork {{market is}} plenty of {{unauthorized}} reproduction of original products. One of the most varies filed is the counterfeiting of <b>Authenticity</b> <b>Certificate</b> related to paints, lithography, sculptures, etc., with the aim to create an illegal market of reproduced copies. To resolve this problematic, it is possible change the current paper certificate, related to a single artwork, with a digital version, which will contain some specific information, related to the artwork itself. In this paper, starting with the well-known advantages given by the biometry paradigm in human authentication, we propose a method able to distinguish the single “non-living” objects. In other words, we propose an approach that, by using the random inimitably characteristics, is able to uniquely identify artworks such as painting, lithographs, sculptures, etc. In this way it could be possible creating a secure digital certificate of authenticity (digital COA). Due to the high density information available in modern acquisition media, it is possible using a Speckle Metrology approach. During verification phase, the same area has to be acquired, to extract embedded verification data. It is possible to secure this data using a private key, necessary for accepting the digital signature. The presence of possible geometrical distortions between image present in the certificate and acquired during the verification phase, it is necessary applying geometrical corrections based on affine transformation, before executing the correlation methodologies, used in speckle metrology. </p...|$|E

25|$|The Modigliani {{estate is}} one of the most {{problematic}} in the art world. There are at least five catalogues raisonnés of the artist’s work including a volume by Ambrogio Ceroni, last updated in 1972. Arthur Pfannstiel (1929 and 1956) and Joseph Lanthemann's (1970) books are widely dismissed today. Milanese scholar Osvaldo Patani produced three volumes: paintings (1991), drawings (1992) and one on the Paul Alexandre period (1994), while Christian Parisot has published Volumes I, II and IV (in 1970, 1971 and 1996) of a catalogue raisonné. In 2006, about 6,000 documents from the estate—believed to be the only ones existing—were moved permanently from France to Italy. Parisot, as president of the Modigliani Institut Archives Legales in Rome, had the legal right to authenticate Modigliani’s work. In 2013, Parisot was arrested by the Italian art forgery unit after a two-year investigation; the police seized works attributed to the artist, along with suspect <b>authenticity</b> <b>certificates.</b>|$|R

50|$|During an interval, the {{transient}} {{private key}} {{is used to}} sign data concatenated with trusted timestamps and <b>authenticity</b> <b>certificates.</b> To verify the data at a later time, a receiver accesses the persistent public key for the appropriate time interval. The public key applied to the digital signature can be passed through published cryptographic routines to unpack the hash of the original data, which is then compared against a fresh hash of the stored data to verify data integrity. If the signature successfully decrypts using a particular interval’s published public key, the receiver can be assured that the signature originated during that time period. If the decrypted and fresh hashes match, the receiver can be assured that the data has not been tampered with since the transient private key created the timestamp and signed the data. Transient-key cryptography was invented in 1997 by Dr. Michael D. Doyle of Eolas Technologies Inc. and later acquired by and productized by ProofSpace, Inc. It is protected under US Patents #6,381,696, 7,017,046, 7,047,415, & 7,210,035, and has {{been included in the}} ANSI ASC X9.95 standard for Trusted Timestamping.

30|$|In {{this paper}} we present Laribus, a {{peer-to-peer}} network designed to detect local man-in-the-middle attacks against secure socket layer/transport layer security (SSL/TLS). With Laribus, clients can validate the <b>authenticity</b> of a <b>certificate</b> {{presented to them}} by retrieving it from different vantage points on the network. Unlike previous solutions, clients {{do not have to}} trust a central notary service nor do they have to rely on the cooperation of website owners. The Laribus network is based on a social network graph, which allows users to form notary groups that improve both privacy and availability. It integrates several well-known techniques, such as secret sharing, ring signatures, layered encryption, range queries, and a distributed hash table (DHT), to achieve privacy-aware queries, scalability, and decentralization. We present the design and core components of Laribus, discuss its security properties, and also provide results from a simulation-based feasibility study.|$|R

For security Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) adopt the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs). In the Public Key Infrastructure system the authentication of a received message is performed by checking if the certificate of the sender {{is included in the}} current Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and verifying the <b>authenticity</b> of the <b>certificate</b> and signature of the sender. But it takes more time for CRL checking process. So in order to overcome this problem we use an efficient revocation check process in EMAP uses a keyed Hash Message Authentication Code(HMAC), where the key used in calculating the HMAC is shared only between non-revoked On-Board Units (OBUs). In addition, EMAP uses a novel probabilistic key distribution which enables non-revoked OBUs to securely share and update a secret key. To conquer computation overhead we introduce the data aggregation using probabilistic checking that can accelerate message verifications and significantly reduce computational overhead while retaining satisfactory security...|$|R

The revocation check process in EMAP uses a keyed Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC), where the key used in calculating the HMAC is shared only between non-revoked On-Board Units (OBUs). In addition, EMAP uses a novel probabilistic key distribution, which enables non-revoked OBUs to securely share and update a secret key. EMAP can significantly decrease the message loss ratio due to the message verification delay compared with the conventional authentication methods employing CRL. By conducting security analysis and performance evaluation, EMAP is demonstrated to be secure and efficient...|$|R
40|$|In {{the middle}} of the night on September 2, 2011, the Dutch Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations held an {{emergency}} press conference. DigiNotar, a Certificate Authority (CA), had been electronically ‘broken into’ and as a result intruders had managed to generate falsified certificates. As a CA, DigiNotar issued digital certificates to secure digital communication, but as a result of the breach the <b>authenticity</b> of such <b>certificates</b> could no longer be verified. The Dutch government subsequently revoked its trust in all certificates issued by DigiNotar. This was the beginning of the first digital disaster in the Netherlands. As a pioneering disaster, this article focuses on the implications of DigiNotar as a vital case study for future scenarios of digital disaster management. The main focus of this article is on the underlying ‘weaknesses’ of the DigiNotar incident, which allowed the situation to evolve from a problem into a disaster. These include lack of oversight, lack of security attention and risk awareness and the absence of an effective mitigation strategy. By identifying and subsequently analyzing the underlying problems, this article aims to demonstrate how future situations can be better contained if sufficient attention is granted to these factors and subsequent changes are introduced...|$|R
