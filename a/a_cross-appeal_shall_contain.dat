50|$|At trial {{the action}} was {{dismissed}} and the counter-claim was allowed {{in the amount of}} $10,000. On appeal by Cropper to the Court of Appeal, the appeal was dismissed in so far as Peso's action was concerned. However, the Court of Appeal reduced Cropper's damages from $10,000 to $6,500.

50|$|The court held, further, that {{to allow}} the {{applications}} for the payment of interest would be effectively to vary {{the order of the}} court {{to the detriment of the}} appellant.

Furthermore, because the Act had come into operation on July 16, 1976,—that is, after the judgment in the court a quo—the relevant provision was inapplicable.

50|$|Tacoma and Jefferson {{appealed the}} in-stream flows {{requirement}} to the Washington Pollution Control Hearings Board (PCHB), who initially ruled in 1987 that the Department of Ecology had acted within its authority in placing the requirements {{in order to}} preserve the fisheries of the Dosewallips River. At a second hearing, the PCHB considered an argument from Tacoma and Jefferson alleging that the Department of Ecology had exceeded its authority in imposing the in-stream flows requirement to enhance the fishery, rather than maintain and preserve it. As a result, the flow rates were reversed by the board, leading to <b>a</b> <b>cross-appeal</b> in the Thurston County Superior Court. The court ruled in 1991 that the Department of Ecology had the authority to require an enhancement of the Dosewallips fisheries and re-instated their proposed flow rates.|$|R
