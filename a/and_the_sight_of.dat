5|$|The {{morning of}} the {{evacuation}} promised a perfect day. The sun rose out of a calm and sparkling sea and warmed the impassive cliffs of Oiseval. The sky was hopelessly blue <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Hirta, green and pleasant as the island of so many careless dreams, made parting all the more difficult. Observing tradition the islanders left an open Bible and a small pile of oats in each house, locked all the doors and at 7am boarded the Harebell. Although exhausted by the strain and hard work {{of the last few}} days, they were reported to have stayed cheerful throughout the operation. But as the long antler of Dun fell back onto the horizon and the familiar outline of the island grew faint, the severing of an ancient tie became a reality and the St Kildans gave way to tears.|$|E
5|$|With the Grande Armée in full retreat, another {{dangerous}} situation occurred on 29 October. With Bavaria now {{also in the}} camp of the Coalition, an Austro-Bavarian army of some 45,000 men, under General Karl Philipp von Wrede, who had fought {{under the command of}} the Emperor during the previous campaigns, tried to block the French retreat and delay the French force until the arrival {{of the rest of the}} Coalition forces. Wrede had the means necessary to achieve his goal, as he possessed a numerous artillery of about one hundred pieces and a powerful cavalry of 50 squadrons. In comparison, the French forces were much dispersed and only a few units remained cohesive and combat-capable. During the ensuing Battle of Hanau, Wrede placed his troops in front of the forest of Lamboi, through which he expected that the French would retreat. He also positioned almost all of his cavalry on the left, placing it under the command of Field Marshal-Lieutenant Spleny. Despite his numeric inferiority, Napoleon sent forward a part of his men against Bavarians deployed in the forest before him, but the intervention of the Foot Guards was soon required. The Bavarians had fought alongside the French in the past <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the fearsome Bearskins of French Guardsmen shook their morale and they abandoned their position in the forest after a brief fight. But, with the fire of a Bavarian grand battery upon them, the French infantry soon had to stop. Napoleon positioned General Le Noury's artillery in battery and brought in support General Drouot with the horse artillery of the Guard, as well as other pieces, constituting a grand battery of some 50 pieces that was soon able to respond adequately to the Austro-Bavarian cannonade. Nansouty, with the Guard Dragoons and Lancers, was instructed to protect this battery from the enemy and thus positioned his men behind the guns.|$|E

The future location of Memphis, Tennessee was shaken at Mercalli level nine intensity. A seismic seiche propagated upriver and Little Prairie was destroyed by liquefaction.

25|$|According {{to later}} reports from Santa Anna, the cavalry, under General Joaquín Ramírez y Sesma, were {{supposed}} to execute a surprise attack {{on the morning of}} February 23. Historian Thomas Ricks Lindley concluded that Sesma's troops had captured a Texian spy, Trinidad Coy, who lied about a Texian ambush further ahead, prompting Sesma to halt at 7 a.m. and wait for reinforcements. Historian Lon Tinkle speculated that the combination of the church bell ringing <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the two Texian scouts led Sesma to believe that the Texians were planning an assault on the cavalry.|$|E

The two had a lengthy discussion in the garden, and apparently Eric wanted something from Guillemette, but when he declined and turned {{to go back into the}} house, Eric shot him in the back, mortally wounding him. From 7:30a.m. onwards, Borel started shooting people at random. No one grew suspicious of his rifle until he started his rampage, since it was hunting season <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> rifles outside was to be expected.|$|E

When he returned, he found the Hobbits asleep, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Frodo sleeping nearly moved Gollum to repent. However, Sam woke up and spoke harshly to him, and the opportunity for redemption was lost. Gollum followed through with his plan and led Frodo and Sam into Shelob's Lair. There, Frodo was stung by the giant spider, taken prisoner by Orcs, and hauled to the Tower of Cirith Ungol.|$|E

500|$|The Allied {{retreat from}} Kokoda in August and September was a trying {{time for the}} carriers, who were pushed to their limit, hauling {{supplies}} up to the front, and then carrying the wounded back. Not only did it take eight men to move each casualty, but they moved far more slowly, taking three times as long to traverse the track. It was intended {{that there would be}} separate carrier lines for supply and casualty evacuation, but this could not be adhered to. Each non-walking casualty meant three fewer bundles of supplies delivered per day for each carrier employed evacuating wounded. By 30 August, all the carriers had been drafted into evacuating the wounded except those reserved for carrying the 3-inch mortars. [...] The retreat <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the wounded depressed the morale of the carriers, who repeatedly asked Kienzle why the Australians could not defeat the Japanese.|$|E

500|$|Bob Sassone of TV Squad {{felt that}} the best storyline was the one {{featuring}} Tracy and Jack because of the [...] "Bush/Iraq metaphors <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Alec Baldwin dressed as General MacArthur, standing beneath a 'Fun Accomplished' sign." [...] Robert Canning of IGN thought that the best storyline of the episode was centered on Liz and Jamie, and rated the episode 8 out of 10. Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide wrote that this episode [...] "had so many fun lines", and found himself [...] "giggling, chuckling and LOLing like a fool". He liked [...] "the 'cougars' storyline", saying it [...] "was a lot of fun, because Liz is best when Liz is feeling awkward." [...] Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Jenna's Amber Alert affair with the soda-drinking, Heelys-gliding teenager" [...] was [...] "priceless".

[...] Later in August 1782 the Queen sent Finch a lock of Alfred's hair stating [...] "Receive This ... as an Acknowledgement for Your very affectionate attendance upon my dear little Angel Alfred, and wear the inclosed Hair, not only in remembrance of that dear Object, {{but also as a}} mark of esteem from Your Affectionate Queen". Alfred was buried at Westminster Abbey, though his remains were later moved to the Royal Vault in St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle on 11 February 1820. His father continued to dwell on his death, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Alfred's posthumous portrait in a family painting by Thomas Gainsborough nearly a year after Alfred's death sent his three eldest sisters into tears. Six months after Alfred's death, his elder brother Octavius succumbed to the smallpox virus, further devastating the king. During one of his bouts of madness in 1812, George would have imaginary conversations with his two youngest sons.|$|E
