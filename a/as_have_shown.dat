6000|$|The {{first step}} to {{ensuring}} them is certainly to do all we can to discourage reckless parentage, and to render it improbable and difficult. We must make sure that whatever we do for the children, the burden of parental responsibility must not be lightened a feather- weight. All the experience of two hundred years of charity and poor law legislation sustains that. But to accept that as a first principle is one thing, and to apply it by using a wretched little child as our instrument in the exemplary punishment of its parent is another. At present that is our hideous practice. So long as the parents are not convicted criminals, {{so long as they}} do not practise indictable cruelty upon their offspring, so long as the children themselves fall short of criminality, we insist upon the parent [...] "keeping" [...] the child. It may be manifest the child is ill-fed, harshly treated, insufficiently clothed, dirty and living among surroundings harmful to body and soul alike, but we merely take the quivering damaged victim and point the moral to the parent. [...] "This is what comes of your recklessness," [...] we say. [...] "Aren't you ashamed of it?" [...] And after inscrutable meditations the fond parent usually answers us by sending out the child to beg or sell matches or by some equally effective retort. Now a great number of excellent people pretend that this is a dilemma. [...] "Take the child away," [...] it is argued, [...] "and you remove one of the chief obstacles to the reckless reproduction of the unfit. Leave it in the parents' hands and you must have the cruelty." [...] But really this is not a dilemma at all. There is a quite excellent middle way. It may not be within the sphere of practical politics at present--if not, it is work for the New Republic to get it there--but it would practically settle all this problem of neglected children. This way is simply to make the parent the debtor to society on account of the child for adequate food, clothing, and care for at least the first twelve or thirteen years of life, and in the event of parental default to invest the local authority with exceptional powers of recovery in this matter. It would be quite easy to set up a minimum standard of clothing, cleanliness, growth, nutrition and education, and provide, that if that standard was not maintained by a child, or if the child was found to be bruised or maimed without the parents being able to account for these injuries, the child should be at once removed from the parental care, and the parents charged with the cost of a suitable maintenance--which need not be excessively cheap. If the parents failed in the payments they could be put into celibate labour establishments to work off as much of the debt as they could, and they would not be released until their debt was fully discharged. Legislation of this type would not only secure all and more of the advantages children of the least desirable sort now get from charities and public institutions, but it would certainly invest parentage with a quite unprecedented gravity for the reckless, and it would enormously reduce the number of births of the least desirable sort. Into this net, for example, every habitual drunkard who was a parent would, for his own good and the world's, be almost certain to fall. [Footnote: Mr. C. G. Stuart Menteath has favored me with some valuable comments upon this point. He writes: [...] "I agree that calling such persons <b>as</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> themselves incapable of parental duties debtors to the State, would help to reconcile popular ideas of the 'liberty of the subject' with the enforcement as well as the passing of such laws. But the notions of drastically enforcing parental duties, and of discouraging and even prohibiting the marriages of those unable to show their ability to perform these duties, has long prevailed. See Nicholl's History of the Poor Law (1898, New Edition), i. 229, and ii. 140, 278, where you will find chargeable bastardy has been punishable in the first offence by one year's imprisonment, and in the second, by imprisonment until sureties are given, which thus might amount to imprisonment for life. See also, J. S. Mill, Political Economy, Bk. II., ch. ii., for extreme legislation on the Continent against the marriage of people unable to support a family. In Denmark there seem to be very severe laws impeding the marriage of those who have been paupers. The English law was sufficiently effective to produce infanticide, so that a law was passed making concealment of birth almost infanticide."] ...|$|E

That we may then all unite in rendering unto him our sincere and humble thanks, for his kind care and protection of the People of this Country previous to their becoming a Nation, for the signal and manifold mercies, and the favorable interpositions of his providence, which we experienced in the course and conclusion of the late war, for the great degree of tranquility, union, and plenty, which we have since enjoyed, for the peaceable and rational manner, in which we have been enabled to establish constitutions of government for our safety and happiness, and particularly the national One now lately instituted, for the civil and religious liberty with which we are blessed; and the means we have of acquiring and diffusing useful knowledge; and in general for all the great and various favors which he hath been pleased to confer upon us.And also that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations and beseech him to pardon our national and other transgressions, to enable us all, whether in public or private stations, to perform our several and relative duties properly and punctually, to render our national government a blessing to all the people, by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed, to protect and guide all Sovereigns and Nations (especially such <b>as</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> kindness unto us) and to bless them with good government, peace, and concord. To promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue, and the encrease of science among them and Us, and generally to grant unto all Mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as he alone knows to be best.Given under my hand at the City of New York the third day of October in the year of our Lord 1789.|$|E

Studies on the relation between TNF-α SNPs and <b>AS</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> controversial results.

In contrast, Vargas-Alarcón et al. (2006) and Shiau et al. (2007) showed an association of − 308 G/A polymorphism with susceptibility to AS.

40|$|The main {{scope of}} this article is to discuss the human-nature {{relationship}} and the influence of outdoor learning on this relation. Nature is conceived in today’s society as opposition of culture and <b>as</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> researchers people don’t see themselves as a part of the nature when they have to define nature. As a result of the propaganda of different green movements and the instructions from teachers and forest guards, youngsters consider the right behaviour in the forests as follows- no walking on the grass and off the official forest paths, no picking flowers etc. They consider environmental protection very important, but at the same time they are not sure what it is. There is a gap between knowledge and action. The rules that forbid free exploring in the wilderness are reinforcing the alienation from nature. As a result of alienation children don’t have a clue how and what the things that surround them are made of and where do they come from have shown several sociological studies made in Germany by natural sociologists. One interesting result of these studies is the fact that children who spend more time outside have similar idea of nature as have the others who have had less personal contact with nature. This shows that alienation from nature exist also on theoretical level as a product of nowadays society.

40|$|Forecasts of {{financial}} time series requires {{the use of}} a possibly large set of input (explanatory) variables drawn form a very large set of potential inputs. Selection of a meaningful and useful subset of input variables is a formidable task. How to find a reasonable transformation for a large set of multivariate data is a very common problem in many areas of science. We propose to use a technique called Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to extract the independent components (ICs) from monthly time series {{on a wide range of}} economic variables. This procedure will reduce the number of explanatory variables by reducing the set {{of financial}} and economic information to a much smaller subset of ICs which hopefully will capture most of the useful information. Removal of the random elements in each of the sets of economic data should make it much easier to identify relationships between the ICs and the stock indexes. Properly estimated ICs are independent of each other. We will then use the ICs from the explanatory variable data sets to perform and test forecasts of the S & P 500 stock index using neural network procedures. Numerous studies such <b>as</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> neural networks to be very useful in nonlinear forecasting. IC analysis has been employed in relatively few applications to finance. Kiviluoto and Oja (1998) use IC analysis in an application to parallel cash flow time series. Black and Weigand (1997) use IC analysis to extract estimates of the structure from a set of common stock returns. We feel that this research will contribute to the identification and understanding of the major economic factors affecting stock prices...|$|E

40|$|Arcus AS, a Norwegian {{subsidiary}} of Arcus Gruppen <b>AS</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> {{their interest in}} the English spirit market. Arcus AS offers different products of wine and spirits, {{and is the only}} company in Norway who officially has an approved laboratory for the analysis of wines and spirits. The product Arcus are interested in launching in England is Linie Aquavit. They have previously tried to launch their aquavit, but without success. A group of five students at Leeds Metropolitan University has worked with this report regarding the spirit market in England. The aim and objectives was to examine the English spirit market with focus on market trends, identifying possible external influences, and the positioning of Linie Aquavit in England. The report consists of primary and secondary data, where primary data was conducted through in-depth interviews with bartenders and bar owners and questionnaires handed out to the consumers at pubs, bars and restaurants. The data was collected in Leeds, Liverpool, Newcastle and Birmingham. In addition, an e-mail was sent to different distributors in England, to find different options regarding entering the English spirit market. The secondary data consists of web pages, articles, reports, journals and appropriate literature. The primary and secondary data has been analysed, and the authors have developed strategic options and recommendations that Arcus can find useful if entering the market. The findings of the analysis show that the English spirit market {{is one of the largest}} in the world. The on-trade market has decreased the recent years, while the off-trade market has been slightly increasing. The overall spirit market has decreased, and some of the reasons are the economic recession and public health campaigns. Political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal factors could influence a possible entry to the English spirit market. The authors have found that England has a well-established drinking culture, and that there is a market for Linie Aquavit. They would advise Arcus to enter the on and off trade market, and position themselves as a luxury brand to maintain their reputation as exclusive. Linie Aquavit should be sold in high-end bars and restaurant and exclusive stores...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of HLA alleles in B 27 negative AS and Reiter's syndrome patients is reviewed. Some groups have reported an increased incidence of B 7 -CREG antigens (B 7, B 22 and B 40) in B 27 negative Caucasian AS patients, {{but we could}} not confirm these results, although an increased incidence of B 7 was found in our B 27 negative American Black patients with AS. Studies with larger numbers of B 27 negative AS patients of various racial groups are needed to establish clearly {{if there is an}} association with B 7 -CREG antigens. KEY WORDS: Ankylosing spondylitis, HLA-B 27, HLA-B 7 -CREG. THE striking association between primary ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and HLA-B 27 (1, 2) implies that the disease association is either {{a direct result of the}} MHC gene product or an indirect result due to linkage disequilibrium between the B 27 gene and a second gene or group of genes (3). Many observations favour a direct role for B 27 (or a possible subset or epitope of B 27) in disease develop-ment. For example, if the presumed susceptibility gene were not B 27, but a gene at a closely linked locus, then in most instances the B 27 negative patient should have clinically the same disease that B- 27 positive patients suffer from, based on the same AS gene (3, 4). But studies of B 27 positive and negative patients with primary <b>AS</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> certain differences between these two subgroups, such as a significantly greater incidence of acute anterior uveitis in B 27 positive patients (5, 6), and a somewhat later age of onset (8 - 10) and relative lack of familial disease aggregation among B 27 negative patients (4. 7, 9). There is relatively little evidence at present to support the suggestion that the observed association of AS with B 27 is due to strong linkage disequilibrium between a putative AS gene(s) and the gene encoding for B 27. Studies of different racial groups can be helpful in further clarifying the role played by HLA antigens in disease pathogenesis. and for elucidating possible variations which may be related to different genetic and nongenetic aetiological factors. For example, our studies of Black patients have shown that about 50 % of patients with primary AS lack B 27 (11). When we studied unrelated B 27 negative Black patients with AS, HLA-B 7 was found to be present in 10 of the 18 patients (55. 6 %), HLA-...|$|E
