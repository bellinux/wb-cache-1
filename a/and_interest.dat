40|$|Social {{movements}} at {{all levels}} of their organization are mobilized because of the need to articulate its values <b>and</b> <b>interests</b> in the social and political arena. It is established, that the nature of interactions within the social movements are reflected in the axiological dimension in a form of self-organized groups as a functional part of a civil society. Through that their social potential reveals, especially in the context of social changes and rising tension between value conflicts of the unmet needs <b>and</b> <b>interests.</b> In such circumstances appropriate self-organized structures are able to provide its activities with relevant organizational, social, economic and political resources. Moreover, self-organizational interactions start developing in conditions of openness in social system which is occurred in social movements. Axiological aspect of this kind of interaction is disclosed in the crossing values <b>and</b> <b>interests</b> of the communities and authorities’ answer to them. Therefore, civil society communicates with the public authorities, ensuring the livelihood of democratic society and its steady development.

As a benefit of the study, positions through which axiological dimension of self-organizational interactions are displayed were highlighted. Firstly, the identification of values <b>and</b> <b>interests.</b> Secondly, reflection of the importance of values <b>and</b> <b>interests.</b> Thirdly, harmonization of actors’ values <b>and</b> <b>interests,</b> converting them into group values.
