5|$|The {{specific}} epithet nidiformis {{is derived}} from the Latin terms nīdus 'nest' and forma 'shape' or 'form', hence 'nest shaped'. Lampas {{is derived from}} the Greek lampas/λαμπας 'torch'. Common names include ghost fungus and Australian glow fungus. Drummond reported that the local aborigines were fearful when shown the luminescent fungus and called out chinga, a local word for spirit; Drummond himself likened it to a will-o'-the-wisp. Likewise on the Springbrook Plateau in southeastern Queensland, the local Kombumerri people believed the lights to be ancestors and gave the area <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>berth</b> out of respect.|$|E
5|$|Another classic bit {{of cinema}} {{that is largely}} a myth is the {{showdown}} at high noon, where two well-matched gunslingers agree to meet for a climactic formal duel. These duels did occasionally happen, {{as in the case}} of the Luke Short – Jim Courtright duel, but gunfights were typically more spontaneous, a fight that turned deadly when one side reached for a weapon, and no one knew who actually won the fight for several minutes until the air finally cleared of smoke. Gunfights could be won by simple distraction, or pistols could be emptied as gunmen fought from behind cover without injury. When a gunman did square off, it rarely was with another gunfighter. Gunslingers usually gave each other <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>berth,</b> and it was uncommon for two well-known gunslingers to face off. The gunslinger's reputation often was as valuable as any skills possessed. In Western films and books, young toughs often challenge experienced gunmen with the hopes of building a reputation, but this rarely happened in real life. A strong reputation was enough to keep others civil and often would spare a gunfighter from conflict. Even other gunslingers were likely to avoid any unnecessary confrontation.|$|E
25|$|Akari is a {{homeroom}} {{teacher of}} class of 2-A and a chemistry teacher. She is friendly with girl students, but she gives <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>berth</b> to boy students {{because she has}} a phobia about male. She appears in the Tsuyokiss Nigakki and Tsuyokiss Sangakki.|$|E

But by the better luck for me, he knew nothing, thought all was covered, and lied on in the dark.|$|R
25|$|For 17 months, {{the fort}} {{was able to}} harass French {{shipping}} trying to enter Fort-de-France. The guns on the rock completely dominated the channel {{between it and the}} main island, and because of their elevation, were able to fire far out to sea and forced vessels to give it <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>berth,</b> with the result that the currents and strong winds would make it impossible for them to fetch in Port Royal. During this time the French troops on Martinique made several unsuccessful attempts to retake the rock.|$|E
25|$|Cougars {{generally}} {{give the}} bears <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>berth.</b> Grizzlies have less competition with cougars than with other predators, such as coyotes, wolves, and other bears. When a grizzly descends on a cougar feeding on its kill, the cougar usually {{gives way to}} the bear. When a cougar does stand its ground, it will use its superior agility and its claws to harass the bear, yet stay out of its reach until one of them gives up. Grizzly bears occasionally kill cougars in disputes over kills. There have been several accounts, primarily from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, of cougars and grizzly bears killing each other in fights to the death.|$|E
25|$|Watford {{remained}} an agricultural community with some cottage industry for many centuries. The Industrial Revolution brought the Grand Junction Canal (now Grand Union Canal) from 1798 and the London and Birmingham Railway from 1837, both located {{here for the}} same reasons the road had followed centuries before, seeking an easy gradient over the Chiltern Hills. The land-owning interests permitted the canal to follow closely by the river Gade, but the prospect of smoke-emitting steam trains drove them to ensure the railway gave <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>berth</b> to the Cassiobury and Grove estates. Consequently, although the road and canal follow the easier valley route, the railway company was forced to build an expensive tunnel under Leavesden {{to the north of the}} town.|$|E

60|$|Twined {{in a great}} {{tree was}} Histah, the snake--huge, ponderous, slimy--and {{in the folds of}} its deadly embrace was Teeka's little balu, Gazan. Nothing in the jungle {{inspired}} within the breast of Tarzan so near a semblance to fear as did the hideous Histah. The apes, too, loathed the terrifying reptile and feared him even more than they did Sheeta, the panther, or Numa, the lion. Of all their enemies there was none they gave <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>berth</b> than they gave Histah, the snake.|$|R
60|$|Tarzan {{had been}} wont to {{traverse}} the Rue Maule {{on his way}} home at night. Because it was very quiet and very dark it reminded him more of his beloved African jungle than did the noisy and garish streets surrounding it. If you are familiar with your Paris you will recall the narrow, forbidding precincts of the Rue Maule. If you are not, you need but ask the police about it to learn that in all Paris there is no street to which you should give <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>berth</b> after dark.|$|R
25|$|In episode 1, Kat, Alfie and Tommy {{arrive in}} the Irish town of Redwater, where Kat is almost {{immediately}} convinced that Andrew Kelly (Peter Campion) is her son, while Andrew's grandmother, Agnes Byrne (Fionnula Flanagan) is suspicious of her. Alfie warns Kat {{to wait for the}} right time and make friends first, but Kat confides in Agnes's husband, Lance Byrne (Ian McElhinney), that her son was taken away from her in 1983 and she believes he is in Redwater. Lance tells Agnes this, and Agnes immediately says Kat should not be told the truth as it would unravel everything they have built. Kat visits the Byrnes' farm and talks to Andrew about his life, but then Lance warns him to give the Moons <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>berth.</b> Kat then admits to Alfie that she is scared of seeing how disappointed her son would be in her. Lance tells the local priest, Dermott Dolan (Oisín Stack), that Kat is his real mother. It is revealed that Iris Dolan (Orla Hannon) lost a baby in London and brought Dermott back as her own, and her husband, Peter Dolan (Stanley Townsend) does not know the truth. The next day, Dermott murders Lance by drowning him.|$|E
25|$|Bengal tigers {{occasionally}} prey on sloth bears. Tigers usually give sloth bears <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>berth,</b> {{though some}} specimens may become habitual bear killers {{and it is}} not uncommon to find sloth bear fur in tiger scats. Tigers typically hunt sloth bears by waiting for them near termite mounds, then creeping behind them and seizing them by the back of their necks and forcing them to the ground with their weight. One tiger was reported to simply break its victim's back with its paw, then wait for the paralysed bear to exhaust itself trying to escape before going in for the kill. When confronted by tigers face to face, sloth bears charge at them, crying loudly. A young or already sated tiger usually retreats from an assertive sloth bear, as the bear's claws can inflict serious wounds, and most tigers end the hunt if the bears become aware of the tiger's presence before the pounce. A female bear with cubs was observed to stand her ground and prevail in a confrontation against two tigers (one female, one male) in rapid succession. Sloth bears may scavenge on tiger kills. As tigers are known to mimic the calls of sambar deer to attract them, sloth bears react fearfully even to the sounds made by deer themselves. Indian leopards can also be a threat, as they are able to follow sloth bears up trees. Sloth bears occasionally chase leopards from their kills.|$|E
500|$|A {{new team}} led by David Lipman, Davis Doi, and Larry Houston {{finished}} twenty-six more for broadcast as a separate series named The New Jonny Quest. Time Warner's acquisition of Turner negated this plan, leading to the episodes' release as the second season of Real Adventures. Fred Seibert touted Quest as the [...] "Home Alone of adventure", with [...] "high-tech, multicultural themes" [...] that would appeal to contemporary youth. Promoters promised the new Quest would avoid [...] "mindless violence, chauvinism, xenophobia and insensitivity", addressing historical criticisms of the classic series. Turner also claimed that Quest would appeal to any gender, stating, [...] "Traditionally, action adventure animation may be stronger with boys, but in this case, storylines are being developed to draw girls in ... we're really hoping for <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>berth</b> of viewership." ...|$|E

They were all such miserable places that really, Jack, if I were you, I would give them <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>berth.</b> In every trap, {{somebody}} was sitting over a fire, waiting for Jack. Now, it was a crouching old woman, like the picture of the Norwood Gipsy in the old sixpenny dream-books; now, it was a crimp of the male sex, in a checked shirt and without a coat, reading a newspaper; now, it was a man crimp and a woman crimp, who always introduced themselves as united in holy matrimony; now, it was Jack's delight, his (un)lovely Nan; but they were all waiting for Jack, and were all frightfully disappointed to see us.|$|R

2500|$|The Navigation section {{changed the}} McMurdo {{waypoint}} co-ordinate {{stored in the}} ground computer system at approximately [...] {{on the morning of}} the flight. Crucially, the flight crew of Flight 901 was not notified of the change. The flight plan printout given to the crew {{on the morning of the}} flight, which was subsequently entered by them into the aircraft's INS, differed from the flight plan presented at the 9 November briefing and from Captain Collins' map mark-ups which he had prepared the night before the fatal flight. The key difference was that the flight plan presented at the briefing corresponded to a track down McMurdo Sound, giving Mount Erebus <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>berth</b> to the east, whereas the flight plan printed on the morning of the flight corresponded to a track that coincided with Mount Erebus, which would result in a collision with Mount Erebus if this leg was flown at an altitude of less than [...]|$|E
2500|$|At the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Army of Northern Virginia {{was faced}} with a serious threat by the Army of the Potomac and its new {{commanding}} general, Major General Joseph Hooker. General Lee decided to employ a risky tactic to take the initiative and offensive away from Hooker's new southern thrust – he decided to divide his forces. Jackson and his entire corps went on an aggressive flanking maneuver {{to the right of the}} Union lines: this flanking movement would be one of the most successful and dramatic of the war. While riding with his infantry in <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>berth</b> well south and west of the Federal line of battle, Jackson employed Maj. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry to provide for better reconnaissance regarding the exact location of the Union right and rear. The results were far better than even Jackson could have hoped. Fitzhugh Lee found the entire right side of the Federal lines in the middle of open field, guarded merely by two guns that faced westward, as well as the supplies and rear encampments. The men were eating and playing games in carefree fashion, completely unaware that an entire Confederate corps was less than a mile away. What happened next is given in Fitzhugh Lee's own words: ...|$|E

5000|$|Reviewing {{the series}} for Anime News Network, Theron Martin gave the North American Blu-ray release an overall grade of B, writing that [...] "if hyperviolent fare {{on the level}} of Elfen Lied, Ninja Scroll, or Hellsing Ultimate is beyond your {{tolerance}} range then give Corpse Party <b>a</b> <b>wide,</b> <b>wide</b> <b>berth.</b> If, however, you revel in such titles then this one is a must-see."

It took another two days before they were clear of the broken country, and the greater portion {{of this part of}} the journey they performed in daylight. Occasionally they saw, in the distance, the small forts which guarded every road to the plateau. To these they always gave <b>a</b> very <b>wide</b> <b>berth,</b> as although, according to the terms of peace, they should all have been evacuated, they might still be occupied by parties of Tippoo's troops.|$|R

60|$|The precipice {{was still}} in view, and before it several huge columns of rock appeared, {{detached}} from the mass behind. Two of these were particularly noticeable in the grey air--one vertical, stout and square; the other slender and tapering. They were individualized {{as husband and wife}} by the coast men. The waves leapt up their sides like a pack of hounds; this, however, though fearful in its boisterousness, was nothing to the terrible games that sometimes went on round the knees of those giants in stone. Yet it was sufficient to cause the course of the frail steamboat to be altered yet a little more--from south-west-by-south to south-by-west--to give the breakers <b>a</b> still <b>wider</b> <b>berth.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{spatial scale}} at which organisms respond to human {{activity}} can affect both ecological function and conservation planning. Yet {{little is known}} regarding the spatial scale at which distinct behaviors related to reproduction and survival are impacted by human interference. Here we provide a novel approach to estimating the spatial scale at which a top predator, the puma (Puma concolor), responds to human development when it is moving, feeding, communicating, and denning. We find that reproductive behaviors (communication and denning) require at least a 4 × larger buffer from human development than non-reproductive behaviors (movement and feeding). In addition, pumas give <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>berth</b> to types of human development that provide a more consistent source of human interference (neighborhoods) than they do to those in which human presence is more intermittent (arterial roads with speeds > 35 mph). Neighborhoods were a deterrent to pumas regardless of behavior, while arterial roads only deterred pumas when they were communicating and denning. Female pumas were less deterred by human development than males, but they showed larger variation in their responses overall. Our behaviorally explicit approach to modeling animal response to human activity {{can be used as}} a novel tool to assess habitat quality, identify wildlife corridors, and mitigate human-wildlife conflict...|$|R
2500|$|Despite criticisms that Gibson {{deliberately}} added {{additional material}} to the historical accounts of first-century Judea and biblical accounts of Christ's crucifixion, some scholars defend the film as not being primarily concerned with historical accuracy.

Gibson has been quoted as saying: [...] "I think that my first duty is to be as faithful as possible in telling the story so that it doesn't contradict the Scriptures.
