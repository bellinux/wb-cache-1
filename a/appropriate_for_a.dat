5|$|In September 1944, Nowotny {{was made}} {{commander}} of a specialist unit dubbed Kommando Nowotny, flying the newly developed Messerschmitt Me 262 out of airfields near Osnabrück. The unit {{not only had}} to contend with the enemy, but also with working through the 'teething' phase of the Me 262and developing the tactics <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> jet unit. On 7 October, Nowotny downed a B-24 Liberator bomber, his first aerial victory on the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary mission}} of a {{loitering}} munition is reaching the suspected target area, target acquisition during a loitering phase, {{followed by a}} suicide strike, and the munition is optimized in this regard in terms of characteristics (e.g. very short engine life time, silence in strike phase, speed of strike dive, optimization toward loitering time instead of range/speed) and unit cost (<b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> one-off strike mission).|$|E
5|$|Attention deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) is a mental disorder of the neurodevelopmental type. It is characterized by problems paying attention, excessive activity, or difficulty controlling behavior which is not <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> person's age. The symptoms appear before a person is twelve years old, are present {{for more than six}} months, and cause problems in at least two settings (such as school, home, or recreational activities). In children, problems paying attention may result in poor school performance. Although it causes impairment, particularly in modern society, many children with ADHD have a good attention span for tasks they find interesting.|$|E

5|$|The Augustan History {{contains}} {{details of}} Zenobia's early life, although their credibility is doubtful. According to Augustan History, the queen's hobby {{as a child}} was hunting. Apparently not a commoner, she would have received an education <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> noble Palmyrene girl. According to the Augustan History, {{in addition to her}} Palmyrene Aramaic mother tongue, Zenobia was reportedly fluent in Egyptian and Greek and spoke Latin. Around age 14 (c. 255) she became the second wife of Odaenathus, the ras (lord) of Palmyra.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish Parliament {{can give}} {{legislative}} consent over devolved matters {{back to the}} UK Parliament by passing a Legislative Consent Motion if United Kingdom-wide legislation is considered more <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> certain issue. The programmes of legislation enacted by the Scottish Parliament have seen a divergence {{in the provision of}} public services compared {{to the rest of the}} UK. For instance, university education and care services for the elderly are free at point of use in Scotland, while fees are paid in the rest of the UK. Scotland was the first country in the UK to ban smoking in enclosed public places.|$|E
5|$|On 26 July, {{the day of}} the ceremony, pilgrims {{spent the}} morning and early {{afternoon}} exploring the landscape of the memorial park before congregating at the monument. For the ceremony, sailors from HMCS Saguenay provided the guard of honour. Also present were The Royal Canadian Horse Artillery Band, French army engineers, and French-Moroccan cavalry who had fought on the site during the Second Battle of Artois. The ceremony itself was broadcast live by the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission over shortwave radio, with facilities of the British Broadcasting Corporation transmitting the ceremony to Canada. Senior Canadian, British, and European officials, including French President Albert Lebrun, and a crowd of over 50,000 attended the event. Absent, though, was Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, it being well understood that he was generally not comfortable around veterans and felt it more <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> war veteran in Cabinet to act as minister in attendance.|$|E

5|$|The AFL–CIO's {{autonomous}} {{support of}} Solidarity {{was so successful}} that by 1984 both Democrats and Republicans agreed that it deserved public support. The AFL–CIO's example of open support was deemed to be <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> democracy, and much more suitable than the clandestine funding through the CIA that had occurred before 1970. Both parties and President Ronald Reagan supported a non-governmental organization, National Endowment for Democracy (NED), through which Congress would openly fund Solidarity through an allocation in the State Department's budget, beginning in 1984. The NED was designed with four core institutions, associated with {{the two major parties}} and with the AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (representing business). The NED's first president was Carl Gershman, a former Director of Social Democrats, USA and former U.S. Representative to the United Nations committee on human rights. From 1984 until 1990, the NED and the AFL–CIO channeled equipment and support worth $4million to Solidarity.|$|E
