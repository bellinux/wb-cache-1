500|$|The Cardinals invited Molina {{to major}} league spring {{training}} camp following his draft.

[...] After allowing a passed ball through his legs with a runner on third base, Molina raced to the backstop to retrieve the ball. [...] Still hoping to prevent the runner from scoring, he instead found Ricketts in the golf cart parked on top of home plate. [...] Ricketts {{had a reputation for}} becoming upset when minor league catchers allowed balls to bounce between their legs; for this, he removed Molina from the game and drove him to the batting cage. [...] There, Ricketts batted 150 to 200 ground balls, as Molina estimated, to improve the young catcher's ability to block pitches.|$|E

He {{maintained}} {{an office in}} a Coast Guard station 300 yards from his home, at first taking <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> <b>cart</b> and later walking the route each day; he mainly worked on his memoirs. He had hoped to wait before writing his memoirs; {{the fact that his}} assets were being eaten away by expenses and lawyer fees compelled him to begin work quickly. He was handicapped in this work {{by the end of his}} transition allowance in February, which compelled him to part with many of his staff, including Ziegler. In August of that year, he met with British talk-show host and producer David Frost, who paid him $600,000 (...) for a series of sit-down interviews, filmed and aired in 1977. They began on the topic of foreign policy, recounting the leaders he had known, but the most remembered section of the interviews was that on Watergate. Nixon admitted that he had [...] "let down the country" [...] and that [...] "I brought myself down. I gave them a sword and they stuck it in. And they twisted it with relish. And, I guess, if I'd been in their position, I'd have done the same thing."

500|$|Fuming, Sinatra began what The Los Angeles Times {{describes}} as a [...] "weekend-long tirade" [...] against the [...] "hotel's management, employees and security forces". The FBI report says the incident began when Mia Farrow lost US$20,000 at the Sands casino. Sinatra bought US$50,000 in chips and made an attempt to win the money back. [...] He lost this sum within {{a short period of}} time. [...] Sinatra then asked for credit, which was denied. It culminated when Sinatra reportedly drove <b>a</b> <b>golf</b> <b>cart</b> through the window of the coffee shop where casino manager Carl Cohen was seated and began [...] "screaming obscenities and anti-Semitic remarks" [...] at Cohen. Sinatra reportedly punched Cohen, a heavily built man, who responded with a smack in the mouth, bloodying Sinatra's nose and knocking two of his teeth out. [...] As a result, Sinatra never performed at the Sands again while Hughes owned it, and began performing at Caesars Palace. A number of the staff were not disappointed to see Sinatra leave the Sands. Numerous employees had been humiliated or intimidated over the years, including a busboy Sinatra tripped while he was carrying a tray with dishes. After Sinatra left, the mobsters pulled out of the Sands and gradually left Vegas in the 1970s. [...] In the 1970s it became associated with the likes of Wayne Newton and Liberace. At this time some 30% of the performers at Sands were Italian Americans. Frank Gagliardi became the drummer for the house orchestra in 1964, starting a twelve-year tenure.|$|E
