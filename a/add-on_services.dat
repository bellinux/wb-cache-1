50|$|The {{line between}} vanity {{publishing}} and traditional publishing {{has become increasingly}} blurred {{in the past few}} years. Currently there are several companies that offer digital and/or print publication with no up front cost. However, most of these companies also offer <b>add-on</b> <b>services</b> such as editing, marketing and cover design. Self-publishing companies that fit this model include CreateSpace (owned by Amazon.com), iUniverse, and Lulu. An author who simply hands a book over to one of these companies, expecting the company to make it a bestseller, would meet the previously established definition of vanity publishing, but it's unclear how many authors fit this description. Further blurring the distinction between self-publishing and traditional publishing was Penguin's 2012 purchase of Author Solutions.|$|E
