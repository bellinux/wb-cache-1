In this location, skills can be assigned, weapons can be traded, purchased, and forged, and bonus experience points earned in battle can be given to characters. There is also <b>a</b> <b>Support</b> <b>system</b> accessible through the Base where player characters can talk {{with each other and}} improve their relationships.

5|$|Each {{unit has}} their own {{character}} class, with that class determining a unit's range of movement, weapon, and strengths and weaknesses. Classes range from on-foot units like swordsmen and knights, mounted units such as the series' recurring Pegasus Knights, and magic-wielding units such as Mages. Each class also has its own battle animation. Upon performing an action in battle, characters are awarded by experience points (EXP). Upon gathering enough EXP, the character levels up, and its statistics such as defense and critical strike rate are raised randomly. Using special items, a unit's class can be evolved into an Advanced Class, changing their class and altering their statistics. <b>A</b> <b>Support</b> <b>system</b> exists where characters who remain {{next to each other}} for a number of turns talk to each other, gaining Support Points and earning stat boosts. A limit is placed on the number of Support Points that can be earned when completing a single map.|$|E

The most common ceramics that need consolidation are excavated pieces because they tend to have lost their bonding fabrics due to leeching or have absorbed soluble salts. A consolidant works in two ways: it either links to the particles in the ceramic chemically or it may form <b>a</b> <b>support</b> <b>system</b> mechanically without reacting with the fabric itself. Chemical consolidants that are used in modern conservation include isocyanates, silanes, siloxnes, and methyl methacrylates, however the consolidants that create a mechanical support system are used more frequently.|$|E

25|$|During childhood, {{siblings}} are {{a source}} of conflict and frustration as well as <b>a</b> <b>support</b> <b>system.</b> Adolescence may affect this relationship differently, depending on sibling gender. In same-sex sibling pairs, intimacy increases during early adolescence, then remains stable. Mixed-sex siblings pairs act differently; siblings drift apart during early adolescent years, but experience an increase in intimacy starting at middle adolescence. Sibling interactions are children's first relational experiences, the ones that shape their social and self-understanding for life. Sustaining positive sibling relations can assist adolescents in a number of ways. Siblings are able to act as peers, and may increase one another's sociability and feelings of self-worth. Older siblings can give guidance to younger siblings, although the impact of this can be either positive or negative depending on the activity of the older sibling.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} ways used to treat loneliness, social isolation, and clinical depression. The first step that most doctors recommend to patients is therapy. Therapy is a common and effective way of treating loneliness and is often successful. Short term therapy, {{the most common form}} for lonely or depressed patients, typically occurs over a period of ten to twenty weeks. During therapy, emphasis is put on understanding the cause of the problem, reversing the negative thoughts, feelings, and attitudes resulting from the problem, and exploring ways to help the patient feel connected. Some doctors also recommend group therapy as a means to connect with other sufferers and establish <b>a</b> <b>support</b> <b>system.</b> Doctors also frequently prescribe anti-depressants to patients as a stand-alone treatment, or in conjunction with therapy. It may take several attempts before a suitable anti-depressant medication is found. Some patients may also develop a resistance to a certain type of medication and need to switch periodically.|$|E

40|$|Models are {{essential}} in <b>a</b> decision <b>support</b> <b>system</b> for river basin management. In <b>a</b> decision <b>support</b> <b>system</b> for integrated planning and management, {{the use of}} appropriate models is important to avoid models being either too simple or too complex. In this paper, appropriate models refer to models that are good-enough-but-not-more-than-that to obtain an acceptable ranking of river engineering measures under uncertainty. A systematic approach called `appropriateness framework' is proposed to determine appropriate models {{that can be used}} in <b>a</b> decision <b>support</b> <b>system.</b> The approach is applied to <b>a</b> decision <b>support</b> <b>system</b> for the Dutch Meuse River. One important component of this decision <b>support</b> <b>system,</b> flood safety, is used in this paper to demonstrate how this approach works. The results show that the approach is very useful in helping to determine appropriate models. Potential applications of the approach in other decision <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> are discussed. The approach presented in this paper is designed as a tool to stimulate the communication between decision makers and modelers and to promote the use of models in decision-making for river basin management.

For such people, it is possible that <b>a</b> decision <b>support</b> <b>system</b> tailored to their own individual way of working can help them in their decision making tasks. Decision makers in such environments can be viewed as using naturalistic decision making methods, and cognitive models of such people performing a simulated elec-tronic warfare task have been implemented using the Soar architecture, for inclusion in <b>a</b> decision <b>support</b> <b>system.</b> This task was chosen because it displays the characteris-tics most relevant to naturalistic decision making, namely rapid decision making in complex, real-time environments.
