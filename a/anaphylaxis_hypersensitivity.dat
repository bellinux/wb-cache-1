This work examines the pharmacological modulation of several mediators involved in rat hind paw immune oedema induced by OVA. Wistar rats were previously immunized (14 - 18 days) with OVA (30 microg, intraperitoneally) or sham-sensitized with aluminum hydroxide (control). The paw volumes were measured before the antigenic stimuli and 1, 2, 3 and 4 h after the intraplantar injection of OVA (10 microg/paw). Subcutaneous injection of dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, cyproheptadine, chlorpromazine or methysergide significantly inhibited (p < 0. 05) the allergic paw oedema. The dual inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase (NDGA), the cyclooxygenase inhibitor (indomethacin), the lipoxygenase inhibitor (MK- 886), the PAF antagonist (WEB 2086), the mast cell stabilizer (ketotifen), and the anti-histamine (meclizine) did not inhibit the immune oedema. In addition, thalidomide and pentoxifylline (anti-tumour necrosis factor drugs) were ineffective against OVA-induced oedema. The fact that indomethacin, MK- 886, NDGA and WEB 2086 are unable to inhibit this allergic oedema indicates that the dexamethasone action seems not to be via phospholipase A 2, but possibly due to the synthesis and/or the inhibitory activity of cytokines. The paw oedema inhibition by diphenhydramine, but not by meclizine, may suggest a different mechanism, which is independent of the effect of histamine. These data indicate that allergic oedema is more sensitive to anti-serotonin drugs, mainly anti- 5 -HT 2, suggesting that the principal mediator of this inflammatory response is serotonin...|$|E
40|$|As reações alérgicas ao látex vêm aumentando em profissionais da saúde e se manifestam como um incômodo local ou sintomatologia sistêmica. Para conhecer a freqüência das manifestações alérgicas nos usuários de luvas de látex foi realizada busca entre os profissionais da odontologia via aplicação de questionários. Foram aplicados 450 questionários e, dentre os respondedores (140), 19 % relataram manifestar reações locais ao contato com as luvas de látex e 5 % reações sistêmicas a outros produtos de látex. Cerca de 2, 5 % declararam dermatite de contato e reações sistêmicas (anafiláticas), 1, 5 % apenas dermatite de contato e 1 % sintomas de anafilaxia ao uso das luvas. Vinte por cento dos profissionais atenderam pacientes com alergia ao látex e 29 % declararam questionar, durante a anamnese, a respeito de alergia ao látex. As reações alérgicas a luvas de látex foram freqüentes e é objeto de preocupação entre os profissionais da odontologia.

40|$|The {{response}} to passive cutaneous <b>anaphylaxis,</b> dermal <b>hypersensitivity</b> and intravenous provocation tests {{has been compared}} in 30, 40, 31 and 24 cattle injected with foot-and-mouth disease vaccine 0, 1, 2 and 3 times respectively, using vaccine components and other substances as test materials. Reaginic antibodies demonstrated by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in goats, were directed against BHK 21 cell extracts (20), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (3) and an unidentified vaccine component (3), and distributed in 0, 5, 19 and 75 per cent of the cattle vaccinated 0, 1, 2 and 3 times. None of the animals showed clinical signs of allergy after vaccination. When BHK 21 cell extract was injected intradermally a significant correlation was noted between the development of large weals {{and the presence of}} reagins although the size of the weals was not correlated with the reagin titres. In the case of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose a similar trend was evident. The majority of cattle with large dermal weals possessed reagins but the number of reactions was too small for statistical evaluation. Dermal reactions to sodium penicillin, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, saponin and whole vaccine occurred in both unvaccinated and vaccinated cattle but BHK 21 cell lysate and normal bovine serum provoked weals which increased in frequency according to the number of vaccinations experienced. Intravenous hydroxypropylmethylcellulose elicited a response in all the animals previously injected with certain batches of vaccine but cell extract intravenously produced a clinical response in half the tested animals which was uncorrelated with the results of the passive cutaneous <b>anaphylaxis</b> or dermal <b>hypersensitivity</b> tests...|$|R

The antigenicity of a linear homopolymer, poly-L-proline, has been demonstrated in guinea-pigs.

40|$|Adverse drug {{reactions}} {{are a common}} medical problem.

Clinical manifestations of the skin comprise manifold appearances from mild macular exanthems to bullous eruptions, and urticaria, angioedema to <b>anaphylaxis.</b> Systemic <b>hypersensitivity</b> reactions can affect nearly all internal organs and cells. Characteristic clinical danger signs for severe allergic drug reactions, for immediate type {{as well as for}} delayed type manifestations, help to recognise the incipient allergic drug reaction, to stop the further administration of the potential elicitor/allergen and to start therapeutic actions. It is essential for the success of a further allergologic work-up of such reactions to describe and document accurately the morphologic characteristics of the skin and other organ manifestations and the exact time course of medication intake and development of the clinical adverse reaction. This facilitates the choice of adequate diagnostic measures and the interpretation of the respective results...|$|R
30|$|Fexofenadine HCl (FFN) is a second-generation nonsedating {{histamine}} H 1 receptor antagonist extensively used in seasonal allergic rhinitis. The usual dose {{for adults}} is 60  mg two {{times a day}} or 180  mg once a day. The half life of the drug is 14.4  h and the oral bioavailability is 30 – 41  % (Product Information: Allegra reviewed 1 / 2000). The adverse effect {{was reported to be}} <b>anaphylaxis</b> and <b>hypersensitivity</b> reactions (Product Information: Allegra reviewed 10 / 2001). As it is under the class III of the biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS), polymers can be used to prolong its duration of action in body, thereby increasing the bioavailability. Thus to increase the bioavailability by sustaining the action and to reduce the frequency of administration, to lessen adverse effects and to improve patient compliance, a controlled release formulation of the drug is required. Some extended release matrix tablets of Fexofenadine HCl are available in the market, but microspheres offer more consistent drug distribution and reduced dose dumping compared to matrix tablets.|$|R

Pretreatment with DNP-BSA or with HGG were found to modify, in opposite directions, the hypersensitivity reactions induced by DNP-HGG in adjuvant. It is suggested that the hapten and carrier moieties of the antigen molecule might have antagonistic effects on the T cells responsible for cellular immunity {{as well as on}} T cells involved in helper functions for B cells...|$|R

40|$|Blistering drug eruptions and drug-induced <b>anaphylaxis</b> and <b>hypersensitivity</b> syndromes {{are among}} the most serious types of adverse drug reactions. We report a 69 old female patient who was using {{multiple}} medications and presented with a two month history of recurrent blisters, pustules and crusts. The patient was evaluated by a dermatologist, and biopsies for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) examination, as well as for direct immunofluorescence (DIF) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed. The H&E examination revealed a subepidermal blister with numerous luminal eosinophils, as well as a dermal superficial and deep, perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes and eosinophils. The DIF revealed a linear positive staining on the subepidermal interior of the blister with IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, Complement/C 4, lambda light chains, fibrinogen, and albumin; staining was noted in the basement membrane zone, and also focally present around dermal blood vessels and eccrine glands. The dermal staining colocalized with anti-p 0071 (Plakophilin 4). We also observed overexpression of thrombomodulin in adjacent epidermal keratinocytes, {{as well as in the}} upper dermal blood vessels; its presence may be linked to mitigation of inflammation. With the increased medications that many patients are taking orally and are using topically, overall drug reaction patterns seem to be more complex than previously described...|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcal {{enterotoxin}} B (SEB) toxoid-containing microspheres {{were tested}} for efficacy in rhesus monkeys as a vaccine candidate for respiratory SEB toxicosis and toxic shock. Forty monkeys were randomly separated into 10 {{groups of four}} monkeys each: 9 groups were vaccinated with the microspheres via combinations of mucosal and nonmucosal routes, and 1 group served as nonvaccinated controls. Both vaccinated and nonvaccinated monkeys were then challenged with a high lethal dose of SEB aerosol. Monkeys primed with an intramuscular dose of the microspheres followed by an intratracheal booster all survived the SEB challenge. Overall, monkeys with an intratracheal booster generally had the highest antibody levels, {{which is consistent with}} their high survival rate and lower rate of illness. Protective immunity was correlated with antibody levels in both the circulation and the respiratory tract. The protection was not due to the depletion or anergy of SEB-reactive T cells, since SEB-induced proliferation in cultures of circulating lymphocytes was not significantly reduced after the microsphere vaccination. It is evident that the nonsurvivors did not die of systemic <b>anaphylaxis</b> or <b>hypersensitivity</b> because the monkeys did not die immediately after SEB challenge and {{there were no significant differences}} in histamine levels between the vaccinated and control monkeys before and after SEB challenge. The antibodies seemed to neutralize the SEB that got into the airway and the circulation...|$|R

40|$|Basophils {{represent}} {{less than}} 1 % of pe-ripheral blood leukocytes and {{have often been}} considered as minor and possibly redundant circulating mast cells. The re-cent finding that basophils readily gener-ate large quantities of T helper 2 (Th 2) cytokines such as IL- 4 provided new in-sights into the possible role of basophils in allergic disorders and immunity to pathogens. However, in-depth studies on basophils, particularly their functions in vivo, have been hampered {{by the lack of}} appropriate animal models, such as mu-tant animals deficient only in basophils. Here, we established a mAb that reacted with mouse basophils and depleted them when administered in vivo. The mAb treat-ment of mice did not show any significant effect on classical allergic reactions such as passive cutaneous <b>anaphylaxis</b> and contact <b>hypersensitivity.</b> In contrast, it completely abolished the development of IgE-mediated chronic allergic dermatitis that is characterized by massive eosino-phil infiltration, even though basophils accounted for only approximately 2 % of the infiltrates. The treatment during the progression of the dermatitis resulted in drastic reduction in numbers of infiltrat-ing eosinophils and neutrophils, concomi-tantly with elimination of basophils from the skin lesions. Thus, basophils play a pivotal {{role in the development of}} IgE-mediated chronic allergic inflammation, as an initiator rather than as an effector...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial L-asparaginases (E. C. 3. 5. 1. 1) are {{enzymes that}} {{catalyze}} the hydrolysis of L-asparagine to aspartic acid. For the past 30 years these enzymes {{have been used}} as therapeutic agents in the treatment of acute childhood lymphoblastic leukemia. The presence of a low rate glutaminase activity however causes serious side-effects to patients in treatment, as glutamine depletion give rise to neurotoxicity, <b>anaphylaxis,</b> and other <b>hypersensitivity</b> reactions. The interest in the enzyme from Erwinia carotovora originates {{from the fact that it}} shows a decreased glutaminase activity, and therefore the enzyme is expected to exhibit fewer side effects when used in therapy. The main focus of this thesis is the crystal structure determination of L-asparaginase from Erwinia carotovora in the presence of aspartic acid at 2. 5 Å resolution. The structure was refined to an R/Rfree factor of 19. 9 / 28. 6 with good stereochemistry. L-Asparaginases are homotetrameric enzymes with a known 222 symmetry and an identical fold. The Erwinia carotovora asparaginase consists of eight monomers of 330 amino acid residues each. In this case the enzyme is active as a dimer of tetramers. The two tetramers have an inner twofold non-crystallographic symmetry. Each monomer forms two identifiable domains a large N-domain and a small C-domain. The active sites are found at a topological switch-point between those domains...|$|R
40|$|Drug allergy to {{antibiotics}} {{may occur}} {{in the form of}} immediate or non-immediate (delayed) hypersensitivity reactions. Immediate reactions are usually IgE-mediated whereas non-immediate hypersensitivity reactions are usually non-IgE or T-cell mediated. The clinical manifestations of antibiotic allergy may be cutaneous, organ-specific (e. g., blood dyscracias, hepatitis, interstitial nephritis), systemic (e. g., <b>anaphylaxis,</b> drug induced <b>hypersensitivity</b> syndrome) or various combinations of these. Severe cutaneous adverse reactions manifesting as Stevens Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) may be potentially life-threatening. The management of antibiotic allergy begins with the identification of the putative antibiotic from a detailed and accurate drug history, complemented by validated in-vivo and in-vitro allergological tests. This will facilitate avoidance of the putative antibiotic through patient education, use of drug alert cards, and electronic medical records with in-built drug allergy/adverse drug reaction prescription and dispensing checks. Knowledge of the evidence for specific antibiotic cross-reactivities is also important in patient education. Apart from withdrawal of the putative antibiotic, immunomodulatory agents like high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins may have a role in TEN. Drug desensitization where the benefits outweigh the risks, and where no alternative antibiotics can be used for various reasons, may be considered in certain situations. Allergological issues pertaining to electronic drug allergy alerts, computerized physician prescriptions and decision support systems, and antibiotic de-escalation in antimicrobial stewardship programmes are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background: Wheat is {{involved}} in different forms of respiratory, food and contact allergy. The IgE of patients generally reacts with various flour proteins. It is not known if antigenic relationships could explain some of these reactions and if proteins could be involved in different pathologies. Methods: Two sera were selected as representative of patients with either wheat-dependent exercise-induced <b>anaphylaxis</b> (WDEIA) or <b>hypersensitivity</b> to hydrolyzed wheat proteins (HHWP). Their IgE specificity was studied with wheat, barley and rye proteins, using immunoblot, and immunoblot inhibition with recombinant - 3 hordein. This protein was chosen for its cross-reactivity with - 5 gliadin, a major allergen in WDEIA. Results: The IgE from both sera strongly reacted with natural and recombinant - 3 hordein but displayed different patterns of reactivity with wheat, barley and rye proteins. Those from the WDEIA patient showed expected reactions with - 5 gliadin, - 35 and - 75 secalins, but also with wheat low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS), and not with C hordeins. On the contrary, IgE from a HHWP patient reacted with C hordeins, various gliadins, and - 75 secalin, but very weakly with - 35 secalin and LMW-GS. Recombinant - 3 hordein inhibited strongly but not totally the WDEIA patient's IgE binding to prolamins. No such inhibition could be observed for the HHWP patient's IgE. Conclusions: At {{least part of the}} reactions of prolamins with the IgE from the WDEIA patient was due to antigenic homologies. The occurrence of cross-reacting carbohydrates was unlikely. These common IgE epitopes were not involved in the pathology of the HHWP patient...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: A {{previous}} {{study showed that}} bee venom (BV) could cause <b>anaphylaxis</b> or other <b>hypersensitivity</b> reactions. Although hypersensitivity reactions due to sweet bee venom (SBV) have been reported, SBV {{has been reported to}} be associated with significantly reduced sensitization compared to BV. Although no systemic immediate hypersensitive response accompanied by abnormal vital signs has been reported with respect to SBV, we report a systemic immediate hypersensitive response that we experienced while trying to use SBV clinically. Methods: The patient had undergone BV treatment several times at other Oriental medicine clinics and had experienced no adverse reactions. She came to acupuncture & moxibustion department at Semyung university hospital of Oriental medicine (Je-cheon, Korea) complaining of facial hypoesthesia and was treated using SBV injections, her first SBV treatment. SBV, 0. 05 cc, was injected at each of 8 acupoints, for a total of 0. 40 cc: Jichang (ST 4), Daeyeong (ST 5), Hyeopgeo (ST 6), Hagwan (ST 7), Yepung (TE 17), Imun (TE 21), Cheonghoe (GB 2), and Gwallyeo (SI 18). Results: The patient showed systemic immediate hypersensitive reactions. The main symptoms were abdominal pain, nausea and perspiration, but common symptoms associated with hypersensitivity, such as edema, were mild. Abdominal pain was the most long-lasting symptom and was accompanied by nausea. Her body temperature decreased due to sweating. Her diastolic blood pressure could not be measured on three occasions. She remained alert, though the symptoms persisted. The following treatments were conducted in sequence; intramuscular epinephrine, 1 mg/mL, injection, intramuscular dexamethasone, 5 mg/mL, injection, intramuscular buscopan, 20 mg/mL, injection, oxygen (O 2) inhalation therapy, 1 L/minutes, via a nasal prong, and intravascular injection of normal saline, 1 L. After 12 hours of treatment, the symptoms had completely disappeared. Conclusion: This case shows that the use of SBV does not completely eliminate the possibility of hypersensitivity and that patients who received BV treatment before may also be sensitized to SBV. Thus, a skin test should be given prior to using SBV...|$|R
40|$|The Charles Richet and Jules Héricourt {{workshops}} {{honor the}} memory of Jules Héricourt (1850 – 1938) and Charles Richet (1850 – 1935) who described the principle of serotherapy in 1888 and made the very first attempts to fight cancer with serotherapy in 1895. In 1902, Charles Richet and Paul Portier described “anaphylaxis,” a discovery awarded the Nobel Prize in 1913. The first workshop, “Towards the clinical use of monoclonal antibodies with higher cytolytic efficacy in cancer” was held in Tours, France on November 20 – 21, 2008. The second Charles Richet and Jules Héricourt workshop, held May 31 –June 1, 2011 at the University of Tours, France, was also organized by the Cancéropôle Grand Ouest. The topic of the workshop was therapeutic antibodies and anaphylaxis, a subject rarely addressed in congresses focused on mAbs. To have discussions about mAb side effects with complete objectivity, the congress was organized independently of any sponsorship from pharmaceutical companies. This academic event was motivated by {{the high incidence of}} shocks to cetuximab and the need to compile and evaluate scattered information. This growing public health concern was thus analyzed from different scientific and medical angles. The first session was devoted to acute infusion reactions, with an emphasis on deconvolution of the terms “cytokine-release syndrome,” “cytokine storms,” “anaphylaxis” and their epidemiology. This session concluded with the Charles Richet lecture on cetuximab anaphylaxis and anti-αGal IgE by Thomas Platts-Mills, its discoverer. In the next session, the involvement of anti-glycan antibodies in both <b>anaphylaxis</b> and delayed <b>hypersensitivity</b> reactions to therapeutic antibodies was discussed. A gala dinner was held in the gardens of the beautiful château of Villandry, which was acquired and restored by Joachim Carvalho, a pupil of Charles Richet's and great-grandfather of the present owner. The final session focused on strategies to prevent cetuximab anaphylaxis in clinical practice included a variety of topics, e. g., premedication, biobetters and biosimilars, skin testing and predictive assays. All speakers and attendees enjoyed this very stimulating and rewarding meeting, which gathered many people with divergent scientific backgrounds and medical specialties...|$|R
