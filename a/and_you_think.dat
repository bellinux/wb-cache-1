25|$|I {{think every}} {{director}} {{thinks that he}} hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.|$|E

500|$|Celilo Falls retains great {{cultural}} {{significance for}} native peoples. Ted Strong of the Intertribal Fish Commission told one historian, [...] "If {{you are an}} Indian person <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> {{you can still see}} all the characteristics of that waterfall. If you listen, you can still hear its roar. If you inhale, the fragrances of mist and fish and water come back again." [...] In 2007, three thousand people gathered at Celilo Village to commemorate the 50-year anniversary of the inundation of the falls.|$|E
500|$|While {{the group}} were {{considering}} {{a replacement for}} Bayley, Rod Smallwood convinced Steve Harris to invite Bruce Dickinson back into the band. Although Harris admits that he [...] "wasn't really into it" [...] at first, he then thought, [...] "'Well, if the change happens, who should we get?' The thing is, we know Bruce {{and we know what}} he's capable of, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> 'Well, better the devil you know.'

[...] And you realize that the answer lies somewhere in a complex web of all kinds of stuff, like genetic make-up, upbringing, coincidences, choices you made along the way, missed opportunities, [...] lucky breaks." [...] She felt that it was a natural choice to centre on a relationship between two people, [...] "because relationships, and especially the romantic ones, play a huge role in shaping our lives, and also, obviously, in creating new ones." ...|$|E

500|$|The plane scene {{during which}} {{passengers}} die in mid-air was created inside {{a very large}} sound stage. The three-ton hydraulic gimbal was operated automatically. [...] "We spent two months building this central set piece that weighs about 45,000 pounds and holds 89 people," [...] special effects supervisor Terry Sonderhoff explained. Used for filming the on-board sequences, it could be shifted on the gimbal to create a pitching movement of up to 45 degrees side-to-side and 60 degrees front-to-back, realistically conveying the horror of airborne engine failure. [...] Sawa said that [...] "the screams of the cast inside the gimbal made it appear more real". [...] Wong said, [...] "You walk into the studio and there's a huge gimbal with a plane on top <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> 'What have I done?' I was afraid we were gonna have 40 extras vomiting." ...|$|E
500|$|Some vocalising by Lennon is faintly audible {{at the end}} of the song, {{picked up}} as leakage onto one of the drum {{microphones}} (close listening shows Lennon making other comments to Starr). In the [...] "Paul is Dead" [...] hoax these were taken to be Lennon saying [...] "I buried Paul." [...] In 1974, McCartney said, [...] "That wasn't 'I buried Paul' at all – that was John saying 'cranberry sauce' … That's John's humour … If you don't realise that John's apt to say cranberry sauce when he feels like it, then you start to hear a funny little word there, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> 'Aha!'" [...] Shortly before his death in 1980, Lennon expressed dissatisfaction with the final version of the song, saying it was [...] "badly recorded" [...] and accusing McCartney of subconsciously sabotaging the recording.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] {{talks about}} a scorned lover rediscovering their inner strength, with Madonna [...] "shooting a few poison arrows {{into the heart of}} some dude who's done her wrong," [...] as noted by Rolling Stone Rob Sheffield. During the song, she {{repeatedly}} labels an ex's bad behavior as [...] "bullshit" [...] and tells him, [...] "fuck you". In another part, she mocks, [...] "When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied." [...] In the chorus, she sings: [...] "It might sound like I’m an unapologetic bitch / but sometimes you know I gotta call I like it is." [...] The song was allegedly written about Madonna's ex-boyfriend Brahim Zaibat. She told Rolling Stone that the song [...] "it's like, fuck you, I'm going to have fun. You think you're going to ruin my life <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that it's over for me, but guess what? It's not. Life goes on." [...] While commenting to Billboard over the usage of the word [...] "bitch" [...] numerous times in two songs from the album, Madonna explained: ...|$|E

500|$|Harrison's {{version of}} [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] was an {{international}} number 1 {{hit by the}} end of 1970 and through the early months of 1971 – the first solo single by a Beatle to reach the top, and the biggest seller by any of the four throughout the 1970s. Without the support of any concert appearances or promotional interviews by Harrison, the single's commercial success was due to its impact on radio, where, Harrison biographer Gary Tillery writes, the song [...] "rolled across the airwaves like a juggernaut, with commanding presence, much the way Dylan's 'Like a Rolling Stone' had arrived in the mid-sixties". Elton John recalls first hearing [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] in a taxi and names it as the last of the era's great singles: [...] "I thought, 'Oh my God,' and I got chills. You know when a record starts on the radio, and it's great, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> 'Oh, what is this, what is this, what is this?' The only other record I ever felt that way about [...] was 'Brown Sugar'..." [...] In his 40-page Harrison tribute article for Rolling Stone in 2002, Mikal Gilmore credited [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] as being [...] "as pervasive on radio and in youth consciousness as anything the Beatles had produced".|$|E

The Home Secretary David Blunkett noted that celebration was tempting, saying: [...] "You wake up and you receive a call telling you Shipman has topped himself <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> is it too early to open a bottle? And then you discover that everybody's very upset that he's done it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Guitarist Trevor de Brauw {{stated that}} [...] "City of Echoes is moulded by the {{experience}} of touring—the title sort of refers to the feeling you get that, although {{you go to a}} lot of different places, one of the effects of globalisation is that you see so many similarities from city to city." [...] Speaking on, the band talks about how [...] "you start to see the spread of the Western world, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of current events and raging wars for oil, and you start to get hit with how wrong it is to see the golden arches everywhere".|$|E

2500|$|After the Iraq invasion, U.S. {{troops were}} {{criticized for not}} {{protecting}} the historical artifacts and treasures located at the National Museum of Iraq. When asked at the time why U.S. troops did not actively seek to stop the lawlessness, Rumsfeld replied, [...] "Stuff happens... and it's untidy and freedom's untidy, and free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and do bad things. They're also free {{to live their lives}} and do wonderful things. And that's what's going to happen here." [...] He further commented that, [...] "The images you are seeing on television you are seeing over, and over, and over, and it's the same picture of some person walking out of some building with a vase, and you see it 20 times, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> [...] "My goodness, were there that many vases?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Guardian {{released}} {{two separate}} reviews. Vicky Frost found the plane plot [...] "less compelling" [...] {{than the rest}} of the episode, though she [...] "particularly likes" [...] the idea of Dimitri and Erin breaking Harry out of CIA custody despite believing that this development rendered much of the fifth episode [...] "largely pointless." [...] Frost also praised Walker's performance as Ruth throughout the episode, but admitted to seeing her demise coming, though she felt the circumstances that led to Ruth's death [...] "did give the far more satisfying ending" [...] and the moments between Ruth and Harry were [...] "excellently done." [...] She also opined on Macfadyen's cameo raturn as Tom Quinn, [...] "it made no sense at all. Obviously it was super cheesy. But obviously I completely loved it – despite knowing it was coming." [...] Sam Wollaston stated the episode [...] "was like the climax of an indulgent 70s heavy metal track, all banging drums and screaming guitars, licks and twists, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that's it, but then there's a bit more, all turned up to 11." [...] Wollaston enjoyed the [...] "incessant high action – stabbing, strangling, scrambling, unscrambling," [...] as well as [...] "revelation after revelation, fired from an automatic weapon." [...] He also said to have been [...] "physically and emotionally drained" [...] watching the episode, concluding the review with [...] "If Spooks is [...] "crap", as John le Carré says, then crap doesn't get much better." ...|$|E
2500|$|As with season one, {{the writing}} team {{came up with}} more [...] "what if" [...] episodes for the series, like season two's [...] "Visitor", which came from the idea of, [...] "what if someone showed up and Clark began {{to believe that he}} wasn't the last person from his planet." [...] In the case of [...] "Nocturne", [...] "what if Clark had been brought up by {{different}} parents?" [...] With [...] "Nocturne", the episode is meant to be [...] "an extreme version of the Clark story". As Gough explains, [...] "Here's a kid with a condition, whose parents literally lock him in the basement. It's an extreme parenting episode—contrasting how these parents deal with Byron, and how the Kents deal with Clark." [...] The episode also dealt with Clark's fallibility, in the fact that Clark is only a teenager, and he does not always have all of the facts; just because he thinks he is doing the right thing {{does not necessarily mean that}} he is. In this case, Clark believes that he is saving Byron from his abusive parents. Gough clarifies, [...] "'s doing what he thinks is right, but ultimately unleashes the kid, and [...] causes damage. Just because you have the power <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you're right doesn't always mean you're taking the right course of action." [...] Another [...] "what if" [...] episode was [...] "Witness", which originally came from the concept, [...] "what if Clark witnessed a crime and had to testify in court as to why he was standing in the middle of the road at 2 o'clock in the morning?" [...] In the end, the court angle was dropped from the storyline, with Clark making an anonymous phone call to the Sheriff and eventually having to battle the three kryptonite powered thieves that he had witnessed stealing.|$|E
