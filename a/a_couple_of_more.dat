500|$|However, Canham later {{denied that}} Elliott was [...] "eased out" [...] of his job. [...] In an {{interview}} with Joe Falls, Canham said: [...] "Bump and I are close personal friends. [...] Bump is not naïve – he knows that when you work at a place for 10 years and you’re not winning consistently, it doesn’t become fun for anybody – the coach, the alumni, the players or anybody else. [...] We talked about this {{and we talked about}} it openly. [...] If Bump had said to me, ‘Look, give me <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>more</b> years,’ I would have given it to him. [...] I mean that. [...] I didn’t fire Bump Elliott. [...] My first year as director Bump had an 8 and 2 record. [...] Anyone could live with that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout 1992 {{the band}} enjoyed {{a series of}} {{successful}} tours, particularly their debut {{on one of the}} main stages of the Glastonbury Festival. Mixing tracks from their first two LPs with <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>more</b> obscure songs and a cover of Charlie Daniels' [...] "The Devil Went Down to Georgia", the Levellers' performance secured their place on the large Pyramid Stage for the following year. The band also scored a chart hit with the 15 Years EP, a track which was added to later re-pressings of Levelling the Land due to its popularity.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe give a {{necessary}} and sufficient {{condition for the}} existence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> increasing <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> N (N≥ 2) synchronous dynamics on S^ Z^d (PCA). Increasing means the coupling preserves stochastic ordering. We first present our main construction theorem in the case where S is totally ordered, applications to attractive PCA's are given. When S is only partially ordered, we show on two examples that <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> <b>more</b> than two synchronous dynamics may not exist. We also prove an extension of our main result for a particular class of partially ordered spaces...|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard magazine, Keys stated that she [...] "eliminated all of the boundaries and all the limitations, {{so that you can}} feel your freedom and express your freedom in every way you possibly can". The Element of Freedom was scheduled to be released on December 1, 2009, to correspond with World AIDS Day, but was pushed back to December 15 for additional recording. According to the senior vice president of urban marketing for J Records, Keys [...] "had <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>more</b> things in the oven and she wants this to be right [...] So we gave her the additional time she needed." [...] Keys pointed out that she felt the album was being rushed for no reason. In {{an interview}} with Scottish newspaper The Scotsman, she stated that it [...] "seems unfair to have to rush these songs that were still coming and not allow them to be the best songs they could be. It was just two weeks' difference, but it made for an even better record".|$|E

They're chasing wild horses, and want me to throw in with them. Now with you and maybe <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>more</b> riders {{we can make a}} big drive. You've got to know the tricks. I learned a heap from a Mormon wild-horse wrangler. If these broomtails are thick here--well, I don't want to set your hopes too high. But wait till I show you." ...|$|E

An' Ted Meeker heerd it from Greaves, who didn't die till {{the next day}} after Jean Isbel knifed him. An' your dad shot Ted fer tellin' what he heerd.... No, Greaves wasn't killed outright. He was cut somethin' turrible--in two places. They wrapped him all up an' next day packed him in a wagon back to Grass Valley. Evarts says Ted Meeker was {{friendly}} with Greaves an' {{went to see him}} as he was layin' in his room next to the store. Wal, accordin' to Meeker's story, Greaves came to an' talked. He said he was sittin' there in the dark, shootin' occasionally at Isbel's cabin, when he heerd a rustle behind him in the grass. He knowed some one was crawlin' on him. But before he could get his gun around he was jumped by {{what he thought was a}} grizzly bear. But it was a man. He shut off Greaves's wind an' dragged him back in the ditch. An' he said: 'Greaves, it's the half-breed. An' he's goin' to cut you--FIRST FOR ELLEN JORTH! an' then for Gaston Isbel!' ... Greaves said Jean ripped him with a bowie knife.... An' thet was all Greaves remembered. He died soon after tellin' this story. He must hev fought awful hard. Thet second cut Isbel gave him went clear through him.... Some of the gang was thar when Greaves talked, an' naturally they wondered why Jean Isbel had said 'first for Ellen Jorth.' ... Somebody remembered thet Greaves had cast a slur on your good name, Ellen. An' then they had Jean Isbel's reason fer sayin' thet to Greaves. It caused a lot of talk. An' when Simm Bruce busted in some of the gang haw-hawed him an' said as how he'd get the third cut from Jean Isbel's bowie. Bruce was half drunk an' he began to cuss an' rave about Jean Isbel bein' in love with his girl.... As bad luck would have it, <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>more</b> fellars come in an' asked Meeker questions. He jest got to thet part, 'Greaves, it's the half-breed, an' he's goin' to cut you--FIRST FOR ELLEN JORTH,' when in walked your father! ... Then it all had to come out--what Jean Isbel had said an' done--an' why. How Greaves had backed Simm Bruce in slurrin' you!" ...|$|E
