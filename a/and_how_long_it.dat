5|$|Firearms combat is first-person, with {{character}} points {{assigned to}} the firearms skill determining the shot's accuracy <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> takes to target an opponent. Melee combat is third-person, with access to weapons such as katanas and sledgehammers for melee combat, or pistols, crossbows and flamethrowers for firearm combat. If a player sneaks up on an opponent, they can perform an instant kill; weapons provide unique instant kill animations. The player can block attacks manually or automatically, by leaving their character idle. They can use stealth in missions by sneaking past guards and security cameras, picking locks, and hacking computers to locate alternative routes.|$|E
25|$|By the 1950s, {{scientific}} management {{had grown}} dated, but its goals and practices remained attractive and were also being {{adopted by the}} German Democratic Republic as it sought to increase efficiency in its industrial sectors.

25|$|A drug's {{distribution}} coefficient strongly affects how easily the drug can reach its intended {{target in the}} body, how strong an effect it will have once it reaches its target, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> {{will remain in the}} body in an active form. Hence, the log P of a molecule is one criterion used in decision-making by medicinal chemists in pre-clinical drug discovery, for example, in the assessment of druglikeness of drug candidates. Likewise, it is used to calculate lipophilic efficiency in evaluating the quality of research compounds, where the efficiency for a compound is defined as its potency, via measured values of pIC50 or pEC50, minus its value of log P.|$|E
500|$|The gum {{varied in}} color {{depending}} {{on the condition of}} the original tree. It also depended on where the gum had formed <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> had been buried. Colors ranged from chalky-white, through red-brown to black; the most prized was a pale gold, as it was hard and translucent. The size of each lump also varied greatly. Swamps tended to yield the small nuggets known as [...] "chips", whereas the hillsides tended to produce larger lumps. The majority were the size of acorns, although some were found which weighed a few pounds; the largest (and rarest) were reported to weigh half a hundredweight. Kauri gum shares a few characteristics with amber, another fossilised resin found in the Northern Hemisphere, but where amber can be dated as millions of years old, carbon-dating suggests the age of most kauri gum is a few thousand years.|$|E
500|$|Other {{facets of}} Quorum are parental {{controls}} and spam filtering. Norton Internet Security 2010 bundles a free subscription of OnlineFamily.Norton, which PC Magazine {{found to be}} an improvement over the parental controls bundled with prior releases. Spam filtering uses technologies Symantec acquired from Brightmail. Two filters are used to find spam: a locally installed one and a check against Symantec's servers {{to see if the}} message is known spam. In PC Magazine testing, no valid e-mail were marked as spam. However, 11 percent of spam still made it to the inbox. [...] This was a significant improvement over prior releases. Another improvement to the product is the improved heuristic feature called SONAR 2. [...] It leverages reputation data to judge if a program is malicious or clean. Norton Insight has also been expanded, showing users the number of Norton Community participants who have a certain program installed, its impact of system resources, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> has been released. Information about the program's origin and a graph of its resource usage is also provided. A new feature codenamed [...] "Autospy" [...] helps users understand what Norton did when malware was found. The malware's actions and Norton's resolution are presented to the user. Previous releases removed threats on sight and quietly warned users, potentially confusing when users are deceived in downloading rogue security software.|$|E

2500|$|Health {{locus of}} control is how people measure and {{understand}} how people relate their health to their behavior, health status <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> may take to recover from a disease. Locus of control can influence how people think and react towards their health and health decisions. Each day we are exposed to potential diseases that may affect our health. The way we approach that reality {{has a lot to}} do with our {{locus of control}}. Sometimes it is expected to see older adults experience progressive declines in their health, for this reason it is believed that their health locus of control will be affected. However, this does not necessarily mean that their locus of control will be affected negatively but older adults may experience decline in their health and this can show lower levels of internal locus of control.|$|E

2500|$|The {{consequences}} of scientific fraud vary {{based on the}} severity of the fraud, the level of notice it receives, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> goes undetected. [...] For cases of fabricated evidence, the consequences can be wide-ranging, with others working to confirm (or refute) the false finding, or with research agendas being distorted to address the fraudulent evidence. [...] The Piltdown Man fraud is a case in point: [...] The significance of the bona-fide fossils that were being found was muted for decades because they disagreed with Piltdown Man and the preconceived notions that those faked fossils supported. [...] In addition, the prominent paleontologist Arthur Smith Woodward spent time at Piltdown each year until he died, trying to find more Piltdown Man remains. [...] The misdirection of resources kept others from taking the real fossils more seriously and delayed the reaching of a correct understanding of human evolution. [...] (The Taung Child, which should have been the death knell for the view that the human brain evolved first, was instead treated very critically because of its disagreement with the Piltdown Man evidence.) ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} September 1974, the Royals {{announced}} that Boros was being elevated to the major league club to replace Charley Lau on the team's coaching staff for the 1975 season. He was the Royals third base coach in 1975 under manager Whitey Herzog. From 1976 to 1979, he was the Royal's first base coach and was [...] "credited with helping the Royals develop an aggressive baserunning style." [...] While Boros was in Kansas City, he began to attract media attention for his [...] "scientific approach" [...] to baseball. In July 1977, the UPI published a feature story about Boros in which it observed:"Boros began putting a book together on all the pitchers and catchers in the American League last year, noting their strengths and weaknesses and any tipoffs that might give Royal runners an edge on the basepaths. His observations were written into a small 25-cent notepad along with a flock of stopwatch readings that represent {{the time it takes}} a pitcher to throw the ball to home plate out of both the stretch and windup, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> takes a catcher to peg the ball to second and third base." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Long Walk" [...] {{started in}} the {{beginning}} of spring in 1864. Bands of Navajo led by the Army were relocated from their traditional lands in eastern Arizona Territory and western New Mexico Territory to Fort Sumner (in an area called the Bosque Redondo or [...] by the Navajo) in the Pecos River valley. (Bosque Redondo is Spanish for [...] "round forest"—in New Mexican Spanish a bosque means a river-bottom forest usually containing cottonwood trees.) The march was one that was very difficult and pushed many Navajos to their breaking point, including death. The distance itself was cruel, but the fact that they did not receive any aid from the soldiers was devastating. Not every single person was in prime condition to trek 300 miles, many began the walk exhausted and malnourished, others were not properly clothed and were not in the least prepared for such a long journey. Neither sympathy nor remorse were given to the Navajos. They were never informed as to where they were going, why they were being relocated, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> would take to get there.
