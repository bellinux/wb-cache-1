5|$|Lens luxation, {{also known}} as ectopia lentis {{is the most common}} {{hereditary}} disorder in Jack Russell terriers. Even so, this condition is not a common occurrence in the breed. Most frequently appearing in dogs between the ages of 3 and 8 years old, it is where the lens in one or both eyes becomes displaced. There are two types, posterior luxation (where the lens slips {{to the back of the}} eye) and anterior luxation (where the lens slips forward). Posterior luxation is the less severe of the two types, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> appear normal although the dog's eyesight will be affected. In anterior luxation, the lens can slip forward and rub against the cornea, damaging it. Anterior luxation also has a high probability of causing glaucoma which can lead to partial or complete blindness. Treatment is available and may include both medical and surgical options. Secondary lens luxation is caused by trauma to the eye and is not hereditary. The condition appears in a number of terrier breeds as well as the Border collie, Brittany and Cardigan Welsh corgi.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{the peace}} between England and France, Pope Sixtus IV issued in 1483 a Papal bull {{granting}} the Privilege of Neutrality, by which the Islands, their harbours and seas, as far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> see, were considered neutral territory. Anyone molesting Islanders would be excommunicated. A Royal Charter in 1548 confirmed the neutrality. Not that the French behaved, as they attempted to invade Jersey a year later in 1549 but were defeated by the militia. The neutrality lasted another century, until William III of England abolished the privilege due to privateering activity against Dutch ships.|$|E

These areas are characterized by expansive lowlands that stretch <b>as</b> far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>can</b> see and are ideal for sugar planting because of the city's naturally fertile soil. It is no wonder why 73% of the city's total land area is devoted primarily to agriculture.|$|R
500|$|Chay Wa's grave is in Choa Chu Kang Cemetery's Buddhist sector, grave number 3222, Block 8. It is {{difficult}} to locate, as it stands {{in a sea of}} tombstones that stretch almost as far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> see. In 1985, it was reported that the inscription of the tombstone had been whited out with plaster by members of Tan's own family who wished to obscure any glorification of Chay Wa's [...] "martyrdom" [...] in the communist cause. At that time, all that could be seen clearly was a photograph of Chay Wa and some lettering showing his name and the years of his birth and death.|$|E

The writer made these additional observations: [...] "Maude (from what fair creature the place has taken its name, I can’t say) boasts a store, a pub., post office, a police barracks, a punt over the river, and a talking cockatoo".|$|E
2500|$|Cuppy's best-known work, a satire {{on history}} called The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody, was {{unfinished}} when he died. Its humor ranges from the remark that, when the Nile floods receded, the land, as far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> see, is [...] "covered by Egyptologists", to the detailed dissection, quotation, and parody, {{in the chapter}} on Alexander the Great, of the picture of Alexander as an idealist for world peace.

Murrow and his colleague Don Hollenbeck took turns reading from it on the air [...] "until the announcer cracked up." ...|$|E

50|$|Sewing needles are an {{application}} of wire-making technology, which started {{to appear in the}} second millennium B.C. Some fine examples of Bronze Age gold torques are made of very consistent gold wire, which is more malleable than bronze. However, copper and bronze needles {{do not need to be}} <b>as</b> long: <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> be made by turning the wire back on itself and redrawing it through the die.|$|R
25|$|For artists, most {{pigments}} {{and papers}} have a cool or warm cast, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> human <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> detect even a minute amount of saturation. Gray mixed with yellow, orange, or red is a “warm gray”. Green, blue, or purple create “cool grays”. Note that {{this sense of}} temperature is the reverse of that of real temperature; bluer is described as “cooler” even though it corresponds to a higher-temperature black body.|$|R
2500|$|Bilston-born Samuel Griffiths, in his 1876 Griffiths Guide to the Iron Trade of Great Britain , stated [...] "The Black Country commences at Wolverhampton, extends a {{distance}} of sixteen miles to Stourbridge, eight miles to West Bromwich, penetrating the northern districts through Willenhall to Bentley, The Birchills, Walsall and Darlaston, Wednesbury, Smethwick and Dudley Port, West Bromwich and Hill Top, Brockmoor, Wordsley and Stourbridge.

2500|$|At {{the end of}} Durga Puja the {{immersion}} {{ceremony in}} the Ichamati offers a unique spectacle along the India-Bangladesh river border. The Ichhamati river, which acts as a natural border between the two countries, becomes the scene of tremendous revelry on this day, when boats crammed with people from both countries converge here to immerse their respective idols. Boats of {{all shapes and sizes}} can be seen on the river, as far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> see — each one flying the flag of its respective country. It is the only day during the year when border patrolling is relaxed and people can cross {{over to the other side}} of the river. [...] While earlier, after immersing their idols, people could even disembark from their boats on the other side, restrictions imposed by border officials in the last few years has put an end to this practice.|$|E
50|$|Blinking covers <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> with a {{thin layer}} of tear fluid, thereby {{promoting}} a moist environment necessary for the cells of the exterior part of <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> <b>The</b> tears also flush out foreign bodies and wash them away. This is crucial to maintain lubrication and proper eye health. If this process is impaired, <b>as</b> in lagophthalmos, <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> suffer abrasions and infections. Lagopthalmos leads to corneal drying and ulceration.|$|R
5000|$|In printing, grey {{is usually}} {{obtained}} with the CMYK color model, using cyan, magenta, yellow and black. Grey is produced either by using black and white, or by combining {{equal amounts of}} cyan, magenta and yellow. Most greys have a cool or warm cast to them, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> human <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> detect even a minute amount of color saturation. Yellow, orange, and red create a [...] "warm grey". Green, blue, and violet create a [...] "cool grey". When no color is added, the color is [...] "neutral grey", [...] "achromatic grey" [...] or simply [...] "grey". Images consisting wholly of black, white and greys are called monochrome, black-and-white or greyscale.|$|R
50|$|Before {{electronic}} {{light sensitive}} elements were developed, photometry {{was done by}} estimation by <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> <b>The</b> relative luminous flux of a source was compared with a standard source. The photometer is placed such that the illuminance from the source being investigated is equal to <b>the</b> standard source, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> human <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> judge equal illuminance. The relative luminous fluxes can then be calculated <b>as</b> <b>the</b> illuminance decreases proportionally to the inverse square of distance. A standard {{example of such a}} photometer consists of a piece of paper with an oil spot on it that makes the paper slightly more transparent. When the spot is not visible from either side, the illuminance from the two sides is equal.|$|R

6000|$|... § IV. I {{have a more}} {{confirmed}} opinion, however, {{respecting the}} decoration of curved surfaces. The majesty of a roof is never, I think, so great, <b>as</b> when <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> pass undisturbed {{over the course of}} all its curvatures, and trace the dying of the shadows along its smooth and sweeping vaults. And I would rather, myself, have a plain ridged Gothic vault, with all its rough stones visible, to keep the sleet and wind out of a cathedral aisle, than all the fanning and pendanting and foliation that ever bewildered Tudor weight. But mosaic or fresco may of course be used {{as far as we can}} afford or obtain them; for these do not break the curvature. Perhaps the most solemn roofs in the world are the apse conchas of the Romanesque basilicas, with their golden ground and severe figures. Exactly opposed to these are the decorations which disturb the serenity of the curve without giving it interest, like the vulgar panelling of St. Peter's and the Pantheon; both, I think, in the last degree detestable.|$|R
