40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using constructed wetlands (CWs) for the mitigation of pesticide runoff {{has been studied}} in the last decade. However, a lack of related data was verified when subsurface flow constructed wetlands (SSF CWs) are considered for this purpose. In the present work, SSF CWs were submitted to continuous ametryn addition and evaluated during an I I-week period, {{with the aim of}} determining the {{feasibility of}} these systems for mitigation of contaminated water. Ametryn was not added to one CW cell in order to provide a control for the experiments. Monitoring of treatment performance was executed by standard water quality parameters, ametryn chromatography quantification and macrophyte (Typha latifolia L) nutritional and <b>agronomic</b> <b>property</b> analysis. Results indicated that 39 % of the total initially added amount of ametryn was removed, transferred or transformed. Herbicide metabolism and mineralisation were carried out by chemical and biological mechanisms. No statistic differences were observed in nutritional contents found in the T. latifolia crops of the CWs after the experimental period. Moreover, the biomass production (one valuable source of renewable energy) was equal to 3. 3 t. ha(- 1) (dry matter) in wetland cells. It was concluded that constructed wetland systems are capable of mitigating water contaminated with ametryn, acting as buffer filters between the emission sources and the downstream superficial water bodies...|$|E

For <b>agronomic</b> <b>properties,</b> the final whole stalk yield was higher as the plant population increased {{and as the}} altitude of the location on the slope decreased. Average fiber lengths of bast and core showed maxima at 225 000 plants/ha. Cellulose content increased as the plant population increased. For the kraft pulp characteristics of kenaf whole stalk, the total pulp yield was lower as the plant population increased, with the maximum difference about 1.3 %. Sheet strengths and average fiber length attained maxima at around 225000 – 315000 plants/ha. The largest pulp strengths (breaking length, burst index, and folding endurance) were seen at a plant population of 225000 plants/ha, and the largest tear index was seen at a plant population of 315 000 plants/ha. When the <b>agronomic</b> <b>properties</b> and whole stalk kraft pulp characteristics were combined, a plant population between 225 000 and 315 000 plants/ha, {{which is a little}} higher than that of kenaf bast production for textiles, was selected as the optimum cultivated kenaf plant population for whole stalk kraft pulp and papermaking on arid hillside land in China.|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the shrinkage processes and characteristics of three typical swelling soils in Shaanxi, China, with different height treatment using a modified core method and to analyze their <b>agronomic</b> <b>properties.</b> Three swelling soils, Calcarit Regosol, Eutric Cambisol, and Cumulic Anthrosol, collected in Ansai, Ankang, and Yangling, respectively, were investigated. The experimental procedure consisted of the simultaneous measurements of the height (H), diameter (D), and mass (m) of initially saturated soil core samples during dehydration by evaporation. The results showed that soil texture (clay content) and structure [bulk density (rho (b)) ] affected the shape of soil shrinkage characteristic curve (SSCC), but the sigmoid shape of the shrinkage curve could be regarded as a general characteristic for well-structured soils. The influence of core sample height on the shrinkage characteristics was due to the pressure increase resulting from the overlaying soil mass. The computer code (CARHYS) proposed for soil hydrostructural characterization was applied to analyze the discontinuous SSCC data. The computer calculations revealed that it could fit the data very well with a correlation coefficient > 0. 9755 for the three soils and determine characteristic transition points of all of the different phases of SSCC accurately. Analysis of the geometry factor exhibited that soil shrinkage was anisotropic and only subsidence of soil surface happened at the beginning of shrinkage. According to the relation between the transition points in the SSCC and the particular soil moisture states available water (AW), readily available water (RAW), air capacity (AC), and swell-shrink potential (coefficient of linear extensibility (COLE)) were calculated from the parameters obtained by CARHYS. AC of the soils was consistent with rho (b). AW and RAW were affected by both clay content and rho (b). The investigated soils were all ranked in the low-swelling class according to the classification of the US Department of Agriculture. Next to clay content, rho (b) should be considered as an important physical factor affecting the <b>agronomic</b> <b>properties</b> and the swell-shrink behavior of the soils.

40|$|In {{conventional}} orchards, weeds on the raw {{are mainly}} controlled with chemical herbicides {{because of their}} efficiency, their low cost and ease of use. The most common method in organic orchard to eliminate weeds on the raw consists of tillage operations. However, some drawbacks of these mechanical methods have been demonstrated: (1) the energetic cost (non-renewable energy) is high, (2) this method is time-consuming, (3) tillage interferes {{with the development of}} superficial roots and can hurt the trunk, (4) the physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil can be disturb and (5) erosion and runoff potentially increase. Cover crops are interesting alternatives to manage ground cover but the effect on the <b>agronomic</b> <b>properties</b> and the soil fertility of these methods should be assessed. This study is included in the national program “Casdar SolAB” supported by the French Ministry of Agriculture. The effect of a White Clover crop versus tillage practice on the tree raw was assessed in an irrigated organic Peach orchard. White Clover was sowed in 2004. Soil parameters (water and nutrients availability, soil porosity, root density, earthworms density, soil profile) and agronomic parameters (yield, fruit quality, pests and diseases damages) were recorded since 2004.

40|$|The use of DNA markers {{in public}} sector plant {{breeding}} {{is now the}} norm. Such markers are common across breeding programs and this commonality enables and enhances collaboration. Therefore, large collaborative research projects that measure several phenotypes across multiple environments coupled with the expanding amount of genotype data attainable with current marker technologies {{are on the rise}} and these projects demand efficient data delivery. However, development of computational tools for advanced data integration, visualization, and analysis is still a bottleneck, even though these resources have the greatest potential impact for users who are extracting and developing hypothesis-based solutions. The Hordeum Toolbox (THT) was developed as a data resource for the Barley Coordinated Agricultural Project (CAP) with the novel capability of constructing user-defined downloadable sets of phenotype and/or genotype data for downstream analysis. Internal tools in THT enable users to create clusters of a selected group of lines based on genotype data, parse pedigrees, and select germplasm based on haplotype, phenotype, and <b>agronomic</b> <b>properties.</b> The Hordeum Toolbox can be adapted to breeding programs or collaborations to assist researchers in germplasm selection, genotype data visualization, and the integration of complex data sets for statistical analysis...|$|R
