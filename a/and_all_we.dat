500|$|Despite this, {{the episode}} {{received}} some negative reviews. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt was more negative towards the episode writing that [...] "Here, {{we have a}} case where an episode could have signaled at least {{some sense of what}} else the show might be interested in other than Andy as the well-meaning but hapless boss and Pam and Angela's dueling pregnancies, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> got were variations on those storylines with no new angle either narratively". He gave the episode a C. IGN writer Cindy White considered the episode superior to previous [...] "external" [...] episodes [...] "Christening" [...] and [...] "Phyllis' Wedding", but considered it inferior to the [...] "Niagara" [...] and the [...] "classic" [...] "Booze Cruise". She criticized the main plot for rehashing previous plot lines and ultimately gave the episode a 7.0/10.|$|E

500|$|Shane Hegarty of The Irish Times {{wrote that}} it [...] "may {{not have been}} a vintage episode [...] but it had plenty of good moments, and from an Irish {{perspective}} it was a fascinating opportunity to see ourselves {{through the eyes of the}} greatest comedy series ever written." [...] He added that [...] "even as it reveled in stereotypes, it used them to continue the running joke about how Ireland doesn't conform to American's [...] views of it." [...] Pat Stacey of the Evening Herald gave the episode two stars. He wrote that he enjoyed the jokes about the Irish landmarks but called it [...] "a fairly slapdash, ramshackle half-hour" [...] and mentioned that Colm Meaney deserved a better role. Evan Fanning of the Sunday Independent wrote [...] "Yes, The Simpsons came to Ireland <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> got was some lousy rehashed jokes and a feeling that the whole thing was a bit of a waste of time." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{showing the}} songs to the band, McKinnon and Skaff worked on them alone. When the pair {{had all of}} the song ideas, they worked on them as a full-band, with {{pre-production}} being undertaken in, as Skaff commented, [...] "a makeshift studio" [...] by Andrew Wade. Woodard commented that the band had [...] "been going in from 11am until 9pm <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> do is sit around and play." [...] Between demoing the songs, and their final forms on the album, Woodard said [...] "crazy things were happening – verses became choruses", with Chad Gilbert assisting the band with arrangements and writing. As the band thought they were getting better as songwriters, Woodard stated, [...] "it's getting more heavy and more pop." [...] One song that the band recorded was [...] "screwed up really bad and it didn't make the record", as Skaff comments, as the group recorded it at a fast pace and when McKinnon tried to [...] "sing it was like rap music. [...] And we were like 'that's not good'." [...] Asked if the band would {{use it as a}} possible B-side, Skaff said [...] "its possible [...] might use it for the next record or something like that." ...|$|E
500|$|On 3 November 2011, Samaras started against Rennes in a Europa League {{match at}} Celtic Park. Celtic won the match 3–1 with Samaras getting two assists. He drew plaudits for his much noticed work-rate and {{determination}} during the match. Samaras then started the next match against Motherwell in the SPL {{and set up}} another goal for Anthony Stokes, Celtic {{went on to win}} the match 2–1 after being 1–0 down. Samaras went on to score his first goal of the 2011–12 season in a 5–0 win over St Mirren. Manager Neil Lennon said that; [...] "He got his goal, which we've been waiting on a long time. His play was fantastic. He is a talent <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> are asking for is consistency. He has shown everyone today what he is capable of when he is in full flow. The rest took a leaf from his book." [...] After an impressive performance in Celtic's 1–1 draw against Italian league leaders Udinese, fellow Serie A side Palermo expressed an interest in Samaras. He had been playing as a left midfielder in the previous few weeks, and the Daily Record said that his good form since returning to the team had helped re-ignite Celtic's season. On 24 December, Samaras started as a striker and scored twice as Celtic beat Kilmarnock 2–1.|$|E

500|$|Breaking {{was created}} in the South Bronx, New York City during the early 1970s. It is the first hip-hop dance style. At the time of its creation, it was the only hip-hop dance style because Afrika Bambaataa {{classified}} it as one of the five pillars of hip-hop culture along with MCing (rapping), DJing (turntablism), graffiti writing (bombing), and knowledge. Though African Americans created breaking, Puerto Ricans maintained its growth and development when it was considered a fad in the late 1970s. In a 2001 interview Richard [...] "Crazy Legs" [...] Colón, the president of Rock Steady Crew, commented on how Puerto Ricans contributed to breaking: [...] "I think the difference is when the brothas first started doing [...] and it was at its infancy they weren't doing acrobatic moves. That didn't come into play until more Puerto Ricans got involved in the mid 70s. We then took the dance, evolved it and kept it alive. In '79 I was getting dissed. I would go into a dance and I would get dissed by a lot of brothas who would ask 'Why y'all still doing that dance? That's played out'. By 79, there were very few African American brothas that was doing this... We always maintained the flava. It was like a changing of the guard <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> did was add more flava to something that already existed." [...] Breaking includes four foundational dances: toprock, footwork-oriented steps performed while standing up; downrock, footwork performed with both hands and feet on the floor; freezes, stylish poses done on your hands; and power moves, complex and impressive acrobatic moves. Transitions from toprock to downrock are called [...] "drops." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 22 April 1951 the Chinese were {{advancing}} towards Kapyong Valley {{defeating the}} ROK positions in their way. The Canadian battalion called the Patricias or {{known as the}} 2 PPCLI became aware of their advances from the two regiments of the 6th ROK because they were retreating past their positions. As one Canadian recalled it, [...] "e looked out <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> could see were South Korean troops flying past us along with all these monstrous American Vehicles they were supplied with". With this overwhelming alarm, the Canadians started digging trenches and positioning themselves on Hill 677. They also put positions on the mile-long ridge that was connected to it. Hill 677 for the Canadians was positioned {{on the west side}} of the Kapyong River. On Hill 504, dug in were the 3rd Royal Australian Regiment which was on the other side of hill 677 and who were also ready for the Chinese attack.|$|E
2500|$|The navy's assault {{involved}} 400 {{sailors and}} marines in 25 boats. The operation was a fiasco {{from beginning to}} end. [...] Poor reconnaissance, planning, and communication all characterized the operation. Commander Thomas H. Stevens, Jr., commanding the monitor Patapsco, was placed {{in charge of the}} assault. When Commander Stevens protested that he [...] "knew nothing of [...] organization [...] " [...] and [...] "made some remonstrances on this grounds and others." [...] Dahlgren replied, [...] "There is nothing but a corporal's guard [...] in the fort, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> have to do is go and take possession." [...] This underestimation of the Confederate forces on Dahlgren's part may explain why he was hostile to a joint operation wishing to reserve the credit for the victory to the navy. Less than half of the boats landed. [...] Most of the boats that did land landed on the right flank or right gorge angle, rather than on the gorge where there was a passable breach. The Union sailors and marines who did land could not scale the wall. [...] The Confederates fired upon the landing party and as well as throwing hand grenades and loose bricks. The men in the boats that had not landed fired muskets and revolvers blindly at the fort, endangering the landing party more than the garrison. The landing party took shelter in shell holes in the wall of the fort. In response to a signal rocket fired by the garrison, Fort Johnson and the Confederate warship CSS Chicora opened fire upon the boats and landing party. The boats that could withdraw withdrew and the landing party surrendered. The Union casualties were 8 killed, 19 wounded, and 105 captured (including 15 of the wounded). The Confederates did not suffer any casualties in the assault.|$|E
