500|$|Adult {{entertainment}} attorney Robert Apgood stated {{he agreed}} with the actions of Acworth and Randazza. Apgood pointed out he had observed {{a significant increase in}} applications to the USPTO that were rejected because their potential trademarks were deemed [...] "scandalous" [...] by the government. He stated, [...] "It's really quite unfortunate that the executive branch is now reaching deep into the machinations of government to further its 'legislation of morality' agenda. It is truly encouraging to see the likes of Acworth and Randazza take up this sorely needed fight." [...] The appeal was denied in April 2008 and the case was terminated.

50|$|As {{with the}} prep {{schools of the}} other United States service academies, there is no {{separate}} application for USMAPS, only the West Point application. Admission officers will offer USMAPS to potential West Point cadets who have received their Congressional appointments yet may lack the grades or skills necessary for West Point. During {{the middle of the}} prep school year, Cadet Candidates must submit new applications to West Point, including the Congressional nomination. By June, Cadet Candidates will receive word of their <b>application</b> <b>status</b> and West Point acceptance. Most of those who attend the prep school will go on to West Point, contingent on their application, academics and grades, physical training, and military instruction. Some candidates may transfer to other service academies, or be sent back to the United States Army as a regular enlisted soldier. Invitational reservists have other options at the completion of the USMAPS year. Invitational reservists who entered USMAPS with no existing contract to the military and are denied admission to West Point or who decline their appointment can return to civilian life with no further obligation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{agency in}} charge of admitting new {{citizens}} is the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, commonly abbreviated as USCIS. It is a bureau of the Department of Homeland Security. It offers web-based services. The agency depends on application fees for revenue; in 2009, with a struggling economy, applications were down sharply, and consequently there was much less revenue to upgrade and streamline services. There was speculation that if the administration of president Barack Obama passed immigration reform measures, then the agency could face a [...] "welcome but overwhelming surge of Americans-in-waiting" [...] and longer processing times for citizenship applications. The USCIS has made efforts to digitize records. A USCIS website says the [...] "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is committed to offering the best possible service to you, our customer" [...] and which says [...] "With our focus on customer service, we offer you a variety of services {{both before and after}} you file your case." [...] The website allowed applicants to estimate the length of time required to process specific types of cases, to check <b>application</b> <b>status,</b> and to access a customer guide.
