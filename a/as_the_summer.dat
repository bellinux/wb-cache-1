5|$|In October 1986, the IOC {{had voted}} {{to hold the}} Olympic Winter Games halfway through the {{four-year}} Olympiad, {{rather than in the}} same year <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> Games, and this change started with the XVIIth Olympic Winter Games in 1994 in Lillehammer, Norway. A total of 67 nations took part, including the Czech Republic and Slovakia as independent teams, and each of the ex-Soviet nations.|$|E
5|$|In his 1998 {{autobiography}} For the Love of the Game, Jordan {{wrote that}} he had been preparing for retirement as early <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> of 1992. The added exhaustion due to the Dream Team run in the 1992 Olympics solidified Jordan's feelings about the game and his ever-growing celebrity status. Jordan's announcement sent shock waves throughout the NBA and appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> of 1985 continued, {{sales of}} the C5 {{remained}} far below Sinclair's predictions; only 8,000 had been sold by July. In {{the middle of that}} month, the Advertising Standards Authority ordered Sinclair to amend or withdraw its advertisements for the C5 after finding that the company's claims about the safety and speed of the C5 either could not be proved or were not justified. Retailers attempted to deal with unsold stocks of C5s by drastically cutting the vehicle's price. Comet first reduced the price to £259.90 {{but by the end of}} the year was selling C5s with a complete set of accessories for only £139.99, 65% less than the initial price.|$|E
5|$|Aston's {{return to}} England in late 1626, {{along with all}} the Catholic settlers, failed to deter Baltimore, who finally sailed for Newfoundland in 1627, {{arriving}} on 23 July and staying only two months before returning to England. He had taken both Protestant and Catholic settlers with him, as well as two secular priests, Thomas Longville and Anthony Pole (also known as Smith), the latter remaining behind in the colony when Baltimore departed for England. The land Baltimore had seen was by no means the paradise described by some early settlers, being only marginally productive; <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> climate was deceptively mild, his brief visit gave Baltimore no reason to alter his plans for the colony.|$|E
5|$|Comiket, {{short for}} Comic Market, {{is a large}} comic {{convention}} held twice a year in Tokyo, Japan during August and December, which are referred to <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> and winter Comic Markets, respectively. Key has been {{an active participant in}} the convention since Comiket 57 in December 1999, where they sold Kanon-related products (as Kanon was their only release at the time); one such product was a Zippo lighter. The first Air-related products Key sold at the convention were at Comiket 59 in December 2000. Typical products include: postcards, telephone cards, calendars, posters, and albums. The products Key sells at Comiket are all related to the visual novels the brand produces.|$|E

5|$|The sand whiting (Sillago ciliata), {{also known}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> whiting, yellowfin whiting or blue-nose whiting, {{is a common}} species of coastal marine fish of the family Sillaginidae, the smelt-whitings. It is a slender, {{slightly}} compressed fish that {{is very similar to}} other species of Sillago, with detailed spine, ray and lateral line scale counts needed to distinguish the species between its nearest relative Sillago analis. The sand whiting is distributed along the east coast of Australia from Cape York south to Tasmania, as well as Lord Howe Island and New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian shadow clocks divided daytime into 12 {{parts with}} each part further divided into more precise parts. One type of shadow clock {{consisted}} of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which cast a shadow over those marks. It was positioned eastward in the morning, and was turned west at noon. Obelisks functioned {{in much the same}} manner: the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time. The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> and winter solstices. A third shadow clock, developed c. 1500, was similar in shape to a bent T-square. It measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The T was oriented eastward in the mornings, and turned around at noon, so that it could cast its shadow in the opposite direction.|$|E

5|$|Mysore {{is called}} the City of Palaces because of several ornate {{examples}} in the city. Among the most notable are Amba Vilas, popularly known as Mysore Palace; Jaganmohana Palace, which also serves as an art gallery; Rajendra Vilas, also known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> palace; Lalitha Mahal, which has {{been converted into a}} hotel; and Jayalakshmi Vilas. The main palace of Mysore was burned down in 1897, and the present-day structure was built on the same site. Amba Vilas palace exhibits an Indo-Saracenic style of architecture on the outside, but a distinctly Hoysala style in the interior. Even though the Government of Karnataka maintains the Mysore palace, a small portion has been allocated for the erstwhile Royal family to live in. The Jayalakshmi Vilas Mansion was constructed by Sri Chamaraja Wodeyar for his daughter Jayalakshammanni. It is now a museum dedicated to folk culture and artifacts of the royal family.|$|E
5|$|Spider-Man premiered in the Philippines on April 30, 2002 and had {{its general}} release in the United States on May 3, 2002. It became a {{critical}} and financial success; at the time, {{it was the}} only film to reach $100 million in its first weekend, had the largest opening weekend gross of all time, and was the most successful film based on a comic book. With $821.7 million worldwide, it was 2002's third-highest-grossing film and is the 56th-highest-grossing film of all time (seventh at the time of release). The film was nominated at the 75th Academy Awards ceremony for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound. The film is credited for redefining the modern superhero genre, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> blockbuster, and due to its success it was followed by two sequels, Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man 3 (2007).|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Games {{were the}} last {{to be held in}} the same year <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Summer</b> Games. They were hosted in the French Savoie region in the city of Albertville, though only 18 events were held in the city. The rest of the events were spread out over the Savoie. Political changes of the time were {{reflected}} in the Olympic teams appearing in France: this was the first Games to be held after the fall of Communism and the fall of the Berlin Wall, and Germany competed as a single nation {{for the first time since}} the 1964 Games; former Yugoslavian republics Croatia and Slovenia made their debuts as independent nations; most of the former Soviet republics still competed as a single team known as the Unified Team, but the Baltic States made independent appearances for the first time since before World War II. At 16years old, Finnish ski jumper Toni Nieminen made history by becoming the youngest male Winter Olympic champion. New Zealand skier Annelise Coberger became the first Winter Olympic medallist from the southern hemisphere when she won a silver medal in the women's slalom.|$|E

5|$|Yet while Solidarity {{was ready}} to take up {{negotiations}} with the government, the Polish communists were unsure what to do, as they issued empty declarations and bided their time. Against the background of a deteriorating communist shortage economy and unwillingness to negotiate seriously with Solidarity, it became increasingly clear that the Communist government would eventually have to suppress the Solidarity movement {{as the only way}} out of the impasse, or face a truly revolutionary situation. The atmosphere was increasingly tense, with various local chapters conducting a growing number of uncoordinated strikes as well as street protests, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Summer</b> 1981 hunger demonstrations in Poland, in response to the worsening economic situation. On December 3, 1981, Solidarity announced that a 24-hour strike would be held if the government were granted additional powers to suppress dissent, and that a general strike would be declared if those powers were used.|$|E
