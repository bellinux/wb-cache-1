5|$|Cyclone Graham of the 2002–03 Australian region cyclone {{season was}} a weak {{tropical}} storm that affected Australia during late February and early March 2003.

The storm moved slowly to the east-southeast, and after turning to the south it peaked as a tropical storm and made landfall on Western Australia the next day. The cyclone weakened as it moved inland, and dissipated on 1 March. The storm dropped heavy rainfall and caused high winds, which produced flooding and downed trees.
