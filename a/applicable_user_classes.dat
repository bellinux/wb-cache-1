40|$|AbstractOften a {{security}} system groups users into a hierarchy, with <b>user</b> <b>classes</b> on top {{having access to}} objects of <b>user</b> <b>classes</b> below them. Previously proposed cryptographic schemes [1 – 6] assign a key to each <b>user</b> <b>class.</b> Any <b>user</b> can compute from his key the keys of all <b>user</b> <b>classes</b> who are below him in the hierarchy, thus giving him their access privileges. Moreover, these schemes prevent the possibility of users collaborating to compute a key {{to which they are}} not entitled. The major disadvantage of the proposed schemes {{is that it is not}} easy to add a new user without having to change most of the previously defined keys. The other major disadvantage is the amount of storage it takes to store the keys. In this paper, we overcome these problems whenever the number of <b>user</b> <b>classes</b> is large and the hierarchical structure is non-skewed. The proposed algorithm, inspired by a remarkable concept invented by S. J. MacKinnon [5], also permits a user to access all files of users who are below him in the class hierarchy. It makes it easy, however, to add new user keys without affecting most of the previously-assigned keys...|$|R

40|$|Modern Location Based Services (LBS) are not {{any more}} limited to {{navigation}} or routing services, but they have flourished in every sphere of life whether it is regular activity tracker or family finder. The continuous advancement of location technologies, such as GNSS and cellular in outdoors and WLAN in indoors, opens new challenges for the LBS providers. Due {{to the emergence of}} location-enabled smartphone technologies, the use of location based services and applications has increased remarkably in the last few years. This forces the LBS providers to think beyond the boundaries. Therefore, the analysis of the user needs, behavior, perception and preference becomes one of the key factors and eventually prerequisites for success in this sector. The thesis comprises a survey focusing on LBS from different perspectives, such as localization knowledge, privacy concerns and LBS usage, and an analysis based on the responses from 118 volunteer participants. The analysis begins with the classification of the users with respect to their “technical knowledge in localization”, “privacy concerns” and “LBS usage” based on the survey results, and it continues with the analysis of the correlation and similarity between the <b>user</b> <b>classes.</b> The <b>user</b> <b>classes</b> are compared based on the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon, Fligner-Policello and unpaired t-test in terms of preferences similarity. The user perceptions with respect to the cost and feature preferences are also analyzed per <b>user</b> <b>class.</b> The aim of the thesis is to illustrate how the LBS preferences differ among various <b>user</b> <b>classes</b> and how the <b>user</b> <b>classes</b> may correlate. The main findings of the analysis are that the <b>user’s</b> background <b>class</b> has {{a significant impact on the}} preferences. Moreover, the high-level knowledge users have similar preferences as the high-level usage users, even though the correlation among the <b>user</b> <b>classes</b> is very low. Another interesting finding of this analysis is that the high-level knowledge users are relatively less willing to pay for LBS applications in comparison to the other <b>user</b> <b>classes.</b> From the privacy-concern based classification, it is observed that most of the users have certain privacy concerns, which represents one of the barriers in the LBS development. Finally, it can be inferred that the statistical analysis and the comparative results justify the empirical user classification derived in this thesis...|$|R

Further, dividing all the area segments into small square shaped cells of 40 -acre size, the small area growth trend is estimated with 'S-shaped' curve for 20 -year period. Here a piece-wise linear model is used to model the growth ramp segment of "S-shaped" growth characteristic. Finally two indices are proposed, one to estimate the new load demand, and other index to estimate the growth. The results obtained match the typical growth trend of different <b>user</b> <b>classes</b> for a practical distribution system...|$|R

For the general case of K <b>user</b> <b>classes,</b> the authors consider the problem of finding the optimal static policy, where for each <b>user</b> <b>class</b> a portion of the channel is dedicated.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{analyze the}} user {{accommodation}} capabilities of LTE-A systems with carrier aggregation for the LTE users and LTE-A users, respectively. The adopted performance metric is equivalent capacity (EC), {{defined as the}} maximum number of users allowed in the system given the user QoS requirements. Specifically, both LTE and LTE-A users are divided into heterogeneous <b>user</b> <b>classes</b> with different QoS requirements, traffic characteristics and bandwidth weights. Two bandwidth allocation strategies are studied, i. e., the fixed-weight strategy and the cognitive-weight strategy, where the bandwidth weights of different <b>user</b> <b>classes</b> are prefixed under the former and dynamically changing with the cell load conditions under the latter. For each strategy, closed-form expressions of ECs of different <b>user</b> <b>classes</b> are derived for LTE and LTE-A users, respectively. A net-profit-maximization problem is further formulated to discuss the tradeoff among the bandwidth weights. Extensive simulations are conducted to corroborate our analytical results, and demonstrate an interesting discovery that only a slightly higher spectrum utilization of LTE-A users than LTE users can result in a significant EC gain when the user traffic is bursty. Moreover, the cognitive-weight strategy is shown to outperform considerably the fixed-weight one due to stronger adaptability to the cell load conditions.

A signal model for heterogeneous networks with different <b>classes</b> of <b>users</b> and an arbitrary configuration of centralized antenna systems (CAS) and DAS is also introduced in this paper.
