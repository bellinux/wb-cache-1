25|$|The College began life as Hart Hall (Aula Cervina), a small {{tenement}} built roughly {{where the}} College's Old Hall is today, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>paces</b> along New College Lane {{on the southern}} side. In mediaeval Oxford, halls were primarily lodging houses for students and resident tutors. The land for Hart Hall was purchased by Elias de Hertford. Hertford College stands on land once owned by Walter Grendon, mercer of Oxford.|$|E

The Lakeland view is greatly {{restricted}} by Blake Fell {{although there is a}} vista of the Northern and North Western Fells. Loweswater is hidden by the slope although Crummock Water comes into view <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>paces</b> to the north east. The view of the coast, Isle of Man, Solway Firth and Criffel is uninterrupted.|$|E

25|$|One {{method of}} hunting sloth bears {{involved}} {{the use of}} beaters, in which case, a hunter waiting on a post could either shoot the approaching bear through the shoulder or on the white chest mark if it was moving directly to him. Sloth bears are very resistant to body shots, and can charge hunters if wounded, though someone of steady nerves could score a direct hit from within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>paces</b> of a charging bear. Sloth bears were easy to track during the wet season, as their clear footprints could be followed straight to their lairs. The majority of sloth bears killed in forests were due to chance encounters with them during hunts for other game. In hilly or mountainous regions, two methods were used to hunt them there. One was to lie in wait above the bear's lair at dawn {{and wait for the}} bear to return from its nocturnal foraging. Another was to rouse them at daytime by firing flares into the cave to draw them out. Sloth bears were also occasionally speared on horseback. In Sri Lanka, the baculum of a sloth bear was once used as a charm against barrenness.|$|E
500|$|Wolfe {{had ordered}} his {{soldiers}} to charge their muskets with two balls each {{in preparation for}} the engagement. Captain John Knox, serving with the 43rd Foot, wrote in his journal that as the French came within range, the regiments [...] "gave them, with great calmness, as remarkable a close and heavy discharge as I ever saw." [...] After the first volley, the British lines marched forward <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>paces</b> towards the shocked French force and fired a second general volley that shattered the attackers and sent them into retreat.|$|E
500|$|The runestone U 358 (...) in the RAK {{style was}} first {{mentioned}} by Richard Dybeck {{who discovered the}} stone in {{the foundation of the}} belfry of Skepptuna Church. The parishioners did not allow him to uncover the inscription completely, and they later hid the stone under a thick layer of soil. It was not until 1942 that it was removed from the belfry and was raised anew <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>paces</b> away. The stone is in light greyish granite. It is [...] tall above the ground and [...] wide. The contractor of the runestone was named Folkmarr and it is a name that is otherwise unknown from Viking Age Scandinavia, although it is known to have existed after the close of the Viking Age. It was on the other hand a common name in West Germanic languages and especially among the Franks.|$|E

2500|$|Kumar {{is said to}} {{have been}} {{paranoid}} about not being paid. During recordings, he would sing only after his secretary confirmed that the producer had made the payment. On one occasion, when he discovered that his dues had not been fully paid, he appeared on set with makeup on only one side of his face. When the director questioned him, he replied [...] "Aadha paisa to aadha make-up." [...] (Half make-up for half payment). On the sets of Bhai Bhai, Kishore Kumar refused to act because the director M V Raman owed him [...] 5,000. Ashok Kumar persuaded him to do the scene but when the shooting started, Kishore walked <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>paces</b> and said, Paanch Hazaar Rupaiya (five thousand rupees) and did a somersault. After he reached the end of the floor, he left the studio. On another occasion, when producer R.C. Talwar did not pay his dues in spite of repeated reminders, Kumar arrived at Talwar's residence shouting [...] "Hey Talwar, de de mere aath hazaar" [...] ("Hey Talwar, give me my eight thousand") every morning until Talwar paid up.|$|E

I did find Oliver's public announcement to Star City as the Green Arrow a little bit wonk. Because of the way the camera was aimed at him from the new lair, you could see so easily that it was Oliver Queen. However, with shows like Arrow, you got to suspend your disbelief a little bit, and besides, 'I am the Green Arrow' is something I have been waiting to hear for four years, so how much can I really complain? Arrow, I have missed you." ...|$|R

60|$|As {{he stood}} for a moment or two, irresolute, his ear, by this time attuned to the stillness, caught the faint but {{distinct}} lap and trickle of water. He was hot and thirsty, and turned instinctively in that direction. <b>A</b> very <b>few</b> <b>paces</b> brought him to a fallen tree; at the foot of its upturned roots gurgled the spring whose upwelling stream had slowly but persistently loosened their hold on the soil, and worked their ruin. A pool of cool and clear water, formed by the disruption of the soil, overflowed, and after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> yards sank again in the sodden floor.|$|R
5000|$|In Florence, {{the house}} of the Alighieri was <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>paces</b> from the cluster of tower houses of the Cerchi, which were {{restructured}} in the fourteenth century to form a rambling Palazzo dei Cerchi in the isolated block (insula) fronting via dei Cimatori and via della Condotta behind Piazza della Signoria. This was the power center of the Cerchi: their church was the little Santa Margherita dei Cerchi of which the arms of the patrons, Cerchi, Adimari and Donati, may still be seen on its thirteenth-century doorway. This was the church of Dante's Beatrice Portinari.|$|R

After <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more <b>paces,</b> they find the girl cat up a cliff and hanging onto a branch. To reach her, they stick a ladder {{on top of a}} boulder. Oswald climbs up and {{collects}} the feline. It turns out momentarily that the boulder is in fact a wolverine which wakes up and isn't happy to see them. Frightened by this, the dog runs off, carrying the ladder with Oswald and the girl cat still on it.|$|R

Then he froze into immobility, gazing with in awful, stony glare at the prostrate Hans, who lay within about fifteen feet of him. Scarcely was this aasvogel down, when others, summoned {{from the depths}} of sky, did as he had done. They appeared, they sank, they wheeled, always from east to west, the way the sun travels. They hovered for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> seconds, then fell like stones, pitched on to their beaks, recovered themselves, waddled forward into line, and sat gazing at Hans. Soon there was a great ring of them about him, all immovable, all gazing, all waiting for something.|$|R
60|$|As the boy thus led her by {{the hand}} in his quiet {{progress}} over the borders of eternity, Dorothy almost imagined that she could discern the near though dim delightfulness of the home {{he was about to}} reach; she would not have enticed the little wanderer back, though she bemoaned herself that she must leave him and return. But just when Ilbrahim's feet were pressing on the soil of Paradise he heard a voice behind him, and it recalled him <b>a</b> <b>few,</b> <b>few</b> <b>paces</b> of the weary path which he had travelled. As Dorothy looked upon his features she perceived that their placid expression was again disturbed. Her own thoughts had been so wrapped in him that all sounds of the storm and of human speech were lost to her; but when Catharine's shriek pierced through the room, the boy strove to raise himself.|$|R
60|$|The Captain {{remained}} in excellent spirits after the conversation which I have recorded. He {{appeared to be}} nervous and impatient, however, frequently changing his position, and moving his limbs in an aimless choreic way which is characteristic of him at times. In {{a quarter of an}} hour he went upon deck seven times, only to descend after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hurried <b>paces.</b> I followed him each time, for there was something about his face which confirmed my resolution of not letting him out of my sight. He seemed to observe the effect which his movements had produced, for he endeavoured by an over-done hilarity, laughing boisterously at the very smallest of jokes, to quiet my apprehensions.|$|R
