5|$|Feminism was {{challenged}} by various minority groups for not entirely <b>addressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> minority populations. It was suggested that 'mainstream' feminism was upper caste and Hindu in its orientation {{and did not}} address the concerns of minority women. This {{led to the formation of}} the Awaaz-e-Niswaan (The Voice of Women) in 1987 in Mumbai in largely Muslim part of the city. The Muslim community has personal laws that often were considered harmful to the rights of Muslim women. The Muslim personal law allows Polygamy but not Polyandry.|$|E

2500|$|In a January 2012 {{article for}} a Belgian news site, Pravit summed up current Thai politics, noting that any open {{criticism}} of the government had virtually vanished, with only anonymous criticisms being found online. He continued, stating that the red-shirt leaders, who were branded [...] "anti-monarchists" [...] by their opponents, had made public statements that they support a democratic system with the king {{as the head of}} state. He noted that in 2011 at least three issues of The Economist had been banned in Thailand, allegedly because of their critique of the Thai monarchy and that [...] "hundreds of websites critical of the monarchy are blocked by the state". Pravit cited four challenges to Thai democracy: taming the military, reshaping the role of the monarch, <b>addressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the poor and uneducated, and figuring out [...] "what to do with new political-business groups". Because of the ban on criticizing the monarchy, Pravit compared Thailand to a sick man needing treatment, but is unwilling to discuss his symptoms.|$|E
