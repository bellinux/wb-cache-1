40|$|Attitudes {{towards the}} land rights of Sami {{reindeer}} herders have changed considerably {{during the last}} 100 years. So, too, has consideration of how such rights should be treated by Land Consolidation Courts. This paper reviews changes in attitudes to the Sami land rights with respect to how these are considered in Land Con&not;solidation Courts in southern Sami areas in Norway. The review also considers changing attitudes regarding the competence of Land Consolidation Courts {{to deal with such}} matters. There were several cases in the 20 th Century in which Land Consolidation Courts treated Sami land rights in a restricted and unfortunate manner. Legal practice, however, was not always like that, evidenced by the so-called 'Finn line' (Norwegian: 'finnelinja' -'Finn' is an archaic name for Sami). This boundary was established during a land consolidation case in 1873 and was confirmed in 1883. At that time, Sami land rights were evidently accepted as <b>appurtenant</b> <b>right</b> in privately owned mountain pasture and the Sami were treated {{in the same way as}} others who enjoyed rights of usufruct on it. The regulation of 1883 included rules governing compensation for grazing damage on farming land. In particular, responsibility for grazing damage was divided between owners and the reindeer herders, providing these looked after their animals properly, 'The Finn line' subsequently achieved wider importance. The case of 1873 &not; 1883 has been referred to several times as a valuable and valid precedent for a way in which to organize grazing conflicts in other Sami areas. It was used in 1964 as evidence of the special rights of Sami reindeer people in the Brekken common land case. The Sami won this case in 1968 and, in its judgement, the Norwegian Supreme Court of Justice emphasised the importance of the line (Rt. 1968, p. 394). Although, owing to changes in land use practices, the 'Finn line' no longer has any practical significance, its juridical significance remains because it settles the principle that the rights of Sami reindeer herders' have to be considered in the same way as the rights of farming land owners. The ruling of 1873 - 1883 makes it clear that reindeer herders stand to gain important concessions, with respect to access to pasture, in land consolidation cases. The degradation of Sami land rights from the end of the 19 th Century was a consequence of political manipulation and had no basis in law. Attitudes have now changed and, consequently, there is a need to revise recent legislation, such as the 1978 Reindeer Husbandry Act with regard to rules for compensation for grazing damage on farming land, and the 1979 Land Consolidation Act concerning rules of land use...|$|E
50|$|Originally {{in medieval}} England the common was an {{integral}} part of the manor, and was thus part of the estate held by the lord of the manor under a feudal grant from the Crown or a superior peer, who in turn held his land from the Crown which owned all land. This manorial system, founded on feudalism, granted rights of land use to different classes. These would be <b>appurtenant</b> <b>rights,</b> that is the ownership of rights belonged to tenancies of particular plots of land held within a manor. A commoner would be the person who, for the time being, was the occupier of a particular plot of land. Some rights of common were said to be in gross, that is, they were unconnected with tenure of land. This was more usual in regions where commons are more extensive, such as in the high ground of Northern England or on the Fens, but also included many village greens across England and Wales. Most land with <b>appurtenant</b> commons <b>rights</b> is adjacent to the common or even surrounded by it, but in a few cases it may be some considerable distance away.|$|R

40|$|Arizona {{cities and}} urban {{developers}} in Arizona have been purchasing irrigated agricultural lands {{in recent years}} to obtain the lands' <b>appurtenant</b> water <b>rights</b> {{in order to meet the}} increased urban water demands. The objective of the study was to determine whether or not farmers who sold their land and water rights benefitted from the transactions based on a comparison of the price received with the value of the land and water rights in agricultural production. Results showed that the minimum price that a farmer could have accepted was a fraction of what the urban buyers paid. Included in the study was the effects of government commodity programs on the value of water in irrigated agriculture. The study concluded that for Arizona cotton growers, federal price support programs increased the returns to water significantly, which, in turn, increased the value of water to the Arizona cotton farmer. Price supports, therefore, kept the farmer's minimum price for land and water rights higher than had there not been price supports...|$|R
40|$|Irrigated agriculture's {{future in}} central Arizona is {{dependent}} upon the availability of two relatively fixed and limited resources: land and water. Adjustments within the agricultural sector will flow directly from, or in response to, changes in the availability and/or costs of these production factors. This study explores the agricultural use of these two factors of production and adjustments that will follow from their changing availability and cost over a 53 -year period from 1967 to 2020. The area of central Arizona under study encompasses two irrigation districts [...] the Salt River Project (SRP) and the Roosevelt Water Conservation District (RWCD). A structural model of the agricultural sector was synthesized from a survey of 102 operating farms in the study area. Models of four farm sizes were employed in a linear programming analysis to depict economies of scale. All four models were used to represent SRP farms, while two were used to represent RWCD farms. These farm models were held constant throughout the projection period, except for specified changes {{in the number of}} acres represented by each model (a decrease in land availability) in the SRP and the increasing water cost with which they are confronted in the RWCD. All other changes and/or adjustments wIthin agriculture are, in this analysis, dependent upon these land availability and water cost factors. Agricultural land and irrigation district surface and groundwater availability are considered factors exogenous to the agricultural sector. In the SRP, land and its <b>appurtenant</b> water <b>rights</b> have been and will continue over the projection period to flow into the urban-industrial sector {{at the expense of the}} agricultural sector. The cost of obtaining groundwater will increase over the projection period as the groundwater table declines. This increasing cost of groundwater will affect adjustments in agriculture in the SRP only slightly since water is provided to agriculture primarily through a user's cooperative which has excess electrical power revenues available to subsidize water prices to farmers. Increasing water costs in the RWCD will have a considerable affect on adjustments in agriculture because of the absence of revenue from any source to subsidize the cost of obtaining groundwater. Land availability is assumed constant in this district and, therefore, is of no significance in adjustments that occur over the projection period. Acreages of crops producing high values per acre-foot of water used are not affected by projected decreases in cropland and/or increases in water costs. Adjustments occurring within agriculture over the projection period take place in the acreages of those crops which produce a low net return per acre-foot of water used. As land availability decreases and/or water costs increase over the projection period, cropped acreage, total water use, and net revenue over variable production costs decline. The changes are not proportional since adjustments take place in the acreage of those crops which produce low values per acre and per acre-foot of water used. In the SRP, cropped acreage is projected to decrease 76 percent, total water use to decrease 71 percent, and net revenue over variable production costs to fall approximately 50 percent due largely to continuous transfer of land and water out of agriculture. Projected declines in cropped acreage in the RWCD are 50 percent, total water use decreases 45 percent and net revenue over variable production costs falls 21 percent due entirely to increasing cost of water. A second phase of this analysis presents a demand function for irrigation water in each district over price ranges from zero dollars per acre-foot to those at which no water would be demanded. In the SRP, positive price and quantity relationships were found to exist from a price of $ 248 per acre-foot at which quantity would be zero, to a quantity of 816, 873 acre-feet demanded at a zero price. Price and quantity relationships in the RWCD ranged from zero quantity demanded at a price of $ 113. 36 per acre-foot to a quantity of 130, 338 acre-feet at a zero price. A final section of this study treats various possible sources, uses, and values of additional water to agriculture in each irrigation district over the projection period...|$|R
