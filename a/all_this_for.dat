5|$|In their {{forty years}} of {{practice}} after leaving medical school, doctors hear about what works through ad hoc oral traditions, from sales reps, colleagues or journals. But those colleagues {{can be in the}} pay of drug companies– often undisclosed– and the journals are too. And so are the patient groups. And finally, academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure. Sometimes whole academic journals are even owned outright by one drug company. Aside from <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> <b>for</b> several of the most important and enduring problems in medicine, {{we have no idea what}} the best treatment is, because it's not in anyone's financial interest to conduct any trials at all.|$|E
500|$|The alto aria, [...] "" [...] (Ah, Lord, {{what is a}} human being), is {{accompanied}} by a solo oboe d'amore that [...] "expresses wonder about the nature of man" [...] and God's interest in him. The aria, as the first one, is not a da capo aria, but in two parts. The idea of man in a sinful condition which is presented first, is changed to redemption. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann relates the choice of the oboe d'amore to the answer to the singer's question [...] "Why do you do <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> man?": [...] "Aus Liebe" [...] (through love).|$|E
500|$|The {{royal family}} never fully {{accepted}} the Duchess. Queen Mary refused to receive her formally. However, Edward sometimes met {{his mother and}} brother George VI, and attended George's funeral in 1952. Queen Mary remained angry with Edward and indignant over his marriage to Wallis: [...] "To give up <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> that", she said. In 1965, the Duke and Duchess returned to London. They were visited by Elizabeth II, his sister-in-law Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, and his sister Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood. A week later, the Princess Royal died, and they attended her memorial service. In 1967, they joined the royal family for the centenary of Queen Mary's birth. The last royal ceremony the Duke attended was the funeral of Princess Marina in 1968. He declined an invitation from Elizabeth II to attend the investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1969, replying that Prince Charles would not want his [...] "aged great-uncle" [...] there.|$|E

500|$|By May 1941, Sinatra {{topped the}} male singer polls in Billboard and Down Beat magazines. His appeal to bobby soxers, as teenage girls {{of that time}} were called, {{revealed}} a whole new audience for popular music, which had been recorded mainly for adults up to that time. The phenomenon became officially known as [...] "Sinatramania" [...] after his [...] "legendary opening" [...] at the Paramount Theatre in New York on December 30, 1942. According to Nancy Sinatra, Jack Benny later said, [...] "I thought the goddamned building was going to cave in. I never heard such a commotion... <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> a fellow I never heard of." [...] Sinatra performed for four weeks at the theatre, his act following the Benny Goodman orchestra, after which his contract was renewed for another four weeks by Bob Weitman due to his popularity. He became known as [...] "Swoonatra" [...] or [...] "The Voice", and his fans [...] "Sinatratics". They organized meetings and sent masses of letters of adoration, {{and within a few}} weeks of the show, some 1000 Sinatra fan clubs had been reported across the US. Sinatra's publicist, George Evans, encouraged interviews and photographs with fans, and was the man responsible for depicting Sinatra as a vulnerable, shy, Italian–American with a rough childhood who made good. When Sinatra returned to the Paramount in October 1944 only 250 persons left the first show, and 35,000 fans left outside caused a near riot, known as the Columbus Day Riot, outside the venue because they were not allowed in. [...] Such was the bobby-soxer devotion to Sinatra that they were known to write Sinatra's song titles on their clothing, bribe hotel maids for an opportunity to touch his bed, and accost his person in the form of stealing clothing he was wearing, most commonly his bow-tie.|$|E

[...] After the women of the United States gained the right to vote, Burns retired from political life and devoted herself to the Catholic Church and her orphaned niece. [...] She died on December 22, 1966 in Brooklyn, New York.|$|E
2500|$|The {{events of}} October 1917 led to Gippius {{severing}} all ties {{with most of}} those who admired her poetry, including Blok, Bryusov and Bely. The history of this schism and the reconstruction of the ideological collisions that made such a catastrophe possible became the subject matter of her memoirs The Living Faces (Живые лица, 1925). While Blok (the man whom she famously refused her hand in 1918) saw the Revolution as a 'purifying storm', Gippius was appalled by the 'suffocating dourness' of the whole thing, seeing it as one huge monstrosity [...] "leaving one with just one wish: to go blind and deaf." [...] Behind <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> <b>for</b> Gippius, {{there was a kind of}} 'monumental madness'; it was all the more important for her to keep a [...] "healthy mind and strong memory," [...] she explained.|$|E

Reviewer Mark Hadley said he enjoyed the [...] "cheeky and full of quirky sideline segments, naming 'Fanboys vs. Haters' as his favourite, due to its demonstration that [...] "one man's chalk is another man's cheese". Despite the widely varying opinions of games, he stresses [...] "the joy of video games is their ability to test our physical, mental, even spiritual limits by taking us outside of ourselves". He has praised the inclusion of [...] "sensitive segments on cyber bullying within the gaming community and girls in games". He argues that as Good Game Spawn Point is [...] "particularly aimed at G and PG gamers", (meaning everyone – as all people can play G or PG games), he can watch the show with his children, allowing him the [...] "opportunity to connect" [...] part of the gaming conversation. Interviewer SteveMolk said, [...] "not only are Bajo & Hex becoming great story tellers in their own right, but Janet has drawn to the show a wider crew who are all gamers and skilled producers, editors, and special-effects wizards in their own right. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> a 'little gaming show'".|$|E
