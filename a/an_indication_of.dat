5|$|Sources {{are silent}} {{regarding}} the events following the first Persian campaign but the silence {{in itself is}} <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the peace that prevailed and that the Persians stopped being {{a threat to the}} Roman East. The evidence for the second campaign is meager; Zosimus is the only one to mention it specifically. A passage in the Sibylline Oracles is interpreted by Hartmann as <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the second invasion. The campaign took place in 266 or 267 and was aimed directly at Ctesiphon; Odaenathus reached the walls of the Persian capital but had to cancel the siege and march north to face the influx of Germanic riders attacking Anatolia.|$|E

5|$|<b>An</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the army's high esteem for barbarian-born troops is {{that they}} appear to have been {{preferentially}} recruited to the elite units of the late imperial era's armies. In the auxilia palatina infantry regiments, the proportion of barbarians in the ranks appears to have numbered anywhere between a third and a half of effectives (compared to a quarter in the army as a whole). From the late 3rd century onwards, barbarian recruitment became crucial to the army's continued existence, by providing a much-needed source of first-rate recruits.|$|E
5|$|An unusual {{element is}} that the tale draws its {{characters}} from essentially the same cast as Táin Bó Cuailnge, making mention of some thirty heroes from that narrative, yet never once mentions Cú Chulainn. Chadwick suggests this is probably <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the antiquity of {{the tradition of the}} story's tradition, predating the development of Cú Chulainn's story within the Ulster Cycle. Some of the rhetorical verse elements are old and obscure, but certain seemingly parodic elements of the genre at least suggest a later composition of the present form.|$|E

5|$|At an {{estimated}} , IK Pegasi B {{is considered to}} be a high-mass white dwarf. Although its radius has not been observed directly, it can be estimated from known theoretical relationships between the mass and radius of white dwarfs, giving a value of about 0.60% of the Sun's radius. (A different source gives a value of 0.72%, so there remains some uncertainty in this result.) Thus this star packs a mass greater than the Sun into a volume roughly the size of the Earth, giving <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> this object's extreme density.|$|E

She has released nine singles and an EP, and is working on her debut album for release in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Charles was ailing {{during the}} last years of his life. He died in Visegrád on 16July 1342. His corpse was first {{delivered}} to Buda where a Mass was said for his soul. From Buda, his corpse was taken to Székesfehérvár. He was buried in the Székesfehérvár Basilica a month after his death. His brother-in-law, CasimirIII of Poland, and Charles, Margrave of Moravia, were present at his funeral, <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> Charles's international prestige.|$|E

5|$|Competition with {{fishermen}} {{also led}} to killer whales being regarded as pests. In {{the waters of the}} Pacific Northwest and Iceland, the shooting of killer whales was accepted and even encouraged by governments. As <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently, about 25% of the killer whales captured in Puget Sound for aquarium through 1970 bore bullet scars. The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of killer whales in Icelandic waters in 1956 with machine-guns, rockets, and depth charges.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the engagements between 29 January and 1 February, the Coalition did not launch its main {{offensive}} into Kuwait and Iraq until the night of 24–25 February. The invasion of Iraq was completed about 48 hours later. The Battle of Khafji served as a modern example of the ability of air power to serve a supporting role to ground forces. It offered the Coalition <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the manner in which Operation Desert Storm would be fought, but also hinted at future friendly-fire casualties which accounted for nearly half of the American dead.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} Christianisation of the Rus', however, {{relations}} {{were not always}} friendly. The most serious conflict between the two powers was the war of 968–971 in Bulgaria, but several Rus' raiding expeditions against the Byzantine cities of the Black Sea coast and Constantinople itself are also recorded. Although most were repulsed, they were often followed by treaties that were generally favourable to the Rus', {{such as the one}} concluded {{at the end of the}} war of 1043, during which the Rus' gave <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> their ambitions to compete with the Byzantines as an independent power.|$|E

5|$|Globular {{clusters}} normally {{consist of}} Population II stars, {{which have a}} low proportion of elements other than hydrogen and helium when compared to Population I stars such as the Sun. Astronomers refer to these heavier elements as metals and to the proportions of these elements as the metallicity. These elements are produced by stellar nucleosynthesis and then are recycled into the interstellar medium, where they enter {{the next generation of}} stars. Hence the proportion of metals can be <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the age of a star, with older stars typically having a lower metallicity.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, a {{biochemical}} polymorphism {{study was}} conducted in four sample areas of the species. Electrophoretically demonstrable variation was found in one or more populations at 15 of 39 (38%) of the loci examined, and two and sometimes three alleles per locus were detected. At the least, the findings give <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the kind of genetic variation that may be found between populations within a species. The amount of variation was similar to findings in examinations of Peromyscus polionotus, Sigmodon, and Dipodomys.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{the risk}} parity {{approach}} has increased since the late 2000s financial crisis as the risk parity approach fared better than traditionally constructed portfolios, {{as well as many}} hedge funds.
