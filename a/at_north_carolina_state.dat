5|$|In {{its first}} game of the season, however, eighth-ranked Virginia Tech almost let those {{expectations}} fall short. <b>At</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>State,</b> the Hokies trailed at halftime and were tied {{at the beginning of the}} fourth quarter before eking out a 20–16 win in the final minutes. The Hokies bounced back from the close contest in their second game of the season—against the Duke Blue Devils—as Tech raced to a 45–0 victory.

SAS grew from $10 million in revenues in 1980 to $1.1 billion by 2000. A larger proportion of these revenues are spent {{on research and development}} than at most other software companies, at one point more than double the industry average.|$|E

25|$|Multimodality also obscures an audience’s {{concept of}} genre by {{creating}} gray areas {{out of what}} was once black and white. Carolyn R. Miller, a distinguished professor of rhetoric and technical communication <b>at</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>State</b> University observed in her genre analysis of the Weblog how genre shifted with the invention of blogs, stating that “there is strong agreement on the central features that make a blog a blog. Miller defines blogs {{on the basis of their}} reverse chronology, frequent updating, and combination of links with personal commentary. However, the central features of blogs are obscured when considering multimodal texts. Some features are absent, such the ability for posts to be independent of each other, while others are present. This creates a situation where the genre of multimodal texts is impossible to define; rather, the genre is dynamic, evolutionary and ever-changing.|$|E
