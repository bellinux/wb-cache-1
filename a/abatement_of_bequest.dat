40|$|Transfers in {{the form}} <b>of</b> <b>bequests</b> have {{important}} implications for the intergenerational transmission of inequality. Demographic change has relevant consequences for the timing and size <b>of</b> <b>bequests.</b> For example, longer life implies that people receive bequests when they are older. Conversely, increasing generational length reduces the average age at which people are given bequests. We analyze the consequences of demographic change in the United States for the timing over the life course when individuals receive an inheritance and for the size <b>of</b> <b>bequests.</b> We evaluate trends in life expectancy at the mean age at childbearing as a proxy for timing at receipt <b>of</b> <b>bequests.</b> We complement formal demographic analysis with empirical estimates from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) inheritance data for 1987 - 2010. We find that the long-term trend of increasing age at receipt <b>of</b> <b>bequests</b> and <b>of</b> increasing size <b>of</b> per-capita <b>bequests</b> received might have stalled, mainly because of changes in the timing of fertility. In the long term, the upward trend in age at which people receive bequests may resume as the expected linear gains in life expectancy would more than counteract recent increases in the mean age at childbearing. We showed that demographic change affects the size <b>of</b> <b>bequests</b> and the timing over the life course at which people receive them. As the need for economic resources varies over the life cycle, changes in the timing at receipt <b>of</b> <b>bequests</b> may have a differential impact on wealth inequality and affect patterns of multigenerational transfers of resources...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies three topics on bequests and bequest motives. It firstly {{documents the}} patterns and time trends <b>of</b> <b>bequest</b> distributions. Then this dissertation estimates the impacts <b>of</b> <b>bequests</b> and estate taxation on the income distribution of children. Thirdly this dissertation provides new evidence {{on a positive}} relationship between children and bequest motives and reconciles the new findings with different the mixed evidence in literature. On the distributions <b>of</b> <b>bequests</b> over time, this dissertation finds that bequests in aggregate are between 300 and 700 billions of 2012 dollars. Housing and financial assets dominant other bequeathable assets and account for over 60 percent <b>of</b> all <b>bequests.</b> Moreover, bequests are highly concentrated on the rich few that the top 10 percent decedents contribute over 60 percent <b>of</b> all <b>bequests</b> during 16 years. Finally, surviving spouses inherit almost all <b>bequests</b> <b>of</b> decedents and children inherit about 77 percent <b>of</b> all <b>bequests</b> if the decedents are single. Despite the significant aggregate scale <b>of</b> <b>bequests</b> and the nontrivial average annual income generated by inheritances, the impacts <b>of</b> receiving <b>bequests</b> and imposing estate taxes are trivial?no more than 3 percent?on the income inequality of children. The reason is that the annual income from inheritance is too small that account for only about 3 percent of the total income of children and their households on average. Last but not least, this dissertation finds that the opposite effects of the parents? belief of future help from children and the excessive financial burdens of some parents on bequest motives and actual bequests lead to negative findings on the relationship between having a child and having a bequest motive in literature. Finally this dissertation reconciles the new evidence with the mixed evidence <b>of</b> <b>bequest</b> motives in literature...|$|R
40|$|The French egalitarian law <b>of</b> <b>bequests</b> is {{a social}} device for distributing wealth from one {{generation}} to the other. The law <b>of</b> <b>bequest</b> is the result of a political debate within the Conseil d?État in which political considerations (the new democratic social state) are of considerable importance. However, the law <b>of</b> <b>bequests</b> takes into account the affective (within the family) and the economic dimensions. Grounded on historical material related to the 19 th Century, this paper examines what are these political, affective and economical dimensions and how they are inter related in the French context.

We must {{conclude}} {{from existing}} legal articles and research that bequest ownership is not resulting of inherit will (or determination) and ownership {{does not take}} place by his satisfaction. The ownership <b>of</b> <b>bequest</b> is enforcement and that is, take place by the law verdict, and inherit determination don’t have interference in it and death die is initialized of it. The major effect <b>of</b> <b>bequest</b> accepts and reject is, in charge of that debts are on the hereditary obligation and remained from him with death. In fact, accepting or rejecting <b>of</b> <b>bequest</b> is <b>of</b> declaration will, in respecting or not respecting to family financial and who to continue deceased way. The accepting or rejecting <b>of</b> <b>bequest</b> is the voluntary action,that does not take place without heir will The purpose of accepting or rejecting is: accepting or rejecting bequest managements that’s depends to demand capacity and free will of heirs...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a simple method for {{estimating}} the amount and the size <b>of</b> <b>bequests,</b> which is applicable to other countries as well, because it needs only four different kinds of published aggregate data.

Bequests, however, have continued to increase with ageing population from 40 to 60 per cent of net household assets and 30 to 40 per cent of national wealth even in the current recession.

40|$|Although recent {{research}} suggests that intergenerational transfers {{play an important role}} in aggregate capital accumulation, our under standing <b>of</b> <b>bequest</b> motives remains incomplete. The authors develop a simple model <b>of</b> strategic <b>bequests</b> in which a testator influences the decisions of his beneficiaries by holding wealth in bequeathable forms and by conditioning the division <b>of</b> <b>bequests</b> on the beneficiaries' actions. The model generates falsifiable empirical predictions that are inconsistent with other theories of intergenerational transfers. The authors present econometric and other evidence that strongly suggests that bequests are often used as compensation for services rendered by beneficiaries.

40|$|Actual inheritances are {{a hybrid}} of {{canonical}} types <b>of</b> <b>bequests</b> and, in particular, <b>of</b> accidental <b>bequests</b> and altruistic bequests. In this paper, a bequeathed estate consists of two components: an amount intended by altruistic parents and an amount which results from the “premature” death of parents. Altruistic parents can also invest in their children's education. Taxing those two types <b>of</b> <b>bequests</b> separately {{is known to have}} different implications. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to see the distributive incidence of estate taxation when those two components are indistinguishable.

The authors find that the distribution is highly skewed, so that the typical baby-boom person will receive a very modest inheritance. This {{is partly due to}} the skewed distribution of wealth and partly due to the tendency of the wealthy to have fewer children. But it is also due to anticipated dissaving: the authors estimate that households in the age band 70 - 74 will bequeath just 39 % of their wealth, consuming the rest before they die. ...|$|R
50|$|One {{reason that}} the {{recipient}} <b>of</b> a <b>bequest</b> is usually not taxed on the bequest is because the donor may be taxed on it.

40|$|Wealth {{transfer}} is taxable through {{two kinds of}} taxation, income taxation and wealth taxation. 　At the same time,wealth {{transfer is}} associated with four types <b>of</b> <b>bequest</b> motives, i. e., Life Cycle Bequest Motive, Strategic <b>Bequest</b> Motive, Joy <b>of</b> Giving <b>Bequest</b> Motive and Altruistic Bequest Motive. 　I investigate consistent taxation formulae for each <b>of</b> the four <b>bequest</b> motives, and examine the economic effects {{of these types of}} different motives. 　In effect, Life Cycle Bequest Motive and Joy <b>of</b> Giving <b>Bequest</b> Motive have formulae consistent with economic efficiency, while with the other two motives, formulae are not consistent with economic efficiency, which means we should modify these formulae in terms of economic efficiency. 　And consequently, the current inheritance tax system in Japan might be designed and modified as a quite efficient system. 　Also I point out that which type <b>of</b> <b>bequest</b> motives dominate in society is the key factor in evaluating the tax system...|$|R
