25|$|One day for {{the march}} I {{received}} this heavy old gun. A gun? And during a war? Never, I thought to myself. And leaned it against a hut. And walked away. But that stood out even in our group <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> don't know now how I got away with it, but somehow it worked. And so I got by unarmed.|$|E
25|$|Into the '60s, I {{was still}} not of a frame of mind {{that we were not}} only making music, we were making history. But I did {{recognize}} the impact because acts were going all over the world <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> recognized the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. I recognized that because I lived it. I would come to the South {{in the early days of}} Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.|$|E
25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

500|$|For his part, Rodgers {{recalled}} {{that he had}} first seen Madonna perform at a small club in New York in 1983. In an interview with Time magazine, Rodgers explained: [...] "I went to the club to see another woman sing, but when I got there Madonna was onstage. I loved her stage presence and then we met right after that. I kept thinking to myself, 'Damn, is she a star', but she wasn't <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> always {{wanted to work with}} her and Like a Virgin seemed like a perfect opportunity." ...|$|E
500|$|Had the Germans invaded Britain, Coward was {{scheduled}} to be arrested and killed, as he was in The Black Book along with other figures such as Virginia Woolf, Paul Robeson, Bertrand Russell, C.

When this came to light after the war, Coward wrote: [...] "If anyone had told me <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was high up on the Nazi blacklist, I should have laughed...

500|$|One day, whilst {{working on}} On the 6, Jennifer Lopez [...] "happened to be" [...] {{recording}} {{at the same}} recording studio where American recording artist Marc Anthony was recording. Anthony, who had become intrigued by Lopez after seeing her in Selena (1997), came into her studio {{and asked her to}} appear in the music video for his song [...] "No Me Conoces". She agreed, but only if he recorded a song with her, to which he in turn agreed. Lopez recalled the events on her [...] video album by stating: [...] "So <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> called Tommy [...] and I'm like 'Look, so Marc Anthony said he would do a song and I really don't want to do a duet with just anybody, I want to do a duet with him. So can you force him to sign something, so he has to do a record with me? If I do this video!'". The two first shot the video and then began working on the song.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, The Islamic Society in Denmark {{stated that}} they regretted their visit to Lebanon and Egypt in 2006 to show the caricatures because the {{consequences}} had been much more serious than they expected. In August 2013, Ahmed Akkari expressed his regret {{for his role in}} the Imams' tour of the Middle East, stating [...] "I want to be clear today about the trip: It was totally wrong. <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> was so fascinated with this logical force in the Islamic mindset that I could not see the greater picture. I was convinced it was a fight for my faith, Islam." [...] Still a practising Muslim, he said that printing the cartoons was ok and he personally apologised to the cartoonist Westergaard. Westergaard responded by saying [...] "I met a man who has converted from being an Islamist to become a humanist who understands the values of our society. To me, he is really sincere, convincing and strong in his views." [...] A spokesman for the Islamic Society of Denmark said [...] "It is still not OK to publish drawings of Muhammad. We have not changed our position." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} Greenwood High School, Miller became {{a student at}} Memphis State University in 1973, {{attending}} with a band scholarship. He played euphonium, but, during his two years at the university, Miller met pianists Donald Brown and James Williams, who {{introduced him to the}} music of well-known players such as Wynton Kelly, Bud Powell, and McCoy Tyner. Still at Memphis State, Miller attended a jazz workshop, where one of the tutors was his future bandleader, Woody Shaw, who stated that they would meet again in two years. They did meet again two years later, and Shaw remembered the young pianist. After leaving university in 1975, Miller took lessons privately in Boston with Madame Margaret Chaloff, who had taught many of the pianists that Miller admired. He later commented that, [...] "I should have stayed with her longer, [...] but <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was so restless, constantly on the move." [...] Miller played with saxophonists Ricky Ford and Bill Pierce in Boston. That winter, Miller was invited to Los Angeles by a school friend and decided to go, to escape the northern cold. He stayed on the West Coast for a year, playing locally in clubs and a church.|$|E

500|$|McGrady {{was born}} on May 24, 1979 in Bartow, Florida to Melanise Williford. His father was {{not a part of}} his {{everyday}} life, so Melanise raised McGrady {{with the help of her}} mother, Roberta, in Auburndale. As a youth, McGrady played high school basketball and baseball at Auburndale High School for three years before transferring to Mount Zion Christian Academy in Durham, North Carolina for his senior season. A relative unknown coming out of Florida, he made a name for himself after a strong performance at the Adidas ABCD Camp, an experience that helped McGrady recognize his true talent. He later reflected, [...] "Nobody had a clue who Tracy McGrady was. Sonny Vaccaro gave me that platform, and I played against the best players in the world <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> left that camp the No. 1 player in the nation, 175 to No. 1." [...] Behind his leadership, Mt. Zion emerged as the number two-ranked team in the country, and McGrady was named a McDonald’s All-American, national Player of the Year by USA Today, and North Carolina's Mr. Basketball by the Associated Press. Initially, McGrady considered playing college basketball at the University of Kentucky, but he ultimately decided to enter the NBA draft as he was a projected lottery pick.|$|E
500|$|While Green Day {{was nearing}} {{completion}} of Warning, the band {{announced it would}} be performing on the 2000 Vans Warped Tour during the summer before the album's October release. Although the group {{had been invited to}} perform on the tour before, the band was unable to do so due to scheduling conflicts. Because of Green Day's new stylistic change displayed on Warning, the band was considered an unconventional choice for the tour. Jason White, guitarist for Armstrong's side project Pinhead Gunpowder, was recruited to perform with the band to add [...] "more power" [...] to the group's sound; White observed that [...] "Even I was like, 'Why are Green Day on the Warped Tour?'". Fat Mike of NOFX recalled, [...] "They were the biggest band on the tour but it wasn't by far. [...] Green Day weren't super popular <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> think they did the Warped tour because they wanted to get popular again." [...] He also went on to call Warning [...] "probably their worst album, I think. It's what happens, the ups and downs." [...] However, Joel Madden of Good Charlotte, whose 2002 release The Young and the Hopeless outsold Warning, opined that [...] "I was definitely aware that our record at the time sold more maybe than their record but I think we idolized them so much that it didn't matter. [...] We thought Warning was one of their best records." ...|$|E
500|$|Heywood {{opened his}} defence on 17 September {{with a long}} {{prepared}} statement read {{by one of his}} lawyers. It began with a frank acknowledgement of his predicament: to be even accused of mutiny was to [...] "appear at once the object of unpardonable guilt and exemplary vengeance". His case rested on a series of arguments which, as historian Caroline Alexander points out, are not wholly consistent. First, Heywood pleaded his [...] "extreme youth and inexperience" [...] as the cause of his failure to join Bligh and the loyalists in the open boat, insisting that [...] "...I was influenced in my Conduct by the Example of my Messmates, Mr. Hallet and Mr. Hayward ... the latter, tho' he had been many years at Sea, yet, when Christian ordered him into the Boat he was ... so much overcome by the harsh Command, that he actually shed tears." [...] Heywood then cited a different reason for staying aboard Bounty: Bligh's launch was overloaded, and its destruction would be assured [...] "by the least addition to their Number". Finally, Heywood maintained he had intended to join Bligh but had been stopped: [...] "...on hearing it suggested that I should be deem'd Guilty if I staid in the Ship, I went down directly, and in passing Mr. Cole told him in a low tone of voice that I would fetch a few necessaries in a Bag and follow him into the Boat, which <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> meant to do but was afterwards prevented." ...|$|E
