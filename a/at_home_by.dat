5|$|San Marino's opening Euro 2008 {{qualifying}} match {{resulted in}} a record 13–0 defeat <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>by</b> Germany on 6 September 2006. They scored only twice and conceded fifty-seven goals in losing all twelve matches, although the home matches against Ireland, Cyprus and Wales were each lost by a single goal.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} Premier League debut on 17 August in Southampton's first match of the season, a 2–1 defeat away at Liverpool. One week later, Forster kept his first clean sheet {{for the club}} in a goalless draw against West Bromwich Albion <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> <b>By</b> mid-October, and after eight Premier League matches, Forster had kept four clean sheets and conceded only five goals, {{at that time the}} best {{defensive}} record in the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|In April 2004, San Marino gained their first, {{and as of}} September 2016 only, win {{in their}} 65th attempt, a 1–0 victory over Liechtenstein in a {{friendly}} on 28 April 2004 courtesy of a fifth-minute goal by Andy Selva. The match was Martin Andermatt's debut as Liechtenstein manager. Results during qualification for the 2006 World Cup followed a similar vein to previous qualifying groups. Matches were generally one-sided defeats, {{with the exception of}} single goal defeats <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>by</b> Lithuania and Belgium.|$|E

5|$|In {{comparison}} to their 2014 counterpart, the 2015 Bears were more competitive in games; in 2014, {{three of the}} worst losses were by 48, 28 and 21 points, while six of the 2015 team's losses were by less than a touchdown, two of which ended in overtime. The Bears ended the season 5–3 in away games, but won only once at home, the worst home record in team history. Additionally, the Bears were swept <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>by</b> division opponents {{for the first time}} since the NFL realignment in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Edward was tutored <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>by</b> Helen Bricka. When {{his parents}} {{travelled}} the British Empire for almost nine {{months following the}} death of Queen Victoria in 1901, young Edward and his siblings stayed in Britain with their grandparents, Queen Alexandra and King Edward VII, who showered their grandchildren with affection. Upon his parents' return, Edward was placed under the care of two men, Frederick Finch and Henry Hansell, who virtually brought up Edward and his brothers and sister for their remaining nursery years.|$|E
5|$|San Marino's first {{match in}} a FIFA sanctioned {{competition}} was against Switzerland on 14 November 1990 in a qualifier for the 1992 European Championships. San Marino lost 4–0, {{and went to}} lose all eight qualifiers. The team particularly struggled in away matches, losing every one by at least four goals. San Marino scored only one goal, a penalty in a 3–1 defeat <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>by</b> Romania, and conceded 33 goals in total.|$|E

5|$|She {{spent much}} of her {{childhood}} at St Paul's Walden and at Glamis Castle, the Earl's ancestral home in Scotland. She was educated <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>by</b> a governess until the age of eight, and was fond of field sports, ponies and dogs. When she started school in London, she astonished her teachers by precociously beginning an essay with two Greek words from Xenophon's Anabasis. Her best subjects were literature and scripture. After returning to private education under a German Jewish governess, Käthe Kübler, she passed the Oxford Local Examination with distinction at age thirteen.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Duchess and her {{siblings}} were taught <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>by</b> private tutors. Subjects included history, geography, Russian, English and French, {{as well as}} drawing and dancing. Physical activities such as equestrianism were taught at an early age, and they became expert riders. The family was deeply religious. Although Christmas and Easter were times of celebration and extravagance, Lent was strictly observed—meat, dairy products and any form of entertainment were avoided. Family holidays were taken in the summer at Peterhof and with Olga's grandparents in Denmark.|$|E
5|$|The North Eastern Railway (NER), one of {{the largest}} {{employers}} in the north of England, released over 18,000 of its employees to serve in the armed forces during the First World War, many of them joining the 17th (North Eastern Railway) Battalion of the Northumberland Fusiliers. By the end of the war, 2,236 men from the company had died on military service overseas; others were killed <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>by</b> bombardments of east coast ports, such as the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, and in the three Zeppelin raids on York.|$|E

5|$|Although Watts's {{work was}} seen as {{outdated}} and sentimental by the English Modernist movement, his experimentation with Symbolism and Expressionism drew respect from the European Modernists, notably the young Pablo Picasso, who echoed Hope's intentionally distorted features and broad sweeps of blue in The Old Guitarist (1903–1904). Despite Watts's fading reputation <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> <b>by</b> {{the time of his}} death in 1904 Hope had become a globally recognised image. Reproductions circulated in cultures as diverse as Japan, Australia and Poland, and Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States, displayed a reproduction in his Summer White House at Sagamore Hill. By 1916, Hope was well-known enough in the United States that the stage directions for Angelina Weld Grimké's Rachel explicitly use the addition of a copy of Hope to the set to suggest improvements to the home over the passage of time.|$|E
5|$|Childhood {{was brief}} and perilous, {{even more so}} for girls than boys. Parents would {{celebrate}} {{the birth of a}} boy twice as much and there is some evidence of female infanticide (i.e. roadside abandonment and suffocation), though it was contrary to both civil and canon law. Educational opportunities for girls were few: they did not attend regular schools but were taught in groups <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>by</b> tutors. With few exceptions, education was limited to literacy and the Bible; a famous exception is the princess Anna Komnene (1083–1153), whose Alexiad displays a great depth of erudition, and the renowned 9th century Byzantine poet and composer Kassiani. The majority of a young girl's daily life would be spent in household and agrarian chores, preparing herself for marriage.|$|E
5|$|Defender Luke O'Neill {{was signed}} from Burnley on a 28-day {{emergency}} loan. He made his debut in York's 3–0 win away to Torquay, {{which was the}} team's first successive win of the season. York were knocked out of the Football League Trophy {{in the second round}} after being beaten 3–0 <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>by</b> League One team Rotherham United, before their winning streak in the league was ended with a 3–0 defeat away to Newport County. York drew 2–2 away to Chesterfield, having taken a two-goal lead through O'Neill and Jarvis, before the home team fought back through Armand Gnanduillet and Jay O'Shea. The team then hosted Fleetwood Town, and the visitors won 2–0 with goals scored in each half by Gareth Evans and Jamille Matt. Scunthorpe United were beaten 4–1 at home to end York's three-match run without a win, with all the team's goals coming in the first half from Carson, Fletcher and Brobbel (2).|$|E

It was announced by the Marlins on June 15 {{that he would make}} his season debut on July 2. In his debut, Fernández recorded six strikeouts in six innings. He also hit a home run. Fernández returned to the disabled list in August with a biceps strain in his pitching arm. He returned to the mound in September and set a major league record for consecutive wins <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>by</b> a single pitcher with his seventeenth such win on the 25th of that month.|$|E
5|$|Following the sacking of Graeme Souness as Newcastle {{manager in}} February 2006, Bruce was again {{linked with the}} job, which {{ultimately}} went to Glenn Roeder. By {{this stage of the}} 2005–06 season, Birmingham were struggling in the league, and on 21 March 2006 were beaten 7–0 <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>by</b> Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Some supporters of the club began to call for his resignation, but Bruce insisted that he would fight on as manager. The team managed to climb out of the relegation zone {{for the first time in}} nearly six months after a win over Bolton Wanderers in early April 2006. However, they were soon overtaken by Portsmouth, whose victory over Wigan Athletic on 29 April left Birmingham mathematically unable to match their points total and therefore relegated.|$|E

Montreal's metropolitan area had a population of 4,098,927 and a population of 1,942,044 in the urban agglomeration, {{with all of the}} municipalities on the Island of Montreal included. French is the city's official language and is the language spoken <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>by</b> 49.8% {{of the population of the}} city, followed by English at 22.8% and 18.3% other languages (in the 2016 census, not including multi-language responses).

The agglomeration Montreal is one of the most bilingual cities in Quebec and Canada with over 59% of the population able to speak both English and French. Montreal is the second-largest primarily French-speaking city in the world, after Paris.|$|E

5|$|Lilian Faithfull {{was born}} in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, in 1865. Her father, Francis Faithfull, was a clerk at the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors. Her mother, Edith Lloyd, stayed home with eight {{children}} while also writing a History of England and magazine articles. Lilian was the second youngest of the six girls and two boys. She lived in an upper-middle class country house in Hertfordshire and was educated at The Grange in Hoddesdon (the only girl at the time), and later <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>by</b> her mother and governesses. Emily Faithfull, an early women's rights activist, was her cousin. Both of Faithfull's parents were opinionated about issues such as femininity and social class, but were not radicals.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{was born}} in Pinner, Middlesex on 4 March 1923 to Capt. Charles Trachsel Caldwell-Moore MC (died 1947) and Gertrude (née White) (died 1981). His family moved to Bognor Regis, and {{subsequently}} to East Grinstead where he spent his childhood. His youth was marked by heart problems, which left him in poor health and he was educated <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>by</b> private tutors. He developed an interest in astronomy {{at the age of}} six and joined the British Astronomical Association at the age of eleven. He was invited to run a small observatory in East Grinstead at the age of 14, after his mentor – who ran the observatory – was killed in a road accident. At the age of 16 he began wearing a monocle after an oculist told him his right eye was weaker than his left. Three years later, he began wearing a full set of dentures.|$|E
5|$|On 12 August, Tranmere were {{knocked out}} of the League Cup after a home defeat to the Championship side Nottingham Forest through a single first half goal. Rovers played with a {{numerical}} advantage for almost the whole second half after Michael Mancienne was sent off. In the next two games Tranmere was defeated by Shrewsbury Town 1–2 after two late goals and earned their first win and clean sheet at Wycombe Wanderers by scoring a goal either side of half-time. On 18 August, Edwards added to the squad with the first loan signing of the season, bringing young Saint Lucian defender Janoi Donacien over from Aston Villa until January 2015. Tranmere were defeated <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>by</b> Cheltenham Town 2–3 despite leading 2–0 at half-time. The first month of the season was concluded with a victory against 10-man Morecambe. Both goals were scored by Cole Stockton who extended his contract with Tranmere earlier that week till the summer of 2017.|$|E
