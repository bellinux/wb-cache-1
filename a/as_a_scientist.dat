5|$|At {{the end of}} the film, Arroway is {{put into}} a {{position}} that she had traditionally viewed with skepticism and contempt: that of believing something with complete certainty, despite being unable to prove it in the face of not only widespread incredulity and skepticism (which she admits that <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>scientist</b> she would normally share) but also evidence apparently to the contrary.|$|E
5|$|Because of Einstein's {{travels to}} the Far East, {{he was unable to}} {{personally}} accept the Nobel Prize for Physics at the Stockholm award ceremony in December 1922. In his place, the banquet speech was held by a German diplomat, who praised Einstein not only <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>scientist</b> but also as an international peacemaker and activist.|$|E
5|$|Like the Tom Swift, Jr. series, {{the series}} portrays Tom <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>scientist</b> {{as well as}} an {{inventor}} whose inventions depend on a knowledge of theory. The series differs from previous versions of the character, however, in that Tom's inventive genius is portrayed as problematic and sometimes dangerous. As Robert Von der Osten argues, Tom's inventions for this series often have unexpected and negative repercussions.|$|E

5|$|On {{its first}} {{broadcast}} in the United States on March 11, 2011, an estimated 3.76 million viewers tuned in, {{giving it a}} 1.5/5 ratings share for those between the ages 18–49. Critical reception to the episode was generally positive, as multiple critics noted that Ruck was well-cast <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>scientist</b> {{just trying to help}} his son.|$|E
5|$|While Leonardo's {{experimentation}} followed clear scientific methods, {{a recent}} and exhaustive analysis of Leonardo <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>scientist</b> by Fritjof Capra argues that Leonardo was a fundamentally {{different kind of}} scientist from Galileo, Newton and other scientists who followed him in that, as a Renaissance Man, his theorising and hypothesising integrated the arts and particularly painting.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his writing, {{at the time of his}} death Wallace had been for many years a {{well-known}} figure both <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>scientist</b> and as a social activist. He was often sought out by journalists and others for his views on a variety of topics. He received honorary doctorates and a number of professional honours, such the Royal Society's Royal Medal and Darwin Medal in 1868 and 1890 respectively, and the Order of Merit in 1908. Above all, his role as the co-discoverer of natural selection and his work on zoogeography marked him out as an exceptional figure.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>scientist,</b> Oppenheimer {{is remembered}} by his {{students}} and colleagues {{as being a}} brilliant researcher and engaging teacher who was the founder of modern theoretical physics in the United States. Because his scientific attentions often changed rapidly, he never worked long enough on any one topic and carried it to fruition to merit the Nobel Prize, although his investigations contributing {{to the theory of}} black holes may have warranted the prize had he lived long enough to see them brought into fruition by later astrophysicists. An asteroid, 67085 Oppenheimer, was named in his honor, as was the lunar crater Oppenheimer.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Verma was {{appointed}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>scientist</b> at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, where in 2001, he and Lalji Singh invented universal primer technology for wildlife identification, {{for which he}} later received a number of international patents, and several national awards including the CSIR Technology Award in 2008 (jointly conferred to Verma and Lalji Singh), the 2009 NRDC Award (jointly conferred on Verma and Singh) and the BioAsia Innovation Award in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In {{the view}} of Mary Beagon, writing in The Classical Tradition in 2010:the Historia naturalis has regained its status {{to a greater extent}} than at any time since the advent of Humanism. Work by those with {{scientific}} as well as philological expertise has resulted in improvements both to Pliny's text and to his reputation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>scientist.</b> The essential coherence of his enterprise has also been rediscovered, and his ambitious portrayal, in all its manifestations, of 'nature, that is, life'.. is recognized as a unique cultural record of its time.|$|E

In 1998, Verma was appointed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>scientist</b> at the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) where he continued his research on the DNA-based identification system, and in 1999, he received the Emerging Forensic Scientist Continental Award from the International Association of Forensic Sciences at the University of California, USA for his work on DNA microsatellite based identification of wild animals.|$|E
5|$|A {{doctoral}} student of Curie, Marguerite Perey, {{became the first}} woman elected to membership in the Academy– over half a century later, in 1962. Despite Curie's fame <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>scientist</b> working for France, the public's attitude tended toward xenophobia—the same that had led to the Dreyfus affair–which also fueled false speculation that Curie was Jewish. During the French Academy of Sciences elections, she was vilified by the right wing press who criticised her for being a foreigner and an atheist. Her daughter later remarked on the public hypocrisy as the French press often portrayed Curie as an unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a French honour, but would portray her as a French hero when she received a foreign one such as her Nobel Prizes.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>scientist</b> after {{becoming}} {{a member of the}} Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.|$|E

5|$|He {{was highly}} {{regarded}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>scientist</b> by the British, who {{wanted him to}} return to the United Kingdom to work on Britain's post-war nuclear weapons program; he returned in August 1946 and became the head of the Theoretical Physics Division at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell. From late 1947 to May 1949 he gave Alexander Feklisov, his Soviet case officer, the principal theoretical outline for creating a hydrogen bomb and the initial drafts for its development as the work progressed in England and America. Meeting with Feklisov six times, he provided the results of the test at Eniwetok Atoll of uranium and plutonium bombs and the key data on production of uranium-235.|$|E
5|$|The World Science Festival {{was founded}} by Brian Greene, a Columbia University physics {{professor}} and author of several popular-science books (such as The Elegant Universe), and his wife, Emmy Award-winning television journalist Tracy Day. Inspired by {{a visit to the}} 2005 Festival della Scienza in Genoa, where Greene had been invited to speak, the two decided that founding a similar festival in New York City would be a unique opportunity to bring science to the wider public. As they envisioned it, such a festival would allow them to combine Greene's skills <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>scientist</b> and science communicator with Day's as a journalist and producer: the events were meant to be rooted in science, but also to conform to the production standards of professional TV or theater productions.|$|E
