5|$|The heraldic {{term for}} an X-shaped cross is a 'saltire', {{from the old}} French word saultoir or salteur (itself derived from the Latin saltatorium), <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> both a type of stile {{constructed}} from two cross pieces and a type of cross-shaped stirrup-cord. In heraldic language, it may be blazoned azure, a saltire argent. The tincture of the Saltire can appear as either silver (argent) or white, however the term azure does not refer to a particular shade of blue.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "code word" [...] {{was used}} {{prominently}} in 1998 by Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz when he {{testified before the}} House Judiciary Committee, opposing the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Rep. Bob Barr said, [...] "Real America understands that the Constitution is there for a reason," [...] to which Dershowitz responded, [...] "Whenever I hear the words 'real Americans', that {{sounds to me like}} <b>a</b> code <b>word</b> <b>for</b> racism, <b>a</b> code <b>word</b> <b>for</b> bigotry, <b>a</b> code <b>word</b> <b>for</b> anti-Semitism." ...|$|R
25|$|The tribal {{names in}} kongo {{possibly}} derive from <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> a public gathering or tribal assembly. The modern {{name of the}} Kongo people or Bakongo {{was introduced in the}} early 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The capital(ization) sign {{marks the}} first letter of a word as capitalized. It may occur {{in the middle of}} <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> camel case, as in the name deAngelo. It is doubled to place a word in all caps; this must be {{repeated}} for each word of an all-cap text.|$|E
25|$|In 1907, Whitley Stokes {{suggested}} an etymology from Proto-Celtic *samani ('assembly'), cognate to Sanskrit sámana, and Gothic samana. J. Vendryes concludes that samain is unrelated to *semo- ('summer'), remarking that the Celtic 'end of summer' was in July, not November, {{as evidenced by}} Welsh gorffennaf ('July'). We would therefore be dealing with an Insular Celtic word for 'assembly', *samani or *samoni, and <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> 'summer', saminos (from *samo-: 'summer') alongside samrad, *samo-roto-.|$|E
5000|$|In Kannada, the {{official}} and chief language of Karnataka, oralu kallu is written as ಒರಳು ಕಲ್ಲು. The pronunciation of ‘lu’ in Oralu {{is not the}} same as ‘lu’ in [...] "flu". 'Lu' of Oralu Kallu is depicted as ‘ḷu’ in equivalent English. Oralu is <b>a</b> Kannada <b>word</b> <b>for</b> turn, which here describes the action of gundukallu, a grinding stone. ‘Kallu’ is <b>a</b> Kannada <b>word</b> <b>for</b> stone. An alternate name, rubbo kallu, is written as ರುಬ್ಬೊ ಕಲ್ಲು. ‘Rubbu’ is <b>a</b> Kannada <b>word</b> <b>for</b> grinding.|$|R
5000|$|Beshel as <b>a</b> <b>word</b> is <b>a</b> {{combination}} of [...] "Besh" [...] and [...] "eel". Besh (beş) is <b>a</b> Turkic <b>word</b> <b>for</b> the number five, and eel (ایل) is <b>a</b> Persian <b>word</b> used <b>for</b> tribes. Thus, Beshel could be translated as five tribes.|$|R

25|$|Hiligaynon, {{like other}} Philippine languages, employs reduplication, the {{repetition}} of a root or stem of a word or part of <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> grammatical or semantic purposes. Reduplication in Hiligaynon tends {{to be limited to}} roots instead of affixes, as the only inflectional or derivational morpheme that seems to reduplicate is -pa-. Root reduplication suggests 'non-perfectiveness' or 'non-telicity'. Used with nouns, reduplication of roots indicate particulars which are not fully actualized members of their class. Note the following examples.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to find a present-day parallel. The withholding of copyright, though only an indirect financial penalty, was both an official act and a hostile signal. We do not seem to have <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> this kind of indirect pressure, though suppression of dissent comes closer than censorship. Perhaps the modern 'naming and shaming' comes closest. The importance of respectability, reputation and public standing were critical in this case, as so often in traditional societies.|$|E
25|$|Another {{source for}} the concept may have {{originated}} from the translation of the Hebrew word re'em into Greek as μονόκερως, monokeros, in the Septuagint. In Psalm 22:21, the word karen, meaning horn, is written in singular. The Roman Catholic Vulgata and the Douay-Rheims Bible translated re'em as rhinoceros; other translations are names for a wild bull, wild oxen, buffalo, or gaur, but in some languages <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> unicorn is maintained. The Arabic translation alrim is the most correct choice etymologically, meaning 'white oryx'.|$|E

25|$|The inflected {{form of a}} word often {{contains}} both one or {{more free}} morphemes (a unit of meaning which can stand by itself as a word), and one or more bound morphemes (a unit of meaning which cannot stand alone as <b>a</b> <b>word).</b> <b>For</b> example, the English word cars is a noun that is inflected for number, specifically to express the plural; the content morpheme car is unbound because it could stand alone as a word, while the suffix -s is bound because it cannot stand alone as a word. These two morphemes together form the inflected word cars.|$|E
25|$|Wittgenstein {{rejects the}} idea that ostensive {{definitions}} can provide us with the meaning of <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> <b>For</b> Wittgenstein, the thing that the word stands for does not give {{the meaning of the}} word. Wittgenstein argues for this making a series of moves to show that to understand an ostensive definition presupposes an understanding of the way the word being defined is used. So, for instance, there is no difference between pointing to a piece of paper, to its colour, or to its shape; but understanding the difference is crucial to using the paper in an ostensive definition of a shape or of a colour.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{hallmarks}} of leet is its unique approach to orthography, using substitutions of other characters, letters or otherwise, to represent a letter or letters in <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> <b>For</b> more casual use of leet, the primary strategy is to use homoglyphs, symbols that closely resemble (to varying degrees) the letters for which they stand. The choice of symbol is not fixed—anything that the reader can make sense of is valid. However, this practice is not extensively used in regular leet; more often it is seen in situations where the argot (i.e., secret language) characteristics of the system are required, either to exclude newbies or outsiders in general, i.e., anything that the average reader cannot make sense of is valid; a valid reader should himself try to make sense, if deserving of the underlying message. Another use for Leet orthographic substitutions is the creation of paraphrased passwords. Limitations imposed by websites on password length (usually no more than 36) and the characters permitted (usually alphanumeric and underscore) require less extensive forms of Leet when used in this application.|$|E

500|$|According to Christopher Tolkien: [...] "the Eldar {{used two}} systems of numerals one of sixes (or twelves), {{and one of}} fives. (or tens)." [...] That is a {{duodecimal}} counting (base 12), and a decimal system. J.R.R. Tolkien coined <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> the 'decimal system of counting' maquanotie.|$|E
500|$|Hume was Huxley's {{favourite}} philosopher, {{calling him}} [...] "the Prince of Agnostics". Diderot {{wrote to his}} mistress, telling of a visit by Hume to the Baron D'Holbach, and describing how <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> the position that Huxley would later describe as agnosticism didn't seem to exist, or at least wasn't common knowledge, at the time.|$|E
500|$|In Connemara, the Aran Islands, and Munster, {{lengthening}} {{is found}} generally {{not only in}} the environments listed above, but also before nn (unless a vowel follows) and before m and ng at the end of <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> <b>For</b> example, the word [...] ('hole') is pronounced [...] in all of these regions, while [...] ('grip') is pronounced [...] in Connemara and Aran and [...] in Munster.|$|E

500|$|Njörðr's name {{appears in}} various place names in Scandinavia, such as Nærdhæwi (now Nalavi, Närke), Njærdhavi (now Mjärdevi, Linköping; both using the {{religious}} term vé), Nærdhælunda (now Närlunda, Helsingborg), Nierdhatunum (now Närtuna, Uppland) in Sweden, Njarðvík in southwest Iceland, Njarðarlög and Njarðey (now Nærøy) in Norway. Njörðr's name appears in <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> sponge; Njarðarvöttr (Old Norse [...] "Njörðr's glove"). Additionally, in Old Icelandic translations of Classical mythology the Roman god Saturn's name is glossed as [...] "Njörðr." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Gebeachan", {{the name}} that the Annals of Clonmacnoise ascribes to him, seems to {{represent}} either the Gaelic Gebechán, Giblechán, or Gébennach (the latter two attested by the fifteenthsixteenth-century Annals of Ulster in 890 and 973 respectively). Another possibility is that the name is derived from gebech, <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> a type of craftsman. Alternately, Gebeachan's name could be derived from a nickname referring to fetters or bondages. Whatever the case, the name is clearly Gaelic, which indicates that that Gebeachan was unlikely to have been from Orkney, and more probably centred in the southern Hebrides.|$|E
500|$|The {{historical}} {{importance of}} the Polish cochineal is still reflected in most modern Slavic languages where the words for the color red and {{for the month of}} June both derive from the Proto-Slavic [...] (probably pronounced [...] ), meaning [...] "a worm" [...] or [...] "larva". (See examples in the table below.) In the Czech language, as well as old Bulgarian, this is true for both June and July, the two months when harvest of the insect's larvae was possible.
