5|$|By mid-July, Maximilian and the Swabian leaders {{suddenly}} {{were under}} pressure from their own troops. In the west, where there lay an army {{under the command of}} count Heinrich von Fürstenberg, a large contingent of mercenaries from Flanders and many knights threatened to leave as they had not received their pay. The foot soldiers of the Swabian troops also complained: most of them were peasants <b>and</b> <b>preferred</b> to go home and bring in the harvest. Maximilian was forced to act.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the 1960s the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{considered}} new types of tactical transport aircraft to replace the RAAF's obsolete Douglas Dakotas. The Army wanted a simple and rugged aircraft that could be purchased immediately, and pressed for the acquisition of de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribous, but the RAAF regarded the Caribou as inadequate for the role <b>and</b> <b>preferred</b> a more sophisticated aircraft, leading to delays in the selection process.|$|E

5|$|Hardy often {{acted as}} a scout who would help bring {{supplies}} to troops on the front line. On September 25, 1918, he {{was present at the}} Meuse River during a mustard gas attack and, {{at some point during the}} war, he received an injury to his knee. Hardy rarely spoke about the fighting itself, <b>and</b> <b>preferred</b> to talk about France's weather when asked about his experiences overseas.|$|E
5|$|In 1974 most of River Oaks was {{assigned}} to River Oaks Elementary School. Prior to desegregation, it had around 800 children. After desegregation, many parents removed their children from River Oaks Elementary, and the school was far below capacity. In 1986 the neighborhood component of the school closed. At the time River Oaks had mainly older families. At the time the remaining families who did have children {{had the money to}} send their children to private school <b>and</b> <b>preferred</b> to do so.|$|E
5|$|In his journalism career Lie {{attempted}} {{to avoid the}} yellow press tactics used by his contemporaries <b>and</b> <b>preferred</b> to avoid extensive polemics in the press. Malaysian journalism historian Ahmat Adam, writing in 1995, notes that Lie's entry into the press sparked a wave of peranakan Chinese writers to become newspaper editors, and Sumardjo suggests that Lie remained best known to native Indonesians through {{his work in the}} press.|$|E

5|$|In the air, {{there were}} also two {{competing}} designs, originating from groups of different backgrounds and needs. The Army Signal Corps, representing military aviators, preferred a solution based on a stream of audio navigation signals, constantly fed into the pilots' ears via a headset. Civilian pilots on the other hand, who were mostly airmail pilots flying cross-country to deliver the mail, felt the audio signals would be annoying and difficult to use over long flights, <b>and</b> <b>preferred</b> a visual solution, with an indicator in the instrument panel.|$|E
5|$|Meyerbeer's large choral 'tableaux' {{also made}} a major {{contribution}} to the overall dramatic effect; the composer particularly sought opportunities to write such large-scale crowd scenes, <b>and</b> <b>preferred</b> libretti which offered such possibilities. Crosten writes: 'These massive developed sections are the chief glory of the Meyerbeerian opera, for {{they are not only}} big in volume but big in their structural design'.|$|E
5|$|Some early {{travellers}} found dodo meat unsavoury, <b>and</b> <b>preferred</b> to eat parrots and pigeons; others {{described it}} as tough but good. Some hunted dodos only for their gizzards, as this was considered the most delicious part of the bird. Dodos were easy to catch, but hunters {{had to be careful}} not to be bitten by their powerful beaks.|$|E

5|$|The {{trivial name}} acetic acid {{is the most}} {{commonly}} used <b>and</b> <b>preferred</b> IUPAC name. The systematic name ethanoic acid, a valid IUPAC name, is constructed according to the substitutive nomenclature. The name acetic acid derives from acetum, the Latin word for vinegar, and is related to the word acid itself.|$|E
5|$|As the day {{of their}} May 9, 1840, wedding approached, some family members still looked upon Houston with {{uncertainty}} and were determined to stop what they believed would be a disastrous union for Margaret. She would not be deterred, however, and the Reverend Peter Crawford officiated over the wedding of Margaret and the man {{with whom she had}} fallen in love. The newlyweds spent their honeymoon week at the Lafayette Hotel before sailing to Galveston, where Nancy and the Bledsoes had already established residences. Houston retained a house he owned in the city named for him, but Margaret had no taste for the hustle and bustle <b>and</b> <b>preferred</b> the lesser-populated Galveston. She and her personal slaves, who had accompanied the newlyweds from Alabama, shared her mother's house while Houston traveled.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though most}} {{consumer}} items {{are in short}} supply in North Korea, there is a considerable variety of cigarettes available. In general, strong tobacco is preferred, and filters are rare. Western brands, particularly American, but also Chinese, Russian and Japanese are popular with the elite <b>and</b> <b>preferred</b> over domestic cigarettes. Foreign cigarettes and the domestic 727 brand, whose name stands for 27 July, the date of the Korean Armistice Agreement, are veritable status symbols. Menthol cigarettes are virtually non-existent, but there is competition among tobacco companies to introduce other attractive products, such as fruit-flavoured balls inside the filter to give the cigarette flavour.|$|E
5|$|George {{donated the}} royal library to the British Museum in 1757, {{four years after}} the museum's foundation. He had no {{interest}} in reading, or in the arts and sciences, <b>and</b> <b>preferred</b> to spend his leisure hours stag-hunting on horseback or playing cards. In 1737, he founded the Georg August University of Göttingen, the first university in the Electorate of Hanover, and visited it in 1748. The asteroid 359 Georgia was named in his honour at the University in 1902. He served as the Chancellor of Trinity College, Dublin, between 1716 and 1727, and in 1754 issued the charter for King's College in New York City, which later became Columbia University. The province of Georgia, founded by royal charter in 1732, was named after him.|$|E
5|$|Holst's {{works were}} played {{frequently}} {{in the early years}} of the 20th century, but it was not until the international success of The Planets in the years immediately after the First World War that he became a well-known figure. A shy man, he did not welcome this fame, <b>and</b> <b>preferred</b> to be left in peace to compose and teach. In his later years his uncompromising, personal style of composition struck many music lovers as too austere, and his brief popularity declined. Nevertheless, he was a significant influence on a number of younger English composers, including Edmund Rubbra, Michael Tippett and Benjamin Britten. Apart from The Planets and a handful of other works, his music was generally neglected until the 1980s, when recordings of much of his output became available.|$|E

5|$|In 1729, the Royal Naval Academy in Portsmouth– {{renamed the}} Royal Naval College in 1806– was founded, for 40students aged between 13 and 16, {{who would take}} three years to {{complete}} a course of study defined in an illustrated book, and would earn two years of sea time {{as part of their}} studies. The rating of midshipman-by-order, or midshipman ordinary, was used specifically for graduates of the Royal Naval College, to distinguish them from midshipmen who had served aboard ship, who were paid more. The school was unpopular in the Navy, because officers enjoyed the privilege of having servants <b>and</b> <b>preferred</b> the traditional method of training officers via apprenticeship.|$|E
5|$|In 1862, Theodore Gill {{placed the}} winghead shark {{in its own}} genus Eusphyra, derived from the Greek eu ("good") and sphyra ("hammer"). However, {{subsequent}} authors did not accept Eusphyra <b>and</b> <b>preferred</b> to keep this species with the other hammerheads in the genus Sphyrna. Eusphyra was resurrected by Henry Bigelow and William Schroeder in 1948, and came into wider usage after additional taxonomic research was published by Leonard Compagno in 1979 and 1988. Nevertheless, some sources still refer to this species as Sphyrna blochii. Other common names for the winghead shark include arrowhead, arrow-headed hammerhead shark, and slender hammerhead.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, {{when the}} new {{communist}} regime outlawed the Greek-Catholic Church and forcibly merged it into the Orthodox Church, Agârbiceanu refused to join the latter denomination, thus setting himself up against the authorities. However, these found {{his reputation as a}} writer valuable for their own interests, <b>and</b> <b>preferred</b> to try and co-opt him. In 1953, after a five-year marginalization for his refusal to turn Orthodox, Agârbiceanu joined the editorial board of Anatol E. Baconsky's semi-official literary magazine, Steaua. He was granted the Order of Labor the following year, and promoted to titular member of the Academy in 1955. On the occasion of his 80th birthday in 1962, he was also awarded the Order of the Star of the Romanian People's Republic, first class.|$|E
