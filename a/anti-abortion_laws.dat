Ullman case, which addressed a state statute outlawing contraception. The issue arose again in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), {{and this time the}} Supreme Court adopted the ACLU's position, and formally declared a {{right to privacy}}. The New York affiliate of the ACLU pushed to eliminate <b>anti-abortion</b> <b>laws</b> starting in 1964, a year before Griswold was decided, and in 1967 the ACLU itself formally adopted the right to abortion as a policy. The ACLU led the defense in United States v. Vuitch which expanded the right of physicians to determine when abortions were necessary. These efforts culminated {{in one of the most}} controversial Supreme Court decisions of all time, Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in the first three months of pregnancy. The ACLU successfully argued against state bans on interracial marriage, in the case of Loving v. Virginia (1967).|$|E

2500|$|There were {{a number}} of factors that contributed to this shift in opinion about {{abortion}} in the early 19th century. In the United States, where physicians were the leading advocates of abortion criminalization laws, advances in medical knowledge {{played a significant role in}} influencing anti-abortion opinion. Science had discovered that conception inaugurated a more or less continuous process of development, which would produce a new human being if uninterrupted. Moreover, quickening was found to be neither more nor less crucial in the process of gestation than any other step. On a logical basis, many physicians concluded that if society considered it unjustifiable to terminate pregnancy after the fetus had quickened, and if quickening was a relatively unimportant step in the gestation process, then it was just as wrong to terminate a pregnancy before quickening as after quickening. Ideologically, the Hippocratic Oath and the medical mentality of that age to defend the value of human life as an absolute, also played a significant role in molding opinions about abortion. Practical reasons also influenced the medical field to impose <b>anti-abortion</b> <b>laws.</b> For one, abortion providers tended to be untrained and not members of medical societies. In an age where the leading doctors in the nation were attempting to standardize the medical profession, these [...] "irregulars" [...] were considered a nuisance to public health. The [...] "irregulars" [...] were also disliked by the more formalized medical profession because they were competition, and often cheap competition. Though the physician's campaign against abortion began in the early 1800s, little progress was made in the United States until after the Civil War.|$|E
