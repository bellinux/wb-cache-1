5|$|According to Richard Maxwell Eaton, {{author of}} A Social History of the Deccan, Vithoba was first worshipped as a {{pastoral}} god {{as early as}} the 6th century. Vithoba's arms-akimbo iconography is similar to Bir Kuar, the cattle-god of the Ahirs of Bihar, who is now <b>also</b> <b>associated</b> with Krishna. Vithoba was probably later assimilated into the Shaiva pantheon and identified with the god Shiva, like most other pastoral gods. This is backed by the facts that the temple at Pandharpur is surrounded by Shaiva temples (most notably of the devotee Pundalik himself), and that Vithoba is crowned with the Linga, symbol of Shiva. However, since the 13th century, the poet-saints like Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram identified Vithoba with Vishnu.|$|E
5|$|Along these lines, some {{academics}} {{link the}} Gawain pentangle to magical traditions. In Germany, the symbol {{was called a}} Drudenfuß and was placed on household objects to keep out evil.

However, concrete evidence tying the magical pentagram to Gawain's pentangle is scarce.|$|E

The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are <b>also</b> <b>associated</b> with gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E
