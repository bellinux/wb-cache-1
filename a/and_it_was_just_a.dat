500|$|Leonard Boyarsky, art {{director}} of the original Fallout, when asked about Interplay Entertainment's sale of the rights to Bethesda Softworks, said [...] "To be perfectly honest, I was extremely disappointed {{that we did not}} get the chance to make the next Fallout game. This {{has nothing to do with}} Bethesda, it's just that we've always felt that Fallout was ours <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> technicality that Interplay happened to own it. It sort of felt as if our child had been sold to the highest bidder, and we had to just sit by and watch. Since I have absolutely no idea what their plans are, I can't comment on whether I think they're going in the right direction with it or not.".|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} Mueller gave different reasons for leaving, [...] "One {{is that the}} decision {{had been made to}} terminate the Apollo program, and that was a good time then to leave before, and let someone else take over for the next phase. From a practical point of view, I needed to go make some money so I could keep my family going. It was costly for us to join the Apollo program. My salary was half what I was making in industry when I went there, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> strain to keep the family going and work going at the same time. So I went back to industry.".|$|E

2500|$|On defense, the Wolverines {{became the}} first team to hold the Buckeyes {{scoreless}} since 1964. [...] They held Ohio State to 173 yards of total offense, including 101 rushing yards and only five pass receptions. [...] Defensive tackle Greg Morton led the team with 14 tackles, and Jim Pickens and Jerry Zuver each had an interception. [...] Late in the second quarter, with the game still scoreless, Ohio State drove the ball to the Michigan 10-yard line when Pickens intercepted a pass in the end zone. [...] After the game, Woody Hayes cited Pickens' interception as a turning point: [...] "The interception {{at the end of the}} first half was a costly error on our part. [...] It was my call all the way, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> bad call. [...] If we had scored then, it might have affected the second half outcome." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both Kate Blanchard and Scholz {{note that}} there are several {{passages}} in the Book of Isaiah, Book of Jeremiah, and Book of Ezekiel that utilize rape metaphors. Blanchard expressed outrage over this fact, writing [...] "The translations of these shining examples of victim-blaming are clear enough, despite the old-fashioned language: I'm angry and you're going to suffer for it. You deserve to be raped because of your sexual exploits. You're a slut <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> matter of time till you suffered the consequences. Let this be a lesson {{to you and to}} all other uppity women." [...] Scholz discussed four passages—Isaiah 3:16-17, Jeremiah 13:22 and 26, Ezekiel 16, and Ezekiel 23. On Isaiah, Scholz wrote that there is a common mistranslation of the Hebrew word pōt as [...] "forehead" [...] or [...] "scalp". Also often translated as [...] "genitals", Scholz believes that a more accurate translation of the word in context is [...] "cunt". Regarding Jeremiah, Scholz wrote, [...] "The poem proclaims that the woman brought this fate upon herself and she is to be blamed for it, while the prophet sides with the sexually violent perpetrators, viewing the attack as deserved and God as justifying it. Rape poetics endorses 'masculine authoritarianism' and the 'dehumanization of women,' perhaps especially when the subject is God." ...|$|E

Ah, it's a bad time! My sister says you are going west, but I see you have got your cart full of garden truck.

"I {{can tell}} you, lad," [...] the latter said one day, when, after passing St. Louis, they {{had entered the}} waters of the Missouri, [...] "thar have been changes on this river since I was a youngster.

I used to go up sometimes with traders, but I never liked the job: first, I didn't like selling 'fire-water,' as they called it, to the Indians, for it made them mad, and brought on quarrels and wars; in the next place, it was a dangerous business. The Indians used to meet the traders at some place they had appointed beforehand, and there would be big feastings; sometimes the traders would come back with the boat loaded up with buffalo robes and skins, and Indian blankets, and such like; once or twice they didn't come back at all, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> mercy that I didn't stay behind with them on one of the trips.|$|E
6000|$|These were immense {{excursions}} for {{the spirit}} of a young person at Mrs. Lowder's mere dinner-party; but what was so significant and so admonitory as the fact of their being possible? What could they have been but just a part, already, of the crowded consciousness? <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> part, likewise, that while plates were changed and dishes presented and periods in the banquet marked; while appearances insisted and phenomena multiplied and words reached her from here and there like plashes of a slow, thick tide; while Mrs. Lowder grew somehow more stout and more instituted and Susie, at her distance and in comparison, more thinly improvised and more different--different, that is, from every one and everything: it was just a part that while this process went forward our young lady alighted, came back, taking up her destiny again {{as if she had been}} able by a wave or two of her wings to place herself briefly in sight of an alternative to it. Whatever it was it had showed in this brief interval as better than the alternative; and it now presented itself altogether in the image and in the place in which she had left it. The image was that of her being, as Lord Mark had declared, a success. This depended more or less of course on his idea of the thing--into which at present, however, she wouldn't go. But, renewing soon, she had asked him what he meant then that Mrs. Lowder would do with her, and he had replied that this might safely be left. [...] "She'll get back," [...] he pleasantly said, [...] "her money." [...] He could say it too--which was singular--without affecting her either as vulgar or as [...] "nasty [...] "; and he had soon explained himself by adding: [...] "Nobody here, you know, does anything for nothing." ...|$|E
