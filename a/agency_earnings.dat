40|$|The {{decision}} {{to work and}} its levels of intensity are estimated for the real estate brokerage industry where workers can set their own hours. A three-stage model of the brokerage labor market is presented with decisions made recursively between full- and part-time status, wage offers and hours worked. The application is to data from a cross-sectional survey of 6, 842 real estate licensees in the United States for 1999. Conditional on self-selection, an expected wage for real estate licensees is estimated given skills and personal characteristics. That expected wage enters the supply-side equation {{for the number of}} hours worked. The findings indicate that skills such as education, experience and licensee status are related to higher wages, but there is a negative self-selection in wages: part-time workers have higher unmeasured skills. Schooling and experience decreases hours worked, consistent with increasing efficiency. The resulting labor supply elasticity with respect to the wage is 0. 24.

40|$|Abstract: This thesis {{explores the}} {{goodwill}} impairment practices of Australian companies from 2007 – 2013 to ascertain what impact, if any, that the Global Financial Crisis {{may have had}} on goodwill value. The thesis also examines determinants of goodwill and whether there is any evidence of earnings management associated with non-impairment of goodwill. The findings contained within this thesis {{would be useful to}} accounting practitioners, auditors, academics, policy makers and regulators to gain an understanding of how and why firms choose to impair. The thesis is presented in seven chapters. Chapter one provides an introduction to the outline of the thesis including justification for the research and its relationship to practice based outcomes. Chapter two provides a background to the current goodwill environment and then reviews the extant literature surrounding goodwill and impairment, including <b>agency</b> theory, <b>earnings</b> management and signaling theory. Chapter three provides a technical review of the accounting standards surrounding goodwill and impairment and considers conceptual incongruities within the standards related to internally generated goodwill. Chapter four provides a breakdown of the sample selection and goodwill impairment from 2007 – 2013 using a sample of 237 All Ordinaries listed companies and observes non impairment in 35...|$|R
40|$|We extend Ohlson's (1995) {{model and}} examine the {{relationship}} between returns and residual income that incorporate analysts earnings forecasts and other non-earnings information variables in the balance sheet, namely default probability and agency cost of a debt covenant contract. We further divide the sample based on bankruptcy (<b>agency)</b> costs, <b>earnings</b> components and growth opportunities of a firm to explore how these factors affect the returns-residual income link. We find that the relative predictive ability for contemporaneous price by considering other earnings and non-earnings information is better than that of models without non-earnings information. If the bankruptcy (agency) cost of a firm is higher, its information role in the firm's equity valuation becomes more important and the accuracy of price prediction is therefore higher. As for non-earnings information, if bankruptcy (agency) cost is lower. the information role becomes more relevant, and the earnings response coefficient is hence higher. Moreover, the decomposition of unexpected residual income into permanent and transitory components induces more information than that of the Unexpected residual income alone. The permanent component has a larger impact than the transitory component in explaining abnormal returns. The market and industry properties and growth opportunity also have incremental explanatory power in valuation. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use a}} very large matched {{database}} on firms and employees to analyze the use of temporary agencies by low earners, and to estimate the impact of temp employment on subsequent employment outcomes for these workers. Our results show that, while temp workers have lower earnings than others while working at these <b>agencies,</b> their subsequent <b>earnings</b> are often higher - {{but only if they}} manage to gain stable work with other employers. Furthermore, the positive effects seem mostly to occur because those working for temp agencies subsequently gain access to higher-wage firms than do comparable low earners who do not work for temps. The positive effects we find seem to persist for up to six years beyond the period during which the temp employment occurred. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this review}} article, we bring {{together}} {{a number of}} aspects of family firms that are ubiquitous {{in a number of}} institutional contexts, often as part of larger business groups. We pay particular attention to the mechanisms by which families retain control over firms, and the incentives of the families in control to expropriate other stakeholders by way of tunnelling. We examine the role of earnings management in facilitating tunnelling, and evidence about the incidence of earnings management in family firms. Our review suggests that while the literature on these aspects of family control is rich, the contexts in which the empirical exercises are undertaken are relatively few, and hence there is considerable opportunity to expand it to other contexts, in particular in the form of cross-country comparisons of the relative impact of agency conflicts and institutions on these issues. family control, group affiliation, <b>agency</b> problem, tunnelling, <b>earnings</b> management...|$|R
40|$|Free {{cash flow}} has been {{identified}} as having {{the potential to be a}} major agency cost where managers make expenditures that have negative NPVs. This agency problem reduces profitability and lowers stock market valuations. We argue that firms with high free cash flow and poor growth opportunities will suffer from the free cash flow agency problem. Our results are consistent with expectations and show that firms with high free cash flow and low growth are associated with low long term profitability. We also find that managers use income-decreasing accruals when a firm has high free cash flow <b>agency</b> costs. This <b>earnings</b> management is motivated by managers' desire to shift profits to future years when the full impact of the sub-optimum investments hits earnings. The evidence supports Fudenberg and Tirole's (1995) managerial self interest hypothesis. Consistent with the institutional investor monitoring hypothesis, we show that institutional shareholders act to deter managers from using negative discretionary accruals when free cash flow agency costs are potentially high.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the <b>agency</b> problem, <b>earnings</b> {{management}} may take place due to the high contracting costs, shareholders’ bounded rationalities, and information asymmetry. Therefore, three main groups of motives have been identified to explain earnings management behaviour at the contracting, capital market, and external levels. While the previous studies have individually examined those motives, this thesis provides evidence that they interact in determining earnings management behaviour. The first empirical chapter of this thesis focuses on the contracting factors and examines the impact of earnings management on executive compensation conditioned on managerial ability. It finds that managers who utilize accrual earnings management receive higher compensation than those who undertake real earnings management. However, high quality managers are rewarded less for accrual earnings management and punished less for real earnings management. The second empirical chapter examines the non-linear effect of market concentration as an external motive of earnings management. It documents that accrual earnings management increases in concentrated markets as the quantity of information decreases. However, the sophisticated real earnings management starts to substitute for discretionary accruals at higher levels of market concentration when the quality of information declines. The third empirical chapter combines factors from the contracting and external motives. It examines the effect of market competition on the relationship between managerial ability and earnings management. The results show that in the face of increased competition, high quality managers manipulate earnings via accruals rather than more costly real earnings management. Overall, the results of this thesis show that management compensation is a crucial factor in assessing the costs of earnings management at the firm level. An optimal level of market concentration exists and should be considered by the regulators. Finally, understanding how industry level factors influence managerial decisions at the firm level is essential to explaining earnings management behaviour. ...|$|R
40|$|Earnings {{management}} has had consequence in financial disasters, such as Enron, WorldCom and Nortel. More recently, it is alleged in the Lehman bankruptcy, which {{ushered in a}} global financial meltdown. Yet despite increased regulation and focus on governance and auditing, researchers find that earnings management remains a common practice. Accounting academics {{have responded to the}} earnings management problem by conducting studies using secondary data for governance variables and financial models to measure earnings management indirectly. Meanwhile, governance variables measured with secondary data now show little variability because of improved best practice and regulation, and there is strong evidence that the agency causal model and the earnings management measures are seriously flawed. This study uses a mixed-mode research model based on agency and stewardship theory to explain earnings management, and uses a more direct measure of its occurrence, namely the level of board information asymmetries and board monitoring and control actions, as a proxy for earnings management. Primary data is used to provide direct measures of important governance variables, which produce mixed results relative to earnings management using secondary data. In a survey of 245 Canadian public company directors, this study finds that an independent chair, less busy directors, and a smaller board does reduce earnings management, but that this impact is strongly moderated by the CEO 2 ̆ 7 s attributes. A CEO with stewardship attributes reduces earnings management, and a CEO with <b>agency</b> attributes increases <b>earnings</b> management. There also is evidence in the study that agency conflict variables improve governance outcomes, in this case, reducing the level of earnings management, and that board processes around monitoring and control actions could be a problem...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Federal interagency contract service programs are being used {{in a wide variety}} of situations, from those in which a single agency provides limited contracting assistance to an approach in which the provider agency's contracting officer handles all aspects of the procurement. This increased use of interagency contracts is a result of reforms and legislation passed in the 1990 s, allowing agencies to streamline the acquisition process, operate more like businesses, and offer increasing numbers of services to other agencies. Most of the contract service programs GAO reviewed reported an excess of revenues over costs in at least one year between fiscal years 1999 and 2001. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance directs agencies with governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWAC) or franchise fund programs to account for and recover fully allocated actual costs and to report on their financial results. Agencies are to identify all direct and indirect costs and charge fees to ordering agencies based on these costs. However, some GWAC programs have not identified or accurately reported the full cost of providing interagency contract services. OMB's guidance further directs that <b>agencies</b> return GWAC <b>earnings</b> to the miscellaneous receipts account of the U. S. Treasury's General Fund. However, this guidance conflicts with the operations of agencies' revolving funds, which were established by statutes that allow retention of excess revenues. The Federal Supply Schedules program has generated hefty earnings, largely because of the rapid growth of information technology sales. Rather than adjust the fee, however, the General Services Administration has used the earnings primarily to support its stock and fleet programs. However, the significant amount of earnings means that Federal Supply Schedules program customers are being consistently overcharged for the contract services they are buying. ...|$|R
40|$|After the {{adoption}} of IFRS 3 and IAS 36 in 2005, goodwill and its related impairment have been criticized recently about their reliability and the true presentation of the economic value on the company’s financial statements. The valuation of goodwill and its impairment were subjected to {{an idea of the}} earnings management, where the management of the company subjectively decided the values to be realized, especially, the value of goodwill impairment that was criticized and questioned about its association with economic impairment indicators. However, this is in contrast with the purpose of IAS 36 on enhancing the fair presentation of the goodwill’s value, and the requirement that the company should consider and follow the economic impairment indicators while evaluating the goodwill impairments. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the association between the goodwill impairments, which were recorded by the listed telecommunication companies in Sweden (NASDAQ OMX Stockholm) during the year of 2005 to 2014, and the external and internal economic indicators. The Swedish listed telecommunication companies on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm were selected for this study with the reason that the companies in telecommunication industry have more possibilities to face with higher risk of impairment due to the high value of recorded goodwill. Moreover, the data was collected from information available on the company’s annual reports, and the discussion was based on the usages of tables and diagrams. Consequently, the results of this study have revealed that the values of goodwill impairments recorded by the selected companies did not associate with the external and internal economic indicators during this ten-year period. Additionally, this lack of association between these variables could also be explained by the ideas of <b>agency</b> theory and <b>earnings</b> management. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis studies two {{important}} asset pricing anomalies using a unified framework of return decomposition. Based on analyst earnings forecasts and residual income models, stock returns are decomposed into the expected return component, cash flow news and discount rate news. Chapter 1 tests the rational and behavioral explanations for price and earnings momentum. The results demonstrate that momentum profits {{do not come}} from the expected return component. Instead, momentum profits are mainly attributed to the large positive cash flow news and are partially offset by the negative discount rate news. The cash flow news is quite persistent before and after portfolio formation. The time-series dynamics in the discount rate news explain why the ex-ante expected return does not account for momentum returns. Compared with price momentum, earnings momentum does not sort by past discount rate news and does not display a long-term reversal. Overall, the empirical evidence based on return decomposition tends to support the behavioral explanation that the market incorporates cash flow information too slowly, which drives momentum returns. Chapter 2 studies the return predictability of accruals by exploring how fundamental information is incorporated into stock prices in the time series. Evidences show that the underperformance of high accruals stocks mainly comes from the underperformance in the cash flow news component with the effect being stronger for low accruals quality stocks. In addition, high discretionary accruals stocks experience lower total returns and cash flow news both before and after portfolio formation. No such pattern is observed for stock portfolios based on nondiscretionary accruals. At the aggregate level, innovations in aggregate accruals are negatively associated with contemporaneous returns through the discount rate news. Higher aggregate accruals predict higher future market returns due to both the expected return component and the discount rate news component. Overall, the results lend supports to the <b>earnings</b> fixation hypothesis, <b>agency</b> theory of <b>earnings</b> management, and Hirshleifer, Hou and Teoh's (2009) conjecture that aggregate accruals contain information about market discount rates...|$|R
