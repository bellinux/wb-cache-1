Based on dynamic fundamental solutions of a thin plate, governing boundary equations in the lateral and internal vibration of the thin plate are established by using a boundary element method (BEM). According to assembled conditions on the boundary, dynamic characteristics equations of the <b>assembled</b> thin <b>plates</b> structure are deduced. In order to raise calculating efficiency and avoid complicated programming operation, an approach of frequency scanning is introduced to analyze dynamic characteristics of the <b>assembled</b> thin <b>plates</b> structure. The natural frequencies and modal shapes are obtained fast and effectively. By numerical calculation and experiments given, the established method has not only good precision but also high efficiency...|$|R

Copper, typically used in windings of classic machines, limits current density allowed in field coils due to Joule effect losses. Also iron, {{which is used}} in magnetic circuits, limits the magnetic flux density obtained in the air gap due to saturation. The application of HTS field coils and iron removal effect in fractional power disk shaped or axial flux motors is analyzed by comparison of two different stator topologies. Twelve HTS field coils made of Bi- 2223 (Bi 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10) first generation tape, wrapped around a racetrack-shaped nylon core, are assembled. A simple topology was chosen, consisting of six filed coils per semi-stator arranged in the same plane with 60 º displacement.
