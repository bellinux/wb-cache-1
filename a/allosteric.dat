5|$|<b>Allosteric</b> {{sites are}} pockets on the enzyme, {{distinct}} from the active site, that bind to molecules in the cellular environment. These molecules then cause {{a change in the}} conformation or dynamics of the enzyme that is transduced to the active site and thus affects the reaction rate of the enzyme. In this way, <b>allosteric</b> interactions can either inhibit or activate enzymes. <b>Allosteric</b> interactions with metabolites upstream or downstream in an enzyme's metabolic pathway cause feedback regulation, altering the activity of the enzyme according to the flux {{through the rest of the}} pathway.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are also}} {{important}} in metabolic control. Many metabolic pathways in the cell are inhibited by metabolites that control enzyme activity through <b>allosteric</b> regulation or substrate inhibition. A good example is the <b>allosteric</b> regulation of the glycolytic pathway. This catabolic pathway consumes glucose and produces ATP, NADH and pyruvate. A key step for the regulation of glycolysis is an early reaction in the pathway catalysed by phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1). When ATP levels rise, ATP binds an <b>allosteric</b> site in PFK1 to decrease {{the rate of the}} enzyme reaction; glycolysis is inhibited and ATP production falls. This negative feedback control helps maintain a steady concentration of ATP in the cell. However, metabolic pathways are not just regulated through inhibition since enzyme activation is equally important. With respect to PFK1, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and ADP are examples of metabolites that are <b>allosteric</b> activators.|$|E
5|$|<b>Allosteric</b> enzymes include {{mammalian}} tyrosyl tRNA-synthetase, {{which shows}} negative cooperativity, and bacterial aspartate transcarbamoylase and phosphofructokinase, which show positive cooperativity.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{activity}} occurs along a protein's active site. Traditional drug design methods involve tightly binding to {{this site}} and blocking its activity, {{under the assumption}} that the target protein exists in one rigid structure. However, this approach works for approximately only 15% of all proteins. Proteins contain <b>allosteric</b> sites which, when bound to by small molecules, can alter a protein's conformation and ultimately affect the protein's activity. These sites are attractive drug targets, but locating them is very computationally costly. In 2012, Folding@home and MSMs were used to identify <b>allosteric</b> sites in three medically relevant proteins: beta-lactamase, interleukin-2, and RNase H.|$|E
5|$|While {{lanthanum}} has pharmacological {{effects on}} several receptors and ion channels, its specificity for the GABA receptor is unique among trivalent cations. Lanthanum acts {{at the same}} modulatory site on the GABA receptor as zinc, a known negative <b>allosteric</b> modulator. The lanthanum cation La3+ is a positive <b>allosteric</b> modulator at native and recombinant GABA receptors, increasing open channel time and decreasing desensitization in a subunit configuration dependent manner.|$|E
5|$|A mixed {{inhibitor}} binds to an <b>allosteric</b> {{site and}} the binding of the substrate and the inhibitor affect each other. The enzyme's function is reduced but not eliminated when bound to the inhibitor. This type of inhibitor does not follow the Michaelis-Menten equation.|$|E
5|$|In mixed inhibition, the {{inhibitor}} {{can bind to}} {{the enzyme}} {{at the same time}} as the enzyme's substrate. However, the binding of the inhibitor affects the binding of the substrate, and vice versa. This type of inhibition can be reduced, but not overcome by increasing concentrations of substrate. Although it is possible for mixed-type inhibitors to bind in the active site, this type of inhibition generally results from an <b>allosteric</b> effect where the inhibitor binds to a different site on an enzyme. Inhibitor binding to this <b>allosteric</b> site changes the conformation (i.e., tertiary structure or three-dimensional shape) of the enzyme so that the affinity of the substrate for the active site is reduced.|$|E
5|$|In some enzymes, no {{amino acids}} are {{directly}} involved in catalysis; instead, the enzyme contains sites to bind and orient catalytic cofactors. Enzyme structures may also contain <b>allosteric</b> sites where the binding of a small molecule causes a conformational change that increases or decreases activity.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines share {{a similar}} {{chemical}} structure, {{and their effects}} in humans are mainly produced by the <b>allosteric</b> modification of a specific kind of neurotransmitter receptor, the GABAA receptor, which increases the overall conductance of these inhibitory channels; this results in the various therapeutic effects as well as adverse effects of benzodiazepines. Other less important mechanisms of action are also known.|$|E
5|$|A {{competitive}} inhibitor and substrate cannot bind to {{the enzyme}} {{at the same}} time. Often competitive inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate of the enzyme. For example, the drug methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. The similarity between the structures of dihydrofolate and this drug are shown in the accompanying figure. This type of inhibition can be overcome with high substrate concentration. In some cases, the inhibitor can bind to a site other than the binding-site of the usual substrate and exert an <b>allosteric</b> effect to change {{the shape of the}} usual binding-site.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion is {{also known}} {{to act as a}} non-competitive {{antagonist}} of the α3β2, α3β4, α4β2, and, very weakly, α7 nACh receptors, and these actions appear to be importantly involved in its beneficial properties not only in smoking cessation, but in depression as well. The metabolites of bupropion also act as non-competitive antagonists of these nACh receptors, and hydroxybupropion is even more potent in comparison. At therapeutically-relevant concentrations bupropion and hydroxybupropion act as negative <b>allosteric</b> modulators of the serotonin 5-HT3A receptor. Pharmacological data on bupropion and its metabolites are shown in the table. Bupropion is known to weakly inhibit the α1 adrenergic receptor, with a 14% potency of its dopamine uptake inhibition, and the H1 receptor, with a 9% potency.|$|E
5|$|C-terminal truncation: The C-terminal end {{segment is}} the most conserved region of TnI. As an <b>allosteric</b> {{structure}} regulated by Ca2+ in the troponin complex, it binds and stabilizes the position of tropomyosin in low Ca2+ state implicating {{a role in the}} inhibition of actomyosin ATPase. A deletion of the C-terminal 19 amino acids was found during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in Langendorff perfused rat hearts. It was also seen in myocardial stunning in coronary bypass patients. Over-expression of the C-terminal truncated cardiac TnI (cTnI1-192) in transgenic mouse heart resulted in a phenotype of myocardial stunning with systolic and diastolic dysfunctions. Replacement of intact cTnI with cTnT1-192 in myofibrils and cardiomyocytes did not affect maximal tension development but decreased the rates of force redevelopment and relaxation.|$|E
5|$|The {{conformational}} {{mobility of}} serpins provides a key advantage over static lock-and-key protease inhibitors. In particular, {{the function of}} inhibitory serpins can be regulated by <b>allosteric</b> interactions with specific cofactors. The X-ray crystal structures of antithrombin, heparin cofactor II, MENT and murine antichymotrypsin reveal that these serpins adopt a conformation wherein the first two amino acids of the RCL are inserted {{into the top of}} the A β-sheet. The partially inserted conformation is important because co-factors are able to conformationally switch certain partially inserted serpins into a fully expelled form. This conformational rearrangement makes the serpin a more effective inhibitor.|$|E
5|$|There are {{multiple}} levels of metabolic regulation. In intrinsic regulation, the metabolic pathway self-regulates {{to respond to}} changes in the levels of substrates or products; for example, a decrease in the amount of product can increase the flux through the pathway to compensate. This type of regulation often involves <b>allosteric</b> regulation of the activities of multiple enzymes in the pathway. Extrinsic control involves a cell in a multicellular organism changing its metabolism in response to signals from other cells. These signals are usually in the form of soluble messengers such as hormones and growth factors and are detected by specific receptors on the cell surface. These signals are then transmitted inside the cell by second messenger systems that often involved the phosphorylation of proteins.|$|E
25|$|DHEA {{has been}} found to {{directly}} act on several neurotransmitter receptors, including acting as a positive <b>allosteric</b> modulator of the NMDA receptor, as a negative <b>allosteric</b> modulator of the GABAA receptor, and as an agonist of the σ1 receptor.|$|E
25|$|Class I RNR {{comprises}} RNR1 and RNR2 subunits, {{which can}} associate {{to form a}} heterodimeric tetramer. RNR1 contains both <b>allosteric</b> sites, mediating regulation of substrate specificity and activity. Depending on the <b>allosteric</b> configuration, {{one of the four}} ribonucleotides binds to the active site.|$|E
25|$|NADH, {{is another}} major <b>allosteric</b> {{inhibitor}} of GLUD1.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} an <b>allosteric</b> {{pharmacology}} for ion channels was developed over the years. In addition to the well known GABAA receptor positive <b>allosteric</b> modulators (such as benzodiazepines and barbiturate drugs), one can find antiparasitic drug such as ivermectin and glutamate receptor modulators used against Alzheimer's disease such as aniracetam.|$|E
25|$|Further {{research}} by the same group showed that (R)-citalopram also enhances binding of escitalopram, and therefore the <b>allosteric</b> interaction cannot explain the observed counteracting effect. In the most recent paper, however, the same authors again reversed their findings and reported that (R)-citalopram decreases binding of escitalopram to the transporter. Although <b>allosteric</b> binding of escitalopram to the serotonin transporter is of unquestionable research interest, its clinical relevance is unclear since the binding of escitalopram to the <b>allosteric</b> site is at least 1000 times weaker than to the primary binding site.|$|E
25|$|RNR {{may use the}} morpheein {{model of}} <b>allosteric</b> regulation.|$|E
25|$|The {{dopamine}} transporter is {{the target}} of substrates, dopamine releasers, transport inhibitors and <b>allosteric</b> modulators.|$|E
25|$|Another {{tool that}} generates full {{reaction}} networks from {{a set of}} rules is the <b>Allosteric</b> Network Compiler (ANC). Conceptually, ANC sees molecules as <b>allosteric</b> devices with a Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) type regulation mechanism, whose interactions are governed by their internal state, as well as by external modifications. A very useful feature of ANC is that it automatically computes dependent parameters, thereby imposing thermodynamic correctness.|$|E
25|$|If an <b>allosteric</b> protein binds to {{a target}} that {{also has a}} higher {{affinity}} for the R state, then target binding further stabilizes the R state, hence increasing ligand affinity. If, on the other hand, a target preferentially binds to the T state, then target binding will {{have a negative effect}} on ligand affinity. Such targets are called <b>allosteric</b> modulators.|$|E
25|$|Plain <b>allosteric</b> {{modulators}} do {{not belong}} to the opioids, instead they are classified as opioidergics.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone, via its active {{metabolite}} 3α-androstanediol, is {{a potent}} positive <b>allosteric</b> modulator of the GABAA receptor.|$|E
25|$|Regulation of RNR is {{designed}} to maintain balanced quantities of dNTPs. Binding of effector molecules either increases or decreases RNR activity. When ATP binds to the <b>allosteric</b> activity site, it activates RNR. In contrast, when dATP binds to this site, it deactivates RNR. In addition to controlling activity, the <b>allosteric</b> mechanism also regulates the substrate specificity and ensures the enzyme produces {{an equal amount of}} each dNTP for DNA synthesis. In all classes, binding of ATP or dATP to the <b>allosteric</b> site induces reduction of cytidine 5’-diphosphate (CDP) and uridine 5’-diphosphate (UDP); 2’-deoxyguanosine 5’-triphosphate (dGTP) induces reduction of adenosine 5’-diphosphate (ADP); and 2’-deoxythymidine 5’-triphosphate (dTTP) induces reduction of guanosine 5’-diphosphate (GDP) (Figure 1).|$|E
25|$|When GLUD1 {{is highly}} {{saturated}} with the active site ligands (substrates), an inhibitory abortive complex {{forms in the}} active site: NAD(P)H.Glu in the oxidative deamination reaction at high pH, and NAD(P)+.2-oxoglutarate in the reductive amination reaction at low pH. GLUD1 assumes its basal state configuration {{in the absence of}} <b>allosteric</b> effectors, regardless of whether the <b>allosteric</b> sites are functional. The <b>allosteric</b> regulators of GLUD1 - ADP, GTP, Leu, NAD+ and NADH - exert their effects by changing the energy required to open and close the catalytic cleft during enzymic turnover, in other words by destabilizing or stabilizing, respectively, the abortive complexes. Activators are not necessary for the catalytic function of GLUD1, as it is active in the absence of these compounds (basal state). It has been suggested that GLUD1 assumes in its basal state a configuration (open catalytic cleft) that permits catalytic activity regardless of whether the <b>allosteric</b> sites are functional. GLUD regulation is of particular biological importance as exemplified by observations showing that regulatory mutations of GLUD1 are associated with clinical manifestations in children.|$|E
25|$|Acetyl-CoA {{is formed}} into malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase, {{at which point}} malonyl-CoA is destined to feed into the fatty acid {{synthesis}} pathway. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase {{is the point of}} regulation in saturated straight-chain fatty acid synthesis, and is subject to both phosphorylation and <b>allosteric</b> regulation. Regulation by phosphorylation occurs mostly in mammals, while <b>allosteric</b> regulation occurs in most organisms. <b>Allosteric</b> control occurs as feedback inhibition by palmitoyl-CoA and activation by citrate. When there are high levels of palmitoyl-CoA, the final product of saturated fatty acid synthesis, it allosterically inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase to prevent a build-up of fatty acids in cells. Citrate acts to activate acetyl-CoA carboxylase under high levels, because high levels indicate that there is enough acetyl-CoA to feed into the Krebs cycle and produce energy.|$|E
25|$|THC, {{similarly}} to cannabidiol, albeit less potently, {{is a positive}} <b>allosteric</b> modulator of the μ- and δ-opioid receptors.|$|E
25|$|Computer {{simulations}} {{and molecular}} dynamics approaches revealed the atomistic motions {{associated with the}} molecular recognition of the histone tail through an <b>allosteric</b> mechanism.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its activity as a steroid hormone, progesterone is a neurosteroid. Specifically, it is an antagonist of the sigma σ1 receptor, a negative <b>allosteric</b> modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and, via its active metabolites allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, a potent positive <b>allosteric</b> modulator of the GABAA receptor. Through potentiation of the GABAA receptor, progesterone can produce sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, euphoric, cognitive-, memory-, and motor-impairing, anticonvulsant, and even anesthetic effects via formation of sufficiently high concentrations of its neurosteroid metabolites.|$|E
25|$|ATP {{competes with}} AMP for the <b>allosteric</b> {{effector}} {{site on the}} PFK enzyme. ATP concentrations in cells are much {{higher than those of}} AMP, typically 100-fold higher, but the concentration of ATP does not change more than about 10% under physiological conditions, whereas a 10% drop in ATP results in a 6-fold increase in AMP. Thus, the relevance of ATP as an <b>allosteric</b> effector is questionable. An increase in AMP is a consequence of a decrease in energy charge in the cell.|$|E
25|$|PDZ domain {{function}} {{can be both}} inhibited and {{activated by}} various mechanisms. Two of the most prevalent include <b>allosteric</b> interactions and posttraslational modifications.|$|E
25|$|Protein-protein {{interactions}} {{have been}} observed to alter the effectiveness of PDZ domains binding to ligands. These studies show that <b>allosteric</b> effects of certain proteins can affect the binding affinity for different substrates. Different PDZ domains can even have this <b>allosteric</b> effect on each other. This PDZ-PDZ interaction only acts as an inhibitor. Other experiments have shown that certain enzymes can enhance the binding of PDZ domains. Researchers found that the protein ezrin enhances the binding of the PDZ protein NHERF1.|$|E
25|$|In zymology, {{feedback}} {{serves as}} regulation of activity of an enzyme by its direct product(s) or downstream metabolite(s) in the metabolic pathway (see <b>Allosteric</b> regulation).|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} explain this phenomenon, {{researchers}} from Lundbeck proposed that escitalopram enhances its own binding via an additional interaction with another <b>allosteric</b> site on the transporter.|$|E
