5|$|No. 1 Squadron was re-formed as a {{heavy bomber}} unit on 23February 1948, when No.12 Squadron was re-designated. Operating Avro Lincolns, {{it was based}} at RAAF Station Amberley, Queensland, where it formed part of No.82 (Bomber) Wing. The wing's {{aircraft}} were serviced by No.482 (Maintenance) Squadron. From July 1950 to July 1958—for the first two-and-a-half years {{under the auspices of}} No.90 (Composite) Wing—it was based in Singapore, flying missions against communist guerrillas during the Malayan Emergency. Tasked by RAF Air Headquarters Malaya, the Lincolns generally conducted <b>area</b> <b>bombing</b> missions, as well as strikes against pinpoint targets. They operated singly and in formations, sometimes in concert with RAF bombers, and often strafed targets with their machine guns and 20mm cannon after dropping ordnance. The Lincolns were considered well suited to the campaign, owing to their range and ability to fly at low speeds to search for targets, as well as their firepower and heavy bomb load. Not having to contend with anti-aircraft fire, they flew mainly by day, but No.1 Squadron also operated by night, the only Commonwealth unit to do so.|$|E
5|$|Four of XXIBomber Command's {{next five}} raids were made against targets in Nagoya. The first {{two of these}} attacks on 13 and 18December used {{precision}} bombing tactics, and damaged the city's aircraft plants. The third raid was a daylight incendiary attack which was conducted after the Twentieth Air Force directed that 100 B-29s armed with M-69 bombs be dispatched against Nagoya to test {{the effectiveness of these}} weapons on a Japanese city. Hansell protested this order, as he believed that precision attacks were starting to produce results and moving to area bombardment would be counterproductive, but agreed to the operation after he was assured that it did not represent a general shift in tactics. Despite the change in armament, the 22December raid was planned as a precision attack on an aircraft factory using only 78 bombers, and bad weather meant that little damage was caused. XXIBomber Command raided the Musashino aircraft plant in Tokyo again on 27December, but did not damage the facility. On 3January 1945, 97 B-29s were dispatched to conduct an <b>area</b> <b>bombing</b> raid on Nagoya. This attack started several fires, but these were quickly brought under control.|$|E
5|$|Headlam became Officer Commanding North-Western Area in January 1946. Posted to Britain {{at the end}} of the year, he {{attended}} the Royal Air Force Staff College, Andover, and served with RAAF Overseas Headquarters, London. On his return to Australia, in November 1947, he became Director of Training at RAAF Headquarters. In November 1950, Headlam was appointed to take over command of No.90 (Composite) Wing from Group Captain Paddy Heffernan. Headquartered at RAF Changi, Singapore, No.90 Wing controlled RAAF units operating during the Malayan Emergency: No.1 (Bomber) Squadron, flying Avro Lincolns, and No.38 (Transport) Squadron, flying Douglas C-47 Dakotas. The Lincolns conducted <b>area</b> <b>bombing</b> missions over communist-held territory, as well as strikes against pinpoint targets. The Dakotas were tasked with courier flights, VIP transport and medical evacuations across South East Asia, and in Malaya with airlifting troops and cargo, dropping supplies to friendly forces and despatching propaganda leaflets. Headlam was slightly injured on 20December, when a No.38 Squadron Dakota he was co-piloting on a supply drop crash-landed at Kampong Aur in Pahang, following engine failure. In August 1951 he was named commander of RAF Tengah, Singapore, in addition to his post as commanding officer of No.90 Wing. Headlam handed over command of No.90 Wing in December 1951.|$|E

5|$|The Lincolns {{generally}} conducted <b>area</b> <b>bombing</b> missions, {{as well as}} {{strikes against}} pinpoint targets. They operated singly and in formations, sometimes in concert with RAF bombers. Not having to contend with anti-aircraft fire, the Lincolns flew mainly by day. After completing a bomb run, they would make another pass over the target to strafe with machine guns and 20mm cannon. The Lincolns were considered well suited to the campaign, owing to their range and ability to fly at low speeds to search for targets, {{as well as their}} firepower and heavy bomb load. No.1 Squadron also flew night missions—the only Commonwealth air force unit authorised to do so—of up to six hours duration, dropping one bomb every half hour or so. To reduce the risk of collateral damage, all air strikes had to be approved by the Joint Operation Centre, located at Kuala Lumpur in central Malaya and staffed by military, police and civilian personnel. Although the original purpose of the bombing campaign was to kill as many insurgents as possible, the impracticality of achieving this in operations over dense jungle resulted in a shift towards harassing and demoralising the communists, driving them out of their bases and into areas held by Commonwealth ground troops.|$|E
5|$|No.1 Squadron re-equipped with Canberra Mk.20s after {{returning}} to Australia. The RAAF's first jet bomber, the Canberra was subsonic but had long range and was highly manoeuvrable. It had been procured partly for its capacity to deliver nuclear weapons, an ordnance option the government seriously contemplated but never acquired. Initially the Canberra's envisaged mission profile was medium-to-high-altitude <b>area</b> <b>bombing</b> but its primitive bombsight and light load made this a dubious proposition, and by mid-1961 crews were training in low-level army cooperation tactics. No.1 Squadron was awarded successive Gloucester Cups for its proficiency in 1959–60 and 1960–61. As of January 1962, its strength was eight aircraft and 53 personnel, including 18 officers. The unit effectively ceased operations in 1968, to begin converting to the General Dynamics F-111C supersonic bomber, which was expected to enter service soon afterwards. Already controversial owing to its escalating cost, the F-111 program was heavily delayed by airworthiness concerns related to its swing-wing technology. In September 1970, as an interim measure while awaiting delivery of the F-111, No.1 Squadron relinquished its Canberras for leased McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantoms, which it operated until June 1973. Although the Phantom had a multi-role capability, the RAAF employed it as a strike aircraft to maintain compatibility with the proposed F-111 mission profile. One of No.1 Squadron's Phantoms was lost with its crew of two in June 1971, the only fatalities and hull loss of the 24 aircraft leased to the RAAF. Though not as sophisticated an aircraft as the F-111, the Phantom was a significant advance over the Canberra, and well regarded by its Australian crews.|$|E

25|$|In 1942, Professor Frederick Lindemann (later ennobled as Lord Cherwell), {{having been}} {{appointed}} the British government's leading scientific adviser (with {{a seat in}} the Cabinet) by his friend, Prime Minister Winston Churchill, presented a seminal paper to Cabinet advocating the <b>area</b> <b>bombing</b> of German cities in a strategic bombing campaign.

The American inquiry established that the Soviets, pursuant to allied agreements for the United States and the United Kingdom to provide air support for the Soviet offensive toward Berlin, had requested <b>area</b> <b>bombing</b> of Dresden to prevent a counterattack through Dresden, or the use of Dresden as a regrouping point after a strategic retreat.|$|E

25|$|Harris's {{continued}} {{preference for}} <b>area</b> <b>bombing</b> over precision targeting remains controversial, partly because many senior Allied air commanders thought it less effective and partly {{for the large}} number of civilian casualties and destruction this strategy caused in Continental Europe.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, new bombers with longer ranges were coming into service, {{particularly}} the Avro Lancaster, which became available {{in large numbers}} during 1942. During most of 1942, however, Bomber Command's priority was attacking Germany's U-boat ports as part of Britain's effort to win the Battle of the Atlantic. During the whole of 1942 there were only nine air alerts in Berlin, none of them serious. Only in 1943 did Harris have both the means {{and the opportunity to}} put his belief in <b>area</b> <b>bombing</b> into practice.|$|E
25|$|The American agenda, sent up in June 1943 {{planned a}} {{strike at the}} German air industry, which was {{considered}} a prerequisite to any aerial and or land offensives on the continent. Its aim was to defeat the Luftwaffe in the air, {{on the ground and}} to destroy its aviation industry to a degree that it could no longer pose a threat to an Allied invasion of the continent. General Ira C. Eaker had proposed a combined offensive for this operation, named Operation Pointblank. Its plan was based upon selection, or precision attack by USAAF forces in daylight, supported by the <b>area</b> <b>bombing</b> methods of Bomber Command at night. Harris, however, was reluctant to divert forces for precision attacks, as Bomber Command had not been trained in precision bombing, nor would the equipment in the bombers allow for a precision ability until 1944. In theory, the British bomber attack assumed a precision ability, but nothing had been done to ensure such practice. Instead, Harris favoured <b>area</b> <b>bombing</b> against industrial cities. Bomber Command's success during the Battle of the Ruhr and the Battle of Hamburg, and the failures of the USAAF to make an impact in 1943 also seemed to vindicate Harris' policy. Heavy losses among unescorted bombers for little return would ensure a suspension of deep penetration raids in October 1943. It was not until the introduction of a long-range fighter that could escort bombers deep into Germany and back, that a daylight strategy became possible.|$|E

25|$|The {{entry of}} America {{into the war}} in December 1941 did not {{initially}} change much. However, what did alter matters was the appointment of Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris as Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Bomber Command in early 1942. Harris was a zealous advocate of the <b>area</b> <b>bombing</b> of German cities. He put a new fire and drive into the operations of Bomber Command. During the summer of 1942, the first 1,000 bomber raids were launched on German cities. However, at that time, such large numbers of aircraft could only be put over the target by stripping training units of their aircraft temporarily.|$|E
25|$|In early 1944, Portal's view of {{strategic}} bombing changed; {{he felt that}} bombers could also play a more auxiliary role in the allied offensive. (Much {{of what is known}} about Portal's thinking is based on memoranda he wrote.) He argued for the new approach {{on the basis of the}} huge increase in the size of the bomber force, which would carry out not just precision bombing but also indiscriminate <b>area</b> <b>bombing</b> by night of all German cities with populations exceeding 100,000. Portal thought that the resulting damage to the German war effort and civilian morale would lead to victory within six months. A second memorandum in 1945 made a similar argument.|$|E
25|$|Appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1939 New Year Honours, Portal became Air Member for Personnel on the Air Council on 1 February 1939.

Portal advocated strategic <b>area</b> <b>bombing</b> against German industrial areas, {{the same sort of}} targets that the Luftwaffe was already targeting in the United Kingdom. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1940 Birthday Honours.|$|E

25|$|Portal {{accompanied}} Churchill to all {{the great}} conferences and made a good impression on Americans. In January 1943, at the Casablanca Conference, the Combined Chiefs of Staff selected him to coordinate the bomber forces of both the United States and Britain in a combined bomber offensive over Germany. The forces were transferred to U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower {{for the duration of}} Operation Overlord; but when their control reverted to the Combined Chiefs, Portal still advocated <b>area</b> <b>bombing</b> of German cities instead of specific targets, such as Axis oil production facilities. He was promoted to Marshal of the Royal Air Force on 1 January 1944.|$|E
25|$|Spaatz and Harris {{once again}} protested at {{the use of}} their {{services}} for tactical support, each with their own agendas and targets. Harris wanted to continue his policy of <b>area</b> <b>bombing</b> industrial cities, Spaatz wanted to attack the oil plants. Both believed their strategies would cripple the German war effort. Spaatz threatened to resign if {{at least one of the}} strategic bomber forces was not given over to a campaign against oil targets. He argued bombing tactical targets in France was pointless, as rail yards could be easily repaired. Moreover, he wanted to provoke the Luftwaffe in battle. Spaatz thought that attacking rail targets would not achieve this, but striking at Petroleum would. Eisenhower relented, and Spaatz succeeded in moving the USAAF 15AF to Romanian targets. Up until this point, only sporadic attacks had been made against oil targets.|$|E
25|$|Immediate German {{propaganda}} claims {{following the}} attacks and post-war discussions {{on whether the}} attacks were justified {{has led to the}} bombing becoming one of the moral causes célèbres of the war. A 1953 United States Air Force report defended the operation as the justified bombing of a strategic target, which they noted was a major rail transport and communication centre, housing 110 factories and 50,000 workers in support of the German war effort. Several researchers have asserted that not all of the communications infrastructure, such as the bridges, were targeted, nor were the extensive industrial areas outside the city centre. Critics of the bombing have claimed that Dresden was a cultural landmark of little or no strategic significance, and that the attacks were indiscriminate <b>area</b> <b>bombing</b> and not proportionate to the military gains. The bombing has been referred to by some in the German far-right as a war crime.|$|E
