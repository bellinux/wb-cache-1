25|$|Fraser {{recorded}} {{the development of}} a single white spruce tree from 1926 to 1961. Apical growth of the stem was slow from 1926 through 1936 when the tree was competing with herbs and shrubs and probably shaded by larger trees. Lateral branches began to show reduced growth and some were no longer in evidence on the 36-year-old tree. Apical growth totalling about 340 m, 370 m, 420 m, 450 m, 500 m, 600 m, and 600 m was made by the tree in the years 1955 through 1961, respectively. The total number of needles of all ages present on the 36-year-old tree in 1961 was 5.25 million weighing 14.25kg. In 1961, needles as old as 13 years remained on the tree.The ash weight of needles increased progressively with age from about 4% in first-year needles in 1961 to about 8% in needles 10 years old. In discussing the data obtained from the one 11 m tall white spruce, Fraser et al. (1964) speculated that if the photosynthate used in making apical growth in 1961 was manufactured the previous year, then the 4 million needles that were produced up to 1960 manufactured food for about 600,000mm of apical growth or 730 g dry weight, over 12 million mm3 of wood for the 1961 <b>annual</b> <b>ring,</b> plus 1 million new needles, in addition to new tissue in branches, bark, and roots in 1960. Added to this would be the photosynthate to produce energy to sustain respiration over this period, an mount estimated to be about 10% of the total annual photosynthate production of a young healthy tree. On this basis, one needle produced food for about 0.19mg dry weight of apical growth, 3mm3 wood, one-quarter of a new needle, plus an unknown amount of branch wood, bark and roots.|$|E

2500|$|... "When {{the rings}} are wide, the {{transition}} from spring wood to summer wood is gradual, while in the narrow rings the spring wood passes into summer wood abruptly. The width of the spring wood changes but little with {{the width of the}} <b>annual</b> <b>ring,</b> so that the narrowing or broadening of the <b>annual</b> <b>ring</b> is always {{at the expense of the}} summer wood. The narrow vessels of the summer wood make it richer in wood substance than the spring wood composed of wide vessels. Therefore, rapid-growing specimens with wide rings have more wood substance than slow-growing trees with narrow rings. Since the more the wood substance the greater the weight, and the greater the weight the stronger the wood, chestnuts with wide rings must have stronger wood than chestnuts with narrow rings. This agrees with the accepted view that sprouts (which always have wide rings) yield better and stronger wood than seedling chestnuts, which grow more slowly in diameter." ...|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{variation}} in average wood density of <b>annual</b> <b>rings,</b> earlywood density, and latewood density in addition to ring width and latewood percentage within Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stems from the pith to the bark, and from the stem base towards the stem apex. Moreover, {{the variation in}} wood density within <b>annual</b> <b>rings</b> was studied at the different heights and radial positions in the stem. The material consisted of 85 trees from central and south-eastern Finland. Variation between the <b>annual</b> <b>rings</b> accounted for 11 – 27 % of the total variation in wood density. Only small differences (3 – 6 %) in wood density were found between different heights in the stem. The largest (49 – 80 %) variation in wood density was found within the <b>annual</b> <b>rings.</b> The difference in wood density between earlywood and latewood was smaller in the rings near the pith than in the outer rings. The increasing wood density from the pith outwards was related to increasing latewood density and latewood per-centage, whereas the earlywood density increased only slightly from the pith outwards. In a given cambial age (i. e., given rings from the pith), the average wood density of <b>annual</b> <b>rings</b> increased with increasing stem height. In contrast, in the rings formed in the same calendar years (i. e., given rings from the bark), the average wood density of <b>annual</b> <b>rings</b> decreased with increasing stem height.

40|$|The PrimWood method. Part 1 : Properties and {{production}} of timber with vertical <b>annual</b> <b>rings.</b> Old traditions and modern measurements show that radial sawn wood is subject to smaller moisture movements in {{the plane of the}} surface and has a harder surface and better shape-stability than timber sawn by conventional sawing techniques such as square sawing and through-and-through sawing. The advantages are greater if the juvenile wood is removed. Timber with radial faces and where the juvenile wood has been removed is said to have vertical <b>annual</b> <b>rings,</b> and such timber is particularly valuable for products such as floors, furniture, panels and exterior carpentry. The special properties of the timber are then utilised in the best possible manner. The PrimWood method is a new production concept for the manufacture of high quality wood components and boards of massive wood from both softwood and hardwood. The concept leads to a knot-free material with vertical <b>annual</b> <b>rings.</b> Upprättat; 2007; 20140902 (dicsan...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{formation}} of <b>annual</b> growth <b>rings</b> {{has been confirmed}} for several mangrove species in the last decade, among which is the Rhizophora mangle. However, the record of <b>annual</b> <b>rings</b> for this species was made in a region with high hydric seasonality, a widely recognized induction factor of <b>annual</b> <b>rings</b> in tropical species. In this sense, the present study aimed to verify the occurrence of <b>annual</b> growth <b>rings</b> in R. mangle in the mangroves of Guaratiba (Rio de Janeiro, Southeastern Brazil), a region with low hydric seasonality. For this purpose, the crossdating technique was applied in ten trees collected with known age (seven years). The growth rings are characterized by alternating layers of low vessel density (earlywood) and high vessel density (latewood). Multiple regression analysis indicated that growth rings width variation is driven by precipitation, water surplus, water deficit and water storage. Crossdating analysis confirmed the existence of <b>annual</b> growth <b>rings</b> in the R. mangle in Guaratiba. This discovery in a region with low hydric seasonality increases the dendrocronological potential of this species and suggests the importance of biological factors (eg. phenological behavior) as complementary inductors for the {{formation of}} growth rings in this species...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} of using <b>annual</b> <b>rings</b> of Pinus sylvestris L. to assess chemical {{pollution in the}} Republic of Karelia is discussed. With the help of principal component factor analysis {{the relationship between the}} contents of chemical elements and dendrological parameters – the width of <b>annual</b> <b>rings</b> and wood density - was revealed. The main factors contributing to the pollution of {{the northern part of the}} Republic of Karelia by the emission from iron-ore enterprise JSC «Karelsky Okatysh» are frequent ecologically significant wind directions, the distance from the source and the total mass of the emission. The value of radial growth (the average width of <b>annual</b> <b>rings</b> for five-years) of Pinus sylvestris L. is connected negatively with the content of Cu, Cd, Ni and Fe. As an element of nutrition, Mn is positively correlated with the density of wood wherein it is an antagonist of Fe and partially of Cr in northern areas. Several peaks of Pb content coincide with the most intense tests of atomic weapons. Sharp maximums of Pb can also be due to a cross-border pollution and emission from regional sources...|$|R
30|$|On {{the basis}} of their report, {{increases}} in the density of the air-dried wood specimens with the distance from the pith, as shown in Fig.  3, would be mainly due to the changes in the structures of <b>annual</b> <b>rings,</b> such as an increase in the latewood percentage and in the density of latewood. The differences in the densities of wood specimens with the same ARW, as shown in Fig.  4, may be attributed to the difference in the structures of the <b>annual</b> <b>rings.</b> In addition, the presence of extractives such as arabinogalactan may also affect the wood density in the air-dried condition [12, 13].|$|R
