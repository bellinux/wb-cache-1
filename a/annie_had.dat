5|$|Sledd and {{his wife}} <b>Annie</b> <b>had</b> nine {{children}}. Eight of their children graduated from Emory, seven with Phi Beta Kappa honors, a fact newsworthy enough {{to be picked up}} by the Associated Press wire service when youngest daughter Antoinette graduated from Emory the year following Sledd's death. Two of their sons followed in their father's footsteps, earning doctorates and becoming university professors: James H. Sledd became a Rhodes Scholar and noted professor of English literature at the University of Chicago and the University of Texas; Marvin B. Sledd was a professor of mathematics at Georgia Tech.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} 1987–1988 season, Rodman steadily improved his stats, averaging 11.6points and 8.7rebounds and starting in 32 of 82 regular season games. The Pistons fought {{their way into}} the 1988 NBA Finals, and took a 3–2 lead, but lost in seven games against the Los Angeles Lakers. In Game Six, the Pistons were down by one point with eight seconds to go; Dumars missed a shot, and Rodman just fell short of an offensive rebound and a putback which could have won the title. In Game Seven, L.A. led by 15points in the fourth quarter, but Rodman's defense helped cut down the lead to six with 3:52minutes to go and to two with one minute to go. But then, he fouled Magic Johnson, who hit a free throw, missed an ill-advised shot with 39seconds to go, and the Pistons never recovered. In that year, he and his girlfriend <b>Annie</b> <b>had</b> a daughter they named Alexis.|$|E
25|$|Intent (and hell-bent) {{on making}} Annie's life miserable and relishing the {{opportunity}} to abuse her once again, {{in spite of her}} husband's vehement objections towards it; she blatantly shows her favoritism towards Selby by giving him Annie's old room (demanding viciously that the room be fumigated beforehand) and spiriting the girl to some room in the rear part of the house. While Annie wasn't too upset about being moved, accepting the situation cheerfully as she usually seems to do, Susanne, the maid, was angered that <b>Annie</b> <b>had</b> been moved.|$|E

25|$|Joe Watt {{returned}} to Fraserburgh {{after the war}} and refused point blank to ever speak of his war experience again, even to his wife. His boat <b>Annie</b> <b>had</b> been lost in the war to a sea mine, and so he bought Benachie as a replacement, on board which he once forgot to remove his cap on meeting the Duke of Kent, an omission which mortified him for years afterwards. He served on several other fishing vessels over the next twenty years before joining the Navy again as a drifter captain to serve in the Second World War, which he spent on uneventful duties in home waters accompanied by his son who had been wounded in the Battle of France serving with the Gordon Highlanders and invalided out of the army. He was on occasion heard to complain that he had been refused foreign service due to his age, which he seemed to feel should be an advantage rather than a hindrance.|$|E
500|$|The {{book also}} drew {{inspiration}} from pulp science fiction, religious literature and television clichés. [...] Harold Gray's comic strip Little Orphan <b>Annie</b> <b>had</b> an effect on Brown after he discovered some Annie reprint books in the early 1980s. [...] This {{was to be a}} primary influence on later work of Brown's such as Louis Riel.|$|E
500|$|... 679 {{released}} the album {{in the rest}} of Europe during early 2005 but was unsure how to categorise and market Anniemal. It asked Annie about artists like Goldfrapp whose audiences 679 thought it should target. Uncertain that the album's Internet hype would significantly bolster the album's sales, the label did not heavily promote it. In support of the album, Annie opened for English alternative dance band Saint Etienne at several June 2005 gigs in the United Kingdom. <b>Annie</b> <b>had</b> never performed her songs live before the release of Anniemal, so replicating the sound of more electronic songs like [...] "Chewing Gum" [...] became a long process. By September of that year, the album had sold 20,000 copies.|$|E

500|$|Lofton {{was raised}} by his widowed grandmother, Rosie Persons, in [...] "the slums" [...] of East Chicago, Indiana. His mother, <b>Annie,</b> <b>had</b> Lofton {{while she was in}} high school and he weighed just three pounds (1.4kg) at birth. His mother moved to Alabama after she {{graduated}} and lost contact with Lofton. Of his father, Lofton said, [...] "We, as a family, don't even talk about it." [...] Persons had glaucoma and because of her failing eyesight was unemployed. She refused to go on welfare but did collect Social Security as a result from her husband's death in 1960 (of bronchial pneumonia). When Lofton made the majors he built a new home in East Chicago for his grandmother and other family members.|$|E
500|$|George and <b>Annie</b> <b>had</b> five daughters: Mary Elizabeth, {{known as}} 'Mimi' (1906 to 1991), born on 24 April 1906, {{several months before}} her parents married; Elizabeth Jane 'Mater' (1908 to 1976); Annie Georgina 'Nanny' (1911–1988); Julia 'Judy' (1914–1958); and Harriet 'Harrie' (1916–1972). After {{the birth of his}} daughters, Stanley stopped going to sea and got a job with the Liverpool and Glasgow Tug Salvage Company as an {{insurance}} investigator. He moved his family to the Liverpool suburb of Allerton, where they lived in a small terraced house at 9 Newcastle Road. [...] According to Beatles biographer Bob Spitz, Mimi assumed a matriarchal role in the Stanley house to help her mother, and dressed [...] "as if {{she was on her way}} to a weekly garden club meeting". Friends of Lennon later stated that his aunt based everything on decorum, honesty, and a black-and-white attitude: [...] "Either you were good enough or you were not." [...] Lennon's school friend, Pete Shotton, later commented that she [...] "had a very strong sense of what was right or wrong". [...] Annie Stanley died in 1941, so Mimi accepted the responsibility of caring for her father, with help from her younger sister, Julia.|$|E
2500|$|According to biographer Glenda Riley, [...] "the wolves" [...] {{could have}} been the Studabaker family. However, the 1870 U.S. Census {{suggests}} that [...] "the wolves" [...] were the Abram Boose family of neighboring Preble County. Around the spring of 1872, Annie ran away from [...] "the wolves". According to biographer Shirl Kasper, it was only at this point that <b>Annie</b> <b>had</b> met and lived with the Edingtons, returning to her mother's home around the age of 15. Annie's mother married a third time, to Joseph Shaw, on October 25, 1874.|$|E

2500|$|On March 1, 1871, Judson and Holden, with Dollie, Nellie, {{and their}} sons Bonta and George (now 17 and 12, respectively), {{moved to the}} Nooksack Valley. Judson's {{daughter}} <b>Annie</b> <b>had</b> married Eason Ebey (son of the beheaded Isaac Ebey), and her second daughter Mary stayed on Whidbey Island in order to attend school for another six months. When Judson returned to the island in September 1871 to retrieve Mary, Eason Ebey read her the poem [...] (by Thomas Campbell). This poem would later be {{the inspiration for the}} name [...] "Lynden".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} June 1850 {{his bright}} nine-year-old {{daughter}} Annie who had become a particular favourite and comfort to him fell sick and, after a painful illness, died on 23 April 1851. During Annie's long illness Darwin had read books by Francis William Newman, a Unitarian evolutionist who called for a new post-Christian synthesis and wrote that [...] "the fretfulness of a child is an infinite evil". Darwin wrote at the time, [...] "Our only consolation is that she passed a short, though joyous life." [...] For three years he had deliberated about the Christian meaning of mortality. This opened a new vision of tragically circumstantial nature. His faith in Christianity had already dwindled away and he had stopped going to church. He wrote out his memories of Annie, but no longer believed in an afterlife or in salvation. Emma believed that <b>Annie</b> <b>had</b> gone to heaven and told this to the children, with the unfortunate result that Henrietta wondered, if all the angels were men, did women go to heaven?, and worried for months that her naughtiness while Annie was alive would mean that {{she would go to}} hell unless God forgave her.|$|E
2500|$|William and <b>Annie</b> <b>had</b> a daughter, Marion duPont, {{and a son}} William duPont, Jr. Upon William duPont, Sr.'s {{death in}} 1928, William duPont, Jr. {{inherited}} the family's Bellevue estate in Delaware, whereupon he had the estate's mansion converted into a replica of Montpelier (now preserved as a state park), and Marion inherited the Montpelier estate. Marion preserved much of {{the core of the}} Madison home, gardens, and grounds as a legacy for all Americans. After her father's death, Marion made only one change to the house; she remodeled her parents' music room in the latest Art Deco style, using modern and innovative materials such as laminated plywood, chrome, glass block, and plate glass mirrors. [...] A weather vane was installed on the ceiling, which allowed wind direction to direct the hounds for fox hunting. [...] An exact replica of the Art Deco room {{can be seen in the}} DuPont Gallery, in the Visitors' Center at Montpelier. [...] Prior to her parents moving into the property, they enlarged the house considerably, adding wings that more than doubled the number of rooms to 55. Her parents also had the brick covered with a stucco exterior for a lighter look.|$|E
