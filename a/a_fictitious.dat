5|$|In general relativity, gravity becomes <b>a</b> <b>fictitious</b> {{force that}} arises in {{situations}} where spacetime deviates from a flat geometry. As an extension, Kaluza–Klein theory and string theory ascribe electromagnetism and the other fundamental forces respectively to the curvature of differently scaled dimensions, which would ultimately imply that all forces are fictitious.|$|E

5|$|The day before, the Ottoman {{government}} had proposed to Wangenheim that <b>a</b> <b>fictitious</b> {{purchase of the}} German ships be arranged, so their presence would not compromise Ottoman neutrality. The next day the German Chancellor had cabled Wagenheim, rejecting the idea and demanding that the Ottomans immediately join the war. The Grand Vizier accosted Wagenheim on the premature arrival of the ships and repeated the demand for <b>a</b> <b>fictitious</b> sale. The Ottoman government subsequently declared that it had purchased both ships for 80 million German marks. On 14 August, Wagenheim advised the German government {{that it would be}} best to go along with the sale, lest they risk angering the Ottomans.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the development of}} the DXDR method by introducing <b>a</b> modified <b>fictitious</b> time (MFT) increment. The MFT is determined by minimizing the residual force after each iteration. The rank of the convergence rate shows the advantage of the new method. The results obtained from plate and truss analyses demonstrate the potential of the new method. It is shown that, compared with <b>a</b> unit <b>fictitious</b> time, the MFT is more efficient, especially during the initial iterations. Moreover, MFT does not impose any additional constraints on the DXDR method...|$|R

5|$|In 2005, Colbert left The Daily Show {{to host a}} {{spin-off}} series entitled The Colbert Report, {{a parody}} of personality-driven political pundit programs such as Fox News's The O'Reilly Factor that center largely on the personal views of their hosts.

5|$|In Europe, {{where much}} of the vampire {{folklore}} originates, the vampire is usually considered <b>a</b> <b>fictitious</b> being; many communities may have embraced the revenant for economic purposes. In some cases, especially in small localities, vampire superstition is still rampant and sightings or claims of vampire attacks occur frequently. In Romania during February 2004, several relatives of Toma Petre feared that he had become a vampire. They dug up his corpse, tore out his heart, burned it, and mixed the ashes with water in order to drink it.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, {{the vampire}} is {{generally}} {{held to be}} <b>a</b> <b>fictitious</b> entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures such as the chupacabra still persists in some cultures. Early folk belief in vampires has sometimes been ascribed to the ignorance of the body's process of decomposition after death and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalise this, creating {{the figure of the}} vampire to explain the mysteries of death. Porphyria was also linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure, but has since been largely discredited.|$|E
