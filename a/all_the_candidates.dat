5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Bradley moved to Louisville and resumed his legal practice. Shortly after Bradley left office, Goebel and his running mate, J. C. W. Beckham, {{challenged}} {{the results of}} the 1899 election in the General Assembly, per the state constitution. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> for the state's minor offices contested as well. Bradley and his colleague Augustus Willson formed part of the legal team that represented the Republicans before the General Assembly and in court, where they challenged the legality of the Goebel Election Law and, later, the actions of the General Assembly's contest committee.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Tydings–Butler race, McCarthy campaigned for several other Republicans in the 1950 elections, including Everett Dirksen against Democratic incumbent and Senate Majority Leader Scott W. Lucas. Dirksen, and indeed <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> McCarthy supported, won their elections, and those he opposed lost. The elections, including many that McCarthy was not involved in, were an overall Republican sweep. Although his impact on the elections was unclear, McCarthy was credited as a key Republican campaigner. He was now {{regarded as one of}} the most powerful men in the Senate and was treated with new-found deference by his colleagues.|$|E
5|$|<b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> in a GRC {{must either}} {{be members of}} the same {{political}} party or independent candidates standing as a group, and {{at least one of the}} candidates must be a person belonging to the Malay, Indian or some other minority community. A person is regarded as belonging to the Malay community if, regardless of whether or not he or she is of the Malay race, considers himself or herself to be a member of the community and is generally accepted as such by the community. Similarly, a person will belong to the Indian community or some other minority community if he or she considers himself or herself a member and the community accepts him or her as such. The minority status of candidates is determined by two committees appointed by the President, the Malay Community Committee and the Indian and Other Minority Communities Committee. Decisions of these committees are final and conclusive, and may not be appealed against or called into question in any court.|$|E

5|$|At his 1st dan judo examination, Abbe {{had caught}} the {{attention}} of Shotaro Tobata from the Butoku Kai, who had been refereeing at the event. Tobata had suggested to Nakamoto and Abbe that the young man should apply for entry to the renowned Budo Senmon Gakko (abbreviated to 'Busen,' and sometimes referred to as 'Busen College'), a specialist college for martial artists. With the additional help of a teacher named Nakano, Abbe now prepared for the entrance examination in Kyoto. Out of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>candidates,</b> of which there were around 300 that year, 20 would be accepted into the judo programme and 20 into the kendo programme. Abbe performed well and was accepted into both programmes.|$|E

He took the civil service exam a second time during the following year, but <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> were failed by the prime minister (apparently in order to prevent the emergence of possible rivals). He never again attempted the examinations, instead petitioning the emperor directly in 751, 754 and probably again in 755. He married around 752, and by 757 the couple had had five children—three sons and two daughters—but one of the sons died in infancy in 755. From 754 he began to have lung problems (probably asthma), {{the first of a series}} of ailments which dogged him for the rest of his life. It was in that year that Du Fu was forced to move his family due to the turmoil of a famine brought about by massive floods in the region.|$|E
5|$|Nasser's {{nomination}} {{for the post}} and the new constitution were put to public referendum on 23 June and each was approved by an overwhelming majority. A 350-member National Assembly was established, elections for which were held in July 1957. Nasser had ultimate approval over <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>candidates.</b> The constitution granted women's suffrage, prohibited gender-based discrimination, and entailed special protection {{for women in the}} workplace. Coinciding with the new constitution and Nasser's presidency, the RCC dissolved itself and its members resigned their military commissions as part of the transition to civilian rule. During the deliberations surrounding the establishment of a new government, Nasser began a process of sidelining his rivals among the original Free Officers, while elevating his closest allies to high-ranking positions in the cabinet.|$|E
30|$|Certainly, this hybrid cognitive-cooperative {{communication}} {{architecture is}} facing both technical and practical challenges. For instances, the relays should get sufficient incentives {{for participating in}} the cooperative communications. In addition, if there are multiple candidate relays, it may be impossible/impractical for the primary user to collect information from <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> relays {{to make a decision}} of relay selection. The reason is twofold: (i) The time for collecting information from <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> relays may exceed the PU’s end-to-end delay tolerance, and (ii) <b>the</b> availability of <b>candidate</b> relays may change during the collecting time as CR links are generally not stable. Therefore, an idea cognitive-cooperative scheme should be able to well incentivize the CR users and select a proper relay in a given time.|$|R

25|$|A disinterested voter who {{has formed}} no {{personal}} preference may simply number <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> sequentially, 1, 2, 3, etc., {{from top to}} bottom of the ballot paper, a practice termed donkey voting, which advantages those candidates whose names are placed nearest {{to the top of the}} ballot paper. Before 1984, candidates were listed in alphabetical order, which led to a profusion of Aaronses and Abbotts contesting elections. A notable example was the 1937 Senate election, in which the Labor candidate group in New South Wales consisted of Amour, Ashley, Armstrong and Arthur—all of whom were elected. Since 1984, the listed order of candidates on the ballot paper has been determined by drawing lots, a ceremony performed publicly by electoral officials immediately after the appointed time for closure of nominations.|$|E

25|$|Eventually the Congress {{was able}} {{to draw up a}} shortlist.

Louis-Philippe realized that the choice of either of the Bonapartists could be first stage of a coup against him, but that his son would also be unacceptable to other European powers suspicious of French intentions. Nemours refused the offer. With no definitive choice in sight, Catholics and Liberals united to elect Erasme Louis Surlet de Chokier, a minor Belgian nobleman, as regent to buy more time for a definitive decision in February 1831.|$|E

According to the agreement, Patassé would remain barred because he was the subject of judicial proceedings. The date of the election was also delayed to March 13, and it was agreed that the constitutional court would not be dissolved, but that it would lose powers regarding the election, which would instead go to CEMI. Subsequently, although Patassé rejected the agreement—saying that he had not authorized Luc Apollinaire Dondon, the first vice-president of the MLPC, to sign it—the MLPC announced on January 26 that it would support the candidacy of Ziguélé, who had previously been running as an independent.|$|E
