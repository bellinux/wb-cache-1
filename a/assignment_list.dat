40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis addresses the critical process of assigning strike aircraft to targets once the targets have been identified: How do we optimally employ available aircraft and weapons {{on the current}} set of targets, {{and how can we}} modify a previously optimized <b>assignment</b> <b>list</b> to face changes in the tactical situation? Our contribution to the strike-planning problem includes (1) a static allocation model in which each aircraft makes at most one sortie during the planning time horizon, (2) a dynamic model in which each aircraft may make more than one sortie during that horizon, and (3) extensions of these models with "persistence incentives," which discourage major plan changes in the results when partial but important changes in the tactical situation necessitate reoptimization. These optimization models are mixed-integer programs that solve in seconds on a personal computer for realistic scenarios with three weapons types, 156 aircraft at seven bases, and 100 potential targets. In a scenario in which two new high-priority targets arise and must be added to an air tasking order with eight original targets, persistence incentives reduce the number of major plan changes from five to two.

40|$|We {{present a}} target {{tracking}} {{system for a}} specific sort of passive radar, that using a Digital Audio/Video Broadcast (DAB/DVB) network for illuminators of opportunity. The system can measure bi-static range and range-rate. Angular information is assumed here unavailable. The DAB/DVB network operates in a single frequency mode; this means the same data stream is broadcast from multiple senders in the same frequency band. This supplies multiple measurements of each target using just one receiver, but introduces an additional ambiguity, as the signals from each sender are indistinguishable. This leads to a significant data association problem: {{as well as the}} usual target/measurement uncertainty there is additional “list ” of illuminators that must be contended with. Our intention is to provide tracks directly in the geographic space, as opposed to a two-step procedure of formation of tracks in (bi-static) range and range-rate space to fuse these onto a map. We offer two solutions: one employing joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) based on an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), and the other a particle filter. For the former, we explain a “super-target ” approach to bring what might otherwise be a three-dimensional <b>assignment</b> <b>list</b> down to the two dimensions the JPDAF needs. The latter approach would seem prohibitive in computation even with these; as such, we discuss the use of a PMHT-like measurement model that greatly reduces the numerical load. 1...|$|E
