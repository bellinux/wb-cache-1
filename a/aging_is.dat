5|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{reported}} an age-related decline in dopamine synthesis and dopamine receptor density (i.e., the number of receptors) in the brain. This decline has been shown to occur in the striatum and extrastriatal regions.C]DOPA |journal=Life Sciences |volume=79 |issue=8 |pages=730–736 |doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2006.02.017 |pmid=16580023 }} Decreases in the D1, D2, and D3 receptors are well documented. The reduction of dopamine with <b>aging</b> <b>is</b> thought to be responsible for many neurological symptoms that increase in frequency with age, such as decreased arm swing and increased rigidity. Changes in dopamine levels may also cause age-related changes in cognitive flexibility.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the initial}} events of Rewrite, Kotarou had been a low-ranking member of Guardian posted in Kazamatsuri, where he {{encounters}} Kagari. In one timeline, Kotarou is badly injured by Kagari, though he is healed into a half-familiar existence by a young Kotori {{with a piece of}} Kagari's ribbon. Kotarou's <b>aging</b> <b>is</b> also slowed as a consequence. Kotarou falls into a coma, and he is administered an amnesiac drug to forget about Gaia and Guardian. By the time he wakes up, Kotori is in junior high school, and Kotarou later graduates junior high with Kotori. He goes on to spend time in high school with the occult research society as shown before. In a different timeline when he encounters Kagari, Kotarou lets her go.|$|E

Thus the process of development and that of aging are coupled by Mis-construction and Mis-re-construction (Misrepair) of the structure of an organism.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the main}} causes of progeroid syndromes is genetic mutations, which lead to defects in the {{cellular}} processes which repair DNA. The DNA damage theory of aging proposes that <b>aging</b> <b>is</b> {{a consequence of the}} accumulation of naturally occurring DNA damages.

25|$|Many {{countries}} require rum to be aged for {{at least}} one year. This <b>aging</b> <b>is</b> commonly performed in used bourbon casks, but may also be performed in other types of wooden casks or stainless steel tanks.

25|$|To improve {{tenderness}} of beef, it {{is often}} aged (i.e., stored refrigerated) to allow endogenous proteolytic enzymes to weaken structural and myofibrillar proteins. Wet <b>aging</b> <b>is</b> accomplished using vacuum packaging to reduce spoilage and yield loss. Dry aging involves hanging primals (usually ribs or loins) in humidity-controlled coolers. Outer surfaces dry out and can support growth of molds (and spoilage bacteria, if too humid), resulting in trim and evaporative losses.|$|E
25|$|Sleep in <b>aging</b> <b>is</b> another equally {{important}} area of research. A common observation {{is that many}} older adults spend time awake in bed after sleep onset in an inability to fall asleep and experience marked decrease in sleep efficiency.

25|$|The DNA damage {{theory of}} aging proposes that <b>aging</b> <b>is</b> a {{consequence}} of unrepaired accumulation of naturally occurring DNA damages. Damage {{in this context is}} a DNA alteration that has an abnormal structure. Although both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage can contribute to aging, nuclear DNA is the main subject of this analysis. Nuclear DNA damage can contribute to aging either indirectly (by increasing apoptosis or cellular senescence) or directly (by increasing cell dysfunction).|$|E

25|$|Accumulation {{theories}} of aging suggest that <b>aging</b> <b>is</b> bodily decline {{that results from}} an accumulation of elements. Elements can be foreign and introduced to the body from the environment. Other elements can be the natural result of cell metabolism. An example of an accumulation theory is the Free Radical Theory of Aging. According to this theory, byproducts of regular cell metabolism called free radicals interact with cellular components such as the cell membrane and DNA and cause irreversible damage.|$|E
25|$|The aging {{follows a}} {{logarithmic}} law. This law defines the decrease of capacitance {{as a percentage}} for a time decade after the soldering recovery time at a defined temperature, for example, in the period from 1 to 10 hours at 20°C. As the law is logarithmic, the percentage loss of capacitance will twice between 1h and 100h and 3 times between 1h and 1000h and so on. So <b>aging</b> <b>is</b> fastest near the beginning, and the capacitance value effectively stabilizes over time.|$|E
