40|$|Storage {{substances}} such as starch grains, {{proteins and}} lipids were studied during the male gametogenesis {{and in the}} mature pollen grain of Ilex paraguariensis St. Hil. (Aquifoliaceae). There are two cycles of amylogenesis and <b>amylolyse.</b> The first cycle lasts until the vacuolated stage when the starch is hydrolyzed and amorphous proteins are stored inside the single vacuole. The next cycle begins after mitosis {{with the formation of}} the vegetative and generative cells. At this point, the young vegetative cell stores many starch grains that are bigger than in the first cycle. During the maturation of the male gametophyte, the starch is hydrolyzed and it is absent in the mature pollen grain. Small lipid droplets surround the young generative cell after the mitosis of the androspore and are dispersed in the vegetative cytoplasm during its maturity. The relationship between the pollen storage substances and the ontogeny of the layers in the sporoderm, formation of the generative cell, and the male germ unit were discussed...|$|E
40|$|The study {{consists}} {{in the production}} of a traditional beer from maize in the Congo. The traditional method of brewing corn malt has three main stages: malting corn, brewing corn malt and fermentation. During the brewing corn malt, endogenous amylase activity is destroyed during the stiffening of the starch to about 80 °C. A pre-cooking of the mash is necessitated to promote <b>amylolyse</b> at 50 °C with an exogenous enzyme. The use of a preparation of α-amylase can liquefy the mash and produce a sweet wort (average density = 12. 5 ° Balling) rich in dextrin corresponding to an apparent extract of 4 ° Balling in beer. The rising profile of the pH of the corn malt mash, from mashing to extract the wort does not affect the pH of the beer produced. This beer, slightly alcoholic (3. 6 % ethanol), is characterized by a nomal acid pH (pH = 4. 15 on average) and a brown color (25 EBC units). Its slight bitterness (21 EBU) and the fine aroma of a beer closer barley produced industrially in the Congo...|$|E
40|$|Um dos maiores sucessos da agricultura brasileira ? o Pr?-?lcool, cuja base de sustenta??o ? a cultura da cana-de-a??car, que deixa um lapso de atividade na entressafra. Em vista disso, diversas usinas v?m investindo em outras culturas, onde o amido ? a fonte prim?ria para a produ??o do ?lcool. A busca de amilases termotolerantes em Bacillus sp. e em riz?bios de solos da Amaz?nia ? uma estrat?gia a ser usada para que as bioind?strias reduzam ou parem de import?-las. Foi feita a muta??o de dois Bacillus sp. contendo amilases com exposi??o ? luz ultravioleta. Foram testadas tamb?m, 40 estirpes de riz?bio quanto ? presen?a de amilases termotolerantes. Foram feitos ensaios enzim?ticos para a verifica??o de atividade amilol?tica em diferentes temperaturas, tempos, pHs, choque t?rmico e termoestabilidade. O mutante de Bacillus sp. ITAAM 023 M mostrou maior ?ndice de amilolise do que o ITAAM 010 M. As amilases dos dois mutantes de Bacillus sp e dos riz?bios mostraram-se bem diversificadas quanto ?s suas caracter?sticas, indicando serem diferentes umas das outras. A temperatura com maior atividade das amilases dos mutantes ITAAM 010 M e ITAAM 023 M foi 100 ?C. A amilase do mutante ITAAM 010 M mostrou maior atividade em 4, 5, e a do ITAAM 023 M em pH 7, 5. Suas amilases mostraram alta sensibilidade ao choque t?rmico. A amilase do mutante ITAAM 010 M mostrou maior termoestabilidade na temperatura de 90 ?C. A do ITAAM 023 M, na temperatura de 80 ?C. A maior atividade mostrada pela amilase do ITAAM 010 M foi de 1, 6 U/mL e a do ITAAM 023 M, 1, 5 U/mL. Dos 40 riz?bios, 17 cresceram bem em meio de cultura contendo amido, 19 produziram halo amilol?tico e 11 se mostraram termof?licos. Os riz?bios INPA R 001 e INPA R 020 mostraram os maiores ?ndices de amilolise. Suas amilases mostraram maior atividade a 90 ?C. A amilase do INPA R 001 mostrou maior atividade a 100 ?C, e a do INPA R 020 a 30 ?C. A amilase do INPA R 001 mostrou maior atividade no pH 4, 5 e a do INPA R 020 no pH 7, 5. Suas amilases mostraram alta sensibilidade ao choque t?rmico. A amilase do INPA R 020 mostrou maior termoestabilidade a 90 ?C e a do INPA R 001 a 100 ?C. A maior atividade amilol?tica mostrada pela amilase do riz?bio INPA R 001 foi de 1, 6 U/mL e a do riz?bio INPA R 020, 7, 5 U/mLOne of {{the biggest}} successes of Brazilian {{agriculture}} is the Pro-Alcohol, whose base of support is the culture of sugar cane, which leaves a lapse of activity in the offseason. In view of this, several alchool industries have been investing in other cultures, where the starch is the primary source for the alcohol production. The pursuit of amylase in thermotolerant Bacillus sp. And rhizobia from Amazonian soils is a strategy {{to be used for}} the bio-industries to reduce or stop importing them. Mutation was made from two Bacillus sp. containing amylases by exposure to ultraviolet light. Also tested were 40 strains of rhizobia for the presence of thermophilic amylases. Enzyme assays were performed to check for amylase activity at different temperatures, times, pHs, thermal shock and thermal stability. The Bacillus sp. ITAAM 023 M mutant showed higher <b>amylolyse</b> than mutant ITAAM 010 M. The amylases of the two Bacillus sp mutants and rhizobias proved quite diverse as their characteristics, indicating they are different from each other. The temperature with higher amylase activity of the mutants ITAAM 010 M and ITAAM 023 M was 100 ?C. Amylase from the mutant ITAAM 010 M showed greater activity in pH 4. 5, and from the ITAAM 023 M at pH 7. 5. Their amylases showed high sensitivity to thermal shock. Amylase from mutant ITAAM 010 M showed high thermostability at temperature of 90 ?C. The amylase from ITAAM 023 M, at a temperature of 80 ?C. The highest activity shown by ITAAM 010 M amylase was 1. 6 U / ml and the ITAAM 023 M, 1. 5 U / mL. From the 40 rhizobia, 17 grew well in culture medium containing starch, 19 produced amylolytic halo, and 11 proved to be thermophiles. Rhizobia INPA INPA R 001 and INPA R 020 showed the highest rates of <b>amylolyse.</b> Their amylase showed greater activity at 90 ?C. Amylase of INPA R 001 showed higher activity at 100 ?C, and from INPA R 020, 30 ?C. Amylase from INPA R 001 showed greater activity at pH 4. 5 and from INPA R 020, at pH 7. 5. Their amylases showed high sensitivity to thermal shock. Amylase from INPA R 020 showed higher thermostability at 90 ?C and from INPA R 001 at 100 ?C.
