50|$|Enes are π-bonded {{molecules}} that contain {{at least one}} active hydrogen atom at the allylic, propargylic, or α-position. Possible ene components include olefinic, acetylenic, <b>allenic,</b> aromatic, cyclopropyl, and carbon-hetero bonds. Usually, the allylic hydrogen of <b>allenic</b> components participates in ene reactions, {{but in the case}} of allenyl silanes, the <b>allenic</b> hydrogen atom α to the silicon substituent is the one transferred, affording a silylalkyne. Phenol can act as an ene component, for example in the reaction with dihydropyran, but high temperatures are required (150-170 °C). Nonetheless, strained enes and fused small ring systems undergo ene reactions at much lower temperatures. In addition, ene components containing C=O, C=N and C=S bonds have been reported, but such cases are rare.|$|E
50|$|The {{biosynthesis}} for β-damascenone {{begins with}} farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) reacting to produce geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) Figure 1. Next two molecules of GGPP are condensed together to produce phytoene by removal of diphosphate and a proton shift catalyzed by the enzyme phytoene synthase (PSY). Phytoene then {{goes through a}} series of desaturation reactions using the enzyme phytoene desaturase (PDS) to produce phytofluene then ζ-carotene. Other enzymes have been found to catalyze this reaction including CrtI and CrtP.The next series of desaturation reactions is catalyzed by the enzyme ζ-carotene desaturase (ZDS) to produced neurosporene followed by lycopene. Other enzymes that are able to catalyze this reaction include CtrI and CrtQ. Next lycopene goes through two cyclization reactions {{with the use of the}} enzyme lycopene β-cyclase first producing γ-carotene followed by the second cyclization producing β-carotene as shown in Figure 2. The mechanism for the cyclization of lycopene to β-carotene is shown in Scheme 2. Next β-carotene reacts with O2 and the enzyme β-carotene ring hydroxylase producing zeaxanthin.Zeaxanthin then reacts with O2, NADPH (H+), and reduced ferredoxin iron-sulfur cluster in the presence of the enzyme zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZE) to produce antheraxanthin which reacts in a similar fashion to produce violaxanthin. Violaxanthin then reacts with the enzyme neoxanthin synthase to form neoxanthin the main precursor for β-damascenone as shown in Figure 3.In order to generate β-damascenone from neoxanthin there are a few more modifications needed. First neoxanthin undergoes an oxidative cleavage to create the grasshopper ketone. The grasshopper ketone then undergoes a reduction to generate the <b>allenic</b> triol. At this stage there are two main pathways the <b>allenic</b> triol can take to produce the final product. The <b>allenic</b> triol can undergo a dehydration reaction to generate either the acetylenic diol or the <b>allenic</b> diol. Finally one last dehydration reaction of either the acetylenic diol or the <b>allenic</b> diol produces the final product β-damascenone as shown in Figure 4. The proposed mechanism for the conversion of the <b>allenic</b> triol to the acetylenic diol is shown in Scheme 3. The proposed mechanism for the conversion of the acetylenic diol to the final product is shown in Scheme 4. This mechanism is known as a Meyer-Schuster rearrangement.|$|E

40|$|Storage of megastigma- 4, 6, 7 -trien- 3, 9 -diol (5), and megastigma- 3, 4 -dien- 7 -yn- 9 -ol (6) in aqueous ethanol {{solution}} at pH 3. 0 and 3. 2 gave exclusively damascenone (1) and damascenone adducts at room temperature. The diol (5) had half-lives for {{the conversion}} of 32 and 48 h at pH 3. 0 and pH 3. 2, respectively. The acetylenic alcohol (6) had half-lives of 40 and 65 h at the same pH levels. In order to study the reactivity of the C- 9 hydroxyl function in 5 and in the previously investigated <b>allenic</b> triol 2, two model compounds, megastigma- 4, 6, 7 -trien- 9 -ol (7) and megastigma- 6, 7 -dien- 9 -ol (8) were synthesized. No 1, 3 -transposition of oxygen to form analogues of damascenone was observed when 7 and 8 were subjected to mild acidic conditions. Such transposition takes place only with highly conjugated acetylenic precursors such as 6 or tertiary <b>allenic</b> alcohols such as 2. The placement of glucose at C- 3 of 5 and at C- 9 of 6 gave the glycosides 9 and 10, respectively. The effect of such glucoconjugation was to increase the observed half-lives {{by a factor of}} only 1. 6 - 1. 7 for the <b>allenic</b> glucoside 9, and by 2. 1 - 2. 2 for the acetylenic glucoside 10. These studies indicate that the effect of glycosylation on damascenone formation is probably not important on the time scale of wine making and maturation. Merran A. Daniel, Carolyn J.
