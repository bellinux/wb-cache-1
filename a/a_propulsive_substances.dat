40|$|When {{a smooth}} {{flagellum}} propels a freely swimming organism, {{the movement of}} the organism is in the opposite direction to the propagation of flagellar waves, while a flagellum bearing projections which remain perpendicular to the flagellar surface during movement may produce <b>a</b> <b>propulsive</b> force {{in the direction of the}} propagate...|$|R
50|$|At T+73.124, the aft dome of {{the liquid}} {{hydrogen}} tank failed, producing <b>a</b> <b>propulsive</b> force that pushed the hydrogen tank into the liquid oxygen tank in the forward part of the external tank. At the same time, the right SRB rotated about the forward attach strut, and struck the intertank structure.|$|R
40|$|To {{generate}} <b>a</b> <b>propulsive</b> force without propellant {{and external}} couplings, {{it has been}} shown that two confined macroscopic and time-varying charge density waves well separated in space are needed. Here, some physical conditions will be proposed to support and maintain these particular collective modes of charge distributions. Comment: 4 page...|$|R
50|$|The {{scope of}} this {{activity}} is to analyse the needs, verify the feasibility, and provide a preliminary definition of <b>a</b> <b>propulsive</b> orbital module (APMAS), based on an existing multi-payload dispenser system, to enhance the mission and performance envelope of existing launch vehicle upper stages for both, Vega and Ariane 6.|$|R
5000|$|Proposals {{have been}} made for [...] "mining" [...] for rocket propulsion, using what is called <b>a</b> <b>Propulsive</b> Fluid Accumulator.

50|$|Another {{possible}} {{method is}} a solar sail. Solar sails use radiation pressure {{in a way}} to achieve <b>a</b> desired <b>propulsive</b> force. The perturbation model due to the solar wind can be used as <b>a</b> model of <b>propulsive</b> force from <b>a</b> solar sail.|$|R
40|$|A {{simple way}} to {{generate}} propulsion at low Reynolds number is to periodically oscillate a passive flexible filament. Here we present a macroscopic experimental investigation of such <b>a</b> <b>propulsive</b> mechanism. <b>A</b> robotic swimmer is constructed and both tail shape and propulsive force are measured. Filament characteristics and the actuation are varied and resulting data are quantitatively compared with existing linear and nonlinear theories...|$|R
50|$|Before being {{injected}} into a heliocentric orbit {{because of the}} lunar flyby, ArgoMoon will perform <b>a</b> <b>propulsive</b> maneuver to close in a geocentric orbit. Second part of the mission will last few months up to a natural decay of the satellite. During this months, the satellite will collect telemetry validating the nanotechnology on board the platform in a radiation environment.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>Propulsive</b> Fluid Accumulator is an {{artificial}} Earth satellite which collects and stores oxygen and other atmospheric gases for in-situ refuelling of high-thrust rockets. This {{eliminates the need}} to lift oxidizer to orbit and therefore brings significant cost benefits. A major portion of the total world payload sent into low earth orbit each year is either liquid oxygen or water.|$|R
30|$|After {{obtaining the}} {{pressure}} field, the average drag is calculate by performing a numerical integration. We study {{an example of}} undulatory motion of the flexible thin delta wing. When the frequency surpasses a critical value, the drag becomes negative i.e. it appears <b>a</b> <b>propulsive</b> force. We notice that {{the distance between the}} wing and the floor influences the drag and the thrust.|$|R
50|$|The book {{outlines}} seven {{missions to}} prepare for and initiate Futurization: (a) Strengthen the capitalist model; (b) Start the cognitive revolution; (c) Build the State of active guarantees; (d) Give the global market <b>a</b> <b>propulsive</b> political architecture; (e) Manage the technological revolution with strong and not weak thought; (f) Steer the artificial ecology; (g) Open the culture of humanism to evolutionary exo-destinies.|$|R
50|$|In {{more modern}} times {{there has been}} limited use of steam for {{rocketry}} - particularly for rocket cars. Steam rocketry works by filling a pressure vessel with hot water at high pressure and opening a valve leading to a suitable nozzle. The drop in pressure immediately boils some {{of the water and}} the steam leaves through a nozzle, creating <b>a</b> <b>propulsive</b> force.|$|R
