25|$|In {{a vicious}} spiral of sectarian violence, civilians were an easy target. On 18 January 1976 an {{estimated}} 1,000–1,500 {{people were killed}} by Maronite forces in the Karantina Massacre, followed two days later by a retaliatory strike on Damour by Palestinian militias. These two massacres prompted a mass exodus of Muslims and Christians, as people fearing retribution fled to areas {{under the control of}} their own sect. The ethnic and religious layout of the residential areas of the capital encouraged this process, and East and West Beirut were increasingly transformed into what was in effect Christian and Muslim Beirut. Also, the number of Maronite leftists who had allied with the LNM, and Muslim conservatives with the government, dropped sharply, as the war revealed itself as <b>an</b> <b>utterly</b> sectarian conflict. Another effect of the massacres was to bring in Yassir Arafat's well-armed Fatah and thereby the Palestine Liberation Organisation {{on the side of the}} LNM, as Palestinian sentiment was by now completely hostile to the Maronite forces.|$|E
25|$|Humphrey Lyttelton, {{primarily}} {{known as}} a jazz trumpeter and bandleader, was invited to be chairman because of {{the role played by}} improvisation in both comedy and jazz music. In the first series Lyttelton shared the role of chairman with Barry Cryer but he made it his own (especially once Cryer replaced Cleese as a regular panellist) and continued as chairman until his death on 25 April 2008. He read the script introducing the programme and segments in <b>an</b> <b>utterly</b> deadpan manner. He claimed the secret was just to read what was in front of him without understanding why it was funny. He adopted the grumpy persona of someone who would really rather be somewhere else, which he attributed to worrying that, surrounded by four professional comedians, he would have nothing worthwhile to chip in. He did occasionally depart from the script, however, often bringing the house down with an ad-lib. He was credited by the regular panellists as being the chief reason for the show's longevity.|$|E
25|$|Marcion was a Church leader from Sinope (present-day Turkey), who preached in Rome around 150CE, but was {{expelled}} and {{started his own}} congregation, which spread throughout the Mediterranean. He rejected the Old Testament, and followed a limited Christian canon, which included only a redacted version of Luke, and ten edited letters of Paul. Some scholars do not consider {{him to be a}} gnostic, but his teachings clearly resemble some Gnostic teachings. He preached a radical difference between the God of the Old Testament, the Demiurge, and the highest God, who had sent Jesus to the earth to free mankind from the tyranny of the Jewish Law. Like the Gnostics, Marcion argued that Jesus was essentially a divine spirit appearing to men {{in the shape of a}} human form, and not someone in a true physical body. Marcion held that the heavenly Father (the father of Jesus Christ) was <b>an</b> <b>utterly</b> alien god; he had no part in making the world, nor any connection with it.|$|E

25|$|In Series 9, Capaldi {{described}} his character as a 'thrill-seeker' who is confronting danger where he soon realises {{that he is}} 'one of the luckiest creatures in all of time and space' and that 'life is short even at two-thousand years'. According to Coleman regarding Clara's bond with The Doctor inquring if she had feelings for him she stated “She’s totally in love with him, always has been. It’s its own kind of love. He is her hero but she would be very reluctant to tell him that. It’s a doctor-and-companion love, and there’s nothing else like it really.” “They’re kind of freed of their issues and in a wonderful place together. Previously {{she was trying to}} keep him under control yet now the two of them are going ‘Come on, lets jump, lets do it’, egging each other on really, and being more and more reckless,” she teased. Capaldi stated “It’s sort of <b>an</b> <b>utterly</b> platonic bond, which is quite unusual. The problem is the Doctor knows a lot more than he ever says. He knows Clara’s fate. He knows the fate of all his companions before they do.” Ultimately it has been confirmed by both Capaldi and Coleman that the Doctor and Clara's relationship is romantic in nature.|$|E
25|$|Queen La (Diahann Carroll) – In the {{original}} novels, a high priestess of a blood cult who {{fell in love}} with Tarzan. In her adaptation for the series, she is {{a former member of the}} Waziri tribe and <b>an</b> <b>utterly</b> vicious sorceress who rules over the abandoned city of Opar, where she lords over the Leopard Men, leopards whom she has changed into humanoid form to serve her. She falls in love with Tarzan after he comes to rescue Jane's father from the Leopard Men, who were capturing males as potential husbands for La. Her attempts to seduce Tarzan fail every time, as his loyalty is firmly with Jane, and in almost every encounter La is trying to hurt Jane and take Tarzan for herself. She could actually be considered to be Jane's rival for Tarzan's affections. Her magic staff is eventually shattered by Jane, turning La to dust and the Leopard men back into ordinary leopards. Her spirit still lingers and tries to steal Jane's body and restore her staff. After some forced body switching and getting inside Tarzan, she is eventually forced inside the body of a rat and the staff is taken by a Waziri elder who was determined to end her evil, trapping her in the rodent form.|$|E
500|$|NBA {{players and}} {{officials}} were saddened {{at the loss}} of a player they universally remembered {{as a symbol of the}} sport. His lifelong on-court rival and personal friend Bill Russell stated [...] "the fierceness of our competition bonded us together for eternity", and Celtics coach Red Auerbach praised Chamberlain as vital for the success of the entire NBA. Ex-Lakers teammate Jerry West remembered him as <b>an</b> <b>utterly</b> dominant, yet friendly and humorous player, and fellow Hall-of-Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Johnny Kerr, Phil Jackson and Wes Unseld called Chamberlain one of the greatest players in the history of the sport.|$|E

50|$|<b>As</b> <b>utterly</b> wretched as {{existence}} was in Dogpatch, {{there was one}} place even worse. Frigid, faraway Lower Slobbovia was fashioned as a pointedly political satire of backward nations and foreign diplomacy, and remains a contemporary reference. Its hapless residents were perpetually waist-deep in several feet of snow, and icicles hung from almost every frostbitten nose. The favorite dish of the starving natives was raw polar bear (and vice versa). Lower Slobbovians spoke with burlesque pidgin-Russian accents; the miserable frozen wasteland of Capps invention abounded in incongruous Yiddish humor.|$|R
500|$|Shaw's largest-scale {{theatrical}} {{work was}} Back to Methuselah, written in 1918–20 and staged in 1922. Weintraub {{describes it as}} [...] "Shaw's attempt to fend off 'the bottomless pit of <b>an</b> <b>utterly</b> discouraging pessimism'". This cycle of five interrelated plays depicts evolution, {{and the effects of}} longevity, from the Garden of Eden to the year 31,920 AD. Critics found the five plays strikingly uneven in quality and invention. The original run was brief, and the work has been revived infrequently. Shaw felt he had exhausted his remaining creative powers in the huge span of this [...] "Metabiological Pentateuch". He was now sixty-seven, and expected to write no more plays.|$|E
500|$|Leonard Maltin {{rated the}} film a [...] "BOMB" [...] {{in his book}} Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide, and called it a [...] "Tiresome {{follow-up}} to Resident Evil that plays more like a remake." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a score of half a star out of four, saying: [...] "The movie is <b>an</b> <b>utterly</b> meaningless waste of time. There {{was no reason to}} produce it, except to make money, {{and there is no reason}} to see it, except to spend money. It is a dead zone, a film without interest, wit, imagination or even entertaining violence and special effects. [...] Parents: If you encounter teenagers who say they liked this movie, do not let them date your children." ...|$|E
500|$|Rock critic Robert Christgau, {{writing for}} Rolling Stone {{magazine}} in 2007, called Younger Than Yesterday [...] "the Byrds' first mature album, {{a blend of}} space-flight twang and electric hoedown infused with the imminent glow of 1967 yet underlined with crackling realism." [...] Critic John Nork gave the album a glowing review on the Analogue Planet website, calling it [...] "a scrumptious smorgasbord of eclectic musical styles and groundbreaking innovation", before concluding that [...] "in every sense, Younger Than Yesterday is <b>an</b> <b>utterly</b> brilliant album, arguably the Byrds' best." [...] Alan Bisbort, writing in the book Rhino's Psychedelic Trip, described Younger Than Yesterday as [...] "an essential snapshot of an incense-scented, acid-drenched world in motion: a kaleidoscope whose every turn yielded some fantastic window on the age." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing in {{the book}} 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die, author Tom Moon refers to [...] "the upbeat single 'What Is Life'" [...] {{as an example of}} how Harrison [...] "grabs what he needs from his old band – that insinuating hook sense – and uses it to frame <b>an</b> <b>utterly</b> {{comfortable}} metaphysical discourse". Alan Clayson describes [...] "What Is Life" [...] as a seemingly [...] "lovey-dovey pop song" [...] that [...] "craftily renewed the simplistic tonic-to-dominant riff cliché", while Simon Leng credits Harrison's [...] "innate ability to write very fine pop-rock songs" [...] and deems the result [...] "as innovative an exercise in rock-soul as The Temptations' 'Cloud Nine'". Among Harrison biographers, only Ian Inglis is less than enthusiastic, acknowledging that Barham's orchestration and the other musicians give the track [...] "undoubted excitement and energy", but lamenting that the song offers [...] "little overall coherence between words and music".|$|E
500|$|Taft {{had ordered}} {{government}} officials not {{to comment on}} the fracas. In January 1910, Pinchot forced the issue by sending a letter to Iowa Senator Dolliver alleging that but for the actions of the Forestry Service, Taft would have approved a fraudulent claim on public lands. According to Pringle, this [...] "was <b>an</b> <b>utterly</b> improper appeal from an executive subordinate to the legislative branch of the government and an unhappy president prepared to separate Pinchot from public office". Pinchot was dismissed, much to his delight, and he sailed for Europe to lay his case before Roosevelt. A congressional investigation followed, which cleared Ballinger by majority vote, but the administration was embarrassed when Glavis' attorney, Louis D. Brandeis, proved that the Wickersham report had been backdated, which Taft belatedly admitted. The Ballinger–Pinchot affair caused progressives and Roosevelt loyalists to feel that Taft had turned his back on Roosevelt's agenda.|$|E
500|$|Evan Sawdey from PopMatters {{gave the}} song a {{negative}} review, saying [...] "'Marry the Night' very much {{wants to be}} top-notch Justice knockoff, but by adding a bridge of upbeat platitudes and <b>an</b> <b>utterly</b> pointless instrumental section after the 3:30 mark, she ultimately winds up weakening the power of her 'let’s take the night' rallying cry". Kerri Mason from Billboard found influences of gothic rock in it, but went on to call it an [...] "unapologetic disco-powered pop" [...] {{that could have been}} a production number on Gaga's debut album, The Fame (2008). Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph gave an analogy with rock musician [...] "Meat Loaf going to the disco", while describing the song. NMEs Dan Martin felt that the song, although impressive, was conservative as the opening song of Born This Way. He further found similarities to the work of Moroder and influences of Bruce Springsteen's 1975 single, [...] "Born to Run".|$|E

500|$|At 01:48, Akatsuki and Hiei {{turned on}} large {{searchlights}} and illuminated Atlanta only [...] away—almost point-blank range for the battleship's main guns. Several ships {{on both sides}} spontaneously began firing, and the formations of the two adversaries quickly disintegrated. Realizing that his force was almost surrounded by Japanese ships, Callaghan issued the confusing order, [...] "Odd ships fire to starboard, even ships fire to port", though no pre-battle planning had assigned any such identity numbers to reference, and the ships were no longer in coherent formation. Most of the remaining U.S. ships then opened fire, although several had to quickly change their targets to attempt to comply with Callaghan's order. As the ships from the two sides intermingled, they battled each other in <b>an</b> <b>utterly</b> confused and chaotic short-range mêlée in which superior Japanese optic sights and well-practiced night battle drill proved deadly effective. Afterward, an officer on Monssen likened it to [...] "a barroom brawl after the lights had been shot out".|$|E
500|$|... "What Lies Below" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. The A.V. Club contributor Todd VanDerWerff graded the episode with a B-, explaining that despite some nice moments, it was [...] "an {{episode of the}} show that started out utterly predictably, continued along <b>an</b> <b>utterly</b> predictable path and yet somehow got fairly enjoyable by the end just through sheer force of will {{on the part of}} the cast." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler also found the episode average and predictable, as it lacked [...] "much of the quintessential storytelling elements that, once upon a time, made this one of the best shows on TV." [...] Like many other critics, Isler thought the episode was too similar to The X-Files, and gave it 7.0/10. TV Squad columnist Jane Boursaw thought Walter discovering a cure was a little far-fetched, and wished Broyles was a greater part of the show. Television Without Pity gave the episode a B+.|$|E
500|$|Corey Taylor touted Stone Sour as [...] "melodic {{hard rock}} with content and initiative." [...] Jason D. Taylor of Allmusic noted that {{although}} it is not displayed on early Slipknot releases, [...] " [...] Taylor has the ability to actually sing," [...] citing Alice in Chains and Soundgarden as influences. Jason Taylor went on to state the album gets better after multiple listens. Jeff Modzelewski of 411mania wrote the album mixed [...] "hostility, reservation, brutality and melody." [...] According to Modzelewski, the album has a [...] "mainstream sound" [...] with each of the band's members standing out during one song or another. Don Kaye of Blabbermouth.net felt the message of [...] "Bother" [...] did not differ from Slipknot tracks, but was [...] "presented in <b>an</b> <b>utterly</b> different musical vein". Kaye also felt the album [...] "holds its own ... in terms of heaviness and power." [...] "The band knows how to put together an energetic rocker," [...] wrote NY Rock; elements such as the [...] "melodic twist to the songs ... will please hardcore and metal fans." ...|$|E

500|$|Hidden in {{a remote}} {{mountain}} valley, Bors commands the world's last government. The microstate is tightly centralized around him, and he manages it bureaucratically for optimum efficiency in all {{sectors of the economy}} and military. The effect is [...] "an accurate and detailed reproduction of a society two centuries gone." [...] Bors is immediately established as <b>an</b> <b>utterly</b> necessary figure in his society and is quickly escorted back into service {{as the leader of the}} government by Fowler. A personal assistant as well as mechanic to Bors, Fowler maintains a pretension of loyalty to the robot, but privately recognizes that his society is stagnant and that its leader is becoming mentally unbalanced. Pessimistic, he expresses cynicism regarding the subservient role humans in his society play to Bors. He is contrasted with Peter Green, a genuinely loyal assistant to the robot, who is among the few humans trusted to oversee his body while it is unconscious for repair. Though loyal to his leader, Green nonetheless draws Bors' distrust as the robot's paranoia steadily grows.|$|E
500|$|Planescape: Torment {{received}} widespread {{critical acclaim}} upon its release, but only {{made a small}} profit. GameSpot's reviewer stated [...] "It's clearly the best traditional computer role-playing game of the year", a comment which the website would later expand to [...] "one of the greatest ever". Allen Rausch, writing for GameSpy's 2004 retrospective [...] "A History of D Video Games", commented that Black Isle Studios [...] "went way over the top for this one, crafting <b>an</b> <b>utterly</b> unique experience {{that has yet to}} be equaled by any RPG since". The gameplay was often compared to Baldur's Gate, another Interplay game that used the same engine as Planescape: Torment. Robert Mayer of Computer Games Magazine commented that [...] "this is one dark and interesting game. There's lots of macabre humor, some rather deviant sexual references, and enough weirdness to send the devotees of Tolkienesque fantasy running for their copies of The Hobbit." [...] Kieron Gillen of PC Gamer UK commented that [...] "Planescape: Torment is attempting to be iconoclastic in the most stereotyped of genres. We’re cheering it on." ...|$|E
500|$|Adrian Caffery of the Birmingham Mail gave a mixed {{review of}} the show at the city's Symphony Hall. While he was {{complimentary}} of Lewis' vocals performances {{on most of the}} original tracks, most notably on [...] "Ave Maria", which he described as demonstrating [...] "an amazing transformation to opera diva", he was critical of Lewis' decision to include seven cover songs on the set list. Although Caffery wrote that [...] "Run", [...] "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face", [...] "Ave Maria", and [...] "A Moment Like This" [...] – the last of which he described as [...] "cheesy" [...] – were to be expected, as Lewis had recorded them for previous albums. However, he disapproved of [...] "Time After Time", labelling it [...] "ok", and called the Sam Smith covers [...] "instantly forgettable". He concluded by writing: [...] "There was enough evidence to suggest Leona is capable of staging <b>an</b> <b>utterly</b> mesmerising show from start to finish – just not this time". A critic from The Bristol Post wrote that Lewis [...] "dazzled" [...] the audience who [...] " [...] Leona's impressive vocals and stunning songs", placing emphasis on her rendition of [...] "Time After Time".|$|E
