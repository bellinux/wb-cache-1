40|$|This {{report is}} based on the {{challenges}} FMC Technologies has due to measuring the amount of hydraulic oil inside a piston <b>accumulator</b> <b>tank</b> {{on the bottom of the}} sea. It is favorably to know at any given time how much hydraulic oil is left in the tank; in time some of the oil will be lost to the environment due to its function. There are several hydraulic accumulator tanks attached to a subsea Xmas tree, each operating on different system but perform the same main function, which is to send hydraulic oil to an actuator. The actuator uses the hydraulic oil as energy to open and close valves. Today FMC Technologies does not have any satisfying solution regarding this problem; rather they use prior experience of how long it takes before an <b>accumulator</b> <b>tank</b> needs to be refilled. In collaboration with FMC Technologies a solution to the problem has been developed for measuring the remaining hydraulic oil inside the tank, where a measuring system were put on the top of the <b>accumulator</b> <b>tank</b> protected by a housing.

40|$|Reactivity {{accident}} scenarios could {{originate from}} internal boron dilution {{in the primary}} system of a nuclear pressurized water reactor type (PWR or VVER). In essence the phenomena is caused by boron dilution following vaporization and condensation within the primary coolant system as a result a reduction in primary system mass inventory, e. g. during a {{loss of coolant accident}} (LOCA). When the liquid level in the reactor vessel falls below the hot leg elevation, steam begins to flow to the steam generators and condenses there. This steam carries no boron, thus boron concentration in the cold leg loop seals begins to decrease. If for some reason this water plug with low boron concentration enters the core without any major mixing with the borated coolant, the result is a positive reactivity insertion. The paper presents an analysis using the RELAP 5 Mod 3. 3 for a small break LOCA in one cold leg pipe of a Russian-type VVER- 1000 nuclear reactor. The boundary conditions consider, as far as possible, a realistic situation in which the four <b>accumulator</b> <b>tanks</b> (SIT) and the three low pressure injection systems (LPIS) are available for core cooling but one of the three high pressure injection systems (HPIS), not serving the damaged loop, is not available. A range of break sizes (from 30 cm 2 to 120 cm 2) have been investigated in order to identify a range of potentially adverse conditions. From the results obtained, in some calculations boron dilution is observed in some loop seals. The worst situation was found to occur at the 40 cm 2 break size. However, due to ECCS injection and mixing an increase of boron concentration is observed in the upper parts of the downcomer.

40|$|This {{report is}} a result of the {{research}} undertaken in the project TESS - Traffic Emissions, Socioeconomic valuation and Socioeconomic measures. In this report, we have studied the cost-effectiveness of particulate matter (PM) reductions from local emission sources in the Stockholm area. The input in the analysis is cost and effectiveness data collected from other studies and reports on reductions in emissions from traffic and residential heating. Contrary to other cost-effectiveness studies we have also included abatement measures where the effect is mainly due to adaptations in behavior. One example is congestion charging that we have assumed have a zero cost. We have also investigated the effect of different targeting strategies. Either the focus is on achieving air quality limit values for PM 10 or the focus is on improvement in human health. In the first case we have assumed that the aim is to reduce emissions of PM 10. In the second case the aim has been formulated as a reduction of the number of years of life lost (YOLL) in the population that would result if we reduce the concentrations of particulate matter in the city. The cost-effective analysis is done with a simple linear programming model. According to our results, congestion charging, a change to low-emission vehicles and installation of <b>accumulator</b> <b>tanks</b> are the least cost abatement measures irrespective of the target used in the analysis. For congestion charging and low-emission vehicles this is due to the assumption made that the abatement cost is zero. Thereafter however, the choice of measures depends on the choice of target. While less use of studded tires is efficient in order to reduce PM 10 emissions, this is not a measure that has a large impact on the reduction of YOLL. This result relies on the assumptions made regarding the mortality impact of non-exhaust PM versus combustion PM...|$|R
40|$|Upward and {{downward}} two-phase {{heat and}} mass transfer {{has been considered}} in the present paper. The heat and mass transfer with the condenser located below the evaporator has been obtained by inserting an <b>accumulator</b> <b>tank</b> in the liquid line of a loop thermosyphon and enforcing a pressure pulsation. In previous papers these heat transfer devices have been called pulsated two phase thermosyphons (PTPT). A mini PTPT has been experimentally investigated. It has shown a stable periodic heat transfer regime weakly influenced by {{the position of the}} condenser with respect to the evaporator. In contrast a classical loop mini thermosyphon (diameter of connecting pipes 4 mm) did not achieve a stable functioning for the investigated level differences between evaporator and condenser lower than 0. 37 m. The present study shows that the functioning of a PTPT device does not directly depend on the level difference or the presence of noncondensable gas. In order to obtain a natural circulation in mini or micro loops, a periodically operating heat transfer regime should therefore be considered. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The In-Situ {{production}} of propellants for Martian and Lunar missions has been heavily discussed {{since the mid}} 1990 's.

Two key technology development efforts are required: large refrigeration systems (cryocoolers) to perform the liquefaction and high performance insulation within a soft vacuum environment. Several different concepts of operation may be employed to liquefy the propellants based on how and where these two technologies are implemented. The concepts that were investigated include: using an <b>accumulator</b> <b>tank</b> to store the propellant until it is needed, liquefying in the flow stream going into the tank, and liquefying in the flight propellant tank itself.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this bachelor´s report is to expand the {{knowledge}} about heat supply of a small house in Malmö. The heat supply will be provided from solar panels in combination to two accumulator tanks which will storage the up heated water and a pellet boiler. The technique used here is warmth storage in water over seasons, which will provide the total need of heating for the house. Accumulator tanks in combination to solar panels gets more and more common in Sweden but this far it´s unusual {{to use it for}} storage over seasons. This report will highlight many of the difficulties associated whit heat storage and give information about a system's possible design and function. The design of this system is decided early on. An <b>accumulator</b> <b>tank</b> is placed 2 meters down in the earth on the backside of the house. This tank is constructed to fit this particular house. It´s supposed to store the heated water which will be used the following winter. The warm water is provided by the solar panels when they have their highest capacity and the need of heating is non-existing. The big question is if it´s possible to support this house in Malmö by energy from the sun as main source and pellets as secondary source? After a couple of guesses, limitations, see "Avgränsningar" below, and calculations the conclusions are that the first year of use the tank will be loaded between May and February. During this period the house will not be heated so best would be if this was done before the habitants move in. The conditions will be very different the first year compared to following years, since the water has to be heated up from a low temperature.

40|$|Reactivity {{accident}} scenarios {{can occur}} originated by internal boron dilution {{in the primary}} system of a nuclear pressurized water reactor type (PWR or VVER). In essence the problem is caused by boron dilution following vaporization and condensation of the primary system coolant in case of decrease of primary system mass inventory, for example during a small-break {{loss of coolant accident}} (SB-LOCA) that may include boiling in the core with condensation of steam in the steam generators. When the liquid level in the reactor vessel decreases below the hot leg elevation, steam begins to flow to the steam generators and condenses there. This steam carries no boron and thus boron concentration in the cold leg loop seals begins to decrease. If for some reason this water plug with low boron concentration begins to flow towards the core and enters it without any major mixing with the borated coolant, the result is a positive reactivity insertion. The paper presents an analysis by RELAP 5 Mod 3. 3 code [1] of a small break LOCA of 20 cm 2 area in the lower plenum of a four-loop PWR nuclear reactor. The boundary conditions of the calculations consider the eight <b>accumulator</b> <b>tanks</b> available, two/four low pressure injection systems (LPIS) available, and two of the four high pressure injection systems (HPIS) available. Sensitivity calculations were performed, regarding among other things, the boron concentration in the Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) and reactor cooling system (RCS) from Design Basis Accident (DBA) to beyond DBA conditions. From the results obtained, in some calculations boron dilution is observed in more than one loop seal. The situation in which the plugs in the loop seals are transported to the core without mixing with other borated water led to a potentially hazardous situation for four calculations in which initial conditions were far from DBA. It is important to emphasize that the present study has not the objective of a safety analysis of the NPP involved, but it should be considered inside research activities regarding the boron dilution issue...|$|R

40|$|Göteborg Energi is {{the sole}} {{provider}} of district heat in the Gothenburg region in Sweden. By the year 2030, the generation of heat in Gothenburg is planned {{to be free of}} fossil fuels. The plans include the construction of a biomass-fuelled combined heat and power plant and an increased use of bio gas. These plans are already set, but there are many possible additional measures that could be implemented in the district heating system that will help to meet the targets set for 2030. However, the future is hard to predict and {{it may be difficult to}} choose which measures to implement. In order to assess the possible measures to be implemented, an optimisation study through the software GAMS has been performed in this thesis: a model of the generation of district heating in Gothenburg has been created and 4 different scenarios where measures to decrease total system running costs have been implemented by the year 2032 have been studied. These measures are: seasonal thermal energy storage, thermal energy storage in buildings, thermal energy storage in a hot water <b>accumulator</b> <b>tank</b> and an increased use of exhaust air heat pumps in buildings. The district heating system is affected by the electric system in several ways through the price of electricity. In the future, when more electricity is generated from intermittent sources such as wind or solar, the price of electricity will be fluctuating and the district heating system must be able to handle these fluctuations. The optimisation is performed on an hourly basis and includes hourly prices for electricity that have been previously simulated for 2032. It was found that it is possible to achieve a fossil-free generation of heat in Gothenburg by 2032. The studied measures all give system cost savings in the form of reduced running costs. By introducing thermal energy storage in the district heating system, substantial savings in running costs can be achieved, as well as reduced heat load variations on both daily and seasonal levels. By using buildings as thermal energy storage, similar cost savings as for an <b>accumulator</b> <b>tank</b> can be achieved, but at much lower investment cost. A seasonal thermal energy storage will give large cost savings and heavily reduced heat load variations, but at a very high investment cost. With an increased amount of exhaust air heat pumps in buildings, the total running costs of the heat generation system can be reduced. However, these heat pumps will give a small increase in heat load variation on a system level...|$|E

This project analyzed the different factors contributing to the soft brake condition using a fishbone diagram. A low cost tool to objectively measure brake pedal feel was developed and tested. Using this tool we found a negative linear correlation between residual air in the brake system and brake pedal feel.

40|$|A two-fluid {{accumulator}} {{has been}} designed, built, and demonstrated {{to provide an}} acceptably close approximation to constant differential static pressure between two fluids over the full ranges of (1) accumulator stroke, (2) rates of flow of the fluids, and (3) common static pressure applied to the fluids. Prior differential- pressure two-fluid accumulators are generally not capable of maintaining acceptably close approximations to constant differential pressures. The inadequacies of a typical prior differential-pressure two-fluid accumulator can be summarized as follows: The static differential pressure is governed by the intrinsic spring rate (essentially, the stiffness) of an <b>accumulator</b> <b>tank.</b> The spring rate can be tailored through selection of the tank-wall thickness, selection of the number and/or shape of accumulator convolutions, and/or selection of accumulator material(s). Reliance on the intrinsic spring rate of the tank results in three severe limitations: (1) The spring rate and the expulsion efficiency tend to be inversely proportional to each other: that is to say, as the stiffness (and thus the differential pressure) is increased, the range of motion of the accumulator is reduced. (2) As the applied common static pressure increases, the differential pressure tends to decrease. An additional disadvantage, {{which may or may}} not be considered limiting, depending on the specific application, is that an increase in stiffness entails an increase in weight. (3) The additional weight required by a low expulsion efficiency accumulator eliminates the advantage given to such gas storage systems. The high expulsion efficiency provided by this two-fluid accumulator allows for a lightweight, tightly packaged system, which can be used in conjunction with a fuel cell-based system...|$|E

Design {{and operation of}} steam plants are particularly complex when the steam supply is required for short periods and with a varying time schedules. To fulfil the discontinuous needs of steam users, avoiding the steam boiler oversizing to the peak value of the steam request, a thermal energy storage (TES) system can be adopted. The proper sizing of TES systems, which, in this application, is constituted by a steam accumulator vessel installed between the steam generator and the consumer, cannot {{be based on the}} sole initial and final state conditions of the steam storage, since a performance prediction of the process time-evolution is also required.

The blowdown phase of a large break LOCA is the initial period of the transient during which the RCS departs from equilibrium conditions, and heat from fission product decay, hot internals, and the vessel continues to be transferred to the reactor coolant. The blowdown phase of the transient ends when the RCS pressure falls to a value approaching that of the containment atmosphere. In the refill phase of a LOCA, which immediately follows the blowdown phase, reactor coolant inventory has vacated the core through steam flashing and ejection out through the break. The core is essentially in adiabatic heatup. The balance of accumulator inventory is then available to help fill voids in the lower plenum and reactor vessel downcomer so as to establish a recovery level {{at the bottom of the}} core and ongoing reflood of the core with the addition of safety injection (SI) water. The accumulators are pressure vessels partially filled with borated water and pressurized with nitrogen gas. The accumulators are passive components, since no operator or control actions are required in order for them to perform their function. Internal <b>accumulator</b> <b>tank</b> pressure is sufficient to discharge the accumulator contents to the RCS, if RCS pressure decreases below the accumulator pressure. Each accumulator is piped into an RCS cold leg via an accumulator line and is isolated from the RCS by a motor operated isolation valve and two check valves in series...|$|E
40|$|Results of {{experimental}} study {{of the effects of}} contact condensation of steam–gas mixture on the operation of VVER passive safety systems and steam generator in emergency condensation mode are presented. Contact condensation takes place when subcooled liquid is supplied in the <b>accumulator</b> <b>tank</b> of VVER reactor auxiliary passive core flooding system (the HA- 2 system) in the presence of accumulated non-condensable gases. Water supplied to hydro accumulators can be used for increasing the operating time of VVER steam generator in the emergency condensation mode and for ensuring core cooling during longer time. Low liquid outlet velocity (less than 1 m/s) caused by the necessity to ensure safety systems operation in passive mode constitutes the distinguishing feature of the investigated processes. Experiments were conducted on the test facility with parameters typical for the primary cooling loop of the reactor facility 24 h after the accident initiation for different concentrations of gas in the steam–gas mixture. Nitrogen and helium, which replaces hydrogen for the purposes of safety assurance, were used as the non-condensable gases. It was established according to the results of experiments that the increase of concentration of non-condensable gas within the volume of HA- 2 hydro accumulator model up to 45 % leads to the reduction of intensity of contact condensation of steam from the steam–gas mixture by ∼ 29 % in the experiment with nitrogen and by ∼ 57 % in the experiment with helium. The obtained experimental data can be used for numerical simulation of emergency processes in the VVER reactor facility during operation of passive safety systems taking into account the removal of steam–gas mixture from steam generator by supplying the subcooled liquid jet into the volume HA- 2 accumulator tanks...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{report was}} carried out to study {{experimentally}} the water-assisted injection molding process of glass fiber-reinforced polyamide- 6 (Nylon- 6) composites. Experiments were carried out on an 80 ton injection molding machine equipped with a lab scale water injection system, which included a water pump, a water injection pin, a pressure <b>accumulator,</b> a water <b>tank</b> equipped with a temperature regulator, and a control circuit. The materials used were Nylon and 30 % glass fiber-filled Nylon composites. A spiral mold cavity was used to mold the composites. After molding, the lengths of water penetration in molded parts were measured. The effects of different processing parameters on the lengths of water penetration were determined: melt temperature, mold temperature, melt-filling speed, short-shot size, water pressure, water temperature, water hold, and water injection delay time. Mechanical property tests were performed on the water-assisted injection molded parts. X-ray diffraction was also employed to identify the structural parameters of the materials. In addition, the in-mold temperature distribution of the polymeric materials during the cooling process was measured. Irregular water penetration in molded parts was observed, and water temperature was found to affect the crystallinity distribution of molded parts. Nevertheless, its effects on the tensile properties of molded materials were relatively limited. KEY WORDS: water-assisted injection molding, glass fiber-reinforced Nylon- 6 composites, processing parameters, mechanical property, structural parameters, temperature distribution...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a combined experimental and numerical program directed at defining a cost/effective methodology for conjugate heat transfer CFD simulations of engine water cooling jackets. As {{a first step}} in the process, deficiencies in current numerical strategies for the analysis of conjugate heat transfer problems under typical engine operating conditions are exposed and commented. Results are shown form a wide validation program based on the comparison between experimental measurements from a test facility at Villanova University and CFD predictions at the University of Modena. On the experimental side, the test apparatus consists of a test section, pump, <b>accumulator</b> <b>tank,</b> rejection heat exchanger and required pumping. The test section is provided with a constant volumetric flow rate, and consists of a cylindrical aluminum body with a drilled horizontal flow channel. The section is heated by ten cartridge heaters located at a constant radial distance from the cylinder axis. The test section is connected to the flow loop by means of two calming sections, respectively at the cylinder inlet and exit. Twenty thermocouples are used to measure the test section local temperature along a radial plane cutting the cylinder. Water / ethylene-glycol binary mixture and pure water are tested and compared during the experimental program, in order to reproduce a set of thermal situations {{as close as possible to}} actual engine cooling system operation. On the CFD side, an extensive program reproducing the experiments is carried out in order to assess the predictive capabilities of some of the most commonly used eddy viscosity models available in literature. Both non-evaporating and evaporating conditions are tested, showing severe limitations to the use of simplified boiling models to correctly capture the complex interaction between turbulent boundary layer and vapor bubble dynamics. In order to overcome the above stated deficiencies under boiling conditions, a methodology is then proposed to both improve the accuracy of the CFD forecasts and reduce the computational costs of the simulations. A few preliminary results from the validation process are shown and briefly discussed at the end of the paper...|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} a {{study has been}} done {{regarding}} different heating systems on which are the most comprehensive with solar heating systems. The report has also been focusing if solar power {{can be used as}} a primary heating source for supplying more than 50 % of the buildings total heating production. The University of Dalarna constructed a demo-house for this purpose and according to calculations the total solar usage is more than 50 %. This house has been made for reference regarding the design of the heating system of property 5 : 37. Further studies have been made to compare different heating systems that are compatible with a solar system, where the compared systems purpose is to be independent of direct using electricity. A system of this design is regarded as sustainable according to environmental as economic issues. The following heating systems have been analyzed in combination with solar energy; Geothermal heating, long- distance heating and bio energy heating. The result of text study shows that the design of the heating system should be installed with an accumulation tank as a central component for distribution of heat. The positioning of the house is to be as to the south as possible and the solar panels should be installed with an elevation of 70 degrees for better use of the spring and autumn sun. Vacuum panels should be installed instead of plain panels since they have a better utilization factor during spring and autumn. The efficiency of the <b>accumulator</b> <b>tank</b> is dependent on how well the warm and cold water in the tank is separated. The water flow circulating the system should be as even as possible with low speed which keeps the water in the tank separated. Research shows that installing a separate heatexchanger for the tap water serves for an improved separation of water in the tank. As a result of the text study the design of the heating system at property 5. 37 has been made. Nine solar panels are to be installed of a total area of 20, 7 m 2 and with an 70 degree angle on the southern roof. Three accumulation tanks with a total volume of 2250 liters have been installed to store the solar heating energy during longer periods. A separate heat-exchanger for the tap water has been installed as well...|$|E
