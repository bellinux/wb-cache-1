50|$|Although surplus <b>line</b> <b>insurers</b> {{are still}} {{regulated}} by the states (or countries) {{in which they are}} actually admitted, the disadvantages of obtaining insurance from a surplus <b>line</b> <b>insurer</b> are that the policy will usually be written on a nonstandard form (that is, not from the Insurance Services Office), and if the insurer collapses, its insureds in states in which it is nonadmitted will not enjoy certain types of protection available to insureds in the states (or countries) in which the insurer is admitted. However, for persons trying to obtain coverage for unusual risks, the choice is usually between a surplus <b>line</b> <b>insurer</b> or no coverage at all.|$|R

5000|$|An {{important}} {{artifact of}} the state-based insurance regulation {{system in the}} United States is the dichotomy between admitted and surplus insurers. Insurers in the U.S. may be [...] "admitted", meaning {{that they have been}} formally admitted to a state's insurance market by the state insurance commissioner, and are subject to various state laws governing organization, capitalization, policy forms, rate approvals, and claims handling. Or they may be [...] "surplus", meaning that they are nonadmitted in a particular state but are willing to write coverage there. Surplus <b>line</b> <b>insurers</b> are supposed to underwrite only very unusual or difficult-to-insure risks, to prevent them from undermining each state's ability to regulate its insurance market. Although experienced insurance brokers are well aware of what risks an admitted insurer will not accept, they must document a [...] "diligent effort" [...] at actually shopping around a risk to several admitted insurers (typically three, who will promptly reject it) before applying for coverage with a surplus <b>line</b> <b>insurer.</b>|$|R

5000|$|To relieve {{insurers}} and brokers of that tedious and time-consuming chore, many states now maintain [...] "export lists" [...] of risks {{that the state}} insurance commissioner has already identified as having no coverage available whatsoever from any admitted insurer in the state.

40|$|This paper uses a {{contingent}} claims framework {{to develop a}} financial pricing model of insurance that overcomes {{one of the main}} shortcomings of previous models [...] the inability to price insurance by line in a multiple <b>line</b> <b>insurer</b> subject to default risk. The model predicts prices will vary across firms depending upon firm default risk, but within a given insurer prices should not vary after controlling for line-specific liability growth rates. We also analyze an important qualification to this result for insurance groups, where several insurer subsidiaries are owned by a primary insurer or holding company. Empirical tests using data on publicly traded property-liability insurers support the hypotheses: prices vary across firms depending upon overall-firm default risk and the concentration of business among subsidiaries; but within a given firm, prices do not vary by line after adjusting for line-specific liability growth rates...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} how rating standards affect firms credit quality. In {{the aftermath}} of hurricane Katrina in 2005, the major rating agencies have changed the rating standards for exposures to catastrophic risks. As a result, insurers with catastrophic risks exposures had to hold more capital to maintain the same rating grade. In this paper we argue that firms’ adjustment to new standards is obtained as a trade off between the benefits {{and the cost of}} maintaining the rating. We demonstrate that new standards produced a heterogeneous effect on the credit quality of insurers and identify two distinct groups of firms. While high credit quality firms focused in commercial lines of insurance have increased the capital, low rated personal <b>lines</b> <b>insurers</b> have accepted the downgrade and reduced the credit quality. The results suggest that the rating standards are significant for the distribution of credit risks in the insurance industry and its ability to sustain catastrophic losses...|$|R
