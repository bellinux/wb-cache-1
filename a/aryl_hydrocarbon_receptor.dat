In addition, SLCO 4 C 1 overexpression decreased plasma levels of the uremic toxins guanidino succinate, asymmetric dimethylarginine, and the newly identified trans-aconitate. We found that xenobiotic responsive element core motifs regulate SLCO 4 C 1 transcription, and various statins, which act as inducers of nuclear <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>receptors,</b> upregulate SLCO 4 C 1 transcription.

25|$|The AhR protein {{contains}} several domains {{critical for}} function and {{is classified as}} a member of the basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim (bHLH/PAS) family of transcription factors. The bHLH motif is located in the N-terminal of the protein and is a common entity in a variety of transcription factors. Members of the bHLH superfamily have two functionally distinctive and highly conserved domains. The first is the basic-region (b), which is involved in the binding of the transcription factor to DNA. The second is the helix-loop-helix (HLH) region, which facilitates protein-protein interactions. Also contained with the AhR are two PAS domains, PAS-A and PAS-B, which are stretches of 200-350 amino acids that exhibit a high sequence homology to the protein domains that were originally found in the Drosophila genes period (Per) and single-minded (Sim) and in AhR’s dimerization partner the <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>receptor</b> nuclear translocator (ARNT). The PAS domains support specific secondary interactions with other PAS domain containing proteins, as is the case with AhR and ARNT, so that dimeric and heteromeric protein complexes can form. The ligand binding site of AhR is contained within the PAS-B domain and contains several conserved residues critical for ligand binding. Finally, a glutamine-rich (Q-rich) domain is located in the C-terminal region of the protein and is involved in co-activator recruitment and transactivation.|$|E

NEDD9 is also induced by the environmental pollutant dioxin, based on regulation through the <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>receptor</b> (AhR). One study has found NEDD9 repressed by estrogen, based on binding of the SAFB1 co-repressor.

2500|$|Induction of CYP1A1 by {{benzopyrene}} occurs via binding to the <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>receptor</b> in the cytosol, {{leading the}} transformed receptor to translocate to the nucleus where it dimerises with <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>receptor</b> nuclear translocator and then binds xenobiotic response elements in DNA located upstream of certain genes.

This process {{is similar to}} induction of CYP1A1 by certain polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins. Seemingly, CYP1A1 activity in the intestinal mucosa prevents major amounts of ingested benzopyrene to enter portal blood and systemic circulation. Intestinal, but not hepatic, expression of CYP1A1 depends on TOLL-like receptor 2 (TLR2), which is a eucaryotic receptor for bacterial surface structures such as lipoteichoic acid.

In the present study, substances contained in sediment organic fractions from the Detroit River were screened {{for their ability to}} bind ER and/or AhR. Two in vitro bioassays were used: MELN cells, consisting of human breast cancer cells (MCF- 7) stably transfected with the luciferase reporter gene, to assess the binding to ER, and cultured fish hepatocytes, PLHC- 1, to measure the AhR-mediated induction of 7 -ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD). Chemical analyses of the sediment extracts were performed to examine relationships with the biological responses. Significant ER- and AhR-activities were mostly found in the most polar fraction (containing mostly PAHs). The five strongest estrogenic extracts were also the most efficient to induce EROD activity. The correlation between PAHs contamination level and biological responses suggests that the most polluted areas contain a mixture of both estrogenic and EROD-inducing compounds or, alternatively, compounds able to bind ER and AhR, such as PAHs, would be responsible for the observed activities...|$|R

TEFs are consensus values and, because of the strong species dependence for toxicity, are listed separately for mammals, fish, and birds. TEFs for mammalian species are generally applicable to human risk calculations. The TEFs have been developed from detailed assessment of literature data to facilitate both risk assessment and regulatory control.

Dietary factors especially enriched in Western diet cause and promote inflammatory processes throughout the organism involving various pathways but mainly the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Cruciferous vegetables contain large amounts of various indole derivatives and are able via these components to activate <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>receptors</b> (AhR). Activation of these intracellular receptors results in potent intestinal immune modulation including regulation and maintenance of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes and innate lymphoid cells, induction of the key barrier cytokine interleukin- 22 and manipulation of the intestinal microbiota. Lack of AhR is associated with an impaired barrier function and increased intestinal vulnerability suggesting that the continuous presence of dietary AhR ligands may be of importance throughout life. Sulforaphane, an isothiocyanate compound of cruciferous vegetables, also exerts mainly anti-inflammatory properties on immune processes. Therefore, evidence is accumulating that certain food components are healthy by targeting intestinal immune responses and reshaping the microbiota.|$|R

While the effect of smoking on the occurrence of lung cancer has been studied extensively, the association between smoking and HIV pathogenesis is poorly studied.

CSC contains PAH, which are known to be activated by CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 B 1 into procarcinogens/toxic metabolites. The expression of these CYPs is regulated by <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>receptors</b> (AHR), the cellular target of PAH, and an important player in various diseases including cancer.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{accepted}} that receptor-mediated action of steroid hormones depends on both the receptor and the hormonal level. The mechanism of transcription by steroid receptors is mediated by cofactors, which function as co-activators or co-repressors, while their non-genomic actions depend on receptors localized to the cell membrane. Recently, a number of environmental chemicals, which are now termed as endocrine disruptors, have been identified, and their unwanted effects on our lives have become serious problems all over the world. Their adverse effects on endocrine systems in animals, mostly estrogenic or anti-estrogenic, have resulted in reproductive malfunction and developmental disorders. Although <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> exhibit estrogenic or anti- estrogenic activity through specific interaction with <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>receptors,</b> other chemicals seem to interact directly with estrogen receptors, α and β forms. In this paper, we surveyed the most recent understanding of endocrine disruptors {{from the viewpoint of}} steroid receptor systems. We suggest two potential mechanisms of action for endocrine disruptors. Endocrine distruptors i) directly associate with steroid receptor systems and/or ii) associate with the growth factor or the neurotransmitter receptor systems, and then upregulate the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascades, leading to the ligand-independent activation of steroid receptor systems. Using these steroid receptor-dependent mechanisms, it appears that endocrine disruptors disorder our endocrine systems. We have proposed future suggestions to further understand endocrine disruptors from the viewpoint of steroid receptor systems.

Binding affinity for the estrogen receptor (ER) of the selected OPFRs appeared limited in ECC- 1 cells, as no profound changes in ER inducible target gene expression were observed. Furthermore, the six selected OPFRs exerted few effects on the <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> receptor-inducible CYP 1 A 1 expression, although at high concentrations TMPP mildly induced gene expression. Messenger RNA and protein accumulation of androgen receptor (AR) target genes were examined for TDCIPP. Additionally, secretory PSA detection, chromatin immunoprecipitation and a ligand binding assay were performed using TDCIPP and the synthetic androgen methyltrienolone. AR inducible target gene and protein expression were significantly altered by TDCIPP exposure, as well as excreted prostate specific antigen. For the first time it was demonstrated that TDCIPP does not have binding affinity for the AR-ligand binding domain and appears to exert its anti-androgenic effects in LNCaP cells in a non-competitive fashion. Furthermore, TDCIPP exposure could adversely influence clinical outcomes for prostate cancer screenings, resulting in false negatives.

In this study, we explored the function of AhR in bone metabolism using AhR(RANKΔOc/ΔOc) (RANK(Cre/+);AhR(flox/flox)) mice. We observed enhanced bone mass together with decreased resorption in both male and female 12 and 24 -week-old AhR(RANKΔOc/ΔOc) mice. Control mice treated with 3 -methylcholanthrene (3 MC), an AhR agonist, exhibited decreased bone mass and increased bone resorption, whereas AhR(CtskΔOc/ΔOc) (Ctsk(Cre/+);AhR(flox/flox)) mice injected with 3 MC appeared to have a normal bone phenotype. In vitro, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from AhR(RANKΔOc/ΔOc) mice exhibited impaired osteoclastogenesis and repressed differentiation with downregulated expression of B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp 1), and cytochrome P 450 genes Cyp 1 b 1 and Cyp 1 a 2. Collectively, our results not only demonstrated that AhR in osteoclast lineage cells is a physiologically relevant regulator of bone resorption, but also highlighted the need for further studies on the skeletal actions of AhR inhibitors in osteoclast lineage cells commonly associated with bone diseases, especially diseases linked to environmental pollutants known to induce bone loss...|$|R

The composition of the microbiota largely determines the levels of tryptophan in the systemic circulation and hence, indirectly, the levels of serotonin in the brain. Some microbiota synthesize neurotransmitters directly, e. g., gamma-amino butyric acid, while modulating the synthesis of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and norepinephrine, and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF).

Dysbiosis leading to reduced levels of SCFAs, notably butyrate, therefore may have adverse effects on epithelial barrier integrity, energy homeostasis, and the T helper 17 /regulatory/T cell balance.

To elucidate the functional characterization of avian AHRs, 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) binding affinities and in vitro DRC-induced transcriptional activities of AHR isoforms from chicken (Gallus gallus), black-footed albatross (Phoebastria nigripes), common cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) and jungle crow (Corvus macrorhynchos) were investigated. All avian AHR isoforms exhibit specific binding affinity to [3 H]TCDD, as assessed by velocity sedimentation. An in vitro reporter gene transactivation assay revealed that AHR 2 s from chicken, albatross and cormorant had reduced transcriptional efficiencies to TCDD {{as compared to}} AHR 1 s from the corresponding species. Particularly, chicken AHR 2 exhibited dramatically reduced transactivation. In contrast, the transcriptional ability of crow AHR 2 was almost {{comparable to that of}} AHR 1. One possible reason accounting for this difference in transactivation may be the structural difference in C-terminal halves. Furthermore, tissue expression profiles of AHR isoform mRNAs in cormorant and crow revealed that AHR 1 s were expressed in most tissues, whereas AHR 2 s were detectable in limited tissues. However, comparison of hepatic mRNA expression levels of two AHR isoforms showed a species difference; AHR 1 is dominant than AHR 2 in cormorant, in contrast to crow, in which AHR 2 is the major form. These results suggest that function of AHR isoforms mediating the response to DRC exposure is diverse even within avian species...|$|R
