50|$|Heavy Water Plant at Baroda is {{the first}} plant set up in India for the {{production}} of heavy water by employing Monothermal <b>Ammonia-Hydrogen</b> <b>exchange</b> process.The <b>plant</b> is located 8 km north from Baroda railway station along the national highway No. 8, adjacent to the Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd. (GSFC).The plant was integrated with GSFC until 1999 when GSFC upgraded their Ammonia plant to an incompatible low pressure system resulting in temporary suspension in the operations of the Heavy Water Plant.|$|R
50|$|This {{facility}} {{also has}} a Potassium metal plant for supply of Potassium metal for preparing catalyst solution for all Monothermal <b>Ammonia-Hydrogen</b> <b>exchange</b> plants.The <b>plant</b> was expanded in 1987 to enhance the production capacity to 52 MT/year and has a capability {{to meet the demands}} of external customers also.This plant is based on Thermal reduction of Potassium Fluoride with Calcium Carbide initially developed by Hoechst A.G.,Werk Griesheim, West Germany.An independent front end was added to produce Ammonia at this time. This plant was commissioned in 1975 with an initial rated capacity of 30 MT/year.The Plant was awarded ISO-9001:2000 on 06.08.2002.|$|R

50|$|Heavy Water Plant at Talcher {{employs the}} <b>ammonia-hydrogen</b> <b>exchange</b> process (Bithermal). The plant {{is located at}} a {{distance}} of 150 km from Bhubaneshwar. The work on this plant in October 1972 and it was commissioned in March 1985. Operation of the plant was suspended in August 1994 due to unsatisfactory operation of the fertilizer plant of the Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited., Talcher. The plant operation was resumed later and an R&D pilot plant has been commissioned for the production of Di-2-ethyl hexyl phosphoric acid (D2EHPA), an effective metal extractant, used for hydro-metallurgical recovery and the separation of various metals. The solvent is useful for concentrating and purifying the valuable metal solutions of low-grade complex ores and is already being used by India's nuclear industry at various commercial operations for the separation and recovery of Zinc, Cobalt, Nickel and Rare Earths.|$|R

2500|$|According to Anna Pavord, Gerard was a doer, not a thinker and a plantsman, not a scholar. Deborah Harkness {{notes that}} Gerard {{was not part}} of the {{community}} of Lime Street naturalists in London at the time. His somewhat flawed (from the perspective of some of his contemporaries) Herball is dedicated to Burghley. He surrounded himself with influential friends and contacts, including Lancelot Browne, George Baker, and the apothecaries James Garrett, Hugh Morgan and Richard Garth. Garret was a Huguenot living and working in London, and a neighbour of L'Obel. Many of these had fine gardens and would <b>exchange</b> <b>plants.</b> Garth, who described Gerard as [...] "a worshipful gentleman and one that greatly delighteth in strange plants" [...] had South American contacts from where he would import rarities. He also <b>exchanged</b> <b>plants</b> with Clusius and cultivated a certain [...] "Captain Nicholas Cleet of the Turky Company" [...] from whom he obtained specimens from the Middle East. He would also visit other collectors and nurserymen such as Richard Pointer of Twickenham, Master Fowle, keeper of the Queen's house at St. James and Master Huggens, keeper of the garden at Hampton Court. His servant, William Marshall travelled to the Mediterranean on his behalf and Jean Robin, the French king's botanist sent him seeds.

40|$|This article explores {{possible}} {{histories of}} <b>plant</b> <b>exchanges</b> and <b>plant</b> naming {{tied to the}} slave trade between East Africa, Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands. The subsequent 'marronnage' of slaves on these islands - their escape from captivity, sometimes to live in mountain hideouts - continues to inspire cultural references. Inspired {{by the use of}} the adjective 'marron/marronne' for a number of plants on Reunion Island, we compile evidence of <b>plant</b> <b>exchanges</b> and <b>plant</b> naming from ecological records, historical accounts and the use of descriptive, emotive or symbolic vernacular names as clues for deepening our knowledge of historical societies and environments. The evidence from the Mascarenes opens a window into the role of the African diaspora in plant introduction, diffusion, domestication and cultivation. We document that maroons relied on a variety of wild, escaped and cultivated plants for their subsistence. We also highlight the role of marronnage in the popular and literary imaginary, with the result that many plants are named 'marron/marrone' in a metaphorical sense. Finally, we identify a few plants that may have been transported, cultivated, or encouraged {{in one way or another}} by maroons. Along the way, we reflect on the pitfalls and opportunities of such interdisciplinary work. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

This study aimed at evaluating the ecophysiological and biochemical responses of saltbush plants at the concentrations of 0 mM, 150 mM, 300 mM, 450 mM and 600 mM of NaCl. Biometry, gas exchange and relative content of chlorophyll and proline in the leaves were measured. Plants presented growth stimulation mainly at the levels of 0 mM, 150 mM and 300 mM of NaCl. Regarding gas <b>exchange,</b> <b>plants</b> showed variation in the photosynthetic rate and stomatal regulation, with a small increase in leaf transpiration. Salinity did not significantly alter the chlorophyll contents, but induced an increase in proline contents in all NaCl levels, demonstrating a growth maintenance capacity and indicating the occurrence of osmotic adjustment...|$|R
