Microflotation performance for <b>algal</b> <b>separation.</b> Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 109 (7), pp. 1663 - 1673, which has been published in final form at [URL] This article {{may be used for}} non-commercial purposes in accordance With Wiley Terms and Conditions for self-archiving'. The performance of microflotation, dispersed air flotation with microbubble clouds with bubble size about 50 [*]µm, for algae separation using fluidic oscillation for microbubble generation is investigated. This fluidic oscillator converts continuous air supply into oscillatory flow with a regular frequency to generate bubbles of the scale of the exit pore. Bubble characterization results showed that average bubble size generated under oscillatory air flow state was 86 [*]µm, approximately twice the size of the diffuser pore size of 38 [*]µm. In contrast, continuous air flow at the same rate through the same diffusers yielded an average bubble size of 1, 059 [*]µm, 28 times larger than the pore size. Following microbubble generation, the separation of algal cells under fluidic oscillator generated microbubbles was investigated by varying metallic coagulant types, concentration and pH. Best performances were recorded at the highest coagulant dose (150 [*]mg/L) applied under acidic conditions (pH 5). Amongst the three metallic coagulants studied, ferric chloride yielded the overall best result of 99. 2 % under the optimum conditions followed closely by ferric sulfate (98. 1 %) and aluminum sulfate with 95. 2 %. This compares well with conventional dissolved air flotation (DAF) benchmarks, but has a highly turbulent flow, whereas microflotation is laminar with several orders of magnitude lower energy density.

40|$|L'objectif de cette étude est de comprendre le fonctionnement épuratoire de l'écosystème particulier que constitue le lagunage à haut rendement (LHR) afin de déterminer les principaux facteurs responsables de l'élimination de l'azote et du phosphore. Sur un bassin de 48 m 2, alimenté eu eaux usées domestiques préalablement traitées pendant une semaine dans un bassin {{primaire}} ont été suivies selon un rythme hebdomadaire les formes carbonées, azotées et phosphorées dis-soutes et particulaires, les variables caractéristiques de l'activité photosynthétiques (chlorophylle a, pH et 02) et les données climatiques (rayonnement solaire et température). Une analyse en composantes principales réalisée sur l'ensemble des résultats a montré, d'une part l'opposition des variables climatiques et photosynthétiques aux formes minérales de l'azote et du phosphore (N-NH 4 et P-PO 4) et d'autre part l'influence de la charge organique sur le fonctionnement du système. L'évolution des formes azotées et phosphorées présente un effet saisonnier marqué. En hiver ou lors de surcharge organique importante, une augmentation du temps de séjour peut améliorer les rendements épuratoires. L'évolution de la matière organique dissoute est indépendante du cycle saisonnier. Au cours des deux années du suivi on observe une adaptation progressive de l'écosystème à la dégradation de la matière organique. Dans le lagunage à haut rendement l'élimination de l'azote et du phosphore est liée principalement à l'activité algale, qui entraîne une assimilation biologique et une élévation du pH, responsables des phénomènes chimiques de volatilisation de l'azote ammoniacal et de précipitation de phosphate de calcium. High rait algal ponds (HRAP) for {{wastewater treatment}} {{have been the}} locus {{of a lot of}} attention since their creation by Professor W. J. OSWALD in the early 1960 ' s. These aquatic ecosystems are hypereutrophic because of massive nutrient introduction with the wastewater influent. This kind of pond is very different from oxidation ponds because al short residence times (2 to 12 days), shallow depths (0. 30 to 0. 60 m) and constant mechanical mixing which improves algal growth. This study has been carried out {{in a small town in}} the department of Herault (France). The objective is to establish the efficiencies and mechanisms for nitrogen and phosphorus remval from secondary domestic wastewater by treatment by HRAP. A high rate algal pond of 48 m 2 surface area and 35 cm depth, constantly mixed with paddle wheels was studied (fig. 1). Residence limes changed from 2 te 12 days with solar radiations and influent loading. The samples were collected once a week from the in- and outflow at 3 p. m. - Dissolved and particulate COD, varions nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, suspended solide, chlorophyll-a, pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature and irradiation were determined. The results of principal component analysis show a negative correlation between (1) the climatic and photosynthetic parameters and (2) inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, as well as the influence of organic loading on the HRAP efficiency. The chronological clustering analysis was performed on the data taking into account the discontinuities of effluent autrient contents (fig. 4). During the first year, from February to September 1988, good climatic conditions were shown to favour photosynthetic activity and consequently a good ammonia and orthophosphate removal. Front September 1988 to February 1989, the effluent was characterized by high ammonia and orthophosphate levels because of unfavourable climatic conditions and low photosynthetic activity. During the second year, the objective was to improve removal efficiencies; the residence time was changed with solar radiations and influent loading. The results of the chronological clustering analysis of ammonia and orthophosphate levels showed only one sequence (February 1989 -January 1990) because the seasonal variations of nutrient removal were attenuated. The optimal residence time was found to be 4 days in summer and 12 days in winter. The evolution of dissolved chemical oxygen demand is independent of seasonal conditions but decreases with the maturity of the system (< 50 mg. l- 1). The mass balance of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds has been established (fig. 5). In high rate algal pond influent, the main nitrogen form is ammonia. In the effluent the main nitrogen form is suspended organic nitrogen. The oxidized forms (NO 2 - et NO 3) present very low levels; nitrification is a minor process in the system. Ammonia is reduced by both assimilation and stripping; suspended organic nitrogen in the effluent is an indicator of assimilation by algal biomass and loss of nitrogen is an indicator of ammonia stripping. With regard to directive 91 / 271 EEC concerning domestic wastewater treatment, partial <b>algal</b> <b>separation</b> is necessary in order to achieve 15 mg • l- 1 total nitrogen, which is the limit for zones sensitive to eutrophication. The residual phosphate levels are controlled by pH, which is responsible for instantaneous calcium phosphate precipitation. As the dissolved calcium concentrations are high in the calcareous region near the site (Ca = 125 mg • l- 1), the pH of the water will be the main contraint on phosphate elimination in the HRAP. Theoretical calculations indicate that the precipitate is probably an amorphous tricalcium phosphate in pseudoequilibrium (fig. 6). Phosphate concentrations are much higher titan the values expected for calcium hydroxyapatite in equilibrium (MOUTIN et al., 1992). The limit of 2 mg • l- 1 for phosphores can only be attained when pH reaches or exceeds 9. Nitrogen and phosphorus removal is correlated mainly with phytoplanktonic activity, which controls biological nutrients assimilation and pH levels. High pH values are responsable for ammonia stripping and calcium phosphate precipitation...|$|E
40|$|Microalgae {{surpass the}} lipid {{productivity}} of terrestrial plants by several folds. However, {{due to the}} high moisture content and rigidity of algal cell walls, extraction of lipids from algae is still a significant technological challenge. In this research, {{an attempt was made}} to develop an <b>algal</b> lipid <b>separation</b> process which is energy efficient and effective. Algal related research requires a unique set of knowledge in areas of algae culturing, measuring cell concentration, harvesting, cell rupturing and lipid quantification. The first section of this thesis focuses {{on the state of the}} art as well as knowledge gained during preliminary studies. The second section of this thesis focuses on selecting a suitable measurement technique for quantification of algal cell disruption induced by homogenization. The selected method, hemocytometry was used to measure the degree of algal cell disruption induced by homogenization. In the third section, various homogenization treatments were evaluated for determining the fraction of cells disrupted during the homogenization. Finally, lipid extraction efficiency of homogenized algae was evaluated using different extraction solvents under different homogenization conditions. Preliminary research concluded that using cell counting is the most suitable technique to measure the effect of high pressure homogenization on concentrated microalgae. It was observed that higher pressure and increased number of passes increase the degree of cell disruption. Concentrated, non stressed samples show best response to homogenization. Out of the three solvents used for solvent extraction, chloroform gave a higher extraction yield at low intensity homogenizations. However at harsher homogenization levels the advantage of chloroform was not significant. Lipid extraction efficiency increases with increased levels of homogenization. However, a significant increase in lipid yields was not detected beyond 20 000 psi and 2 passes of homogenization treatment...|$|R
40|$|Saline {{deterioration}} in the South African public water system has been documented and disposal of brine wastes {{has been identified as}} part of the problem. The broad aim of this research programme was to undertake an initial technical study to evaluate the feasibility of integrating algal biotechnology into a disposal function for these wastes. A demonstration of utility in the form of products and waste treatment could produce a beneficiation of saline effluents and provide incentives necessary to deal with the disposal issue. The study attempted to demonstrate a synthesis between the two main thrusts in algal biotechnology that have produced large-scale practical applications - stable, predictable algal production in saline media and the cost effective High Rate Oxidation Ponding (HROP) process for incorporating algal production into a waste treatment function. Tannery organic saline effluents and the biotechnology of Dunaliella salina culture producing β- carotene were chosen as paradigms for the study. 1. The alga was shown to grow in certain tannery effluents producing enhanced biomass yields compared to defined inorganic medium cultivation. The potential for amino acid or protein supplementation of defmed culture media was noted. 2. A reduction in organic load simultaneous with the growth of D. salina was recorded in laboratory-scale simulations of the HROP process. Rates similar to the fresh water HROP equivalent were demonstrated. 3. These results suggested the uptake and storage of organic nitrogen by D. salina. The consequent inhibition of β-carotene accumulation by the organism presented a potentially insurmountable obstacle to the feasibility of β-carotene production in this medium. Uptake and release of organic compounds, previously demonstrated in phytoplankton and other micro-algae, was confirmed in this study for D. salina. The evidence acquired indicated the internalization of both glycine and bovine serum albumin. An ultrastructural study demonstrated mechanisms by which this process might occur. 4. The release of substantial quantities of glycerol was shown. A mechanism whereby D. salina may use this to regulate ammonia availability via control of its associated bacterial population was observed. Glycerol release was identified as presenting an application in treating refractory organic wastes, such as secondary sewage sludges, by elevating C:N ratios. This could demonstrate a significant utility for brine waste impoundments. 5. A multistage production process was proposed {{to deal with the problem}} of β-carotene inhibition by separation of the growth and metabolite accumulation functions into separate unit operations. It was shown in this study that the stress of nitrogen deficiency combined with high salinity provides for effectiveβ-carotene accumulation under the conditions of low illumination that pertain in dense cultures. Subjected to these conditions effluent-grown cells show delayed but unimpaired {j-carotene accumulation. 6. A role for the plant hormone abscisic acid in mediating the stress response was demonstrated in D. salina. Fluorescence induction studies suggested the presence of a signalling process forming part of a sensitivity control mechanism. Stress induction of β-carotene accumulation could occur through four clearly defined stages. Potential was identified for using this response as a physiological probe for monitoring and regulating the stress induction process. 7. The multistage processing concept requires effective <b>algal</b> cell <b>separation</b> technology. The use of cross-flow ultrafiltration and diafiltration with a polyethersulfone tubular membrane system was demonstrated as an effective process for the recovery and washing of D. salina. Cell concentrates were produced in a viable form. 8. Process designs incorporating the findings of the research programme are presented demonstrating how effluent and organic waste treatment functions may be combined with the production of D. salina and its products. Application of the multi-stage processing concept to β-carotene production in a defined medium process was identified as offering a potential four-fold yield enhancement. This could have a significant impact on a high cost, marginal algal biotechnology process. Aspects of novelty have been claimed in provisional patents applications. A provisional demonstration of the feasibility of D. salina production in tannery effluent indicates that algal biotechnology may provide a utility for, and hence the beneficiation of saline effluent wastes...|$|R
