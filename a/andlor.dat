40|$|The {{following}} experiments {{examined the}} ability of delta- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to attenuate lithium induced sickness in both the nonemetic rat (Rattus norvegicus) and the emetic house musk shrew (Suncus murinus). The ability of THC to attenuate the expression of previously established lithium induced conditioned sickness behavior in Suncus was also examined. Although unconditioned sickness behavior was displayed by both rats and shrews, THC did not attenuate this behavior in either species.

40|$|In 54 healthy {{individuals}} and 107 patients with coronary artery disease, intraventricular early filling velocities were recorded by colour M-mode Doppler. The time {{difference between the}} occurrence of peak velocity in the apical region and at the mitral tip was calculated, and normalized by dividing it by the mitral to apical distance. Transmitral velocities were determined by the single pulsed Doppler technique. The patients were divided into groups according to systolic function as assessed by left ventriculography. The normalized time difference was similar in the reference group (12 ± 8 ms. cm~') and the patient group with no electrocardiographical signs of previous infarction and normal ventriculography (16 ± 16 ms. cm~'). It increased significantly in the group with infarction <b>andlor</b> regional systolic dysfunction (43 ± 21 ms. cm~'), and a further increase was present in the group with severely impaired ventricles (53 ± 14 ms. cm~').

40|$|The first {{objective}} of the thesis was to reveal the characteristic magnetic behaviour of natural weakly magnetic minerals (such as hematite and chromite), and the size limits of the particles recoverable by the existing modem high intensity and high gradient magnetic separators. The second objective was to enhance the particle aggregation <b>andlor</b> the magnetic response for wet magnetic concentration of the ultrafines which escaped from the separators. It was observed that weakly magnetic natural minerals (hematite and chromite) exhibited variations in the magnetic behaviour with respect to magnetizing field, temperature and even particle size, It was indicated that high gradient magnetic separation with industrial matrices was efficient for weakly magnetic minerals as small as 10 um, but below this size, poor separation efficiency was obtained. In this thesis, modifications to the existing magnetic technology or alternative methods were investigated for the efficient recovery of particles below 10 gm. The technology or methods included "carrier" or "piggy-back" method, aggregation with magnetic bonding (with permanent or fieldinduced magnetic moment), and hydrophobic magnetite seeding. The thesis discusses the theoretical aspects {{of the problem and}} the experimental work.
