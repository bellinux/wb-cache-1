Differences {{were found in the}} virulence of the three passages called virulent, intermediate, and avirulent. <b>Avirulent</b> <b>virus</b> was derived by attenuation of virulent virus in cell culture and intermediate virus was derived by passage of <b>avirulent</b> <b>virus</b> in a pig. Nucleotide sequence differences between virulent and <b>avirulent</b> <b>virus</b> consisted of 50 nucleotide changes and a three-nucleotide deletion, and between avirulent and intermediate virus consisted of 8 nucleotide changes resulting in six amino acid changes. Three of these amino acid changes were direct reversions to virulent virus. Genetic changes, especially those seemingly associated with attenuation followed by some degree of reversion to virulence, in ORF 1 a, ORF 1 b, and ORF 6 regions of the genome may be involved in the control of PRRSV replication and virulence...|$|E

Most infected equid eventually bring the virus under immunological control. We recently reported {{the development of}} an equine-specific ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) to quantitate mRNA levels of 10 cytokines. Using this newly developed RPA, we now show significant differences in cytokine induction in equine monocyte-derived macrophages (EMDM) exposed to virulent and avirulent EIAV. Virulent EIAV 17 induced significant increases in interleukin (IL) - 1 α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α by 0. 5 – 1 h postinfection (hpi).

40|$|AbstractThe {{emergence}} of resistance breaking (RB) variants {{starting from the}} avirulent Potato virus Y NN strain (PVYNN) was analyzed after imposing different selective host constraints. Tobacco resistance to PVYNN is conferred by va in both NC 745 and VAM genotypes, but VAM carries an extra resistance gene, va 2. RB-variants emerged only in NC 745 and unexpectedly accumulated higher in the original host, tobacco B 21, than the parental PVYNN. However, the recovery of RB-variants was interfered by PVYNN in mixed infections. Further analysis indicated that RB-variants also arose in tobacco VAM, but they were limited to subliminal local infections. Their inability to breakout was associated with absence of a mutational adaptation in the viral VPg gene, which implied a loss of fitness in tobacco B 21. Altogether, the {{emergence of}} RB-variants was conditioned by inherited host constraints, interference by co-infecting <b>avirulent</b> <b>virus</b> genotypes, and fitness tradeoff of virus adaptations...|$|E

To {{gain insight into}} the mechanism for thisevent, we sought to identify the molecular changes in virulent mutants that occur during replication in 14 -day-old embryonated chicken eggs. After three passages in 14 -day-old eggs, <b>avirulent</b> H 5 <b>viruses</b> with the K/R-K-K/T-R sequence at the hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site became virulent in chickens, concomitantly acquiring high HA cleavability, whereas those with the R-E-T-R sequence did not. None of the test viruses converted to a virulent phenotype when passaged in 10 -day-old eggs. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that the virulent mutants either lost a glycosylation site near the HA cleavage site or acquired an additional arginine at the latter. <b>Avirulent</b> <b>viruses</b> that became virulent after passage in older eggs included an H 5 N 2 avian strain with the R-K-T-R sequence that was isolated in 1993, indicating that viruses with this sequence motif, which are currently circulating in bird populations, should be considered potentially virulent.

It {{is still unclear}} whether NDVs circulating among wild waterfowl also {{have the potential to}} become highly pathogenic (velogenic) in chickens. To demonstrate experimentally the generation of velogenic NDV from a nonpathogenic waterfowl isolate, we passaged an avirulent goose isolate in chickens. After nine consecutive passages by air-sac inoculation, followed by five passages in chick brain, the virus became highly virulent in chickens, producing a 100 % mortality rate, and demonstrating typical velogenic properties in pathogenicity tests. Sequence analysis at the fusion protein cleavage site showed that the original isolate contained the typical avirulent type sequence, E-R-Q-E-R/L, which progressed incrementally to a typical virulent type, K-R-Q-K-R/F, during repeated passage in chickens. These results demonstrate that <b>avirulent</b> <b>viruses,</b> maintained in wild waterfowl in nature and bearing the consensus avirulent type sequence, have the potential to become velogenic after transmission to and circulation in chicken populations.

40|$|A reverse {{transcriptase}} PCR (RT-PCR) {{was used for}} rapid determination of the hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site sequence, a marker for the virulence potential of avian influenza viruses. When applied to specimens from chickens experimentally infected with either a virulent or an <b>avirulent</b> <b>virus,</b> RT-PCR uni-formly detected the HA gene, even in specimens that were negative for virus by standard testing in eggs. This technique, combined with sequencing of the HA cleavage site, offers a rapid and sensitive way to assess the virulence potential of avian influenza viruses. Early detection of field isolates with virulence-associated structural motifs at the HA cleavage site would allow better control of influenza among large poultry popu-lations. Some strains of avian influenza A virus are lethal to poultry, while others are nonlethal. The latter, including a majority of field isolates, replicate only in the respiratory and intestinal organs, resulting in mild or asymptomatic disease with low mortality rates.

40|$|Highly virulent avian {{influenza}} viruses can arise from avirulent strains maintained in poultry, but {{evidence to support}} their generation from viruses in wild birds is lacking. The most likely mechanism for the acquisition of virulence by benign avian viruses is the introduction of mutations by error-prone RNA polymerase, followed by the selection of virulent viruses. To investigate whether this mechanism could apply to wild waterfowl, we studied an avirulent wild-swan virus that replicates poorly in chickens. After 24 consecutive passages by air sac inoculation, followed by five passages in chicken brain, the <b>avirulent</b> <b>virus</b> became highly pathogenic in chickens, producing a 100 % mortality rate.

40|$|SummaryThe {{emergence}} {{of infectious diseases}} with a broad host range can have a dramatic impact on entire communities and {{has become one of}} the main threats to biodiversity [1 – 4]. Here, we report the simultaneous exploitation of entire communities of potential hosts with associated severe declines following invasion by a novel viral pathogen. We found two phylogenetically related, highly virulent viruses (genus Ranavirus, family Iridoviridae) causing mass mortality in multiple, diverse amphibian hosts in northern Spain, as well as a third, relatively <b>avirulent</b> <b>virus.</b> We document host declines in multiple species at multiple sites in the region. Our work reveals a group of pathogens that seem to have preexisting capacity to infect and evade immunity in multiple diverse and novel hosts, and that are exerting massive impacts on host communities.

40|$|AbstractBiologic {{activity}} of equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) surface (SU) glycoprotein was assayed in a mouse model. Recombinant SU from virulent EIAV 17 (SU 17), administered intraperitoneally to mouse pups, induced dose-dependent diarrheal responses {{similar to those}} reported for SIV SU (Virology 277 (2000) 250). SU 17 caused fluid accumulation without histological lesions in mouse intestinal loops, induced chloride secretory currents in Ussing chambers and increased inositol 1, 4, 5 triphosphate (IP 3) levels in HT 29 cells. An SU 17 peptide, SU 17 (299 – 330), provoked a dose-dependent diarrheal response akin to enterotoxic peptides from SIV. In contrast, SU from an avirulent EIAV strain failed to induce a dose response in mouse pups and produced lower levels of activity than SU 17 in Ussing chambers and IP 3 assays. These results demonstrate that a mouse pup model is useful to monitor EIAV SU biologic activity, showing clear differences between the activities of SU derived from virulent and <b>avirulent</b> <b>viruses,</b> and may provide a useful screen of EIAV virulence...|$|R

40|$|Major {{virulence}} {{determinants of}} Semliki Forest virus (SFV) lie within the non-structural genes {{that form the}} replicase complex proteins. Gene exchange between virulent and <b>avirulent</b> <b>viruses</b> {{has shown that the}} nsP 3 gene, which has essential 59 conserved domains and a non-essential hypervariable 39 domain, is one of the virulence determinants. This protein plays a role in subgenomic 26 S and negative-strand RNA synthesis and is thought to function with nsP 1 to anchor replication complexes to cell membrane structures. Studies to date have focused on analysing the effect of mutational changes spread over the whole gene on virulence of the virus. The virulent SFV 4 virus, derived from an infectious clone, was utilized to analyse the effect on virulence of large deletions in the hypervariable domain of nsP 3. Two viruses with different in-frame deletions that spanned this domain showed reduced rates of RNA synthesis and multiplication in cell culture. In adult BALB/c mice, these <b>viruses</b> were <b>avirulent</b> after intramuscular and intraperitoneal inoculation, and brains sampled from infected mice showed minimal or no evidence of pathology. These deleted viruses had greatly reduced virulence when administered by the intranasal route and brains from infected mice showed lesions that were much less severe than those seen in SFV 4 infection. Mice surviving infection with the deleted viruses resisted challenge with the virulent L 10 strain, indicating induction of protective immunity. This work establishes that deletions in the nsP 3 hypervariable domain attenuate virulence after peripheral inoculation and also reduce virulence after intranasal inoculation...|$|R
40|$|The {{nutritional}} {{status of the}} host has long been associated with both severity and suscep-tibility to infectious disease. The accepted model system proposes that inadequate nutrition impairs {{the functioning of the}} immune system, thus resulting in increased susceptibility to infection. However, current work suggests that not only can the {{nutritional status}} of the host affect the immune response, but it can also affect the viral pathogen. In a mouse model, a benign strain of coxsackievirus B 3 became virulent and caused myocarditis in selenium- and vitamin E±de®cient mice. This change in pathogenicity was due to mutations in the viral genome, which changed an <b>avirulent</b> <b>virus</b> into a virulent one. Once these mutations occurred, even mice with normal nutriture developed disease from the mutated virus. These results suggest that the oxidative stress status of the host can have a profound in¯uence on a viral pathogen. Studies of the interaction between infectious disease and host nutritional status have generally shown that poor host nutrition leads to increased pathogenicity of the infecting agent.

40|$|In April 1983, an {{influenza}} virus of low virulence appeared in chickens in Pennsylvania. Subsequently, in October 1983, the virus became virulent and caused high mortality in poultry. The causative agent {{has been identified}} as an {{influenza virus}} of the H 5 N 2 serotype. The hemagglutinin is antigenically closely related to tern/South Africa/ 61 (H 5 N 3) and the neuraminidase is similar to that from human H 2 N 2 strains (e. g., A/Japan/ 305 / 57) and from some avian influenza virus strains (e. g., A/turkey/Mass/ 66 [H 6 N 2]). Comparison of the genome RNAs of chicken/Penn with other influenza virus isolates by RNA-RNA hybridization indicated that all of the genes of this virus were closely related to those of various other influenza virus isolates from wild birds. Chickens infected with the virulent strain shed high concentrations of virus in their feces (10 (7) 50 % egg infective dose per g), and the virus was isolated from the albumin and yolk of eggs layed just before death. Virus was also isolated from house flies in chicken houses. Serological and virological studies showed that humans are not susceptible to infection with the virus, but can serve as short-term mechanical carriers. Analysis of the RNA of the viruses isolated in April and October by gel migration and RNA-RNA hybridization suggested that these strains were very closely related. Oligonucleotide mapping of the individual genes of virulent and avirulent strains showed a limited number of changes in the genome RNAs, but no consistent differences between the virulent and avirulent strains that could be correlated with pathogenicity were found. Polyacrylamide gel analysis of the early (avirulent) isolates demonstrated the presence of low-molecular-weight RNA bands which is indicative of defective-interfering particles. These RNAs were not present in the virulent isolates. Experimental infection of chickens with mixtures of the avirulent and virulent strains demonstrated that the <b>avirulent</b> <b>virus</b> interferes with the pathogenicity of the virulent virus. The results suggest that the original <b>avirulent</b> <b>virus</b> was probably derived from influenza viruses from wild birds and that the virulent strain was derived from the avirulent strain by selective adaptation rather than by recombination or the introduction of a new virus into the population. This adaptation may have involved the loss of defective RNAs, as well as mutations, and thus provides a possible model for a role of defective-interfering particles in nature...|$|E
40|$|Millions of {{domestic}} and wild European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) have died in Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand during the past 17 years following infection by Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV). This highly contagious and deadly disease was first identified in China in 1984. Epidemics of RHDV then radiated across Europe until the virus apparently appeared in Britain in 1992. However, this concept of radiation {{of a new and}} virulent virus from China is not entirely consistent with serological and molecular evidence. This study shows, using RT–PCR and nucleotide sequencing of RNA obtained from the serum of healthy rabbits stored at 4 °C for nearly 50 years, that, contrary to previous opinions, RHDV circulated as an apparently <b>avirulent</b> <b>virus</b> throughout Britain more than 50 years ago and more than 30 years before the disease itself was identified. Based on molecular phylogenetic analysis of British and European RHDV sequences, it is concluded that RHDV has almost certainly circulated harmlessly in Britain and Europe for centuries rather than decades. Moreover, analysis of partial capsid sequences did not reveal significant differences between RHDV isolates that came from either healthy rabbits or animals tha...|$|E
40|$|Several arenaviruses {{can cause}} hemorrhagic fever {{diseases}} (VHFs) in humans, the pathogenic mechanism {{of which is}} poorly understood due to their virulent nature {{and the lack of}} molecular clones. A safe, convenient, and economical small animal model of arenavirus hemorrhagic fever is based on guinea pigs infected by the arenavirus Pichinde (PICV). PICV does not cause disease in humans, but an adapted strain of PICV (P 18) causes a disease in guinea pigs that mimics arenavirus hemorrhagic fever in humans in many aspects, while a low-passaged strain (P 2) remains avirulent in infected animals. In order to identify the virulence determinants within the PICV genome, we developed the molecular clones for both the avirulent P 2 and virulent P 18 viruses. Recombinant viruses were generated by transfecting plasmids that contain the antigenomic L and S RNA segments of PICV {{under the control of the}} T 7 promoter into BSRT 7 - 5 cells, which constitutively express T 7 RNA polymerase. By analyzing viral growth kinetics in vitro and virulence in vivo, we show that the recombinant viruses accurately recapitulate the replication and virulence natures of their respective parental viruses. Both parental and recombinant virulent viruses led to high levels of viremia and titers in different organs of the infected animals, whereas the <b>avirulent</b> <b>viruses</b> were effectively controlled and cleared by the hosts. These novel infectious clones for the PICV provide essential tools to identify the virulence factors that are responsible for the severe VHF-like disease in infected animals...|$|R

40|$|During {{the acute}} {{phase of the}} viral hemorrhagic disease, {{classical}} swine fever (CSF), a severe hematologic depletion in primary lymphoid organs and depletion of peripheral blood T and B lymphocytes are observed. The onset of these pathologic events is before viremia and independent of leukocyte infection, indicating a host-mediated effect possibly through a cytokine storm. Here, we show that high serum levels of interferon- ¿ (IFN-¿) were found during this phase of CSF, detectable as early as 2 days postinfection and reaching maximum levels 3 ¿ 5 days postinfection (250 ¿ 1300 U/mL). This IFN-¿ response {{was related to the}} virulence of the viral strain used, with <b>avirulent</b> <b>virus</b> not inducing any detectable serum IFN-¿. A progressive depletion of natural IFN-producing cells/plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), the likely in vivo source of IFN-¿, was also induced by the viral infection. An important finding was that the onset of severe lymphopenia was concomitant with the IFN-¿ responses, and all animals with serum IFN-¿ had depleted B and T lymphocytes. A statistically significant correlation between lymphocyte depletion and serum IFN-¿ indicates a relationship between the two events, which is supported by the known hematologic effects of high IFN-¿ doses in viv...|$|E
40|$|Identification of {{virulence}} {{determinants of}} viruses is {{of critical importance}} in virology. In search of such determinants, virologists traditionally utilize comparative genomics between a virulent and an <b>avirulent</b> <b>virus</b> strain and construct chimeras to map their locations.

In {{the absence of a}} naturally occurring virulent strain, an avirulent strain can be functionally converted to a virulent variant via an experimental evolutionary approach. However, the concern remains whether experimentally evolved virulence determinants mimic those that have evolved naturally. To provide a direct comparison, we exploited a plant RNA virus, soybean mosaic virus (SMV), and its natural host, soybean. Through a serial in vivo passage experiment, the molecularly cloned genome of an avirulent SMV strain was converted to virulent variants on functionally immune soybean genotypes harboring resistance factor(s) from the complex Rsv 1 locus. Several of the experimentally evolved virulence determinants were identical to those discovered through a comparative genomic approach with a naturally evolved virulent strain.

40|$|A {{number of}} field {{isolates}} of reovirus 3 were examined {{to determine their}} relative neurovirulence after intracerebral inoculation. One isolate was found that had decreased neurovirulence. This "avirulent" strain showed the typical type 3 neural tropism but grew significantly less well in brain tissue than T 3 (Dearing) and the other type 3 reoviruses. The <b>avirulent</b> <b>virus</b> was not temperature-sensitive, and its yield in mouse L cells in vitro {{was similar to that}} of the laboratory strains. To determine the reason that this clone was avirulent, we isolated a series of reassortant progeny clones from crosses between the avirulent strain and T 1 (Lang) and T 3 (Dearing). Using these reassortants, we showed that avirulence was a property of the M 2 gene segment. The M 2 segment was also responsible for conferring greater sensitivity to chymotryptic digestion on the avirulent strain, compared to more virulent strains. Prior studies have determined that the localization of virus in different cell types in the brain (tropism) is a property of the viral hemagglutinin, the product of the S 1 RNA genome segment. Our studies thus indicate that the basis for relative neurovirulence does not reside in the viral hemagglutinin and clearly illustrate the multigenic nature of neurovirulence...|$|E
40|$|Two bovine rotaviruses, C 3 - 160 and 17 / 4, which multiplied in calves without {{inducing}} disease, {{were studied}} {{for their ability}} to protect against disease caused by a virulent rotavirus, CP- 1. Rotavirus 17 / 4 and the virulent virus CP- 1 cross-neutralized poorly and, on the basis of 20 -fold differences in neutralization titres, belonged to different serotypes. Rotaviruses C 3 - 160 and CP- 1 were more closely related: neutralization of the CP- 1 virus by C 3 - 160 antisera was within 20 -fold of the homologous titre although neutralization fthe C 3 - 160 virus by CP- 1 antisera was not. Nine gnotobiotic calves infected with either C 3 - 160 or 17 / 4, had rotavirus antibody in their faeces and/or serum 21 days after oral inoculation as detected by indirect immunofluorescence and IgG, IgM and/or IgA antibodies by ELISA. As expected from the antigenic relationships between the viruses, the sera and faeces from the four calves infected with C 3 - 160 contained moderate l vels of neutralizing antibody to the virulent virus CP- 1 and the sera and most of the faeces from the five calves infected with 17 / 4 contained undetectable or low levels. When challenged with CP- 1 on day 21, four age-matched controls developed isease whereas all of four calves previously infected with C 3 - 160 and four of five calves previously infected with 17 / 4 were protected from disease.

40|$|The {{pandemic}} {{threat posed}} by highly pathogenic H 5 N 1 influenza A viruses has created an urgent need for vaccines to protect against H 5 virus infection. Because pathogenic viruses grow poorly in chicken eggs and their virulence poses a biohazard to vaccine producers, <b>avirulent</b> <b>viruses</b> produced by reverse genetics have become the preferred basis for vaccine production. Here, we investigated two key characteristics of potential H 5 vaccine candidates: the hemaggutinin (HA) cleavage site sequence and its modification to attenuate virulence and the choice of background virus to provide a high-growth rate. We produced recombinant (6 : 2 reassortant) viruses that possessed a series of modified avirulent-type HA and neuraminidase genes, {{both of which were}} derived from an H 5 N 1 human isolate. The other genes of these recombinant viruses were derived from donor virus strains known to grow well in eggs: the human strain A/Puerto Rico/ 8 / 34 (PR 8) or an avian strain. All of the recombinant viruses grew well in eggs, were avirulent in chicks, and protected animals against infection with a wild-type virus. However, one of the recombinant viruses with an avian virus background acquired a mutation in the HA cleavage site sequence that conferred virulence potential to this virus. Moreover, vaccine candidates with the avian virus background were more virulent than those with the human virus background. We conclude that 6 : 2 recombinant viruses with a PR 8 background are more suitable than those with an avian virus background for vaccine development and that the HA cleavage site sequence must be modified to minimize the potential for a vaccine virus to convert to a virulent form. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|AbstractSendai virus V {{protein is}} not {{essential}} for virus replication in cultured cells but is essential for efficient virus replication and pathogenesis in mice, indicating that the V protein has a luxury function to facilitate virus propagation in mice. This was discovered in the Z strain, an egg-adapted avirulent laboratory strain. In the present study, we reexamined the function of Sendai virus V protein by generating a V-knockout Sendai virus derived from the Hamamatsu strain, a virulent field isolate, which is an appropriate model for studying the natural course of Sendai virus infection in mice. We unexpectedly found that the V-knockout virus propagated efficiently in mice and was as virulent as the wild-type virus. Switching of the functionally important V unique region demonstrated that this region of the Hamamatsu strain was also functional in a Z strain background. It thus appears that the V protein is nonsense in a field isolate of Sendai virus. However, the V protein was required for virus growth and pathogenesis of the Hamamatsu strain in mice when the virulence of the virus was attenuated by introducing mutations that {{had been found in}} an egg-adapted, <b>avirulent</b> <b>virus.</b> The V protein therefore seems to be potentially functional in the highly virulent Hamamatsu strain and to be prominent if virus replication is restricted...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{basis for}} {{virulence}} in influenza virus is largely unknown. To explore the mutational basis for increased virulence in the lung, the H 3 N 2 prototype clinical isolate, A/HK/ 1 / 68, was {{adapted to the}} mouse. Genomic sequencing provided the first demonstration, to our knowledge, {{that a group of}} 11 mutations can convert an <b>avirulent</b> <b>virus</b> to a virulent variant that can kill at a minimal dose. Thirteen of the 14 amino acid substitutions (93 %) detected among clonal isolates were likely instrumental in adaptation because of their positive selection, location in functional regions, and/or independent occurrence in other virulent influenza viruses. Mutations in virulent variants repeatedly involved nuclear localization signals and sites of protein and RNA interaction, implicating them as novel modulators of virulence. Mouse-adapted variants with the same hemagglutinin mutations possessed different pH optima of fusion, indicating that fusion activity of hemagglutinin can be modulated by other viral genes. Experimental adaptation resulted in the selection of three mutations that were in common with the virulent human H 5 N 1 isolate A/HK/ 156 / 97 and that may be instrumental in its extreme virulence. Analysis of viral adaptation by serial passage appears to provide the identification of biologically relevant mutations...|$|E
40|$|Viral {{infections in}} {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) can lead to {{neurological}} disease either directly by infection of neurons or indirectly through activation of glial cells and production of neurotoxic molecules. Understanding the effects of virus-mediated insults on neuronal responses and neurotrophic support is important in elucidating the underlying mechanisms of viral diseases of the CNS. In the current study, we examined the expression of neurotrophin- and neurotransmitter-related genes during infection of mice with neurovirulent polytropic retrovirus. In this model, virus-induced neuropathogenesis is indirect, as the virus predominantly infects macrophages and microglia and does not productively infect neurons or astrocytes. Virus infection is associated with glial cell activation and the production of proinflammatory cytokines in the CNS. In the current study, we identified increased expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY), a pleiotropic growth factor which can regulate both immune cells and neuronal cells, as a correlate with neurovirulent virus infection. Increased levels of Npy mRNA were consistently associated with neurological disease in multiple strains of mice and were induced only by neurovirulent, not <b>avirulent,</b> <b>virus</b> infection. NPY protein expression was primarily detected in neurons near areas of virus-infected cells.

Such alerts are rare; however, on Feb 19, 2003, a pandemic alert was issued in {{response to}} human infections caused by an avian H 5 N 1 influenza virus, A/Hong Kong/ 213 / 03. H 5 N 1 had been noted once before in human beings in 1997 and killed a third (6 / 18) of infected people. 1, 2 The 2003 variant seemed to have been transmitted directly from birds to human beings and caused fatal pneumonia in one of two infected individuals. Candidate vaccines were sought, but no <b>avirulent</b> <b>viruses</b> antigenically similar to the pathogen were available, and the isolate killed embryonated chicken eggs. Since traditional strategies of vaccine production were not viable, we sought to produce a candidate reference virus using reverse genetics. Methods We removed the polybasic aminoacids that are associated with high virulence from the haemagglutinin cleavage site of A/Hong Kong/ 213 / 03 using influenza reverse genetics techniques. A reference vaccine virus was then produced on an A/Puerto Rico/ 8 / 34 (PR 8) backbone on WHO-approved Vero cells. We assessed this reference virus for pathogenicity in in-vivo and in-vitro assays. Findings A reference vaccine virus was produced in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) -grade facilities in less than 4 weeks from the time of virus isolation. This virus proved to be non-pathogenic in chickens and ferrets and was shown to be stable after multiple passages in embryonated chicken eggs. Interpretation The ability to produce a candidate reference virus in such {{a short period of time}} sets a new standard for rapid response to emerging infectious disease threats and clearly shows the usefulness of reverse genetics for influenza vaccine development. The same technologies and procedures are currently being used to create reference vaccine viruses against the 2004 H 5 N 1 viruses circulating in Asia. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{state of}} {{pregnancy}} {{was associated with}} a marked enhancement of both proliferative and cytotoxic T cell antiviral immune responses after infection of mice with <b>avirulent</b> Semliki Forest <b>virus.</b> Strong responses were obtained from the spleen and the para-aortic lymph nodes that drain the uterus. This immune enhancement seemed to be in response to the increased antigenic challenge that originated from infected placental and fetal tissue and was released during the process of abortion. Immune enhancement was not observed in pregnant mice similarly infected with Ross River virus, which also established an intrauterine infection but does not cause abortion...|$|R
40|$|FrCasE is a mouse {{retrovirus}} {{that causes}} a fatal noninflammatory spongiform neurodegenerative disease with pathological features strikingly {{similar to those}} induced by transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) agents. Neurovirulence {{is determined by the}} sequence of the viral envelope protein, though the specific role of this protein in disease pathogenesis is not known. In the present study, we compared host gene expression in the brain stems of mice infected with either FrCasE or the <b>avirulent</b> <b>virus</b> F 43, differing from FrCasE in the sequence of the envelope gene. Four of the 12 disease-specific transcripts up-regulated during the preclinical period represent responses linked to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Among these genes was CHOP/GADD 153, which is induced in response to conditions that perturb endoplasmic reticulum function. In vitro studies with NIH 3 T 3 cells revealed up-regulation of CHOP as well as BiP, calreticulin, and Grp 58 /ERp 57 in cells infected with FrCasE but not with F 43. Immunoblot analysis of infected NIH 3 T 3 cells demonstrated the accumulation of uncleaved envelope precursor protein in FrCasE- but not F 43 -infected cells, consistent with ER retention. These results suggest that retrovirus-induced spongiform neurodegeneration represents a protein-folding disease and thus may provide a useful tool for exploring the causal link between protein misfolding and the cytopathology that it causes...|$|E
40|$|Two {{strains of}} Venezuelan {{encephalitis}} virus that are avirulent for normal BALB/c mice inoculated subcutaneously were also avirulent for infected congenitally athymic (nude) mice {{of the same}} strain. Viremias were of similar magnitudes and durations in normal and nude mice. Brain concentrations were higher in nude mice with the one avirulent strain tested, although the periods of detectable virus in brains were similar. No lesions were found in brains, spleens, or lymph nodes by ordinary histopathological examination. Viral neutralizing antibody titers in plasmas at 1 to 3 weeks after infection were lower and more transient in nude than in normal mice, and implantations of thymic tissues into nude mice partially restored their neutralizing antibody responses. Concentrations of spleen cells producing antibodies that lysed sheep erythrocytes 4 days after inoculation of erythrocytes and <b>avirulent</b> <b>virus</b> into nude mice were above the levels of uninfected nude mice. These concentrations were similar in infected and uninfected normal mice. In contrast, two mouse-virulent strains of Venezuelan encephalitis virus killed nude mice faster than normal mice after subcutaneous inoculation. Yet concentrations and durations of virus in bloods and brains were not consistently different between nude and normal mice. There were perivascular monocytes in brains and slight architectural alterations of spleens and lymph nodes. Concentrations of spleen cells producing antibodies hemolytic for sheep erythrocytes 4 days after inoculation with erythrocytes were depressed in nude and normal mice by infection with virulent strains...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn October of 1993, {{there was}} {{decreased}} egg production and increased mortality among Mexican chickens, {{in association with}} serologic evidence of an H 5 N 2 influenza virus. First isolated from chickens in May of 1994, after spreading widely in the country, the virus caused only a mild respiratory syndrome in specific pathogen-free chickens. Because eradication of the virus by destruction of infected birds posed major obstacles to the poultry industry in Mexico, {{we were able to}} conduct a "field experiment" to determine the fate of an <b>avirulent</b> <b>virus</b> after repeated cycles of replication in millions of chickens. By the end of 1994, the virus had mutated to contain a highly cleavable hemagglutinin (HA), but remained only mildly pathogenic in chickens. Within months, however, it had become lethal in poultry. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the HA cleavage site of the original avirulent strain revealed R-E-T-R, typical of avirulent viruses and unlike the K-K-K-R sequence characterizing viruses responsible for the 1983 outbreak in poultry in the United States. Both mildly and highly pathogenic isolates contained insertions and a substitution of basic residues in the HA connecting peptide, R-K-R-K-T-R, which made the HA highly cleavable in trypsin-free chicken embryo fibroblasts. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA of H 5 avian influenza viruses, including the Mexican isolates, indicated that the epidemic virus had originated from the introduction of a single virus of the North American lineage into Mexican chickens. This sequence of events demonstrates, apparently for the first time, the stepwise acquisition of virulence by an avian influenza virus in nature...|$|E
40|$|Renewed {{interest}} in smallpox {{and the need}} for safer vaccines have highlighted our lack of understanding of the requirements for protective immunity. Since smallpox has been eradicated, surrogate animal models of closely related orthopoxviruses, such as ectromelia virus, have been used to establish critical roles for CD 8 T cells in the control of primary infection. To study the requirements for protection against secondary infection, we have used a prime-challenge regime, in which <b>avirulent</b> ectromelia <b>virus</b> was used to prime mice that were then challenged with virulent ectromelia virus. In contrast to primary infection, T cells are not required for recovery from secondary infection, since gene knockout mice deficient in CD 8 T-cell function and wild-type mice acutely depleted of CD 4, CD 8, or both subsets were fully protected. Protection correlated with effective virus control and generation of neutralizing antibody. Notably, primed mice that lacked B cells, major histocompatibility complex class II, or CD 40 succumbed to secondary infection. Thus, antibody is essential, but CD 4 or CD 8 T cells are not required for recovery from secondary poxvirus infection...|$|R
40|$|A triple {{one-step}} RT-PCR {{was developed}} to screen and differentiate virulent from <b>avirulent</b> Newcastle disease <b>virus</b> (NDV) isolates. Three sets of oligonucleotides were designed, each specific for amplifying NDV fusion protein gene-specific RNA from virulent, avirulent or all isolates respectively. The sensitivity of one-step RT-PCR was determined using viral RNA extracted from serially diluted NDV-infected allantoic fluid and found to be 10 (- 5) HA units. Application of one-step RT-PCR to various NDV samples, including wild-type virulent isolates and avirulent vaccine strains, demonstrated the potential for rapid identification (3 - 4 h) of NDV isolates {{as well as the}} differentiation of virulent from avirulent strains...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} virus in macrophages from normal mice {{infected}} in vivo and in vitro with <b>avirulent</b> Semliki Forest <b>Virus</b> A 7 (74) C 1 and virulent L 10 /C 1 {{has been compared to}} that in macrophages infected similarly from mice given Myocrisin (colloidal gold) before inoculation. Very high titres of virus were found in all macrophages which had been "blockaded" with Myocrisin up to 10 (8. 5) /ICLD 50 /ml with the avirulent strain and up to 10 (7. 2) /ICLD 50 /ml with the virulent strain. "Blockade" of the macrophages in this way made the normally avirulent strain virulent. The possible reasons for this are discussed...|$|R
