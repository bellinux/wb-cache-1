40|$|Soil is a {{key part}} <b>of</b> a <b>biotope</b> and {{microorganisms}} are dominant components contributing to soil functions. Conversely, established methods for valuation <b>of</b> <b>biotopes</b> according to Natura 2000 rely predominantly on the communities living on the surface. Here, we aimed to assess soil microbial biomass and community structure on five localities with range <b>of</b> <b>biotope</b> values by means of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiling. PLFA figures were affected both by sampling season (spring vs. autumn) and locality. In spring, the living microbial biomass (estimated by PLFAtot) exhibited poor correlation to biotope values. These were, on the contrary, correlated to trans/cis PLFA, an indicator of microbial stress, (i. e., lower stress in higher-rated biotopes), and fungal/bacterial PLFA (i. e., higher-rated biotopes contained more fungi). The attempt to model biotope values from microbial characteristics explained a maximum of ~ 50 % of the variability; the best predictors were the trans/cis stress indicator, percentage of actinobacterial PLFA, and ratio of PLFA of Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria. These results show that soil microbial characteristics present partly new information and indicate the need to amend the procedures <b>of</b> <b>biotope</b> assessment. Soil PLFA profiling could serve as suitable methods for this purpose...|$|R
40|$|Besides spatial heterogeneity, an {{important}} component of diversity of the protist communities is also the variation in species assemblages through time (temporal turnover). Spatial and temporal variation in patterns <b>of</b> distribution and <b>abundance</b> <b>of</b> lentic microphytobenthos assemblages is often large and occurs at relatively small spatial scale. Desmids (Zygnematophyceae) often constitute a characteristic part of the microphytobenthos of peat bogs. Despite their important role in primary production and fact that they are useful indicators of ecosystem uniqueness, investigations of their seasonality and spatial distribution are scarce. In my thesis I have investigated if desmid epipelic communities are driven rather by neutral or niche-based processes, and I also focused on the factors affecting their diversity, seasonal dynamics and spatial patterns at the local spatial scale. The study was conducted at the two different types <b>of</b> <b>biotopes</b> - minerotrophic lowland peat bogs (Doksy region) and ombrotrophic raised bogs (Jizera Mountains region). Seasonal changes in species composition and diversity of assemblages were not evident. This may be affected by a monopolization effect and also that local <b>abundance</b> <b>of</b> species was positively correlated with population persistence, which suggests that high local [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Triatoma guasayana is a silvatic triatomine species {{distributed}} in Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay. The study {{was performed in}} a secondary forest of Santiago del Estero, Argentina. The <b>abundance</b> <b>of</b> T. guasayana was evaluated by census in the following wild biotopes: quimiles (Opuntia quimilo), chaguares (dry bromeliads), logs and underground burrows. Ten <b>biotopes</b> <b>of</b> each type were dismantled in winter (August) and another 40 in summer (January); all fauna was recorded. The biotopes most infested by T. guasayana were quimiles (65 %), followed by chaguares (55 %), and logs (25 %). Quimiles and chaguares were infested in both seasons, whereas logs were positive only in summer and burrows were never infested. Infestation and abundance were higher in summer than in winter. The biotope structure is a key factor for T. guasayana colonization. The larger number of refuges, the constant presence of blood sources and suitable inner microclimatic conditions offered by quimiles may favour the persistence of T. guasayana colonies. The richness of invertebrate fauna per type <b>of</b> <b>biotope</b> was ranked {{in the same order}} as that of T. guasayana, suggesting similar microhabitat requirements for all studied arthropods...|$|R

A im o f the survey was to detect spatial patterns in epibenthic assemblages to allow {{the assessment of the}} suitability of an existing sidescan sonar and Smith-Mclntyre grab data-derived biotope map for achieving biotope representation in a marine spatial plan. It was shown that both video survey and Smith- Mclntyre grab data exhibited negative spatial autocorrelation, allowing the creation <b>of</b> <b>biotope</b> map polygons through spatial agglomeration of point data. However, a greater number <b>of</b> <b>biotopes</b> could be identified using the epibenthos (video) than the infauna (grab) data, demonstrating that the use <b>of</b> the existing <b>biotope</b> map {{as the basis for the}} design of a marine protected area would have led to an underrepresentation <b>of</b> epibenthic <b>biotopes.</b> It is suggested that the failure of the infaunal (grab) data to detect these biotopes was a result of the sacrifice of fine-scale replication for the sake of the large coverage required for management-scale biotope surveys and it is demonstrated that the remote-video survey method is a highly suitable method for mapping benthic biotopes on management-scale, allowing large spatial coverage without sacrificing fine scale replication.

40|$|The article {{describes}} the A. L. Belgard system of vascular plant species coenomorphs as indicators <b>of</b> <b>biotopes</b> by using standardized Y. P.  Didukh phytometer scales for 12 environmental factors. The classification and ordination of coenomorphs in the phytometer space was performed by using algorithms of discriminant analysis. The analysis is based on 2, 186 species of the vascular plant flora of Ukraine. The classification accuracy was around 80 % and above, the least homogenous was the petrophyte coenomorph. The validity of identification of ruderal coenomorphs was proved as an indicator <b>of</b> <b>biotopes</b> with increased content of soil nitrogen. Analysis of the a posteriori probability of species attribution to a coenomorph supports the validity of distinguishing transitional coenomorphs. Their number is small and each group contains {{a small number of}} species. The principal factors of classifying species by coenomorph are (in descending order of significance) : minimum soil moisture, minimum light (shade), impoverishment of salts in the soil solution, high porosity of soil and impoverishment of carbonates of calcium in the soil and maximum values for radiation balance. The analysis of the distribution of coenomorphs in the space of the square of Mahalanobis distances and the ordination in the discriminant functions axis has determined the ranking <b>of</b> coenomorph <b>of</b> <b>biotope</b> and coenotic substitution: soil moisture (first discriminant function), radiation balance and shade (second discriminant function), salt regime and soil aeration (third discriminant function). For the vegetation of Ukraine this ordination of coenomorphs corresponds to the zonal factors of the distribution <b>of</b> <b>biotopes</b> and their limiting factors and the factors determining A. L.  Belgard’s typology of natural and artificial forests: soil moisture, salinity of the soil solution, light conditions. The coenomorph optima for the principal factors have been defined in phytometer scales. This allows coenomorphs to be used as biotope phytometers and provides a preliminary assessment of those species whose place in the scales has not yet been determined. Analysis of posterior probabilities enabled us to determine the transitional coenomorphs, which are typical for ecotones between zonal and intrazonal vegetational ecosystems of Ukraine...|$|R

Conservationist ideals are commonly overlooked because they require additional physical and economical efforts from the producer.

40|$|The {{intensification}} of agriculture {{during the second}} half of the twentieth century, has caused sever declines of farmland biodiversity, where loss of semi-natural habitats is one of the major drivers. To halt further loss of habitat and biodiversity, agri-environmental schemes (AES) are used to compensate farmers to use methods less harmful to the environment. In this thesis, I have investigated the importance <b>of</b> preserving small <b>biotopes</b> (e. g. field boundaries, road verges, field islets and marl pits) for the persistence of plants and pollinators in agricultural landscapes of varying complexity. I also evaluated the effectiveness of a Swedish AES focused on preventing woody encroachment <b>of</b> small <b>biotopes,</b> with the partial aim of benefiting biodiversity, on the species richness and <b>abundances</b> <b>of</b> pollinators. I surveyed plants and pollinators in different types of habitats found within agricultural landscapes, to investigate the relative importance <b>of</b> small <b>biotopes</b> as habitat for these two groups. I also investigated the local- and landscape-scale effects of removing woody vegetation from small biotopes on pollinators and pollination. The results showed that small biotopes are important for the preservation of both plants and pollinators, within agricultural landscapes of varying structural complexity. Their importance as habitat for pollinators is highest when no mass-flowering crops are available. I also show that the removal of woody vegetation from small biotopes can benefit some pollinator groups while others may be negatively impacted, and although management may benefit pollinators locally, it may not affect the occurrences of pollinators at larger spatial scales. However, the results show that benefits from management <b>of</b> small <b>biotopes</b> are likely to be higher within structurally simple landscapes. The results from this thesis, thus highlights the importance <b>of</b> preserving small <b>biotopes</b> within agricultural landscapes for the conservation of farmland biodiversity. They further illustrate the importance of evaluating and understanding the effects of agri-environmental schemes, since the efficiency of these to enhance biodiversity can vary between organism groups and depend on landscape structure...|$|R
