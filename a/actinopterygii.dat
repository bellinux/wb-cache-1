5|$|Fleshy lobe-fins {{supported}} on bones rather than ray-stiffened fins {{seem to have}} been an ancestral trait of all bony fishes (Osteichthyes). The lobe-finned ancestors of the tetrapods evolved them further, while the ancestors of the ray-finned fishes (<b>Actinopterygii)</b> evolved their fins in a different direction. The most primitive group of actinopterygians, the bichirs, still have fleshy frontal fins.|$|E
5|$|The bowfin is an <b>actinopterygii</b> {{which means}} that the {{pectoral}} girdle is partly endochondral but mostly dermal bone. In this group of fishes the fins function to maneuver, brake, and for slight positional adjustments. The pectoral girdle of the bowfin has six parts. The post temporal, supracleithrum, postcleithrum, cleithrum, scapulacoracoid, and the clavicle make up the pectoral girdle.The pectoral girdle is attached to the skull. The pectoral girl is made of mostly dermal and some endochondral bone. The paired pectoral and pelvic fins of fish are homologous with the limbs of tetrapods.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} teleost is denser than water, so fish must {{compensate}} for the difference or they will sink. Many teleosts have a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases {{to allow them to}} stay at the current water depth, or ascend or descend without having to waste energy in swimming. In the more primitive groups like some minnows, the swim bladder is open to the esophagus and doubles as a lung. It is often absent in fast-swimming fishes such as the tuna and mackerel. In fish where the swim bladder is closed, the gas content is controlled through the rete mirabilis, a network of blood vessels serving as a countercurrent gas exchanger between the swim bladder and the blood. The Chondrostei such as sturgeons also have a swim bladder, but this appears to have evolved separately: other <b>Actinopterygii</b> such as the bowfin and the bichir do not have one, so swim bladders appear to have arisen twice, and the teleost swim bladder is not homologous with the chondrostean one.|$|E
5|$|The common {{ancestor}} of all present gnathostomes (jawed-vertebrates) lived in freshwater, and later migrated {{back to the}} sea. To deal with the much higher salinity in sea water, they evolved the ability to turn the nitrogen waste product ammonia into harmless urea, storing it in the body to give the blood the same osmolarity as the sea water without poisoning the organism. This is the system currently found in cartilaginous fishes. Ray-finned fishes (<b>Actinopterygii)</b> later returned to freshwater and lost this ability, while the fleshy-finned fishes (Sarcopterygii) retained it. Since the blood of ray-finned fishes contains more salt than freshwater, they could simply get rid of ammonia through their gills. When they finally returned to the sea again, they did not recover their old trick of turning ammonia to urea, {{and they had to}} evolve salt excreting glands instead. Lungfishes do the same when they are living in water, making ammonia and no urea, but when the water dries up and they are forced to burrow down in the mud, they switch to urea production. Like cartilaginous fishes, the coelacanth can store urea in its blood, as can the only known amphibians that can live {{for long periods of time}} in salt water (the toad Bufo marinus and the frog Rana cancrivora). These are traits they have inherited from their ancestors.|$|E

25|$|Ray-finned fishes, class <b>Actinopterygii,</b> {{differ from}} lobe-finned fishes in that their fins consist of webs of skin {{supported}} by spines ("rays") made of bone or horn. There are other differences in respiratory and circulatory structures. Ray-finned fishes normally have skeletons made from true bone, {{though this is}} not true of sturgeons and paddlefishes.|$|E
25|$|Bony fishes, class Osteichthyes, are characterised by bony {{skeleton}} {{rather than}} cartilage. They {{appeared in the}} late Silurian, about 419 million years ago. The recent discovery of Entelognathus strongly suggests that bony fishes (and possibly cartilaginous fishes, via acanthodians) evolved from early placoderms. A subclass of the Osteichthyes, the ray-finned fishes (<b>Actinopterygii),</b> have become the dominant group of fishes in the post-Paleozoic and modern world, with some 30,000 living species.|$|E
25|$|Remains of the {{cartilaginous}} fish Antarctilamna sp., the Placoderms Asterolepis sp. and {{two species}} of Bothriolepis, the spiny shark ?Cheiracanthoides sp., the Porolepiform Holoptychius sp., and the Rhizodontid ?Strepsodus sp. have been uncovered from the Cuche Formation. Several other fossils are less well recognizable at the genus level, among others <b>Actinopterygii,</b> Sarcopterygii, and Osteolepiformes. The fish specimens were found in sediments possibly representing localized transgressive marine incursions into brackish lagoonal settings, in all cases associated {{with the presence of}} bivalves, ostracods and brachiopods.|$|E
25|$|The first jawed {{vertebrates}} probably {{developed during}} the late Ordovician period. They are first represented in the fossil record from the Silurian by two groups of fish: the armoured fish known as placoderms, which evolved from the ostracoderms; and the Acanthodii (or spiny sharks). The jawed fish that are still extant in modern days also appeared in late Silurian: the Chondrichthyes (or cartilaginous fish) and the Osteichthyes (or bony fish). The bony fish evolved into two separate groups: the <b>Actinopterygii</b> (or ray-finned fish) and Sarcopterygii (which includes the lobe-finned fish).|$|E
25|$|The species Amphiprion ocellaris {{belongs to}} the class <b>Actinopterygii</b> which {{contains}} bony Teleost fish and other ray-finned fish. A. ocellaris is the most basal species in the genus Amphiprion which {{is closely related to}} the genus Premnas. The species' most closely related ancestor is Amphiprion percula, the Orange clownfish. It is thought that A. ocellaris specialized after diverging from the Premnas genus, and scientific evidence confirms that all clownfish belonging to the genus Amphiprion initially could withstand the stings of only one type of anemone; after further speciation the 28 different species of clownfish including A. ocellaris have specialized to be able to resist the poisonous stings of many different anemone species.|$|E
25|$|The Devonian Period {{is broken}} into the Early, Middle and Late Devonian. By {{the start of}} the Early Devonian 419 mya, jawed fishes had divided into four {{distinct}} clades: the placoderms and spiny sharks, both of which are now extinct, and the cartilaginous and bony fishes, both of which are still extant. The modern bony fishes, class Osteichthyes, appeared in the late Silurian or early Devonian, about 416 million years ago. Both the cartilaginous and bony fishes may have arisen from either the placoderms or the spiny sharks. A subclass of bony fishes, the ray-finned fishes (<b>Actinopterygii),</b> have become the dominant group in the post-Paleozoic and modern world, with some 30,000 living species.|$|E
500|$|The extant ray-finned fishes of the {{subclass}} <b>Actinopterygii</b> include 42 orders, 431 {{families and}} over 23,000 species. [...] They are currently classified into two infraclasses, Chondrostei (holosteans) and Neopterygii (teleost fishes). [...] Sturgeons, paddlefish, bichirs and reed fish compose the thirty-eight species of chondrosteans, and are considered relict species. [...] Included in the over 23,000 species of neopterygians are eight relict species comprising gars and the bowfin.|$|E
500|$|The teleosts or Teleostei (Greek: teleios, [...] "complete" [...] + osteon, [...] "bone") {{are by far}} {{the largest}} infraclass in the class <b>Actinopterygii,</b> the ray-finned fishes, and make up 96% of all extant species of fish. This diverse group arose in the Triassic period, and members are {{arranged}} in about 40 orders and 448 families. Over 26,000 species have been described. Teleosts range from giant oarfish measuring [...] or more, and ocean sunfish weighing over , to the minute male anglerfish Photocorynus spiniceps, just [...] long. Including not only torpedo-shaped fish built for speed, teleosts can be flattened vertically or horizontally, be elongated cylinders or take specialised shapes as in anglerfish and seahorses. Teleosts dominate the seas from pole to pole and inhabit the ocean depths, estuaries, rivers, lakes and even swamps.|$|E
2500|$|The first jawed {{vertebrates}} {{appeared in}} the late Ordovician and became common in the Devonian, often known as the [...] "Age of Fishes". The two groups of [...] bony fishes, the <b>actinopterygii</b> and sarcopterygii, evolved and became common. The Devonian also saw the demise of virtually all jawless fishes, save for lampreys and hagfish, {{as well as the}} Placodermi, a group of armoured fish that dominated much of the late Silurian. The Devonian also saw the rise of the first labyrinthodonts, which was a transitional between fishes and amphibians.|$|E
2500|$|Synodus intermedius, {{the sand}} diver, is {{a species of}} fish in the {{lizardfish}} family, Synodontidae, a basal ray-finned fish in the class <b>Actinopterygii.</b> The etymology of Synodus is of Greek origin: [...] "syn", symphysis or grown together, and [...] "odous" [...] which means teeth. [...] Sand divers inhabit subtropical marine ecosystems, (37°N-17°N), including sandy bottom areas on continental shelves, coral reefs, estuaries, bays, and reef structures. [...] They are demersal or benthic fish, which means they live on or close to the sea bed. [...] Distribution ranges from the northern Gulf of Mexico south to the Guianas, and western Atlantic north to North Carolina and Bermuda. [...] They are a common lizardfish in the West Indies. [...] They grow to approximately [...] total length, and weigh around [...]|$|E
