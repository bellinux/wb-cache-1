25|$|Born in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, Romney's {{first-class}} debut came against Leicestershire: he made 4 and 10 not out. In {{his next}} game against Oxford University he hit what {{proved to be}} his highest score, 20 not out (the second top score in the innings) as Worcestershire were dismissed for 121 (they went on to lose by three wickets). Poor displays against Gloucestershire and MCC followed, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{as far as his}} first-class career was concerned.|$|E
25|$|Gomez, in his 2000 autobiography, {{wrote about}} Duke:He once {{presented}} a {{bill on the}} floor, {{one of the few}} which he had managed to get out of committee. He finished his opening presentation and strolled with great self-satisfaction back up the aisle to his seat. In his mind, he had spoken, made his presentation <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>that.</b> Before he had even reached his desk and re-focused on the proceedings, another first-term member had been recognized for the floor and immediately moved to table the bill. The House voted for the motions effectively killing the bill. That and similar procedures were used against him many times. Gomez said that he recalls Duke obtaining the passage of only a single bill, legislation which prohibited movie producers or book publishers from compensating jurors for accounts of their court experiences.|$|E
500|$|A one-man play, Tom Crean‚Äì Antarctic Explorer, {{has been}} widely {{performed}} since 2001 by author Aidan Dooley, including a special showing at the South Pole Inn, Annascaul, in October 2001. Present were Crean's daughters, Eileen and Mary, both in their 80s. Apparently he never told them stories of his exploits; according to Eileen: [...] "He put his medals and his sword in a box... <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>that.</b> He was a very humble man".|$|E
25|$|What {{it really}} {{highlights}} though <b>is</b> <b>that</b> nothing has really changed in our strategy, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{we need to}} re-equip, we need to grow our capacity, {{we need to have}} new products, so I think it just brings these objectives into focus more and more by having a high profile about what's happened.|$|R
2500|$|The only {{exception}} {{was by the}} Dominican Republic, which pledged to accept 100,000 refugees on generous terms. Meir was disappointed at the outcome and she remarked to the press, [...] "There is only one thing I hope to see before I die <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> my people should not need expressions of sympathy anymore." ...|$|R
2500|$|Of the Zambaco affair, {{which would}} sputter {{on for some}} years, Georgiana wrote to her dear friend Rosalind Howard [...] "Dearest Rosalind, be hard on {{no one in this}} matter, and exalt no one, and may we all come through it at last. I know one thing, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> enough love between Edward and me to last out a long life if it is given us".|$|R
500|$|Flying symbolizes Jim's {{possibility}} and danger of {{escape from the}} prison camp. His growing alienation from his prewar self and society is reflected in his hero-worship of the Japanese aviators based at the airfield adjoining the camp. [...] "I think it's true that the Japanese were pretty brutal with the Chinese, so I don't have any particularly sentimental view of them," [...] Ballard recalled. [...] "But small boys tend to find their heroes where they can. One thing {{there was no doubt}} about, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Japanese were extremely brave. One had very complicated views about patriotism [...] loyalty to one's own nation. Jim is constantly identifying himself, first with the Japanese; then, when the Americans start flying over in their Mustangs and B-29s, he's very drawn to the American." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{dropped the}} I-76 or the Imperial Japanese Navy Trans-Pacific Submarine {{down into the}} mouth of the Columbia River, dead duck. And it went down with a resounding furor. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>that.</b> I never thought about it again {{particularly}} except to get mad at all the admirals I had to make reports to because of this thing, see? This was one out of seventy-nine separate actions that I had to do with. And it had no significance, see? ...|$|E
2500|$|The first outing of the Lot Whitcomb was a {{pleasure}} expedition to Astoria. [...] There was a problem running her on the Columbia River, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> she still had creditors that hadn't been paid who {{had an interest in}} the vessel. [...] American law did not then allow a vessel to operate without a certificate and a certificate could not be lawfully issued if creditors had unpaid claims against the vessel. [...] Worse yet, the official in charge of enforcing this law was the Astoria customs inspector, General Adair, who was a co-owner the Columbia, the only other steamboat on the Columbia River at the time, and as such the chief rival of Lot Whitcomb. [...] More stock was sold to pay off the ship's debts, and regularized operations were finally able to begin.|$|E
50|$|Although Dutch {{lawmakers have}} {{historically}} favored being very conservative about creating special legal positions {{for members of}} the royal house or the royal family, there is one area in which the rules {{for members of the}} royal house are very different from those for other Dutch citizens: the area of death and burial. More specifically, there <b>is</b> only one rule <b>that</b> pertains to members of the royal house in this area <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there <b>are</b> no rules.|$|R
500|$|On May 14, {{the day of}} the {{scheduled}} vote on Thorne-Begland's appointment, Republican Governor Bob McDonnell stated that the candidate's sexuality should not be an issue: [...] "All I can tell you is what I've always said about judges, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> these ought to <b>be</b> merit-based selections solely based on a person's skill, ability, fairness, judicial temperament". Thorne-Begland also attempted to address concerns by pledging to [...] "neutrally apply the laws" [...] and avoid political advocacy.|$|R
2500|$|Through this {{proof by contradiction}} we {{have proven}} that the {{cardinality}} of ‚Ñï and ùí´(‚Ñï) cannot be equal. We {{also know that the}} cardinality of ùí´(‚Ñï) cannot be less than the cardinality of ‚Ñï because ùí´(‚Ñï) contains all singletons, by definition, and these singletons form a [...] "copy" [...] of ‚Ñï inside of ùí´(‚Ñï). Therefore, only one possibility remains, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the cardinality of ùí´(‚Ñï) is strictly greater than the cardinality of ‚Ñï, proving Cantor's theorem.|$|R
2500|$|After his {{retirement}} from Somerset, Close {{continued to play}} at the Scarborough Festival against the touring international teams, first for T.N. Pearce's XI in 1978 and then for his own XI from 1982 to 1986. In 1986, aged 55, and playing his last-ever first-class innings, Close needed 10 runs to achieve a career-total 35,000 runs. With his score on 4 he glanced a ball down leg-side to the wicket-keeper and walked. Afterwards, the New Zealanders said that if they'd known how near he was to the landmark, they would have let him stay, but Close {{would have none of it}} ‚Äì he was out, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>that.</b> When asked why he gave himself out he said: [...] "It's an honourable game and that's the way I was brought up." [...] Close's 786 first-class matches leave him 10th on the all-time list. Only four outfielders have taken more catches.|$|E
2500|$|Promoted to full {{general in}} 1962, he was {{assigned}} as vice {{chief of staff of}} the U.S. Army amid speculation that he would soon succeed Army chief of staff George H. Decker, who was not expected to be reappointed. As vice chief of staff, Hamlett negotiated the creation of U.S. Strike Command with Air Force chief of staff Curtis E. LeMay, played a key role in Army operations during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and participated in the escalation of the Vietnam War. Reflecting on this period later, Hamlett said, [...] "I think the most important thing was something I didn't recommend; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> we didn't become involved in Vietnam to the point where we would have to commit combat forces. I think it was a failure, and I would have to say that I shared the responsibility because I didn't see far enough ahead to speak out." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{himself was}} not very cheerful, for day after day brought nearer the time when that {{uncertain}} Stede Bonnet might arrive in Jamaica, and what would happen after that no man could tell. One thing he greatly feared, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> his dear niece, Kate, might {{be taken away from}} him. Dame Charter was not so very cheerful either. Only in one way did she believe in Stede Bonnet, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> after some fashion or another he would come between her and her bright dreams for her dear Dickory.|$|E
2500|$|In an August 27, 2006, {{appearance}} on Meet the Press, Novak {{was asked if}} indeed Armitage was his source of Mrs. Wilson's identity as a CIA operative. Novak responded: [...] "I told Mr. Isikoff... that I do not identify my sources on any subject if they're on a confidential basis until they identify themselves... I'm going to say one thing, though, I haven't said before. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I believe {{that the time has}} way passed for my source to identify himself." ...|$|R
50|$|According to Ernst Oppert, An observation, founded upon {{many years}} experience, {{may not be}} out of place here, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> among all Asiatic nationalities there is {{probably}} none more inclined to be converted to Christianity than the Corean....He becomes a Christian from conviction, not from any mercenary motives. Bishop and martyr Simeon Francois Berneux wrote, The Corean possesses the most perfect dispositions for receiving the faith. Once convinced, he accepts and attaches himself to it, {{in spite of all}} sacrifices it may cost him.|$|R
25|$|Some {{people have}} {{characterized}} his removal as a rendition. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> {{not what happened}} here. It was a deportation. And {{even if it were}} a rendition, we understand as a government what our obligations are with respect to anyone who is rendered by this government to another country, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we seek to satisfy ourselves <b>that</b> they will not <b>be</b> tortured. <b>And</b> we do <b>that</b> in every case. And if in fact he had been rendered to Syria, we would have sought those same kind of assurances, as we do in every case.|$|R
60|$|All my shopkeeper could say, was, {{that he had}} got a salve {{for that}} sore, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> when Timothy {{was out of his}} time, he {{resolved}} to take him in partner.|$|E
60|$|Upon {{one thing}} he {{determined}} at once, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> until his charges were safely in England they should not hear a whisper of this new and terrible misfortune which had befallen them.|$|E
60|$|Evidently Sampson {{understood}} the man before him {{so well that}} he wasted no more words. I knew what Wright never dreamed of, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Sampson had a gun somewhere within reach and meant to use it.|$|E
25|$|I am {{very fond}} of jazz music, and I swear by all the devils in the nether regions <b>that</b> every person shall <b>be</b> spared in whose home a jazz band {{is in full swing}} at the time I have just mentioned. If {{everyone}} has a jazz band going, well, then, so much the better for you people. One thing <b>is</b> certain <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> some of your people who do not jazz it out on that specific Tuesday night (if there be any) will get the axe.|$|R
2500|$|At the October 2015 primary debate, Clinton's chief rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, defended Clinton, saying: [...] "Let me say this. Let me say {{something}} <b>that</b> may not <b>be</b> great politics. But I think the secretary <b>is</b> right. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the American people <b>are</b> {{sick and tired of}} hearing about your damn emails!" [...] Sanders later clarified that he thought Clinton's emails were a [...] "very serious issue", but Americans want a discussion on issues <b>that</b> <b>are</b> [...] "real" [...] to them, such as paid family and medical leave, college affordability, and campaign finance reform.|$|R
2500|$|On 20 January, {{the ship}} began {{shifting}} by [...] per hour, but on 24 January, Franco Gabrielli, [...] the Italian Civil Protection Agency head, said {{the ship was}} [...] "stable". The same day divers recovered {{the body of the}} 16th victim. On 29 January, the operation was suspended because the ship had shifted [...] in six hours and because of high waves. Gabrielli said, [...] "Our first goal was to find people alive ... Now we have a single, big goal, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this does not translate into an environmental disaster." [...] By the next day, operations resumed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{as we were}} {{speaking}} about you, Mr. Craig," [...] the landlady continued. [...] "I was saying to the young lady {{that there was only}} one thing I could wish for you both, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> you weren't quite so worried like." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{spoke with}} a quiet {{precision}} that had its effect; and, whatever the girl felt, she obeyed each command in rotation. There was, however, one danger which the stranger realized, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> with an involuntary contraction of the forefinger she might anticipate the last one.|$|E
60|$|This {{girl said}} there was one {{stipulation}} she should like to make, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> she {{should be allowed to}} pay for all breakages caused by her own carelessness or neglect.

500|$|Clough {{paid tribute}} to Taylor when {{he was awarded the}} freedom of the city of Nottingham in March 1993, saying that [...] "I have only one regret today, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> me mate isn't here with me". Taylor was portrayed by Timothy Spall in The Damned United, a film {{released}} in 2009 based on Clough's ill-fated spell at Leeds United. In August 2010, Derby County unveiled a statue of Clough and Taylor at Pride Park Stadium. In September 2015, Nottingham Forest announced that the Main Stand at the City Ground would be renamed the Peter Taylor Stand as part of the club's 150th anniversary celebrations.|$|R
2500|$|In her {{autobiography}} My Life (1975), Golda Meir {{described her}} outrage being in [...] "the ludicrous {{capacity of the}} [...] observer from Palestine, not even seated with the delegates, although the refugees under discussion were my own people...." [...] After the conference Meir told the press: [...] "There is only one thing I hope to see before I die <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> my people should not need expressions of sympathy anymore." [...] Chaim Weizmann was quoted in The Manchester Guardian as saying: [...] "The world seemed to {{be divided into two}} parts ‚Äì those places where the Jews could not live and those where they could not enter." ...|$|R
60|$|There was but one {{cloud in}} the midst of all this sunshine, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Delaplaine, Dame Charter, and her son Dickory could not forget that it was now in the line of events that Stede Bonnet would soon be with them, and beyond that all was chaos.|$|E
60|$|He went at {{his duties}} with a willing spirit, {{resolved}} {{that there should}} be no cause for complaint during his last days on the bridge.

60|$|Jane had but {{a single}} reply for his every proposition, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> nothing would ever persuade her to permit Rokoff upon the same vessel with her.

30|$|Wiklund (1998) {{brings up}} an {{interesting}} limitation of research focusing on management <b>and</b> entrepreneurial characteristics/traits, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{they have only}} an indirect effect on growth. If {{instead of focusing on}} defining the characteristics/traits of the manager, one follows the idea of Wiklund (1998), focusing on what the managers actually do and how this work relates to growth, it seems a promising way to reach an understanding of the relation between top-managers‚Äô work and growth. This view also opens the possibility of joining the research tradition of traits with studies that have focused on the behaviour/roles of the entrepreneur/top-manager (for instance Choran 1969 in Mintzberg 1973, Noel 1989, O‚ÄôGorman 2001, Flor√©n and Tell 2004).|$|R

500|$|The film's most-quoted line of dialogue, {{spoken by}} Octave, is [...] "You see, in this world, there <b>is</b> one awful thing, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{everyone}} has his reasons." [...] Renoir's sentiment of objective humanism for the film's characters is articulated by Octave's remark and shows his empathy {{for the people}} he was simultaneously criticizing. Richard Roud praised Renoir's role in the film, observing that Renoir's honesty compelled him to include his own role in his social criticism: [...] "he {{did not wish to}} stand outside. And Renoir/Octave serves as the standard against which reality and fiction can be measured." [...] In his original outline for the film, Renoir said he intended all the characters to <b>be</b> sincere <b>and</b> <b>that</b> the film would have no villains.|$|R
