The development of new simulation methods and new computer architectures enables an enormous improvement of the productivity {{of research and development}} of new chemical synthesis and materials. These advances can be achieved in terms of less time, material, and staff compared to traditional lab experiments. Especially, approaches like virtual high throughput screenings (vHTS) are highly scalable and allow fast and deep insights into new promising system modifications. Consequently, the time to market and risk of new product development can be decreased significantly. These characteristics {{paved the way for the}} successful application in industry nowadays...|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} {{undertaken}} to fill needs in ODE's human and ecosystem health effects research, site remediation, rapid emergency response, and regulatory compliance monitoring programs. Doe has greatly stimulated development and validation of antibody-based, rapid, field-portable detection systems for small hazardous compounds. These range from simple dipsticks, microplate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), and hand-held colorimeters, to ultrasensitive microfluidic reactors, fiber-optic sensors and microarrays that can identify multiple analytes from patterns of cross-reactivity. Unfortunately, {{the technology to}} produce antibodies with the most desirable properties did not keep pace. Lack of antibodies remains a limiting factor in production and practical use of such devices. The goals of our project were to determine the chemical and structural bases for the antibody-analyte binding interactions using <b>advanced</b> <b>computational</b> <b>chemistry,</b> and to use this information to create useful new binding properties through in vitro genetic engineering and combinatorial library methods...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{intramolecular}} basis set superposition errors are less well documented than the corresponding intermolecular effects. The intramolecular basis set superposition errors are examined, using {{the approach of}} Jensen, for several basis sets developed by Pople and his co-workers, which are widely used in studies of larger molecules. Prototype calculations are reported for the ground state of the water molecule using both the matrix Hartree-Fock method and the many-body perturbation expansion for the correlation energy taken through second order. A similar investigation is carried out {{for some of the}} correlation consistent basis sets published by Dunning and his collaborators. Specifically, the following aspects are investigated: (i) the magnitude of the intramolecular basis set superposition error, (ii) the nonadditivity of intramolecular counterpoise corrections when applied in a pairwise fashion, and (iii) the use of multiple >ghost> centers. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Congurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the isobaric-isothermal Gibbs ensemble were used to investigate the partitioning of benzene, toluene, and the three xylene isomers between a squalane liquid phase and a helium vapor phase. The united-atom representation of the TraPPE (Transferable Potentials for Phase Equilibria) force eld was used for all solutes and squalane. The Gibbs free energies of transfer and Kovats retention indices of the solutes were calculated directly from the partition constants (which were averaged over several independent simulations).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we review recent <b>advances</b> in <b>computational</b> <b>chemistry</b> and {{specifically}} {{focus on the}} chemical description of heme proteins and synthetic porphyrins that act as both mimics of natural processes and technological uses.

In recent years computational tools have improved considerably and now can reproduce experimental spectroscopic and reactivity studies within a reasonable error margin (several kcal·mol− 1). This paper gives recent examples from our groups, where we investigated heme and synthetic metal-porphyrin systems. The four case studies highlight how computational modelling can correctly reproduce experimental product distributions, predicted reactivity trends and guide interpretation of electronic structures of complex systems.

40|$|Using novel <b>advances</b> in <b>computational</b> <b>chemistry,</b> we {{demonstrate}} that the set of 20 genetically encoded amino acids, used nearly universally to construct all coded terrestrial proteins, has been highly influenced by natural selection. We defined an adaptive set of amino acids as one whose members thoroughly cover relevant physico-chemical properties, or “chemistry space. ” Using this metric, we compared the encoded amino acid alphabet to random sets of amino acids. These random sets were drawn from a computationally generated compound library containing 1913 alternative amino acids that lie within the molecular weight range of the encoded amino acids. Sets that cover chemistry space better than the genetically encoded alphabet are extremely rare and energetically costly. Further analysis of more adaptive sets reveals common features and anomalies, and we explore their implications for synthetic biology. We present these computations {{as evidence that the}} set of 20 amino acids found within the standard genetic code is the result of considerable natural selection. The amino acids used for constructing coded proteins may represent a largely global optimum, such that any aqueous biochemistry would use a very similar set...|$|R
40|$|Recent <b>advances</b> in <b>computational</b> <b>chemistry</b> have {{produced}} force fields {{based on a}} polarizable atomic multipole descrip-tion of biomolecular electrostatics. In this work, the Atomic Multipole Optimized Energetics for Biomolecular Applica-tions (AMOEBA) force field is applied to restrained refinement of molecular models against X-ray diffraction data from peptide crystals. A new formalism is also developed to compute anisotropic and aspherical structure factors using fast Fourier transformation (FFT) of Cartesian Gaussian multi-poles. Relative to direct summation, the FFT approach can give a speedup of more than {{an order of magnitude}} for aspherical refinement of ultrahigh-resolution data sets. Use of a sublattice formalism makes the method highly parallelizable. Application of the Cartesian Gaussian multipole scattering model to a series of four peptide crystals using multipole coefficients from the AMOEBA force field demonstrates that AMOEBA systematically underestimates electron density at bond centers. For the trigonal and tetrahedral bonding geometries common in organic chemistry, an atomic multipole expansion through hexadecapole order is required to explain bond electron density. Alternatively, the addition of inter-atomic scattering (IAS) sites to the AMOEBA-based density captured bonding effects with fewer parameters. For a series of four peptide crystals, the AMOEBA–IAS model lowered Rfree by 20 – 40 % relative to the original spherically symmetric scattering model...|$|R
40|$|Recent <b>advances</b> in <b>computational</b> <b>chemistry</b> {{have made}} it {{feasible}} to design many types of molecules and predict their properties theoretically. The author applied these techniques to the design of organometallic transition-metal dyes absorbing in the near-infrared region of the spectrum which possess the combination of a large molar extinction coefficient, good chemical and thermal stability, and a high solubility in liquid crystal (LC) hosts. These properties are required for the dye to function as a near-infrared (IR) attenuator in a liquid crystal point diffraction interferometer (LCPDI) device that will be used as a beam diagnostic on the 60 -beam OMEGA solid-state Nd:glass laser system at the University of Rochester`s Laboratory for Laser Energetics. Using commercially available software, both the absorption spectra and solubility characteristics of bis[1, 2 -di-(p-n alkoxyphenyl) ethane- 1, 2 -dithione] nickel dye complexes were modeled in an isotropic host (cyclohexane) and, in most cases, excellent agreement was found with experimental data. Two additional compounds utilizing the same nickel dithiolene core but with alkylthio and phenylalkylthio terminal groups have been designed and show excellent potential to produce dramatic improvements in both solubility and optical density (absorbance) in liquid crystalline hosts. Based upon my work, a new dye not previously reported, 2 (C{sub 4 }S) 2 (C{sub 4 }SPh) DTNi, has been proposed to satisfy the LCPDI device requirements. The nickel dithiolene dyes may also find important applications in other technology areas such as near-IR photography and laser-based near-IR communications...|$|R

40|$|Advances in {{nanotechnology}} {{have the}} potential to utilize biological and polymeric systems to address fundamental scientific and societal issues, including molecular electronics and sensors, energy-relevant light harvesting, “green” catalysis, and environmental cleanup. In many cases, synthesis and fabrication are well within grasp, but designing such systems requires simultaneous consideration of large numbers of degrees of freedom including structure, sequence, and functional properties. In the case of protein design, even simply considering amino acid identity scales exponentially with the protein length. This work utilizes computational techniques to develop a fundamental, molecularly detailed chemical and physical understanding to investigate and design such nano-assemblies. Throughout, we leverage a probabilistic computational design approach to guide the identification of protein sequences that fold to predetermined structures with targeted function. The statistical methodology is encapsulated in a computational design platform, recently reconstructed with improvements in speed and versatility, to estimate site-specific probabilities of residues through the optimization of an effective sequence free energy. This provides an information-rich perspective on the space of possible sequences which is able to harness the incorporation of new constraints that fit design objectives. The approach is applied to the design and modeling of protein systems incorporating non-biological cofactors, namely (i) an aggregation prone peptide assembly to bind uranyl and (ii) a protein construct to encapsulate a zinc porphyrin derivative with unique photo-physical properties. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations are used to investigate purely synthetic assemblies of (iii) highly charged semiconducting polymers that wrap and disperse carbon nanotubes. Free energy calculations are used to explore the factors that lead to observed polymer-SWNT super-structures, elucidating well-defined helical structures; for chiral derivatives, the simulations corroborate a preference for helical handedness observed in TEM and AFM data. The techniques detailed herein, demonstrate how <b>advances</b> in <b>computational</b> <b>chemistry</b> allot greater control and specificity in the engineering of novel nano-materials and offer the potential to greatly advance applications of these systems. ...|$|R
