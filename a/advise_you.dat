25|$|L: Well, Mr. President, {{that is your}} decision, certainly. I cannot <b>advise</b> <b>you</b> {{one way or the}} other. But as I've said, if I {{can ever}} be of any {{assistance}} in looking after your security, I would certainly do so.|$|E
25|$|But then I confess, {{you have}} one reason that I am unable to confute, — which is the {{contrary}} judgment of your neighbour ministers. They may see more than I can, (especially such as judicious and honest Mr. Fisher, who knoweth both places.) And, therefore, I presume not peremptorily to <b>advise</b> <b>you,</b> but to cast in my thoughts; which, if they seem unsatisfactory to you, reject them.|$|E
25|$|I deem it {{important}} to direct your attention to Article 2 of the Constitutional Amendments of the United States—'the {{right of the people}} to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.' This you should comply with immediately. Every (local) union should have a rifle club. I strongly <b>advise</b> <b>you</b> to provide every member with the latest improved rifle, which can be obtained from the factory at a nominal price. I entreat you to take action on this important question, so that in two years we can hear the inspiring music of the martial tread of 25,000 armed men in the ranks of labor.|$|E

Have pity on people and cease to destroy them: we did not give life to anyone nor do {{we have the right to}} take it away from others: but because you shall not send your soldiers to a certain death, since we are not to surrender the fortress without a fierce and bitter resistance.|$|E
500|$|Nielsen's {{philosophy}} of music style is perhaps {{summed up in}} his advice in a 1907 letter to the Norwegian composer Knut Harder: [...] "You have... fluency, so far, so good; but I <b>advise</b> <b>you</b> again and again, my dear Mr. Harder; Tonality, Clarity, Strength.|$|E
500|$|O'Brien {{claimed that}} all of the {{evidence}} given against him was false, and that as an American citizen he ought not to be facing trial in a UK court. He then went on at length to condemn the British government, the [...] "imbecile and tyrannical rulers" [...] of Ireland, until he was interrupted by the judge, who appealed to him to cease his remarks: [...] "The only effect of your observations must be to tell against you with those who have to consider the sentence. I <b>advise</b> <b>you</b> to say nothing more of that sort. I do so entirely for your own sake." ...|$|E

500|$|The Boultons {{had three}} daughters {{in the early}} 1750s, but all died in infancy. [...] Mary Boulton's health deteriorated, and she died in August 1759. Not long after her death Boulton began to woo her sister Anne. [...] Marriage with a {{deceased}} wife's sister was forbidden by ecclesiastical law, though permitted by common law. Nonetheless, they married on 25 June 1760 at St. Mary's Church, Rotherhithe. [...] Eric Delieb, who wrote a book on Boulton's silver, with a biographical sketch, suggests that the marriage celebrant, Rev. James Penfold, an impoverished curate, was probably bribed. [...] Boulton later advised another man who was seeking to wed his late wife's sister: [...] "I <b>advise</b> <b>you</b> {{to say nothing of}} your intentions but to go quickly and snugly to Scotland or some obscure corner of London, suppose Wapping, and there take lodgings to make yourself a parishioner. [...] When the month is expired and the Law fulfilled, live and be happy... I recommend silence, secrecy, and Scotland." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1616, {{two years}} after Peacham's Case, the case of commendams arose. The in commendam writ was a method of {{transferring}} ecclesiastical property, which James used in this case to allow Richard Neile to hold his bishopric and associated revenues without actually performing the duties. On 25 April 1616 the courts, at Coke's bidding, held that this action was illegal, writing to the king that [...] "in case any letters come unto us contrary to law, we do nothing by such letters, but certify your Majesty thereof, and go forth to do the law notwithstanding the same". James called the judges before him and, furious, ripped up the letter, patronisingly telling them that [...] "I well know the true and ancient common law {{to be the most}} favourable to Kings of any law in the world, to which law I do <b>advise</b> <b>you</b> my Judges to apply your studies". While all the other judges [...] "succumbed to royal pressure and, throwing themselves on their knees, prayed for pardon", Coke defended the letter and stated that [...] "When the case happens I shall do that which shall be fit for a judge to do".|$|E
500|$|The first scandal to taint the Grant {{administration}} in 1869 was Black Friday, {{also known as}} the Gold Panic, which was an attempt by two aggressive financiers to corner the price of gold without regard to the nation's economic welfare. The intricate financial scheme was primarily conceived and administered by Wall Street manipulators Jay Gould and his partner James Fisk. Their plan was to convince President Grant not to sell Treasury gold, in order to increase the sales of agriculture products overseas and increase the shipping business of Gould's Erie Railroad. Gould and Fisk were able to get Grant's brother-in-law, Abel Rathbone Corbin, involved with the scheme {{as a way to get}} access to Grant himself. [...] Gould had also given a $10,000 bribe to the assistant Secretary of the Treasury, Daniel Butterfield, in exchange for inside information. On June 5, 1869, while Grant was traveling from New York to Boston on The Providence, a ship owned by both Gould and Fisk, the two speculators urged Grant not to sell any gold from the Treasury and attempted to convince him that a high price of gold helped farmers and the Erie Railroad. President Grant, however, was stoic and did not agree to Fisk and Gould's suggestion to stop releasing Treasury Gold into the market. Grant's Secretary of Treasury, George S. Boutwell, continued to sell Treasury gold on the open market. In late August 1869, President Grant consulted with businessman, A. T. Stewart, Grant's initial Cabinet nominee for Secretary of Treasury, concerning the Treasury's selling gold. Stewart advised Grant that the Treasury should not sell gold, in order that the Government would not be involved in the gold market. Grant accepted Stewart's advise and wrote to Boutwell that selling extra Treasury gold would upset agriculture sales. Boutwell had, on September 1, originally ordered $9,000,000 in gold to be sold from the Treasury in order to buy up U.S. Bonds with greenbacks. However, after receiving a letter from Grant, Boutwell cancelled the order. Previously, Secretary Boutwell had been selling regularly at $1,000,000 of gold each week. On September 6, 1869, Gould bought the Tenth National Bank, which was used as a buying house for gold, and Gould and Fisk then began buying gold in earnest. As the price of gold began to rise, Grant became suspicious of possible manipulation and wrote a letter to Secretary Boutwell on September 12, stating [...] "The fact is, a desperate struggle is now taking place...I write this letter to <b>advise</b> <b>you</b> of what I think you may expect, to put you on your guard." [...] However, President Grant's personal associations with Gould and Fisk gave them the clout that they needed to continue their financial scam on Wall Street.|$|E

2500|$|Two earlier {{versions}} of the poem can be found, the original typescript of the poem {{as well as that}} version with comments by Ezra Pound. In the typescript, the name of the poem is [...] "Gerousia", referring to the name of the Council of the Elders at Sparta. Pound, who was living in London in 1919, acted as Eliot's editor and influenced many of his works. When Eliot considered publishing the poem as the opening part of The Waste Land, Pound discouraged him from doing so saying, [...] "I do not advise printing Gerontion as preface. One don't miss it at all as the thing now stands. To be more lucid still, let me say that I <b>advise</b> <b>you</b> NOT to print Gerontion as prelude." [...] The lines were never added to the text and remained an individual poem.|$|E
2500|$|Irregularities {{surrounding}} {{the appointment of}} the CEO are particularly evident in the confusion shown by AET's own board about if or when the CEO was actually appointed to the permanent post as CEO.

Five months later, on the 27th Feb 2014 Ian Foster, {{the chair of the}} AET board wrote to all staff announcing that the CEO was being made permanent. He stated [...] "It is with great pleasure that I am able to <b>advise</b> <b>you</b> that at its meeting on Tuesday 25th February, the AET board confirmed the appointment of Ian Comfort as permanent Group Chief Executive Officer, following several months as interim CEO" [...] However two months later in April 2014 AET's own website was updated to record the CEO as 'interim' AET board minutes show that even a year later in July 2015 they believe that they need to search for a CEO.|$|E
