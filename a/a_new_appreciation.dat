Marianne cannot resist going to see the estate; she becomes gravely ill {{trekking}} up a hill in a torrential rain. Colonel Brandon finds her in the rain and brings her home. Elinor stays at her side until she recovers, and the sisters return home. Colonel Brandon and Marianne begin spending time together, as Marianne has <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>appreciation</b> for him.

5|$|Meanwhile, Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) and her husband, {{state senator}} Robert (Jack Coleman), welcome their new baby, also named Phillip. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Gabe all visit Angela at the hospital. According to Angela, {{the baby was}} born prematurely, but due to the size, Oscar deduces that Angela lied about the date of conception. Angela admits that the baby was {{conceived}} a month before her wedding, and makes them promise not to tell anyone. Suspecting that Dwight is the real father, Oscar breaks his promise and tells him when he arrives at the hospital in search of Gabe. Dwight barges in on Angela and her husband and begins thoroughly examining the child. When the senator leaves, Dwight confronts Angela about the child, claiming that it is his. She refutes his claim, but Dwight leaves satisfied, telling the attending nurse to call off the baby's circumcision, which the nonplussed nurse refuses to do. Upon returning to Dunder Mifflin he drops his dispute with Jim, since his self-assumed fatherhood has given him <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>appreciation</b> for the duties of parenthood. The episode ends with Dwight putting a decal on his car, in honor of his covert new family member.|$|E

40|$|Seven transmembrane receptors (7 TMRs) exert strong {{regulatory}} {{influences on}} virtually all physiological processes. Although it is historically assumed that heterotrimeric G proteins mediate these actions, there is <b>a</b> <b>newer</b> <b>appreciation</b> that β-arrestins, originally thought only to desensitize G protein signaling, {{also serve as}} independent receptor signal transducers. Recently, we found that activation of ERK 1 / 2 by the angiotensin receptor occurs via both of these distinct pathways. In this work, we explore the physiological consequences of β-arrestin ERK 1 / 2 signaling and delineate a pathway that regulates mRNA translation and protein synthesis via Mnk 1, a protein that both physically interacts with and is activated by β-arrestins. We show that β-arrestin-dependent activation of ERK 1 / 2, Mnk 1, and eIF 4 E are responsible for increasing translation rates in both human embryonic kidney 293 and rat vascular smooth muscle cells. This novel demonstration that β-arrestins regulate protein synthesis reveals that the spectrum of β-arrestin-mediated signaling events is broader than previously imagined...|$|R

25|$|Although toy trains were {{historically}} produced to this scale, O gauge's popularity {{across the}} whole of Europe reduced after World War II, and the standard is rarer than in the United States. Modelling in O gauge in fact almost died out in Britain but enjoyed a resurgence in the 1990s as modellers developed <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>appreciation</b> for the level of accurate detailing possible in this scale. Some ready to run models are produced in this scale but most are available only as kits for assembly by the modeller or a professional model-builder. O gauge is considered an expensive scale to model in although the necessarily smaller scope of a larger-scaled layout mitigates this to some extent. The two dominant British manufacturers, Bassett-Lowke and Hornby, ceased production of O gauge trains in 1965 and 1969, respectively. However, ACE Trains {{and for a while}} a revived Bassett-Lowke are once again producing tinplate O gauge sets, many of them reproductions of classic Hornby and Bassett-Lowke designs, and Heljan also recently joined the market producing O gauge Diesel locomotives.|$|E

25|$|The {{assumption}} of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions {{of what is}} aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>appreciation</b> for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet {{they all seem to}} agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist. Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but {{they do not have to}} do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the human condition; that is, what it is to be human.|$|E

He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>appreciation</b> of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W.

500|$|The {{ecosystem}} engineering {{concept has}} stimulated <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>appreciation</b> for {{the influence that}} organisms have on the ecosystem and evolutionary process. The term [...] "niche construction" [...] is more often used {{in reference to the}} under-appreciated feedback mechanisms of natural selection imparting forces on the abiotic niche. An example of natural selection through ecosystem engineering occurs in the nests of social insects, including ants, bees, wasps, and termites. There is an emergent homeostasis or homeorhesis {{in the structure of the}} nest that regulates, maintains and defends the physiology of the entire colony. Termite mounds, for example, maintain a constant internal temperature through the design of air-conditioning chimneys. The structure of the nests themselves are subject to the forces of natural selection. Moreover, a nest can survive over successive generations, so that progeny inherit both genetic material and a legacy niche that was constructed before their time.|$|E

Gordon W. Allport (1954) is often credited with the development of the contact hypothesis, also known as Intergroup Contact Theory. The premise of Allport's theory states that under appropriate conditions interpersonal contact is one of the most effective ways to reduce prejudice between majority and minority group members.

As <b>a</b> result of <b>new</b> <b>appreciation</b> and understanding, prejudice should diminish.
