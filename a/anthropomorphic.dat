The main {{difference in the}} <b>anthropomorphic</b> form portrayal {{is that the first}} two avatars are depicted with a torso of a man and the bottom half as animal, while Varaha has an animal (boar) head and a human body. The portrayal of the <b>anthropomorphic</b> Varaha is similar to the fourth avatar Narasimha (portrayed as a lion-headed man), who is the first avatar of Vishnu that is not completely animal.|$|E

5|$|As hats {{go out of}} fashion, the <b>anthropomorphic</b> bear Popol the Hatter {{heads into}} the American West with his wife Virginia and blue donkey, Bluebell.

This infuriates the Bunnokee medicine man, whose feather headdress business has declined as a result. He and the Chief of the Bunnokees conspire to eradicate the economic threat, launching war against Popol. Using technology that is more advanced than the Bunnokee's bow and arrows, Popol defeats the rabbits' initial attacks, but they retaliate by abducting Virginia and threatening to torture her. Popol then rescues her, and together they escape, coming upon a river in which they discover gold.|$|E

5|$|In The Orphant Annie Story Book (1921), author Johnny Gruelle augments the character’s {{background}} story {{and goes to}} great lengths to soften her image, portraying her as telling pleasant tales of fairies, gnomes and <b>anthropomorphic</b> animals rather than her characteristic horror stories.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, {{the weapon}} may be {{depicted}} as in both <b>anthropomorphic</b> and their true form. While the central icon of Vishnu {{may hold the}} weapons, the ayudhapurushas of the same weapon may stand {{at the feet of}} the central icon.|$|E

5|$|The idea {{of using}} <b>anthropomorphic</b> furry animals as protagonists in a story set in the American West pre-dated Popol Out West by several years.

Printed in colour, it was serialised in 16 weekly installments, and was aimed to encourage children's interest in the store.|$|E

5|$|Usually, {{the episodes}} {{are focused on}} Adam's {{experiences}} at Charles Darwin Middle School due to his inability {{to fit in with}} his <b>anthropomorphic</b> schoolmates, the challenges that he must face (such as the presumed stupidity of his peers, being schooled in subjects of use only to animals, the introductions of new students of odd, dangerous, or fictional species to the school or the misadventures that Adam stumbles into with them, or the common effects of adolescence as they are experienced by zoo animals).|$|E
5|$|While Hillenburg was there, {{his love}} of the ocean began to {{influence}} his artistry. He created a precursor to SpongeBob SquarePants: a comic book titled The Intertidal Zone, which {{was used by the}} institute to teach visiting students about the animal life of tide pools. The comic starred various <b>anthropomorphic</b> sea lifeforms, many of which would evolve into SpongeBob SquarePants characters. Hillenburg tried to get the comic professionally published, but none of the companies that he sent it to were interested.|$|E
