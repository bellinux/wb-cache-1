The machines can process up to 500 cups an hour, or 1,000 if the water is preheated.|$|E

He's going to work the count <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> any hitter in baseball. Last year if he got a two-strike breaking ball, he might swing and miss.

[...] "If there's a better {{celluloid}} expression of ordinary American freedom than Ferris Bueller's Day Off, I {{have yet to}} see it.

500|$|For his marimba performance, DePonte {{earned a}} Grammy Award {{nomination}} for Best Instrumental Soloist Performance with Orchestra, {{the first time}} that the Oregon Symphony or any of its musicians had been recognized by the Recording Academy. Following the announcement, DePonte admitted that he was surprised by the nomination and had not felt similar emotions since learning of his invitation to join the orchestra 26 years earlier: [...] "I am completely overwhelmed. I had no idea the recording had been submitted." [...] DePriest said: [...] "The credit goes to Mary Tooze for making the recording possible, to Niel for his fine playing and to Tomas for writing such a wonderful piece. I am thrilled for everyone concerned." [...] Svoboda said of the nomination: [...] "The prestige goes to the orchestra. This is a great moment for our symphony." [...] The Oregon Symphony's director of public relations commented: [...] "The running joke is that forever more, the name of this organization is 'The Grammy-nominated Oregon Symphony Orchestra.' The Grammy acknowledgment is recognized as a mark of great artistic achievement. To be nominated is <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> it gets." ...|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club writer Steve Heisler {{said the}} episode was [...] "just <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> it gets", with several great moments {{revolving}} around Nick Offerman's deadpan comedic delivery. Heisler also said making {{the police department}} part of the script {{was a good way}} to better flesh out Pawnee and its townspeople. New York magazine writer Steve Kandell praised the performances of Offerman and Aubrey Plaza, and referred to Tammy as Pawnee's equivalent of Sideshow Bob in The Simpsons Springfield. Kandell also liked that the episode [...] "had heart" [...] because the Tammy subplot was resolved by Ron standing up for Tom. TV Squad writer Joel Keller said the episode did not reach the level of the original [...] "Ron and Tammy", but that [...] "it still had more than enough funny, cringeworthy and downright gross moments to be very satisfying". He declared Mullally [...] "one of the best sitcom creations this side of Colonel Flagg on M*A*S*H". The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow praised Ron Swanson as the show's [...] "breakout character", and said [...] "Ron & Tammy: Part Two" [...] was so good that he hoped for another sequel episode in the next season.|$|E

Videgård wrote, [...] "The outcome is <b>about</b> half <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> Janov claims the results of PT to be," [...] calculating a 40 percent success rate, compared with a 98-100 percent success rate claimed by Janov.|$|R

500|$|... "Rumors" [...] {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, however {{it has become}} one of Lohan's most recognized songs and has now been labeled as [...] "cult pop treasure". Charles Merwin of Stylus Magazine thought that [...] "Rumors" [...] was not a good choice for a single, stating, [...] "in fact, for a girl, that has been tagged as America’s next sweetheart by some media outlets, it might be the worst choice of subject matter for the opening statement from a girl that automatically has more to prove to audiences because of her stature as an actress. Unfortunately, 'Rumors' is <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> it gets." [...] Erik Missio of ChartAttack thought that the song [...] "presented potential for a semi-palatable debut effort", but further added that it is a [...] "crap of a spectularly unspectacular level." [...] Entertainment Weekly contributor Nicholas Fonseca, however, considered [...] "Rumors" [...] a guilty pleasure, while Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic selected the song a Track Pick in the review of Speak. IGN's Spence D. described it as [...] "pervasively infectious, the kind of track that will no doubt keep the dance floors sweaty and steamy for a few months to come." [...] John Murphy of musicOMH praised [...] "Rumors" [...] as a departure from Speaks soft rock genre.|$|E
500|$|Erotica {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it [...] "ambitious" [...] {{and noted that}} Erotica contains some of Madonna's best and most accomplished music. Paul Verna from Billboard considered it her most varied and creatively challenging collection to date. Arion Berger of Rolling Stone praised the album's [...] "cold, remote sound", and wrote that [...] "Erotica is everything Madonna has been denounced for being— meticulous, calculated, domineering and artificial. It accepts those charges and answers with a brilliant record to prove them". NME said: [...] "When Erotica the album is good– i.e. when it's funny, original, lively and, yes, sexy– it's <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> the modern media event gets." [...] J. D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun stated that the most surprising thing on the songs is that they find Madonna singing about love, not about sex. Phil Sutcliffe gave three stars in a review for Q, writing: [...] "The biggest surprise is 'Deeper and Deeper', which could {{be mistaken for a}} bopalong tribute to Kylie. However, the substance of Erotica resides in a range of straight-talking, almost intimate songs based, not on an idea about sex, but on experience of relationships." [...] In a retrospective review in Blender, Tony Power concluded: [...] "That female artists (except Millie Jackson) never come on this strongly makes Erotica shocking and, well, arousing." ...|$|E
500|$|On the film's Rotten Tomatoes listing, 57% {{of critics}} gave the film {{positive}} reviews from {{a total of}} 23 reviews. DVD Authority says [...] "After this one, the other Jaws movies seemed to just not be as good." [...] One review says: [...] "it's obviously not a patch on Spielberg's classic, but it's <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> could be hoped for, with some excellent sequences, almost worthy of the original, several genuine shocks, a different enough story and some pretty decent characters." [...] The performances of Scheider, Gary and Hamilton are particularly praised. George Morris for the Texas Monthly preferred Jaws 2 over the original because it is [...] "less insidious in its methods of manipulation" [...] and [...] "because director Jeannot Szwarc streamlines the terror ... By crosscutting among the teenagers, Scheider, and the officials' efforts to rescue them, Szwarc works up enough suspense to keep the adrenaline going." [...] However, Morris' review is not entirely complimentary. He would have preferred the shark to have been seen less, positing [...] "producers and audiences alike seem to have forgotten that the greatest suspense derives from the unseen and the unknown, and that the imagination is capable of conceiving far worse than the materialization of a mere mechanical monster." [...] Similarly, John Simon felt that the [...] "shark's waning {{is caused by a}} decline in direction: Jeannot Szwarc has none of Steven Spielberg's manipulative cleverness. For one thing, he allows us close and disarming close-ups of the shark almost immediately..."Simon praises Scheider and Hamilton, but is less complimentary about Gary. A reviewer for the BBC complained that the additional screen time awarded to the shark makes it [...] "seems far less terrifying than its almost mystical contemporary". [...] The Radio Times was not pleased with Jaws 2, calling it a [...] "pale imitation of the classic original" [...] and stating that [...] "the suspense comes unglued because the film floats in all-too-familiar waters. You just know how everyone is going to react — from the stars to the director, and even the mechanical shark." ...|$|E

The {{pleasure}} I have had in [...] staying does not make an argument at all; it is a mere expression [...] or anticipation of my desire to be turned out to grass for [...] good....|$|R
500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, {{the pilot was}} viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers. The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Diana Steenbergen of IGN, who was [...] "hooked right away", gave the pilot episode a score of 8.5 out of 10. She felt it began [...] "heartbreakingly", and the [...] "genuinely scary" [...] death scenes of Mary and Jess [...] "will haunt...the viewers". Steenbergen praised both the writers and the lead actors for making the [...] " [...] still feel natural, for the most part", and noted Ackles and Padalecki were [...] "instantly convincing as brothers". Also credited for this [...] "well paced" [...] episode was director David Nutter, who did an [...] "excellent job of setting up the atmosphere and tone of the series". Likewise, BuddyTV's Don Williams posited, [...] "It's <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> a pilot can get." [...] He ranked it ninth out of his favorite episodes {{of the first three}} seasons, believing it introduces the characters [...] "in a memorable fashion" [...] and [...] "wonderfully" [...] establishes the show's universe. Robert Bianco of USA Today deemed the series as possibly [...] "the simplest and the scariest" [...] of the season's new dark shows, and wrote, [...] "It wants nothing more than to frighten you — and tonight, it does." [...] He noted the episode [...] " [...] off a few surprises" [...] and [...] "works its way to an ending that lives up to Dean's 'no chick-flick moments'". However, Bianco criticized the [...] "pauses for comic relief"; he felt Ackles' [...] "comic touch" [...] was [...] "not yet as skillful as it needs to be", with Ackles' attempts at being [...] "humorously annoying" [...] leaving him [...] "simply annoying". Despite the episode having a somewhat unoriginal villain and a [...] "relatively simple" [...] solution, Brian Lowry of Variety deemed the series' debut as [...] "a promising plunge into the darkness". Lowry applauded Ackles, who [...] "brings an easygoing charm and engaging wise-ass personality to the absurd notion of traveling the country with a trunk full of wooden stakes and holy water".|$|E
2500|$|All for You {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic favored All for You over her last studio album, The Velvet Rope, calling it [...] "alluring, easily enveloping the listener." [...] Erlewine added, [...] "This is her sexiest-sounding record, thanks to Jam and Lewis' silky groove and her breathy delivery, {{two things that}} make the record palatable." [...] Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a 'B' rating, saying, [...] "Despite a few missteps, All for You is <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> modern diva-pop gets, with a higher ratio of worthy-to-mediocre songs than might be expected... it {{adds up to a}} lot more than most female singers have done for us lately." ...|$|E
2500|$|Entertainment Weekly later named Bionic {{the fifth}} worst album of 2010 in a year-end list. The album was named by Billboard the [...] "best {{mainstream}} pop {{album of the}} year thus far" [...] upon its release. Sam Lansky wrote for MTV Buzzworthy that the album was [...] "precociously brilliant" [...] and [...] "how thrilling most those songs are", claiming that [...] "the songs on the deluxe edition are forward-thinking and even timeless, galactic pop with subversive, ambient production." [...] Lansky noted that [...] "In its own way, Bionic neatly illustrates the dangers artists face when aggressively {{trying to keep up with}} 'current' music. As a result, futuristic pop tracks can already sound dated by the time they're released. And even when they don't, those chart-chasing songs don't age particularly gracefully. But two years after the fact, Bionic's moments of greatness remain <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> it gets." [...] In similar vein, Mike Wass of Idolator wrote that [...] "the album holds up better than expected, and is actually an intriguing — if somewhat disjointed and often meandering — collection of songs. Christina's assertion that she was ahead of the curve is inarguably correct." [...] Wass acknowledged that Aguilera [...] "was the first mainstream artist to call on Australian singer-songwriter Sia, who has since been courted by everyone from Adam Lambert to Rihanna." ...|$|E

While Cramer played for BYU, April Heinrich, Cramer's national team coach, defined Cramer as,"The most impactful player in women's college soccer today...She changed the game. At 19-years-of-age, that's <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> a compliment <b>as</b> you'll get from me without calling her the next Michael Jordan." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{book has}} also {{received}} extensive review {{coverage in the}} science fiction and fantasy genre magazines. Galaxy reviewer Floyd C. Gale praised the novel as [...] "tender, funny, and wise, <b>about</b> <b>as</b> different (and <b>good)</b> <b>as</b> a 'ghost' story can be." [...] Reviewing a mid-1970s reissue, Richard A. Lupoff described it as [...] "a marvelous fantasy[...] [...] [...] funny, gentle, tender, and profound." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the preface}} to the book, Huxley {{describes}} how, {{at the age of}} sixteen, he had a violent attack of keratitis punctata which made him nearly completely blind for eighteen months, and left him thereafter with severely impaired sight. He managed to live as a sighted person with the aid of strong spectacles, but reading, in particular, was a great strain. In 1939 his ability to read became increasingly degraded, and he sought the help of Margaret Corbett, who was a teacher of the Bates method. He found this immensely helpful, and wrote “At the present time, my vision, though very far from normal, is <b>about</b> twice <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> it used to be when I wore spectacles, and before I had learned the art of seeing”.|$|R

The investigators compared a, [...] "first-generation antipsychotic, perphenazine, with several newer drugs in a double-blind study". [...] "Probably the biggest surprise of all was that the older medication produced <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> an effect <b>as</b> the newer medications, three of them anyway, and did not produce neurological side effects at greater rates {{than any of the}} other drugs," [...] Lieberman told The New York Times.|$|R
5000|$|Alan Sepinwall from HitFix has {{praised the}} episode, saying, [...] "As an episode, [...] "How Your Mother Met Me" [...] was pretty terrific. I can quibble {{with a couple}} of things here and there — they were stuck with Darren, for instance, even though I'd have been fine never seeing him again — but overall it did <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> a job <b>as</b> {{possible}} as a single episode could at both telling a story of the Mother's last seven years, while weaving her into the larger continuity of the series.

5000|$|Both the {{original}} Japanese and American {{version of the}} film were released on home video in 2007 by Classic Media. Bonus features on the disc include an audio commentary by David Kalat, a biography on Eiji Tsuburaya and galleries of images and promotional material. Slant Magazine commented that the image quality on the DVD was clear, [...] "but unremarkable" [...] as [...] "dust and dirt is evident throughout but one imagines this is <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> a transfer <b>as</b> we're going to get with a film of this sort." ...|$|R

2500|$|In a September 1966 {{review of}} Revolver, KRLA Beat {{said that the}} title of Rubber Soul had [...] "become a {{standard}} phrase used to describe a creation of exceptional excellence {{in the field of}} music", such that several highly regarded releases had since earned the description [...] "a Rubber Soul in its field'". Writing in Esquire in 1967, Robert Christgau called it [...] "an album that for innovation, tightness, and lyrical intelligence was <b>about</b> twice <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> anything they or anyone else (except maybe the Stones) had done previously". He later wrote: [...] "Rubber Soul smashed a lot of alienation. Without reneging on the group's masscult appeal, it reached into private lives and made hundreds of thousands of secretly lonely people feel as if someone out there shared their brightest insights and most depressing discoveries … Psychedelia starts here." ...|$|R
50|$|The plasma {{confinement}} {{in the best}} RFP's is only <b>about</b> 1% <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> in the best tokamaks. One {{reason for this is}} that all existing RFP's are relatively small. MST was larger than any previous RFP device, and thus it tested this important size issue.http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/mstfaq.htm.The RFP is believed to require a shell with high electrical conductivity very close to the boundary of the plasma. This requirement is an unfortunate complication in a reactor. The Madison Symmetric Torus was designed to test this assumption and to learn how good the conductor must be and how close to the plasma it must be placed. In RFX, the thick shell was replaced with an active system of 192 coils, which cover the entire torus with their saddle shape, and response to the magnetic push of the plasma. Active control of plasma modes is also possible with this system.|$|R
