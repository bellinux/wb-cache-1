5|$|Antibodies are glycoproteins {{belonging}} to the immunoglobulin superfamily. They constitute most of the gamma globulin fraction of the blood proteins. They are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains that define the five different types of crystallisable fragments (Fc) that may {{be attached to the}} antigen-binding fragments. The five different types of Fc regions allow antibodies to be grouped into five isotypes. Each Fc region of a particular antibody isotype is able to bind to its specific Fc Receptor (except for IgD, which is essentially the BCR), thus allowing the <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complex</b> to mediate different roles depending on which FcR it binds. The ability of an antibody to bind to its corresponding FcR is further modulated by the structure of the glycan(s) present at conserved sites within its Fc region. The ability of antibodies to bind to FcRs helps to direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. For example, IgE is responsible for an allergic response consisting of mast cell degranulation and histamine release. IgE's Fab paratope binds to allergic antigen, for example house dust mite particles, while its Fc region binds to Fc receptor ε. The allergen-IgE-FcRε interaction mediates allergic signal transduction to induce conditions such as asthma.|$|E
25|$|The {{liquid phase}} ligand binding assay of Immunoprecipitation (IP) {{is a method}} {{that is used to}} purify or enrich a {{specific}} protein, or a group of proteins, using an antibody from a complex mixture. The extract of disrupted tissue or cells is mixed with an antibody against the antigen of interest, which produces the <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complex.</b> When antigen concentration is low, the <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complex</b> precipitation can take hours or even days and becomes hard to isolate the small amount of precipitate formed.|$|E
25|$|If the {{antibody}} is crosslinking {{and bound}} to the cells at 0 °C, the distribution of antibodies has a patchy appearance.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} that <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complexes</b> dissociate at low pH while IgG aggregates do not, {{and it has been}} suggested that dissociation of high molecular weight IgG in serum at low pH supports the presence of circulating <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complexes.</b> Our studies confirm the observation that heat-aggregated IgG does not dissociate at low pH. By contrast, non-thermal IgG aggregates, formed in isolated IgG preparations or in hypoalbuminemic serum and which may also form in vivo, are almost totally dissociated at low pH. Consequently dissociation of high molecular weight IgG in serum at low pH does not distinguish <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complexes</b> from IgG aggregates...|$|R
40|$|The immune {{elimination}} of soluble BSA, following an intravenous injection, {{is accompanied by}} the appearance of circulating <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complexes.</b> The pattern of the appearance of circulating <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complexes</b> and the immune {{elimination of}} antigen probably depends on the amount of antigen injected, the rate of antibody synthesis, and perhaps, the quality of antibody produced. There is no relationship between the I* <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complexes</b> detected during the immune response in rabbits by ammonium sulfate precipitation and the material precipitated from immune sera as a result of treatment with alkali.

We {{found that the}} only B cells capable of {{efficient}} presentation of <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complexes</b> are those that bind the complexes via membrane immunoglobulin, i. e., rheumatoid factor-producing B cells and, to a lower extent, antigen-specific B cells. On the contrary, nonspecific B cells, although capable of binding <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complexes,</b> fail to present them to T cells. Thus, rheumatoid factor B cells can present any antigen {{in the context of}} an immune complex and be triggered by T cells specific for a variety of foreign antigens.

50|$|In {{biological}} fluids, antibodies and antigens {{are in a}} {{state of}} dynamic equilibrium between bound and unbound forms that is concentration-dependent. As antigen masks the antibody, it obstructs accurate measurement of antibody-antigen detection. Dr. Gustow discovered a novel way to enhance antibody-antigen detection. Using a dissociation buffer (1.5% bovine serume albumin (BSA) and 0.2M glycine HCl pH2/5), he dissociated <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complexes.</b> As shown in the figure below, in dissociated samples, unbound <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complexes</b> reveal increased disease state compared to non-diseased state.|$|R

The amount of radioactive remaining in the solution is direct function of the antigen concentration.|$|E
50|$|Antigen-antibody interaction, or antigen-antibody reaction, is a {{specific}} chemical interaction between antibodies produced by B cells of the white blood cells and antigens during immune reaction. It is the fundamental reaction in the body by which the body is protected from complex foreign molecules, such as pathogens and their chemical toxins. In the blood, the antigens are specifically and with high affinity bound by antibodies to form an <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complex.</b> The immune complex is then transported to cellular systems {{where it can be}} destroyed or deactivated.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{antisera}} to suppress immune responses either in vivo or in vitro is well known. A variety of lymphocyte-target cell {{systems have been}} employed to demonstrate inhibition of cell-mediated immunity by antisera in vitro, and skin, tumor, and kidney graft survival have been prolonged by passively administered antiserum in vivo. An in vitro lymphocyte-tumor cell assay system was developed {{for the purpose of}} studying the effects of enhancing antisera (in vivo) on lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro. The characteristics of this system with respect to route of immunization, time of harvest of immune cells, lymphocyte:tumor cell ratio, and effect of nonimmune or nonspecifically immune lymphoid cells are presented. Sera capable of enhancement in vivo were tested in this system and shown to inhibit cell-mediated immunity in vitro. Further, in both instances the immunosuppressive effect is mediated by <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complexes</b> and not by free antibody alone. Experiments were also carried out to determine the site of action of these suppressive <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complexes.</b> Presensitized lymphocytes were exposed to <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complexes,</b> washed, and then allowed to interact with fresh tumor cells (not antibody treated). Lymphocytes treated in this manner are incapable of exhibiting cell-mediated immunity in vitro. This evidence supports the concept that the <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complexes</b> have a direct immunosuppressive effect on the lymphocyte...|$|R
40|$|When soluble <b>antigen—antibody</b> <b>complexes,</b> {{prepared}} in antigen excess, were {{injected into the}} perfused pulmonary artery of the unsensitized guinea-pig lung, they produced a bronchoconstrictor response which {{was associated with the}} appearance of histamine and a slow-reacting substance in the effluent. This activity was inhibited by the presence of normal rabbit serum or rabbit globulin; rabbit albumin and bovine γ-globulin produced no inhibition. Insoluble <b>antigen—antibody</b> <b>complexes</b> prepared at equivalence were at least 125 times less active than soluble complexes {{prepared in}} antigen excess. On comparing the activity of different solutions of soluble complex prepared in antigen excess ranging from 2 ½ to 160 times that required for equivalence, all were found to be equal. The properties of soluble <b>antigen—antibody</b> <b>complexes</b> are consistent with the possibility that circulating antibody may participate in in vivo anaphylaxis, if reached by an amount of antigen greater than that required for equivalence...|$|R

50|$|An immune complex, {{sometimes}} called an <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complex,</b> is a molecule formed from the integral binding of an antibody to a soluble antigen. The bound antigen and antibody {{act as a}} unitary object, effectively an antigen of its own with a specific epitope. After an antigen-antibody reaction, the immune complexes can be subject to any {{of a number of}} responses, including complement deposition, opsonization, phagocytosis, or processing by proteases. Red blood cells carrying CR1-receptors on their surface may bind C3b-coated immune complexes and transport them to phagocytes, mostly in liver and spleen, and return to the general circulation.|$|E
50|$|This gene encodes the acidic form of {{complement}} factor 4, {{part of the}} classical activation pathway. The protein is expressed as a single chain precursor which is proteolytically cleaved into a trimer of alpha, beta, and gamma chains prior to secretion. The trimer provides a surface for interaction between the <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complex</b> and other complement components. The alpha chain may be cleaved to release C4 anaphylatoxin, a mediator of local inflammation. Deficiency of this protein is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and type I diabetes mellitus. This gene localizes to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region on chromosome 6. Varying haplotypes of this gene cluster exist, such that individuals may have 1, 2, or 3 copies of this gene.|$|E
5000|$|Antibodies {{are part}} of the {{adaptive}} immune response and are generated by B cells in response to antigen exposure. The Fab region of the antibody binds to the antigen, whereas the Fc region of the antibody binds to an Fc receptor on the phagocyte, facilitating phagocytosis. [...] The <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complex</b> can also activate complement through the classical complement pathway. Phagocytic cells do not have an Fc receptor for immunoglobulin M (IgM), making IgM ineffective in assisting phagocytosis alone. However, IgM is extremely efficient at activating complement and is, therefore, considered an opsonin. IgG antibodies are also capable of binding immune effector cells via their Fc domain, triggering a release of lysis products from the bound immune effector cell (monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and natural killer cells). This process, called antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, can cause inflammation of surrounding tissues and damage to healthy cells.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} types of apparent receptor sites have been demonstrated on the surface membrane of lymphocytes. These include immunoglobulin receptors for a variety of antigens (1), a receptor for the C 3 component of complement (2), and a possible receptor site for the Fc portion of the immunoglobulin molecule through which antibody alone or <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complexes</b> adhere to mouse lymphocytes (3, 4). Attempts in the present study to demonstrate such a receptor for <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complexes</b> on human lymphocytes using fluorescein-labeled antigen or antibody presented a number of difficulties with different <b>complexes.</b> One particular <b>antigen-antibody</b> system consistently labeled a population of lymphocytes while several other systems were completely negative.

40|$|Acute, subacute, {{and chronic}} glomerulonephritis, similar in certain {{features}} to human glomerulonephritis, has been produced in rabbits by repeated injections of bovine serum albumin. The ratio of antigen to antibody was the factor determining {{the development and}} type of glomerulonephritis. This is in confirmation of the observations of Dixon, Feldman, and Vazquez.

40|$|Summary. -Antibodies to the tumour-specific {{transplantation}} type antigen (TSTA) of a transplanted methylcholanthrene-induced sarcoma (MC- 1) in syngeneic rats {{were studied}} using {{the techniques of}} indirect membrane immunofluorescence and mixed haemadsorption with a 5 'Cr-labelled indicator cell. After tumour excision, anti-TSTA antibody was readily measurable in both serum and lymph. In contrast, the tumour-bearing animal had no measurable anti-TSTA antibody in the serum but low titres in the lymph. Consequently, we formed the hypothesis that {{in the presence of}} a growing tumour the serum contained <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complexes</b> with antigen in excess. To test this hypothesis, tumour-bearing serum was examined for the presence of free antigen and <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complexes</b> by 2 different methods. In the first method, tumour-bearing serum was cross-linked with glutaraldehyde and was found to absorb specifically the anti-TSTA antibody, indicating free circulating TSTA.

The response to the T-cell mitogen, concanavalin A, is also substantially inhibited by immobilized <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complexes,</b> but specific inhibition of the response to phytohemagglutinin is minimal. Control experiments showed that immobilized complexes prepared from IgG F(ab') 2 fragments and IgA antibodies (both of which fail to bind to Fc receptors when complexed to antigen) did not show significant inhibitory activity {{when compared with the}} inhibition observed with complexes prepared from whole IgG. Suspensions of <b>antigen-antibody</b> <b>complexes</b> prepared from the same antigen and intact IgG antibody did not inhibit mitogenesis. None of the mitogens used could be demonstrated to compete with the binding of aggregated immunoglobulin to the B-cell Fc receptor.

40|$|Recently much {{attention}} has been given to the classification of leukemia according to B- and T-cell origins. Wilson and Nossal (1) indicated that acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) t might be a leukemia of T cells and chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) might be that of B cells. Since Iwakata and Grace (2) succeeded in the permanent culture of a hematopoietic cell line from the peripheral blood of a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia, many cell lines were successfully established.
