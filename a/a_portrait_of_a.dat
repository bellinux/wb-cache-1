5|$|The actual {{origin of}} a breed {{as old as}} the Scottish Terrier is obscure and undocumented. The first written records about a dog of similar {{description}} to the Scottish Terrier dates from 1436, when Don Leslie described them in his book The History of Scotland 1436–1561. Two hundred years later, Sir Joshua Reynolds painted <b>a</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> young girl caressing a dog similar in appearance to the modern-day Scottie. King James VI of Scotland was an important historical figure featuring in the Scottish Terrier's history. In the 17th century, when King James VI became James I of England, he sent six terriers—thought to be forerunners of the Scottish terrier—to a French monarch as a gift. His love and adoration for the breed increased their popularity throughout the world.|$|E

25|$|Much of Augustine's {{later life}} was {{recorded}} {{by his friend}} Possidius, bishop of Calama (present-day Guelma, Algeria), in his Sancti Augustini Vita.

25|$|While the Pre-Raphaelites had a {{turbulent}} and divided reception, {{the most popular}} and expensive painters of the period included Edwin Landseer, who specialized in sentimental animal subjects, which were favourites of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. In the later part of the century artists could earn large sums from selling the reproduction rights of their paintings to print publishers, and works of Landseer, especially his Monarch of the Glen (1851), <b>a</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Highland stag, were among the most popular. Like Millais' Bubbles (1886) it was used on packaging and advertisements for decades, for brands of whisky and soap respectively.|$|E

25|$|Isabella d’Este {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a plausible candidate for Leonardo’s ‘Mona Lisa’ of 1502-06, which is usually considered a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo. (Lisa was {{the wife of a}} merchant in Florence and Giorgio Vasari wrote of her portrait by Leonardo– it remains open whether this is the portrait now known as the ‘Mona Lisa’.) Evidence in favor of Isabella as the subject of the famous work includes Leonardo’s drawing ‘Isabella d’Este’ from 1499 and her letters of 1501-06 requesting the promised painted portrait; further arguments are the mountains in the background and the armrest as a Renaissance symbol for <b>a</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sovereign.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} hadith and other {{writings}} of the early Islamic period include stories in which portraits of Muhammad appear. Abu Hanifa Dinawari, Ibn al-Faqih, Ibn Wahshiyya and Abu Nu`aym tell versions of a story in which the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius is visited by two Meccans. He shows them a cabinet, handed down to him from Alexander the Great and originally created by God for Adam, each of whose drawers contains <b>a</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prophet. They are astonished to see a portrait of Muhammad in the final drawer. Sadid al-Din al-Kazaruni tells a similar story in which the Meccans are visiting the king of China. Kisa'i tells that God did indeed give portraits of the prophets to Adam.|$|E
25|$|His {{paintings}} are mostly portraits or half-length groups of religious figures. He painted a live Sparrowhawk(National Gallery, London), {{which is probably}} a fragment of a larger work. The very early still-life of a Partridge, gauntlets, and crossbow bolt (Alte Pinakothek, Munich) is often called the first small scale trompe l'oeil painting since antiquity; it {{may well have been}} the cover or reverse of a portrait (however, a fragmentary panel by another Venetian, Vittorio Carpaccio, has a trompe l'oeil letter-rack of about 1490 on the reverse). In the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin there is <b>a</b> <b>Portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> German Man and a religious subject. The Louvre has a religious group, and Philadelphia a pair of figures.|$|E

25|$|Effi Briest was Fassbinder's dream {{film and}} {{the one in which}} he {{invested}} the most work. While he normally took between nine and 20 days to make a film, this time it required 58 shooting days, dragged out over two years. The film is a period piece adapted from Theodor Fontane's classic novel of 1894, concerning the consequences of betrayed love. Set in the closed, repressive Prussian society of the Bismarck era, the film paints <b>a</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman's fate completely linked to an unbending and utterly unforgiving code of social behavior. The plot follows the story of Effi Briest, a young woman who seeks to escape her stifling marriage to a much older man by entering into a brief affair with a charming soldier. Six years later, Effi's husband discovers her affair with tragic consequences.|$|E
25|$|Paxman's first book, A Higher Form of Killing (1982), {{written with}} then BBC {{colleague}} and friend Robert Harris, arose {{out of an}} edition of the Panorama programme they had made together on biological and chemical warfare. In a revised 2002 version they asserted that Iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons. In 1985, Paxman published Through the Volcanoes: A Central American Journey, an eyewitness account of people, places and politics. Friends in High Places: Who Runs Britain? (1991) {{was the result of}} numerous detailed interviews with the powerful or highly influential, {{what used to be called}} The Establishment. 1999 saw the publication of his The English: <b>A</b> <b>Portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> People. The Political Animal: An Anatomy (2003), again based on extensive interviews, examines the motivations and methods of those who constitute the author's professional prey: Westminster politicians.|$|E

25|$|As {{earlier with}} Perugino and others, Raphael {{was able to}} {{assimilate}} the influence of Florentine art, whilst keeping his own developing style. Frescos in Perugia of about 1505 show a new monumental quality in the figures which may represent the influence of Fra Bartolomeo, who Vasari says {{was a friend of}} Raphael. But the most striking influence in the work of these years is Leonardo da Vinci, who returned to the city from 1500 to 1506. Raphael's figures begin to take more dynamic and complex positions, and though as yet his painted subjects are still mostly tranquil, he made drawn studies of fighting nude men, one of the obsessions of the period in Florence. Another drawing is <b>a</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> young woman that uses the three-quarter length pyramidal composition of the just-completed Mona Lisa, but still looks completely Raphaelesque. Another of Leonardo's compositional inventions, the pyramidal Holy Family, was repeated in a series of works that remain among his most famous easel paintings. There is a drawing by Raphael in the Royal Collection of Leonardo's lost Leda and the Swan, from which he adapted the contrapposto pose of his own Saint Catherine of Alexandria. He also perfects his own version of Leonardo's sfumato modelling, to give subtlety to his painting of flesh, and develops the interplay of glances between his groups, which are much less enigmatic than those of Leonardo. But he keeps the soft clear light of Perugino in his paintings.|$|E
25|$|The portal is {{a simple}} arch with subtle reliefs with small angels, cherubs and {{vegetative}} motifs on the archivolt as well as portraits of saints and friars. One of these portraits may be Jorge de Avile y Ro, {{the founder of the}} monastery. On the left side there is <b>a</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lay person with a Roman style haircut, who was probably the architect. The wooden doorjambs are decorated with the heads of angels and rose patterns as well as vegetative motifs. The bars on the main doors were added in 1910 by Father Evaristo Nava, who also donated the clock that can be seen on the complex’s back tower. Around the arch and the doors, the portal is sculpted in both a detailed and subtle way. To the side of the doorway, there are two pairs of pilasters. These are in Renaissance style {{while the rest of the}} portal mixes Gothic and Plateresque. However, the columns also have channels which are more often associated with the later Churrigueresque. At the base of the columns there are busts of Saint Ambrose, bishop of Milan and Cicero, who was an influence on the philosophy of Saint Augustine. The pilasters are topped with capitals, which support a frieze that contains reliefs of small angels flying with a cross in the center. Above the frieze, there is a panel with a niche, today empty, flanked by the coats of arms of the Augustinians and the Franciscans. Underneath the coats of arms, there is an angel riding a dragon. Topping this is a pediment.|$|E
