25|$|The Americans had {{a strong}} {{pitching}} staff, led by Cy Young, who went 28–9 in 1903 and became the all-time wins leader that year. Bill Dinneen and Long Tom Hughes, right-handers like Young, had won 21 games and 20 games each. The Boston outfield, featuring Chick Stahl (.274), Buck Freeman (.287, 104 RBIs) <b>and</b> <b>Patsy</b> Dougherty (.331, 101 runs scored) was considered excellent.|$|E
25|$|Following stage {{success in}} Hollywood, McVeagh moved to New York City in her 20s, {{performing}} {{on radio and}} on Broadway in several productions including the roles of Martha in Snafu (1944–1945) <b>and</b> <b>Patsy</b> Laverne in Too Hot for Maneuvers (1945). After the well received Broadway run of Snafu, McVeagh took over the female lead at The National Theater in Washington DC in 1945.|$|E

25|$|A {{proposed}} American remake {{that would}} have starred Carrie Fisher and Barbara Carrera was put into motion by Roseanne Barr but never got off the ground. However, Barr did incorporate many elements of the show into the final season of her eponymous show Roseanne, in which her character wins the lottery: Saunders and Lumley reprised their characters Edina <b>and</b> <b>Patsy,</b> and Mo Gaffney also appeared in the episode, but not as her character Bo. Two later American sitcoms, Cybill and High Society, also adapted elements of Absolutely Fabulous for the American audience.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the following year, she again reprised her role in Tell Me on a Sunday, first for a limited run before the closure of the show in the West End and subsequently on tour. The show had been substantially rewritten for a production starring Denise Van Outen, but a combination of the new and original scores was created specifically for Webb. She appeared in many of the principal venues on the tour, but in other locations the show was performed by Faye Tozer <b>and</b> <b>Patsy</b> Palmer.|$|E
25|$|In April 2009, {{the media}} {{confirmed}} that EastEnders bosses were reintroducing {{the character of}} Sam Mitchell, and that Danniella Westbrook would be reprising the role, not Kim Medcalf. Producers reportedly opted for Westbrook to return over Medcalf because of her established on-screen chemistry with actors Sid Owen (who played Sam's former husband Ricky Butcher in the 1990s) <b>and</b> <b>Patsy</b> Palmer (who played Ricky's second wife Bianca Jackson). Westbrook returned to screens in September 2009 for two temporary stints, departing once again on 21 September 2010. Westbrook reprised her role as Sam for four episodes airing between 30 June and 8 July 2016.|$|E

The supporting cast included Raymond Edward Johnson, Bill Johnstone and Bryna Raeburn. Michael Fitzmaurice was the program's announcer. The series ended on September 25, 1955.|$|R
25|$|Also in this election, Democrat Shirley Chisholm {{became the}} first black person to run for a major party nomination, <b>and</b> <b>Patsy</b> Mink was the first Asian {{candidate}} to run for the Democratic Party candidacy. It was also the first time that Hawaii was carried by a Republican. Together with the House and Senate elections of 1972, it was the first electoral event in which people aged 18 to 20 could vote in every state, according to the provisions of the 26th Amendment. It was also the first election in which California had the most votes in the electoral college and it has remained the most populous state since then.|$|E
25|$|Trained in the 1970s in Neuro-Linguistic Programming by Richard Bandler (Hartmann is {{licensed}} by Bandler's Society of NLP as both an NLP Practitioner and an NLP Trainer, and Bandler wrote the foreword to his book Healing ADD), Hartmann popularized {{some of its}} concepts in Cracking the Code (2007), which argues that Newt Gingrich and Frank Luntz made use {{of them in the}} 1980s and 1990s for Republican Party causes and advocates using them to advance liberalism. His book Healing ADD also leans heavily on NLP techniques. Co-authored with Lamar Waldron, Hartmann's Ultimate Sacrifice released in 2005 states that the Mafia ordered the assassination of John F. Kennedy and that Lee Harvey Oswald was a CIA agent <b>and</b> <b>patsy.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the special}} election, Djou {{received}} 39.4 {{percent of the}} vote. He defeated five Democrats, four Republicans, and four independent candidates. Among the candidates Djou defeated were former Congressman Ed Case and State Senator Colleen Hanabusa, two Democrats who together polled over 58% of the vote. Djou was sworn in three days later and was in office {{for the remainder of}} Abercrombie's 2008 term. He was the first Republican to represent the district in 20 years. Djou joined Neil Abercrombie <b>and</b> <b>Patsy</b> Mink as the third person to have been in the Honolulu City Council, Hawaii State Legislature and U.S. Congress, and {{he was the first to}} be elected to all three chambers before age 40.|$|E

25|$|Florance {{continued}} {{working in}} theatre, although she spent less time there. She produced well-regarded work and was nominated {{a second time}} for the Melbourne Critics Award (Erik) for her performance in Eugène Ionesco's The Chairs (1960) at the Little Theatre. By 1961, Florance had left Channel 2 to concentrate on repertory. A string of performances at the Union Theatre followed; including Ferenc Molnár's comedy The Guardsman (4 September 1961 – 23 September 1961), William Inge's The Dark at the Top of the Stairs (25 September 1961 – 14 October 1961), and Bram Stoker's Dracula (8 January 1962 – 3 February 1962) with Neil Fitzpatrick <b>and</b> <b>Patsy</b> King, who later appeared with Florance in many episodes of Prisoner.|$|E

Tony arrives back home and, hearing about the hits, orders his family to go into hiding. Carmela and Meadow visit the Baccalieris, who are all in shock over Bobby's death. At nightfall, Tony, Paulie, Carlo, and Dante Greco drive to an old suburban safe house. Tony goes upstairs to get some sleep, clutching the AR-10 assault rifle that Bobby gave him for his birthday.|$|E

In May 2010, Madoff's penthouse at 133 East 64th Street in Manhattan was sold to Al <b>and</b> <b>Patsy</b> Kahn for $8 million, a markdown from the original asking price of $9.9 million and the reduced listing price of $8.9 million.|$|E

60|$|Watson {{could not}} {{recognize}} himself, nor could his worst enemy have recognized him, in the swashbuckling, rough-housing picture that was painted of him. But, {{as in all}} cases of complicated perjury, rifts and contradictions in the various stories appeared. The Judge somehow failed to notice them, while the Prosecuting Attorney <b>and</b> <b>Patsy's</b> attorney shied off from them gracefully. Watson had not bothered to get a lawyer for himself, and he was now glad that he had not.|$|R
25|$|He {{reached the}} semi-finals of the World Snooker Championship in 1978, {{at the age}} of 64, having {{defeated}} John Virgo 9–8, Dennis Taylor 13–9 <b>and</b> <b>Patsy</b> Fagan 13–10. His defeat by South African Perrie Mans saw Davis miss a crucial pink from its spot on the verge of pulling up to one frame behind at 15–16. This incident is of great note as his brother Joe was following each ball intently, swaying in his seat and almost falling into the gangway when his brother missed this key pot. After this frame Joe Davis was taken ill; he was rushed to hospital to undergo a six-and-a-half-hour operation, and died a few weeks later. So dramatic was the missed pink that it became known as 'the ball that killed Joe Davis'. Davis closed 1978 with a quarter-final appearance in the United Kingdom Professional Championship. He defeated veteran Yorkshireman John Dunning 9–2 before losing to Alex Higgins 9–4.|$|E

500|$|Lee's {{career was}} overshadowed by more attractive, faster-scoring batsmen in the team, such as Hearne <b>and</b> <b>Patsy</b> Hendren.

All three brothers scored centuries during the 1931 season, the first instance of three professional brothers doing so in first-class cricket. Two years later, all three were involved in a single dismissal: Harry was caught by Frank off the bowling of Jack in a county match. At {{the time of his death}} in 1981, Lee was the second-oldest living Test cricketer.|$|E
