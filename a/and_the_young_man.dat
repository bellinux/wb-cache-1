Beauchamp {{gradually}} gained Cooke's trust by visiting {{under the guise of}} borrowing books from her library. By summer 1821, the two became friends and began a courtship. Beauchamp was eighteen; Cooke was at least thirty-four. As the courtship progressed, Cooke told Beauchamp that, before they could be married, he would have to kill Solomon Sharp. Beauchamp agreed to her request, expressing his own desire to dispatch Sharp.|$|E
5|$|The {{remainder}} of Night describes Eliezer's efforts {{not to be}} parted from his father, not even {{to lose sight of}} him; his grief and shame at witnessing his father's decline into helplessness; and as their relationship changes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> becomes the older man's caregiver, his resentment and guilt, because his father's existence threatens his own. The stronger Eliezer's need to survive, the weaker the bonds that tie him to other people.|$|E

25|$|Sonnet 35 {{deals with}} the speaker being angry with the young man for an {{apparent}} betrayal through infidelity. The apparent homoeroticism between the speaker <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> has spurred debates about the sexuality of the speaker and consequently Shakespeare himself. There are 3 main points to discuss with this issue: the problem of ambiguity in the writing, the possibility of applying an anachronistic view of love and consequently mistaking these sonnets homoerotic, and finally the implications of Shakespeare's life and homosexual tendencies.|$|E
25|$|According to updated {{reference}} works, {{the future}} Ion Buzdugan {{was born in}} 1887 in Brînzenii Noi (now in Telenești District, Moldova), the son of peasants Alexandru and Ecaterina Buzdâga, who also had two daughters. One 1936 entry claims that {{he was born in}} 1889 in Buzdugeni. Both villages were at the time included in the Russian Empire's Bessarabian Governorate, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> was educated at a teachers' seminary in Bayramcha. He later studied agriculture, law and literature in Russian schools in Kamianets-Podilskyi and Moscow. He took a license to practice law from Moscow University.|$|E
25|$|The {{context of}} the sonnets vary, but the first 126, amongst which sonnet 54 is found, are {{addressed}} {{to a young man}} of good social status and profess the narrator's platonic love. The love is returned, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> seems to yearn for the sonnets, as seen in sonnets 100-103 where the narrator apologizes for the long silence. However, Berryman suggests {{that it is impossible to}} determine how the relationship ended up. While theories exist that the sonnets were written as literary exercises, H. C. Beeching suggests that they were written for a patron and not originally intended to be published together.|$|E

For example, young women are {{encouraged}} to throw their handkerchiefs to the crowd, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> who catches and returns the handkerchief has a chance at romance. In Daguang, in northeast Guizhou Province, young {{men and women of the}} Dong people would make an appointment at a certain place. The young women would arrive early to overhear remarks made about them by the young men. The young men would praise their lovers in front of their fellows, in which finally the listening women would walk out of the thicket. Pairs of lovers would go off to a quiet place to open their hearts to each other.|$|E
25|$|Bournonville {{must have}} had the folk songs Elveskud (The Elf-shot) and Elvehøj (The Elves' Hill) {{in mind when he}} has Junker Ove linger at the hill after lunch with Miss Birthe, his fiancée, only to dream of another - a {{beautiful}} and gentle Hilda, the counter-image of Birthe. It is always at this point - the moment of doubt before a wedding - that the elves appear. For the young man in the folksong Elveskud, the encounter proves fatal. He refuses to dance with the elf girl and her punishment is so harsh that he dies. He is laid in his grave on his wedding day, followed by his fiancée and his mother. In Elvehøj, which is of a later date than Elveskud, it is God who has human fate in his hands. He lets the cock crow at dawn <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> who had slept by the hill, wakes from his spell (which turns out to have been a dream) and he counts himself lucky. The manager of the Royal Theatre, J.L. Heiberg - who Bournonville fell out with on numerous occasions during this period because he thought that Heiberg was trying to drive the ballet off the stage - had experienced great success with his Elvehøj, which in Biedermeier style, lets the elves' dance dissolve into dream and delusion.|$|E
500|$|Still {{eager to}} be {{initiated}} into a Pagan Witchcraft, or Wiccan, tradition, Buczsynki began contacting various covens requesting initiation, including the Gardnerian Wiccan coven run in Louisville, Kentucky by Fran and Gerry Fisher and the Algard Wiccan coven that had been founded by Mary Nesnick; the former refused due to the long-distance between them <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> while the latter declined due to Buczynski's homosexuality. He then approached Gwen Thompson (1928–1986), matriarch of the New England Covens of Traditionalist Witches (NECTW), asking for initiation, although declined to inform her of his sexual orientation. Thompson took a liking to the young man, and welcomed him into her coven, where he proceeded to adopt the craft name of [...] "Hermes". They developed a strong friendship, much to Slater's dismay, and Buczynski soon rose to a second degree position, adopting an adapted craft name of [...] "Hermes Dionysos" [...] and becoming High Priest of Thompson's coven. Thompson ultimately became attracted to the young man, and repeatedly asked him {{to have sex with}} her, to which he refused. Their friendship broke down, and he was expelled from her North Haven coven.|$|E

500|$|On {{the night}} of July 24/25, 1261, Strategopoulos and his men {{approached}} the city walls and hid at a monastery near the Gate of the Spring. Strategopoulos sent a detachment of his men, who, led {{by some of the}} thelematarioi, {{made their way to the}} city through a secret passage. They attacked the walls from the inside, surprised the guards and opened the gate, allowing the Nicaean force entry into the city. [...] The Latins were taken completely unaware, and after a short struggle, the Nicaeans gained control of the land walls. As news of this spread across the city, the Latin inhabitants, from Emperor Baldwin II downwards, hurriedly rushed to the harbours of the Golden Horn, hoping to escape by ship. At the same time, Strategopoulos' men set fire to the Venetian buildings and warehouses along the coast to prevent them from landing there. Thanks to the timely arrival of the returning Venetian fleet, many of the Latins managed to evacuate to the Latin-held parts of Greece, but the city was lost for good. The recapture of Constantinople signalled the restoration of the Byzantine Empire, and on August 15, the day of the Dormition of the Theotokos, Emperor Michael entered the city in triumph and was crowned at the Hagia Sophia. The rights of John IV Laskaris were brushed aside, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> was blinded and imprisoned.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{begins with}} the fourteen-year-old Norman McGregor {{packaging}} {{a loaf of bread}} for his uncle, the [...] "village wit", – who ironically nicknames him [...] "Beaut" [...] because of his off-putting appearance – in his mother Nance's Coal Creek bakery (bought with the savings of her late husband/Beaut's father [...] "Cracked" [...] McGregor). [...] Not long after, frustrated by the local miners expecting bread on credit without first settling their debts, Beaut closes the bakery during a miner's strike. That evening, as the now-drunk miners move to ransack the bakery (and assault Beaut), he is saved by a troupe of soldiers marching in formation. After the episode, the bakery remains closed and Nance goes to work at the mining office while Beaut idles about. When Beaut is 18 years old, his mother becomes too ill to work <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> gets a job as a stableboy. One day, as a prank, his fellow stableboys get Beaut (a teetotaler up to that point) blind drunk with a [...] "horrible mess" [...] made just for that purpose. Having reached a breaking point, Beaut takes the rest of his father's savings and leaves Coal Creek for Chicago on the same evening. He arrives in the City just after the 1893 World's Fair. Despite a shortage of jobs, McGregor easily finds a warehouse job and settles into a routine of work during the day and night school/independent reading at night. One day, in a break from the ordinary, the usually unsocial McGregor gives in to the urging of his neighbor Frank Turner, a barber and amateur violin-maker, and goes to a dance. Despite his aloofness, McGregor meets Edith Carson, a frail, mousy, and somewhat homely milliner/shop owner, with whom he develops a platonic relationship.|$|E
500|$|Tatiana {{fell in love}} on {{at least}} one occasion. In an article in the December 2004 edition of the {{magazine}} Royalty Digest: A Journal of Record Peter de Malama wrote that his cousin, Dmitri Yakovlevich Malama, an officer in the Imperial Russian Cavalry, met Tatiana when he was wounded in 1914 and a romance later developed between Tatiana <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> when he was appointed an equerry to the court of the Tsar at Tsarskoye Selo. Dmitri Malama gave Tatiana a French bulldog she named [...] "Ortipo" [...] in September 1914. [...] "Forgive me about the little dog," [...] Tatiana wrote to her mother on 30 September 1914. [...] "To say the truth, when he asked should I like to have it if he gave it to me, I at once said yes. You remember, I always wanted to have one, and only afterwards when we came home I thought that suddenly you might not like me having one. But I really was so pleased at the idea that I forgot about everything." [...] The dog died, but Malama gave her a replacement puppy. Tatiana took it with her to Yekaterinburg, where it died {{with the rest of the}} family. Malama paid the imperial family a visit some eighteen months after he gave Tatiana the first dog. [...] "My little Malama came for an hour yesterday evening," [...] wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on 17 March 1916. [...] "...Looks flourishing more of a man now, an adorable boy still. I must say a perfect son in law he w(ou)ld have been – why are foreign P(rin)ces not as nice!" [...] Malama was killed in August 1919 while commanding a unit of the White Russians fighting the civil war against the Bolsheviks in the Ukraine, according to Peter de Malama.|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{commonly}} {{agree that}} Shakespeare uses legal imagery {{as a metaphor}} for the relationship between the speaker <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man.</b> Helen Vendler and Stephen Booth are of the same opinion that the legal terms of the sonnet frame the relationship between the speaker <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> as a contract now void because of the beloved's realization of his greater worth. The relationship between the speaker <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> is expressed in the language of legal and financial transaction: [...] "possessing", [...] "estimate", [...] "charter", [...] "bonds", [...] "determinate", [...] "riches", and [...] "patent" [...] —also [...] "dear" [...] and [...] "worth" [...] in the financial sense. Booth, in addition to the above, understands hold and granting in a legal and financial sense as well.|$|E

2500|$|Sonnet 144 (along with Sonnet 138) was {{published}} in the Passionate Pilgrim (1599). Shortly before this, Francis Meres referred to Shakespeare's Sonnets in his handbook of Elizabethan poetry, Palladis Tamia, or Wit's Treasurie, published in 1598, which was frequently talked about in the literary centers of London taverns. Shakespeare's sonnets are mostly addressed to a young man, but the chief subject of Sonnet 127 through Sonnet 152 is the [...] "dark lady". Several sonnets portray a conflicted relationship between the speaker, the [...] "dark lady" [...] <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man.</b> Sonnet 144 {{is one of the most}} prominent sonnets to address this conflict.|$|E
