5|$|Uematsu {{was born}} in Kōchi, Kōchi Prefecture, Japan. A self-taught musician, he began {{to play the piano}} when he was between the ages of eleven and twelve years old, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not take any formal piano lessons. He has an older sister who also played the piano. After graduating from Kanagawa University with a degree in English, Uematsu played the {{keyboard}} in several amateur bands and composed music for television commercials. When Uematsu was working at a music rental shop in Tokyo, a Square employee asked if he would be interested in creating music for some of the titles they were working on. Although he agreed, Uematsu at the time considered it a side job, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not think it would become a full-time career.

5|$|After the {{revolution}} broke out, the revolt's leaders chose Sun Yat Sen as provisional president of {{what became the}} Republic of China, overthrowing the Manchu Dynasty, Taft was reluctant to recognize the new government, although American public opinion {{was in favor of}} it. The U.S. House of Representatives in February 1912 passed a resolution supporting a Chinese republic, but Taft and Knox felt recognition should come as a concerted action by Western powers. Taft in his final annual message to Congress in December 1912 indicated that he was moving towards recognition once the republic was fully established, but by then he had been defeated for re-election <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not follow through.|$|E

5|$|Although Evans {{had always}} {{suffered}} from bouts of depression, and bitterness towards those he felt did not appreciate his inventions, such sentiments seemed to peak {{in his later}} years. During {{one of his many}} legal battles in 1809, comments from the presiding judge sent Evans into a particular fury in which he dramatically incinerated many schematics and papers regarding his inventions, both prior and future. Evans declared at the time that inventing had led only to heartache, disappointment and under-appreciation; and committed himself to business and material acquisition {{for the sake of his}} family. Ultimately what was burned represents only a small proportion of what survives from Evans, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> continue his interest in inventing, but the tone of Evans's later life was undoubtedly one of hostility and disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Although not an isolationist, Coolidge was {{reluctant}} to enter into foreign alliances. He considered the 1920 Republican victory as {{a rejection of the}} Wilsonian position that the United States should join the League of Nations. While not completely opposed to the idea, Coolidge believed the League, as then constituted, did not serve American interests, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not advocate membership. He spoke in favor of the United States joining the Permanent Court of International Justice (World Court), provided that the nation would not be bound by advisory decisions. In 1926, the Senate eventually approved joining the Court (with reservations). The League of Nations accepted the reservations, but it suggested some modifications of its own. The Senate failed to act; the United States never joined the World Court.|$|E
5|$|Amin did {{not write}} an autobiography, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not authorize an {{official}} written account of his life. So, there are discrepancies regarding when and where he was born. Most biographical sources claim that {{he was born in}} either Koboko or Kampala around 1925. Other unconfirmed sources state Amin's year of birth from as early as 1923 to as late as 1928. Amin's son Hussein has stated that his father was born in Kampala in 1928.|$|E

Leutnant Arnold Döring of IV./NJG 3 engaged and destroyed two bombers between 01:05 and 01:15 using his Schräge Musik. The British crews that witnessed the action switched off their navigation lights <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not engage another bomber successfully. Döring had been told not to return with any ammunition so he engaged any targets of opportunity. He shot up a locomotive and set a wagon on fire. During the ten-minute time-frame Döring had claimed his victories, nine bombers had been destroyed. At 01:05 60 of No. 5 Group's Lancasters were still airborne and further losses were incurred against NJG 5 machines.|$|E
5|$|Barkley's party loyalty in the governor's race {{made him}} a {{formidable}} candidate to challenge Stanley, who by 1924 had angered members of both party factions, but Barkley {{had spent most of}} his funds in his campaign against Cantrill, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want to risk his reputation as a party unifier by challenging a Democrat. Instead, he decided to rebuild his war chest to unseat Kentucky's incumbent Republican senator, Richard P. Ernst, in 1926. In the meantime, he refrained from using his influence in state races to avoid losing any goodwill with Kentucky voters.|$|E
