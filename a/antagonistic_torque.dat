40|$|PURPOSE: The biarticular rectus femoris (RF), {{operating}} on the ascending limb of the force-length curve, produces more force at longer lengths. However, experimental studies consistently report higher knee extension torque when supine (longer RF length) compared to seated (shorter RF length). Incomplete activation in the supine position has been proposed {{as the reason for}} this discrepancy, but differences in antagonistic co-activation could also be responsible due to altered hamstrings length. We examined the role of agonist and antagonist muscles in explaining the isometric knee extension torque variation with changes in hip joint angle. METHOD: Maximum voluntary isometric knee extension torque (joint MVC) was recorded in seated and supine positions from nine healthy males (30. 2  ±  7. 7  years). <b>Antagonistic</b> <b>torque</b> was estimated using EMG and added to the respective joint MVC (corrected MVC). Submaximal tetanic stimulation quadriceps torque was also recorded. RESULT: Joint MVC was not different between supine (245  ±  71. 8  Nm) and seated (241  ±  69. 8  Nm) positions and neither was corrected MVC (257  ±  77. 7 and 267  ±  87. 0  Nm, respectively). <b>Antagonistic</b> <b>torque</b> was higher when seated (26  ±  20. 4  Nm) than when supine (12  ±  7. 4  Nm). Tetanic torque was higher when supine (111  ±  31. 9  Nm) than when seated (99  ±  27. 5  Nm). CONCLUSION: Antagonistic co-activation differences between hip positions do not account for the reduced MVC in the supine position. Rather, reduced voluntary knee extensor muscle activation in that position is the major reason for the lower MVC torque when RF is lengthened (hip extended). These findings can assist standardising muscle function assessment and improving musculoskeletal modelling applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} age-related differences in contractile and elastic properties of both dorsi- (DF) and plantarflexor (PF) muscles controlling the ankle joint in young and older adults. Experimental data were collected while twelve young and twelve older male and female participants performed maximal effort isometric and isovelocity contractions on a dynamometer. Equations were fit to the data to give torque-angle (Th) and torque-angular velocity (Tv) relations. Muscle series-elasticity was measured during ramped dynamometer contractions using ultrasonography to measure aponeurosis extension as a function of torque; second order polynomials were used to characterize the torqueextension (TDL) relation. The results showed no age differences in DF maximal torque and none for female PF; however, older males had smaller maximal PF torques compared to young males. In both muscle groups and genders, older adults had decreased concentric force capabilities. Both DF and PF TDL relations were more nonlinear in the older adults. Older PF, but not DF muscles, were stiffer compared to young. A simple antagonism model suggested age-related differences in Th and Tv relations would be magnified if <b>antagonistic</b> <b>torque</b> contributions were included. This assessment of static, dynamic, and elastic joint properties affords a comprehensive view of age-related modifications in muscle function. Although many clinical studies use maximal isometric strength as a marker of functional ability, the results demonstrate that there are als...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the pitch sensitivity of cholesteric phases of helicoidal patchy cylinders as a generic model for chiral (bio-) polymers and helix-shaped colloidal rods. The behaviour of the macroscopic cholesteric pitch is studied from microscopic principles by invoking a simple density functional theory generalised to accommodate weakly twisted director fields. Upon changing {{the degree of}} alignment along the local helicoidal director we find that cholesteric phases exhibit a sudden sense inversion whereby the cholesteric phase changes from left- to right-handed and vice versa. Since the local alignment is governed by thermodynamic variables such as density, temperature or the amplitude of an external directional field such pitch sense inversions can be expected in systems of helical mesogens of both thermotropic and lyotropic origin. We show that the spontaneous change of helical symmetry is {{a direct consequence of}} an <b>antagonistic</b> effective <b>torque</b> between helical particles with a certain prescribed internal helicity. The results may help opening up new routes towards precise control of the helical handedness of chiral assemblies by a judicious choice of external control parameters.

40|$|O treinamento excêntrico (Texc) produz adaptações musculares que minimizam a ocorrência de lesões e é usado em reabilitação e treinamento de força, mas pouco se sabe sobre seus efeitos no equilíbrio entre músculos antagonistas do joelho. As razões de torque permitem determinar esses desequilíbrios musculares. O objetivo do estudo foi avaliar os efeitos de 12 semanas de Texc nas razões de torque excêntrico (Iexc:Qexc) entre os músculos isquiotibiais (I) e quadríceps (Q). Vinte e quatro sujeitos saudáveis do sexo masculino foram distribuídos nos grupos controle (GC, n= 13, idade 27, 7 ± 4, 6 anos) e {{experimental}} (GE, n= 11, idade 28, 5 ± 9, 5 anos), submetido ao treinamento. Um dinamômetro isocinético foi utilizado para o Texc (velocidade de - 60 º/s) e para as avaliações (uma a cada quatro semanas). As razões de torque medidas foram comparadas estatisticamente entre os grupos e intragrupos entre as avaliações, com nível de significância de 5 %. No GE, foi observada redução das razões de torque da avaliação (AV) inicial para as demais: AV 1 x AV 2, p= 0, 005; AV 1 x AV 3, p= 0, 001; e AV 1 x AV 4, p Eccentric training produces {{skeletal muscle}} adaptations that help preventing muscle injuries, being {{often used in}} rehabilitation and physical fitness programs, but little is known {{of the effects of}} this training in the balance between knee <b>antagonistic</b> muscles. <b>Torque</b> ratios allow determining such balance. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the effect of a 12 -week eccentric training program on the eccentric torque ratio between hamstring and quadriceps muscles (Hecc:Qecc). Twenty-four healthy male subjects were assigned to either a control group (CG, n= 13, aged 27. 7 ± 4. 6 years) or an experimental group (EG, n= 11, aged 28. 5 ± 9. 5 years). An isokinetic dinamometer was used (angular velocity - 60 º/s) for both the eccentric training and the assessments, performed every four weeks. Torque ratios measured were statistically compared between groups and intragroups between assessments, with (significance level set at p< 0. 05. In EG a reduction in torque ratios was found from the initial assessment (AS 1) to the other three ones: AS 1 x AS 2, p= 0. 005; AS 1 x AS 3, p= 0. 001; and AS 1 x AS 4, p< 0. 001. At the last evaluation, EG torque ratios were lower than those of CG's (p= 0. 041). Eccentric training hence changes balance between knee flexor and extensor muscles: a 12 -week training program leads to lower Hecc:Qecc ratio and to extensor torque increase, with no significant change in flexor torque, being thus suitable for rehabilitation aimed at strengthening knee extensor muscles...|$|R
