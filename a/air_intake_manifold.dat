50|$|It is {{critical}} that {{the parts of the}} PCV system be kept clean and open, otherwise air flow will be insufficient. A plugged or malfunctioning PCV valve by itself cannot damage an engine; however the blowby will flow up in a reverse fashion up through the crankcase air inlet and if there isn't a separate catch can or oil separator at that inlet, then the blowby will contaminate the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>manifold.</b> On boosted engines this can be a real problem. A poorly maintained engine's PCV system will eventually contaminate the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> with oil sludge and if both the pcv valve and the crankcase air inlet are blocked then the crankcase pressure will build to a level that will damage seals and eventually the motor.|$|E

The car is driven onto the DYNO and many gauges and sensors are hooked up to the car that are controlled on an online program to test force, torque, or power. Through the testing, the car's engine maps can be changed to get the most amount of horsepower and ultimately speed out of the vehicle.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of the air intake system in a diesel engine could limit the overall engine performance. The intake manifold {{is an important part}} of the air intake system where enough air should be guided to the cylinder. Compactness is a conflicting feature to performance as engine rooms in general, and thereby engines, should use little space. Thus, the development of an <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> requires knowledge about function and placement of most other parts in the engine so that a compatible and compact <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> can be created. MarineDiesel AB is a Swedish company from Ängelholm developing and manufacturing marine diesel engines. The Master thesis project work has been performed in a real project where an engine, previously used in a train, is converted into a marine engine with twice the power. The engine must be designed to fit with the new requirements of the customer. These requirements directly affect the air intake system which must, as all other engine system, match the desired performance. A well-defined development process with theoretical and practical research together with company guidelines and engineering assessments has generated the concepts in this product development master thesis project. Two different intake manifold concepts have been created. The concepts are different in aspect to both manifold design and air intake system configuration. The air intake system and the manifold are dependent and therefore a feasible system concept has also been developed to each of the concepts.

This study focuses on developing a simulation method to use for such large scale optimisation of <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>manifolds.</b> The main focus in this study was the difference in flow quantities such as swirl number and pressure drop between the different cylinders for a given manifold. Four different simulation approaches were tested: one steady-state, two transient and one transient with a moving mesh. These simulation methods were tested on five different geometries based on a six cylinder, 13 L spark ignited (Otto) combustion engine and a six cylinder, 13 L compression ignited (Diesel) combustion engine. The five geometries were compared using the different simulation methods, with the main goal of determining if the different simulation methods provide the same optimal geometry. The most complex simulation model, the transient simulation with moving mesh, was chosen as main reference case in absence of experimental results. Results of this mock design of experiments show that the different simulation approaches do not perform consistently enough to recommend using any of the tested methods in further optimisation studies. While the various methods showed significantly different results when comparing the differences in flow parameters between cylinders, using the steady-state or transient methods to predict the flow parameters in a single cylinder is a viable approach. Multiple possible causes for the inconsistent results are discussed, chief among which is the chosen grid generation approach and selected convergence criteria.

These fuels however have a higher viscosity than conventional petro-diesel and may {{be referred to as}} Higher Viscous Fuels (HVF).

The common way to realize functional microstructures on metallic surfaces is to use laser ablation, electro discharge machining or micro milling. The handicap of these processes is their limited productivity. The approach of this project to raise the efficiency is to use the investment casting process to replicate microstructured surfaces by moulding from a laser-microstructured grand master pattern. The main research objective deals with the investigation of the single process steps of the investment casting process with regard to the moulding accuracy.

40|$|Abstract Automotive engine {{manufacturers}} are focusing increasingly {{their attention on}} noise generated by air intake systems. In particular {{in recent years the}} increased usage of plastics for <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> (AIM) production, in place of metallic materials, made the NVH optimization more complicated. In this framework, it is very important not only the minimization of the noise generated via fluid propagation (orifice-noise from inlets) but also of the noise radiated via the coupled fluid-structure interaction. In this work acoustical performance of an AIM prototype has been experimentally and numerically investigated. From the experimental point of view, the acoustic analysis was performed by means of acoustic intensity measurements around the body. In order to minimize the noise contribution from all the other sources of an operating engine, the AIM was assembled on an engine head which was mounted on a dynamic flow test bench, where the intake valve-train was driven by an electrical motor. The intake orifice noise was differently treated, both leaving the orifice open and employing a dissipative muffler. Simulations through a coupled fluid-structure approach were performed. The normal modes of the structure were previously calculated on a fully-detailed FEM model and checked through accelerometric data; material properties could then be properly chosen. Measured data of the pressure pulsations at the inlet valves was used as excitation and applied to a coarsened acoustic Indirect-BEM model of the AIM coupled with a structural FEM one. Tuning of experimental and numerical acoustic data was useful for defining a practical analysis procedure for NVH design of plastic AIMs. 1...|$|E
40|$|HHO {{otherwise}} known as hydroxy or Browns Gas is the gas produced from splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen from electrolysis and allowing the gas {{to stay in a}} premixed state for use on-demand without the need for storage. In 1918 Charles Frazer, a North American inventor, patented the first water electrolysis machine act as a hydrogen booster for internal combustion engines. Yull Brown, a Bulgarian born Australian inventor patented and attempted to popularize Browns Gas as a cutting gas and fuel additive during the 1970 ’s and 80 ’s. During the 2000 ’s there was a huge influx in Browns Gas devices coming to the mark, with many sensational claims of bringing dramatic reductions in fuel consumption and exhaust emissions in internal combustion engines. This research project involved experimentally validating the effects of on-board HHO addition on fuel economy and emissions in a 28 kW diesel generator. The diesel generator was run at 30 % and 55 % of the engines rated power output with three rates of HHO injection, with and without water injection. Results include accurate measurement and analysis of diesel consumption and exhaust emissions of the diesel generator under 16 combinations of generator loading, HHO injection and water injection. The HHO and water are injected into the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> of the engine. Error margins and calibrations are detailed, and environmental conditions accounted for in the findings. HHO was shown to increase diesel consumption under all conditions tested, proportional to the rate of injection – up to a 5. 2 % increase at 55 % load with 6 L/min of HHO addition. Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions were reduced up to 11. 8 % with the addition of water and HHO from an externally powered electrolyser. Even if the efficiency of the HHO system could be raised to 100 %, the thermal losses in the engine stage would still outweigh the economy gains from on-board HHO addition. ...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen {{remains an}} {{attractive}} alternative fuel to petroleum {{and a number}} of investigators claim that adding hydrogen to the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> of a diesel engine will reduce criteria emissions and diesel fuel consumption. Such claims are appealing when trying to simultaneously reduce petroleum consumption, greenhouse gases and criteria pollutants. The goal of this research was to measure the change in criteria emissions (CO, NO x, and PM 2. 5) and greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO 2), using standard test methods {{for a wide range of}} hydrogen addition rates. A two-stroke Detroit Diesel Corporation 12 V- 71 TI marine diesel engine was mounted on an engine dynamometer and tested at three out of the four loads specified in the ISO 8178 - 4 E 3 emission test cycle and at idle. The engine operated on CARB ultra-low sulfur # 2 diesel with hydrogen added at flow rates of 0, 22 and 220 SLPM. As compared with the base case without hydrogen, measurements showed that hydrogen injection at 22 and 220 SLPM had negligible influence on the overall carbon dioxide specific emission, EFCO 2. However, in examining data at each load the data revealed that at idle EFCO 2 was reduced by 21 % at 22 SLPM (6. 9 % of the added fuel energy was from hydrogen) and 37. 3 % at 220 SLPM (103. 1 % of the added fuel energy was from hydrogen). At all other loads, the influence of added hydrogen was insignificant. Specific emissions for nitrogen ox ides, EFNO x, and fine particulate matters, EFPM 2. 5, showed a trade-off relationship at idle. At idle, EFNO x was reduced by 28 % and 41 % with increasing hydrogen flow rates, whilst EFPM 2. 5 increased by 41 % and 86 % respectively. For other engine loads, EFNO x and EFPM 2. 5 did not change significantly with varying hydrogen flow rates. One of the main reasons for the greater impact of hydrogen at idle is that the contribution of hydrogen to the total fuel energy is much higher at idle as compared to the other loads. The final examination in this paper was the system energy balance when hydrogen is produced by an on-board electrolysis unit. An analysis at 75 % engine load showed that hydrogen production increased the overall equivalent fuel consumption by 2. 6 % at 22 SLPM and 17. 7 % at 220 SLPM. © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The throttle body is usually located between the air filter box and the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold,</b> and it is usually attached to, or near, the mass airflow sensor.|$|R
5000|$|Recently, {{the term}} [...] "Atkinson cycle" [...] {{has been used}} to {{describe}} a modified Otto-cycle engine in which the intake valve is held open longer than normal to allow a reverse flow of <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> into the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold,</b> this simulated Atkinson cycle is most notably used in the widespread Toyota 1NZ-FXE engine. The effective compression ratio is reduced (for the time the air is escaping the cylinder freely rather than being compressed), but the expansion ratio is unchanged. This means the compression ratio is smaller than the expansion ratio. Heat gained from burning fuel increases the pressure, thereby forcing the piston to move, expanding the air volume beyond the volume when compression began. The goal of the modern Atkinson cycle is to make the pressure in the combustion chamber {{at the end of the}} power stroke equal to atmospheric pressure. When this occurs, all available energy has been obtained from the combustion process. For any given portion of air, the greater expansion ratio converts more energy from heat to useful mechanical energy—meaning the engine is more efficient.|$|R
