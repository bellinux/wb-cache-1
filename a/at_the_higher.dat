30|$|The {{small number}} of blades allows the turbine to operate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> {{rotational}} speed; in contrast, {{it is impossible for}} <b>the</b> turbine with <b>high</b> blade number to operate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> rotation. One of the factors responsible is the inability of the high-bladed turbine to generate <b>the</b> power <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> rotational speed. This is because <b>the</b> attack angle <b>at</b> corresponding rotational speed is very low, resulting in low lift coefficient. In contrary, for the turbine with less blade number, it is possible to obtain a relatively more moderate attack angle <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> rotational speed, to allow the turbine obtaining <b>the</b> <b>high</b> lift coefficient <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> rotation speed.|$|R

5|$|There is no unique {{generally}} accepted system <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> taxonomic levels {{and there are}} frequent name changes at every level, from species upwards. Efforts among researchers are now underway to establish and encourage usage of a unified and more consistent nomenclature. Fungal species can also have multiple scientific names depending on their life cycle and mode (sexual or asexual) of reproduction. Web sites such as Index Fungorum and ITIS list current names of fungal species (with cross-references to older synonyms).|$|E
5|$|Although the Whig Party was on {{its final}} decline nationally, it {{remained}} strong in Tennessee, and the outlook for Democrats there in 1855 was poor. Feeling that re-election as governor was necessary {{to give him a}} chance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> offices he sought, Johnson agreed to make the run. Meredith P. Gentry received the Whig nomination. A series {{of more than a dozen}} vitriolic debates ensued. The issues in the campaign were slavery, the prohibition of alcohol, and the nativist positions of the Know Nothing Party. Johnson favored the first, but opposed the others. Gentry was more equivocal on the alcohol question, and had gained the support of the Know Nothings, a group Johnson portrayed as a secret society. Johnson was unexpectedly victorious, albeit with a narrower margin than in 1853.|$|E
5|$|Burgmeier {{started out}} as a youth at Triesen before moving to Vaduz in 2000. Although based in his home country, like all Liechtenstein clubs Vaduz played league {{football}} in Switzerlandat the time in the third tierbut also competed in the Liechtenstein Football Cup. In Burgmeier's first season the team won promotion to the Challenge League and won the Liechtenstein Cup with a 9–0 defeat against Ruggell in the final. He scored his first goal <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> level on 31 July 2001, in a postponed game from {{the first round of the}} season, which finished in a 4–1 victory against Thun. However, Vaduz finished in 11thplace in the Fall Season, before results improved and they finished in second place in the Final Table, avoiding being relegated. The team also successfully defended their Liechtenstein Cup defeating USV Eschen/Mauren 6–1 in the final.|$|E

5|$|Northwest Argentina is {{predominantly}} dry, hot, and subtropical. Owing to its rugged topography, {{the region is}} climatically diverse, depending on the altitude, temperature, and distribution of precipitation. Consequently, vegetation differs within these different climate types. In general, the climate {{can be divided into}} two main types: a cold arid or semi-arid climate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> altitudes, and warmer subtropical climate in the eastern parts of the region. Under the Köppen climate classification, the region has 5 different climate types: semi–arid (BS), arid (BW), temperate climate without a dry season and with a dry season (Cf and CW respectively), and an alpine climate at the highest altitudes.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement {{for the establishment of}} an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order. The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> level of political structure.|$|E

The school also runs several more outreach programmes, {{and as a result of}} these initiatives was recently awarded the Independent School Award 2010 for Outstanding Community/Public Benefit Initiative.|$|E

5|$|With {{his goal}} tally nearly {{reaching}} 40 goals after spending two full seasons in Sporting's main team, Villa got his chance in Spain's top-flight when Sporting were in financial difficulty – newly promoted Real Zaragoza signed him for approximately €3million {{in the summer}} of 2003. The striker had no trouble adapting to playing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> level, netting 17 times in his first season at Zaragoza. His league debut came during Zaragoza's first La Liga game since his arrival, where the team were defeated 1–0 away by Galician side Deportivo de La Coruña while his first goal came two games later, an eighth-minute goal against Real Murcia which put Zaragoza 2–0 up in a match which ended 3–0. 4 December 2003 saw him net his first brace (two goals) in a 2–2 draw against Athletic Bilbao and on 25 April 2004, he scored his first hat-trick in a tight 4–4 draw against Sevilla which saw Villa score all four of Zaragoza's goals, putting his team ahead on two occasions.|$|E
5|$|Stanton wanted EVE to be <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> end of technology, {{and asked}} iPod {{designer}} Jonathan Ive to inspect her design. He was very impressed. Her eyes are modelled on Lite-Brite toys, but Pixar {{chose not to}} make them overly expressive {{as it would be}} too easy to have her eyes turn into hearts to express love or something similar. Her limited design meant the animators had to treat her like a drawing, relying on posing her body to express emotion. They also found her similar to a manatee or a narwhal because her floating body resembled an underwater creature. Auto was a conscious homage to HAL 9000 from , and the usage of Also sprach Zarathustra for the showdown between the captain and Auto furthers that. The manner in which he hangs from a wall gives him a threatening feel, like a spider. Originally, Auto was designed entirely differently, resembling EVE, but masculine and authoritative; the Steward robots were also more aggressive Patrol-bots. The majority of the robot cast were formed with the Build-a-bot program, where different heads, arms and treads were combined together in over a hundred variations. The humans were modelled on sea lions due to their blubbery bodies, as well as babies. The filmmakers noticed baby fat is a lot tighter than adult fat and copied that texture for the film's humans.|$|E
