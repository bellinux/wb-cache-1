40|$|Psychologists have {{identified}} several limitations to, and biases in, human decision-making processes. One such bias is the <b>anchoring</b> <b>and</b> adjustment effect, {{which has been}} demonstrated to be robust {{both inside and outside}} the experimental Z. laboratory. Some decision support systems DSS have been designed to lessen the effects of decision-making limitations with promising results. This study tested a DSS designed to mitigate the effects of the <b>anchoring</b> <b>and</b> adjustment bias. The results show that <b>anchoring</b> <b>and</b> adjustment remains robust within the context of automated decision support.

40|$|In today's enterprises, {{forecasts}} of time series are {{a crucial part}} of the planning process. Human experts often create these forecasts - for example, in cash flow or sales forecasting. The human participation can lead to forecasts being influenced by cognitive biases like <b>anchoring</b> <b>and</b> adjustment. This study aims to detect <b>anchoring</b> <b>and</b> adjustment effects in forecasting processes based on the newly developed Bandwidthmodel. We show that the Bandwidthmodel has higher explanatory power with regard to the relation between <b>anchoring</b> <b>and</b> adjustment effects and forecast errors in comparison to other models based on synthetic forecast series. These series allow the generation of specific pattern of <b>anchoring</b> <b>and</b> adjustment effects. The results suggest that usage of the Bandwidthmodel can improve the accuracy of forecasts and is beneficially for a forecast support system...|$|R

5|$|A sailor's {{work was}} {{hard in the}} days of sail. When off duty, many sailors played musical {{instruments}} or joined in unison to sing folksongs such as the mid-eighteenth century ballad The Mermaid, a song which expressed the sailors' superstition that seeing a mermaid foretold a shipwreck. When on duty, there were many repetitive tasks, such as turning the capstan to raise the <b>anchor</b> <b>and</b> heaving on ropes to raise and lower the sails. To synchronise the crew's efforts, sea shanties were sung, with a lead singer performing the verse and the sailors joining in the chorus. In the Royal Navy in Nelson's time, these work songs were banned, being replaced by the notes of a fife or fiddle, or the recitation of numbers.|$|E
5|$|After riding {{at anchor}} for two weeks, Endeavour was heaved {{out of the}} water on 9 November and laid on her side for repairs. Some damaged timbers were found to be infested with shipworms, which {{required}} careful removal to ensure they did not spread throughout the hull. Broken timbers were replaced and the hull recaulked, scraped of shellfish and marine flora, and repainted. Finally, the rigging and pumps were renewed and fresh stores brought aboard for the return journey to England. Repairs and replenishment were completed by Christmas Day 1770, and the next day Endeavour weighed <b>anchor</b> <b>and</b> set sail westward towards the Indian Ocean.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{definition}} of <b>anchors</b> <b>and</b> links for nested composite nodes, that is, composite nodes containing other composite nodes. It considers questions such as link inheritance and node reference, which become fairly complex {{in the presence of}} nested compositions. Then, the paper extends the discussion to include virtual <b>anchors</b> <b>and</b> links, defined by expressions in an appropriate language. Finally, it addresses some issues related to <b>anchors</b> <b>and</b> links in the presence of object versioning, such as how to maintain automatic reference to the last version of a node. The definition of <b>anchors</b> <b>and</b> links for composite nodes poses serious problems to the formal definition of a conceptual model for hypermedia systems. The complexity is further increased if the model: (1) allows nested composite nodes, that is, composite nodes containing other composite nodes; (2) permits the sam...|$|R

The other ship cut her <b>anchor</b> <b>and</b> attempted to flee, but the boats of Clarisse overhauled and captured her without resistance, most of her crew being ashore.

5|$|Like {{many species}} of spider, a P. schultzi lays a {{continuous}} dragline of silk as it moves, {{and from time to}} time anchors the dragline to a surface with a spot of sticky silk. This allows the spider to return to the surface if the animal is dislodged. A spider about to jump first lays a sticky silk <b>anchor,</b> <b>and</b> then lays out a dragline as it flies. Unlike those of most jumping spiders, P. schultzi′s draglines stick to each other and, when a P. schultzi has laid a few lines across a gap, it uses these as walkways and reinforces them with additional silk as it moves.|$|E
