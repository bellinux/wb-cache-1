40|$|Abstract: Mesothelioma is a {{malignancy}} {{with poor}} prognosis. It is chiefly caused by asbestos expo-sure and its symptoms can occur about 30 – 50 yr {{after the initial}} exposure. This study aims to pre-dict the future trends in mesothelioma mortality in Japan using a method that is {{an alternative to the}} age-cohort model. Our approach is based on a risk function that links mesothelioma mortality combined with data pertaining to the population, size of the labor force, and quantity of asbestos imports. We projected the number of deaths occurring in individuals aged 50 – 89 for yr 2003 – 2050 using risk functions. Our results have indicated that mesothelioma mortality among Japanese peo-ple aged 50 – 89 yr will continue to increase until 2027 and reach a maximum of 66, 327 deaths in the years 2003 – 2050. Our estimate has also suggested that the number of mesothelioma deaths could be significantly reduced if there were adequate compliance with the <b>administrative</b> level <b>guidelines</b> for occupational asbestos exposure...|$|R

40|$|A {{health care}} {{organization}} simultaneously belongs to two different institutional value patterns: a professional and an administrative value pattern. At the administrative level medical problem-solving processes are generally {{perceived as the}} efficient application of familiar chains of activities to well-defined problems; and a low task uncertainty is therefore assumed at the work-floor level. This assumption is further reinforced through clinical pathways and other <b>administrative</b> <b>guidelines.</b> However, {{studies have shown that}} in clinical practice such <b>administrative</b> <b>guidelines</b> are often considered inadequate and difficult to implement mainly because physicians generally perceive task uncertainty to be high and that the guidelines do not cover the scope of encountered deviations. The current administrative level guidelines impose uniform structural features that meet the requirement for low task uncertainty. Within these structural constraints physicians must organize medical problem-solving process to meet any task uncertainty that may be encountered. Medical problem-solving processes with low task uncertainty need to be organized independently of processes with high task uncertainty. Each process must be evaluated according to different performance standards and needs to have autonomous administrative guideline models. Although clinical pathways seem appropriate when there is low task uncertainty, other kinds of guidelines are required when the task uncertainty is high...|$|E

40|$|This study explores {{and seeks}} to explain the EIA {{procedures}} practice gap in Lao PDR. It reviews the literature and studies EIA legislation, <b>administrative</b> procedures, <b>guidelines,</b> and relevant documents by using a model proposed by Leu et al. (1996) and applying criteria proposed by Wood (1995) to evaluate the performance of EIA systems. Key EIA legislation in Lao PDR has many strengths, but also major weaknesses: Inadequate planning procedures, no secondary regulations, few trained and skilled personnel, inadequate public consultation, lack of environmental data, weak follow-up and monitoring, and no enforcement machinery. Additionally, the EIA approval procedure is very bureaucratic and easily derailed by political and economic pressures. In addition, coordination among EIA proponents, consultants, concerned ministries, local authorities, planners, and decision-makers is generally weak. This delays decision-making and hinders implementation of environmental regulations. Thus, procedures and evaluation are not always performed well. EIAs are more a project justification tool than a project planning tool for sustainable development. We conclude with recommendations to strengthen the system, such as improving capacity building, implementing an EIA consultants’ accreditation system, ensuring effective public participation and access to EIA reports, applying systematic EIAs, reviewing criteria, and promoting environmental awareness. </p...|$|R
