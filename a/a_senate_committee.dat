5|$|During the 2007 {{legislative}} session, Rice sponsored 16 {{pieces of}} legislation, including 11 {{as the primary}} sponsor in the House of Representatives. Among {{the most prominent of}} his bills was a measure to set up a cold case unit within the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to investigate Colorado's 1200 unsolved homicides. After passage, Gov. Ritter signed the bill into law. Rice also pursued legislation to cut taxes for businesses by raising the personal property tax exemption. After having passed the state house unanimously, the measure died in <b>a</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>committee.</b>|$|E
5|$|More than $400 billion {{were stolen}} from the {{treasury}} by Nigeria's leaders between 1960 and 1999. In late 2013, Nigeria's then central bank governor Lamido Sanusi informed President Goodluck Jonathan that the state oil company, NNPC, had failed to remit US$20 billion in oil revenues, which it owed the state. Jonathan, however, dismissed the claim and replaced Sanusi for alleged mismanagement of the central bank's budget. <b>A</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>committee</b> also found Sanusi's account to be lacking substance. After {{the conclusion of the}} NNPC's account audit, it was announced in January 2015 that NNPC's non-remitted revenue is actually US$1.48 billion, which it needs to refund back to the Government.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} bill first passed the Commons, Baird {{acknowledged}} that the Conservatives might have unintentionally broken political financing laws by failing to report convention fees collected in 2005. He told <b>a</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>committee</b> that $1.7 million was left unreported {{and that he did}} not realize it was an issue at the time. The matter is under review by the Chief Electoral Officer. The Conservatives quietly tabled an amendment to the Accountability Act in November 2006, stipulating that convention fees will not be counted as political contributions.|$|E

5|$|The {{significance}} of the APEC summit called for stringent and expensive security arrangements. The Protective Security Coordination Centre, of the National Security and Criminal Justice Group from the Australian Attorney-General's Department, oversaw security planning through the APEC 2007 Security Branch, formed expressly for the APEC meetings. In order to secure and monitor the summit, the New South Wales Police Force instituted the APEC Police Security Command. Many public roads in Sydney were closed, as leaders, officials, and personnel travelled in motorcades around the city centre. Figures released by the state government at <b>a</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>committee</b> hearing show that security measures at APEC cost $170million.|$|E
5|$|Laffoon's {{administration}} {{was confronted by}} the economic difficulties of the Great Depression. While he proposed a number of improvements, money was not available in the state budget to implement his plans. In his first full year in office, he cut $11.5 million from the state budget, but it remained out-of-balance. The state issued additional interest-bearing warrants to cover its debts. In 1931, these warrants accounted for 24.2 percent of the state's receipts; by 1932, that number had climbed to 40.2 percent. In order to raise more funds, Laffoon proposed a 2 percent state sales tax in 1932. The proposal was extremely unpopular with merchants and private citizens, and it showed little promise of passing in the General Assembly. On March 2, 1932, a mob of 100 anti-tax protesters stormed the governor's mansion, damaging some items inside. In {{an attempt to get}} the tax passed, Laffoon agreed to seek only a 1 percent tax. The proposal passed the House, but <b>a</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>committee</b> refused to report it to the full chamber for a vote.|$|E
5|$|Mathews {{began her}} career in 1990 as an {{associate}} at the New York consulting firm McKinsey & Company. In 1992 Mathews joined Bill Clinton's presidential campaign and led the economic team for the president-elect. Following Clinton's inauguration, Mathews, with Robert Rubin, helped set up the National Economic Council (NEC). She served as Staff Director of the NEC from 1993 to 1995. While Mathews was at NEC, the White House pushed for healthcare reform. Mathews was among those in the administration who advocated for finding ways, apart from legislation, to curb healthcare costs. When Rubin became Secretary of the Treasury in 1995, Mathews became his Chief of Staff. She testified before <b>a</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Committee</b> during the Whitewater investigations regarding her search of Vince Foster's garbage {{and the fate of}} the documents she discovered. Mathews told the committee she had been looking for an indication as to why Foster had committed suicide and denied ordering any documents destroyed.|$|E

25|$|There were initial speculations that {{sabotage}} {{had caused}} the plane crash. Magsaysay had first come into prominence when as Secretary of Defense during the Quirino administration, he had led {{the fight against the}} communist-inspired insurgency of the Hukbalahap movement. However, no evidence emerged to support the theory of sabotage. On April 27, 1957, the chief of the Philippine Constabulary, General Manuel F. Cabal, testified before <b>a</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>committee</b> that the crash had been caused by metal fatigue, which had broken a drive shaft that caused a power failure on board the plane shortly after takeoff.
