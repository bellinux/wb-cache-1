40|$|Emerging {{applications}} like {{electronic commerce}} and secure communications over open networks have made clear the fundamental role of {{public key cryptography}} as a unique enabler for world-wide scale security solutions. On the other hand, these solutions clearly expose {{the fact that the}} protection of private keys is a security bottleneck in these sensitive applications. This problem is further worsened in the cases where a single and unchanged private key must be kept secret for very long time (such is the case of certi cation <b>authority</b> <b>keys,</b> bank and e-cash keys, etc.). One crucial defense against exposure of private keys is o ered by threshold cryptography where the private key functions (like signatures or decryption) are distributed among several parties such that a predetermined number of parties must cooperate in order to correctly perform these operations. This protects keys from any single point of failure. An attacker needs to break into a multiplicity of locations before it can compromise the system. However, in the case of long-lived keys the attacker still has a considerable period of time (like a few years) to gradually break the system. Here we present proactive public key systems where the threshold solutions are further enhanced by periodic refreshment of the shared function in such away that the private key (and its corresponding public key) is kept unchanged for as long as required, yet the breaking of the system requires the attacker to break int...|$|E

Catholic and Orthodox Christians do not believe that such a complete apostasy ever took place when defending the validity of their priesthoods, and these churches do not recognize the priesthood exercised by Latter Day Saints.|$|R

This article provides {{a case study}} for in-service monitoring of a recently built long-span hybrid cable-stayed bridge, Queshi Bridge, in southern China. Three parameters, namely the cable forces, main structure deformations, and their vibrations are monitored with different methods at regular intervals over a time period of about four years. The results to date are very encouraging as the SHM systems installed in the bridge {{have been able to}} provide vital information about the state of health of the bridge to the transportation <b>authorities.</b> <b>Key</b> Words: cable-stayed bridges, health monitoring, cable force, deformation monitoring, vibrational characteristics...|$|R

MOCA is a distributed certificate authority (CA) based on threshold cryptography. We present a set of guidelines for a secure configuration of threshold cryptography to maintain strong security. MOCA utilizes a carefully selected set of mobile nodes to function as a collective certificate authority while the MOCA nodes are kept anonymous. Equipped with a novel routing protocol designed to support the unique communication pattern for certification traffic, MOCA achieves high availability without sacrificing security. Both the security of the framework and the operational performance is evaluated with rigorous analysis and extensive simulation study. ...|$|R
