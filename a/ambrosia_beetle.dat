5|$|Mutualism is {{well known}} in a few beetles, such as the <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle,</b> which {{partners}} with fungi to digest the wood of dead trees. The beetles excavate tunnels in dead trees in which they cultivate fungal gardens, their sole source of nutrition. After landing on a suitable tree, an <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle</b> excavates a tunnel in which it releases spores of its fungal symbiont. The fungus penetrates the plant's xylem tissue, digests it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near the surface of the beetle gallery, so the weevils and the fungus both benefit. The beetles cannot eat the wood due to toxins, and uses its relationship with fungi to help overcome the defenses of its host tree in order to provide nutrition for their larvae. Chemically mediated by a bacterially produced polyunsaturated peroxide, this mutualistic relationship between the beetle and the fungus is coevolved.|$|E

25|$|A {{few dozen}} species of ambrosia fungi have been described, {{currently}} in the polyphyletic genera Ambrosiella (mostly Microascales), Raffaelea, Ceratocystiopsis and Dryadomyces (from Ophiostomatales), Ambrosiozyma (yeasts), and Entomocorticium (Basidiomycota). Many more species remain to be discovered. Little {{is known about the}} bionomy or specificity of ambrosia fungi. Ambrosia fungi are thought to be dependent on transport and inoculation provided by their beetle symbionts, as they have not been found in any other habitat. All ambrosia fungi are probably asexual and clonal. Some beetles are known to acquire ("steal") fungal inoculum from fungal gardens of other <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle</b> species.|$|E
25|$|After {{landing on}} a {{suitable}} tree, an <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle</b> excavates a tunnel {{in which it}} releases spores of its fungal symbiont. The fungus penetrates the plant's xylem tissue, digests it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near {{the surface of the}} beetle gallery. The majority of ambrosia beetles colonize xylem (sapwood and/or heartwood) of dying or recently dead trees, but some attack live trees. Species differ in their preference for different parts of trees, different stages of deterioration, and in the shape of their tunnels ("galleries"). However, the majority of ambrosia beetles are not specialized to any taxonomic group of hosts, unlike most phytophagous organisms including the closely related bark beetles.|$|E
25|$|Logs {{and dying}} trees of several {{hardwood}} species including pignut hickory are {{attacked by the}} <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle</b> (Platypus quadridentatus) throughout the South and north to West Virginia and North Carolina.

Hickory, persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), and pecan (C. illinoinensis) are most frequently infested, but other hardwoods also are attacked. Healthy trees growing in proximity to heavily infested trees are occasionally attacked but almost always without success. Hickory and persimmon wood (useful {{in the manufacture of}} small products such as shuttle blocks, mallets, and mauls is sometimes seriously damaged.|$|E

40|$|Size is a {{defining}} feature {{of an animal}} and is a result of counteracting forces of selection, and studying size and SSD can reveal what drives selection of body size in a given direction. Scolytinae and Platypodinae are diverse groups, representing many different mating systems and feeding strategies, and are for this reason interesting research subjects. The influence of mating systems, initiating sex, feeding type and initiating sex on evolution of size in species of bark and <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> was investigated for nine species of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> and twelve species of bark beetles. Male biased SSD was found in all highly polygynous species of both bark and <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles.</b> In mildly polygynous and monogynous species, patterns were more diffuse, but in monogynous bark beetles there appeared to be a trend of female biased SSD. In several male initiated systems, where width of females is restricted, females were shown to evolve longer bodies than males. <b>Ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> had much less variation in the traits measured than did bark beetles, possibly caused by either tunneling practices or the more uniform resource quality of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles.</b> Female initiated species of bark beetles were significantly wider than male initiated species, suggesting that male initiation limits evolution of body size...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 The nursery {{industry}} plays {{a critical}} role in Oregon's economy. An increase in wood-boring insect, or borer, activity has impacted the industry. The goal of this research is to determine key borer species in the nursery industry, flight times so targeted spray schedules can be established, and assess grower knowledge of borer issues and their management. <b>Ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> were found to be important with focus on three key species: Monarthrum scutellare (LeConte), Xyleborus dispar (F.), and Xyleborinus saxesenii (Ratzeburg). Flight times were monitored from 7 May 2003 to 3 September 2003 and 18 February 2004 to 1 September 2004, using Lindgren funnel traps. The greatest number of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> for all species peaked in April, with a later peak in June for X saxesenii. The greatest number of specimens collected was X saxesenii.

2500|$|Ambrosia beetles are an [...] {{ecological}} guild, {{but not a}} [...] phylogenetic clade. The ambrosia habit is {{an example}} of convergent evolution, as several groups evolved the same symbiotic relationship independently. The highest diversity of ambrosia beetles is in the tropics. In the Paleotropical region, hundreds of species of Xyleborini and Platypodinae are the main agent initiating dead wood decomposition. In the Neotropics, Platypodinae and Xyleborini are joined by the scolytine tribe Cortylini. Compared to the diversity in the tropics, <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle</b> fauna in the temperate zone is rather limited. In the Nearctic region it is dominated by a few species from Cortylini, Xyleborini and Xyloterini.

2500|$|The word {{agriculture}} is a late Middle English adaptation of Latin agricultūra, from ager, [...] "field", and cultūra, [...] "cultivation" [...] or [...] "growing". Agriculture usually refers to human activities, {{although it is}} also observed in certain species of ant, termite and <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle.</b> To practice agriculture means to use natural resources to [...] "produce commodities which maintain life, including food, fiber, forest products, horticultural crops, and their related services." [...] This definition includes arable farming or agronomy, and horticulture, all terms for the growing of plants, animal husbandry and forestry. A distinction is sometimes made between forestry and agriculture, based on the former's longer management rotations, extensive versus intensive management practices and development mainly by nature, rather than by man. Even then, it is acknowledged {{that there is a}} large amount of knowledge transfer and overlap between silviculture (the management of forests) and agriculture.

40|$|Non-native {{bark and}} <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> {{represent}} {{a threat to}} forests worldwide. Their invasion patterns are, however, still unclear. Here we investigated first, if the spread of non-native bark and <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> is a gradual or a discontinuous process; second, which are the main correlates of their community structure; third, whether those correlates correspond to those of native species. We used data on species distribution of non-native and native scolytines in the continental 48 USA states. These data were analyzed through a beta-diversity index, partitioned into species richness differences and species replacement, using Mantel correlograms and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination for identifying spatial patterns, and regression on distance matrices to test the association of climate (temperature, rainfall), forest (cover area, composition), geographical (distance), and human-related (import) variables with β-diversity components. For both non-native bark and <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles,</b> β-diversity was mainly composed of species richness difference than species replacement. For non-native bark beetles, a discontinuous invasion process composed of long distance jumps or multiple introduction events was apparent. Species richness differences were primarily correlated with differences in import values while temperature was the main correlate of species replacement. For non-native <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles,</b> a more continuous invasion process was apparent, with the pool of non-native species arriving in the coastal areas that tended to be filtered as they spread to interior portions of the continental USA. Species richness differences were mainly correlated with differences in rainfall among states, while rainfall and temperature were the main correlates of species replacement. Our study suggests that the different ecology of bark and <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> influences their invasion process in new environments. The lower dependency that bark beetles have on climate allowed them to potentially colonize more areas within the USA, while non-native <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles,</b> being dependent on rainfall, are typically filtered by the environment...|$|R

30|$|<b>Ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), having {{approximately}} 3400 {{species in}} the sub-families Scolytinae and Platypodinae, are among the major pests which threat many fruit and forest trees (Hulcr and Dunn 2011). These beetles make galleries through sapwood (xylem) of host trees and cultivate symbiotic fungi such as Ambrosiella spp. and Raffaelea spp. in the galleries for their food (Harrington 2005). The symbiotic fungi which have co-evolved with <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> provide nutrition required {{for the development of}} larvae and adults (Norris 1979). The fungi are carried by females in a specialized structure known as mycangium or mycangia (Six 2003). Moreover, <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> often inoculate secondary pathogenic fungi such as Fusarium spp. (Kessler 1974) or bacteria (Hall et al. 1982) during entry into trees (Oliver and Mannion 2001). Consequently, these beetles could harm the trees by carrying plant diseases, tunneling the trees, and farming symbiotic fungi. Among bark and <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles,</b> Anisandrus dispar Fabricius and Xylosandrus germanus Blandford (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) are the most prevalent pest species all over the world (Oliver and Mannion 2001; Rabaglia et al. 2006; Ranger et al. 2016; Ak 2016). These pests are polyphagous and damage many perennial plants, including hazelnut (Bucini et al. 2005 and Ak et al. 2011).|$|R

30|$|EPF are {{important}} control agents of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles,</b> {{as they may}} affect larvae in the galleries as well as adults outside the host trees (Castrillo et al. 2013). Some EPF have been found associated with <b>ambrosia</b> and bark <b>beetles</b> (Popa et al. 2011). Several {{studies have indicated that}} B. bassiana, M. anisopliae, and I. fumosorosea were effective against <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> such as Trypodendron lineatum Olivier, X. germanus, Xylosandrus crassiusculus (Motschulsky), and Xyloborus glabratus Eichhoff (Castrillo et al. 2011, 2013 and 2015).

40|$|In Chapter 1, I {{review the}} {{literature}} regarding the semiochemistry of bark and <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> affecting native hardwood trees. I describe the host colonization behavior of bark and <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> {{and discuss the}} role semiochemicals play in locating suitable hosts. Additionally, I briefly describe the natural enemies of scolytid beetles affecting hardwoods. In Chapter 2, I evaluate the response of two exotic invasive <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles,</b> Xylosandrus crassiusculus and X. germanus, to conophthorin, a common bark volatile of deciduous trees in mixed-hardwood forests in north central Indiana and {{determine the extent to}} which conophthorin enhances the attraction of these <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> to ethanol-baited traps. I test the efficacy of verbenone alone as a repellent of these <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles.</b> Exotic invasive <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> are among the most economically important pests of trees in nursery stock and managed and natural forest systems in the United States. I found that conophthorin enhances the response of X. crassiusculus and two checkered beetle predators, Madoniella dislocatus and Pyticeroides laticornis, to ethanol-baited traps. There were fewer X. germanus and X. crassiusculus beetles within the verbenone-baited traps, suggesting it acts as a repellent for these beetles. The use of a non-host semiochemical repellent, such as verbenone, in combination with an attractant, conophthorin and ethanol, could be used to deter unwanted infestations of already established <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> from marketable trees in a push-pull strategy. In Chapter 3, I test the hypothesis that the host colonization behavior of Phloeotribus liminaris, an important pest of black cherry, is chemically mediated. Black cherry (Prunus serotina) is among the most marketable hardwood species in North America. Unfortunately, widespread infestations of the peach bark beetle, Phloeotribus liminaris (Harris), keep many of these trees from reaching veneer quality and significantly reduce the value. These beetles spend the majority of their life cycle concealed beneath the bark of trees, making them difficult to control with sprayed pesticides. To determine if the beetles are attracted to volatiles emanating from the larval host, we measured their walking response to bolts of black cherry in a glass olfactometer. We tested the attraction of adults to bolts infested with either males or females to determine whether a volatile pheromone mediates colonization behavior. In the field, we measured the response of beetles to baited Lindgren funnel traps. In these assays, males and females were significantly attracted to female-infested bolts, suggesting the presence of a female-produced aggregation pheromone. Information on the chemically-mediated colonization behavior of the peach bark beetle will aid in establishing effective management programs. ...|$|R
