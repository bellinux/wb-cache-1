Its reconstructions have gone through three stages: the elephantine quadrupedal horn-snouted reptile satisfied the Victorians, then a bipedal but still fundamentally reptilian animal using its tail to prop itself up dominated the early 20th century, but was slowly overturned during the 1960s by its current, more agile <b>and</b> <b>dynamic</b> representation, able to shift from two legs to all fours.|$|E

Issues related to tracking <b>and</b> optimizing <b>dynamic</b> systems are briefly reviewed. Three kinds of dynamic systems are defined {{for the purposes}} of this paper.

Sucessful tracking of a IO-dimensional parabolic function with a severity of up to 1. 0 is demonstrated. A number of issues related to tracking <b>and</b> optimizing <b>dynamic</b> systems with particle swarms are identified. Directions for future research and applications are suggested. ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} {{diagnostic}} {{accuracy of the}} clinical examination of the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) <b>and</b> of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>and</b> static pain tests for the recognition of temporomandibular disorder (TMD) pain. Methods: A blind examination, including all clinical tests needed for a RDC diagnosis of TMD pain, <b>and</b> the <b>dynamic</b> <b>and</b> static pain tests, was performed in 125 chronic TMD pain patients, 88 chronic dental pain patients, and 121 pain-free subjects. Allocation was based upon {{the results of an}} oral history and a dental examination. As indicators for diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the RDC examination <b>and</b> of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>and</b> static pain tests were compared to recommended levels of. 70 and. 90, respectively. Results: For the RDC examination, high sensitivity (. 88), but lower specificity (. 45 -. 71) was found. The specificity did not reach its recommended level. For the <b>dynamic</b> <b>and</b> static pain tests, specificity (. 84 -. 91) and sensitivity (. 65) did not differ from the recommended levels. Comparing the outcomes of the two examinations showed that the positive likelihood ratios of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>and</b> static pain tests were higher (p<. 001), while the negative likelihood ratios of the RDC examination were lower (p<. 01). Conclusion: For the confirmation of a suspected TMD origin of orofacial pain, it is better to rely on the <b>dynamic</b> <b>and</b> static pain tests. To rule out a TMD origin, more value should be attached to the RDC examination (no funding sources) ...|$|R
