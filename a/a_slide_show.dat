5|$|After {{his defeat}} in the 2000 presidential {{election}} by George W. Bush, Gore returned his focus to the topic. He edited and adapted <b>a</b> <b>slide</b> <b>show</b> he had compiled years earlier, and began featuring the slide show in presentations on global warming across the U.S. and around the world. At {{the time of the}} film, Gore estimated he had shown the presentation more than one thousand times.|$|E

25|$|After <b>a</b> <b>slide</b> <b>show</b> on February 19, 1936, of {{his trip}} to Bohuslän, a region in southwestern Sweden, Wirth {{convinced}} Himmler to launch an expedition to the region, the first official expedition financed by the Ahnenerbe. Bohuslän was known for its massive quantity of petroglyph rock carvings, which Wirth believed were evidence of an ancient writing system predating all known systems. Himmler appointed Wolfram Sievers to be the {{managing director of the}} expedition, likely because of Wirth’s earlier troubles balancing finances.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} {{descriptive}} passages, like {{the description of}} the palaces of Neptune and the Samorim of Calicute, the locus amoenus of the Island of Love (Canto IX), the dinner in the palace of Thetis (Canto X), and Gama's cloth (end of Canto II). Sometimes these descriptions are like <b>a</b> <b>slide</b> <b>show,</b> in which someone shows each of the things described there; examples include the geographic start of Gama's speech to the king of Melinde, certain sculptures of the palaces of Neptune and the Samorim, the speech of Paulo da Gama to the Catual, and the Machine of the World (Máquina do Mundo).|$|E
25|$|The group's {{earliest}} educational {{efforts were}} {{a series of}} slide shows of hardcore and softcore pornography, which were shown with critical commentary by a WAP presenter. The format of <b>a</b> <b>slide</b> <b>show</b> with critical commentary had been used earlier by Julia London of the Los Angeles group Women Against Violence Against Women to illustrate soft-core pornographic themes in rock album covers; WAP adapted the format to discuss pornography in general, including hardcore pornography. Slide shows were generally organized by local feminist groups, and held in women's homes as part of consciousness-raising meetings. The anti-pornography movement has continued to use slide shows as an educational tactic for feminist group meetings and public events.|$|E

500|$|CTW's {{researchers}} were {{strongly influenced by}} behaviorism, a popular movement in psychology during the late 1960s; therefore, many methods and tools used were primarily behavioral. Palmer developed [...] "the distractor", which he used to test if the material shown on Sesame Street captured young viewers' attention. Two children at a time were brought into the laboratory and shown an episode on a television monitor and <b>a</b> <b>slide</b> <b>show</b> next to it. The slides would change every seven seconds; researchers recorded when the children's attention was diverted from the episode. They were able to assess almost every second of Sesame Street this way; if an episode captured children's interest 80–90 {{percent of the time}}, producers would air it. However, if it only worked 50 percent of the time they would change (or remove) content.|$|E
500|$|Palmer and his team's {{approach}} to researching the show's effectiveness was innovative; {{it was the}} first time formative research was conducted in this way. [...] For example, Palmer developed [...] "the distractor", which he used to test if the material shown on Sesame Street captured young viewers' attention. [...] Two children at a time were brought into the laboratory; they were shown an episode on a television monitor and <b>a</b> <b>slide</b> <b>show</b> next to it. [...] The slides would change every seven seconds, and researchers recorded when the children's attention was diverted away from the episode. [...] They were able to record almost every second of Sesame Street this way; if the episode captured the children's interest 80–90% of the time, the producers would air it, but if it only tested 50%, they would reshoot. [...] By the fourth season of the show, the episodes rarely tested below 85%.|$|E
500|$|The Crowns were open-minded {{about the}} choice of artist; wanting a modern work, they {{solicited}} proposals {{from a list of}} prospective artists and architects. Jaume Plensa researched the traditions and history of fountains and studied anthropomorphism in fountain imagery. [...] Some of his early ideas for the project referenced Buckingham Fountain, but these were soon abandoned. His presentation to the Crown family started with <b>a</b> <b>slide</b> <b>show</b> of fountains from the Middle Ages through the 20thcentury. [...] Plensa focused on the philosophical meanings associated with fountains, their history, use and art. [...] His presentation included computer animation of facial expressions. The other finalists were Maya Lin, who presented a low-height horizontal form, and Robert Venturi, who presented a fountain that would have been [...] tall. In January 2000, Plensa won the commission to design the fountain over Lin and Venturi. [...] The installation is a video sculpture, commissioned to operate thirty years.|$|E

2500|$|The avant-garde {{collective}} Jikken Kōbō (Experimental Workshop), {{founded in}} 1950, was offered access to emerging audio technology by Sony. The company hired Toru Takemitsu {{to demonstrate their}} tape recorders with compositions and performances of electronic tape music. The first electronic tape pieces by the group were [...] "Toraware no Onna" [...] ("Imprisoned Woman") and [...] "Piece B", composed in 1951 by Kuniharu Akiyama. Many of the electroacoustic tape pieces they produced were used as incidental music for radio, film, and theatre. They also held concerts employing <b>a</b> <b>slide</b> <b>show</b> synchronized with a recorded soundtrack. Composers outside of the Jikken Kōbō, such as Yasushi Akutagawa, Saburo Tominaga and Shirō Fukai, were also experimenting with radiophonic tape music between 1952 and 1953.|$|E

2500|$|In 1967, the {{chairman}} of the Civil Service Commission expressed interest in using Union Station as a visitor center during the upcoming Bicentennial celebrations. Funding for this was collected over the next six years, and the reconstruction of the station included outfitting the Main Hall with a recessed pit to display <b>a</b> <b>slide</b> <b>show</b> presentation. This was officially the PAVE (Primary Audio-Visual Experience), but was sarcastically referred to as [...] "the Pit". The entire project was completed, save for the parking garage, and opening ceremonies were held on Independence Day 1976. [...] Due to a lack of publicity and convenient parking, the National Visitor Center was never popular. Financial considerations caused the National Park Service to close the theaters, end the slideshow presentation in [...] "the Pit", and lay off almost three-quarters of the center's staff on October 28, 1978.|$|E
2500|$|Movies {{are treated}} {{separately}} {{by the law}} {{as part of the}} category [...] "audiovisual works". Russian law does not require [...] "moving images": according to Elst, <b>a</b> <b>slide</b> <b>show</b> may be a [...] "audiovisual work" [...] if its internal consistency amongst the images is high enough. The law does, however, require that the images be recorded somehow: a live television broadcast is not an audiovisual work (but is covered by the broadcaster's neighbouring rights). For movies, the law exhaustively enumerates all the initial copyright holders: the director, the author of the script, and the composer of the film music, if any. The law stipulates a transfer of the economic rights relating to publishing the film (including the rights to subtitling and redubbing) to the producer, unless the contract specifies otherwise. Although not considered authors, other individuals such as the camera director or the set designer do have a copyright on their individual works. They may exploit their works independently of the film: a set designer may authorize the use of the set design for a theatre production, and a composer retains his right to remuneration if the music is performed. If the authors or other co-creators of a movie are employed by the producer, their works are subject to the rules for employee-created works. In this case, all economic rights are transferred by default to the producer.|$|E
