5|$|Based on {{external}} appearance, Plectania nannfeldtii {{is similar to}} Pseudoplectania vogesiaca. Although this latter species {{may be difficult to}} distinguish by its less hairy external fruit body surface, its microscopic characters identify it more definitively: P.vogesiaca has spores that are much smaller, typically with widths of 12–14µm. Helvella corium is another black cup fungus that appears in the spring; it has smaller spores, whitish margins on the cup edges, <b>and</b> <b>shorter</b> stems than P.nannfeldtii. Pseudoplectania nigrella is smaller, with a hairier outer surface, a darker inner cup surface, and a rudimentary stem.|$|E

5|$|Blackcaps have a {{complete}} moult in their breeding areas in August and September prior to migration. Some birds, typically those migrating the greatest distances, have a further partial moult between December and March. Juveniles replace their loosely structured body feathers with adult plumage, starting earlier, but taking longer to complete, than the adults. Blackcaps breeding {{in the north of}} the range have an earlier <b>and</b> <b>shorter</b> post-juvenile moult than those further south, and cross-breeding of captive birds shows that the timing is genetically controlled.|$|E

He underwent a failed operation to correct it just prior to starting grammar school. Goebbels wore a metal brace and special shoe because of his shortened leg, and walked with a limp. He was rejected for military service in World War I due to his deformity.|$|E
5|$|Lock Haven's economy, {{from the}} city's {{founding}} in 1833 {{until the end}} of the 19th century, depended heavily on natural resources, particularly timber, and on cheap transportation to eastern markets. Loggers used the Susquehanna River and Bald Eagle Creek to float timber to sawmills in Lock Haven and nearby towns. The West Branch Canal, reaching the city in 1834, connected to large markets downstream, <b>and</b> <b>shorter</b> canals along Bald Eagle Creek added other connections. In 1859, the first railroad arrived in Lock Haven, spurring trade and economic growth.|$|E

5|$|The {{barn owl}} has a wider {{distribution}} {{than any other}} species of owl. Many subspecies have been proposed over the years but several are {{generally considered to be}} intergrades between more distinct populations. Twenty to thirty are usually recognised, varying mainly in body proportions, size and colour. Island forms are mostly smaller than mainland ones, and those inhabiting forests have darker plumage <b>and</b> <b>shorter</b> wings than those occurring in open grasslands. Barn owls range in colour from the almost beige-and-white nominate subspecies, erlangeri and niveicauda, to the nearly black-and-brown contempta.|$|E

5|$|Andreacarus voalavo is a {{parasitic}} mite {{found on}} the Malagasy rodent Voalavo gymnocaudus. First described in 2007, it {{is closely related to}} Andreacarus gymnuromys and Andreacarus eliurus, which are found on other Malagasy rodents. The length of the idiosoma, the main body, is 630 to 670μm in females and 450 to 480μm in males. Unlike A.eliurus, this species lacks distinct sternal glands (secretory organs) between two lyrifissures (sensory organs) on {{the lower part of the}} female body. The pilus dentilis, a sensory organ on the chelicera, is serrate, which distinguishes it from A.gymnuromys. Females of A.gymnuromys also have a less ornamented sternal shield (covering part of the underparts) <b>and</b> <b>shorter</b> setae (bristles) on the upperparts.|$|E
