5|$|Henry VIII's first {{marriage}} had {{its origins in}} 1502 when his elder brother, Arthur, died. Their father, Henry VII, then betrothed Arthur's widow, Catherine of Aragon, to the future king. The betrothal immediately raised questions related to the biblical prohibition (in Leviticus 18 and 20) against marriage to a brother's wife. The couple married in 1509 and {{after a series of}} miscarriages, a daughter, Mary, was born in 1516. By the 1520s, Henry still did not have a son to name as heir and he took this as a sure sign of God's anger and made overtures to the Vatican about an annulment. He gave Cardinal Wolsey the task of prosecuting his case; Wolsey began by consulting university experts. From 1527, in addition to his duties as a Cambridge don, Cranmer assisted with the <b>annulment</b> <b>proceedings.</b>|$|E
5|$|While Cranmer was {{following}} Charles through Italy, {{he received a}} royal letter dated 1 October 1532 informing {{him that he had}} been appointed the new Archbishop of Canterbury, following the death of archbishop William Warham. Cranmer was ordered to return to England. The appointment had been secured by the family of Anne Boleyn, who was being courted by Henry. When Cranmer's promotion became known in London, it caused great surprise as Cranmer had previously held only minor positions in the Church. Cranmer left Mantua on 19 November and arrived in England at the beginning of January. Henry personally financed the papal bulls necessary for Cranmer's promotion to Canterbury. The bulls were easily acquired because the papal nuncio was under orders from Rome to please the English in an effort to prevent a final breach. The bulls arrived around 26 March 1533 and Cranmer was consecrated as archbishop on 30 March in St Stephen's Chapel. Even while they were waiting for the bulls, Cranmer continued to work on the <b>annulment</b> <b>proceedings,</b> which required greater urgency after Anne announced her pregnancy. Henry and Anne were secretly married on 24 or 25 January 1533 {{in the presence of a}} handful of witnesses. Cranmer did not learn of the marriage until a fortnight later.|$|E

Provisions related to this law often change, which makes their application difficult. The article describes public procurement procedures {{in the field of}} construction in Poland which is limited to two basic modes of tender. The most common mistakes made by customers related to the implementation of this procedure had also been presented. The author analyzed procedures related to public procurement in Poland. She also met with and conducted interviews with a few representatives of Polish gminas responsible for the organization and conduct of construction tenders. The aim of these interviews was to discover problems related to the implementation of public procurement procedures and the most common mistakes that had been made. Furthermore, the author had analyzed the available tender documentation taking into account problematic documents. The tender procedure had been clearly presented in the article in points and table listings. Aspects pertaining to problems and the reasons why mistakes had been made by customers had also been presented. These mistakes are mainly related to the subject of order, concern the conditions of participation in the proceedings and the specification of essential terms and conditions of the order. Consequences of these mistakes may be appeals and <b>annulment</b> of <b>proceedings...</b>|$|R

50|$|Henry's {{marriage}} to Catherine of Aragon had produced no sons who survived infancy; the Wars of the Roses were still within living memory, {{leading to the}} fear of a power struggle after Henry's death. Henry felt the people would only accept a male king, and not his daughter Mary. Henry believed God had cursed him for the sin of marrying the widow of his elder brother. He also believed that the papal dispensation for his {{marriage to}} Catherine was invalid because it was based upon the claim that Catherine was still a virgin after her first husband's death. Henry argued that Catherine's claim was not credible, and thus, the original papal dispensation must be withdrawn and their marriage annulled.

50|$|The brotherhood found {{support from}} the critic John Ruskin, who praised its devotion to nature and {{rejection}} of conventional methods of composition. The Pre-Raphaelites were influenced by Ruskin's theories. He wrote to The Times defending their work and subsequently met them.

The main object of the journey was to paint Ruskin's portrait. Effie became increasingly attached to Millais, creating a crisis. In subsequent <b>annulment</b> <b>proceedings,</b> Ruskin himself made a statement to his lawyer to the effect that his marriage had been unconsummated. The marriage was annulled on grounds of non-consummation, leaving Effie free to marry Millais, but causing a public scandal. Millais began {{to move away from the}} Pre-Raphaelite style after his marriage, and Ruskin ultimately attacked his later works. Ruskin continued to support Hunt and Rossetti and provided funds to encourage the art of Rossetti's wife Elizabeth Siddal.|$|E

40|$|ANNULMENT OF AWARDS UNDER THE WASHINGTON CONVENTION ON SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES The {{annulment}} mechanism plays {{a significant}} role in the system established by the Washington Convention. As a model of review, it strives to reconcile respect for the parties' desire to achieve final and efficient resolution of their dispute with the limited possibility to quash an award which is a product of a fundamentally flawed process. The existence of this exceptional opportunity to annul an award after its issuance has been widely recognized as an important factor in the success of ICSID as a platform for settlement of investment disputes. This thesis focuses on the issue of scope of review exercised by the ad hoc committees in <b>annulment</b> <b>proceedings.</b> The very first generation of ad hoc committees, represented by the annulment decisions in Amco I and Klöckner I, cast a shadow of doubt on ICSID's ability to transform its avowed dedication to the principle of finality into practice. Both of these decisions were accused of crossing the line between limited review anticipated by the Convention and substantive review typical for appellate systems. The primary ambition of this thesis is to explore the legitimacy of these concerns with respect to the current generation of ad hoc committees. Therefore, the first [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{right to}} due process is an {{important}} part of both civil and arbitration proceedings. However, this basic right is protected in different ways and even the mechanisms for checking whether the process adhered to the due process rules are different. For standard civil proceedings in Europe, European Court for Human rights is the final body which decides whether the rules on due process were adhered to. Commercial arbitration does not have a mechanism for checking whether the proceedings were justly carried within itself, therefore it is checked within the enforcement proceedings which are in most states covered by the New York Convention. In investment arbitration, the adherence to due process will be analyzed within the <b>annulment</b> <b>proceedings.</b> The thesis "Right to Due Process: the comparison of arbitration and human rights case law" deals with the question whether the argumentation of the European Court of Human Rights in its rich case law can be used on arbitration cases where the accessibility of case law is problematic.

40|$|The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) {{is celebrating}} its halfcentury {{existence}} this year. Having presided over more than 525 cases in various topics including annulment; {{it is no surprise}} that it is described as the premier international investment arbitration institution in the world. Annulment was designed as an exceptional remedy to safeguard against violation of fundamental legal principles. This provision, enshrined in the ICSID Convention of 1966, stands out as the 'art', 'crown' and 'jewel' of ICSID jurisprudence. The annual number of cases registered by ICSID increased rapidly in the last decade. To date, there are 160 signatories and contracting states to the ICSID Convention. Awards rendered under this mechanism are binding and have been successfully implemented without interference by domestic courts. What this statistic fails to show is that the rate of annulment has increased considerably. This implies that out of every 344 arbitration cases registered; 150 ICSID Convention awards have been rendered and 53 <b>annulment</b> <b>proceedings</b> instituted. This is against the background that only few annulment applications existed in the institutions' early years. This remedy has been pursued by both claimants and respondents to ICSID proceedings. Approximately 57 percent of <b>annulment</b> <b>proceedings</b> have been initiated by respondents (in all instances, states), 36 percent by claimants and 7 percent by both parties. The annulment mechanism is deployed by ICSID in lieu of providing an appellate option. Dissatisfied parties have employed this mechanism to challenge awards rendered by the institution. It follows that, despite the institution's uniqueness and widely recognised success in international arbitration, annulment negates the principle of finality and certainty ? one of the core principles of arbitration. The above flaw has led to the withdrawal of Latin America countries from the ICSID Convention. Bolivia was the first to withdraw as it denounced its membership in 2007. This was followed by Ecuador in 2010 and Venezuela in 2012. Countries like the United States, South Africa and Germany have also revisited this provision and called for review of the whole system. This research calls for reform of the ICSID annulment mechanism. It arrives at practical alternatives to be adopted by the institution aimed at creating finality and predictability in the international arbitration system. This mini-dissertation argues that finality and predictability can be achieved under ICSID by establishing an appellate mechanism drawing lessons from the institutional framework of the World Trade Organization Appellate Body Dispute Settlement System (WTO - DSS). If the annulment mechanism negates the principle of finality in international arbitration, then the ICSID objective of attaining predictability in international arbitration remains fictitious. This research therefore adds to the growing voice that argues that amendment of the annulment procedure is long overdue. tm 2017 Centre for Human RightsLLMUnrestricte...|$|E
40|$|Unlike {{many other}} European jurisdictions, Dutch law treats the {{liability}} of the gov-ernment in {{essentially the same}} way as the liability of private parties. This can be explained by the fact that governmental liability has mainly been developed by the civil courts, which apply ordinary civil law. In 1992, the legislator explicitly refrained from creating specific liability law for public law decisions, arguing that the Civil Code was sufficiently flexible to take the special position of public authorities into ac-count. This argument is the object of my thesis: do the rules of private law take sufficient account of the political aspects of governmental liability for public law deci-sions? My analysis has focused on two categories that illustrate the specific position of the government in the context of liability law. First, sometimes it is deemed desirable that the government pays damages notwithstanding the fact that the contested decision is perfectly lawful. In my view the Civil Code, flexible as it may be, does not provide a legal basis for such liability. That may explain why the civil courts have created liability for lawful governmental acts under par. 6 : 162 of the Civil Code, which provides for liability for unlawful acts. By contrast, the administrative courts have created a separate liability for lawful acts on the basis of unwritten law. However, this approach is difficult to reconcile with the rule that legal obligations can only arise from statutory law. Consequently, in my opinion the legislator has to introduce specific legislation to give the existing liability for lawful governmental acts its necessary statutory underpinning. Second, in some cases it is deemed desirable that the government is not liable, notwithstanding the fact that the contested decision is considered to be faulty. This is especially the case when the decision is subject to appeal to an administrative court. Both the civil and the administrative courts have therefore adopted the doctrine of formal legal effect. Pursuant to this doctrine a decision which has not been quashed or revoked in an administrative procedure is regarded as lawful, even if it is manifestly against the law. This doctrine can lead to unnecessary court proceedings. For example, the fisherman from whom a fishing permit for the year 2000 is withheld, is com-pelled to pursue administrative proceedings to obtain a permit even if the year 2000 has long since passed, if he is to maintain a claim for damages. However, the doctrine has proven useful in cases where a claim for damages would boil down to <b>annulment</b> <b>proceedings.</b> In my opinion, in both examples the flaws in the courts’ reasoning stem from a focus on the unlawfulness of the decision (the fundamentum petendi). In my thesis I advocate a shift of focus to the claim itself (the petitum). Disconnecting the action for damages from the action for annulment will enable the courts to maintain the validity of (inevitable) governmental decisions without denying the victims of the decision due compensation. Thus, substantial changes in legislation can be avoided...|$|E
