25|$|St Chad's Well near Battle Bridge on {{the river}} Fleet in London was a celebrated {{medicinal}} well and had a new pump house built in 1832. It was destroyed by the Midland Railway company, and is remembered in the street name of St Chad's Place. There is no independent evidence of Chad's visiting the site, but it clearly is named after him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> did travel in southern England. His association with wells seems ancient, and no doubt stems from the St Chad's Well at Lichfield, visited by pilgrims and probably the water supply of his monastery. This {{is the most likely}} explanation of the name.|$|E
25|$|Superficially, {{the ceiling}} is a Humanist construction. The figures are of superhuman {{dimension}} and, {{in the case}} of Adam, of such beauty that according to the biographer Vasari, it really looks as if God himself had designed the figure, rather than Michelangelo. But despite the beauty of the individual figures, Michelangelo has not glorified the human state, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> has not presented the Humanist ideal of platonic love. In fact, the ancestors of Christ, which he painted around the upper section of the wall, demonstrate all the worst aspects of family relationships, displaying dysfunction in as many different forms as there are families.|$|E

25|$|In 219 BC, Hannibal {{attacked}} {{the town of}} Saguntum, which stood under the special protection of Rome. According to Roman tradition, Hannibal {{had been made to}} swear by his father never to be a friend of Rome, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> did not take a conciliatory attitude when the Romans berated him for crossing the river Iberus (Ebro), which Carthage was bound by treaty not to cross. Hannibal did not cross the Ebro River (Saguntum was near modern Valencia – well south of the river) in arms, and the Saguntines provoked his attack by attacking their neighboring tribes who were Carthaginian protectorates and by massacring pro-Punic factions in their city. Rome had no legal protection pact with any tribe south of the Ebro River. Nonetheless, they asked Carthage to hand Hannibal over, and when the Carthaginian oligarchy refused, Rome declared war on Carthage.|$|E
25|$|On 7 July 1645, demonstrating {{against the}} points of passage between Ilchester and Langport, Fairfax {{secretly}} occupied Yeovil. The post at that place, which had been the right of Goring's first position, had perhaps rightly been withdrawn to Ilchester, when the second position was taken up. Fairfax repaired the bridge without interruption. Goring showed himself unequal to the new situation. He might, if sober, make a good plan when the enemy was not present to disturb him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> led cavalry charges with boldness and skill. But of strategy {{in front of the}} enemy, he was incapable. On the news from Yeovil, he abandoned the line of the Yeo, as far as Langport, without striking a blow. Fairfax, having nothing to gain by continuing his detour through Yeovil, came back and quietly crossed at Long Sutton, west of Ilchester on 9 July.|$|E

Andrew Roberts, an English historian, states that the severity of the King's stammer was exaggerated and the characters of Edward VIII, Wallis Simpson, and George V made more antagonistic than they really were, to increase the dramatic effect.|$|E

Michael Abram, a 36-year-old fan, broke in and attacked Harrison with a kitchen knife, puncturing a lung and causing head injuries before Olivia Harrison incapacitated the assailant by striking him repeatedly with a fireplace poker and a lamp. Following the attack, Harrison was hospitalised with more than 40 stab wounds. He released a statement soon afterwards regarding his assailant: [...] " [...] wasn't a burglar, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> wasn't auditioning for the Traveling Wilburys." ...|$|E
500|$|Howard was {{selected}} by the Denver Broncos in the fifth round of the 1998 NFL Draft, {{but he had a}} difficult pre-season with the Broncos in 1998, fumbling five times in two games. [...] The Broncos released him from their practice squad in September 1998, and he was signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars. [...] At the time, Jacksonville Coach Tom Coughlin said: [...] "Chris Howard is a young man <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> still is developmental. [...] A couple weeks into our system and I think he'll be a guy who can be counted on. But I'm not going to say we're done with our evaluations just yet." [...] Coughlin said of Howard's fumbles with Denver: [...] "It was carelessness. [...] Basically, we'll start from scratch with him fundamentally here." [...] Howard had professional totals of 123yards rushing on 41carries and 37yards receiving on five receptions. [...] In 2000, his final year, he fumbled twice on only 21carries in the first two games. [...] These were his final two career NFL games.|$|E
500|$|Homer is an [...] "everyman" [...] and embodies several American {{stereotypes}} of working class blue-collar men: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, dim witted, clumsy and a borderline alcoholic. Matt Groening describes him as [...] "completely ruled by his impulses". Dan Castellaneta calls him [...] "a dog {{trapped in a}} man's body", adding, [...] "He's incredibly loyal– not entirely clean– but you gotta love him." [...] In his book Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner describes Homer as [...] "the most American of the Simpsons" [...] and believes that while the other Simpson family members could be changed to other nationalities, Homer is [...] "pure American". In the book God in the Details: American Religion in Popular Culture, the authors comment that [...] "Homer's progress (or lack thereof) reveals a character who can do the right thing, if accidentally or begrudgingly." [...] The book [...] includes a chapter analyzing Homer's character {{from the perspective of}} Aristotelian virtue ethics. Raja Halwani writes that Homer's [...] "love of life" [...] is an admirable character trait, [...] "for many people are tempted to see in Homer nothing but buffoonery and immorality. [...] He is not politically correct, he is more than happy to judge others, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> {{does not seem to be}} obsessed with his health. These qualities might not make Homer an admirable person, but they do make him admirable in some ways, and, more importantly, makes us crave him and the Homer Simpsons of this world." [...] In 2008, Entertainment Weekly justified designating The Simpsons as a television classic by stating, [...] "we all hail Simpson patriarch Homer because his joy is as palpable as his stupidity is stunning".|$|E

2500|$|As a {{guide to}} Abdisho’s support the letter must be treated with caution.

[...] His claim to the Erbil, Urmi and Salmas districts {{may also have been}} justified, in view of the support for Sulaqa from their bishops. [...] Alqosh, however, was the stronghold of his rival Shemon VII Ishoyahb, who also controlled Telkepe and Karamlish. [...] Abdisho perhaps felt obliged, as 'patriarch of Mosul', to assert a claim to the Mosul district, and may have had a bishop nominally responsible for the villages of the Mosul plain.|$|E

2500|$|Of the songwriters on the Greenwich Village {{scene of}} the 1960s, Dave Van Ronk said, [...] "Dylan is usually cited as {{the founder of the}} new song movement, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> became its most visible standard-bearer, but the person who started the whole thing was Tom Paxton... he tested his songs in the {{crucible}} of live performance, he found that his own stuff was getting more attention than when he was singing traditional songs or stuff by other people ... he set himself a training regimen of deliberately writing one song every day. [...] Dylan had not yet showed up when this was happening, and by the time Bobby came on the set, with at most two or three songs he had written, Tom was already singing at least 50 percent his own material. [...] That said, it was Bobby's success that really got the ball rolling. [...] Prior to that, the folk community was very much tied to traditional songs, so much so that songwriters would sometimes palm their own stuff off as traditional." ...|$|E
2500|$|This season {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of red kryptonite. In the fourth episode of the second season, titled [...] "Red", Clark buys a high school ring that contains a red kryptonite gem. The effects of the kryptonite were meant {{to act as a}} metaphor for drugs. Loeb was given the task of writing [...] "Red" [...] by Gough and Millar, {{and one of the things}} he decided on was that the ultimate pay off with the kryptonite would be Clark finally kissing Lana. As Tom Welling describes it, [...] "With 'Red Clark' he's completely aware of the consequences of his actions at the time, but he doesn't care! He doesn't care what happens to you, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> doesn't care what happens to himself, because he probably realizes that nothing can happen to him. It's always fun to be that way, even in real life, because we're not allowed to be that way all too often." [...] One of the concerns for the episode was whether the audience would embrace the idea of a [...] "bad Clark", as Ken Biller knew that Clark would have to be [...] "the villain of the story". Fortunately, audiences did embrace the idea and after the good ratings [...] "Red" [...] received, the WB requested more episodes with red kryptonite. Unfortunately, Gough and the crew did not like using it because of the idea of [...] "Clark [...] bad", but the team asked themselves, [...] "what if a friend slips something in your drink and you don’t know it?" [...] This became the basis in [...] "Rush", where Pete slips a shard of red kryptonite into Clark's pocket; it also gave the network what they wanted, but in the form of a single act instead of the entire episode. This element would show up again in the season finale, when Clark slips on another red kryptonite ring before riding out of Smallville on a motorcycle. According to Ken Biller, the moment Clark goes searching for the kryptonite is the payoff they had wanted with that piece of Superman mythology. The show had established that red kryptonite removes Clark's inhibitions, and in the season finale, Clark is to the point that he is willing to [...] "go 'on drugs' to solve his own pain and [...] guilt about what he's done".|$|E
