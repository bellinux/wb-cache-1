Eventually {{he got a job}} as a messenger boy at Eatons, Toronto's largest department store. One of the best aspects of working for the company was {{that he was able to}} visit their summer camp, which gave him his first taste of a real holiday, indeed <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> what was to become a very big part of his life. Later he transferred to Eatons advertising department where he drew black and white adverts, while studying at night school twice a week.|$|E

The novelist Walter Greenwood (Love on the Dole) and the dramatist Shelagh Delaney (<b>A</b> <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Honey) were both born in, and wrote about, Salford. Musicians Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook, who were members of Joy Division– which later reformed as New Order– are both from Salford. Notable Salfordian sportspeople include former England football international and Manchester United F.C. midfielder Paul Scholes, Olympic Javelin Thrower Shelley Holroyd, English former snooker player Mick Price was born in the area and Great Britain and England rugby league international and current Warrington Wolves front-rower Adrian Morley.

5|$|Unable to {{take any}} further part in the war as an infantryman, Phillipps would {{normally}} have been repatriated to Australia, but instead engineered a transfer to the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) as adjutant of No.2 Squadron. After getting <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> flying as a passenger, the twenty-five-year-old applied for pilot training, altering his birthdate from 1892 to 1896. The official age limit for pilots in the AFC was thirty, but the preferred age was under twenty-three. Phillipps' application was accepted in May 1917 and, after qualifying for his wings, his proficiency was considered such that in August he was attached to No.32 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps to gain operational experience in France. Within three days of arriving he crash-landed his Airco DH.5 after it was hit by anti-aircraft fire near Ypres, but he escaped injury; {{by the time he}} completed his attachment in September he was leading combat patrols.|$|E

Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) tries to correct one of the {{statement}}s, but when Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) checks the fact online, it turns out Michael's statement was correct. Everyone mocks Oscar for his mistake, as Oscar is usually the smartest one in the office, having built this reputation by often correcting his coworkers. Oscar invites Michael {{for a cup of}} coffee, but the other employees realize that Oscar wants to discuss China in more detail, in order to reestablish himself as the office's intellectual heavyweight. Seeing an opportunity to give Oscar <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> his own medicine, they start quizzing Michael on different facts about China, but he cannot answer, so he makes note cards to keep track. When Michael and Oscar have their conversation, Ryan, Erin, Jim, Andy, and Kelly also sit in to watch. Michael blanks on one topic, but then changes the subject to conversation itself. The employees toast him, while Oscar is left infuriated.|$|E
5|$|After {{finding out}} that Arizona cheated on her with Lauren, Callie kicks Arizona out of their apartment. They also let out their true {{feelings}} about the accident and more is revealed about how they actually have felt. Callie initially agrees to couples therapy, but she {{shows up at the}} office only to tell Arizona that she isn't going in. Arizona gets drunk with April for a laugh while Callie, who is at the fundraiser, tells people that Arizona died in the plane crash. Arizona is led to believe that she and Leah slept together, however all they did was dance and make grilled cheese sandwiches after watching Derek perform surgery on film. Arizona pursues a sexual relationship with Leah but cuts ties with her when Callie asks her to come back home. It is revealed that Arizona became pregnant via a sperm donor prior to sleeping with Lauren. They decided to try again for a second child, but after agreeing that Callie would carry it, Callie went to see an OB/GYN and discovered that she had developed adhesions in her uterus since Sofia's birth, meaning she can't carry any more children. When she told Arizona, Arizona offered to carry the baby, but Callie decided that since they're still on unsteady footing that if something goes wrong, they won't make it and she doesn't want to put them in that position. They agree to postpone their plans to have another baby. However, in the season finale of Season 10 it is implied that Callie and Arizona's dream of having other child may come by means of a surrogate. At the beginning of Season 11, Callie and Arizona decide to have a baby by surrogate and Arizona applies for a fetal surgery fellowship with Dr. Herman. Arizona, with a heavy workload because of the fellowship, and Callie have an argument in the waiting room, and they choose to go to therapy together, resulting in a 30-day break. Arizona believes that the break strengthened their relationship and made her realize that she needs Callie - Callie on the other hand declares that the break gave her <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> the freedom that she has been missing. Callie walks away and the two get a divorce later.|$|E
5|$|Andriamampandry {{tried on}} several {{occasions}} to warn Andriamasinavalona {{of the danger of}} administering the kingdom in this way. In one instance, he placed a hen {{in the middle of a}} room, then set one red rooster free in each corner. The roosters attacked one another viciously, leaving the king speechless. On another day, the elder brought four eagles to the king in a basket. When the basket was opened, the eagles flew wildly about the room, creating havoc. Andriamampandry warned the king that his realm would be no better off once his four sons got <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> power. Andriamasinavalona recognized the danger but could not bear to choose which among his sons should be excluded from having a part in the decision-making responsibilities of the kingdom, so ignored the elder's advice. Finally Andriamampandry decided to give the king a very explicit warning. Andriamasinavalona had gathered his people in Andohalo to give a speech, when Andriamampandry set a bull loose into the crowd. In the panic that ensued, numerous people were gored or trampled to death, several pregnant women miscarried, and the gathering dispersed in chaos. The king demanded to know who had loosed the bull so that he may be executed, but when Andriamampandry took responsibility he warned the king that yet more blood would be spilled before the earth would be quenched. He then criticized the king for his concern over the relatively few deaths at the gathering, in light of the number of people who would die as a consequence of his division of Imerina. He further predicted that the prince at Ambohimanga would unite Imerina and lead it back to greatness. Andriamasinavalona reportedly had no response to give Andriamampandry, but instead hung his head in shame.|$|E

5|$|On 30 June 1513, Henry invaded France, and {{his troops}} {{defeated}} a French army at the Battle of the Spurs – {{a relatively minor}} result, but one which was seized on by the English for propaganda purposes. Soon after, the English took Thérouanne and handed it over to Maximillian; Tournai, a more significant settlement, followed. Henry had led the army personally, complete with large entourage. His absence from the country, however, had prompted his brother-in-law, James IV of Scotland, to invade England {{at the behest of}} Louis. Nevertheless, the English army, overseen by Queen Catherine, decisively defeated the Scots at the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513. Among the dead was the Scottish king, thus ending Scotland's brief involvement in the war. These campaigns had given Henry <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> the military success he so desired. However, despite initial indications, he decided not to pursue a 1514 campaign. He had been supporting Ferdinand and Maximilian financially during the campaign but had received little in return; England's coffers were now empty. With the replacement of Julius by Pope Leo X, who was inclined to negotiate for peace with France, Henry signed his own treaty with Louis: his sister Mary would become Louis' wife, having previously been pledged to the younger Charles, and peace was secured for eight years, a remarkably long time.|$|E
5|$|When Marge and the {{children}} arrive at El Chemistri, Homer unknowingly arrives at an illegal meth lab that he thinks is the actual restaurant. While the trio eat their meal (deconstructed Caesar salad) with other foodies, Marge feels guilty about misdirecting Homer. Meanwhile, Homer meets the meth dealer and other drug addicts, whom he believes to be food hipsters. Just as {{he is about to}} have <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> the meth (which he thinks is food produced with the help of molecular gastronomy), the police burst in and a gunfight ensues between them and the drug addicts. At El Chemistri, Marge receives a panicked text message from Homer requesting help, and she asks the other foodies to help save her husband. They refuse, so she, Bart, and Lisa head by themselves towards the meth lab after receiving doggie bags from the chef who is angry that they are leaving. After arriving, Marge throws apple pie from her doggie bag into the mouth of the meth dealer. This causes a flashback inside his mind to his childhood days when his mother used to make apple pie. With the help of this distraction, the police subdue him. After Marge apologizes to Homer, they and their children decide to have fun together as a whole family from now on.|$|E
