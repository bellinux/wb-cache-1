Pileus is a cap cloud that can form over a cumulonimbus or large cumulus cloud, whereas a velum feature is a thin horizontal sheet that sometimes forms like an apron around the middle or {{in front of the}} parent cloud.

50|$|It is {{very rare}} for any <b>accessory</b> <b>cloud</b> to {{generate}} its own precipitation. However, the parent cloud may generate precipitation. Precipitation from the parent cloud is often confused with the <b>accessory</b> <b>cloud</b> and observers think that the precipitation is actually falling from the <b>accessory</b> <b>cloud.</b>|$|E
50|$|Nimbostratus pannus is an <b>accessory</b> <b>cloud</b> of {{nimbostratus}} {{that forms}} as a ragged layer in precipitation below the main cloud deck.|$|E

50|$|The arcus {{and roll}} clouds, shelf cloud, wall cloud, and scud are {{examples}} of low level or vertical <b>accessory</b> <b>clouds</b> whilst the anvil, and overshooting top, {{are examples of}} high level <b>accessory</b> <b>clouds.</b> The condensation funnel of funnel clouds and tornadoes are also <b>accessory</b> <b>clouds.</b> They are associated with deep moist convection and especially cumulonimbus, the primary cloud producing thunderstorms. The pileus and mammatus types can form at various altitude ranges depending on the main clouds {{with which they are}} associated. The World Meteorological Organization classifies most <b>accessory</b> <b>clouds</b> as supplementary features. The height range classification of a supplementary feature {{is the same as the}} parent cloud. As an example, the anvil cloud (supplementary feature incus) forms at high altitude but is not classisfied by the WMO as a high cloud because of its association with the genus cumulonimbus.|$|R

5000|$|An <b>accessory</b> <b>cloud</b> is a cloud {{which is}} {{dependent}} on a larger cloud system for its development and continuance. It is often an appendage but also can be adjacent to the parent cloud system.|$|E
5000|$|The 2017 {{edition of}} the International Cloud Atlas has added 12 new cloud {{formations}} - one new species, five new supplemental features, one new <b>accessory</b> <b>cloud</b> type, and five new special clouds.

50|$|Another <b>accessory</b> <b>cloud</b> is the flumen, {{commonly}} known as the beaver's tail. It is formed by the warm, humid inflow of a strong thunderstorm, and is often mistaken for tornadoes. Although the presence of a flumen is associated with tornado risk, the flumen, similar to scud clouds, does not rotate.|$|E
5000|$|Supplementary features: Cirrostratus {{produces}} no precipitation or virga, {{and is not}} {{accompanied by}} any <b>accessory</b> <b>clouds.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Supplementary {{features}} and <b>accessory</b> <b>clouds</b> are not further subdivisions of cloud types below the species and variety level. Rather, {{they are either}} hydrometeors or special cloud types with their own Latin names that form in association with certain cloud genera, species, and varieties. [...] Supplementary features, whether {{in the form of}} clouds or precipitation, are directly attached to the main genus-cloud. [...] <b>Accessory</b> <b>clouds,</b> by contrast, are generally detached from the main cloud.|$|R
50|$|The largest free-convective clouds {{comprise}} the genus cumulonimbus which are multi-level {{because of their}} towering vertical extent. They occur in highly unstable air and often have complex structures that include cirriform tops and multiple <b>accessory</b> <b>clouds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An arcus cloud is a low, {{horizontal}} cloud formation, usually {{appearing as}} an <b>accessory</b> <b>cloud</b> to a cumulonimbus. Roll clouds and shelf clouds {{are the two}} main types of arcus. Arcus clouds most frequently form along the leading edge or [...] "gust fronts" [...] of thunderstorm outflow; {{some of the most}} dramatic arcus formations mark the gust fronts of derecho-producing convective systems. Roll clouds also may arise in the absence of thunderstorms, forming along the shallow cold air currents of some sea breeze boundaries and cold fronts.|$|E

5000|$|Stratus <b>clouds</b> don't produce <b>accessory</b> <b>clouds,</b> but a {{supplementary}} feature praecipitatio {{is derived}} from Latin, which means [...] "precipitation". Stratus clouds are too low to produce virga, or rain shears that evaporate before reaching the ground.|$|R
2500|$|The largest free-convective clouds {{comprise}} the genus cumulonimbus which are multi-level {{because of their}} towering vertical extent. [...] They occur in highly unstable air and often have complex structures that include cirriform tops and multiple <b>accessory</b> <b>clouds.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Supplementary cloud {{formations}} {{detached from}} the main cloud are known as <b>accessory</b> <b>clouds.</b> [...] The heavier precipitating clouds, nimbostratus, towering cumulus (cumulus congestus), and cumulonimbus typically see the formation in precipitation of the pannus feature, low ragged clouds of the genera and species cumulus fractus or stratus fractus.|$|R
50|$|Fractus are <b>accessory</b> <b>clouds,</b> {{named for}} the type of cloud from which they were sheared. The two {{principal}} forms are cumulus fractus (formerly, fractocumulus) and stratus fractus (formerly, fractostratus). Fractus clouds may develop into cumulus if the ground heats enough to start convection. Stratus fractus is distinguishable from cumulus fractus by its smaller vertical extent, darker color, and by the greater dispersion of its particles.|$|R
40|$|My {{research}} {{interest is}} cloud formations and how clouds relay {{the conditions of}} the sky to pilots. There are dozens of particular cloud types and variations, some with many specific <b>accessory</b> <b>clouds</b> and supplementary features. Clouds are also beautiful and {{have been the subject of}} poets and romantics since time immemorial. Clouds can tell us a story about the weather and help us ponder beauty if we take a moment to look up...|$|R
25|$|The species fractus shows {{variable}} instability {{because it}} can be a subdivision of genus-types of different physical forms that have different stability characteristics. This subtype can be in the form of ragged but mostly stable stratiform sheets (stratus fractus) or small ragged cumuliform heaps with somewhat greater instability (cumulus fractus). When they form at low altitudes, stratiform and cumuliform genus-types can be torn up into shreds by brisk low level winds that create mechanical turbulence against the ground. Fractus clouds can form in precipitation at low altitudes, with or without brisk or gusty winds. They are closely associated with precipitating cloud systems of considerable vertical and sometimes horizontal extent, so they are also classified as <b>accessory</b> <b>clouds</b> under the name pannus (see section on supplementary features).|$|R
5000|$|Clouds in the troposphere, the {{atmospheric}} layer closest to Earth, are classified {{according to the}} height at which they are found, and their shape or appearance. [...] There are five forms based on physical structure and process of formation. Cirriform clouds are high, thin and wispy, and are seen most extensively along the leading edges of organized weather disturbances. Stratiform clouds are non-convective and appear as extensive sheet-like layers, ranging from thin to very thick with considerable vertical development. They are mostly the product of large-scale lifting of stable air. Unstable free-convective cumuliform clouds are formed mostly into localized heaps. Stratocumuliform clouds of limited convection show a mix of cumuliform and stratiform characteristics which appear {{in the form of}} rolls or ripples. Highly convective cumulonimbiform clouds have complex structures often including cirriform tops and stratocumuliform <b>accessory</b> <b>clouds.</b>|$|R

40|$|In recent years, cloud {{printing}} {{is becoming}} a popular topic {{in the field of}} communication and the organizations (public or private) are shifting their physical infrastructure to cloud storage. Mobile phones are the dominant access device for consumer and have been an essential part of life. Mobile phones with smart features are the recent driver behind the cloud printing. Now mobile phones can be attached wirelessly to the printers from any location and anytime in the world via cloud technology that enables to send a personalized print jobfrom a mobile phone to the printer. In this process, print processing is carried on cloud server rather than hardware. Prior to this technology, printers are attached with mobile phones over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth and USBtechnology that has some merits and demerits along with physical <b>accessories.</b> Therefore, <b>Cloud</b> printing is an innovative printing technology that improves the existing technologies and eliminates the physical attachment and geographicalbarriers.
