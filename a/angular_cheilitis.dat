25|$|Several GI diseases, {{especially}} {{those associated with}} malabsorption, can cause recurrent mouth ulcers, atrophic glossitis, and <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> (e.g. Crohn's disease is sometimes termed orofacial granulomatosis when it involves the mouth alone).|$|E

Sometimes <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> can coexist, which is {{inflammation of the}} corners of the mouth, also often associated with Candida albicans. Stomatitis rarely develops under a lower denture. The affected mucosa is often sharply defined, {{in the shape of the}} covering denture.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> {{could be}} {{considered}} to be a type of cheilitis or stomatitis. Where Candida species are involved, <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> is classed as a type of oral candidiasis, specifically a primary (group I) Candida-associated lesion. This form <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> which is caused by Candida is sometimes termed [...] "Candida-associated angular cheilitis", or less commonly, [...] "monilial perlèche". <b>Angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> can also be classified as acute (sudden, short-lived appearance of the condition) or chronic (lasts a long time or keeps returning), or refractory (the condition persists despite attempts to treat it).|$|E
50|$|<b>Angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> {{is thought}} to be multifactorial {{disorder}} of infectious origin, with many local and systemic predisposing factors. The sores in <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> are often infected with fungi (yeasts), bacteria, or a combination thereof; this may represent a secondary, opportunistic infection by these pathogens. Some studies have linked the initial onset of <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> with nutritional deficiencies, especially of the B(B2-riboflavin) vitamins and iron (which causes iron deficiency anemia), which in turn may be evidence of malnutrition or malabsorption. <b>Angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> can be a manifestation of contact dermatitis, which is considered in two groups; irritational and allergic.|$|E

50|$|<b>Angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> (AC), is {{inflammation}} {{of one or}} both corners of the mouth. Often the corners are red with skin breakdown and crusting. It can also be itchy or painful. The condition can last for days to years. <b>Angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> {{is a type of}} cheilitis ({{inflammation of}} the lips).|$|E

5000|$|... 22% {{of cases}} of <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> are due to irritants. Saliva {{contains}} digestive enzymes, which may have a degree of digestive action on tissues if they are left in contact. The corner of the mouth is normally exposed to saliva {{more than any other}} part of the lips. Reduced lower facial height (vertical dimension or facial support) is usually caused by edentulism (tooth loss), or wearing worn down, old dentures or ones which are not designed optimally. This results in overclosure of the mandible (collapse of the jaws), which extenuates the angular skin folds at the corners of the mouth, in effect creating an intertriginous skin crease. The tendency of saliva to pool in these areas is increased, constantly wetting the area, which may cause tissue maceration and favors the development of a yeast infection. As such, <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> is more commonly seen in edentulous people (people without any teeth). It is by contrast uncommon in persons who retain their natural teeth. [...] <b>Angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> is also commonly seen in denture wearers. <b>Angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> is present in about 30% of people with denture-related stomatitis. It is thought that reduced vertical dimension of the lower face may be a contributing factor in up to 11% of elderly persons with <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> and in up to 18% of denture wearers who have <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis.</b> Reduced vertical dimension can also be caused by tooth migration, wearing orthodontic appliances, and elastic tissue damage caused by ultraviolet light exposure and smoking.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{systemic}} {{disorders are}} involved in <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> {{by virtue of their}} association with malabsorption and the creation of nutritional deficiencies described above. Such examples include people with anorexia nervosa. [...] Other disorders may cause lip enlargement (e.g. orofacial granulomatosis), which alters the local anatomy and extenuates the skin folds at the corners of the mouth. More still may be involved because they affect the immune system, allowing normally harmless organisms like Candida to become pathogenic and cause an infection. Xerostomia (dry mouth) is thought to account for about 5% of cases of AC. Xerostomia itself has many possible causes, but commonly the cause may be side effects of medications, or conditions such as Sjögren's syndrome. Conversely, conditions which cause drooling or sialorrhoea (excessive salivation) can cause <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> by creating a constant wet environment in the corners of the mouth. About 25% of people with Down syndrome appear to have AC. This is due to relative macroglossia, an apparently large tongue in a small mouth, which may constantly stick out of the mouth causing maceration of the corners of the mouth with saliva. Inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) can be associated with <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis.</b> In Crohn's, it is likely the result of malabsorption and immunosuppressive therapy which gives rise to the sores {{at the corner of the}} mouth. Glucagonomas are rare pancreatic endocrine tumors which secrete glucagon, and cause a syndrome of dermatitis, glucose intolerance, weight loss and anemia. AC is a common feature of glucagonoma syndrome. Infrequently, <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> may be one of the manifestations of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, and sometimes cases of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis may accompany <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis.</b> <b>Angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> may be present in human immunodeficiency virus infection, neutropenia, or diabetes. <b>Angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> is more common in people with eczema because their skin is more sensitive to irritants. Other conditions possibly associated include plasma cell gingivitis, Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, or sideropenic dysphagia (also called Plummer-Vinson syndrome or Paterson-Brown-Kelly syndrome).|$|E

5000|$|Several GI diseases, {{especially}} {{those associated with}} malabsorption, can cause recurrent mouth ulcers, atrophic glossitis, and <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> (e.g. Crohn's disease is sometimes termed orofacial granulomatosis when it involves the mouth alone).|$|E
50|$|Plasma cell {{cheilitis}} {{appears as}} well defined, infiltrated, dark red plaque with a superficial lacquer-like glazing. Plasma cell cheilitis usually involves the lower lip. The lips appear dry, atrophic and fissured. <b>Angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> is sometimes present.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> is {{inflammation}} at {{the corners}} (angles) of the mouth, very commonly involving Candida species, when sometimes the terms [...] "Candida-associated angular cheilitis", or less commonly [...] "monilial perlèche" [...] are used. Candida organisms alone are responsible for about 20% of cases, and a mixed infection of C. albicans and Staphylococcus aureus for about 60% of cases. Signs and symptoms include soreness, erythema (redness), and fissuring of one, or more commonly both the angles of the mouth, with edema (swelling) seen intraorally on the commissures (inside {{the corners of the}} mouth). <b>Angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> generally occurs in elderly people and is associated with denture related stomatitis.|$|E
5000|$|Vitamin B1 {{deficiency}} (thiamin deficiency) {{can cause}} glossitis. Vitamin B2 deficiency (ariboflavinosis) can cause glossitis, along with <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis,</b> cheilosis, peripheral neuropathy and other signs and symptoms. The glossitis in vitamin B2 deficiency {{is described as}} magenta. [...] Vitamin B3 deficiency (pellagra) can cause glossitis. Vitamin B6 deficiency (pyridoxine deficiency) can cause glossitis, along with <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis,</b> cheilosis, peripheral neuropathy and seborrheic dermatitis. Folate deficiency (vitamin B9 deficiency) can cause glossitis, along with macrocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, diarrhea, fatigue and possibly neurological signs. Apart from pernicious anemia discussed above, any other cause of vitamin B12 deficiency can cause glossitis, which tends to be painful, smooth and shiny.|$|E
50|$|Angular chielitis is {{normally}} a diagnosis made clinically. If the sore is unilateral, rather than bilateral, this suggests a local factor (e.g., trauma) or a split syphilitic papule. <b>Angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> caused by mandibular overclosure, drooling, and other irritants is usually bilateral.|$|E
50|$|The classic {{clinical}} syndrome for vitamin B6 deficiency is a seborrhoeic dermatitis-like eruption, atrophic glossitis with ulceration, <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis,</b> conjunctivitis, intertrigo, and neurologic {{symptoms of}} somnolence, confusion, and neuropathy (due to impaired sphingosine synthesis) and sideroblastic anemia (due to impaired heme synthesis).|$|E
50|$|Most {{cases of}} <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> respond quickly when {{antifungal}} treatment is used. In more long standing cases, {{the severity of}} the condition often follows a relapsing and remitting course over time. The condition can be difficult to treat and can be prolonged.|$|E
5000|$|Inflammation of {{the lips}} is termed {{cheilitis}}. This {{can be in}} several forms such as chapped lips (dry, peeling lips), <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> (inflammation of {{the corners of the}} mouth), herpes labialis (cold sore, a form of herpes simplex) and actinic cheilitis (chronically sun damaged lips).|$|E
50|$|Candida can be {{detected}} in 93% of <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> lesions. This organism {{is found in the}} mouths of about 40% of healthy individuals, and it is considered by some to be normal commensal component of the oral microbiota. However, Candida shows dimorphism, namely a yeast form which is thought to be relatively harmless and a pathogenic hyphal form which is associated with invasion of host tissues. Potassium hydroxide preparation is recommended by some to help distinguish between the harmless and the pathogenic forms, and thereby highlight which cases of <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> are truly caused by Candida. The mouth may act as a reservoir of Candida that reinfects the sores at the corners of the mouth and prevents the sores from healing.|$|E
50|$|There are 4 {{aspects to}} the {{treatment}} of <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis.</b> Firstly, potential reservoirs of infection inside the mouth are identified and treated. Oral candidiasis, especially denture-related stomatitis is often found to be present where there is <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis,</b> and if it is not treated, the sores at the corners of the mouth may often recur. This involves having dentures properly fitted and disinfected. Commercial preparations are marketed for this purpose, although dentures may be left in dilute (1:10 concentration) household bleach overnight, but only if they are entirely plastic and do not contain any metal parts, and with rinsing under clean water before use. Improved denture hygiene is often required thereafter, including not wearing the denture during sleep and cleaning it daily. For more information, see Denture-related stomatitis.|$|E
5000|$|Herpes labialis (cold sore) is {{a common}} cause of {{infectious}} cheilitis. A lesion caused by recurrence of a latent herpes simplex infection can occur {{in the corner of}} the mouth, and be mistaken for other causes of <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis.</b> In fact this is herpes labialis, and is sometimes termed [...] "angular herpes simplex".|$|E
50|$|Allergic {{reactions}} {{may account}} for about 25-34% of cases of generalized cheilitis (i.e., inflammation {{not confined to the}} angles of the mouth). It is unknown how frequently allergic reactions are responsible for cases of <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis,</b> but any substance capable of causing generalized allergic cheilitis may present involving the corners of the mouth alone.|$|E
50|$|The lesions are {{normally}} swabbed to detect if Candida or pathogenic bacterial species may be present. Persons with <b>angular</b> <b>cheilitis</b> who wear dentures often {{also will have}} their denture swabbed in addition. A complete blood count (full blood count) may be indicated, including assessment of the levels of iron, ferritin, vitamin B12 (and possibly other B vitamins), and folate.|$|E
