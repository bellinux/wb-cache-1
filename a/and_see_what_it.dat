25|$|During filming, it was {{considered}} that the customized 1975 Captain Kirk mask be reused for this film. However, the mask was long gone and a new one was purchased from a local costume shop. The producers wanted to test <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> would look like without the edits. The school scene was filmed and when reviewing the producers did not like how the mask turned out. It was allegedly customized again but did {{not live up to}} the original, and the producers felt it was too old and went for a new mask. Some scenes had to be re-shot with the new mask. The only scene left in is when Loomis is thrown through a glass door; as Michael comes up behind him, the unaltered face and blonde hair is visible.|$|E

500|$|Resident Evil 5s 2007 E3 trailer {{was criticized}} for {{depicting}} a white protagonist killing black enemies in a small African village. According to Newsweek editor N'Gai Croal, [...] "There {{was a lot of}} imagery in that trailer that dovetailed with classic racist imagery", although he acknowledged that only the preview had been released. Takeuchi said the game's producers were completely surprised by the complaints. The second trailer for the game, released on May 31, 2008, revealed a more racially diverse group of enemies and the African BSAA agent Alomar, who assists the protagonist. Critics felt that Alomar's character was added {{to address the issue of}} racism, though Karen Dyer said the character had been in development before the first trailer was released. Takeuchi denied that complaints about racism had any effect in altering the design of Resident Evil 5. He acknowledged that different cultures may have had differing opinions about the trailer, though said he did not expect there to be further complaints once the game was released and people were [...] "able to play the game <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is for themselves". In a Computer and Video Games interview, producer Masachika Kawata also addressed the issue: [...] "We can't please everyone. We're in the entertainment business – we're not here to state our political opinion or anything like that. It's unfortunate that some people felt that way." ...|$|E

500|$|It is {{possible}} to create an express trust without being aware that one is doing so, {{so long as the}} court can determine from the person's intention that a beneficial entitlement should be conferred which the law (or equity) will enforce. In the Constance case, Constance was described as a man of [...] "unsophisticated character" [...] who did not know he was creating a trust– nevertheless, the courts found that was what he had done. [...] In Re Kayford, the company involved took actions to protect its customers by moving their funds into a separate bank account. Even though they had never indicated a desire to create a trust, their intention had been in line with the purpose of a trust, and thus it was considered valid. Many trusts are formed through wills, which create additional issues when determining intention. In Re Hamilton, Lindley LJ set out the standard rule that to [...] "take the will you have to construe <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means, and if you {{come to the conclusion that}} no trust was intended you say so"; essentially that judges should not simply assume that there is a trust. This literal approach was followed until the 1950s; since then, the judiciary have been more willing to interpret trust documents in such a way as to make the trusts valid rather than void. According to Byrnes v Kendle, the question that needs to be answered in determining whether a certainty of intention exists is [...] "What is the meaning of what the parties have said?" [...] and not [...] "What did the parties mean to say?" ...|$|E
