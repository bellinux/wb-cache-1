5|$|David {{has been}} {{featured}} {{in a number of}} promotional materials for the Alien prequel films.

5|$|Dusten Brown is {{a member}} of the Cherokee Nation. Brown served in the United States Army at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Christina Maldonado was a non-Indian single mother of two. Brown and Maldonado became engaged to be married in December 2008, and Maldonado {{informed}} Brown that she was pregnant in January 2009. On learning that Maldonado was pregnant, Brown began to press her to go ahead and marry him, and refused to provide any financial support until after the two had married. In May 2009, Maldonado broke off the engagement by text message and cut all communications with Brown. In June, Maldonado sent Brown <b>a</b> <b>text</b> <b>message</b> asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. Brown responded via text message that he relinquished his rights. No child support order was in place at this time. Furthermore, while laws vary from state to state, it is generally impossible for any parent, male or female, to surrender their parental rights without a court hearing that determines the best interest of the child. A father cannot terminate his parental rights by contract, much less by more informal means (such as by text message).|$|E

Later, Jack continuously asks Liz, but still refuses. This time, she displays her solidarity in front of The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) crew who show her their appreciation. However, as she sees the crew getting sicker, as days go by, she panics and gets the shot.|$|E

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of obesity and diabetes have steadily increased {{over the past three}} decades with projections calling for 83 % of men and 72 % of women becoming overweight or obese by 2020; similarly, the incidence of women with diabetes is projected to increase from 37 % to 44 % (Shute, N., 2011). These drastic increases have brought about a dramatic growth of innovative disease management tools that have proven to increase patient control over their disease as well as enhance patient-practitioner correspondence. The literature provided information involving the use of <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> to prompt the patients to increase their adherence to the treatment regime to help control their BMI levels and overall obesity rates throughout the study. The purpose of the study is to examine the extent to which <b>a</b> <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> intervention can effectively reduce overweight/obesity in adult diabetic patients. More specifically, our research questions are: (1). Is <b>a</b> <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> intervention efficacious at reducing overweight/obesity in adult diabetic patients? (2). Does <b>a</b> <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> intervention have <b>a</b> differential effect on reducing overweight/obesity in adult diabetic patients based on their socio-demographic characteristics, and glucose level? The secondary analysis of 133 diabetic patients in Denver, Colorado concluded that despite the vast amounts of literature supporting the use of <b>text</b> <b>messaging,</b> the weight and BMI of these patients did not alter during the study, shifting from a mean BMI of 33. 7 to 33. 6. This study provided insight into the need for further examination between the factors linking diabetes and obesity as well as the use of technology to help enhance disease adherence. Recommendations for this study include using a larger population with a wider variety of age and socioeconomic status as well as using multiple tools to measure obesity such as abdominal circumference and skin folds tests...|$|R
