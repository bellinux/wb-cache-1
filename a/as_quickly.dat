5|$|Although {{players had}} {{previously}} recorded segments of gameplay, these were usually deathmatches or speedruns, attempts {{to complete a}} map <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> as possible. Diary of a Camper was the first demo to contain a narrative with text-based dialogue, instead of merely showing gameplay. Commentators have called the work primitive, but acknowledge its importance in establishing video games as a medium for filmmaking.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, X Corps, with the 7th Infantry Division and 1st Marine Division, {{attacked}} Incheon, striking the North Korean army from the rear. The attack routed the surprised North Koreans, and by 19 September, the Eighth Army {{pushed out of}} the Pusan Perimeter and advanced north. The 24th Infantry Division advanced to Songju, then to Seoul. The Army advanced north along {{the west coast of}} Korea through October. By mid-October, the North Korean Army had been almost completely destroyed, and US President Harry S. Truman ordered General MacArthur to advance all units into North Korea <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> as possible to end the war. The 24th Infantry Division, with the South Korean 1st Infantry Division, moved to the left flank of the advancing Eighth Army, and moved north along Korea's west coast. The 24th Division then moved north to Chongju. On 1 November, the division's 21st Infantry captured Chonggodo, 18 miles from the Yalu River and Korea's border with China. Units of the Eighth Army and X Corps spread out as they attempted to reach the Yalu and complete the conquest of North Korea <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> as possible.|$|E
5|$|Because of his {{leadership}} at Yarmouk, Khalid ibn al-Walid {{is considered one}} of the finest generals in history and his use of mounted warriors throughout the battle showed just how well he understood the potential strengths and weaknesses of his mounted troops. His mobile guard moved quickly from one point to another, always changing the course of events wherever they appeared, and then just <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> galloping away to change the course of events elsewhere on the field.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the late}} 1960s, fires were {{generally}} {{believed to be}} detrimental for parks and forests, and management policies were aimed at suppressing fires <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> as possible. However, as the beneficial ecological role of fire became better understood in the decades before 1988, a policy was adopted of allowing natural fires to burn under controlled conditions, which proved highly successful in reducing the area lost annually to wildfires.|$|E

5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamsters {{may also}} live near areas of human civilization. In Mongolia, {{they may be}} found in yurts to keep warm during the winter, as they do not have {{thermoregulation}} like the Djungarian hamster. They have five main predators: the Eurasian eagle owl, the steppe eagle, the corsac fox, the common kestrel, and the saker falcon. All distribution areas have more females than males, because males are at higher risk from predators, as they cannot move <b>as</b> <b>quickly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Communication plans {{should be}} made {{beforehand}} to inform of mitigation actions being undertaken. Spare parts and back-up systems should be in place prior to ash fall events to reduce service disruption and return functionality <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> as possible. Good preparedness also includes the identification of ash disposal sites, before ash fall occurs, to avoid further movement of ash and to aid clean-up. Protective equipment such as eye protection and dust masks should be deployed for clean-up teams in advance of ash fall events.|$|E
5|$|Cornwallis was {{sensitive}} {{to the fact that}} Tipu was likely to deny the invading army access to local forage and provisions, so he made arrangements for a large supply of provisions and arranged for the use of elephants to assist in the movement of the army's siege equipment. He also encouraged the Marathas and the Nizam to step up their advances to join his army <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> as possible so that he could take advantage of their cavalry.|$|E

5|$|In 1743 the Cameronians {{established}} {{themselves as}} the Reformed Presbyterian Church, remaining largely separate from religious and political debate. Of independent churches from England that were established {{in the seventeenth century}} only the Quakers managed to endure in to the eighteenth century. Baptist chapels were re-established {{in the middle of the}} century and, although Scotland initially appeared fertile ground for Methodism, it failed to expand <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> as elsewhere in the Great Britain and Ireland. A number of minor Scottish sects developed, such as the Bereans, Buchanites, Daleites and Glassites.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} regain the upper hand, he planned to launch a {{surprise}} assault on the Austrian army stationed in the Cisalpine Republic.

He selected the shortest route through the Alps, the Great St Bernard Pass, which would enable him to reach his destination <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> as possible.|$|E

5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the battle, Herodotus says that the Persian fleet sailed around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly. As has been discussed above, some modern historians place this attempt just before the battle. Either way, the Athenians evidently realised that their city was still under threat, and marched <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> as possible back to Athens.|$|E
5|$|One {{stipulation}} the USACE {{placed on}} the permit, however, was that no work in the Arkansas riverbed could take place after May 1 if it would interfere with the interior least tern nesting period, which was possible if the birds selected nesting sites around the bridge site. As a result, OTA worked to complete the bridge <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> as possible to avoid the possibility of having to suspend the construction. By April 1991, work in the riverbed was mostly complete, with the remaining work on the bridge posing no threat to the terns.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{take time to}} develop, {{and as many as}} half of cases are asymptomatic at the initial presentation. The more severe the injury, the more quickly symptoms become apparent. In severe cases, symptoms may occur <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> as three or fourhours after the trauma. Hypoxemia (low oxygen concentration in the arterial blood) typically becomes progressively worse over 24–48hours after injury. In general, pulmonary contusion tends to worsen slowly over a few days, but it may also cause rapid deterioration or death if untreated.|$|E
