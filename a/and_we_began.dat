"At NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center (now renamed Johnson Space Center) {{we had a}} test subject accidentally {{exposed to}} a near vacuum (less than 1 psi) [...] in an {{incident}} involving a leaking space suit in a vacuum chamber back in '65.

2500|$|The first {{thoughts}} and attempts I made to practice [...] were suggested by a question which {{occurred to me}} in 1946 as I was convalescing from an illness and playing solitaires. The question was {{what are the chances}} that a Canfield solitaire laid out with 52 cards will come out successfully? After {{spending a lot of time}} trying to estimate them by pure combinatorial calculations, I wondered whether a more practical method than [...] "abstract thinking" [...] might not be to lay it out say one hundred times and simply observe and count the number of successful plays. This was already possible to envisage with the beginning of the new era of fast computers, and I immediately thought of problems of neutron diffusion and other questions of mathematical physics, and more generally how to change processes described by certain differential equations into an equivalent form interpretable as a succession of random operations. Later , I described the idea to John von Neumann, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>began</b> to plan actual calculations.|$|E

Stern was {{cautious}} about the offer at first {{as the general}} manager [...] "was not really aware of what I did", but accepted the offer and started on March 2, 1981. During his time relocating from Detroit, Stern spent several weeks planning out a new show, determined to become more successful as the station presented a good chance for him to work in New York City, his career goal. He was determined to [...] "kill my competition. I {{was going to say}} whatever the fuck I was going to say ... The first step was to put my team together". He sought a co-host {{with a sense of humor}} to riff with on news and current events. The station then paired Stern with Robin Quivers, a former nurse in the air force and news reporter at WFBR in Baltimore. Quivers was sent a tape of Stern interviewing a prostitute on the air, and accepted the job without meeting him. She assumed she [...] "would come in and do the news ... but it wasn't that way". Despite several issues management had over content, which led to the installation of a seven-second delay to censor questionable moments, Stern [...] "kept chipping away at management's archaic approach <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>began</b> to assemble the program I had envisioned", which included the addition of Norris as his writer and producer. In one incident, Stern revealed his wife's miscarriage on the air. In January 1982, Stern had the second highest rated morning show in the city.|$|E
