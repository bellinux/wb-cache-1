6000|$|One {{may find}} excuses for Mr. Goble. [...] "The Rose of America" [...] would have tested the equanimity of {{a far more}} amiable man: and on Mr. Goble what Otis Pilkington had called its {{delicate}} whimsicality jarred profoundly. He had been {{brought up in the}} lower-browed school of musical comedy, where you shelved the plot after the opening number and filled {{in the rest of the}} evening by bringing on the girls in a variety of exotic costumes, with some good vaudeville specialists to get the laughs. Mr. Goble's idea of a musical piece was something embracing trained seals, acrobats, and two or three teams of skilled buck-and-wing dancers, with nothing on the stage, from a tree to a lamp-shade, which could not suddenly turn into a chorus-girl. The austere legitimateness of [...] "The Rose of America" [...] gave him <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck.</b> He loathed plot, and [...] "The Rose of America" [...] was all plot.|$|E

6000|$|The {{only reason}} why dog fights {{do not go}} on for ever is that Providence has decided that on each such {{occasion}} there shall always be among those present one Master Mind; one wizard who, whatever his shortcomings in other battles of life, is in this single particular sphere competent and dominating. At Roville-sur-Mer it was the red-haired young man. His dark companion might have turned from him in disgust: his services might not have seemed worth retaining by the haughty Scrymgeour: he might be <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> to [...] "the family"; but he did know how to stop a dog fight. From the first moment of his intervention calm began to steal over the scene. He had {{the same effect on}} the almost inextricably entwined belligerents as, in mediaeval legend, the Holy Grail, sliding down the sunbeam, used to have on battling knights. He did not look like a dove of peace, but the most captious could not have denied that he brought home the goods. There was a magic in his soothing hands, a spell in his voice: and in a shorter time than one would have believed possible dog after dog had been sorted out and calmed down; until presently all that was left of Armageddon was one solitary small Scotch terrier, thoughtfully licking a chewed leg. The rest of the combatants, once more in their right mind and wondering what all the fuss was about, had been captured and haled away in a whirl of recrimination by voluble owners.|$|E
60|$|The {{enterprise}} {{had started}} well. To begin with, {{he had found}} the ideal editor. He had met Mr. Renshaw at a down-East gathering presided over by Mrs. Oakley, and his Napoleonic eye had seen in J. Brabazon the seeds of domestic greatness. Before they parted, he had come to terms with him. Nor had the latter failed to justify his intuition. He made an admirable editor. It was not Mr. Renshaw's fault that the new paper had failed to electrify America. It was the public on whom the responsibility for the failure must be laid. They spoiled the whole thing. Certain of the faithful subscribed, it is true, and continued to subscribe, but the great heart of the public remained untouched. The great heart of the public declined to be interested in the meditations of Mr. Philpotts and the humor of Mr. B. Henderson Asher, and continued to spend its money along the bad old channels. The thing began to bore Mr. Scobell. He left the conduct of the journal more and more to Mr. Renshaw, until finally--it was just after the idea for extracting gold from sea water had struck him--he put the whole business definitely out of his mind. (His actual words were that he never wanted to see or hear of the darned thing again, inasmuch as it gave him <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck.)</b> Mr. Renshaw was given a free hand as to the editing, and all matters of finance connected with the enterprise were placed in the hands of Mr. Scobell's solicitors, who had instructions to sell the journal, if, as its owner crisply put it, they could find any chump who was enough of a darned chump to give real money for it. Up to the present the great army of chumps had fallen short of this ideal standard of darned chumphood.|$|E

She wore red lipstick and faded Levi’s. She was ahead of her time with her views on bilingualism in the classroom.

5000|$|In their 2002 [...] "It List", Entertainment Weekly {{declared}} Kavalier & Clay the year's [...] "It Script", {{publishing a}} short {{excerpt from the}} screenplay. Chabon told the publication, [...] "A {{lot of things about}} the book are really <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> adapt....The story takes place over this huge span of time. There's an 11-year gap in the middle when we don't see the characters at all. I wrote the first draft of the screenplay from memory, as if there were no novel at all and I were just remembering a story that I had heard.... Much less time passes in the movie than in the book. It's really just the period of the war." [...] While at that point, the film was in active pre-production (with Sydney Pollack attached to direct and Jude Law in talks to play Kavalier), by late 2004 Chabon had declared the film project [...] "very much dead".|$|E

5000|$|Early in Shirley's tenure, Hogan advised {{viewers to}} [...] "rejoice in her {{wonderful}} nastiness".

[...] Hogan called her [...] "the most convincing drunk" [...] in the programme for twenty years, but noted, [...] "that really doesn't make her any less annoying and her scenes are <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> to sit through." [...] Tess Lamacraft from The Sun Buzz magazine questioned Shirley's motivations in accepting Phil's infidelities.

5000|$|Moloney told {{a writer}} from MSN that Georgia would [...] "stir things up" [...] in Toadie's household. Shortly after she arrived, Georgia {{moved in with}} her cousin and his then {{pregnant}} partner, Sonya Mitchell (Eve Morey). Moloney quipped that she was another mouth to feed and the house was becoming a bit full what with the baby arriving too. Of how Georgia fits in, the actor explained [...] "It looks as though she's annoying Sonya and she's going to be a bit of <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck,</b> but then Sonya and her get on like a house on fire and it backfires on Toadie. He's stuck with someone who agrees with Sonya's hippy birthing ways. But it's lovely to have another member of the family on the street." [...] A writer for Channel 5's Neighbours website also stated that as the cousin of Toadie, Georgia already had an established bloodline coming into the show. McWhirter revealed that Georgia is a graduate nurse and described her as being [...] "bubbly", while a Soap World columnist called her [...] "vivacious". Georgia is also a country girl. Hampele thought her character was a positive person and hoped that whatever happens during her storylines, she would not change completely.|$|E
5000|$|Bosley Crowther {{writing in}} The New York Times liked it. [...] "The happily {{accidental}} conjunction of Bing Crosby and horse racing (which is Bing’s other love, besides crooning, {{as you may}} have read somewhere) {{has turned out to be}} the funniest comedy on Broadway, including all the side streets. The only noteworthy difference between reality and Sing You Sinners at the Paramount, is that in the movies Crosby’s horse wins—an unprecedented thing which may be explained by the fact that Bing undoubtedly must have had a hand in the script....Claude Binyon’s story and Wesley Ruggles’ direction are swell, and the two principal songs, “I’ve Got a Pocketful of Dreams” and “Don’t Let That Moon Get Away” are already being whistled about town. Incidentally, that’s another thing we like about Sing You Sinners: not too much singing." [...] Variety was in favor of it too. [...] "A new and interesting Bing Crosby emerges in Sing You Sinners, a likeable ne’er-do-well who believes that the secret of success lies in taking gambles. He is less the crooner, and, for added relief of tiring Crosby fans, if any, less of a delight for fluttering maidenly hearts. Instead, he’s something of <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> to a forgiving mother and two brothers. Crosby and a small but good cast combine with an excellent story and good direction for surefire box office[...] [...] [...] Being less the crooner in this effort than previously, Crosby does only one number solo, though there are four in the footage. Othere are molded for the trio...Crosby plays his part strongly but with restraint. He doesn’t hog anything from MacMurray nor moppet O’Connor." ...|$|E
