5|$|During {{this period}} of time in her efforts on behalf of the OSA agents, Christman felt {{conflicted}} in her activities, because she supported freedom of speech <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> her activities constituted censorship. The operator of Xenu.net, Andreas Heldal-Lund, saw Christman's posts on ARS and reached out to her via email on July 14, 2000. The two engaged in communication, and Heldal-Lund explained to Christman his motivation for managing the Operation Clambake site. Christman identified with Heldal-Lund's ideals of free speech, and on July 20, 2000, she announced her intention to leave Scientology in a public post to ARS. She realized she would face repercussions from the organization for her actions, and asked Heldal-Lund for help; he recommended she contact a group of protesters against Scientology called the Lisa McPherson Trust (LMT) who were based in Clearwater, Florida. The LMT was started by Robert Minton and former Scientologists to highlight the controversial death of Scientology member, Lisa McPherson.|$|E
5|$|In {{creating}} original music, Shimomura {{wanted to}} create compositions that would make players feel good while playing to accompany the action aspect of Kingdom Hearts. She played the game and looked over scripts and illustrations for inspiration. After coming up with ideas, she discussed them with director Tetsuya Nomura and the game planners. For the PlayStation 2 re-release of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, she and her team spent {{much of their time}} working on the fight music; Shimomura wanted the different fight music to reflect different emotions such as happiness and sadness. To handle the large workload for Kingdom Hearts coded, Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days and Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, Shimomura composed the most prominent themes, while the rest was created by other composers. In retrospect, Shimomura has stated that the Kingdom Hearts series combined the scenes and music well, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> very honored her music has entered into people's hearts. She has also commented that she enjoyed working on the project, despite its hardships, and is proud of the work.|$|E

The note also stated 'don't blame the guy I was with last night'. When Mandy and Adam asked the Police if they had looked into who the note was referring to, the Police said they didn't know, may never know, and that they weren't ever going to find out all the answers. Mandy reported that in hindsight, she doesn't feel Dagenham Police were investigating properly, and they wouldn't have had to look very far to find out Port was behind it, and save another family from emotional turmoil. When Mandy wished to challenge the open verdict or continue investigation, she reported that she was told that nothing more could be done, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> there was an attitude of 'it is what it is, deal with it'.|$|E

Gavin follows Phil to a small hotel. He reaches Kathy first and takes her to a small airfield, with the intent of flying away from England. Phil and Ronnie intercept them and convince Kathy to come back to Walford with them. While Phil arranges a hotel for her to stay in, she hides in The Arches, where she comes face to face with Sharon, who is stunned to find she is alive. They have an angry confrontation which leads to a physical fight, before Phil moves Kathy to a nearby hotel. Within a week, Kathy is revealed to have Gavin hidden in her bathroom, with him controlling her again. After Ian's wife Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) talks him out of suicide, Ian is shocked to see Kathy is alive and has witnessed the event. As Ian crosses the road to meet Kathy, he is hit by an oncoming car and rushed to hospital. Ian eventually regains consciousness and breaks down in happiness when he realises that Kathy is alive, but reveals he wants answers for her faking her death. As Ian is leaving hospital, Jane threatens Kathy to stay away from Walford in a bid to protect Ian. Ian demands to see Kathy and she explains to him that Gavin forced her to go on the run with him as part of an insurance scam and he had controlled her for years <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> she had no choice. Ian persuades her to go to the police and she agrees, however, she lies about why she is there when she enters the station by claiming her handbag is stolen and later tells Ian that she told them everything and they are looking for Gavin.

500|$|Helen Baxendale, then {{popularly known}} for her {{starring}} role as Dr Claire Maitland in the BBC medical drama Cardiac Arrest, became available halfway through the casting process of the pilot, and was invited to audition. Baxendale was initially reluctant to read for the role, as she believed {{that she would not}} be able to give a good comic performance. Executive producer Andy Harries persuaded her that she had already performed black comedy in Cardiac Arrest, and so would be well-suited to the part of Rachel. Producer Christine Langan described Baxendale as [...] "perfect for the idolized Rachel" [...] and her reading with Nesbitt as having [...] "unmistakable chemistry". Hermione Norris also auditioned for the role, but Baxendale was eventually cast. By the time of the third series, Baxendale's initial concerns had gone <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> comfortable acting with the comic actors.

Of the situation, Symons said [...] "Marilyn is in Nicole's face every minute. She's doing it out of love, but she doesn't realise she's becoming obsessed with the baby." [...] Nicole was still questioning whether she is making the right decision about her unborn baby's future and she argued with Marilyn. Nicole began dating a student from university, Angus McCathie (Tim Pocock), they got along well on their first dates. Marilyn was left worried about their agreement <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> [...] "distanced." [...] Symons explained, [...] "Marilyn is scared of being replaced. She's scared of losing the baby, which could happen because there isn't a legal agreement." [...] Roo Stewart (Georgie Parker) helped Nicole by convincing Marilyn to re-evaluate the situation.

Kills revealed that she left her birthplace of Bradford in England {{at the age of}} 14, in order to pursue her desire of having a better life, with a good boyfriend and life; however she only felt [...] "closer to betterness" [...] in parties, where she was exposed to recreational drugs. She started to consume them <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> better with them for [...] "a few short hours". [...] "They make you feel better, so the minute the high wears off you want more. But what's wrong with wanting more?", Kills reflected. [...] "More happiness, more power or freedom or love if you know that it's obtainable without the hard work, rejection and bullshit? [...] Sometimes it feels that reality is bad—much worse than the drug that helps you escape it for a few short hours." [...] She further explained that she wanted to create an [...] "honest video that showed both [...] realities with all the disaster, delusion, and desire." [...] The video was released on 19 February 2014 on Kills' Vevo and YouTube accounts.|$|E
500|$|... "She is enigmatic but I {{must tell}} you I never had a bad {{experience}} because of her enigma. What it was, she explained this once, is that she did this on purpose. The choice she made as an actress was, in playing the outsider in the Ewing family, she actually maintained somewhat of an outsider position with the cast as social equals. She didn't {{do a lot of}} the hanging out social activities that a lot of us did because we were together so much. So in that sense, she was maybe a few percentage points removed from the swirl that was the social center of our group. At least twice a year Larry Hagman and I would go up to Canada – fishing trips, hunting trips, things like that. Steve Kanaly was included in that group, and we would go up together, and Steve and I would take other trips together. We were a group, and Linda Gray was also a member of that group. Victoria was always slightly outside and didn't participate in those things. It was her own choice <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> it was conducive to her playing the part of Pamela. But the times we were together on the set, waiting for scenes to be shot, in the make-up room and everything, it was nothing but convivial." ...|$|E

500|$|Winslet campaigned heavily for {{the part}} of Rose DeWitt Bukater, a free-spirited socialite aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic, in James Cameron's epic romance Titanic (1997). Cameron was {{initially}} reluctant to cast her, preferring the stars Claire Danes or Gwyneth Paltrow, but Winslet pleaded with him, [...] "You don't understand! I am Rose! I don't know why you're even seeing anyone else!" [...] Her persistence led Cameron to hire her. Leonardo DiCaprio featured as her love interest, Jack. Titanic had a production budget of US$200 million, and its highly arduous principal photography was held at Rosarito Beach where {{a replica of the}} ship was created. Filming proved to be taxing for Winslet. She once nearly drowned, contracted influenza, suffered from hypothermia on being submerged in freezing water, and had bruises on her arms and knees. The work-load allowed her only four hours of sleep per day <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> drained by the experience. David Ansen, writing for Newsweek, called Titanic a [...] "big, bold, touchingly uncynical" [...] film and praised Winslet for capturing her character's [...] "stifled ardor with [...] pained delicacy". Mike Clark of USA Today considered Winslet to be the film's prime asset. Against expectations, Titanic {{went on to become the}} highest-grossing film of all time to that point, grossing over US$2 billion in box-office receipts worldwide, and established Winslet as a global star. The film won 11 Academy Awardsthe most for any filmincluding Best Picture and gained Winslet a Best Actress nomination.|$|E
500|$|According to Bowen, she was [...] "not a wolf person" [...] before penning Wolf: The Journey Home. [...] A {{language}} arts teacher at Flathead High School in northwest Montana {{and a former}} op-ed columnist for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, she stated that she read news reports about the Pleasant Valley wolf pack in the Daily Inter Lake, {{but it was the}} death of one of the Ninemile pups that spurred her to write the novel. In her words, it was [...] "one death too many" [...] from the many non-accidental deaths of the wolves, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> the [...] "story needed to be told". She spent four years studying wolves in preparation for writing the novel, particularly the lives of a pack of wolves that were part of the federal wolf relocation program and who were documented in records kept by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The pack formed in the spring of 1989 in Pleasant Valley, Montana. As in the novel, the alpha male was killed, mistaken for a dog by a rancher, {{and the rest of the}} pack was trapped, except the one pup that escaped. They were held in Kalispell until they could be transferred to Glacier Park. Using radio collars, biologists were able to track the pack members from their release to their eventual fates, as depicted in the novel. The pups born to Marta and Greatfoot were born in Spring 1990 in Ninemile Valley, an area near Missoula. When they stopped receiving a signal for Marta, authorities searched for her body for weeks until her broken radio collar was found in a creek. Mike Jimenez, then a wildlife biologist and the Wyoming Wolf Recovery Project Leader, was the man in the blue truck who tracked and monitored the pack in the novel and fed the pups after the death of Greatfoot.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{over a number}} of afternoons at the end of 2007, with each day's filming {{beginning}} with a repeat of the last section from the previous day, to help blend each scene into the next. It was filmed with a [...] "single camera mentality" [...] but with up to five cameras running to give Brown a [...] "freedom of performance away from hitting marks or favouring one particular camera position." [...] This also helped in the case of technical problems, meaning that second takes were not necessary. Brown cried when she read the script and though she did not cry during fiming, she had expected to, planning to pause the tape recorder if she did. She stated that {{the most difficult part of}} the script was the line about Jim being [...] "here, but not here" [...] because she felt that way about Bardon. Arnold admitted to [...] " [...] away the tears" [...] many times and noted that several other crew cried, and that one of the toughest things about it was that it mirrored real-life events. Brown found the episode easy to film due to the fact there were no other cast members to make mistakes, and because she [...] "knew the character backwards" [...] and [...] "exactly how she'd behave and what she'd feel and [...] her history." [...] She praised Arnold and the crew, stating that the episode was [...] "lovely" [...] to make <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> [...] "very fortunate to be given the opportunity." [...] The performance was edited in post production after being committed to tape, where usually all scenes are vision mixed, and the usual EastEnders theme tune was replaced at the end of the episode with Tony Jackson's [...] "Pretty Baby".|$|E
