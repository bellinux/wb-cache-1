40|$|Proteolytic {{maturation}} of proBMP- 4 {{is required}} to generate an <b>active</b> <b>signaling</b> molecule. We show that proBMP- 4 is cleaved by furin in a sequential manner. Cleavage at a consensus furin site adjacent to the mature ligand domain allows for subsequent cleavage at an upstream nonconsensus furin site within the prodomain. BMP- 4 synthesized from precursor in which the upstream site is noncleavable is less <b>active,</b> <b>signals</b> at a shorter range, and accumulates at lower levels than does BMP- 4 cleaved from native precursor. Conversely, BMP- 4 cleaved from precursor in which both sites are rapidly cleaved is more <b>active</b> and <b>signals</b> over a greater range.

Unlike wired LANs, nodes cannot build a complete history of the network from the fragments of feedback they obtain from the channel. This feature makes the collision detection techniques in radio networks different from cabled networks. The <b>active</b> <b>signalling</b> feature of the radio LAN standard HIPERLAN provides an efficient channel access mechanism.

40|$|CellFateScout – a {{bioinformatics}} {{tool for}} elucidating small molecule signaling pathways that drive cells {{in a specific}} direction Marcin Siatkowski 1, 2, Volkmar Liebscher 3 and Georg Fuellen 1 * Background: Small molecule effects can be represented by <b>active</b> <b>signaling</b> pathways within functional networks. Identifying these can help to design new strategies to utilize known small molecules, e. g. to trigger specific cellular transformations or to reposition known drugs. Results: We developed CellFateScout that uses the method of Latent Variables to turn differential high-throughput expression data and a functional network into a list of <b>active</b> <b>signaling</b> pathways. Applying it to Connectivity Map data, i. e., differential expression data describing small molecule effects, we then generated a Human Small Molecule Mechanisms Database. Finally, using a list of <b>active</b> <b>signaling</b> pathways as query, a similarity search can identify small molecules from the database that may trigger these pathways. We validated our approach systematically, using expression data of small molecule perturbations, yielding better predictions than popular bioinformatics tools. Conclusions: CellFateScout {{can be used to}} select small molecules for their desired effects.

50|$|An RF matrix {{is used in}} test systems, in both design {{verification}} and manufacturing test, to route high frequency signals between the device under test (DUT) and the test and measurement equipment. In addition to signal routing, the RF/Microwave Switch Matrix may also contain signal conditioning components including passive signal conditioning devices, such as attenuators, filters, and directional couplers, as well as <b>active</b> <b>signal</b> conditioning, such as amplification and frequency converters. Since the signal routing and signal conditioning needs of a test system differ from design to design, RF/Microwave Switch Matrices typically are custom designed by the test system engineer or by a hired contractor for each new test system.|$|E
50|$|The spindle {{assembly}} checkpoint (SAC) is an <b>active</b> <b>signal</b> produced by improperly attached kinetochores, which is conserved in all eukaryotes. The SAC stops the cell cycle by negatively regulating CDC20, thereby preventing the {{activation of the}} polyubiquitylation activities of anaphase promoting complex (APC). The proteins responsible for the SAC signal compose the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which includes SAC proteins, MAD2/MAD3 (mitotic arrest deficient), BUB3 (budding uninhibited by benzimidazole), and CDC20. Other proteins involved in the SAC include MAD1, BUB1, MPS1, and Aurora B. For higher eukaryotes, additional regulators of the SAC include constituents of the ROD-ZW10 complex, p31comet, MAPK, CDK1-cyclin-B, NEK2, and PLK1.|$|E

40|$|Overexpression of HER- 2 /neu {{in human}} breast carcinomas {{correlates}} with poor prognosis, although its strength as a prognostic indicator varies widely in different reports.
