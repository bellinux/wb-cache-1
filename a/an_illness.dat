40|$|Accredited Exercise Physiologists are allied health {{professionals}} {{trained in the}} delivery of exercise and lifestyle interventions for people with chronic illness including mental illness. This study aimed to investigate how Accredited Exercise Physiologists engage in the treatment of people with <b>a</b> mental <b>illness.</b> Accredited Exercise Physiologists were invited to complete an online survey via communication from Exercise and Sports Science Australia. Sixty-one Accredited Exercise Physiologists completed the online survey. The majority of AEPs agree that exercise is valuable in the treatment of people with <b>a</b> mental <b>illness.</b> General Practitioners are the most common referral source. Exercise Physiologists believe more people with <b>a</b> mental <b>illness</b> should be referred for services, however more than half agree that people with <b>a</b> mental <b>illness</b> are likely to be less adherent to an exercise intervention compared to people without <b>a</b> mental <b>illness.</b> More than half of respondents report no formal training in training in the prescription of exercise for people with <b>a</b> mental <b>illness</b> however 89 % believe additional professional development would be beneficial. Given the support for the efficacy of exercise in the treatment of people with mental illness, this group of {{health professionals}} appears to be an underutilised resource...|$|R
