5|$|Batygin and Brown {{suggested}} Planet Nine was a primordial giant planet core {{that was}} ejected from its initial orbit by <b>an</b> <b>encounter</b> <b>with</b> Jupiter during the nebular epoch of the Solar System {{and was later}} perturbed into a stable orbit by a distant encounter with a passing star or by the solar nebula. Others have proposed that it was captured {{in a similar manner}} from another star, or that it formed on a very distant circular orbit and was perturbed into its current eccentric orbit during a distant encounter with another star.|$|E
5|$|Billions {{of years}} ago, beings called the Guardians of the Universe used the green essence of willpower {{to create an}} intergalactic police force called the Green Lantern Corps. They divided the {{universe}} into 3600 sectors, with one Green Lantern per sector. One such Green Lantern, Abin Sur of Sector 2814, defeated the malevolent being Parallax and imprisoned him in the Lost Sector on the desolate planet Ryut. In the present day, Parallax escapes from his prison after becoming strengthened by <b>an</b> <b>encounter</b> <b>with</b> crash survivors on the planet, feeding on their fear to gain strength before pursuing and nearly killing Abin Sur, who escapes and crash-lands on Earth where he commands his power ring to find a worthy successor.|$|E

5|$|Cochrane {{prepared}} for <b>an</b> <b>encounter</b> <b>with</b> this Spanish vessel by painting Speedy {{to resemble a}} Danish brig then in the Mediterranean, the Clomer. He also appointed a Dane as quartermaster and found him a Danish naval officer's uniform. While cruising off Alicante on 21 December, Speedy encountered an enemy frigate, but tricked her into thinking she was a neutral vessel. Cochrane again used this false flag technique to his advantage; on 22January he was sailing with a convoy of Danish merchantmen under a Danish flag, pretending to escort them. When a 10-gun French ship and 8-gun Spanish brig approached, Cochrane hoisted British colours and attacked, capturing both of them.|$|E
5|$|De Grasse had {{notified}} {{his counterpart}} in Newport, the Comte de Barras Saint-Laurent, of his intentions and his planned arrival date. Barras sailed from Newport on 27 August with 8 ships of the line, 4 frigates, and 18 transports carrying French armaments and siege equipment. He deliberately sailed via a circuitous route {{in order to}} minimize the possibility of <b>an</b> <b>encounter</b> <b>with</b> the British, should they sail from New York in pursuit. Washington and Rochambeau, in the meantime, had crossed the Hudson on 24 August, leaving some troops behind as a ruse to delay any potential move on the part of General Clinton to mobilize assistance for Cornwallis.|$|E
5|$|During <b>an</b> <b>encounter</b> <b>with</b> Jupiter in 1992, the Ulysses {{spacecraft}} {{detected a}} stream of dust-sized particles being ejected from the Jovian system. The dust in these discrete streams travels away from Jupiter at speeds upwards of several hundred kilometres per second, has an average particle size of 10μm, and consists primarily of sodium chloride. Dust measurements by Galileo showed that these dust streams originate from Io, but exactly how these form, whether from Io's volcanic activity or material removed from the surface, is unknown.|$|E
