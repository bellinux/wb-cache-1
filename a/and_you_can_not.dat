40|$|For every {{marketer}} {{that focuses}} on the internal data their computers generate, change is passing them by. “Managers have come to rely heavily on the computer’s information <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> put into the computer data that you don’t have. Because of the plethora of inside information that the computer spits out, day in and day out, {{a very large number of}} executives spend all the time with these internal figures. The information you need the most and not just in business – is about the outside world. ” (Drucker, 1997). With this prevalent internal focus, no matter how many CRM, KM, BI systems an organisation implements and pays for, marketers are not going to dramatically improve the strategic effectiveness or competitiveness of organisations in their chosen markets. Don’t get me wrong. Customer learning is clearly important, but equally important is good marketing strategies, which come from making effective choices in light of your external environment. It is only through the careful collection, examination and evaluation of the facts, concerning your external environment, that appropriate strategic alternatives can be weighed in light of existing organizational resources and requirements. Every good manager recognises the need for systematic analysis of their marketplace, the competition and the external environment. Yet analysis is one of the more difficult roles a marketing specialist is called upon to perform. Surprisingly, most people do some form of analysis on a regular basis throughout their lives – when they buy a house, a car or go on a holiday. Every business also does some form of analysis whether it is looking at customers, product improvements, benchmarking, or cost savings. However, in light of constantly changing market dynamics, marketers need to do it better…. So what is analysis? Analysis involves a variety of scientific and non-scientific techniques to create insights or inferences from data or information. It is the multifaceted combination of processes by which collected information is systematically interpreted to create strategic findings and recommendations for actions. Analysis answers that critical “so what? ” question about the information gathered, and brings insight to bear directly on the marketer’s needs...|$|E
40|$|Topic: futuristic tractor In my work I {{focused on}} the design of heavy tractor plow in the future between 15 - 20 years. The main aim was to provide a {{solution}} that would undertake the issue of adaptation to different working conditions in which the tractor is moving. Adaptivnost was therefore my main goal. Specifically, I focused on balancing the tractor with respect to the driver (cab should ideally be in the middle between the wheels and as low as possible to reduce fluctuations cab drivers are very annoying and negatively affects driving performance on the tractor). This position is ideal for traveling, but not to work in small spaces and manipulate the front or rear aggregate when the requirements for the best visibility from the cab. Already in my sketches the main idea is evident when the tractor acts as a "compact housing", which change their length and position of the cab as required. For longer rides, such as dragging the machine back on the field, to extend the chassis cab and go down to the lowest position, thus creating an imaginary triangle (between the cabin and wheels), the lower base of the triangle is the longest and therefore the focus is what the lowest. Conversely for handling in a small space tractor chassis to "withdraw" - the smallest turning radius, while the cab driver to go and see better under the wheels, even on the front unit. As for power, and under current trends, it is considered that in the future will be the most efficient diesel-electric propulsion. Compared to existing engines will be smaller Diesel engine running at speed and deliver the ideal energy for the alternator, which converts it into electricity. energy for electric motors that are in each round. It has the advantage as an independent power to each wheel, improving acceleration, etc. As in the past, present and future, and my suggestion is having to {{deal with the fact that}} there always will be the engine, its chilling, and various other elements having a size <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> change too much. With this fact I have worked from the beginning and to seek solutions that would be consistent with my intent. Finally, I chose the principle that the cabin extends hydraulically angle about 45 'forward and change the length distribution of wheel movement is going through the rear chassis rails. Visually, that is very closely linked to functional aspects, it is a clean and easily readable morphology. The whole tractor is distinct lines, which meanders from the front grille, obtahuje cab to her pulled out of the alternator. The aim was to achieve a compact and dynamic shape of the bonnet. The front lights are designed so that their size and location of the suit while riding on public roads, but also to the need for oversizing greater exposure while working in the field. This helps to light in the cab roof and wings, which enable even the correct estimate of the size and contour of the tractor for oncoming cars. For the same reason, get out of shape fenders and turn signals, which can thus be seen from all angles. The tanks are fitted on the sides of the cab chassis with a total 280 l frame cabin has a triangular profile that corresponds with the previously mentioned strong lines on the hood and headlights on the wings. It is designed to be not only comfortable but also getting a driver and still underrated sufficient space for the driver's legs stretch during long rides...|$|E

40|$|Cue: Rearing {{livestock}} {{for meat}} and milk production, or for sale, is often recommended {{as a way}} for poor families to escape from poverty. This may be true, but profitable livestock production is not free of cost. In fact, if livestock are to be healthy and productive they need investment, investment of time, resources and money. Dominic Minyoi is a Chief Veterinary Officer working for the Zambian Ministry of Agriculture and Co-operatives. He recently spoke to Chris Kakunta about the importance of investment, and why the first priority for livestock farmers is to invest in the health of their new born animals, such as calves and lambs. Allowing a new born animal to feed on its mother?s milk is an extremely important first investment, as it helps to protect the animal against prevailing diseases. IN:		?Once a calf is born ? OUT:		?too late for anybody to intervene. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 16 ?? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dominic Minyoi with advice for livestock keepers on the importance of investing in their animals. Transcript Minyoi	Once a calf is born it must be exposed to colostrum. Colostrum is the first milk that comes from the mother. Within 24 hours of birth that calf should be made to suckle with that one. It gives it all the protection because colostrum carries all the necessary antibodies to protect the calf against the prevailing diseases that are in that area. And also apart from that, most farmers you find they don?t really let the calf suckle. So from birth the calf should be let to suckle until they are satisfied, that?s when the farmers can get the milk. We do know that they rely on this milk as well but the calf needs it more for growth. And as the calf grows up they must at least organise the pasture, even from crop residues. They can put those in the kraal, whatever stover, maize stover that is left, whatever from the groundnuts and beans that can be fed to the animals during the dry season when the feed is inadequate. And it is important {{at this point in time}} that they must de-worm at least twice per year. This is before the rains and after the rains so that when the rains have come in and the grass is mushrooming, the calves have got access to grass; they can put on weight because they won?t have a worm burden. Vaccination is very very important in certain age groups. They can do that for anthrax, they can do that for all the other preventable diseases. Kakunta	Your emphasis has been on the calf. Are you saying when you look after a calf properly, you are guaranteeing that the future animals will be healthy? Minyoi	Definitely, once you start looking after a calf very well that calf will grow into a strong adult. And that strong adult can only be strong if it is also exposed to certain interventions like vaccinations, de-worming, good housing, provision of water, all those are things that should be made available to the animals. In the village set up they can even use troughs, these dug-out canoes; put water in there. The animals will have access to water whenever they feel like drinking water. Not where as of now, they graze somewhere else, they are taken for water somewhere else, and by the time they come back to the kraal they are really thirsty. So we should make these things available to the livestock for them to be able to live within the surroundings instead of venturing out where they might contract a disease through mixing with other cattle. Kakunta	There are certain situations here in Zambia, Dr Minyoi, for instance in the southern part of the country, where we have East Coast Fever, commonly known as Corridor Disease. We are finding that the small-scale farmers? animals are dying, while in the same area the commercial farmers? animals are still healthy. What practical lessons have you learned from such a scenario? Minyoi	What it is, is that to prevent tick-borne diseases, one must dip the animals. And communal dip tanks are there, they exist, but these people are not co-operating, to be able to come together so that they can have their animals dipped. People should be able to invest a bit in livestock, so that they can buy the dip chemicals. And they can approach our officers, our officers can assist them in prescribing what kind of chemicals to buy. They should be doing that twice a month in the rainy season, and once every month in the dry season. Because if they dip regularly, then Corridor Disease will be something that they will hear about but not really their concern. Kakunta	But why do you think the farmers are so reluctant in terms of preventative measures? Does it mean there is a problem somewhere in terms of attitudes? Minyoi	I can attribute this partly to poor extension services. If the extension was good, farmers would have been taught how to look after animals, and then everybody would be taken on board. But what it is now, is that sometimes our extension is failing to reach the people. But where it is reaching some people don?t want to spend, they won?t invest in livestock. Livestock is a business just like any other business, they have to invest. And above all, they should attend to their regular requirements in as far as their health is concerned. Because these animals are just left to herdsmen, and when herdsmen come there is no request for a report. They should also keep their records so that these herdsmen are held accountable. Because what is happening, farmers don?t even know how the animals are, they are just told ?The animal is dead. ? <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> run a business like that. They must be part and parcel of that livestock-rearing group. They must be able to monitor the animals and see how they are getting on, so that they can report on time. Reporting condition on time, or reporting a situation on time gets one better results than reporting late, because when you report late it may be too late for anybody to intervene. End of track.
