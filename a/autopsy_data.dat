It remains, however, that the inability to recognize familiar faces is a rare disorder, not manifested by the majority of patients with right temporo-occipital injury.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Putrefaction of {{the brain}} is a {{challenge}} to a forensic pathologist because it may lead to considerable organ alterations and restrict documenting reliable autopsy findings. OBJECTIVES This study aims to present a new and systematic evaluation of possible benefits of post-mortem MR Neuroimaging (1. 5 Tesla, sequences: T 1 w, T 2 w) in putrefied corpses in comparison to PMCT and autopsy. METHODS A post-mortem MRI brain examination was conducted on 35 adult, putrefied corpses after performing a whole body CT scan prior to a forensic <b>autopsy.</b> Imaging <b>data</b> and <b>autopsy</b> findings were compared with regard to brain symmetry, gray and white matter junction, ventricular system, basal ganglia, cerebellum, brain stem, and possible pathological findings. RESULTS At autopsy, a reliable assessment of the anatomical brain structures was often restricted. MR imaging offered an assessment of the anatomical brain structures, even at advanced stages of putrefaction. In two cases, MR imaging revealed pathological findings that were detectable neither by CT scans nor at autopsy. CONCLUSIONS Post-mortem MR imaging of putrefied brains offers the possibility to assess brain morphology, even if the brain is liquefied. Post-mortem MR imaging {{of the brain}} should be considered if the assessment of a putrefied brain is crucial to the evaluation of a forensic autopsy case...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Verbal autopsy can be {{a useful}} tool for {{generating}} cause of death data in data-sparse regions around the world. The Symptom Pattern (SP) Method is one promising approach to analyzing verbal <b>autopsy</b> <b>data,</b> but it has not been tested rigorously with gold standard diagnostic criteria. We propose a simplified version of SP and evaluate its performance using verbal <b>autopsy</b> <b>data</b> with accompanying true cause of death. Methods We investigated specific parameters in SP's Bayesian framework that allow for its optimal performance in both assigning individual cause of death and in determining cause-specific mortality fractions. We evaluated these outcomes of the method separately for adult, child, and neonatal verbal autopsies in 500 different population constructs of verbal <b>autopsy</b> <b>data</b> to analyze its ability in various settings. Results We determined that a modified, simpler version of Symptom Pattern (termed Simplified Symptom Pattern, or SSP) performs better than the previously-developed approach. Across 500 samples of verbal autopsy testing data, SSP achieves a median cause-specific mortality fraction accuracy of 0. 710 for adults, 0. 739 for children, and 0. 751 for neonates. In individual cause of death assignment in the same testing environment, SSP achieves 45. 8 % chance-corrected concordance for adults, 51. 5 % for children, and 32. 5 % for neonates. Conclusions The Simplified Symptom Pattern Method for verbal autopsy can yield reliable and reasonably accurate results for both individual cause of death assignment and for determining cause-specific mortality fractions. The method demonstrates that verbal autopsies coupled with SSP {{can be a}} useful tool for analyzing mortality patterns and determining individual cause of death from verbal <b>autopsy</b> <b>data.</b> </p...|$|E

MethodsUnder Kilite-Awlealo Health and Demographic Surveillance System, we investigated mortality rates and causes of death in a cohort of female population from 1 st of January 2010 to 31 st of December 2012. At the baseline, 33, 688 females were involved for the prospective follow-up study. Households under the study were updated every six months by fulltime surveillance data collectors to identify vital events, including deaths. Verbal <b>Autopsy</b> (VA) <b>data</b> were collected by separate trained data collectors for all identified deaths in the surveillance site. Trained physicians assigned underlining causes of death using the 10 th edition of International Classification of Diseases (ICD).

40|$|Lack {{of birth}} and death {{registries}} in most of developing countries, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa led {{to the establishment of}} Demographic Surveillance Systems (DSS) sites which monitor large population cohorts within defined geographical areas. DSS collects longitudinal data on migration, births, deaths and their causes via verbal <b>autopsies.</b> DSS <b>data</b> provide an opportunity to monitor many health indicators including mortality trends.

This study provides an overview of approaches to assess, capture and detect seasonality peaks and patterns in mortality using the infant mortality data from the Rufiji DSS, Tanzania. Seasonality was best captured using Bayesian negative binomial models with time and cycle dependent seasonal parameters and autoregressive temporal error terms. Seasonal patterns are similar among different age groups during infancy and timing of their mortality peaks do not differ.

40|$|Background: InterVA is a {{probabilistic}} method for interpreting verbal <b>autopsy</b> (VA) <b>data.</b> It uses a priori approximations of probabilities relating to diseases and symptoms {{to calculate the}} probability of specific causes of death given reported symptoms recorded in a VA interview. The extent to which InterVA’s ability to characterise a population’s mortality composition might be sensitive to variations in these a priori probabilities was investigated. Methods: A priori InterVA probabilities were changed by 1, 2 or 3 steps on the logarithmic scale on which the original probabilities were based. These changes were made to a random selection of 25 % and 50 % of the original probabilities, giving six model variants. A random sample of 1, 000 VAs from South Africa, were used {{as a basis for}} experimentation and were processed using the original InterVA model and 20 random instances of each of the six InterVA model variants. Rank order of cause of death and cause-specific mortality fractions (CSMFs) from the original InterVA model and the mean, maximum and minimum results from the 20 randomly modified InterVA models for each of the six variants were compared. Results: CSMFs were functionally similar between the original InterVA model and the models with modified a priori probabilities such that even the CSMFs based on the InterVA model with the greatest degree of variation in the a priori probabilities would not lead to substantially different public health conclusions. The rank order of causes were also similar between all versions of InterVA...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{reassess}} {{the practical}} value of verbal <b>autopsy</b> <b>data,</b> which, {{in the absence}} of more definitive information, have been used to describe the causes of maternal mortality and to identify priorities in programmes intended to save women's lives in developing countries.
