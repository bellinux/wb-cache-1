This paper provides an uncertainty estimate for impedance measure-ments that apply a simple open/short correction in spite of using an <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>test</b> fixture. Experimental {{results show that the}} minimal uncertainty is obtained for impedance values close to the geometric mean of the short-circuit and open-circuit impedances, and that the theoretical prediction is indeed an upper limit for the actual uncertainty...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computational procedure for <b>asymmetrical</b> correlation <b>test</b> {{as the first}} step for constructing super Bayesian influence networks with an application in financial intermarket influence analysis. We start with a data set of multivariate time series without any prior knowledge about possible influences in the problem domain. With the belief on the existence of influence patterns, <b>asymmetrical</b> correlation <b>test</b> is developed to detect all possible asymmetries among all the pairs of random variables. We then use paired t-test to check the statistical significance for each detected asymmetric correlation. Furthermore, we check the possible existence of ever-changing cycles in nonlinear dynamical systems such as financial markets. This procedure results in a dynamic directed acyclic graph of the random variables, which provides a graphical basis for a super Bayesian influence network. Note that <b>asymmetrical</b> correlation <b>test</b> can quickly become complicated when the scale space of time and the expanding set of conditioning variables for each asymmetrical correlation are introduced. On the other hand, symmetrical or undirected correlations should not be ignored completely, as they may bear additional information for augmenting super Bayesian influence networks to general super influence networks...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{generating}} {{the sequence of}} tests required to reach a diagnostic conclusion with minimum average cost, which {{is also known as}} test sequencing problem, is considered. The test sequencing problem is formulated as an optimal binary AND/OR decision tree construction problem, whose solution is known to be NP-complete. The problem can be solved optimally using dynamic programming or AND/OR graph search methods (AO*, CF, and HS). However, for large systems, the associated computational effort with dynamic programming or AND/OR graph search methods is substantial, due to the rapidly increasing number of nodes in AND/OR search graph. In order to prevent the computational explosion, one-step or multistep lookahead heuristic algorithms have been developed to solve the test sequencing problem. Our approach is based on integrating concepts from the one-step lookahead heuristic algorithms and the strategies used in Huffman coding. The effectiveness of the algorithms is demonstrated on several test cases.

40|$|During the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT; 1, 200 – 800 kya), Earth’s orbitally paced ice age cycles intensified, {{lengthened}} from ∼ 40, 000 (∼ 40 ky) to ∼ 100 ky, {{and became}} distinctly <b>asymmetrical.</b> <b>Testing</b> hypotheses that implicate changing atmospheric CO 2 levels {{as a driver}} of the MPT has proven difficult with available observations. Here, we use orbitally resolved, boron isotope CO 2 data {{to show that the}} glacial to interglacial CO 2 difference increased from ∼ 43 to ∼ 75 μatm across the MPT, mainly because of lower glacial CO 2 levels. Through carbon cycle modeling, we attribute this decline primarily to the initiation of substantive dust-borne iron fertilization of the Southern Ocean during peak glacial stages. We also observe a twofold steepening of the relationship between sea level and CO 2 -related climate forcing that is suggestive of a change in the dynamics that govern ice sheet stability, such as that expected from the removal of subglacial regolith or interhemispheric ice sheet phase-locking. We argue that neither ice sheet dynamics nor CO 2 change in isolation can explain the MPT. Instead, we infer that the MPT was initiated by a change in ice sheet dynamics and that longer and deeper post-MPT ice ages were sustained by carbon cycle feedbacks related to dust fertilization of the Southern Ocean as a consequence of larger ice sheets...|$|R

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of structural}} fibre composite sandwich beams {{made up of}} glass fibre composite skins and phenolic core material was investigated under three-point short beam and <b>asymmetrical</b> beam shear <b>tests.</b> The effect of the shear span-to-depth ratio (a/D) was examined on the strength and failure behaviour of the composite sandwich beams. The results showed that with increasing a/D ratio, the failure load of the sandwich beam is decreasing. On the contrary, the coupling effect of flexural stresses increases with increasing a/D ratio. Noticeably, the fibre composite sandwich beams <b>tested</b> under <b>asymmetrical</b> beam shear exhibited higher failure load compared to beams tested under short beam shear. Analysis showed that the shear stress in the core is more dominant than flexural stress when the a/D ratio is 1 for the sandwich beams under short beam test and 1 to 3 for the sandwich beams <b>tested</b> under <b>asymmetrical</b> beams shear <b>test.</b> The proposed prediction equation which accounts for the combined effect of shear and flexural stresses due to the changing a/D ratio showed that it can reasonably estimate the failure load of structural fibre composite sandwich beams.

40|$|International audienceSteel-concrete {{composite}} beam {{is an alternative}} to reduce the construction time and material costs compared to a conventional reinforced or prestressed concrete one when aiming to reach a large span and limiting {{the height of the}} cross-section. Composite beam consisting of a concrete beam cased in a U-shaped steel beam has been recently reported in the literature. Such {{composite beam}} is cost effective if a thin-walled steel section is used, leading to some difficulties in welding shear stud connectors. Another shear connector devices have to be used. It is worth mentioning that during concrete encasement, the upper flanges of the U-section have to be linked in order to preserve the shape of the steel cross-section. It is then proposed here to use the linking element as a shear connector. This new type of shear connection is not covered in present norms of composite structures and it requires an investigation on its behavior and on force transfer mechanisms. The experimental investigation of the behavior of these shear connectors through <b>asymmetrical</b> push-out <b>tests</b> is presented in this paper. Two different cross-sections of shear connectors were considered. A finite element model has been developed in order to identify the stress behavior of shear connectors and the surrounding concrete.

We show—by means of a hypothetical system resembling a humanoid robot—that a laterally asymmetrical movement at a lower level of organization of movements can stimulate laterally asymmetrical movements that are direc- tionally consistent at consecutive higher levels. We show —by comparing two hypothetical systems,incorporating laterally symmetrical and asymmetrical movements, respectively—that the asymmetrical system outperforms the symmetrical system by optimizing space and time and that this space–time advantage increases with the increasing complexity of the task. Together, these results suggest that laterally asymmetrical movements can self-organize as a consequence of space–time optimization...|$|R

40|$|The shear {{behaviour}} {{of structural}} sandwich beams made by gluing together fibre composite sandwich panels in the flatwise {{and in the}} edgewise positions was investigated {{with a view of}} using this material for construction and building applications. The effect of the number and orientation of sandwich laminations on the shear strength and failure behaviour of glued sandwich beams is examined using an <b>asymmetrical</b> beam shear <b>test.</b> The results showed that the behaviour of the glued sandwich beams in the flatwise position is governed by the shear strength of the core while in the edgewise position by the shear strength of the skin. In the edgewise position, the skin carries almost 60 % of the load but only 20 % in the flatwise position. With increasing sandwich laminations, the glued sandwich beams in the edgewise position achieved over 200 % shear strength than beams in the flatwise position.

The building block of this innovative railway sleeper is a new generation composite sandwich structure made up of glass fibre composite skins and modified phenolic core material that has been specifically developed for civil engineering applications. Three different section configurations for railway sleepers were produced by gluing layers of fibre composite sandwich structure together in flatwise (horizontal) and in edgewise (vertical) orientations and tested under 4 -point static bending and <b>asymmetrical</b> beam shear <b>tests.</b> The effects of the orientation of sandwich lamination on the mechanical behavior of sleepers were investigated.

The sleeper section with glued sandwich structures in the edgewise position presented appropriate strength and stiffness for railway sleeper application and has high resistance to hold screw spikes. The mechanical properties of the fibre composite sleeper are far better than most of the available composite railway sleepers and are comparable with the existing timber turnout sleepers demonstrating that the new fibre composite sleeper is a viable alternative sleeper material for railway turnouts. ...|$|R

Intense trampling was created as unintended side-effect by benthic ecologists during field experiments in spring and summer 2005, when a mid-shore area of 25  ×  25  m was visited twice per month by on average five researchers for a period of 8  months. At the putatively-impacted location (I) (25  ×  25  m) and two nearby control locations (Cs) (25  ×  25  m each), three sites (4  ×  4  m) were randomly selected and at each site, three plots (50  ×  50  cm) were sampled after 18 and 40  days {{from the end of the}} disturbance. Multivariate and univariate <b>asymmetrical</b> analyses <b>tested</b> for changes in the macrofaunal assemblage, biomass of microphytobenthos and various sediment properties (grain-size, water content, NH 4 and NO 3 concentrations in the pore water) between the two control locations (Cs) and the putatively-impacted location (I). There were no detectable changes in the sediment properties and microphytobenthos biomass, but was observed. Microphytobenthos and NH 4 were correlated at I to the number of footprints, as estimated by the percentage cover of physical depressions. This indicated that trampling could have an impact at small scales, but more investigation is needed. Trampling, instead, clearly modified the abundance and population dynamics of the clam Macoma balthica (L.) and the cockle Cerastoderma edule (L.). There was a negative impact on adults of both species, probably because footsteps directly killed or buried the animals, provoking asphyxia. Conversely, trampling indirectly enhanced recruitment rate of M. balthica, while small-sized C. edule did not react to the trampling. It was likely that small animals could recover more quickly because trampling occurred during the growing season and there was a continuous supply of larvae and juveniles. In addition, trampling might have weakened negative adult-juvenile interactions between adult cockles and juvenile M. balthica, thus facilitating the recruitment. Our findings indicated that human trampling is a relevant source of disturbance for the conservation and management of mudflats. During the growing season recovery can be fast, but in the long-term it might lead towards the dominance of M. balthica to the cost of C. edule, thereby affecting ecosystem functioning...|$|R

The building block of these innovative beams is a composite sandwich structure made up of glass fibre reinforced polymer skins and modified phenolic foam core material. Four-point static bending and <b>asymmetrical</b> beam shear <b>tests</b> were conducted to evaluate the strength and stiffness of these structural beams. The effect of the number and orientation of sandwich laminations on the behaviour of the glue-laminated sandwich beams is investigated. Results showed that beams tested in the edgewise position failed with higher strength but have slightly lower bending stiffness than beams in the flatwise position. More importantly, the specimens in the edgewise position failed with greater ductility due to the progressive failure of the vertical fibre composite skins while the specimens in the flatwise position failed in a brittle manner due to compressive failure of the fibre composite skins.

The building block of these structural beams is a new generation composite sandwich structure made up of glass fibre reinforced polymer skins and high strength core material. In the experimental investigation, beams with 1, 2, 3, and 4 composite sandwich panels glued together were subjected to 4 -point static bending and <b>asymmetrical</b> beam shear <b>tests</b> in the flatwise and in the edgewise positions. The results of the flexural test showed that the glulam sandwich beams in the edgewise position failed with higher strength but have slightly lower bending stiffness than beams in the flatwise position. The results however indicated that the bending stiffness of the flatwise specimens converges to that of the edgewise specimens with increasing laminations. More importantly, the specimens in the edgewise position failed with greater ductility due to the progressive failure of the fibre composite skins while the specimens in the flatwise position failed in a brittle manner due to debonding between the skin and core. Under shear loading, the behaviour of the sandwich beams is significantly influenced by the shear strength and modulus of the fibre composite skin. It has been demonstrated that the glue-laminated sandwich beams exhibited better performance than the individual sandwich beams. The results of the study suggest the high possibility of using composite sandwich construction in the development of structural laminated beams...|$|R

A full body biomechanical model was used. Participants were instructed {{to sit in a}} comfortable self-selected position on a stool height adjusted to 100 % of their knee height and then stand and pick up an object from a table in front of them. Three matrices were constructed defining the progression of the torso, feet and hands in the sagittal plane along with a fourth expressing the location of the hands relative to the knees. Hierarchical clustering (HC) was used to identify different strategies. Trials were also classified as to whether the left (L) and right (R) extremities used a matching strategy (bilateral) or not (<b>asymmetrical).</b> Fisher’s exact <b>test</b> was used to compare this between groups. Clustering of the torso matrix dichotomised the trials in two major clusters; subjects leaning forward (LF) or not. The feet and hands matrices revealed sliding the foot backward (FB) and moving an arm forward (AF) strategies respectively. Trials not belonging in the AF cluster were submitted to the last HC of the fourth matrix exposing three additional strategies, the arm pushing through chair (PC), arm pushing through knee (PK) and arm not used (NA).

The analysis of these profiles was carried out in two stages to determine: (i) the {{relationship between}} the size distribution of the sediment on the bed and that found in the reference concentration, and (ii) the behaviour of the exponential decay scale of the C-profiles. From this analysis inferences are made about the relative roles of diffusion and convection in the upward sediment flux linked to the process of vortex shedding from the ripple crests. The Transfer function (Tr) defined to relate the bed sediment size distribution to that of the reference concentration indicates that, while finer fractions are relatively easily entrained, the suspension of some coarser fractions is caused by an additional convective effect that supplements diffusion. The evidence for this becomes pronounced above steep ripples, and the Transfer function suggests further that irregular waves increase the occurrence of coarser fractions in suspension. A functional form for Tr is suggested incorporating these principles. The exponential decay scale LS arising from the fractional C-profiles is also examined to assess the mechanisms responsible for the upward transfer of grains and a parameterisation of LS related to ripple size is suggested. The separate findings for Tr and LS present supporting evidence of diffusion affecting the finer fractions in suspension and combined diffusion+convection affecting the coarser fractions. The methodology developed allows the vertical profile of suspended median grain size to be predicted given knowledge of both the bed grain size distribution and also the flow conditions...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates applicative {{structures in}} Wolof, based on new {{data collected from}} native speakers in Saint Louis, Senegal. The dual purpose of this dissertation is to describe the applicative constructions available in Wolof and to identify their syntactic structure. Following previous work on applicatives, the description of these applicatives focuses on their object properties and the c-command configuration of the VP. The analysis falls within the Minimalist Program (Chomsky 1993, 1995, 2000). I propose multiple function heads involved in applicative formation which account for the properties in Wolof. Four types of applicatives, benefactive, dative, instrumental, and locative in Wolof. They are classified into three groups based on their object properties, selectional restrictions, and c-command configuration. The groups are benefactive applicatives, dative applicatives, and oblique applicatives (including instrumental and locative). Object properties will show that benefactive and dative applicatives are symmetrical applicatives while instrumental and locative applicative, which have been previously identified as symmetrical (Dunigan 1994), show mixed symmetrical and <b>asymmetrical</b> behaviour. C-command <b>tests</b> will show that in benefactive and dative applicatives, the applied object asymmetrically c-commands the theme but in instrumental and locative applicatives, it is the theme that asymmetrically c-commands the applied object. The analysis proposed {{is based on the}} Thematic and Raising Applicative Hypothesis from Georgala (2012). I propose a third applicative head in addition to thematic and raising Appls, which I call Oblique Appl. The notion of Downward Merge from Phillips (2003) and McGinnis (2005) is incorporated in Oblique Appl to account for instrumental and locative applicatives which fall outside the explanatory power of the Raising and Thematic Hypothesis vis-à-vis c-command and verbal adjacency. In the spirit and Marantz (1993) and Georgala (2012), I argue that all three applicative heads merge in the same position, above the lexical VP. I maintain that instrumental and locative applied objects are uniformly merged as VP-external objects contrary to Marantz who assume they can merge within the lexical VP...|$|R
