25|$|Heart murmurs are {{produced}} {{as a result}} of turbulent flow of blood strong enough to produce <b>audible</b> <b>noise.</b> They are usually heard as a whooshing sound. The term murmur only refers to a sound believed to originate within blood flow through or near the heart; rapid blood velocity is necessary to produce a murmur. It should be noted that most heart problems do not produce any murmur and most valve problems also do not produce an audible murmur.|$|E

In addition, the analysis found no evidence of a pattern in pedestrian vehicle involvement densities when only considering those accidents occurring on [...] or slower roads, or where the pedestrian was disabled. A previous study did not found an increased pedestrian vehicle involvement density for electric and hybrid vehicles with respect to their conventional counterparts which raised the question as to whether added sound is necessarily required.|$|E

500|$|The carrier-frequency pulsed {{output voltage}} of a PWM VFD causes rapid rise times in these pulses, the {{transmission}} line effects of which must be considered. Since the transmission-line impedance of the cable and motor are different, pulses tend to reflect back from the motor terminals into the cable. The resulting voltages can produce overvoltages equal to twice the DC bus voltage or up to 3.1times the rated line voltage for long cable runs, putting high stress on the cable and motor windings, and eventual insulation failure. [...] Insulation [...] standards for three-phase motors rated 230V or less adequately protect against such long-lead overvoltages. [...] On 460V or 575V systems and inverters with 3rd-generation 0.1-microsecond-rise-time IGBTs, the maximum recommended cable distance between VFD and motor is about 50m or 150feet. Solutions to overvoltages caused by long lead lengths include minimizing cable distance, lowering carrier frequency, installing dV/dt filters, using inverter-duty-rated motors (that are rated 600V to withstand pulse trains with rise time {{less than or equal}} to 0.1microsecond, of 1,600V peak magnitude), and installing LCR low-pass sine wave filters. Regarding lowering of carrier frequency, note that <b>audible</b> <b>noise</b> is noticeably increased for carrier frequencies less than about 6kHz and is most noticeable at about 3kHz. Selection of optimum PWM carrier frequency for ACdrives involves balancing noise, heat, motor insulation stress, common-mode voltage-induced motor bearing current damage, smooth motor operation, and other factors. Further harmonics attenuation can be obtained by using an LCR low-pass sine wave filter or dV/dtfilter.|$|E

2500|$|A quiet, {{friendly}} series erupted with {{controversy in}} the third and fourth Tests of the series. On the third day of the third Test, television images showed Stuart Broad standing on the ball, and fellow England pace-bowler James Anderson picking at the leather of the ball, causing South Africa to raise concerns about the condition of the ball, and the actions of the England duo. After some delay, the South African team announced that they were not making an official complaint to the International Cricket Council (ICC), who in turn confirmed that the matter was closed. In the fourth Test, after an apparent nick by Graeme Smith was taken by wicket-keeper Matt Prior, the umpire Tony Hill turned down the appeal, and third umpire Daryl Harper upheld Hill's decision on review. However, TV replays showed an <b>audible</b> <b>noise</b> as the ball passed the bat. England announced that they would lodge an official complaint with the ICC, with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) asking for the review to be reinstated. The ICC defended Harper, but said that it would launch a [...] "full and comprehensive investigation" [...] into the incident after the match.|$|E
2500|$|More {{recently}} introduced electronic starters {{use a different}} method to preheat the cathodes. They may be designed to be plug-in interchangeable with glow starters for use in standard fittings. They commonly use a purpose-designed semiconductor switch and [...] "soft start" [...] the lamp by preheating the cathodes before applying a controlled starting pulse which strikes the lamp first time without flickering; this dislodges a minimal amount of material from the cathodes during starting, giving longer lamp life than possible with the uncontrolled impulses to which the lamp is subjected in a switchstart. This is claimed to prolong lamp life {{by a factor of}} typically 3 to 4 times for a lamp frequently switched on as in domestic use, and to reduce the blackening of the ends of the lamp typical of fluorescent tubes. The circuit is typically complex, but the complexity is built into the IC. Electronic starters may be optimized for fast starting (typical start time of 0.3 seconds), or for most reliable starting even at low temperatures and with low supply voltages, with a startup time of 2–4 seconds. The faster-start units may produce <b>audible</b> <b>noise</b> during start-up.|$|E
5|$|Unpalatability, broadly understood, can {{be created}} {{in a variety of}} ways. Some insects such as the {{ladybird}} or tiger moth contain bitter-tasting chemicals, while the skunk produces a noxious odour, and the poison glands of the poison dart frog, the sting of a velvet ant or neurotoxin in a black widow spider make them dangerous or painful to attack. Tiger moths advertise their unpalatability by either producing ultrasonic noises which warn bats to avoid them, or by warning postures which expose brightly coloured body parts (see Unkenreflex), or exposing eyespots. Velvet ants (actually parasitic wasps) such as Dasymutilla occidentalis both have bright colours and produce <b>audible</b> <b>noises</b> when grabbed (via stridulation), which serve to reinforce the warning. Among mammals, predators can be dissuaded when a smaller animal is aggressive and able to defend itself, as for example in honey badgers.|$|R
5000|$|Heart murmurs (or cardiac murmurs) are <b>audible</b> <b>noises</b> {{through a}} stethoscope, {{generated}} by a turbulent flow of blood. Heart murmurs need to be distinguished from heart sounds which are primarily generated by the beating heart and the heart valves snapping open and shut. Generally, heart murmurs are classified as innocent (also called physiological or functional) or pathological (abnormal). Innocent murmurs are usually harmless, often caused by physiological conditions outside the heart, {{and the result of}} certain benign structural defects. Pathological murmurs are most often associated with heart valve problems but may also be caused by a wide array of structural heart defects.Various characteristics constitute a qualitative description of heart murmurs, including timing (systolic murmur and diastolic murmur), shape, location, radiation, intensity, pitch and quality.CAA systems typically categorize heart sounds and murmurs as Class I and Class III according to the American Heart Association: ...|$|R

2500|$|The rattle {{consists}} {{of a series of}} loosely interlocking hollow shells, each of which was at one point the scale covering the tip of the tail. In most other snakes, the tail tip, or terminal spine, is cone-shaped, hardly any thicker {{than the rest of the}} skin, and is shed along with it at each successive molt. In this case, however, the end-scale, or [...] "button", is much thicker and shaped like a bulb, with one or two annular constrictions to prevent it from falling off. Before each molt, a new button will have developed inside the last one and before the skin is shed, the tip of new button shrinks, thereby loosening the shell of the previous one. This process continues so the succession of molts produces an appendage consisting of a number of interlocking segments that make an <b>audible</b> <b>noise</b> when vibrated. Since younger specimens may shed three or four times in a year, every time adding a new segment to the rattle, the number of segments bears no relation to the age of the snake. In theory, the rattle could become very long indeed, but in practice, the older segments tend to wear out and fall off. How quickly this happens depends on the snake's environment, but end segments tend to break off after the rattle becomes about six or seven segments long; it is uncommon to find specimens with as many as a dozen segments. In captive specimens, however, as many as 29 segments have been found.|$|E

50|$|White-tailed deer {{have many}} forms of {{communication}} involving sounds, scent, body language, and marking. In addition to the aforementioned blowing {{in the presence of}} danger, all white-tailed deer are capable of producing <b>audible</b> <b>noises</b> unique to each animal. Fawns release a high-pitched squeal, known as a bleat, to call out to their mothers. This bleat deepens as the fawn grows until it becomes the grunt of the mature deer, a guttural sound that attracts the attention of any other deer in the area. A doe makes maternal grunts when searching for her bedded fawns. Bucks also grunt, at a pitch lower than that of the doe; this grunt deepens as the buck matures. In addition to grunting, both does and bucks also snort, a sound that often signals an imminent threat. Mature bucks also produce a grunt-snort-wheeze pattern, unique to each animal, that asserts its dominance, aggression, and hostility. Another way white-tailed deer communicate is through the use of their white tail. When spooked, it will raise its tail to warn the other deer in the immediate area.|$|R
