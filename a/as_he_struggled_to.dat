5|$|Morris found batting {{difficult}} {{for the first few}} weeks of the tour, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> adapt to the unfamiliar batting conditions. He reached 50 only twice in the nine innings after the Worcestershire match, totalling only 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared suddenly, he was liable to be caught. Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease.|$|E

He recovered, riding six-day races. At the Antwerp six-day, he dropped out {{on the fourth day}} with a cold. His cold worsened and he missed most of March. He abandoned Milan–San Remo {{at the foot of the}} Poggio. On 11 April, he finished seventh in Paris–Roubaix after crashing in the lead group.

5|$|Born in Livingston, West Lothian, Paul {{started playing}} {{football}} around {{the age of}} nine years playing for his local under-11 team Livingston United. Paul continued to play for Livingston United each year and when he played in under-13 this is when he {{caught the eye of}} Arsenal Scout Malcolm McGregor. Dickov joined the youth ranks of Arsenal in 1989, before being promoted to the first team in 1990. Under George Graham chances were limited for Dickov <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> break into the Arsenal team who were rich in talent with players such as Ian Wright. He helped the club win the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1994, and beforehand he {{had been a member of}} Arsenal's squad during its first season in the Premier League. Whilst at Highbury he spent several loan spells at both Luton Town and Brighton & Hove Albion. He left Arsenal in 1996 having made 26 appearances in all competitions, scoring seven goals.|$|E
5|$|On 26 June 2008, Giovinco officially {{returned}} to Juventus. Giovinco played his first Serie A match for Juventus on 24 September, against Catania, before assisting both goals for Vincenzo Iaquinta in the 2–2 draw with BATE Borisov in the Champions League on 30 September, {{his first start}} for the club. On 7 December, he scored his first goal for Juventus, a free kick against Lecce in a 2–1 win. In October 2008, he signed a contract extension, tying him to Juventus until the summer of 2013. Despite a promising start, Giovinco did not play regularly and made sporadic appearances throughout the season, both in the starting eleven and off the bench, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> fit into Claudio Ranieri's preferred 4–4–2 formation, and was often used out of position on the left wing. However, he did earn praise in the media for the Man of the match performance that he produced when he was started in Juventus's home fixture in Serie A against Bologna on 14 March 2009, in which he first set-up a goal from a corner and later scored another from a half-volley to help Juventus come from behind to win the match 4–1. He eventually finished the season with 3 goals in 27 appearances in all competitions, 2 of which came from 19 Serie A appearances.|$|E

5|$|Merson came {{in place}} of John Jensen in Arsenal's {{starting}} XI, while for Milan Zvonimir Boban replaced the suspended Simone, and Christian Panucci was chosen to stand in for Paolo Maldini. Graham deployed a 4–1–4–1 formation, with Schwarz acting as the lone defensive midfielder and Hartson positioned the furthest forward. Watched by a crowd of 23,953, Milan eased to a 2–0 win {{and in the process}} ended Arsenal's 15-match unbeaten run in Europe. The home side's first goal came minutes before half-time, when Daniele Massaro's defensive-splitting pass found Boban, who scored, despite Schwarz's attempts to hold him back by tugging his shirt. The Croatian forward nearly scored a second, but for Seaman's quick intervention. Up until then, Arsenal had briefly threatened; from a long ball in the 19th minute, Hartson managed to turn Franco Baresi, but scuffed his shot wide. Milan found it easy to contain the opposition, given Desailly and Savićević influenced the tempo of the match. The latter came close to doubling Milan's lead when he broke forward and hit a shot goalwards, only for Seaman to divert the ball round the post. In the second half, Wright thought he had equalised for Arsenal when he tapped the ball in, but the referee disallowed the goal as there was infringement in the build-up. Milan continued to attack and extended their lead soon after; from Savićević's corner, Massaro jumped higher than his marker Lee Dixon and headed the ball into the Arsenal goal. Dixon, who required treatment early in the second half, was substituted for Martin Keown right away <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> play on.|$|E

25|$|Nash's {{performance}} declined at {{the start}} of the 2015-16 season <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> recapture his scoring pace from the previous season. This was further exacerbated by muscle spasms that caused Nash to miss 22 games. Despite being involved in trade rumors, few teams seemed to be interested in Rick Nash and his $7.9 million cap hit. Nash scored a career-low 15 goals, going with 21 assists for a career-low 36 points. He then recorded two goals and two assists in New York's five-game opening round loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs.|$|E

Kelley himself lost the role by late May, with Baker moving rookie Koda Glover into the position due to Kelley's lack of durability. Kelley experienced dramatic increases in his rates of walks and home runs allowed over {{the first half of}} the season, landing on the disabled list twice (with a lower back strain in May and a right trapezius strain in June) <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> a 7.00 ERA and 4.5 home run rate per nine innings.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Tancred enlisted in the Natal Light Horse but was discharged as being unfit for active service in 1915. His marriage to Mary Chawick later that year produced two children and following a few post War matches Tancred retired from first-class cricket in 1920. It is believed that Tancred became depressed <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> live life out of the limelight that surrounded his cricketing career. His disillusionment was such that Tancred strongly advised his son Louis Jnr not {{to embark on a}} career in sport. Louis Jnr instead joined the Royal Air Force and, while working as a flight instructor, was killed aged 34 in a plane crash at the Isle of Axholme, Lincolnshire.|$|E
25|$|The {{department}} was originally named the Lord Chancellor's Office, {{with the first}} employees simply being transferred from Selborne's personal retinue to the new office. The need for the office was {{partly due to the}} Supreme Court of Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875, which significantly changed the structure of the courts and increased the Lord Chancellor's workload <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> enact the changes that the Acts required. Due to the odd nature of the Lord Chancellor's Office compared to other government departments (it was staffed almost entirely by lawyers and had an initial staff of only five) it developed slightly differently from other departments, regarding itself more as a lobbying organisation for the Judges and the Courts than a traditional government department.|$|E

The race officially started with a blast on Tornado's whistle. James May and Richard Hammond proceeded {{to the car and}} bike which were parked in York Way. Tornado left approximately 90–120seconds late due to delays in the camera crew boarding the support coach. As seen on the programme, Hammond was delayed as he changed into his biker's leathers and was delayed again <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> start the Black Shadow.

25|$|Munch {{continued}} {{to employ a}} variety of brushstroke techniques and color palettes throughout the 1880s and early 1890s, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> define his style. His idiom {{continued to}} veer between naturalistic, as seen in Portrait of Hans Jæger, and impressionistic, as in Rue Lafayette. His Inger On the Beach (1889), which caused another storm of confusion and controversy, hints at the simplified forms, heavy outlines, sharp contrasts, and emotional content of his mature style to come. He began to carefully calculate his compositions to create tension and emotion. While stylistically influenced by the Post-Impressionists, what evolved was a subject matter which was symbolist in content, depicting {{a state of mind}} rather than an external reality. In 1889, Munch presented his first one-man show of nearly all his works to date. The recognition it received led to a two-year state scholarship to study in Paris under French painter Léon Bonnat.|$|E
25|$|From 1814, Keats had two bequests, held {{in trust}} for him until his 21st birthday: £800 willed by his {{grandfather}} John Jennings (about £50,000 in today's money) and {{a portion of his}} mother's legacy, £8000 (about £500,000 today), to be equally divided between her living children. It seems he was not told of either, since he never applied for any of the money. Historically, blame has often been laid on Abbey as legal guardian, but he may also have been unaware. William Walton, solicitor for Keats's mother and grandmother, definitely did know and had a duty of care to relay the information to Keats. It seems he did not. The money would have made a critical difference to the poet's expectations. Money was always a great concern and difficulty for him, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> stay out of debt and make his way in the world independently.|$|E

25|$|Beneath the lunettes are {{the four}} panels {{of the upper}} {{register}}. The two outer panels of the middle register show the Annunciation to Mary, with the Archangel Gabriel {{on the left and}} the Virgin Mary on the right. Both are dressed in white robes, and occupy what appear to be the opposite ends of the same room. Gabriel and Mary's panels are separated by two much narrower images showing unoccupied domestic interior scenes. The back wall in the left-hand image has a window opening onto a view of street and city square, while that in the right-hand image has a niche. Some art historians have attempted to associate the street with an actual location in Ghent, but it is generally accepted that it is not modeled on any specific place. The sparseness of these narrow panels seem anomalous in the overall context of the altarpiece; a number of art historians have suggested that they were compromises worked out by Jan <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> accommodate his design within the original framework set out by Hubert.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the Holocaust Teichtal changed his {{position}} on Israel <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> make meaning out of what was happening around him. His carefully constructed arguments are outlined in his book Eim Habanim Semeichah penned during his wanderings in hiding from his Nazi oppressors and their collaborators. In that work, first published in 1943, he makes a case for the rebuilding of the land of Israel bringing about the ultimate redemption. In this respect his work had a precursor in the works of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook. His original view had been that of the majority in the Hungarian Orthodox Jewish world at the time, which discouraged an active movement for a return of Jews to Israel. The prevalent view at that time was that God would bring about a return without the need of human mechanizations. The Holocaust caused him to re-think this approach, and he therefore {{came to the conclusion that}} the reason that the Jewish people had not been redeemed, was because they had not returned to their homeland, the land of Israel, to resettle and rebuild it to its former glory.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1850 {{there is}} no record of Wagner expressing any {{particular}} antisemitic sentiment. However, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> develop his career he began to resent the success of Jewish composers such as Felix Mendelssohn and Giacomo Meyerbeer and blamed them for his lack of success, particularly after his stay in Paris in 1840–41 when he was impoverished and reduced to music copy-editing. Ironically, at the same time Wagner did have considerable contact with Meyerbeer, who loaned him money, and used his influence to arrange for the premiere of Rienzi, Wagner's first successful opera, in Dresden in 1842; Meyerbeer later expressed hurt and bewilderment over Wagner's written abuse of him, his works, and his faith. Wagner's first and most controversial essay on the subject was Das Judenthum in der Musik ('Jewishness in Music'), originally published under the pen-name K. Freigedank (K. Freethought) in 1850 in the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik. In a previous issue Theodor Uhlig had attacked the success in Paris of Meyerbeer's Le prophète, and Wagner's essay expanded this to an attack on supposed 'Jewishness' in all German art. The essay purported to explain popular dislike of Jewish composers, in particular Mendelssohn and Meyerbeer, who is not mentioned by name but is clearly a target. Wagner wrote that the German people were repelled by Jews due to their 'alien' appearance and behaviour: 'with all our speaking and writing in favour of the Jews' emancipation, we always felt instinctively repelled by any actual, operative contact with them.' He argued that Jewish musicians were only capable of producing music that was shallow and artificial, because they had no connection to the genuine spirit of the German people.|$|E
