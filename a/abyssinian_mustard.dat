50|$|Brassica carinata (Ethiopian rape, Ethiopian mustard, <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>mustard)</b> is {{a member}} of the Triangle of U species (U, 1935) in the agriculturally {{significant}} Brassica genus. It has 34 chromosomes with genome composition BBCC, and is thought to result from an ancestral hybridisation event between Brassica nigra (genome composition BB) and Brassica oleracea (genome composition CC) (Prakash and Hinata, 1980). Although B. carinata is cultivated as an oilseed crop in Ethiopia (Alemayehu and Becker, 2004), it has generally high levels of undesirable glucosinolates and erucic acid (Getinet et al. 1997), making it a poor choice for general cultivation as an oilseed crop in comparison to the closely related Brassica napus (Rapeseed).|$|E
40|$|Background Arsenic {{contamination}} {{is widespread}} {{throughout the world}} and this toxic metalloid is known to cause cancers of organs such as liver, kidney, skin, and lung in human. In spite of a recent surge in arsenic related studies, we are still far from a comprehensive understanding of arsenic uptake, detoxification, and sequestration in plants. Crambe abyssinica, commonly known as 2 ̆ 7 <b>abyssinian</b> <b>mustard</b> 2 ̆ 7, is a non-food, high biomass oil seed crop that is naturally tolerant to heavy metals. Moreover, it accumulates {{significantly higher levels of}} arsenic as compared to other species of the Brassicaceae family. Thus, C. abyssinica has great potential to be utilized as an ideal inedible crop for phytoremediation of heavy metals and metalloids. However, the mechanism of arsenic metabolism in higher plants, including C. abyssinica, remains elusive. Results To identify the differentially expressed transcripts and the pathways involved in arsenic metabolism and detoxification, C. abyssinica plants were subjected to arsenate stress and a PCR-Select Suppression Subtraction Hybridization (SSH) approach was employed. A total of 105 differentially expressed subtracted cDNAs were sequenced which were found to represent 38 genes. Those genes encode proteins functioning as antioxidants, metal transporters, reductases, enzymes involved in the protein degradation pathway, and several novel uncharacterized proteins. The transcripts corresponding to the subtracted cDNAs showed strong upregulation by arsenate stress as confirmed by the semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Conclusions Our study revealed novel insights into the plant defense mechanisms and the regulation of genes and gene networks in response to arsenate toxicity. The differential expression of transcripts encoding glutathione-S-transferases, antioxidants, sulfur metabolism, heat-shock proteins, metal transporters, and enzymes in the ubiquitination pathway of protein degradation as well as several unknown novel proteins serve as molecular evidence for the physiological responses to arsenate stress in plants. Additionally, many of these cDNA clones showing strong upregulation due to arsenate stress could be used as valuable markers. Further characterization of these differentially expressed genes would be useful to develop novel strategies for efficient phytoremediation as well as for engineering arsenic tolerant crops with reduced arsenic translocation to the edible parts of plants...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} my {{research}} was on the secondary metabolites produced by crucifer plants under stress and their biological activity against fungi. Both cultivated and wild plants were investigated to isolate phytoalexins and phytoanticipins, and determine their metabolite profiles. The first chapter of this thesis describes cruciferous plants and their most important pathogenic fungi. These plants are divided into three groups: oilseeds, vegetables and wild species. The metabolites isolated from these plants and their biosynthetic studies are reviewed. In addition economically important necrotrophic fungi such as Leptosphaeria maculans, Alternaria brassicae, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Rhizoctonia solani are also reviewed along with their phytotoxins. The second chapter of this thesis describes the detection, isolation, structure determination, syntheses of stress metabolites and biological activity of these metabolites against L. maculans, S. sclerotiorum and R. solani. The investigation of cauliflower led to the isolation of seven phytoalexins: 1 -methoxybrassitin (55), spirobrassinin (71), isalexin (64), brassicanal C (60), caulilexins A (106), B (107), and C (105). The phytoalexins caulilexins A (106), B (107) and C (105) were reported for the first time. Caulilexin A (106), having a disulfide bridge, showed the highest activity against S. sclerotiorum and R. solani among the known phytoalexins. Similarly four phytoalexins: 1 -methoxybrassitin, brussalexins A (121), B (117) and C (118) along with four metabolites: ascorbigen (51), diindolylmethane (50), 1 -methoxy- 3, 3 ’-diindolylmethane (119) and di-(1 -methoxy- 3 -indolyl) methane (120) were isolated from Brussels sprouts. The phytoalexins brussalexins A (121), B (117) and C (118) are new metabolites. Brussalexin A (121) is the only cruciferous phytoalexins having an allyl thiolcarbamate functional group. The metabolite 1 -methoxy- 3, 3 ’-diindolylmethane (119) is reported for the first time. The investigation of brown mustard for polar metabolites led to the isolation of indole- 3 -acetonitrile (76) and spirobrassinin (71) along with isorhamnetin- 3, 7 -diglucoside (134). Investigation of wild species such as Asian mustard, sand rocket, wallrocket, hedge mustard and <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>mustard</b> for production of stress metabolites led to the isolation of indole- 3 -acetonitrile (76), arvelexin (84), 1, 4 -dimethoxyindole- 3 -acetonitrile (137), rapalexins A (138) and B (142), methyl- 1 -methoxyindole- 3 -carboxylate (59) and metabolites bis(4 -isothiocyanotobutyl) -disulfide (139), 5 -(3 -isothiocyanato-propylsulfanyl) -pentylisothiocyanate (136) and 3 -(methylsulfinyl) -propylisothiocyanate (135). Two metabolites were also isolated from Brussels sprouts and brown mustard; however, these structures are not yet determined. The metabolites 1, 4 -dimethoxyindole- 3 -acetonitrile (137) and 5 -(3 -isothiocyanato-propylsulfanyl) -pentylisothiocyanate (136) are reported for the first time...|$|E
