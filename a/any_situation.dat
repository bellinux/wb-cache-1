5|$|I am vexed and {{surprised}} at your not thinking {{the situation of}} Maria sufficiently important, and can only account for this want of – shall I say it? delicacy of feeling, by recollecting {{that you are a}} man – For my part I cannot suppose <b>any</b> <b>situation</b> more distressing than for a woman of sensibility with an improving mind to be bound, to such a man as I have described, for life – obliged to renounce all the humanizing affections, and to avoid cultivating her taste lest her perception of grace, and refinement of sentiment should sharpen to agony the pangs of disappointment.|$|E
5|$|The humanists {{believed}} {{that it is important}} to transcend to the afterlife with a perfect mind and body, which could be attained with education. The purpose of humanism was to create a universal man whose person combined intellectual and physical excellence and who was capable of functioning honorably in virtually <b>any</b> <b>situation.</b> This ideology was referred to as the uomo universale, an ancient Greco-Roman ideal. Education during the Renaissance was mainly composed of ancient literature and history as it was thought that the classics provided moral instruction and an intensive understanding of human behavior.|$|E

Capcom added detail to the zombie enemies unprecedented in the series, such as making their jaws move and eyes twitch. Claire {{was given a}} tougher appearance in Code: Veronica than in Resident Evil 2, the reason being her experiences in Resident Evil 2 built her toughness and confidence to handle <b>any</b> <b>situation.</b> This characterization is emphasized by her ability to dual wield sub-machine guns, and also by the opening cinematic which features her in a John Woo-inspired action scene. Mikami described Code: Veronica as 50-60% of his perfect vision for Resident Evil in February 2001, and he cited that future Resident Evil projects may make up the other half.|$|E

Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in <b>any</b> <b>situation.</b> They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises. Pomeranians are intelligent, respond well to training, and can be very successful in getting what they want from their owners. They are extroverted and enjoy being the center of attention, {{but they can be}}come dominant if not well trained and socialized. The use of toys can be an effective tool in training Pomeranians to spend time alone.|$|E

Although gentle and likeable, mutable subjects seem to have more than their fair share of problems and can be selfish and ruthless when they feel threatened.

Subjects lacking mutable signs may be unable to adapt to any kind of change and be particularly unhappy when faced with uncertainty. They need lots of notice before they will commit themselves to anything, and lack flexibility and adaptability. They may also hold onto rigid and unchanging views. Planets in the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th houses will help to compensate for this lack, and water signs in the chart will make up for the lack of intuition.|$|E
