40|$|AbstractDNAL 1 <b>and</b> <b>MAP</b> 4 {{are both}} microtubule-associated {{proteins}}. These proteins {{were identified as}} HIV- 1 dependency factors in a screen with wild-type HIV- 1. In this study we demonstrate that knockdown using DNAL 1 <b>and</b> <b>MAP</b> 4 siRNAs <b>and</b> shRNAs inhibits HIV- 1 infection regardless of envelope. Using a fusion assay, we show that DNAL 1 <b>and</b> <b>MAP</b> 4 do not impact fusion. By assaying for late reverse transcripts and 2 -LTR circles, we show that DNAL 1 <b>and</b> <b>MAP</b> 4 inhibit both by approximately 50 %. These results demonstrate that DNAL 1 <b>and</b> <b>MAP</b> 4 impact reverse transcription but not nuclear translocation. DNAL 1 <b>and</b> <b>MAP</b> 4 knockdown cells do not display cytoskeletal defects. Together these experiments indicate that DNAL 1 <b>and</b> <b>MAP</b> 4 may exert their functions in the HIV life cycle at reverse transcription, prior to nuclear translocation...|$|R

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that {{tracking}} <b>and</b> <b>mapping</b> (TAM) is used instead of using localization <b>and</b> <b>mapping.</b> TAM was first used in Parallel Tracking <b>and</b> <b>Mapping</b> (PTAM) [15] because localization <b>and</b> <b>mapping</b> are not simultaneously performed in a traditional way. Tracking is performed in every frame with one thread whereas mapping is performed at a certain timing with another thread. After PTAM was proposed, most of vSLAM algorithms follows the framework of TAM. Therefore, TAM is used in this paper.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{present an}} {{approach}} and prototype implementation to initialization-free real-time tracking <b>and</b> <b>mapping</b> that supports {{any type of}} camera motion in 3 D environments, that is, parallax-inducing as well as rotation-only motions. Our approach effectively behaves like a keyframe-based Simultaneous Localization <b>and</b> <b>Mapping</b> system or a panorama tracking <b>and</b> <b>mapping</b> system, depending on the camera movement. It seamlessly switches between the two modes and is thus able to track <b>and</b> <b>map</b> through arbitrary sequences of parallax-inducing and rotation-only camera movements. The system integrates both model-based and model-free tracking, automatically choosing between the two depending on the situation, and subsequently uses the “Geometric Robust Information Criterion ” {{to decide whether the}} current camera motion can best be represented as a parallax-inducing motion or a rotation-only motion. It continues to collect <b>and</b> <b>map</b> data after tracking failure by creating separate tracks which are later merged if they are found to overlap. This is in contrast to most existing tracking <b>and</b> <b>mapping</b> systems, which suspend tracking <b>and</b> <b>mapping</b> <b>and</b> thus discard valuable data until relocalization with respect to the initial map is successful. We tested our prototype implementation on a variety of video sequences, successfully tracking through different camera motions and fully automatically building combinations of panoramas and 3 D structure.

40|$|Ecosystems are {{increasingly}} {{being used as a}} framework for integrated resource management, protected areas planning and environmental / cumulative effects assessment. Ecosystem mapping is well suited to assisting sustainable resource management activities. While ecosystem classification <b>and</b> <b>mapping</b> is acknowledged as an important activity, Yukon does not currently have an accepted or standardised system of ecological classification <b>and</b> <b>mapping.</b> There is currently no single “ecosystem classification <b>and</b> <b>mapping</b> framework ” to describe the range of physiographic and biological diversity within Yukon at scales that are meaningful for the purposes of land management.
