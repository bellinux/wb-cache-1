40|$|AbstractGap junctions, {{specialised}} membrane {{structures that}} mediate cell-to-cell communication {{in almost all}} tissues, are composed of channel-forming integral membrane proteins termed connexins. The activity of these intercellular channels is closely regulated, particularly by intramolecular modifications as phosphorylations of proteins by protein kinases, which appear to regulate the gap junction at several levels, including <b>assembly</b> <b>of</b> <b>channels</b> in the plasma membrane, connexin turnover as well as directly affecting the opening and closure (“gating”) of channels. The regulation of membrane channels by protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes commonly requires {{the formation of a}} multiprotein complex, where pore-forming subunits bind to auxiliary proteins (e. g. scaffolding proteins, catalytic and regulatory subunits), that play essential roles in channel localisation and activity, linking signalling enzymes, substrates and effectors into a structure frequently anchored to the cytoskeleton.

The core component is the rotating filter element {{which consists of}} a multitude of axially oriented channels which rotate as a whole around a common axis. Particles in the gas flowing in a laminar fashion through the channels are centrifuged towards the outer collecting walls of each individual channel while the purified gas leaves the channels at the exit. Solutions in closed form are presented for the probability that particles of given diameter are separated from the gas. Particle trajectories are governed by centrifugal forces and Stokes drag forces including Cunningham's correction. Solutions are given for channels of the following cross-sectional shapes: concentric rings, circles, triangles and sinusoids.

However, these domains are generally flexible, making them difficult or unsuitable targets for obtaining high-resolution X-ray and NMR structural information. In this study we show that the highly sensitive method of synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) spectroscopy {{can be used as}} a powerful tool to investigate the structure of the extramembranous C-terminal domain (CTD) of the prokaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV) from Bacillus halodurans, NaChBac. Sequence analyses predict its CTD will consist of an unordered region followed by an α-helix, which has a propensity to form a multimeric coiled-coil motif, and which could form an association domain in the homotetrameric NaChBac channel. By creating a number of shortened constructs we have shown experimentally that the CTD does indeed contain a stretch of ∼ 20 α-helical residues preceded by a nonhelical region adjacent to the final transmembrane segment and that the efficiency of <b>assembly</b> <b>of</b> <b>channels</b> in the membrane progressively decreases as the CTD residues are removed.

50|$|Editing in some striatal and {{cortical}} neurons is {{more likely}} to be subject to excitotoxicity, thought to be due to less than 100% editing of these particular neurons. Editing also has several other function effects. Editing alters the maturation and <b>assembly</b> <b>of</b> the <b>channel,</b> with the unedited form having a tendency to tetramerize and then is transported to the synapse. However, the edited version is assembled as a monomer and resides mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum. The arginine residue in the pore loop of GluR-2 receptor is thought to belong to a retention signal for the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, editing - since it occurs at 100% frequency - inhibits the availability <b>of</b> the <b>channel</b> at the synapse.

40|$|By {{analogy to}} other cation channel {{subunits}} with six transmembrane-spanning domains, the TRPC channels {{are believed to}} assemble into homo- or heterotetrameric complexes. These complexes have been verified by biochemical or functional methods related to cell destruction or restricted to surface proteins. Thus dynamic analyses in living cells or analyses <b>of</b> the <b>assembly</b> <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> subunits in subcellular compartiments were not possible. More recently, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) - a measure for the close proximity of fluorescent molecules - has become instrumental in following protein assembly in living cells. This work demonstrates further possibilities and verification procedures of the FRET-technology to test the <b>assembly</b> <b>of</b> ion <b>channel</b> subunits. Temporally and spatially resolved FRET imaging demonstrates an early <b>assembly</b> <b>of</b> TRPC subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Due to the mobilitly of TRPC 6 -channels within the plasma membrane proven via fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), TRPC-subunit interaction in subcellular compartiments was analysed via confocal FRET imaging based on a spectral deconvolution method. It verifies FRET signals over the plasma membrane at high spatial resolution. The non-destructive proof <b>of</b> subunit <b>assembly</b> presented in this work allows to study the dynamic of protein-interaction even in subcellular compartiments. Quantitative analysis of digital video imaging demonstrates that FRET between TRPC subunits is only weakly concentration-dependent. Thus FRET {{can be considered as}} specific proof of interaction between TRPC subunits. Moreover, the introduction of a competition-FRET assay allows to test the ability of wild-type TRPC subunits to recruit fluorescent TRPC subunits into separate channel complexes and offers the possibility to test the interaction between more than two different proteins as well as the affinity between different fluorescent proteins. Finally, correlation between the efficiency of energy transfer and the molar ratio of the FRET donor to the acceptor was exploited to verify the tetrameric stoichiometry of TRPC complexes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNative ion {{channels}} are precisely tuned to their physiological role in neuronal signaling. This tuning frequently involves the controlled <b>assembly</b> <b>of</b> heteromeric <b>channels</b> comprising multiple types of subunits. Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) <b>channels</b> <b>of</b> olfactory neurons are tetramers and require {{three types of}} subunits, CNGA 2, CNGA 4, and CNGB 1 b, to exhibit properties necessary for olfactory transduction.

Two nucleated cell lines, Molt 4 and U 937, derived from human T lymphocytes and histiocytes, respectively, were employed as targets. The antibody-sensitized cells were used to develop the titration curves, measuring cell death as a function of limiting quantities of human C 6 or C 5, 6 complex in the presence of an excess of other complement components. The cytolysis curves generated in both experiments were sigmoidal, in sharp contrast to the monotonic curves observed in lysis of erythrocytes treated similarly. The sigmoidal curves of cytolysis indicate a cooperative action of several molecules of C 6 or acid-activated C 5, 6 complex, C(56) a. In contrast to the multi-hit characteristics of cytolysis, dose-response measurements of the release of 86 Rb indicated that only one effective molecule of C 6 per cell is required for <b>assembly</b> <b>of</b> a 86 Rb-releasing channel.
