500|$|... "Crippled Summer" [...] {{served as}} a parody of Intervention, the A Network {{documentary}} series about people struggling with various addictions. Throughout the episode, information about Towelie's drug addiction is presented on completely black screens with white letters. This device is used frequently in Intervention. The interviews with Towelie's friends and footage of their pleas to get help are also characteristic of the reality series. During one of Towelie's interviews, he quotes [...] "feels like I'm walking on sunshine" [...] after huffing <b>air</b> <b>duster</b> cans. Both the quote and his actions are from Season 5, episode 9 of the TV reality series Intervention where they interview [...] "Allison". Many of the campers at Lake Tardicaca are parodies of characters from the cartoon series Looney Tunes. Nathan and Mimsy, in particular, are strongly influenced by Rocky and Mugsy, with Nathan taking {{on the role of}} the diminutive mastermind (like Rocky) who is constantly thwarted by his large but dim-witted accomplice (like Mugsy). Other characters from the summer camp in the episode resemble cartoon characters such as Elmer Fudd, Pete Puma, Droopy, Porky Pig, Taz, Foghorn Leghorn, and Beaky Buzzard.|$|E
5000|$|Overheating {{has been}} reduced by using {{compressed}} <b>air</b> <b>duster</b> spray. Spraying the keyboard, the Microprocessor Thermal-Cooling Assembly located under the [...] "I" [...] - [...] "backspace" [...] keys, rear air vent/exhaust, bottom air intake, and side air vent (all located {{on the right side}} of affected systems)have been effective in reducing the running temperature from a normal operating temperature of 77-87 °C to 45-55 °C under average load. Note: Be sure that the system is powered off and unplugged from AC with its battery removed before using the spray. With the AC and battery removed, press the power button to drain any remaining charge from the capacitors. Never apply compressed <b>air</b> <b>duster</b> spray to a powered-on electronic device.|$|E
5000|$|True [...] "air dusters" [...] using {{ordinary}} air {{are also}} available in the market. These typically have much shorter run times than a chemical duster, but are readily refillable. Both hand pump and electric compressor models have been marketed. The maximum pressure for an aerosol can is typically 10 bar (145 psi) at 20 C (68 F). Therefore, a fully compressed <b>air</b> <b>duster</b> will exhaust air about 10 times the can volume. Recently electronic versions which only use air have become viable alternatives that are preferred by many large corporations {{due to the fact}} that they contain no hazardous chemicals, are safe for the environment, do not freeze and they cannot be abused by addicts looking to get high. The leading plug-in alternatives are made by DataVac and Airrow and the leading cordless alternative is made by Canless Air System.|$|E

5000|$|Aviation enthusiast William Diffendahl carved the airpark out {{of local}} {{farmland}} {{in the late}} 1930s and early 1940s and it was used by aviation enthusiasts from the working communities around the Baltimore Glenn L. Martin Company plant that built the Martin M-130 flying boat, the Martin B-26 Marauder bomber and other aircraft in the 1940s. A 1947 Maryland Airport Directory listed the airport as having two intersecting grass runways: a north-south strip 2,200 feet in length and an east-west strip 1,800 feet in length. Buildings on the airport (which was {{owned and operated by}} Isabelle Diffendahl) included an administration building, a 44-foot by 60-foot hangar as well as eight t-hangars. The early years were very good to the airport with more than 200 pilots calling the field their homeport. These pilots included crop <b>dusters,</b> <b>air</b> traffic reporters, traveling salesmen, daredevils and more.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the {{aerodynamic}} force acting upon a soccer ball spun in a wind-tunnel test. In particular, we prepared two types of spinning soccer balls (air and motor types), measured the aerodynamic force on each, and examined the validity of the measurement method. In the case of the air-type spinning ball, the ball was made to spin by applying compressed air from an air compressor via an <b>air</b> <b>duster.</b> In the case of the motor-type spinning ball, a motor was placed at the middle inside the ball, and the ball was then automatically spun. First, both the air- and motor-type spinning balls demonstrated very strong spin-parameter (Sp) dependence with respect to drag during spinning. In addition, the side-force coefficient showed signs of linear increase as Sp increased in the motor-type spinning ball, whereas it increased along a slight curve in the air-type spinning ball. In particular, a negative Magnus effect was observed in the motor-type spinning ball when the Reynolds number was approximately 2. 0 × 105 and Sp was approximately 0. 14 (- 0. 007) and when the Reynolds number was approximately 2. 2 × 105 and Sp was approximately 0. 13 (- 0. 005) ...|$|E
