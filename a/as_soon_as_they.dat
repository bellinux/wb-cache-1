5|$|Surcouf {{arrived at}} Île de France in June, {{defeating}} the British blockade and capturing several ships on the journey. During the subsequent campaign, {{which was to}} be his last, Surcouf captured 16 British ships, partly because British ships tended strike their colours <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> realised their opponent was Surcouf.|$|E
5|$|The {{action was}} {{illuminated}} in brief, blinding flashes by Jap searchlights which were shot out <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were turned on, by muzzle flashes from big guns, by fantastic streams of tracers, and by huge orange-colored explosions as two Jap destroyers {{and one of}} our destroyers blew up... From the beach it resembled a door to hell opening and closing... over and over.|$|E

5|$|The {{outcome of}} the battle changed the {{perception}} of the rebel movement in Mexico. Before Madero's victory many believed that the rebel forces would scatter <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were confronted by federal troops. The fall of Juárez proved that notion wrong and revealed the real strength of the rebel forces.|$|E
5|$|At 11:35, Kinkaid {{decided to}} {{withdraw}} Enterprise and her screening ships from battle, since Hornet {{was out of}} action, Enterprise was heavily damaged, and surmising, correctly, that the Japanese had one or two undamaged carriers in the area. Leaving Hornet behind, Kinkaid directed the carrier and her task force to retreat <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were able. Between 11:39 and 13:22, Enterprise recovered 57 of the 73 airborne U.S. aircraft as she retreated. The remaining U.S. aircraft ditched in the ocean, and their aircrews were rescued by escorting warships.|$|E

Red Bull pulled in both Webber and David Coulthard for their pit stops <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could when the safety car came on track, due to Nelson Piquet, Jr. crashing, giving them both great track position. This led to Webber running in 2nd place before a gearbox issue put {{him out of the}} race on lap 29.|$|E

5|$|If Sheshi {{is to be}} {{equated with}} Salitis, then the seals of Sheshi {{discovered}} in Nubia suggest that the Hyksos allied themselves with the Nubians against the native Egyptian 13th Dynasty <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> arrived in the Nile Delta, an event which Grimal places c. 1720 BC. Grimal envisions Sheshi's kingdom as comprising the entire Nile Delta and the Nile valley north of Gebelein. According to Manetho as reported by Josephus in Against Apion, Salitis reigned from Memphis, and fortified the existing town of Avaris, which was to become the Hyksos' seat of power.|$|E
5|$|King {{argues that}} enslaved {{children}} {{did not have the}} opportunities for childhood and thus, did not have childhoods. Slave children instead worked <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could, were often separated from caregivers and family, and were subject to punishment of many sorts, sometimes no different than those levied on adults. The children's trauma was compared to that of war—enduring abuses, sexual exploitation, inability to protect themselves—and they aged prematurely through these experiences.|$|E

Elaine is ravenous, but refuses to eat concession stand food at the movie theater. After missing Tatiana's call, George decides he's {{no longer in the}} mood for the film, Elaine wants to leave and get a hamburger, and Jerry decides that {{he might as well have}} dinner with his uncle. <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> leave, the maître d' calls their party.|$|E

5|$|Some viruses {{store their}} entire genomes {{in the form}} of RNA, and contain no DNA at all. Because they use RNA to store genes, their {{cellular}} hosts may synthesize their proteins <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are infected and without the delay in waiting for transcription. On the other hand, RNA retroviruses, such as HIV, require the reverse transcription of their genome from RNA into DNA before their proteins can be synthesized. RNA-mediated epigenetic inheritance has also been observed in plants and very rarely in animals.|$|E
5|$|The massive {{influx of}} prospectors drove the {{formation}} of boom towns along the routes of the stampede, with Dawson City in the Klondike the largest. The new towns were crowded, often chaotic and many disappeared just <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> came. Most stampeders were men but women also travelled to the region, typically as {{the wife of a}} prospector. Some women entertained in gambling and dance halls built by business men and women who were encouraged by the lavish spending of successful miners.|$|E
5|$|The quick pace {{of change}} meant that many ships were {{obsolete}} <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were finished, and that naval tactics were {{in a state of}} flux. Many ironclads were built {{to make use of the}} ram or the torpedo, which a number of naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat. There is no clear end to the ironclad period, but towards the end of the 1890s the term ironclad dropped out of use. New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers.|$|E

5|$|After {{a period}} of leave, the {{battalion}} began to reform on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland during February 1944 {{and for the next}} eight months they undertook a number of exercises and training periods as they prepared for the next stage of the war. During this time, the battalion's authorised strength was reduced to 803 men of all ranks, as the 3rd Division was converted to the Jungle divisional establishment. On 20 July 1944, the 61st Battalion embarked upon HMAT Katoomba in Cairns and proceeded overseas again. They arrived at Madang in New Guinea four days later. As it was considered that there were still isolated pockets of Japanese in the area, the battalion began patrolling operations almost <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> had landed.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} {{they are}} short of money, {{a group of}} four robbers decide to execute a bank heist. The four create a plan and hire an unwitting chauffeur to drive them to their location. <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> reach an isolated road, the robbers force the chauffeur out of the car, gag him, and throw him into a ditch. The robbers then drive {{the car to the}} bank. After entering, they kill a security guard and use explosives to force the bank vault open. The thieves steal as much money as possible and make a quick retreat to their car. Back in the park, a young couple on a walk discover the unconscious body of the chauffeur, and the man calls the police.|$|E
5|$|Among the American {{units that}} {{reinforced}} the Pusan Perimeter <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could arrive were the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, the 7th Infantry Division, and the 25th Infantry Divisions, {{along with other}} units of the U.S. Eighth Army that provided logistical, medical, and intelligence support. Advance units of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5 in the first encounter between American and North Korean troops. For the first month after the defeat at Osan, the 24th Infantry were repeatedly pushed back and forced southeastward by larger numbers of North Korean troops equipped with rugged Soviet-made T-34 tanks.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{continued}} defacement, fans rushed to the sites of the installments <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are announced. A group of men took advantage of this and threatened to deface a stencil painting of a beaver in East New York, charging money for people to take photographs. Some took {{matters into their own hands}} by guarding the works, others restoring them once defaced. In part because of the defacement, but also because of the great value of the artworks, property owners have also gone to extreme measures to protect the art. Some hired security guards, others covered the art with acrylic glass, and yet others installed metal roll-down gates.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were ready, {{the charges}} were blown and Nuneaton started to tow Likomba out of the harbour. Aboard Duchessa d'Aosta, 11 men {{had managed to get}} aboard from Vulcan; while one group planted charges on the anchor chains, another searched below decks {{collecting}} prisoners. Blowing the anchor chains, Vulcan started to tow Duchessa d'Aosta out of the harbour. The explosions had alerted the population of the town, who started to gather on the pier, but no attempts were made to stop the ships from leaving. Several anti-aircraft emplacements opened fire at imaginary targets, believing the explosions to have been caused by an aerial attack, but the six-inch guns protecting the harbour itself remained silent. From entering the harbour to leaving with the ships under tow, the operation had taken 30 minutes, without any losses to the raiding party.|$|E
5|$|Capybara {{gestation}} is 130–150 days, {{and produces}} {{a litter of}} four capybara young on average, but may produce between one and eight in a single litter. Birth is on land and the female rejoins the group {{within a few hours}} of delivering the newborn capybaras, which join the group <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are mobile. Within a week, the young can eat grass, but continue to suckle—from any female in the group—until weaned around 16 weeks. The young form a group within the main group. Alloparenting has been observed in this species. Breeding peaks between April and May in Venezuela and between October and November in Mato Grosso, Brazil.|$|E
