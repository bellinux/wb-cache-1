5000|$|Numerous {{complaints}} {{by investigators}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fit</b> {{between the federal}} regulations and its IRB review requirements {{as they relate to}} social science research have been received. Broad complaints range from the legitimacy of IRB review, the applicability of the concepts of risk as it pertains to social science (e.g., possibly unneeded, over-burdensome requirements), and the requirements for the documentation of participants' informed consent (i.e., consent forms). Social scientists have criticized biomedical IRBs for failing to adequately understand their research methods (such as ethnography). In 2003, the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), in conjunction with the Oral History Association and American Historical Association, issued a formal statement that taking oral histories, unstructured interviews (as if for a piece of journalism), collecting anecdotes, and similar free speech activities often do not constitute [...] "human subject research" [...] as defined in the regulations and were never intended to be covered by clinical research rules.|$|E

40|$|The unitary equal-mass Fermi gas with zero-range {{interactions}} {{constitutes a}} paradigmatic model {{system that is}} relevant to atomic, condensed matter, nuclear, particle, and astro physics. This work determines the fourth-order virial coefficient b_ 4 of such a strongly-interacting Fermi gas using a customized ab initio path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) algorithm. In contrast to earlier theoretical results, which disagreed on the sign and magnitude of b_ 4, our b_ 4 agrees within error bars with the experimentally determined value, thereby resolving an ongoing literature debate. Utilizing a trap regulator, our PIMC approach determines the fourth-order virial coefficient by directly sampling the partition function.

Workplace identity analogously refers to the perceived fit between a person’s sense of self and the workplace’s norms and practices. We accordingly asked apprentices if, for example, they feel like a part of their company, if they draw satisfaction from working for it, if they consider their company as fitting to them, and if they are proud to be a part of their company.|$|E
