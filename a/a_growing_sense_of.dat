Furthermore, implicit and sometimes explicit promises made during the War of Liberation engendered an expectation of popular sovereignty and widespread participation in the political process, promises that largely went unfulfilled once peace had been achieved. Agitation by student organizations led such conservative leaders as Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich, to fear the rise of national sentiment; the assassination of German dramatist August von Kotzebue in March 1819 by a radical student seeking unification was followed on 20 September 1819 by the proclamation of the Carlsbad Decrees, which hampered intellectual leadership of the nationalist movement.|$|E

This gave way to the debate around the operationalization of CSR during the 1980 ’s and into the early 1990 ’s which brought forward a new understanding of the concept as a decision making process (see: Jones 1980) and was accompanied by the proposal of models and frameworks for its implementation (see: Cochran and Wood 1984; Strand 1983; Tuzzolino and Armandi 1981). In 1991, Carroll (1991) presented the “Pyramid of Corporate Social Responsibility” to represent what he defined as the four main responsibilities of any company and explicitly placing specific responsibilities on corporations.

Reform of the academic orders, new curricula and radical changes to the teaching staff ushered in a new season of intense teaching and scientific work at the University.

Scholars have already  gone some way in describing this role. However, Sanusi’s response to colonialism has, in comparison, almost gone unnoticed. Generally, Sanusi’s works were published while he was in exile, which happened shortly after his return from Mecca. For example, one of his critical works of colonialism was Malja’ Al-Ṭālibīn, a Sundanese Qur’anic exegesis in pegon script which circulated in 1930 - 1931.
