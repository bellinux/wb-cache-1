The evaluation of the DNA integrity during the exam of bovine fresh and frozen sperm is of fundamental importance to avoid embryonic losses.

40|$|Biscay-AGL Observatory. Since 1991, {{shelf and}} slope {{waters of the}} Southern Bay of Biscay are {{regularly}} sampled in a monthly hydrographical section north of Santander to a maximum depth of 2500 m, {{as part of the}} IEO Radiales program. On June 2007, an ocean-meteorological buoy (AGL) was moored at the end of Santander standard section, 22 nm north at 2850 m depth, to complete the ocean information with the ocean-atmosphere interaction. All of them are part of IEO Observing System (1). The integrated system of AGL and its nearest hydrographic station (2600 m depth) is named Biscay-AGL observatory. It is also one station for the EU FixO 3 project. Joint resources and systematic analysis lead to a powerful tool, which is much more than the combination of the AGL buoy and the hydrographical samplings. Data Access. All AGL buoy collected data are added to the local database sited at IEO-Santander in real-time and, after rutinary automatised quality controls, they are immediately available through its dedicated webpage (www. boya_agl. st. ieo. es). Monthly CTDO 2 data from the hydrographic section are lab-calibrated in order to obtain <b>acurated</b> values of salinity, dissolved oxygen and density, and added to the long-term time series. Biscay-AGL data are quality controlled, flagged and formatted according internationally agreed standards (2, 3) and routinely sent to the IEO Datacenter. This added-value controlled data are incorporated to the IEO permanent archive and made freely available through the SeaDataNet infrastructure for data access and discovery. Derived products. Data acquired by Biscay-AGL may be displayed as timeseries as usual, but end-users are benefited by derived products which provide direct information. A recently developed software tool produces not only timeseries of several parameters at different time resolutions but also derived products, both real and delayed time. Derived products from this buoy include, but not only, annual cycles as well as anomalous values, air-sea heat fluxes, salinity and water temperature anomalies, subinertial currents series, chlorophyll surface series, estimations of the mixed layer depth and wind and currents roses. Sensor Web Enablement (SWE). Sensor Web infrastructures are setup to access real-time data observed by sensors. This system has been implemented in AGL buoy sensors in order to simplify the retrieved events and alerts triggered through sensors. All those functionalities of the Sensor Web are provided in an interoperable way, following the standards stablished by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). By defining standardized service interfaces, these services hides the heterogeneity of the sensor network, its communication details, enabling the access to archived sensor data that can be discovered and accessed using standard protocols and application programming interfaces...|$|R

BackgroundTranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been initially considered as an alternative for high-risk patients with aortic stenosis. Although the current experience is limited, TAVR might be also an alternative to treat patients with pure, severe AR. MethodsBetween April 2012 and December 2013, a total of 8 high-risk patients with pure, severe AR were enrolled (grade III+). Clinical and hemodynamic data as well as data on device and procedure parameters and outcomes were collected. ResultsPatient mean was 72. 5 ± 8. 4 years, and 37. 5 % of patients were female. Logistic EuroSCORE was 34. 0 ± 7. 9 % and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 7. 3 ± 3. 3 % on average. Two patients had undergone emergency aortic operation before due to acute type A aortic dissection, and both were treated by replacement of the ascending aorta (including root reconstruction) and the aortic arch combined with or without E-vita Open stent graft (Jotec GmbH, Hechingen, Germany) (January 2011 and March 2012), whereas the other patients experienced primary AR. All patients underwent successful transapical TAVR with the transapical <b>ACURATE</b> TA device (size small, n = 1, size medium, n = 3, size large, n = 4) without any intraprocedural complications according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium 2  criteria.

40|$|BackgroundThe {{morphology}} of the LAA {{is extremely}} heterogeneous. <b>Acurate</b> sizing {{of the landing}} zone is crucial for the optimal choice of the device diameter. Cardiac CT {{has been shown to}} provide <b>acurate</b> measurement of the LAA. TOE and selective LAA angiography can provide discordant results during the procedure, and there is no consensus about the most reliable imaging modality. AimCompare the sizing of the LAA using a multimodality imaging approach. Methods and resultsWe retrospectively included 45 patients (aged 67. 6 ± 6. 2 years) who underwent LAA occlusion using the Amplatzer® cardiac plug (ACP). Mean diameter of the landing zone was determined using the different imaging modalities: MPR for cardiac-CT and 3 D TOE, multiple angle view at 0, 45, 90 and 120 ° using 2 D TOE, and monoplanar projection (RAO 30 ° cranial 20 °) for angiography. High intra and inter observer reproductibility were found for diameter (r= 0. 93 and 0. 87, p< 0. 01 respectively with mean difference of – 0. 1 mm [– 1. 9;+ 1. 8] and – 0. 2 mm [– 2. 9;+ 2. 5] respectively) and area measurement (r 0. 94 and 0. 88, p< 0. 01 respectively, with a mean difference of 0 cm 2 [– 0. 15;+ 0. 16] and 0 cm 2 [– 0. 9;+ 0. 9], respectively) of the landing zone by CT. 2 D TEE mean diameter was underestimated compared to CT (– 2. 6 mm [– 3. 1;+ 8. 3]) that was reduced to – 1. 8 mm [– 3. 6;+ 7. 1] when a 120 ° view was available. 3 D TEE also underestimated LAA diameter (- 2 mm [– 2. 7;+ 6. 7]). Angiographic diameter was weakly correlated with CT (r= 0. 35, – 1. 4 mm [– 5. 7;+ 8. 5]). ConclusionsWe found significant variability in the sizing of the LAA landing zone, using different imaging modalities. 3 D data set provided by Cardiac-CT and 3 D TOE looks interesting to get a complete overview of LAA anatomy. Multiple angle view from 0 to 120 ° are mandatory when using 2 D TOE.

40|$|Introduction : Transapical {{aortic valve}} {{implantation}} (TA-AVI) {{has been widely}} introduced for treatment of patients with severe aortic stenosis in the last decade. Here we report our first clinical experience with 10 patients using the second-generation transapical Symetis <b>Acurate</b> TA aortic valve designed for transapical implantation. Aim : To evaluate the results of transapical access in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) among patients with unsuitable vascular access. Material and methods : All patients had been assessed by a local heart team and were disqualified from surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) and the transfemoral TAVI approach. Mean age was 75. 4 ± 3. 9 years (range: 68 – 80), with 20 % being female. Logistic EuroSCORE (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation) and STS (Society of Thoracic Surgeons) were 15. 4 ± 8. 9 % and 20. 5 ± 4. 5 %, respectively. Results : All implantations were performed successfully in the intra-annular and subcoronary position. There were no conversions to surgical AVR. All patients survived 30 -day follow-up. No strokes or transient ischemic attacks were reported. There {{was no need for}} pacemaker implantation and none of the patients demonstrated moderate or significant paravalvular leakage. The mean aortic gradients improved significantly from a baseline of 57. 0 ± 19. 2 mm Hg to a 30 -day value of 14. 2 ± 4. 1 mm Hg.
