5|$|Repairs and {{alterations}} of {{the power}} plant continued until 1904, when the continuing boiler failures compelled the Navy to dispense with oil fuel <b>and</b> <b>convert</b> Rostislav to coal in 1904 and 1905.

5|$|From {{the early}} 12th century onwards the Normans {{began to build}} new castles in stone <b>and</b> <b>convert</b> {{existing}} timber designs. This was initially a slow process, picking up speed towards {{the second half of}} the century. Traditionally this transition was believed to have been driven by the more crude nature of wooden fortifications, the limited life of timber in wooden castles and its vulnerability to fire; recent archaeological studies have however shown that many wooden castles were as robust and as complex as their stone equivalents. Some wooden castles were not converted into stone for many years and instead expanded in wood, such as at Hen Domen.|$|E

The redevelopment by CZero Developments consists of 73 private apartments in both the chapel and the Sunday school, with the redevelopment due to be completed by Summer 2017.

5|$|In {{the early}} years of Basil I's reign, Arab raids on the coasts of Dalmatia were {{successfully}} repelled, and the region once again came under secure Byzantine control.

An attempt to retake Malta ended disastrously, however, when the local population sided with the Arabs and massacred the Byzantine garrison.|$|E
5|$|Instrumentalism {{became popular}} among {{physicists}} {{around the turn}} of the 20th century, after which logical positivism defined the field for several decades. Logical positivism accepts only testable statements as meaningful, rejects metaphysical interpretations, and embraces verificationism (a set of theories of knowledge that combines logicism, empiricism, and linguistics to ground philosophy on a basis consistent with examples from the empirical sciences). Seeking to overhaul all of philosophy <b>and</b> <b>convert</b> it to a new scientific philosophy, the Berlin Circle and the Vienna Circle propounded logical positivism in the late 1920s.|$|E
5|$|JMP is {{a desktop}} {{application}} with a wizard-based user interface, while SAS {{can be installed}} on servers. It runs in-memory, instead of on disk storage. According to a review in Pharmaceutical Statistics, JMP is often used as a graphical front-end for a SAS system, which performs the statistical analysis and tabulations. JMP Genomics, used for analyzing and visualizing genomics data, requires a SAS component to operate and can access SAS/Genetics and SAS/STAT procedures or invoke SAS macros. JMP Clinical, used for analyzing clinical trial data, can package SAS code within the JSL scripting language <b>and</b> <b>convert</b> SAS code to JMP.|$|E

The Government did not pursue them; apparently its officials considered they had been sufficiently punished.|$|E

5|$|Meg {{catches the}} mumps when the Griffins attend Quahog's annual Star Trek convention, because Peter {{forced her to}} stand next to an irresponsible {{attendee}} with mumps to take a picture, believing him to be in costume as an alien.

Meg is horrified to learn that Brian is an atheist and attempts to convince him to repent <b>and</b> <b>convert</b> to Christianity, but he repeatedly refuses. Finally taking drastic measures, Meg spreads the word of Brian's atheism around Quahog, which generally hates atheists, making him a social outcast.|$|E

5|$|Sviatoslav {{had several}} children, but {{the origin of}} his wives is not {{specified}} in the chronicle. By his wives, he had Yaropolk and Oleg. By Malusha, a woman of indeterminate origins, Sviatoslav had Vladimir, who would ultimately break with his father's paganism <b>and</b> <b>convert</b> Rus' to Christianity. John Skylitzes reported that Vladimir had a brother named Sfengus; whether this Sfengus was a son of Sviatoslav, a son of Malusha by a prior or subsequent husband, or an unrelated Rus' nobleman is unclear.|$|E
5|$|The Prussian uprisings {{were two}} major and three smaller uprisings by the Prussians, {{one of the}} Baltic tribes, against the Teutonic Knights {{that took place in}} the 13th century during the Prussian Crusade. The crusading {{military}} order, supported by the Popes and Christian Europe, sought to conquer <b>and</b> <b>convert</b> the pagan Prussians. In the first ten years of the crusade five of the seven major Prussian clans fell under the control of the less numerous Teutonic Knights. However, the Prussians rose against their conquerors on five occasions.|$|E
5|$|A {{very well}} {{understood}} example of extrinsic control is {{the regulation of}} glucose metabolism by the hormone insulin. Insulin is produced in response to rises in blood glucose levels. Binding of the hormone to insulin receptors on cells then activates a cascade of protein kinases that cause the cells to take up glucose <b>and</b> <b>convert</b> it into storage molecules such as fatty acids and glycogen. The metabolism of glycogen is controlled by activity of phosphorylase, the enzyme that breaks down glycogen, and glycogen synthase, the enzyme that makes it. These enzymes are regulated in a reciprocal fashion, with phosphorylation inhibiting glycogen synthase, but activating phosphorylase. Insulin causes glycogen synthesis by activating protein phosphatases and producing {{a decrease in the}} phosphorylation of these enzymes.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} model {{assumes that}} PrPSc exists only as fibrils, and that fibril ends bind PrPC <b>and</b> <b>convert</b> it into PrPSc. If this were all, then {{the quantity of}} prions would increase linearly, forming ever longer fibrils. But exponential growth of both PrPSc and of the quantity of infectious particles is observed during prion disease. This {{can be explained by}} taking into account fibril breakage. A mathematical solution for the exponential growth rate resulting from the combination of fibril growth and fibril breakage has been found. The exponential growth rate depends largely on the square root of the PrPC concentration. The incubation period is determined by the exponential growth rate, and in vivo data on prion diseases in transgenic mice match this prediction. The same square root dependence is also seen in vitro in experiments with a variety of different amyloid proteins.|$|E
5|$|An online version, Black & White: The Gathering, was in development, {{and would}} have enabled creatures to {{interact}} those of other players in a cut-down game environment over the internet. Lionhead planned to release Black & White: The Gathering {{two months before the}} main game's release as a free download, and it was to offer a choice of creatures. It would have linked with chat programs such as AOL instant messenger and ICQ <b>and</b> <b>convert</b> text to a speech bubble from the creature. It was intended for players to be able to upload the main game's creature into Black & White: The Gathering and its experiences to be saved into the main game. Another online program, Black & White Worlds, was in development. This would have taken place in the worlds of the main game. Molyneux explained that there was to be a server, whose worlds would have been set up with a match-making system and players {{would have been able to}} do battle, like last man standing. There was also a plan to produce Black & White Universe, in which players would have had a persistent online world.|$|E
5|$|Dishonored is an action-adventure {{game played}} from a first-person {{perspective}} {{with an emphasis}} on stealth action and the use of gadgets and the environment to eliminate opposing forces. The game world is a series of self-contained, mission-focused areas designed for multiple avenues of exploration in terms of in-game movement and powers. Between missions, the player is taken to a central hub called the Hound Pits pub where the player character Corvo can meet with his allies, receive mission briefings and alternate objectives, <b>and</b> <b>convert</b> recovered loot into new equipment and upgrades. In-game areas include loading docks, royal estates, poverty-stricken streets, and a bathhouse. The player can save their progress anywhere, and the game includes a checkpoint save system. Saving is disabled during combat. The game has four difficulty levels which modify the effectiveness of health and mana (magic) potions, and enemies' awareness, damage delivered, and responsiveness. In the easy setting, health regeneration is possible.|$|E
