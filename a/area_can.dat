5|$|The GCD can be visualized as follows. Consider a {{rectangular}} area a by b, and any common divisor c that divides both a and b exactly. The {{sides of the}} rectangle {{can be divided into}} segments of length c, which divides the rectangle into a grid of squares of side length c. The greatest common divisor g is the largest value of c for which this is possible. For illustration, a 24-by-60 rectangular <b>area</b> <b>can</b> be divided into a grid of: 1-by-1 squares, 2-by-2 squares, 3-by-3 squares, 4-by-4 squares, 6-by-6 squares or 12-by-12 squares. Therefore, 12 is the greatest common divisor of 24 and 60. A 24-by-60 rectangular <b>area</b> <b>can</b> be divided into a grid of 12-by-12 squares, with two squares along one edge (24/12=2) and five squares along the other (60/12=5).|$|E
5|$|A new viticultural area {{along the}} Snake River was {{established}} on April 9, 2007. Principally located in Idaho, the area also encompasses two large counties in Eastern Oregon, Baker County and Malheur County. The region's climate is unique among AVAs in Oregon; the average temperature is relatively cool and rainfall is low, creating a shorter growing season. Current production {{is led by}} hardy grapes such as Riesling, Gew√ºrztraminer, and Chardonnay. The climate also lends itself extremely well {{to the production of}} ice wine. However, the AVA is quite large and warmer microclimates within the <b>area</b> <b>can</b> also support different types of grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.|$|E

5|$|The city {{generally}} slopes {{from the}} highest point in the Northeast to the lowest point in the Southwest towards the Missouri River. Prominent tributaries of the river are Perche Creek, Hinkson Creek, and Flat Branch Creek. Along these and other creeks in the <b>area</b> <b>can</b> be found large valleys, cliffs, and cave systems such as that in Rock Bridge State Park {{just south of the}} city. These creeks are largely responsible for numerous stream valleys giving Columbia hilly terrain similar to the Ozarks while also having prairie flatland typical of northern Missouri. Columbia also operates several greenbelts with trails and parks throughout town.|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} Pacific Coast {{breakpoints}} in the United States. They are, {{from north to}} south, Point Piedras Blancas, Point Sal, Point Conception, Point Mugu, {{the mouth of the}} San Gabriel River, San Mateo Point, and the mouth of the Tijuana River (although places outside this <b>area</b> <b>can</b> be selected if conditions warrant). Should there be the threat of landfall, warnings or watches would be issued for those sections of coast. It is highly unlikely that any tropical cyclone will threaten areas farther north due to the stronger influence of the California Current.|$|E
5|$|Wing {{areas are}} delimited and {{subdivided}} by fold-lines along which the wing can fold, and flexion-lines along which the wing can flex during flight. The fundamental {{distinction between the}} flexion-lines and the fold-lines is often blurred, as fold-lines may permit some flexibility or vice versa. Two constants that are found in nearly all insect wings are the claval (a flexion-line) and jugal folds (or fold line); forming variable and unsatisfactory boundaries. Wing foldings can very complicated, with transverse folding occurs in the hindwings of Dermaptera and Coleoptera, and in some insects the anal <b>area</b> <b>can</b> be folded like a fan.|$|E

5|$|Yellowstone National Park is the {{centerpiece}} of the 20million acre/31,250square-mile (8,093,712ha/80,937km2) Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, a region that includes Grand Teton National Park, adjacent National Forests and expansive wilderness areas in those forests. The ecosystem is the largest remaining continuous stretch of mostly undeveloped pristine land in the continental United States, considered the world's largest intact ecosystem in the northern temperate zone. With the successful wolf reintroduction program, which began in the 1990s, virtually all the original faunal species known to inhabit the region when white explorers first entered the <b>area</b> <b>can</b> still be found there.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the signal}} {{light in the}} {{locomotive}} turns green, the journey from the Main Street, U.S.A. section begins with the train traversing a small bridge, passing by the Adventureland section, and going through a tunnel before arriving at New Orleans Square Station in the New Orleans Square section. While the train is stopped at this station, where the locomotive takes on water from the railroad's water tower if needed, a sound effect of a telegraph operator using a telegraph key to enter Morse code can be heard emanating from the old Frontierland Station depot building. The sound effect continuously repeats the first two lines of Walt Disney's 1955 Disneyland dedication speech. Adjacent to the old Frontierland Station depot building, a freight house building used as a train crew break and storage <b>area</b> <b>can</b> be seen, {{as well as a}} fully functioning historic semaphore signal connected to the station's block signal.|$|E
5|$|Over {{half the}} red-backed fairywrens in an <b>area</b> <b>can</b> {{be found in}} pairs during the mating season. This is {{apparently}} a defence against the resource-limited nature of the environment. It {{is more difficult to}} maintain a larger interdependent group during dry spells, so the birds try to stay in pairs or smaller groups, which include adults that help parents look after young. Paternity tests have shown that an older male with bright plumage has much more success in the mating season and can mate with more than one female. Accordingly, it has higher sperm storage and makes more mating overtures towards females. A male with browner and less bright plumage or a younger male with bright plumage has a much lower success rate than a bright, older male for mating. Further, an unpaired male serves as a helper to a mated pair in feeding and care of young. When the male pairs his bill darkens, and this happens within three weeks. This is much easier to control than plumage, as moulting takes time and is controlled by seasonality. The bill is vascular and much easier to change in response to the pairings.|$|E

5|$|SMAW welding, {{like other}} welding methods, {{can be a}} {{dangerous}} and unhealthy practice if proper precautions are not taken. The process uses an open electric arc, which presents a risk of burns which are prevented by personal protective equipment {{in the form of}} heavy leather gloves and long sleeve jackets. Additionally, the brightness of the weld <b>area</b> <b>can</b> lead to a condition called arc eye, in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Welding helmets with dark face plates are worn to prevent this exposure, and in recent years, new helmet models have been produced that feature a face plate that self-darkens upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. To protect bystanders, especially in industrial environments, translucent welding curtains often surround the welding area. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc, but should not be used to replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide (SiC), {{also known}} as {{carborundum}} , is a semiconductor containing silicon and carbon with chemical formula SiC. It occurs in nature as the extremely rare mineral moissanite. Synthetic silicon carbide powder has been mass-produced since 1893 for use as an abrasive. Grains of silicon carbide can be bonded together by sintering to form very hard ceramics that are widely used in applications requiring high endurance, such as car brakes, car clutches and ceramic plates in bulletproof vests. Electronic applications of silicon carbide such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and detectors in early radios were first demonstrated around 1907. SiC is used in semiconductor electronics devices that operate at high temperatures or high voltages, or both. Large single crystals of silicon carbide can be grown by the Lely method; they can be cut into gems known as synthetic moissanite. Silicon carbide with high surface <b>area</b> <b>can</b> be produced from SiO2 contained in plant material.|$|E
5|$|The South-West Indian Ocean {{is located}} within the Southern Hemisphere between the Africa's east coast and 90¬∞E and is {{primarily}} monitored by the Meteo France's La Reunion RSMC, while the Mauritian, Australian Indonesian, and Malagasy weather services also monitor parts of it. Until {{the start of the}} 1985‚Äì86 tropical cyclone season the basin only extended to 80¬∞E, with the 10 degrees between 80 and 90E considered {{to be a part of}} the Australian region. On average about 9 cyclones per develop into tropical storms, while 5 of those go on to become tropical cyclones that are equivalent to a hurricane or a typhoon. The tropical cyclones that form in this <b>area</b> <b>can</b> affect some of the various Indian Ocean island nations and or various countries along Africa's east coast.|$|E

5|$|The {{region has}} {{considerable}} vertical relief in its landscapes {{that are not}} in the alluvial plains leading to the bay or in inland valleys. The topography, and geologic history, of the Bay <b>Area</b> <b>can</b> largely be attributed to the compressive forces between the Pacific Plate and the North American plate. The three major ridge structures in the Bay Area, part of the Pacific Coast Range, are all roughly parallel to the major faults. The Santa Cruz Mountains along the San Francisco Peninsula and the Marin Hills in Marin County follow the San Andreas fault, The Berkeley Hills, San Leandro Hills and their southern ridgeline extension through Mission Peak roughly follow the Hayward fault, and the Diablo Range, which includes Mount Diablo and Mount Hamilton and runs along the Calaveras fault.|$|E
5|$|The {{scope of}} ecology {{contains}} {{a wide array}} of interacting levels of organization spanning micro-level (e.g., cells) to a planetary scale (e.g., biosphere) phenomena. Ecosystems, for example, contain abiotic resources and interacting life forms (i.e., individual organisms that aggregate into populations which aggregate into distinct ecological communities). Ecosystems are dynamic, they do not always follow a linear successional path, but they are always changing, sometimes rapidly and sometimes so slowly that it can take thousands of years for ecological processes to bring about certain successional stages of a forest. An ecosystem's <b>area</b> <b>can</b> vary greatly, from tiny to vast. A single tree is of little consequence to the classification of a forest ecosystem, but critically relevant to organisms living in and on it. Several generations of an aphid population can exist over the lifespan of a single leaf. Each of those aphids, in turn, support diverse bacterial communities. The nature of connections in ecological communities cannot be explained by knowing the details of each species in isolation, because the emergent pattern is neither revealed nor predicted until the ecosystem is studied as an integrated whole. Some ecological principles, however, do exhibit collective properties where the sum of the components explain the properties of the whole, such as birth rates of a population being equal to the sum of individual births over a designated time frame.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{has four}} stands. The Main Stand (renamed the Garrison Lane Stand from 2010 to 2012), a {{free-standing}} structure {{on the north}} side of the playing area, was completed in 1954 and has seating for fewer than 5,000 spectators. The upper tier contains the media area and an area of corporate seats as well as standard seating. The lower tier, known as the Paddocks, consists of a few rows of seats placed on the uncovered terraced area in front of the stand; the view from this <b>area</b> <b>can</b> be obstructed by the central tunnel and the dugouts. A row of executive boxes was added at the back of the Paddocks in the 1970s. The family area is divided between the eastern end of the Main Stand and the Paddock beneath. The club planned ¬£1.3million worth of restructuring and refurbishment work on the stand, which contained hospitality areas and offices, during the 2009 closed season, and seating was replaced in 2010. The broadcasting gantry is situated in the roof of this stand.|$|E
