Young concluded that his medical symptomsmdash&including his past relapses, fevers and hepatic conditionsmdash&were {{much closer to}} those resulting from hepatic <b>amoebiasis,</b> an illness then widespread in Madras, rather than tuberculosis. He had two episodes of dysentery before he left India. When not properly treated, dysentery can lie dormant for years and lead to hepatic <b>amoebiasis,</b> whose diagnosis was not then well established. <b>Amoebiasis</b> was a treatable and often curable disease at the time.|$|E
25|$|Metronidazole is {{primarily}} used to treat: bacterial vaginosis, {{pelvic inflammatory disease}} (along with other antibacterials like ceftriaxone), pseudomembranous colitis, aspiration pneumonia, rosacea (topical), fungating wounds (topical), intra-abdominal infections, lung abscess, periodontitis, <b>amoebiasis,</b> oral infections, giardiasis, trichomoniasis, and infections caused by susceptible anaerobic organisms such as Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Prevotella species. It is also often used to eradicate Helicobacter pylori along with other drugs and to prevent infection in people recovering from surgery.|$|E
500|$|In 1919, {{ill health}} – now {{believed}} to have been hepatic <b>amoebiasis</b> (a complication from episodes of dysentery many years previously) – compelled Ramanujan's return to India, where he died in 1920 at the age of 32. His last letters to Hardy, written January 1920, show that he was still continuing to produce new mathematical ideas and theorems. His [...] "lost notebook", containing discoveries from {{the last year of his}} life, caused great excitement among mathematicians when it was rediscovered in 1976.|$|E
2500|$|Rationing of {{utilities}} {{of electricity}} and water began to increase into 2016. Shortages of water in Venezuela resulted in the Bolivarian government mandating the rationing of water, with many Venezuelans no longer being able to freely have water enter their homes and instead relied on the government to provide water a few times monthly. Desperate Venezuelans often displayed their frustrations through protests and began to steal water [...] "from swimming pools, public buildings, and even tanker trucks" [...] in order to survive. Due to the shortages of water, there were [...] "increased cases of diseases such as scabies, malaria, diarrhea and <b>amoebiasis</b> in the country", according to Miguel Viscuña, Director of Epidemiology of the Health Corporation of Central Miranda ...|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{parasitology}} {{developed in}} the 19th century with accurate observations by several researchers and clinicians. In 1828, James Annersley described <b>amoebiasis,</b> protozoal infections of the intestines and the liver, though the pathogen, Entamoeba histolytica, was not discovered until 1873 by Friedrich Lösch. James Paget discovered the intestinal nematode Trichinella spiralis in humans in 1835. [...] James McConnell described the human liver fluke in 1875. Patrick Manson discovered {{the life cycle of}} elephantiasis, caused by nematode worms transmitted by mosquitoes, in 1877. Manson further predicted that the malaria parasite, Plasmodium, had a mosquito vector, and persuaded Ronald Ross to investigate. Ross confirmed that the prediction was correct in 1897–1898. At the same time, Giovanni Battista Grassi and others described the malaria parasite's life cycle stages in Anopheles mosquitoes. Ross was controversially awarded the 1902 Nobel prize for his work, while Grassi was not.|$|E

About 480 million people are {{infected}} with <b>amoebiasis</b> and this result {{in the death of}} between 40,000-110,000 people a year. Most infections are now believed to be due to E. dispar. E. dispar is more common in certain areas and symptomatic cases may be less common than previously reported. The first case of <b>amoebiasis</b> was documented in 1875 and in 1891 the disease was described in detail, resulting in the terms amoebic dysentery and amoebic liver abscess. Further evidence from the Philippines in 1913 found that upon swallowing cysts of E. histolytica volunteers developed the disease.|$|E

50|$|Prevention of <b>amoebiasis</b> is by {{improved}} sanitation, including separating {{food and}} water from faeces. There is no vaccine. There are two treatment options depending on {{the location of the}} infection. <b>Amoebiasis</b> in tissues is treated with either metronidazole, tinidazole, nitazoxanide, dehydroemetine or chloroquine, while luminal infection is treated with diloxanide furoate or iodoquinoline. For treatment to be effective against all stages of disease may require a combination of medications. Infections without symptoms do not require treatment but infected individuals can spread the parasite to others and treatment can be considered. Treatment of other Entamoeba infections apart from E. histolytica is not needed.|$|E
