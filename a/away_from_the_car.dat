Bryant shot Janet Quin in the back, where she fell, unable to move, near Royce Thompson.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} victim {{linked to the}} Michigan Murderer was a 19-year-old Eastern Michigan University {{accounting}} student named Mary Terese Fleszar, who was last seen alive {{on the evening of}} July 9, 1967, by a neighbor walking towards her Ypsilanti apartment. This neighbor twice observed {{a young man in a}} blue-grey Chevrolet slow to a halt beside Fleszar and begin talking to her: each time, Fleszar had shook her head and walked <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Her nude body was found by two 15-year-old boys on an abandoned farm in Superior Township on August 7, and was formally identified via dental records the following day.|$|E
25|$|Just {{before midnight}} on July 4, 1969, Darlene Ferrin and Michael Mageau {{drove into the}} Blue Rock Springs Park in Vallejo, four miles from the Lake Herman Road murder site, and parked. While the couple sat in Ferrin's car, a second car drove into the lot and parked {{alongside}} them but almost immediately drove away. Returning about 10 minutes later, this second car parked behind them. The driver of the second car then exited the vehicle, approaching the passenger side door of Ferrin's car, carrying a flashlight and a 9mm Luger. The killer directed the flashlight into Mageau's and Ferrin's eyes before shooting at them, firing five times. Both victims were hit, and several bullets had passed through Mageau and into Ferrin. The killer walked <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> but upon hearing Mageau's moaning, returned and shot each victim twice more before driving off.|$|E

500|$|The video commences {{with a short}} {{segment of}} {{dramatic}} music. It then focuses on Cyrus, wearing a white tank top, jeans, boots and a black leather jacket, and her boyfriend leaving a movie theater and discussing the movie they saw. Suddenly, Cyrus' boyfriend begins to cough as a full moon emerges from behind the clouds. Cyrus is confused, then horrified as she watches him transform into a paparazzi, and runs away from him as he shouts [...] "Miley, come here! I just want a couple of shots!" [...] and tries to snap pictures of her. The music of [...] "Fly on the Wall" [...] begins as Cyrus runs into a parking garage and tries to hide behind a pillar and a black Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren. As soon as Cyrus tries to move <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> a mob of paparazzi begins to chase her with their cameras. Throughout much of the video, Cyrus runs and hides from the mob. Clips interspaced throughout the video feature her in a long silver shirt and jeans singing and dancing {{in front of the}} Mercedes. Eventually, Cyrus is cornered by the paparazzi. She is scared, but then surprised and perplexed when the mob unexpectedly begins to dance in a synchronized manner. Her boyfriend, appearing normal, then arrives in the Mercedes to rescue her. Inside the car, Cyrus describes her strange encounter with the paparazzi to him. Unknown to Cyrus, her boyfriend has planted a video camera in the car; the music video concludes with a shot of the website he posts the video on beneath the headline, [...] "Miley Cyrus Bugs at Paparazzi!!!" [...] The music video to [...] "Fly on the Wall" [...] was first seen on December 5, 2008 on MTV's FNMTV. The video is inspired by Michael Jackson's iconic music video, [...] "Thriller", but trades zombies for paparazzi. MTV also compared the [...] "Fly on the Wall" [...] video for those for [...] "Circus" [...] by Britney Spears and [...] "Rumors" [...] by Lindsay Lohan.|$|E

2500|$|The Batmobile's shields {{are made}} of ceramic fractal armor panels. They explode outward when struck by projectiles, {{deflecting}} injurious force <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and its occupants. If Batman must leave the Batmobile {{for an extended period}} of time, he can, through a voice command spoken into a wrist device (specifically, the word [...] "shields"), activate the Batmobile's shielding system. This prevents anyone from tampering with the vehicle while it is left unattended. Bulletproof and fireproof steel armor plates envelop the body and cockpit entirely. While this armor is in place, the vehicle cannot be driven. In Batman the shields were not fully functioning. In reality, a life-size model was built, and the shield activation sequence was created with stop motion animation technology. In Batman Returns, the shields held the same characteristics. However, the design was slimmer and the special effects were provided by computer-generated imagery. In shield mode, a small but powerful bomb can be deployed.|$|E
2500|$|Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, {{issued an}} {{official}} statement on October 4, 2013. The statement {{said that a}} curved piece of metal from a semi-trailer that had fallen on the roadway appeared to have impaled the [...] plate {{on the base of}} the vehicle. According to the statement, in order for the object to have made a [...] diameter hole in the plate, the object must have had enough leverage to produce approximately [...] After the driver exited the car, the statement continued, the frontmost of the car's 16 battery modules caught fire due to the initial damage, but the battery pack's internal firewalls kept the fire from spreading and vents directed the flames <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> down towards the pavement. The statement also noted that the fire never entered the passenger compartment. According to Tesla, the firefighters observed standard procedure, and gained access to the source of the fire by puncturing holes {{in the top of the}} battery’s protective metal plate and applying water. However, the company noted that although the water and dry-chemical fire extinguisher quickly put out the fire, the firefighters should not have punctured the firewall since the new holes allowed flames to enter the front trunk of the vehicle. Musk closed the official statement explaining that the result of this accident could have been [...] "far worse" [...] had a conventional gasoline-powered car encountered the same object on the highway, because most gasoline cars do not have an armored underbody, leaving the fuel lines and tank vulnerable. He also noted that Tesla's battery pack only contains about 10% as much energy as a standard tank of gasoline and it is divided into 16 sections means that the combustion potential is about 1% of a comparable gasoline-powered car. Based on U.S. statistics from the National Fire Protection Association, Musk's statement claimed that a fire was five times more likely in a gasoline car than in a Tesla car.|$|E

50|$|Peristeria (Greek: Περιστέρια, {{population}} 456) is a {{small village}} in the southeast of the island 45 km from Salamis City. It took its name <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bird of peace, the dove (Greek: περιστέρι), {{because it is a}} calm, peaceful and isolated place, <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> and <b>from</b> noise. Another interpretation says that its name may be derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> doves which were living and had nests in the area.The area has a marina, which has yachts and fishing boats. The beaches of Peristeria are the cleanest of Salamis. The village is near the Cave of Euripides, associated with the famous ancient playwright.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2017 Brad Anderson of CarScoops {{stated that}} he prefers Top Gear versus The Grand Tour. According to Anderson, Top Gear had [...] "become even better", whereas the Grand Tour [...] "seemed more scripted, less natural and at stages, forced … {{attention}} is often skewed <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> as <b>the</b> presenters, namely Clarkson, seemed to chase controversy and headlines". Anderson continues that in-studio segments became repetitive quickly, particularly [...] "Celebrity Brain Crash", also noting that all three The Grand Tour hosts seem to spend far too much time needling each other, and test driver Mike Skinner offers no worthwhile commentary.|$|R
2500|$|As well {{as being}} sold in the North American market, third-generation models were {{imported}} to many other countries, in left and right-hand drive configurations. However, this action proved unsuccessful. Exported models wore Mercury Sable headlamps, a unique front bumper cover to conform to these countries' regulations regarding automotive lighting. Right-hand-drive versions used a hand-operated parking brake in the center console instead of a foot-operated parking brake as in North America. Australians tended to stay <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars,</b> due to their high price; a well-equipped, larger-engined rear-wheel drive Ford Fairmont cost around the same amount. Australian buyers could only opt for a single-spec sedan, known as the Taurus Ghia. However, in New Zealand the Taurus was quite popular. Whereas Australia only saw the 1996 model, both the sedan and station wagon models were sold in New Zealand from 1996-1998.|$|R
