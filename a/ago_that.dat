5|$|An {{important}} theoretical {{decision for}} White {{is to choose}} whether to play a2–a3. While this move protects the b4 square and threatens the pawn advance b2–b4, it encourages Black's rook lift Ra8–a6–h6. As Lalic puts it:It was not so long <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> 8.a3, with the obvious intention of expanding with b2–b4, was the standard move. However, after Black responds with the logical a7–a5, it became apparent in tournament practice that the inclusion of these moves is in fact in Black's favour, as it gives his queen's rook access into play via the a6-square.|$|E
5|$|It is {{slightly}} larger than Pallas, though significantly more massive. Vesta is the last remaining rocky protoplanet (with a differentiated interior) {{of the kind that}} formed the terrestrial planets. Numerous fragments of Vesta were ejected by collisions one and two billion years <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> left two enormous craters occupying much of Vesta's southern hemisphere. Debris from these events has fallen to Earth as howardite–eucrite–diogenite (HED) meteorites, which have been a rich source of information about Vesta.|$|E
5|$|The {{three primary}} {{branches}} of Crocodilia had diverged {{by the end}} of the Mesozoic. The earliest-known members of the group are alligatoroids and gavialoids that lived in North America and Europe during the Campanian (around 83.6–72.1 million years ago). Although the first known crocodyloids appeared in the Maastrichtian (around 72.1–66.0 million years <b>ago),</b> <b>that</b> lineage must have been present during the Campanian, and the earliest alligatoroids and gavialoids include highly derived forms, which indicates that the time of the actual divergence between the three lineages must have been a pre-Campanian event.|$|E

5|$|Silver forces Jim {{to use the}} map, {{directing}} them to {{a portal}} that opens on any location in the universe, which Jim realizes is how Flint conducted his raids. They open the portal {{to the center of}} Treasure Planet, discovering that the planet is really a space station built eons <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> Flint commandeered to stow his treasure. As the pirates prepare to collect the loot, Jim finds the skeletal remains of Flint, holding the missing component to B.E.N.'s cognitive computer. He reinserts it, and B.E.N. immediately recalls that Flint rigged the planet to explode upon the treasure's discovery. As the planet begins to fall apart, Silver, trying to hold onto a boat-load of gold, opts to let it go to save Jim. The survivors escape to the Legacy, which is damaged and unable to leave the planet in time. Jim rigs a makeshift rocket-powered sailboard, and rides ahead of the Legacy towards the portal. At the last moment, Jim sets the portal to Montressor Spaceport, and both he and the Legacy safely clear the destruction.|$|E
5|$|The {{environment}} of the German Reeds' intimate theatre allowed Gilbert quickly to develop a personal style and freedom to control all aspects of production, including set, costumes, direction and stage management. These works were a success, with Gilbert's first big hit at the Gallery of Illustration, Ages Ago, opening in 1869. Ages Ago was also {{the beginning of a}} collaboration with the composer Frederic Clay that would last seven years and produce four works. It was at a rehearsal for Ages <b>Ago</b> <b>that</b> Clay formally introduced Gilbert to his friend, Arthur Sullivan. The Bab Ballads and Gilbert's many early musical works gave him much practice as a lyricist even before his collaboration with Sullivan.|$|E
5|$|When dinosaurs appeared, {{they were}} not the {{dominant}} terrestrial animals. The terrestrial habitats were occupied by various types of archosauromorphs and therapsids, like cynodonts and rhynchosaurs. Their main competitors were the pseudosuchia, such as aetosaurs, ornithosuchids and rauisuchians, which were more successful than the dinosaurs. Most of these other animals became extinct in the Triassic, in one of two events. First, at about 215million years ago, a variety of basal archosauromorphs, including the protorosaurs, became extinct. This was followed by the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event (about 200million years <b>ago),</b> <b>that</b> saw the end of most of the other groups of early archosaurs, like aetosaurs, ornithosuchids, phytosaurs, and rauisuchians. Rhynchosaurs and dicynodonts survived (at least in some areas) at least as late as early-mid Norian and early Rhaetian, respectively, and the exact date of their extinction is uncertain. These losses left behind a land fauna of crocodylomorphs, dinosaurs, mammals, pterosaurians, and turtles. The first few lines of early dinosaurs diversified through the Carnian and Norian stages of the Triassic, possibly by occupying the niches of the groups that became extinct.|$|E

25|$|Copper and its alloys (brasses, bronzes, cupronickel, copper-nickel-zinc, and others) {{are natural}} {{antimicrobial}} materials.

25|$|It was {{discovered}} 30 years <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> milk was less damaging to knocked out teeth than water or saliva. It was recommended {{because it has}} a compatible osmolality (fluid pressure) to tooth root cells and it is thought to be readily available. However, like physiologic saline, milk lacks the necessary metabolites and glucose necessary to maintain normal cell metabolism of the tooth root cells. The cells on knocked-out tooth roots in milk do not die immediately but are unable to replicate (mitosis) and so are less able to reform new cells when replanted.|$|E
25|$|Most {{streams of}} modern Judaism {{developed}} from the Pharisaic movement, which became known as Rabbinic Judaism (in Hebrew Yahadut Rabanit - יהדות רבנית) with the compilation of the Oral Torah into the Mishna.

25|$|This {{particular}} {{model used}} an Out of Africa migration 100,000 years ago, which separated Africans from non-Africans, {{followed by a}} single admixture event 30,000 years ago leading to the formulation of the European population. The admixture event consisted of a source population that was 35% African and 65% East Asian. However, the study notes that a more realistic scenario would include several admixture events occurring over a sustained period. In particular, they cite the spread of farming from a source population in West Asia 5000–9000 years <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> {{may have played a}} role in the genetic relatedness of Africans and Europeans, since West Asia is sandwiched in between Africa and Central Asia.|$|E
25|$|The Alpine orogeny was {{the main}} cause of {{extensive}} tectonic activities and it was responsible for the formation of the hydrothermal field within the region. The Chaves graben was formed by the relative motion of the block with different types of sediments being settled. The most recent formations are a sedimentary series (lacustrine, alluvial, colluvial, detritic, etc.) with variable thickness that had their origin during the Miocene. Two main faults cross and influence the tectonic activities: the north-northeast by south-southeast Chaves-Verin Fault and a fault system crossing near Faiões and Santo Estêvão. The first fault developed from late Hercynian tectonic episode occurring between 280 and 300 million years <b>ago,</b> <b>that</b> developed into an almost north-south direction into the lithosphere. Intense neotectonic activity reactivated these old fractures, originating in a complex pattern of faults in the sedimentary basin.|$|E
25|$|Improved {{nutrition}} {{is another}} possible explanation. Today's average adult from an industrialized nation is taller than a comparable adult {{of a century}} <b>ago.</b> <b>That</b> increase of stature, likely the result of general improvements of nutrition and health, has been {{at a rate of}} more than a centimeter per decade. Available data suggest that these gains have been accompanied by analogous increases of head size, and by an increase in the average size of the brain. This argument had been thought to suffer the difficulty that groups who tend to be of smaller overall body size (e.g. women, or people of Asian ancestry) do not have lower average IQs. Richard Lynn, however, claims that while people of East Asian origin may often have smaller bodies, they tend to have larger brains and higher IQs than average whites.|$|E
