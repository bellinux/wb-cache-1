5|$|The Cascade Range is {{dramatically}} different in climate from west to east. The west side is heavily forested and features trees such as Douglas firs, western hemlock, Pacific silver firs, <b>and</b> <b>Alaska</b> yellow cedars. East of the Cascades, where Yamsay lies, the climate becomes much drier, even arid. Precipitation significantly declines and vegetation becomes more sparse, with lodgepole pine, white fir, ponderosa pine, and juniper. To the south, chaparral {{plants such as}} beargrass and bitterbrush prevail.|$|E
5|$|The main {{tension between}} {{fisheries}} {{science and the}} fishing industry {{is that the two}} groups have different views on the resiliency of fisheries to intensive fishing. In places such as Scotland, Newfoundland, <b>and</b> <b>Alaska</b> the fishing industry is a major employer, so governments are predisposed to support it. On the other hand, scientists and conservationists push for stringent protection, warning that many stocks could be wiped out within fifty years.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} found in {{northern}} temperate and boreal climates, penetrating sometimes into subarctic regions. It has been recorded from North Africa, northern Asia, Europe, and is common in North America, where it sometimes grows with aspen (Populus species). The North American distribution extends north into the Yukon <b>and</b> <b>Alaska</b> and south to Mexico.|$|E

5|$|This {{species is}} {{northern}} and alpine in distribution, and rarely encountered. Collections {{have been made}} in the United States (including Maine, Oregon, Colorado, New Mexico, <b>and</b> <b>Alaska),</b> Canada (Quebec and British Columbia), China, Japan, and Korea. The disjunct distribution of this species in North America and East Asia has been noted to occur in a number of other fungal species as well. Polyozellus multiplex is also found in the Queen Charlotte Islands, where it is commercially harvested.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Okinawa in July, Guam {{was assigned to}} Cruiser Task Force 95, where she served as the flagship, along with her sister Alaska, {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Francis S. Low. On 16 July, Guam <b>and</b> <b>Alaska</b> conducted a sweep into the East China and Yellow Seas to sink Japanese shipping. They had only limited success, however, and returned to the fleet on 23 July. They then joined a major raid, which included three battleships and three escort carriers, into the estuary of the Yangtze River off Shanghai. Again, the operation met with limited success, and they returned to Okinawa by 7 August.|$|E
5|$|After two failed attempts, {{about 60}} common {{starlings}} were released in 1890 into New York's Central Park by Eugene Schieffelin. He {{was president of}} the American Acclimatization Society, which tried to introduce every bird species mentioned in the works of William Shakespeare into North America. About the same date, the Portland Song Bird Club released 35 pairs of common starlings in Portland, Oregon. These birds became established but disappeared around 1902. Common starlings reappeared in the Pacific Northwest in the mid-1940s and these birds were probably descendants of the 1890 Central Park introduction. The original 60 birds have since swelled in number to 150 million, occupying an area extending from southern Canada <b>and</b> <b>Alaska</b> to Central America.|$|E
