50|$|CIDR is principally a bitwise, prefix-based {{standard}} for the representation of IP addresses and their routing properties. It facilitates routing by allowing blocks of addresses to be grouped into single routing table entries. These groups, commonly called CIDR blocks, share an initial sequence of bits in the binary representation of their IP addresses. IPv4 CIDR blocks are identified using a syntax {{similar to that of}} IPv4 addresses: a dotted-decimal address, followed by a slash, then a number from 0 to 32, i.e., a.b.c.d/n. The dotted decimal portion is the IPv4 address. The number following the slash is the prefix size, the number of shared initial bits, counting from the most-significant bit of the address. When emphasizing only the size of a network, the <b>address</b> <b>portion</b> of the notation is usually omitted. Thus, a /20 block is a CIDR block with an unspecified 20-bit prefix.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Wire-speed IP (Internet Protocol) routers require {{very fast}} routing table lookup for {{incoming}} IP packets. The routing table lookup operation is time consuming because {{the part of}} an IP address used in the lookup, i. e., the network <b>address</b> <b>portion,</b> is variable in length. This paper describes the routing table lookup algorithm used in a cluster-based parallel IP router project called Suez. The innovative aspect of this algorithm {{is its ability to}} use CPU caching hardware to perform routing table caching and lookup directly by carefully mapping IP addresses to virtual addresses. By running a detailed simulation model that incorporates the performance effects of the CPU memory hierarchy against a packet trace collected from a major network router, we show that the overall performance of the proposed algorithm can reach 87. 87 million lookups per second for a 500 -MHz Alpha processor with a 16 -KByte L 1 cache and a 1 -MByte L 2 cache. This result is one to two orders of magnitude faster than previously reported results on software-based routing table lookup implementations. This paper also reports the performance impacts of various architectural parameters in the proposed scheme and its storage costs, together with the measurements of an implementation of the proposed scheme on a Pentium-II machine running Linux.

For example, because USDA regulations restrict the amounts of meats and grains that can be served in school lunches each week, all eight districts GAO visited needed to modify or eliminate popular menu items. These changes sometimes led to negative student reactions. The meat and grain restrictions also led to smaller lunch entrees, making it difficult for some schools to meet minimum calorie requirements for lunches without adding items, such as gelatin, that generally do not improve the nutritional quality of lunches. In response to feedback from states and districts regarding operational challenges caused by the meat and grain restrictions, USDA lifted the limits temporarily, first for the remainder of school year 2012 - 2013 and then for school year 2013 - 2014. USDA officials said they did not see a problem making the temporary changes to help with implementation because the limits on meats and grains and the limits on the calories in lunches are somewhat redundant, as both <b>address</b> <b>portion</b> size. However, because the change was seen as temporary, the eight districts GAO visited made only marginal changes to their menus.
