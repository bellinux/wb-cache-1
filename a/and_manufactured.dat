The first known french fry vending machine was developed circa 1982 by the defunct Precision Fry Foods Pty Ltd. in Australia. A few companies have developed <b>and</b> <b>manufactured</b> French fry vending machines and prototypes. Furthermore, a prototype machine was also developed at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|The FN P90, {{also known}} as the FN Project 1990, is a {{personal}} defense weapon (PDW) designed <b>and</b> <b>manufactured</b> by FN Herstal in Belgium.

Derived from the Lavochkin La-150, the 152 used several different engines, but the program was canceled as other fighters with more powerful engines and swept wings showed more promise.|$|E
5|$|The Nationalist and Popular armies also {{designed}} <b>and</b> <b>manufactured</b> {{a number of}} their own tanks. The Nationalists, for example, began the war with three Trubia A4 prototypes, manufactured {{before the beginning of}} the conflict. They also completed the first prototype of the Verdeja light tank. This was designed to overcome the shortcomings of tanks provided by the Germans and the Italians, as well as Soviet tanks captured from the Popular Front. Popular Front production of armored vehicles was segmented throughout different areas of Spain. In the north, between 15 and 20 Carro Trubia-Naval tanks were manufactured at the factory in Sestao, conversely the Trubia factory had built only a single model Landesa tank. In Catalonia, two tanks were produced by the Maquinaría Moderna factory in Sant Sadurní d'Anoia. Though the Popular Front designed <b>and</b> <b>manufactured</b> many more armored fighting vehicles than the Nationalists, this ultimately worked in the Nationalists favor as the factories and their production lines were captured intact during the war.|$|E

5|$|Apple {{approached}} Sony in late 1989 {{because it}} did not have enough engineers to handle the number of new products that were planned for delivery in 1991. Using a basic blueprint from Apple, including a list of chips and other components, and the Portable's architecture, the 100 was miniaturized <b>and</b> <b>manufactured</b> by Sony in San Diego, California, and Japan. Sony engineers had little experience building personal computers but nonetheless completed Apple's smallest and lightest machine in under 13months, cancelling other projects and giving the PowerBook100 top priority. Sony president Norio Ohga gave project manager Kihey Yamamoto permission to recruit engineers from any Sony division.|$|E

5|$|Category4 hurricanes tend {{to produce}} more {{extensive}} curtainwall failures, with some complete structural failure on small residences. Heavy, irreparable damage and near complete destruction of gas station canopies and other wide span overhang type structures are common. Mobile <b>and</b> <b>manufactured</b> homes are often flattened. Most trees, except for the heartiest, are uprooted or snapped, isolating many areas. These storms cause extensive beach erosion, while terrain may be flooded far inland. Total and long-lived electrical and water losses are to be expected, possibly for many weeks.|$|E

The aircraft was used mainly by wealthy passengers who could afford to pay a high price in exchange for Concorde's speed and luxury service.

The 1982 Logger arcade game from Century Electronics is a direct clone of Donkey Kong, with a large bird standing in for the ape and rolling logs instead of barrels.|$|E

In {{order to}} solve the problem that the design <b>and</b> <b>manufacture</b> method for letters product in {{traditional}} ways has a long period and high cost, a new design <b>and</b> <b>manufacture</b> method based on RP technology was proposed. Firstly, Rhinoceros software was used to design the initial model, and then the initial model was put into SolidWorks software for model processing. After that, the established model was put into RPdata software for data processing. Finally, by using RP 450 B rapid prototyping machine, a rapid prototype of the model was achieved. Through the study, some key problems such as model design, processing of model data and manufacturing process were discussed. The new design <b>and</b> <b>manufacture</b> method has greatly shortened the design <b>and</b> <b>manufacture</b> cycle of the letters product, and it provides the reference for the design <b>and</b> <b>manufacture</b> for other art works...|$|R
