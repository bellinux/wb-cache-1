50|$|For the {{increasingly}} uncommon <b>analog</b> television <b>standard,</b> the audio for each TV channel is broadcast {{on a separate}} frequency band near the video signal frequency band (refer to article NTSC, Transmission modulation scheme).

50|$|The latest European efforts {{towards an}} <b>analog</b> <b>standard,</b> {{resulting}} in MAC systems, still used the sequential colour transmission idea of SECAM, {{with only one}} of time-compressed U and V components being transmitted on a given line. The D2-MAC standard enjoyed some short real market deployment, particularly in northern European countries. To some extent, this idea is still present in 4:2:0 digital sampling format, which is used by most digital video medias available to the public. In this case, however, colour resolution is halved in both horizontal and vertical directions thus yielding a more symmetrical behavior.|$|E
50|$|The (mostly) North American Advanced Television Systems Committee {{standards}} for digital television uses {{a form of}} PAM to broadcast the data that makes up the television signal. This system, known as 8VSB, {{is based on a}} three-level PAM like 100BASE-TX, but uses additional processing to suppress one sideband and thus make more efficient use of limited bandwidth. Using a single 6 MHz channel allocation, as defined in the previous NTSC <b>analog</b> <b>standard,</b> 8VSB is capable of transmitting 32 Mbit/s. After accounting for error correcting codes and other overhead, the data rate in the signal is 19.39 Mbit/s.|$|E
50|$|All digital-to-analog {{converter}} boxes have both an antenna input (which accepts the coaxial cable that formerly {{went directly to}} the TV) and an RF output (which now goes directly to the TV). They may also have additional outputs. Any converter box converts the digital signal for the current digital sub-channel to an analog signal (at the reduced screen resolution of the <b>analog</b> <b>standard),</b> outputs that signal onto analog channel 3 or 4 (set by the user to avoid any conflict with local over-the-air channels) and sends that signal to the analog tuner in the TV. With a box that lacks analog passthrough, no other signals are sent to the output, so all analog stations are lost.|$|E
50|$|In digital {{television}} and video, which are replacing their <b>analog</b> predecessors, single <b>standards</b> that can accommodate {{a wider range}} of frame rates still show the limits of <b>analog</b> regional <b>standards.</b> The ATSC standard, for example, allows frame rates of 23.976, 24, 29.97, 30, 59.94, and 60 frames per second, but not 25 and 50.|$|R

50|$|FM {{modulation}} of {{the color}} information allows SECAM to be completely free of the dot crawl problem commonly encountered with the other <b>analog</b> <b>standards.</b> SECAM transmissions are more robust over longer distances than NTSC or PAL. However, owing to their FM nature, the color signal remains present, although at reduced amplitude, even in monochrome portions of the image, thus being subject to stronger cross color even though color crawl of the PAL type doesn't exist.|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{discontinued}} Hughes Electronics DirectTV DVR with TiVo model HR10-250, all newer TiVo {{units have}} been fully HDTV capable.

Unlike the HR10-250, neither the Series3 nor Series4 units can record from the DirecTV service; conversely, the HR10-250 cannot record from digital cable. Other TiVo models may be connected to a high definition television (HDTV), but are not capable of recording HDTV signals, although they may be connected to a cable HDTV set-top box and record the down-converted outputs.|$|E
50|$|While the United Kingdom {{has chosen}} the Eureka 147 {{standard}} of {{digital audio broadcasting}} (DAB) for creating a digital radio service, the United States has selected IBOC technology for its digital AM and FM stations. The band used for terrestrial DAB in the UK is part of VHF band III, which does not suffer from L-band's significant line-of-sight problems. However, it is not available in North America since that span is occupied by TV channels 7 to 13 and the amateur radio 1.25 meter (222 MHz) band. The stations currently occupying that spectrum {{did not wish to}} give up their space, since VHF offers several benefits over UHF: relatively lower power, long distance propagation (up to 100 miles (160 km) with a rooftop antenna), and a longer wavelength that is more robust and less affected by interference. In Canada, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) is continuing to follow the <b>analog</b> <b>standard,</b> so the channels remain unavailable there as well. HD Radio testing has been authorized in Canada, as well as other countries around the world.|$|E
50|$|On March 1, 2017, reports {{surfaced}} that Sinclair Broadcast Group was {{in discussions}} to acquire Chicago-based Tribune Media, which {{was approached by}} Sinclair management about a possible merger in late February. Any deal would occur pending FCC review of the UHF discount, which had been eliminated in a 3-2 vote led by former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler in September 2016, on grounds of 1985's rule obsolescence as UHF stations transmitting over the ATSC digital format have improved signal reception compared to those which broadcast over the NTSC <b>analog</b> <b>standard.</b> Such a deal would compliment Sinclair, as it only has an 11% market overlap with Tribune and requires minimum divestment; additionally, Sinclair would expand its reach within the top-10 markets - adding stations in markets such as New York City (WPIX, which would displace WJLA-TV as its largest station by market size), Los Angeles (KTLA), Chicago (WGN-TV), Philadelphia (WPHL-TV) and Dallas (KDAF) - as well as gain a station in Cleveland, which would give the company at least one television station in every Ohio market (except Youngstown, Lima and Marietta. In addition, such a deal would also give Sinclair a national cable presence in WGN America, and further expand Sinclair's multicasting and cable portfolio with the additions of Antenna TV, Chicago-based regional news channel Chicagoland Television, and partial interests in Food Network and This TV. Reports later stated that Sinclair was offering to buy Tribune at a per-share price in the high $30s.|$|E

50|$|Guidelines for {{collecting}} and preserving time-based media art are still evolving, and standards {{have not yet}} been reached. Generally though, video and film must be looked at differently because of {{the difference between the two}} mediums, despite having the similarity of being recorded in time. Thus procedures for preservation and conservation will vary between the mediums. Video is a coded system, the information stored on the magnetic or digital tape can be retrieved only with a specific electronic playback device; the images on the film strip, however, are legible on their own, though the projector provides the only means by which they can be viewed. When collecting film and video art, a master and at least one sub-master should be obtained. In some cases, and exhibition copy will be obtained as well, in other cases it will be copied by the museum. The Guggenheim Museum provides preservation models for <b>Analog</b> <b>Standard</b> Definition Video, Digital Standard Definition Video, and High Definition Video. Some conservators recommend that sub-masters be in digital format, as analog tape suffers from generation loss, each time it is duplicated. Digital formats can suffer from generation loss as well, but it can be avoided through good practice. The sub-master will be used to make new copies of the work and the format of the sub-master needs to be updated when it nears obsolescence. Obsolescence is of particular concern to time-based media art conservationists as many artworks are tied to hardware which is no longer manufactured or supported. File formats reaching obsolescence are another concern, as operating systems change and old formats are replaced by newer ones. Fortunately there are some methods in place to help prevent the total loss of time-based media artworks.|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} savings in {{inventory}} costs from the standardization of two computer modular instrument interface standards: NIM, an <b>analog</b> <b>standard</b> and CAMAC, a digital standard, at US nuclear laboratory installations. The major {{benefit from the}} standardization effort springs {{from the fact that}} the modular instruments are interchangeable, providing opportunities for reducing inventory costs. To that effect, the safety stock levels of instrument modules required for computer system configurations were estimated by an iterative procedure derived from a continuous Markov chain process with a one-to-one replacement policy. Since on the average, there are only two instruments of the same type per CAMAC or NIM crate, the opportunities for reducing inventory costs are a function of the number of crates and thus appear present only in medium and large systems. Large amounts of benefits of $ 206 m (in 1981 dollars) were estimated from this successful standardization effort. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{synthesis}} {{system based}} on a circuit simulator and a silicon assembler for analog neural networks to be implemented in MOS technology is presented.

In this stage, the simulator has been combined with Madaline Rule III for approximating on chip training by software, thus minimizing the effects of circuit nonidealities on neural networks. The circuit simulator partitions the circuit into decoupled blocks which can be simulated separately, with the output of one block being the input for the next one. Finally, the silicon assembler generates the layout for the neural network by reading <b>analog</b> <b>standard</b> cells from a library. The system' [...] ...|$|E
