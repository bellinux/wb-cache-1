5|$|The {{construction}} of the dyke suggests that it was built to create an effective barrier and to command views into Wales. This implies that the Mercians who built it were free to choose the best location for the dyke. There are settlements {{to the west of}} the dyke that have names that imply they were English by the 8th century, so it may be that in choosing the location of the barrier the Mercians were consciously surrendering some territory to the native Britons. Alternatively it may be that these settlements had already been retaken by the Welsh, implying a defensive role for the barrier. The effort and expense that must have gone into building the dyke <b>are</b> <b>impressive,</b> and suggest that the king who had it built (whether Offa or someone else) had considerable resources at his disposal. Other substantial construction projects of a similar date do exist, however, such as Wat's Dyke and Danevirke, in what is now Germany as well as such sites as Stonehenge from millennia earlier. The dyke can be regarded in the light of these counterparts as the largest and most recent great {{construction of}} the preliterate inhabitants of Britain.|$|E
5|$|While all the cathedrals <b>are</b> <b>impressive,</b> some, {{because of}} their location, are highly {{significant}} landmarks and landscape elements. Among these is Chichester, which can be seen for many miles across a landscape of open fields {{and is the only}} one of England’s cathedrals that is visible from the sea. The grey spire of Norwich rises serenely from its surrounding city, to be a focus of the Norwich School of landscape painters. Ely, on a small hill, dominates the rural countryside and its appearance in times of flood causes it to be known as The Ship of the Fens. The three spires of Lichfield are known as The Ladies of the Vale. The “exquisite tower” of Worcester is seen best across the River Severn. Lincoln with its vast façade and three towers, the tallest being over 80 metres (270ft), rises majestically from a steep hill above the town. Salisbury Cathedral with its “faultless spire” constitutes one of the iconic views of England, made famous by the landscape painter John Constable. In the north of England, Durham makes a “spectacular” view as it sits dramatically on its steep rocky peninsula above the River Wear, “half Church of God, half castle ‘gainst the Scots”.|$|E
25|$|Although the basaltic {{columns of}} the Giant's Causeway <b>are</b> <b>impressive,</b> {{they are not}} unique. Basalt columns are a common {{volcanic}} feature, and they occur on many scales (because faster cooling produces smaller columns).|$|E
5000|$|The Murke of {{the title}} is a {{psychology}} graduate whose first job is as editor for the Cultural Department at Broadcasting House.

[...] He takes a little card his mother has sent him, {{with a picture of}} the Sacred Heart and [...] "I prayed for you at St. James's Church," [...] and sticks it up in one of the corridors behind an assistant producer's door frame.|$|R

This iconography is most present on the Gateway of the Sun.|$|E

25|$|As with Dennis Brookes, it is {{impossible}} to evaluate Brian Reynolds' contribution to Northamptonshire solely in terms of his performances for the first team. They <b>are</b> <b>impressive</b> enough, but all the runs and catches, the twenty stumpings as stand-in wicket-keeper and overlook these at you peril, the four wickets., must be supplemented with thirteen seasons' work as Chief Coach in charge of the Second XI, and a further eleven years in the specially-created role of Cricket development Officer.|$|E
25|$|Normanby is {{the name}} of the {{northern}} end of North East Valley, at which point Dunedin's urban area gives way to open countryside. The land here is steeply sloping, as it is the foothills of Mount Cargill. The slopes of Mount Cargill itself are densely wooded, and are crisscrossed with walking tracks, some of which start at the Bethune's Gully reserve, at the northern end of Normanby. Chingford Park, at the Normanby end of the valley is now a sports field and recreational reserve, but was originally the residence of one of Sam Neill's forebears, who was founder of Dunedin Company Wilson Neill. The large house is now gone, but the stone stables still on the site <b>are</b> <b>impressive.</b>|$|E

25|$|Kwaito is a {{political}} and party-driven genre, as performers use the music to express their political views, and also to express their desire {{to have a good}} time. Kwaito is a music that came from a once hated and oppressed people, but it is now sweeping the nation. The main consumers of Kwaito are adolescents and half of the South African population is under 21. Some of the large Kwaito artists have sold more than 100,000 albums, and in an industry where 25,000 albums sold is considered a gold record, those <b>are</b> <b>impressive</b> numbers. Kwaito allows the participation and creative engagement of otherwise socially excluded peoples in the generation of popular media. South African hip hop is more diverse lately and there are hip hop acts in South Africa that have made an impact and continue making impact worldwide. These include Tumi, Ben Sharpa, HipHop Pantsula, Tuks Senganga.|$|E

Comparing the groups in 1986, the Los Angeles Times reported: [...] "Though Whodini's record sales <b>are</b> <b>impressive,</b> Run-D.M.C. has been a greater media attraction and a bigger critical favorite." [...] Escape was re-released on compact disc in 2011 by the Traffic Group with several bonus tracks.|$|E

500|$|The {{television}} show was noted {{as a part}} of the mid-2000s films, television, and books that drove a resurgence of the public popularity of magic. Criss Angel Mindfreak was the first weekly magic {{television show}} to air in forty years. Daily Variety reviewed the premiere writing, [...] "The stunts alone <b>are</b> <b>impressive.</b> But what makes the show fascinating are the down-home touches in which we see the kid from New York, who first honed his magic skills at the age of 6. Keenly aware of the camera at all times, Angel manages to offer some personality, especially where family is involved. Viewers follow the illusionist as he contemplates new and more dangerous stunts, while his crew, including his often-fretful brothers, offer insight as to what, other than ego, drives someone in this profession." ...|$|E

500|$|Boyd van Hoeij of Variety {{magazine}} was more critical, writing [...] "Though {{a lot of}} it is well written and directed and, quite often, funny or poignant, the individual scenes rarely become part of a larger whole." [...] He praises Leto's acting, stating [...] "The closest the film comes to having a gravitational center are in the scenes set in 2092. What makes them soar is not the imaginative staging of the future, but Leto's performance. His acting talent really comes into full view in his scenes as the last dying man on Earth." [...] He also praised Regbo and Temple, saying [...] "Regbo, as the teenage Nemo, and Juno Temple, as the teenage Anna, <b>are</b> <b>impressive,</b> bringing the hormonal battles of adolescence vividly to life." [...] Film critic Eric Lavallée listed Regbo as one of his [...] "Top 10 New Faces & Voices" [...] of 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. He notes that [...] "newbie Toby Regbo might easily be Mr. Nobody's most [...] "alive" [...] character. Playing Nemo at age 16, the actor is mostly paired with Juno Temple – their unique love story is the film's heart pumping portions and plays a lot better than the artery clogging other brushes of romance." ...|$|E
