Robert Christgau awarded the album a C+ rating, giving the album a derisory review, while Janet Maslin defended it in Rolling Stone, writing: [...] "These latest live versions of his old songs {{have the effect of}} liberating Bob Dylan from the originals." [...] When Dylan brought the tour to the U.S. in September 1978, the press described the look and sound as a 'Las Vegas Tour'.

2500|$|The Sandinistas' {{relationship}} with the Roman Catholic Church deteriorated as the Contra War continued. The hierarchy refused {{to speak out against}} the counterrevolutionary activities of the contras and failed to denounce American military aid.

According to former President Ortega, [...] "The conflict with the church was strong, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>costs</b> us, but I don't think it was our fault. ... There were so many people being wounded every day, so many people dying, and it was hard for us to understand the position of the church hierarchy in refusing to condemn the contras." [...] The hierarchy-state tensions were brought to the fore with Pope John Paul II 1983 visit to Nicaragua. Hostility to the Catholic Church became so great that at one point, FSLN militants shouted down Pope John Paul II as he tried to say Mass.
