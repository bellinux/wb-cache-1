5|$|Nettlecombe Court {{has several}} emblems and carvings bearing {{the image of}} a horse rising from the sea, which are the Trevilian family arms, found {{throughout}} the house. The source story of the arms is the Lyonesse legend of Trevilian, as follows: Lyonesse were the lands, now submerged, on the west coast that was said to be the lands of Camelot of King Arthur and the site of the final mortal battle between King Arthur and Mordred. Tennyson's Idylls of the King claims Lyonesse as the final resting place of King Arthur himself. Perhaps this is why the grave of the king cannot be found, as it lies beneath the sea. Roman writings also speak of a Leonis, now submerged off the coast. Lyonesse was also the home of Tristan and Isolde. Legend relates that when Lyonesse suddenly sank, it was inundated as sea levels rushed in. The sole surviving knight of King Arthur's Lyonesse was said to be only one knight, Trevilian, who escaped by riding his white horse through the rising waters to higher ground before Lyonesse was submerged. Trevilian urged the other knights to join him in his attempt to escape, who counter-urged Trevilian to stay put and wait for the floodwaters to pass. The sedentary knights jovially bet wagers amongst themselves around the supper table, {{as to whether or not}} Trevilian and his white horse could survive swimming through the incoming flooding and make it to higher ground. None of the other Arthurian knights of Lyonesse, except Trevilian, was said to have survived the great sinking and inundation of Lyonesse. Submerged Medieval church bells of the lost land of Lyonesse were later said to be heard ringing, muffled under the water, when turbulent storms created rough seas. The surviving Trevilian became the founder of the current British Trevilian-Trevelyan family, whose coat of arms still bears a white horse issuing forth from the sea. In some cases the Trevilian white horse arms may be seen combined at Nettlecombe with other related family arms, indicating marriages to Raleigh, Luttrell, Wyndham, Chichester <b>and</b> <b>Strode.</b>|$|E

40|$|Running {{speed is}} {{determined}} by <b>stride</b> frequency <b>and</b> <b>stride</b> length. As running speed is adjusted, runners make greater adjustments in stride length at slower speeds with a shift to stride frequency adjustments at the faster speeds. The relationship between <b>stride</b> frequency <b>and</b> <b>stride</b> length is largely based on overground research {{which leads to the}} purpose of this study to analyze whether the connection of <b>stride</b> frequency <b>and</b> <b>stride</b> length will adjust similar due to changes in running velocity during overground and treadmill running. The protocol was recently approved by The Institutional Review Board and data collection is currently in progress; - thus the following present abstract does not contain data. In order to compare runner’s gait pattern responses to velocity changes, two wearable technologies (Garmin Fenix 2, Garmin, Kansas, USA; runScribe, Scribe Lab, San Francisco, USA) designed to measure <b>stride</b> length <b>and</b> <b>stride</b> frequency will be utilized. Subjects will run at a variety of velocities overground and then on the treadmill with speeds ranging from slow, preferred, and fast. The main dependent variables will be <b>stride</b> frequency <b>and</b> <b>stride</b> length. The null hypothesis is: The relationship between <b>stride</b> length <b>and</b> <b>stride</b> frequency is similar while running overground and on a treadmill at different velocities. The results of this study will be helpful to runners as well as development of wearable technology used to quantify run metrics...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{statistical}} persistence in stride intervals characteristics exist during walking, running and cycling and were speed-dependent among healthy young adults. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if such statistical persistence in stride time interval, <b>stride</b> length <b>and</b> <b>stride</b> speed also exists during self-paced continuous stairmill climbing and if the strength is dependent on stepping rate. Stride time, <b>stride</b> length, <b>and</b> <b>stride</b> speed were collected from nine healthy participants during 3 min of stairmill climbing at 100, 110, and 120 % of their preferred stepping rate (PSR) and 5 min of treadmill walking at preferred walking speed (PWS). The amount of variability (assessed by standard deviation and coefficient of variation) and dynamics (assessed by detrended fluctuation analysis and sample entropy) of the stride time, <b>stride</b> length, <b>and</b> <b>stride</b> speed time series were investigated. The amounts of variability were significantly higher during stairmill climbing for the stride time, <b>stride</b> length, <b>and</b> <b>stride</b> speed <b>and</b> did only change with increased stepping rate for stride speed. In addition to a more irregular pattern during stairmill climbing, the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) revealed that the stride length fluctuations were statistical anti-persistent for all subjects. On a group level both <b>stride</b> time <b>and</b> <b>stride</b> speed fluctuations were characterized by an uncorrelated pattern which was more irregular compared to that during treadmill walking. However, large inter-participant differences were observed for these two variables. In addition, the dynamics did not change with increase in stepping rate...|$|R

40|$|This study {{recorded}} basic gait {{data from}} 656 healthy primary school-aged children (5 - 13 years) and 81 young adults (18 - 27 years) whilst walking over-ground across a level walkway at varying speed. It investigated {{the effect of}} gait speed and re-examined the issue of gait maturation. Participants completed 6 - 8 walks at self-selected slow, free and fast speed along a GAITRite walkway whilst wearing athletic shoes. Outcome measures (non-normalized and normalized) were gait speed, cadence, step <b>and</b> <b>stride</b> length, step <b>and</b> <b>stride</b> time, support base, single and double support (%), stance duration (%), foot angle and associated symmetry measures. Compared to free speed, participants walked 24 % slower for the slow speed and 30 % faster for the fast speed (. p< 0. 0001). Both normalized and non-normalized measures of cadence, step <b>and</b> <b>stride</b> length increased with speed (. p< 0. 001) whereas step <b>and</b> <b>stride</b> time reduced (. p< 0. 001). As {{a percentage of the}} gait cycle, single support and stance duration increased with speed (. p< 0. 001) whereas double support reduced (. p< 0. 001). Foot angle was significantly less (less toe-out) for the fast speed than the free and slow speeds (. p< 0. 001) whereas support base was unaffected by speed. Symmetry measures were unaffected by age or speed. Step <b>and</b> <b>stride</b> symmetry differentials (combining conditions) fell around 0. 8. cm, whereas symmetry differentials for step and stance time, single and double support fell around 0. 7 %. This information can be used by clinicians and researchers to assess the gait of children...|$|R
