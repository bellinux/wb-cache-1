5|$|Gilly {{was later}} seen using his new look {{in attempt to}} get the {{affections}} of Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson). After failing he acted out of character and struck up a scam date with Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) to make Steph jealous but it back-fired when his false tooth came loose in Cheryl's mouth. He later has relationships with Cheryl and Jem Costello (Helen Russell-Clark). Another change implemented during this period was a dramatic change to the character's appearance after new series producer Lucy Allan and Quinlan came to a mutual decision to transform his hairstyle by shaving it <b>all</b> <b>off,</b> a stark contrast as during his early years he was constantly seen with long hair.|$|E
5|$|In the Fourth Victory Test, {{again at}} Lord's, Miller {{came in at}} 3/108 and after a slow start, scored another century, taking 170 minutes to reach the mark before being removed for 118. He struck ten fours, <b>all</b> <b>off</b> which were driven. In the second innings, {{he came to the}} crease with four wickets down with Australia still in arrears. He scored an unbeaten 35 to ensure that Australia would not {{collapse}} further and lose the match. The public reception towards the Victory Tests resulted in an additional fifth match being added to the schedule. To warm up for that match, Miller took 3/95 against the North of England.|$|E
5|$|This {{concept of}} the double burden with married couples is a {{worldwide}} phenomenon. Throughout different cultures of the world, women spend more total hours in work than men do. In Japan, once married, they are still expected to be devoted wives and mothers who give <b>all</b> <b>off</b> their effort to the home, even after {{a full day of}} work. Latin American women, now entering the work force in large numbers, still face what they call doble jornada, or double day's journey. Although in the Latin American culture, men are starting to interact more with the children and helping around the house more, the main domestic responsibilities still fall upon the women of the house. Sometimes women who are primary wage earners are still relegated to most of the domestic work. European men are more likely to play and interact with their children but not likely to participate fully in their daily care. They are more likely to help their wives at home, yet rarely do they tackle all domestic task equally. Men commonly fail to live up to their belief of equal sharing of domestic labor: they may believe in an equal workload in the house, but the inconvenience of taking on work done by their wives stops many from following through.|$|E

25|$|In the Fourth Victory Test, {{again at}} Lord's, Hassett won the toss and elected to bat. Whitington scored 46 and Sismey 59. Miller {{came in at}} 3/108 and after a slow start, scored another century, taking 170 minutes to reach the mark. At {{the end of the}} first day, Australia were 5/273 with Miller and Pepper at the crease. Miller was removed for 118 the next day. He struck ten fours, <b>all</b> <b>off</b> which were driven. Pepper {{continued}} and made 57 to help Australia reach 388. Pope and Pollard took four wickets each.|$|E
25|$|Hurst, meanwhile, was {{routinely}} dormant in the league, but was {{the leading}} cup goalscorer in England (both FA Cup and League Cup) until his records were broken some 30 years later by Robbie Fowler. Originally a midfielder, Greenwood converted {{him to be a}} front-running striker and it paid dividends—he led the team to consecutive cup appearances before capping it <b>all</b> <b>off,</b> becoming a regular England international and FIFA World Cup winner in 1966. In the following season, he scored 41 goals in the league, nearly a quarter of his eventual tally.|$|E
25|$|A Faisalabad native, Naved {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut in March 1999, playing a single Quaid-i-Azam Trophy match against the Karachi Whites. Replacing Zahid Umar, the keeper {{for the two}} preceding matches, he made four and eleven runs while batting, and took three catches in the Karachi first innings, <b>all</b> <b>off</b> the bowling of Saadat Gul (who finished with 6/120). Naved's only other game for Faisalabad came in May 2001, against Gujranwala in the National One-Day Tournament. He scored 14 runs from 14 balls in that game, including a single six, and was the last man out in Faisalabad's innings of 185, which was overhauled by Gujranwala in 44.1 overs.|$|E

25|$|Boyce's fielding {{would play}} a {{similarly}} instrumental role for the Foxes in {{the final of the}} following year's Twenty20 competition on 27 August 2011, again at Edgbaston. Boyce had played in the Super Over victory over the Lancashire Lightning in the day's earlier semi-final, although he was not needed to bat. For the evening's final against Somerset, he was replaced in the Foxes' team by Jigar Naik. However, once again Jefferson had batted but was not able to take to the field, again due to an Achilles problem. This meant that Boyce would again appear as a substitute for Jefferson at Edgbaston. Boyce took the catches of James Hildreth, Peter Trego, Jos Buttler and Alfonso Thomas, <b>all</b> <b>off</b> the bowling of man of the match Josh Cobb, thus helping to steer the Foxes to a win by 18 runs and clinch the trophy.|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} a year serving the mandatory {{time in the}} military, Petrović followed his brother's footsteps and moved to Cibona to form, at that time, the best backcourt duo in Europe. The very first year in Cibona he won both the Yugoslav League championship and the Yugoslav National Cup. To top it <b>all</b> <b>off,</b> the 87–78 victory over the Spanish League club Real Madrid, to which Petrović contributed with 36 points, brought him and Cibona their first European Cup title. The second came the following year, as Petrović scored 22 points and Cibona defeated the USSR Premier League club Žalgiris Kaunas, which starred the legendary Arvydas Sabonis. The same year brought another Yugoslav national cup title for Cibona, seeing Petrović score 46 against the old rival Bosna. In 1987, Petrović earned his third European trophy: a 2nd-tier European Cup Winners' Cup title against the Italian League club Scavolini Pesaro, whose net he filled with 28 points.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on their}} few run-ins, Saša is {{sufficiently}} intrigued with Koka that he tracks {{her down and}} ends up sleeping with her in her apartment. Afterwards, he informs her that he doesn't want to pursue things further, which she takes in stride to his face, passing it <b>all</b> <b>off</b> as a light fling, but looks visibly shaken after he leaves. He decides to stay with Branka and is soon informed by her that she's pregnant so the parents quickly set about organizing a wedding. Meanwhile, Giga decides to call on his Pomoravlje paisano connections {{in order to find}} Saša a job. He wants to track down his old friend Jataganac who's now a powerful politically connected party-installed business manager. Though he manages to get Jataganac's attention after much wrangling, the whole thing eventually goes pear-shaped when Giga refuses to swallow his pride when Jataganac shows up four hours late to the dinner at Popadić's house.|$|E

He wrote, [...] "we've never disputed that she carries it <b>all</b> <b>off</b> in a fashion that's frank, fearless and unashamedly fun." [...] The song's chorus was highlighted in the review, with Copsey calling it [...] "her poppermost effort to date" [...] that contained [...] "bouncy Dr Luke beats and her usual bubblegum melodies".|$|E
500|$|Although the 1984 season had <b>all</b> <b>off</b> {{the makings}} of a memorable one for West Virginia, the Mountaineers {{experienced}} another letdown. [...] WVU started the season with a 7–1 record, posting an upset victory over No. 4 Boston College and its first victory over Penn State in 25 meetings along the way. [...] The Mountaineers were upset in each of their final three regular season games, however, losing to Virginia, Rutgers and Temple. WVU rebounded to defeat Texas Christian in the Bluebonnet Bowl, finishing the season at 8–4 with a No. 21 ranking in the final Coaches poll. [...] The Mountaineers also produced three All-Americans in return specialist Willie Drewrey, kicker Paul Woodside, and tight end Rob Bennett.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{video for}} [...] "Take It Off" [...] premiered on Vevo on August 3, 2010. [...] It {{was directed by}} Paul Hunter and Dori Oskowitz. Kesha revealed the main idea behind the video in an interview explaining that [...] " [...] about [...] and all [...] hot vampire babe friends breaking into a hotel on another planet, {{and at the end}} we all turn into this beautiful stardust. Once you take it <b>all</b> <b>off,</b> all your inhibitions, your clothes, we're all made up of the same thing." [...] She explained that she did not want the video to just be about [...] "Taking it off", that the message behind the video and the theme wasn't [...] "just about taking off your clothes and rolling in glitter. It's also about taking off your inhibitions and being raw and real".|$|E
500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "No Church in the Wild" [...] {{features}} a cinematic production style. Singers Frank Ocean and The-Dream lend their voices to the album's grim opener, which sets the mood with a gnarled guitar sample. Over the rock-centric, rolling production, both rappers muse over familiar themes of loyalty, sexuality and maternal solidarity. The pop-oriented [...] "Lift Off" [...] features baroque strings and a chorus sung by Beyoncé Knowles, accompanied with synthesizers. The song contains horns and martial drums as Knowles sings, [...] "We gon' {{take it to}} the moon/ Take it to the stars." [...] "Niggas in Paris" [...] incorporates staccato orchestration and fizzing industrial noise, topping it <b>all</b> <b>off</b> with a menacing beat and icy synthesizer notes. The track features an unusual sampling of dialogue from the 2007 film Blades of Glory, notably the [...] "we're gonna skate to one song and one song only" [...] line. West and Jay-Z's lyrics frame their rags to riches story on the song.|$|E
500|$|Following its {{premature}} release on the Web, the music video for [...] "You and I" [...] met with positive reviews. Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone felt the video was {{an improvement over}} her earlier videos, Judas and The Edge of Glory, saying, [...] "the best moments of the video put a distinctly Gaga-ish spin on the iconography of Americana and traditional love stories." [...] Jillian Mapes of Billboard wrote the video has: [...] "torture contraptions, mermaid sex, a wedding, bondage in a barn, an ice cream truck, and to top it <b>all</b> <b>off,</b> 'Children of the Corn' and religious overtones thrown in for good measure," [...] and thought [...] the video setting was the strangest representation of Nebraska. Leah Collins of Dose felt the video was a [...] "great opportunity for the singer to finally find out what it's like to make out with herself." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly noted of the scene in which Gaga plays a piano in a cornfield beside her male alter ego: [...] "She's just Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, playing a piano {{in the middle of}} a corn field—with a little making out on the side, of course." [...] Gil Kaufman of MTV News believed that Gaga was not joking when she talked about the video being about the [...] "torture" [...] of being away from the one you love. [...] "And, man, based on the bruising final product, she wasn't kidding," [...] Kaufman concluded.|$|E
