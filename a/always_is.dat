25|$|Hunters have meticulous turnout {{and tend}} toward very quiet, {{conservative}} horse tack and rider attire. Hunter bits, bridles, crops, spurs, and martingales are tightly regulated. Jumpers, while {{caring for their}} horses and grooming them well, are not scored on turnout, are allowed {{a wider range of}} equipment, and may wear less conservative attire, so long as it stays within the rules. Formal turnout <b>always</b> <b>is</b> preferred; a neat rider gives a good impression at shows.|$|E
25|$|By setting vn = 0, {{it can be}} seen {{immediately}} that (for positive φ and ω) a movement due east results in an acceleration due south. Similarly, setting ve = 0, it is seen that a movement due north results in an acceleration due east. In general, observed horizontally, looking along the direction of the movement causing the acceleration, the acceleration <b>always</b> <b>is</b> turned 90° to the right and of the same size regardless of the horizontal orientation.|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, though, it is {{most likely}} that the Homeric tradition contains elements of historical fact and elements of fiction interwoven. Homer describes a location, presumably in the Bronze Age, with a city. This city was near Mount Ida in northwest Turkey. Such a city did exist, at the mound of Hisarlık. Homer describes the location as very windy, which Hisarlık almost <b>always</b> <b>is,</b> and several other geographical features also match; so it appears, therefore, that Homer describes an actual place, although this fact does not in itself prove that his story is true.|$|E
25|$|The long fantasies form bridges {{between the}} limerent's {{ordinary}} {{life and that}} intensely desired ecstatic moment. The duration and complexity of a fantasy depend {{on the availability of}} time and freedom from distractions. The bliss of the imagined moment of consummation is greater when events imagined to precede it are possible (though they often represent grave departures from the probable). Not <b>always</b> <b>is</b> it entirely pleasant, and when rejection seems likely the thoughts focus on despair, sometimes to the point of suicide. The pleasantness or unpleasantness of the state seems almost unrelated to the intensity of the reaction. Although the direction of feeling, i.e. happy versus unhappy, shifts rapidly, with 'dramatic surges of buoyancy and despair', the intensity of intrusive and involuntary thinking alters less rapidly, and only in response to an accumulation of experiences with the particular limerent object.|$|E
25|$|The species {{subordinated to}} genus Scuticaria are {{characterized}} by being plants of thick cylindrical roots covered by thick vellamen. Their stem is formed by an ordinarily short rhizome, slightly elongated in some species; and by cylindrical almost inconspicuous pseudobulbs of the same diameter or slightly thicker than the unique leaf born on their apexes, because they generally are covered by small dried scaling steaths. The leaves may be erect or pending up to one meter long. The inflorescences grow from the said steaths and almost always bear just one flower, exceptionally two in one species, and <b>always</b> <b>is</b> much longer than the pseudobulbs, bearing showy yellow, orange, purple or greenish flowers, with petals and sepals plain, stained or striped, usually by light brown but also by diverse combinations and shades of the other mentioned colors. Ordinarily the labellum presents contrasting colors, frequently with white areas.|$|E

500|$|In 1918, Noether {{published}} a seminal {{paper on the}} inverse Galois problem. Instead of determining the Galois group of transformations of a given field and its extension, Noether asked whether, given a field and a group, it <b>always</b> <b>is</b> possible to find {{an extension of the}} field that has the given group as its Galois group. She reduced this to [...] "Noether's problem", which asks whether the fixed field of a subgroup G of the permutation group S'n acting on the field [...] <b>always</b> <b>is</b> a pure transcendental extension of the field k. (She first mentioned this problem in a 1913 paper, where she attributed the problem to her colleague Fischer.) She showed this was true for , 3, or 4. In 1969, R. G. Swan found a counter-example to Noether's problem, with [...] and G a cyclic group of order 47 (although this group can be realized as a Galois group over the rationals in other ways). The inverse Galois problem remains unsolved.|$|E
500|$|Love <b>Always</b> <b>is</b> {{written and}} {{performed}} in the R and soul styles. It consists of slow jams and love songs. The album's opening track, [...] "HBI", is a short introduction and is followed by [...] "Last Night's Letter", a slow jam about broken hearts. The next song, [...] "Baby Come Back", was written by K-Ci about his past relationship with singer Mary J. Blige. [...] "Love Ballad" [...] is a cover of the L.T.D. song.|$|E
500|$|The guild of the Arte di Calimala (importers, refinishers, {{and sellers}} of French and Transalpine cloth) {{annually}} imported 10,000 pieces of cloth worth 300,000 gold florins; these were {{sold on the}} streets of Florence, while a large but unknown amount was exported back out of Florence. There was a large flux of international traders entering Florence, so much so that Villani states all attempts at creating market fairs in the early 14th century failed because [...] "there <b>always</b> <b>is</b> a market in Florence." ...|$|E

500|$|The Ultimate Truth, {{states the}} text, {{is that which}} <b>always</b> <b>is,</b> which {{preserves}} its nature over time, and which is unaffected by anything. The Atman, the Brahman, the [...] "Chit, Sat and Ananda", and Janardhana (Vishnu) is such Truth, and they are synonymous, one. Some try to seek Sidhis, asserts the Upanishad, through mantras, religious rituals, time, skill, medicine, or wealth, but such Sidhis are fleeting and fruitless. Be an Atmajnani (one with Self-knowledge) through Yoga, says Vishnu to Ribhu, and to such a person Siddhis are of no importance.|$|E

Glaiel runs his own independent studio, Glaiel Games, and develops Flash games for game and animation website Newgrounds. The game's graphics and story were created by McMillen, while Glaiel wrote the game's music and code. The game was developed in 14 days; McMillen found he could [...] "ride off" [...] Glaiel's inspiration and allowed the project to be completed quickly. [...] "People being creative and taking risks with their work <b>always</b> <b>is</b> inspiring to me, honesty in art is also very inspiring," [...] he stated.|$|E
500|$|Vibe magazine's Michael Gonzalez {{gave the}} album a {{favorable}} review, writing, [...] "Love <b>Always</b> <b>is</b> a marvelous musical testament to black {{love in the}} '90s." [...] He enjoyed the production, especially from Rory Bennett, and compared the duo to Frankie Lymon. He noticed K-Ci's lyrics in [...] "Baby Come Back" [...] were {{about his relationship with}} Mary J. Blige stating [...] " [...] wails like a man driven crazy by his missteps." [...] Gonzalez also liked the songs [...] "Don't Rush (Take Love Slowly)", and [...] "You Bring Me Up".

500|$|Charlie Jane Anders of io9 {{believed}} that {{some elements of}} the film were deliberate self-references to Michael Bay's own sense of under-appreciation after the backlash to the second film: [...] "After {{a few hours of}} seeing Shia get dissed, overlooked and mistreated, the message becomes clear: Shia, as <b>always,</b> <b>is</b> a stand-in for Michael Bay. And Bay is showing us just {{what it felt like to}} deal with the ocean of Haterade—the snarking, the Razzie Award, the mean reviews—that Revenge of the Fallen unleashed." [...] She went on to say that the film's frequent, often jarring shifts in tone were an intentional endorsement of Michael Bay's own filmmaking style. [...] "Tone is for single-purpose machines. Consistency is for Decepticons. Michael Bay's ideal movie shifts from action movie to teen comedy to political drama with the same well-lubricated ease that his cars become men. By the time you've finished watching, you will speak Michael Bay's cinematic language." ...|$|E
500|$|On 3 January, Western journalists {{toured the}} deserted Ap Bac hamlet with American advisors. When {{reporter}} Neil Sheehan asked Brig. Gen. Robert York what had happened, the general replied: [...] "What the hell's {{it look like}} happened, boy? They got away, that's what happened"! Shortly afterwards, more than 18 hours too late, the South Vietnamese hit Ap Bac with an artillery barrage. The artillery rounds killed another five South Vietnamese soldiers and wounded 14 others. Vann, who had made key decisions in the early phases of the battle, blamed the South Vietnamese for the debacle. [...] "It was a miserable damn performance, just like it <b>always</b> <b>is.</b> These people won't listen. They {{make the same mistake}} {{over and over again in}} the same way". According to Moyar (2008), in blaming the South Vietnamese, Vann wanted to conceal the Americans' flawed intelligence and poor leadership. He hoped to pressure the South Vietnamese to accept future changes he favored.|$|E
500|$|... (Acheson) {{insisted on}} having, {{as a legal}} adviser, a lawyer whose ability as a lawyer and whose {{judgment}} in politics and statesmanship could be greatly respected. He got Adrian Fisher for that, and he involved him {{in all of the}} political and other activities that he himself was involved in. The Secretary of State <b>always</b> <b>is</b> involved in a lot of controversial things, and here we had the McCarthy era, the attack on the whole concept of Foreign Service and the State Department, and a terrific controversy over what to do about China, who had [...] "lost China." [...] Fisher was always at Acheson's right hand when he was dealing with other people about these things. Wherever he went, Fisher's office was backstopping him, getting all the necessary background information so he'd be prepared for any kind of question that came up. Of course, Acheson's own approach to being Secretary of State was such that when you took an agreement to him to be signed, his chief question was [...] "By what authority do I sign this?" [...] And whoever brought it to him to get it signed, had to be ready with the answer that would satisfy a lawyer -- [...] "by what legal authority" [...] -- as well as what it provides and so forth.|$|E
