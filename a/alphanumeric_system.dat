Alameda continued to serve with the Naval Overseas Transportation Service {{for the remainder of}} her naval career. In addition to operations between Port Arthur and ports on the U.S. east coast, she also made further voyages across the Atlantic Ocean to support U.S. Navy warships operating in European waters.|$|E
25|$|From 1859, the GCR {{identified}} {{different classes}} using an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>system.</b> The first {{list of classes}} was a simple list of numbers from 1 onward. Number 18 was the highest allocated. Thence, newly built classes received class numbers with a letter suffix rather than using more numbers. By 1923, the '9' series (the largest) had reached '9Q'. Of themselves the letters and numbers had no meaning; {{they appear to have}} been allocated randomly.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, {{the federal}} {{government}} assumed responsibility for funding the nations most important road links, {{with the introduction of}} the National Highway. These highways were marked with distinctive green and gold route marker shields instead of the plain National Route shield. Though the National Highway system has been superseded in subsequent legislation, National Highway route markers are still used on many of the routes. Additionally, National Highways and National Routes have been phased out, or {{are in the process of}} being phased out, in all states and territories except Western Australia, in favour of the <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the postal}} code systems are numeric; {{only a few}} are {{alphanumeric}} (i.e., use both letters and digits). <b>Alphanumeric</b> <b>systems</b> can, given {{the same number of}} characters, encode many more locations. For example, while a 2 digit numeric code can represent 100 locations, a 2 character alphanumeric code using ten numbers and twenty letters can represent 900 locations.|$|R
25|$|Roads {{routes in}} Australia assist drivers {{navigating}} roads throughout the country, by identifying important through-routes. The first route marking system {{was introduced to}} Australia in the 1950s. National Routes were assigned to significant interstate routes – the most important road links in the country. National Route 1 was designated to a circular route around the Australian coastline. A state route marking system was designed to supplement the national system, for inter-regional and urban routes within states. When the National Highway system was introduced, National Routes along it became National Highway routes with the same numbers, but with distinctive green and gold route markers. Alphanumeric routes were introduced in Tasmania in 1979, and during the 1990s, planning began for nationally consistent route markings, using the <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>system.</b> Alphanumeric routes have been introduced in most states and territories in Australia, partially or completely replacing the previous systems.|$|E
500|$|Departing Newport on 31 May, Bridgeport {{arrived at}} the Boston Navy Yard {{the next day and}} {{remained}} there through July, undergoing repairs and alterations. During this refit, on 17 July 1920, she received the designation AD-10 when the Navy adopted the <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>system</b> of hull classification and identification. Her battery underwent its third change when her [...] guns were upgraded from the 40-caliber to the 51-caliber model. Bridgeport remained in the yard until 20 August, when she returned to Newport. Back at New York {{at the end of the}} month, Bridgeport received orders to join in the rescue effort for submarine [...] that had sunk off the Delaware capes during post-overhaul trials. The destroyer tender left the anchorage off Tompkinsville late on 2 September and reached the scene late the following morning.
