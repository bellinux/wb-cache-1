40|$|AIMS: To {{analyze the}} serum lipid <b>and</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarker</b> {{profile in the}} early insulin {{resistance}} (e-IR). METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 5943 adults without diabetes, stratified into no IR group (C-peptide <third tertile and glucose < 100 mg/dL), e-IR group (C-peptide ≥third tertile and glucose < 100 mg/dL) and advanced IR group (glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL). RESULTS: E-IR showed significant differences with no IR in the serum concentration of triglycerides (P < 0. 001), HDL cholesterol (P < 0. 001), LDL cholesterol (P < 0. 001), sCD 40 L (P < 0. 001), C-reactive protein (P < 0. 004), leptin (P < 0. 001) and adiponectin (P < 0. 001). Adjusting for age, gender and abdominal obesity, corroborated the association of e-IR with highest quintile of triglycerides (OR 3. 88 [3. 07 - 4. 89]), HDL cholesterol (OR 0. 35 [0. 28 - 0. 44]), sCD 40 L (OR 0. 47 [0. 24 - 0. 94]), C-reactive protein (OR 2. 31 [1. 29 - 4. 12]), adiponectin (OR 0. 11 [0. 04 - 0. 32]), PAI- 1 (OR 3. 29 [1. 29 - 8. 40]) and resistin (OR 1. 25 [1. 01 - 1. 54]); the same biomarkers were associated with advanced IR although resistin was a protective factor (OR 0. 73 [0. 58 - 0. 93]).

Greater psychological stress and/or its timing was associated with significant differences in cognitive performance levels or change on a measure of spatial abilities (Block Design), perceptual speed abilities (Symbol Digit), verbal abilities (Synonyms), and episodic recognition memory (Thurstone Picture Memory).

A genetic risk score was calculated to assess the combined risk associated with all the genetic variants. A multiple linear regression model {{was used to assess}} associations between the genetic risk score, single SNPs, <b>and</b> the five <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers.</b> Results: The minor allele (G) (CAD risk allele) of rs 2075650 (TOMM 40 /APOE) was associated with lower levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (effect per risk allele: - 0. 37 mg/l [95 %CI - 0. 56 to - 0. 18 mg/l]).

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of pretreatment with atorvastatin (10  mg/kg) and quercetin (50  mg/kg), as well as their combination on isoprenaline-induced MI in rats. Markers chosen to assess cardiac damage included serum activity of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and serum level of cardiac troponin-I (cTn-I), as well as oxidative stress <b>and</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers</b> including serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) as well as cardiac contents of lipid peroxides, reduced glutathione (GSH), and nitrite. Furthermore, ECG monitoring and histological examinations of cardiac tissues were done. Isoprenaline increased serum CK-MB activity and cTn-I level as well as inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers. In addition, it produced ST-segment elevation and degenerative changes in heart tissues. Pretreatment with atorvastatin suppressed significantly the elevated levels of cTn-I, CRP, TNF-α, and IL- 10 in serum coupled with reduction in cardiac lipid peroxides; however, it increased cardiac nitrite content. Quercetin decreased isoprenaline-induced changes in oxidative stress <b>and</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers</b> with marked improvement in ECG and histopathologic alterations.

Therefore {{the aim of this}} study is investigating the effects of curcumin on levels of inflammation <b>and</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers</b> in arthritic rats. Arthritis was induced by subcutaneous injection of Freund’s complete adjuvant (0. 5 mL) into the right hind paw of Wistar male rats. Animals were divided into four groups (n= 8). GroupI acted as control, group II arthritic rats received vehicle, group III arthritic rats were treated with curcumin (30 mg/kg, orally) and another group arthritic rats were treated with indomethacin (3 mg/kg, orally) seven days after injection of Freund’s Complete Adjuvant for 15 days. The changes caused by chronic inflammation were evaluated by measurement of the ankle circumference three times per week. At the end of the experimental period, blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture to determine erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C. reactive protein levels and White blood cells count. An increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C. reactive protein concentrations, White blood cells count and ankle circumference was observed in arthritic rats compared with control rats (p< 0. 05).

We hypothesized that 1) detectable HIV/HCV RNA was independently associated with increased inflammation; 2) a composite inflammation measure describes inflammation differently from single <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers.</b> Methods We compared inflammation by HIV/HCV group in a cohort of 361 HIV infected participants from the HIV-Longitudinal Interrelationships of Viruses <b>and</b> Ethanol study. <b>Inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers</b> > 75 th percentile were considered elevated. Associations between HIV/HCV group and elevated biomarkers were analyzed as a composite measure (inflammatory burden) or individually. We defined inflammatory burden as number of concurrently elevated biomarkers. Biomarkers included interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), C-reactive protein (CRP), cystatin C, serum amyloid-A (SAA), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin- 10 (IL- 10). Covariates: alcohol, liver fibrosis, comorbidities, CD 4 count, antiretroviral therapy, substance use. Results Detectable HIV and HCV RNA (OR[*]=[*] 2. 49; 95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 05 – 5. 89) and detectable HCV RNA alone (2. 95; 1. 08 – 8. 01) were independently associated with increased odds of having a greater inflammatory burden compared to undetectable viremia. Elevated IL- 10 (7. 79; 1. 90 – 31. 97) and TNF-α (7. 70; 1. 42 – 41. 83) were independently associated with detectable HIV and HCV RNA. Elevated IL- 10 was also associated with detectable HCV RNA alone (5. 51; 1. 17, 25. 84). Conclusions Detectable HIV and HCV replication versus undetectable replication was associated with <b>inflammatory</b> burden <b>and</b> certain <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers</b> independently of alcohol consumption, liver fibrosis and other comorbidities...|$|R
40|$|Clinical and {{experimental}} {{evidence suggests that}} obesity-associated inflammation increases disease activity during colitis, attributed {{in part to the}} effects of Th 17 cells. Using a model of concurrent obesity and colitis, we monitored changes in critical immune cell subsets <b>and</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarker</b> expression in three key tissues: visceral adipose tissue, colon (local <b>inflammatory</b> site) <b>and</b> spleen (systemic <b>inflammatory</b> site), <b>and</b> we hypothesized that n- 3 PUFA would reduce the percentage of inflammatory immune cell subsets <b>and</b> suppress <b>inflammatory</b> gene expression, thereby improving the disease phenotype. Obesity was induced in C 57 BL/ 6 mice by feeding a high fat (HF) diet (59. 2 % kcal) alone or an isocaloric HF diet supplemented with fish oil (HF-FO) for 12 weeks. Colitis was induced via a 2. 5 % trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) enema. The HF-FO diet improved the obese phenotype by reducing i) serum hormone concentrations (leptin and resistin), ii) adipose tissue mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines (MCP- 1, IFNc, IL- 6, IL 17 F and IL- 21) and iii) total (F 4 / 80 + CD 11 b+) <b>and</b> <b>inflammatory</b> adipose tissue M 1 (F 4 / 80 + CD 11 c+) macrophage content compared to HF (P, 0. 05). In addition, the HF-FO diet reduced both colitis-associated disease severity and colonic mRNA expression of the Th 17 cell master transcription factor (RORct) and critical cytokines (IL- 6, IL- 17 A, IL- 17 F, IL- 21, IL- 23 and IFNc) versus HF (P, 0. 05).
