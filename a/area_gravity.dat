40|$|With the {{advances}} of measurements, modern space geodesy {{has become a}} new type of remote sensing for the Earth dynamics, especially for mass transports in the geophysical fluids on large spatial scales. A case in point is the space gravity mission GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment) which has been in orbit collecting gravity data since early 2002. The data promise to be able to detect changes of water mass equivalent to sub-cm thickness on spatial scale of several hundred km every month or so. China s Three-Gorge Reservoir has already started the process of water impoundment in phases. By 2009, 40 km 3 of water will be stored behind one of the world s highest dams and spanning a section of middle Yangtze River about 600 km in length. For the GRACE observations, the Three-Gorge Reservoir would represent a geophysical controlled experiment, one that offers a unique opportunity to do detailed geophysical studies. [...] Assuming a complete documentation of the water level and history of the water impoundment process and aided with a continual monitoring of the lithospheric loading response (such as in <b>area</b> <b>gravity</b> and deformation), one has at hand basically a classical forwardinverse modeling problem of surface loading, where the input and certain output are known. The invisible portion of the impounded water, i. e. underground storage, poses either added values as an observable or a complication as an unknown to be modeled. Wang (2000) has studied the possible loading effects on a local scale; we here aim for larger spatial scales upwards from several hundred km, with emphasis on the time-variable gravity signals that can be detected by GRACE and follow-on missions. Results using the Green s function approach on the PREM elastic Earth model indicate the geoid height variations reaching several millimeters on wavelengths of about a thousand kilometers. The corresponding vertical deformations have amplitude of a few centimeters. In terms of long-wavelength spherical harmonics, the induced geoid height variations are very close to the accuracy of GRACE- recoverable gravity field, while the low-degree (2 to 5) harmonics should be detectable. With a large regional time-variable gravity signal, the Three-Gorge experiment can serve as a useful calibration/verification for GRACE (including the elastic loading effects), and future gravity missions (especially for visco-elastic yielding as well as underground water variations) ...|$|E

In {{the whole}} Upper Jurassic {{succession}} {{in the vicinity}} of Cracow <b>area</b> <b>gravity</b> mass flow deposits are observed. They are represented mainly by debris-flows, grain-flows, and other gravity-flows, and were noted by Felisiak (1983), Koszarski (1995), Matyszkiewicz & Krajewski (1996), Matyszkiewicz (1996, 1997), Matyszkiewicz & 0 lszewska (2007), Ziółkowski (2007). The studied quarry is situated {{in the vicinity of}} Tomaszowice, at the N margin of the Krzeszowice Graben, some 15 km NE of Krakow. The outcrop is about 30 m long and 9 m high. At the base of the outcrop, bedded limestone with cherts is exposed. The limestone is white, varying in shade, beds are 0. 2 - 1 m thick, commonly contains cherts distributed along layer-parallel horizons and numerous dish-like and cup-shaped sponges occupying life position as well as microbial structures. The bedded limestone is overlain by a layer of greenish, plastic marl up to 15 cm thick. The marl rests on irregular top of bedded limestone with denivelation up to 1. 5 m. The marl is followed by a 3 m thick layer of fragmental carbonate composed of irregularly distributed zones of massive clast-supported or matrix-supported fabric, which also contain abundant chert fragments. The clasts are irregular in shape and their maximum diameter reaches 0. 4 m. The texture, structure and facies relations at Tomaszowice suggest sysnsedimentary origin of the fragmental limestone layer. Microfacies analysis indicates that the sediment {{at the base of the}} outcrop is developed as boundstone-wackestone. Siliceous sponges Hexactinellida & Lithistida, and microbial structures represented by thrombolites are the main constituents of boundstone that dominate in thin section. Tubiphytes and Terebella lapilloides are very common. Some of the sponges reveal borings filled by internal calcareous or ferrugineous sediment. The limestone clasts from the upper part of the outcrop are represented by boundstone-packstone, locally grainstone, both microfacies containing Tubiphytes, fragments of bivalves and siliceous sponges and Terebella lapilloides. Overturned sponges, microbial structures and geopetal fillings are common in larger boundstone clasts. Synsedimentary gravity mass flow deposits, like those observed in Tomaszowice outcrop, can be found near the northern margin of the Krzeszowice Graben (e. g. Matyszkiewicz 1996). This position suggests reactivation of a pre-existing fault zone within the underlying Palaeozoic bedrock, which occurred during the Oxfordian (Żaba 1999) as syndepositional deformation. Synsedimentary origin of these fragmental rocks, suggest the age of the margin at Tomaszowice may be dated at the Late Jurassic. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.
