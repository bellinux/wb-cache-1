5|$|As NY22 {{continues}} north, it remains, at first, within <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>of</b> Massachusetts, {{moving to}} the east to intersect with NY43 in Stephentown. North of that junction, it begins to run through a deep, isolated, lightly populated valley in the New York section of the Berkshires. Wide curves take the road through Berlin, where Berlin Mountain, the highest peak in the state outside of the Catskills and Adirondacks, caps the eastern skyline. Route22 trends further west, then back east to where NY2 crosses via an overpass at Petersburgh {{on its way to}} Petersburg Pass, the northernmost crossing of the New York–Massachusetts state line. The next road to head east from NY22, NY346 at North Petersburgh, enters Vermont.|$|E
5|$|Converge {{began writing}} Axe to Fall in November 2008. With Jacob Bannon, Kurt Ballou and Nate Newton all living within a half <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>of</b> {{each other in}} Boston, and Ben Koller living a couple hours away in Brooklyn, Converge could easily {{practice}} {{for weeks at a}} time. Though most songs originated from a guitar or bass riff from Ballou or Newton, all members had equal input on the writing process, with each member proposing different songs. Vocalist Bannon wrote a few songs for Axe to Fall, but were scrapped because they were slower {{than the rest of the}} songs, and did not fit the energy of the album.|$|E

5|$|On July 21, 1832, {{the militia}} {{caught up with}} Black Hawk's band as they {{attempted}} to cross the Wisconsin River, near present-day Roxbury, in Dane County, near Sauk City, Wisconsin. As the militia approached the battleground, warriors appeared on the surrounding hillsides, attempting to divert their attention. According to Dodge's account, before the militia met {{the main body of}} Black Hawk's band, three U.S. scouts crossed a small band of Sauk or Fox warriors and pursued them to within <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>of</b> their camp. Scouts also killed two Sauk warriors before the real battle began.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Hurricane Katrina and the {{subsequent}} 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans, the congregation's building at 7000 Canal Boulevard filled with at least ten feet of water, and Beth Israel garnered national attention after {{attempts were made to}} save its Torah scrolls. Beth Israel's rabbi, Yisroel Shiff, who had evacuated to Tennessee before Katrina hit, contacted Rabbi Isaac Leider, who had worked on ZAKA search-and-rescue teams in Israel for five years. After contacting federal officials and the Louisiana National Guard, Leider hired a helicopter to fly him to within <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>of</b> Beth Israel, met with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) search-and-rescue team appointed to retrieve the scrolls. The group used rubber rafts to reach Beth Israel and enter it, where Leider waded into the sanctuary and rescued the Torah scrolls and their silver ornaments.|$|E

5|$|California {{governor}} Jerry Brown {{declared a}} state of emergency for the city of San Francisco on August 23, after the fire caused damage to the power infrastructure serving the Bay Area, causing two out of the existing three hydroelectric power plants to shut down. The fire also threatened the Hetch Hetchy reservoir, the main source of water for San Francisco, providing up to 85% of the city's supply to 2.6 million customers. On August 26, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission moved water away from Hetch Hetchy into downstream reservoirs located in San Mateo and Alameda Counties as a precautionary measure, but did not expect the fire to cause any disruption to the city's water supply. The fire advanced to within <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>of</b> Hetch Hetchy by Monday, August 26, which was a concern to O'Shaughnessy Dam officials due to ash falling in the water.|$|E
5|$|Dubourdieu's {{squadron}} {{was spotted}} approaching {{the island of}} Lissa at 03:00 on 12 March 1811 by Captain Gordon in HMS Active, which had led the British squadron from Port St George on a cruise off Ancona. Turning west, the British squadron awaited the French approach in line ahead, sailing along the north coast of the island within half <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>of</b> the shoreline. By 06:00, Dubourdieu was approaching the British line from the north-east in two divisions, leading in Favorite {{at the head of}} the windward or western division. Dubourdieu hoped to pass ahead of Active {{at the head of the}} British line and cross it further east with Danaé, which led the leeward division. Dubourdieu intended to break the British line in two places and destroy the British squadron in the crossfire.|$|E
5|$|Garfield {{had been}} a regular visitor to the shore town of Long Branch, NJ, one of the nation’s premier summer {{vacation}} spots until World War I. In early September, {{it was decided to}} bring him to Elberon, a quiet beach town just to the south of Long Branch, in hopes that the beach air would help him recover. When they heard that the president was being brought to their town, local citizens built more than half <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>of</b> tracks in less than 24 hours, enabling Garfield to be brought directly {{to the door of the}} oceanfront Franklyn cottage, rather than being moved by carriage from the local Elberon train station. However, Garfield died 12 days later. A granite marker on Garfield Rd identifies the former site of the cottage, which was demolished in 1950.|$|E

5|$|I {{had settled}} {{an affair with}} five gentlemen of that country who were each of them to raise a {{regiment}} of dragoons well mounted and well armed which I knew they could easily do for the men had horses and homes of their own, and were, to say the truth most of them, the persons who some time since robbed the late Bishop of Winchester's Park, and have increased in their number ever since. They go {{by the name of}} the Waltham Blacks (tho few of them live there) which is a most loyal little town...I once saw two hundred and upwards of these Blacks in a body within half <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>of</b> my house. They had been running brandy. There was 24 customs officers following them who they abused heartily and carried off their cargo. I am told there is no less than a thousand of them and indeed I believe they have now taken loyalty into their heads, and will I hope prove very useful.|$|E
5|$|The club {{moved away}} from Filbert Street in 2002 to a new 32,500 all-seater stadium. The stadium was {{originally}} named The Walkers Stadium in a deal with food manufacturers Walkers, whose brand logo can still be found in some areas around {{the outside of the}} stadium. The first match hosted at Walkers was a 1–1 friendly draw against Athletic Bilbao, with Bilbao's Tiko being the first scorer at the stadium and Jordan Stewart being the first Leicester player to score. The first competitive match was a 2–0 victory against Watford. The stadium has since hosted an England international against Serbia and Montenegro, which finished 2–1 to England, as well as internationals between Brazil and Jamaica, and Jamaica and Ghana. The stadium has been used to host the Heineken Cup European Rugby semi-finals for the Leicester Tigers rugby club, itself based within <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>of</b> the King Power Stadium.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main public parks in Shaw and Crompton. Dunwood Park lies {{alongside}} the Oldham and Rochdale Metrolink Line {{and has a}} children's play area, bowling green, and over <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>of</b> wooded pathways along {{the base of a}} forested hillside. The land that forms Dunwood Park was presented to Crompton Urban District Council by Captain Abram Crompton JP on 22 June 1911, and opened as a park by him on 14 September 1912. It was redeveloped with a new park and bowling green for its 2012 centenary after winning a £1 million grant from the National Lottery. High Crompton Park is in High Crompton and is home to a tennis court, bowling green, children's play area, and gardens. Jubilee Gardens are found in the centre of Shaw and Crompton town centre, behind the Crompton War Memorial. Shaw and Crompton has large areas of land reserved for sporting and communal events; these are located off George Street, Edward Road, and Rushcroft Road respectively.|$|E

[...] After crossing Avenida Las Americas in downtown Ponce, the river {{comes to the}} location where in the 1970s it was diverted by the US Corps of Engineers from a southwesterly path to its current southeasterly path. Taking a sharp easterly turn, Río Portugués enters barrio San Antón, and crosses route PR-12/Avenida Malecon about one quarter <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> north <b>of</b> PR-12's intersection with PR-2. Shortly thereafter the river bends to become southbound and crosses route PR-2, about one quarter <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> east <b>of</b> PR-2's intersection with PR-12. The river then borders the Julio Enrique Monagas Family Park on the park's western edge until, still canalized, it feeds into Bucaná River about half <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> south <b>of</b> PR-2.

5|$|The 1843 {{event was}} {{followed}} by eruptions in 1849, 1851, 1852, and 1855, with the 1855 flows being particularly extensive. 1859 marked {{the largest of the}} three historical flows that have been centered on Mauna Loa's northwestern flank, producing a long lava flow that reached the ocean on Hawaii island's west coast, north of Kiholo Bay. An eruption in 1868 occurred alongside the enormous 1868 Hawaii earthquake, a magnitude eight event that claimed 77 lives and remains the largest earthquake ever to hit the island. Following further activity in 1871, Mauna Loa experienced nearly continuous activity from August 1872 through 1877, a long-lasting and voluminous eruption lasting approximately 1,200 days and never moving beyond its summit. A short single-day eruption in 1877 was unusual in that it took place underwater, in Kealakekua Bay, and within <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>of</b> the shoreline; curious onlookers approaching the area in boats reported unusually turbulent water and occasional floating blocks of hardened lava. Further eruptions occurred in 1879 and then twice in 1880, the latter of which extended into 1881 and came within the present boundaries of the island's largest city, Hilo; however, at the time, the settlement was a shore-side village located further down the volcano's slope, and so was unaffected.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Division was {{temporarily}} relieved and to cover its replacement by the US Fifth Army, BSquadron {{was attached to}} the 4th New Zealand Infantry Brigade, C Squadron to the 5th New Zealand Infantry and A Squadron to the 6th New Zealand Infantry. On the morning of 11 August, C Squadron supported the 23rd Battalion advance from Emboli to the Arno River. B Squadron was positioned in San Vito and A Squadron behind the Pesa River. The regiment withdrew to the divisional area near Castellina on 16 August, moving with the division to Iesi on the Adriatic. Arriving on 29 August, it was transferred to Fano on 5 September. The regiment moved back into the line on 22 September at Rimini, advancing along Route 16 towards Ravenna. On 29 September, all armoured cars were recalled due to heavy rain and poor visibility. Wilder Force was re-formed on 3 October from the dismounted regiment and a machine-gun platoon and it began crossing the Fiumicino River on 15 October. Four days later, Wilder Force was dissolved and the regiment returned to its vehicles. On 21 October, B and C Squadrons attempted to secure the area around Pisignano and were within <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>of</b> the town {{by the end of the}} day. Since it was strongly held by the Axis, the 22nd Battalion came forward and the squadrons withdrew.|$|E
5|$|York City F.C. {{played at}} Fulfordgate in Fulford, on the {{southern}} outskirts of York, from 1922 to 1932. It was difficult for most supporters to reach, being a good distance from the railway station, and the tram service to Fulford only had a single track. Attendances declined in the club's second and third seasons in the Football League, which the directors blamed on Fulfordgate's location. One director, G. W. Halliday, became convinced that the only solution was {{to move to a}} new ground. York Cricket Club left Bootham Crescent, their home for around 50 years, for a new ground at Wigginton Road in January 1932. Preliminary discussions and visits to Bootham Crescent took place, and the directors believed that renting the ground would be cheaper than repaying the debts on Fulfordgate. Further, Bootham Crescent was situated near the centre of the city, and the population living within <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>of</b> the site was, at 30,000, 10 times that within a similar radius of Fulfordgate. However, two former directors argued that attendances at many grounds had fallen during the Great Depression, and that the approaches and surrounds to Bootham Crescent were limited.|$|E
