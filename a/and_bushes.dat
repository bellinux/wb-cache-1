5|$|At higher {{elevations}} above the lake (especially in rocky or exposed locations), the pine and fir tree forests are thinner, {{and the trees}} grow in a more stunted fashion; instead, shrubs <b>and</b> <b>bushes,</b> such as green manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula), dwarf mountain manzanita (Arctostaphylos neuadensis), and tan oak (Lithocarpus densiflorus) find areas and niches to grow.|$|E
5|$|Outside its {{breeding}} season, the russet sparrow is gregarious {{and forms}} flocks to find food, though it infrequently associates with other birds. Wintering flocks tend {{to keep away}} from human habitation. The russet sparrow is also social at night during the winter, and it forms large communal roosts in trees <b>and</b> <b>bushes.</b> In the breeding season, the female roosts in the nests and the male nests in foliage nearby.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{in large}} {{bodies of water}} differs {{markedly}} from camouflage on land. The environment {{is essentially the same}} on all sides. Light always falls from above, and there is generally no variable background to compare with trees <b>and</b> <b>bushes.</b> Three main camouflage methods predominate in water: transparency, reflection, and counter-illumination. Transparency and reflectivity are most important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counter-illumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres.|$|E

5|$|Marsh {{and then}} Hatcher {{assumed that the}} animal was aquatic, because of the {{position}} of its nasal openings at the apex of the cranium. Similar aquatic behavior was commonly depicted for other large sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. A 1951 study by Kenneth A. Kermack indicates that sauropods probably could not have breathed through their nostrils {{when the rest of the}} body was submerged, as the water pressure on the chest wall would be too great. Since the 1970s, general consensus has the sauropods as firmly terrestrial animals, browsing on trees, ferns, <b>and</b> <b>bushes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Silviculture is the {{practice}} of controlling the establishment, growth, composition, health, and quality of forests, which are areas that have a high density of trees. Cultivated trees are planted and tended by humans, usually because they provide food (fruits or nuts), ornamental beauty, or some type of wood product that benefits people. An area of land planted with fruit or nut trees is an orchard. A small wooded area, usually with no undergrowth, is called a grove and a small wood or thicket of trees <b>and</b> <b>bushes</b> is called a coppice or copse. A large area of land covered with trees and undergrowth is called woodland or forest. An area of woodland composed primarily of trees established by planting or artificial seeding {{is known as a}} plantation.|$|E
5|$|The addax live {{in desert}} terrain where they eat grasses and leaves of what shrubs, leguminous herbs <b>and</b> <b>bushes</b> are available. Primarily grazers, their staple foods include Aristida, Panicum, and Stipagrostis, {{and they will}} only consume browse, such as leaves of Acacia trees {{in the absence of}} these grasses. Perennials which turn green and sprout at the {{slightest}} bit of humidity or rain. The addax eat only certain parts of the plant and tend to crop the Aristida grasses neatly to the same height. By contrast, when feeding on Panicum grass, the drier outer leaves are left alone while they eat the tender, inner shoots and seeds. These seeds are important part of the addax diet, being their main source of protein.|$|E

5|$|The addax mainly eats {{grasses and}} leaves of any {{available}} shrubs, leguminous herbs <b>and</b> <b>bushes.</b> These animals are well-adapted {{to exist in}} their desert habitat, as they can live without water {{for long periods of}} time. Addax form herds of five to 20 members, consisting of both males and females. They are led by the oldest female. Due to its slow movements, the antelope is an easy target for its predators: lions, humans, African wild dogs, cheetahs, and leopards. Breeding season is at its peak during winter and early spring. The natural habitat of the addax are arid regions, semideserts and sandy and stony deserts.|$|E

Blobby's game also now became known as Blobby's Office Trolley which saw him as a postman for the BBC with viewers having to guess which celebrity a letter was for.|$|E
5|$|The long-tailed {{ground roller}} is a shy and elusive bird and, if {{seen by a}} human observer, it either freezes or runs away. As its short wings suggest, the species rarely flies, {{but it is a}} {{powerful}} runner. While largely terrestrial, it roosts in low trees <b>and</b> <b>bushes,</b> and sings from low perches. Long-tailed ground rollers are solitary outside the breeding season. Although diurnal, it does occasionally forage at night unlike most other ground rollers. When calling, this ground roller bobs its head and raises its tail. The long-tailed ground roller also raises its tail when it is excited.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} {{vigilance}} behaviour of herds revealed that individuals on {{the borders of}} herds {{tend to be more}} cautious; vigilance decreases with group size. Group size and distance from roads <b>and</b> <b>bushes</b> were found to have major influence on vigilance, more among the grazing springbok than among their browsing counterparts. Adults were found to be more vigilant than juveniles, and males more vigilant than females. Springbok passing through bushes tend to be more vulnerable to predator attacks as they can not be easily alerted, and predators usually conceal themselves in bushes. Another study calculated that the time spent in vigilance by springbok on the edges of herds is roughly double that spent by those in the centre and the open. Springbok were found to be more cautious in the late morning than at dawn or in the afternoon, and more at night than in the daytime. Rates and methods of vigilance were found to vary with the aim of lowering risk from predators.|$|E
5|$|During the wet season, food is {{abundant}} and giraffes are more spread out, while {{during the dry}} season, they gather around the remaining evergreen trees <b>and</b> <b>bushes.</b> Mothers tend to feed in open areas, presumably {{to make it easier}} to detect predators, although this may reduce their feeding efficiency. As a ruminant, the giraffe first chews its food, then swallows it for processing and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again. It is common for a giraffe to salivate while feeding. The giraffe requires less food than many other herbivores because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system. The animal's faeces come in the form of small pellets. When it has access to water, a giraffe drinks at intervals no longer than three days.|$|E
5|$|In {{his spare}} time, Wright {{developed}} a fruit farm {{on the property}} with over a thousand fruit trees <b>and</b> <b>bushes</b> that he ordered from Jens Jensen in 1912. It is unknown exactly how many were planted, because part of the order was destroyed during a railroad strike. Wright requested two hundred and eighty-five apple trees planted, including one hundred McIntosh, fifty Wealthy, fifty Golden Russet, and fifty Fameuse. Among the bushes were three hundred gooseberry, two hundred blackberry, and two hundred raspberry. The property also grew pears, asparagus, rhubarb, and plums. The fruit and vegetable plants were placed along the contour of the estate, {{which may have been}} done to mimic the farms he saw while in Italy. Wright also dammed a creek on the property to create an artificial lake, which was stocked with fish and aquatic fowl. This water garden, probably inspired by the ones he saw in Japan, created a natural gateway to the property.|$|E

5|$|The flesh-footed shearwater, which breeds {{in large}} numbers on the main island in spring-autumn, used to have its chicks {{harvested}} for food by the islanders. The wedge-tailed and little shearwaters breed on the main island and surrounding islets; though {{only a small number}} of the latter species can be found on the main island. Breeding white-bellied storm petrels were another discovery by Roy Bell. Masked boobies are the largest seabirds breeding on Lord Howe and can be seen nesting and gliding along the sea cliffs at Mutton Bird Point all year round. Sooty terns can be seen on the main island at Ned's and Middle Beaches, North Bay, and Blinkey Beach; the most numerous of the island's breeding seabirds, their eggs were formerly harvested for food. Common and black noddies build nests in trees <b>and</b> <b>bushes,</b> while white terns lay their single eggs precariously in a slight depression on a tree branch, and grey ternlets lay their eggs in cliff hollows.|$|E
5|$|Erosion can be {{the result}} of {{material}} movement by the wind. There are two main effects. First, wind causes small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region. This is called deflation. Second, these suspended particles may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession). Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation. An example is the formation of sand dunes, on a beach or in a desert. Loess is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, friable, slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, silty, pale yellow or buff, windblown (Aeolian) sediment. It generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick. Loess often stands in either steep or vertical faces. Loess tends to develop into highly rich soils. Under appropriate climatic conditions, areas with loess are among the most agriculturally productive in the world. Loess deposits are geologically unstable by nature, and will erode very readily. Therefore, windbreaks (such as big trees <b>and</b> <b>bushes)</b> are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of loess.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that the spread of Armillaria root rot in {{eucalypt}} forests is associated with infected stumps that remain after an area has been logged. Armillaria luteobubalina can persist on these stumps, using them as a source of food for up to 25 or more years. In one case reported in Ovens, Victoria, the disease was spread to blueberry plants (Vaccinium species) via buried fragments of infected Eucalyptus that remained following preparation of the previously forested site for planting. In individual forest stands, fungal infection is usually found in discrete disease patches separated by stands of healthy trees—a discontinuous distribution. Large-scale aerial photography can be used to identify regions of forest infected by the species. The species also causes damage to trees <b>and</b> <b>bushes</b> in coastal dune woodlands, shrubland, and heath communities. It can be found on a wide range of hosts, but is most commonly associated with (in order of decreasing frequency) jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), bull banksia (Banksia grandis), marri (E.calophylla), Lasiopetalum floribundum, and Acacia saligna. It has also infected scattered populations of wandoo (E. wandoo). The fungus has also been reported to infect Nothofagus species in Argentina, and Pinus radiata in Chile.|$|E
