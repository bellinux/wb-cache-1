5|$|In March 2008, the BBC {{announced}} that Larry Lamb had been cast as Archie Mitchell, {{the brother of}} Peggy's late husband Eric. Archie was scripted as a love-interest for Peggy and Peggy's backstory was retconned to incorporate a romantic history with Archie. Portrayed as an adulterous villain, Archie began controlling Peggy, changing her clothing <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> style and instructing her on how to behave.|$|E
5|$|The show's co-creators, Fawcett and Graeme Manson, {{along with}} Maslany <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> and makeup artists, {{developed}} {{the character of}} Tony {{over a period of}} six months after deciding that the inclusion of a transgender character would fit well with the show's themes of identity, gender and sexuality. Overall, the episode received mixed reviews: critics praised Maslany's performance but found Tony's character underdeveloped and gimmicky and found the plot disorganised.|$|E
5|$|Kerrigan's {{infestation}} by the Zerg {{signaled a}} major overhaul for her appearance. Despite maintaining her stature, build, and facial features, she {{is described in}} Queen of Blades as having mottled green skin, covered in a glossy protective carapace. Kerrigan's eyes are bright yellow as opposed to her natural green, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> has transformed into stalks, described as being segmented like an insect's legs. Kerrigan's fingers are stated to now contain extendible claws. A pair of skeletal wings has also grown from her back, consisting of elongated segmented spikes that reach down {{to the level of}} her knees. Kerrigan is seen using these wings as a melee weapon, tearing opponents apart.|$|E
25|$|After Bourne tells Nicky {{she will}} have to run, Nicky dyes <b>and</b> cuts <b>her</b> <b>hair,</b> similar to the scene in The Bourne Identity with Marie dyeing <b>and</b> cutting <b>her</b> <b>hair.</b> She even cuts <b>and</b> dyes <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> into an {{identical}} style.|$|R
60|$|He stooped {{suddenly}} <b>and</b> took <b>her</b> in his arms, raised <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> kissed <b>her</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|R
60|$|She laughed mockingly, <b>and</b> shook <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> {{like a wild}} young colt.|$|R
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Vogue did a spread called “Grunge & Glory” with fashion {{photographer}} Steven Miesel who shot supermodels Naomi Campbell and Kristen McMenamy in a savanna landscape wearing grunge-styled clothing. This shoot made McMenamy the face for grunge, {{as she had}} her eyebrows shaved <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> cropped short. Designers like Christian Lacroix, Donna Karen and Karl Lagerfeld incorporated the grunge influence into their looks. In 1993, James Truman, editor of Details, said: “to me the thing about grunge is it’s not anti-fashion, it’s unfashion. Punk was anti-fashion. It made a statement. Grunge is about not making a statement, which is why it’s crazy for it to become a fashion statement.” The unkempt fashion sense defined {{the look of the}} “slacker generation”, who “skipped school, smoked pot... cigarettes and listened to music” hoping to become a rock star one day.|$|E
5|$|Ivy's {{alternate}} character {{designs in}} the games are a contrast to her primary designs, with the secondary from Soulcalibur to Soulcalibur III consisting of countess attire of either blue or red pants, vest, and jacket, with white boots covering her feet <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> combed back. In Soulcalibur II, a tertiary alternate design was added consisting of a red leotard and gloves with gold trimming, with red stockings on her legs; in addition, a fourth design resembling her appearance {{at the conclusion of}} Soulcalibur was considered, incorporating a cloak and the symbol of caduceus on the front of her leotard cupping her breasts, but was unused. In Soulcalibur III, a long, rose-themed dress with hat and veil was used as a tertiary alternate, one of several considered designs. For Soulcalibur IV, a similarly themed black dress was used as her sole alternate design for the game.|$|E
25|$|For the sitting, Adeline {{was dressed}} in a blue dress, the {{background}} was blue <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> ribbon was blue.|$|E
60|$|She drew {{herself up}} <b>and</b> resolutely dried <b>her</b> eyes <b>and</b> readjusted <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> hood <b>and</b> mantle.|$|R
25|$|<b>And</b> <b>her</b> enchanted <b>hair</b> was {{the first}} gold.|$|R
60|$|And Caroline, sitting {{near her}} mother, rearranged <b>her</b> muslin {{handkerchief}} <b>and</b> resmoothed <b>her</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|R
25|$|Following {{the sixth}} season, Willow struggles to allow herself to perform magic without the {{darkness}} within her taking her over. She {{is no longer}} able to abstain from magic as it is such an integral part of her that doing so will kill her. In the instances when she is highly emotional the darkness comes out. Willow must control that part of her and is occasionally unable to do so, giving her a trait similar to Angel, a cursed vampire who fears losing his soul will turn him evil. In a redemptive turn, when Willow turns all the Potentials into Slayers, she glows <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> turns white, astonishing Kennedy and prompting her to call Willow a goddess.|$|E
25|$|Once Henry had {{withdrawn}} with {{the bulk of}} the imperial army the towns that had supposedly fallen to the Empire immediately declared their allegiance to Tancred, for the most part now fearing his retribution. Nicholas of Ajello, son of Matthew and former Archbishop of Salerno, who was helping defend Naples, wrote letters about the events to his friends in Salerno. Thus the populace of Salerno saw an opportunity to win some favour with Tancred, so they besieged the defenseless Constance at Castel Terracena. Constance presented herself on a balcony and spoke to them in the tone of mild remonstrance and admonition, trying to tell them that the situation might improve and the defeat of Henry might be exaggerated by Nicholas, but the Salernitans were determined to capture her for Tancred, so they continued the siege. Constance locked herself in her room, locked the windows, and prayed to God for help and revenge. After a rapid negotiation with Elia di Gesualdo, a distant relative of Tancred, Constance voluntarily went out under the condition that her German garrison were to be allowed to leave unharmed. She was then arrested by Elia (and some barons of Apulia who were related to her) and delivered to Tancred in Messina by Admiral Margaritus of Brindisi (her brother-in-law who had helped in the defence of Naples), on a bireme galley or dromon with 200 rowers. She was in her attire as empress, wearing a dress quilted with gold and decorated with roses, a cloak covered with precious jewels, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> was strewn with gems, making her look like a goddess. Thus she became an important and valuable prize given that Henry had every intention of returning. When meeting Constance Tancred blamed her for the invasion, but she proudly responded that she was just taking back her dominion robbed by Tancred.|$|E
500|$|According to Kline, Yeats {{compared}} Olivia to Diana and Maud to Helen; he {{was attracted}} to dark coloured women, describing Olivia's skin as [...] "a little darker than a Greek's would have been <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> was very dark". Literary scholar Humphrey Carpenter writes that Yeats' impression of Olivia {{was one of a}} woman with [...] "a profound culture, a knowledge of French, English, and Italian and seemed always at leisure. Her nature was gentle and contemplative, and she was content, it seems, to have no more of life than leisure and the talk of her friends".|$|E

500|$|.....Bane {{managed to}} capture {{much of the}} ex-mayor's character: Her eyes are {{friendly}} <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> as wild as ever. But Katz's signature grin is a little stiff, a little too aggressive. Leaning forward, she looks {{as if she might}} take a bite out of the next passerby. Which by the way, seems appropriate when you look back on her days behind the mayoral desk. Maybe monochromatic bronze just isn't the right medium for a woman as colorful as ol' Vera. Where's the red blazer? Our suggestion: Get this lady some accessories! The right hat or scarf could make that brown pantsuit really work.|$|E
500|$|For the 2009 title Resident Evil 5, {{production}} director Yasuhiro Anpo {{explained that}} the designers tried to show how Valentine and Redfield had changed with time. They retained the characters' signature colours: blue for Valentine and green for Redfield. In the game, Valentine's skin is paler <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> blonde, both said to be side-effects from having been forced to be a test subject. Voth's likeness was used again in Resident Evil 5 and other games in the series, but not in [...] (2012), which is set at sea. Her costume, in her signature blue colour, resembles a wetsuit. Her buoyancy control device was designed to have more tactical gear attached, but the gear was removed to show her [...] "bodyline".|$|E
500|$|In April 2015, Square Enix {{announced}} that the engine will support DirectX 12, and Nvidia revealed a new real-time tech demo developed by Square Enix for the engine, called Witch Chapter 0 , featuring the character Agni from the earlier Agni's Philosophy demo. The demo renders over 63 million polygons per frame, uses [...] "8K by 8K" [...] resolution textures, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> is rendered with over 50 shaders, with each strand of hair rendered as a polygon. It also portrays human crying {{with a high level}} of detail, and the quality of the real-time graphics have been compared to pre-rendered CGI animation. The tech demo took a year to produce, and was running on a PC with four GeForce GTX Titan X graphics cards.|$|E

60|$|Then, {{understanding}} that she expected something more, d'Aguilar nerved {{himself to the}} task, <b>and</b> touched <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> with his lips.|$|R
500|$|Charlene was a {{self-described}} tomboy, who preferred {{to be known}} by her nickname [...] "Lenny". She was known for her quick temper and her [...] "heart of gold". She always stuck up {{for those who were}} considered the underdog. In her book Neighbours: The First 10 Years, Josephine Monroe wrote that Charlene did not like to be patronised and had a sharp tongue. Monroe observed that Charlene's feisty side helped endure her to viewers. In keeping with her tomboyish nature, Charlene trained as a mechanic after leaving school and got an apprenticeship with Rob Lewis (Ernie Bourne). The character's style often consisted of khaki overalls, baggy sweatshirts <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> set in a perm. A reporter for the Daily Mail said this look helped to launch Minogue [...] "into the public eye" [...] as Charlene.|$|E
500|$|She {{just sort}} of sits there with her {{cigarette}} <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair,</b> and she would pull stuff— these very disparate elements— and put them together into this ensemble, and you'd go, [...] "Come on, Pat, you can't wear that with that." [...] She'd say, [...] "Eh, just try it on." [...] So you'd put it on, and {{not only did it}} work, but it works on so many different levels— and it allows you to figure out who the guy is. Those outfits achieve exactly what I was trying to achieve. There's flamboyance, there's real risk-taking, but when I walk into the room, it's not flashy. It's actually very subtle. You look at it and you go, [...] "That shirt, that tie, that jacket, that vest? What?" [...] But it works.|$|E
500|$|... "On , I {{really just}} wanted to put the mirror back onto the whole experience. You can see that she {{had that kind of}} confidence. And, literally, every take became a more and more {{confident}} take, so that she could have fun with what was going on. Not being over-the-top sarcastic, but ... having a laugh at everything that was going on around her, with confidence. [...] The very last dance of the piece, she had her hair up, and I go, 'Can you just do one for me with your hair down?' She dropped her hair down. You'll see we intercut with her hair up <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> down. That was the last piece. She just rocked it from her heart. She choreographed that last dance at the very end. She did that on her own and said, 'Let's go for it'".|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> she unpinned <b>her</b> hat <b>and</b> patted <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> {{before the}} small mirror, into {{which she had}} to peep to see herself. Alvina stood waiting.|$|R

50|$|Beautiful Secretary K (Bijin Hisho Kē) and Beautiful Secretary S (Bijin Hisho Esu) are Gozo's spies. They are as {{ruthless}} {{and cruel}} as their boss. S dresses {{in a black}} leotard <b>and</b> wears <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> tied behind <b>her</b> head. K has green leotards <b>and</b> lets <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> drape {{to the right side}} of her head. Both die in the collapse of the Ghost Bank, denied their attempt to escape by Coolgin in the guise of God Neros.|$|R
500|$|Two heroines were {{subsequently}} added to To Heart 2 story in later {{versions of the}} game. Sasara Kusugawa becomes the student council president of Takaaki's school during his second year. She inherits her position from the previous president Ma-ryan, as {{she is the only}} remaining student council member after the latter's graduation. Sasara is very diligent, often completing all of the student council's tasks by herself. She is often feared by students for her strict attitude, but is actually disguising a shy and gentle personality. [...] Mio Hanesaki is Takaaki's classmate. She remains largely unnoticed by other students, most of whom remain oblivious of her name. She originally ties her hair up and wears eyeglasses, but later wears contact lens <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> untied as an attempt by Takaaki to change the impression she gives to others.|$|E
500|$|On May 5, 2011, Interscope {{sent out}} {{an e-mail to}} radio {{stations}} across the United States, which stated that [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] was to be released on Monday, May 9, 2011, as {{the first of two}} promotional single for Born This Way. It was to serve as the first song in the [...] "Countdown to Born This Way" [...] promotion on iTunes Store. However, after its release to the digital stores, [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] started selling a considerable amount of digital downloads, prompting Gaga to make it the third single from Born This Way. On her Twitter account Gaga revealed the cover for the single. It showed Gaga topless with her mouth open, wearing her facial prosthetics from the [...] "Born This Way" [...] cover, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> wildly cascading around her.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{confessed that}} it was not easy for him {{to come up with the}} lyrics to [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] in that length of time. But two hours later, he had written the verses, and the hook, in spite of being hung over. Harrison had also made {{provision}} for a backing track; he played all the instruments on the track. The bridge was written by Beyoncé, who was inspired by looking at herself in the mirror; as she was not wearing matching clothes <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> was untidy, she kept saying, [...] "I'm looking so crazy right now." [...] Harrison sang back to her and said, [...] "That's the hook." [...] It also inspired the title of the song. After that Beyoncé had filled up the middle eight, she came up with the catchphrase – [...] "Uh-oh, uh-oh, you know" [...] – alongside Harrison.|$|E
60|$|There {{she sat on}} a couch, {{her eyes}} red with weeping, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> curling <b>hair</b> unbound.|$|R
