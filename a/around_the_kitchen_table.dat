5|$|Meanwhile, Chris {{learns that}} his best customer, Herbert, has made Kyle, a neighbor's {{son and a}} bully, his new paper boy. Chris decides to confront them both but ends up getting pushed over by Kyle and laughed at by Kyle's friends {{subsequently}} returning home in tears much to Peter and Lois' concern. Peter goes to talk with Kyle who makes fun of him over and over. Unable to control his anger toward Kyle, Peter beats him up leaving Kyle bleeding and bruised. Kyle’s mother agrees not to press charges if Peter apologizes to Kyle which he reluctantly does. Kyle comments on how good bullying makes you feel which encourages Peter to become a bully. Peter splashes a {{pot of boiling water}} over Lois and makes her punch herself in the face. He also hits Stewie on his sunburned buttocks, knocks Chris out of his chair, and sticks his large butt out at Meg to fart repeatedly in her face following her backwards <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> until she finally trips and vomits on the floor at which Peter gets mad with her. When Peter also bullies his friends, such as using Joe as a marionette and pulling Cleveland's pants down, Lois points out that he is as bad as his old school bully, Randy Fulcher. Deciding he should bully him instead, Peter finds Randy who is now suffering from multiple sclerosis. Thinking, when Randy says “I have MS,” that he is bragging that he has a monkey’s scrotum, Peter is about to beat up Randy but is stopped by Chris who beats Peter up instead and finally convinces him bullying is wrong. As the event is witnessed by a wrong sounding Kermit the Frog and a wrong sounding Swedish Chef, a wrong sounding Fozzie Bear (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) asks them if they want to hear a joke as the episode ends.|$|E
25|$|The Golden Girls {{was shot}} on {{videotape}} {{in front of}} a live studio audience. Many episodes of the series followed a similar format or theme. For example, {{one or more of the}} women would become involved in some sort of problem, often involving other family members, men, or an ethical dilemma. At some point, they would gather <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> and discuss the problem, sometimes late at night and often while eating cheesecake or some other dessert. One of the other girls then told a story from her own life, which somehow related to the problem (though Rose occasionally regaled a nonsense story that had nothing to do with the situation, and Sophia told outrageous made-up stories). Some episodes featured flashbacks to previous episodes, flashbacks to events not shown in previous episodes, or to events that occurred before the series began. Though the writing was mostly comical, dramatic moments and sentimental endings were included in several episodes. One of the actresses on the show, Bea Arthur, actually hated cheesecake.|$|E
5000|$|Orwell did not {{invent the}} idea behind the term [...] "two minutes hate"; it was already in use in the First World War. At that time, British writers satirised the German {{campaign}} of hatred against the English, and imagined a Prussian family sitting <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> having its [...] "morning hate".|$|E
50|$|Lang {{was born}} in 1942 to a musical family in east end Montreal.

5000|$|During their {{residency}} at Leeders Farm, {{the band}} spent most mornings rehearsing <b>around</b> <b>the</b> studio's <b>kitchen</b> <b>table.</b> Due to other professional commitments, guitarist Robbie Gladwell was absent {{for much of}} the recording, leaving Barry Wickens to cover the electric guitar parts on half of the album. By the end of October, nine songs were nearing completion and the remainder of the year saw Harley spend more time in the studio to finish the album, including recording vocals and mixing the tracks. In a November diary entry, he revealed: [...] "Stranger Comes to Town, new CD, likely to be released early May. Got 10 new songs. Three of them are co-written with various guys. Tunes only. Not words. Only wish any one of them had a literary bent, too. The lyrics have been the toughest part, as usual." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{party was}} {{launched}} in August 2005, after which Russell Bate, one of the party founders, stated that [...] "The thing that first caused us to gather <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> and say, 'We'd better do something', was {{the prospect of the}} Greens holding the balance of power. At this stage that's the saga we're trying to avoid." ...|$|E
50|$|Other snow rituals include walking {{backwards}} to bed, placing a snowball or a white crayon in the freezer, leaving a spoon under one’s pillow while sleeping, running <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> five times, and chanting “I {{want it to}} snow” {{three times in a}} row. All of these superstitions are to help influence the temperature to drop and for snow to fall.|$|E
5000|$|Ricky Wilder (Mary Page Keller) is a 28-year-old {{nurse and}} single mother, raising {{her family in}} her {{childhood}} home after her parents' deaths. Ricky's only actual child was her 6-year-old daughter Sophie (Tina Majorino), {{but she was also}} the principal guardian to her teenage siblings, 16-year-old Brody (Jerry O'Connell) and 13-year-old Melissa (Meghann Haldeman). From the time their parents died, Ricky understood that she couldn't change out of her persona as the [...] "cool, approachable" [...] older sister, and mixed parenting tactics in with the setting of a casual, laissez-faire household. In fact, the atmosphere in the Wilder house was so laid-back that many of Brody and Melissa's friends sought it as a refuge from the stricter, more confining homes run by their traditional parents. Ricky thus welcomed them all in with open arms, and they regularly sat <b>around</b> <b>the</b> family's <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> and dished about life's various happenings and dilemmas, while Ricky helped them sort out their issues and dispensed sound advice in a non-judgmental, friend-like way. As a result, the neighborhood youth nicknamed their home [...] "Camp Wilder." ...|$|R

50|$|In {{his early}} grades, Lamberto {{attended}} Escuela Narcisa Primero, a strict yet creative {{private school in}} Juarez, which catered to gifted students and instilled in him both discipline and a love of the arts. Young Lamberto became a distinguished student in the arts, math and science, and became fluent in Spanish. At age 6, he also discovered the magic of art from his parents, who both possessed a gift for drawing. They would spend weekend evenings entertaining their children by drawing and scribbling <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E

50|$|In reality, {{this very}} {{successful}} advertising campaign was originated by Harry Trenner {{and his wife}} Florence Shapiro Trenner. Harry Trenner was, at that time, working for the William Weintrob Advertising Agency in New York City, and Maidenform {{was one of his}} accounts. They both would tell the story that they were sitting <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> after dinner in their home in the Wykagyl Park section of New Rochelle, New York. They hit on the idea for the ad and Harry took it to the agency which expanded it and showed it to Maidenform.|$|E
50|$|There were {{sleeping}} {{bags on the}} expansive porches, bleary-eyed writer-folk sitting <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> come morning (or afternoon...) and many a story idea was expounded, dissected, and fleshed out. Folk songs were sung, guitars and an upright piano backed decidedly non-professional voices who made up in enthusiasm for what they lacked in technique. Rock bands practiced and jammed in Arrowhead's basement studio space during the 1970s. One alumnus of these sessions, Damon Knight's son Christopher, went on to found the Los Angeles Recording Workshop (see External Links, below), {{one of the largest}} and most elaborate recording instruction facilities in the world.|$|E

5000|$|Dave Pierce was the Director of Music for the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. His {{compositions}} {{were used}} as the underpinning of the Opening and Closing Ceremonies {{as well as the}} daily medals presentations. His controversial arrangement of the Canadian national anthem [...] "O Canada" [...] as performed at the Opening Ceremony of February 12, 2010 created a nationwide media frenzy where Canadians either strongly loved or hated the arrangement, with little room being occupied in the middle. For a nation who rarely publicly announced patriotic sentiment, Pierce's arrangement sparked a conversation about the anthem that had never before been heard in forums from the National media to Canadians gathered <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Oral {{storytelling}} is prevalent throughout Faces in the Moon. Oral storytelling is {{very important}} in Cherokee culture because it is a communal activity. Gracie and Rozella sit <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> and tell stories. Lizzie tells stories to Lucie. Although Gracie constantly reminds readers that Lucie does not have a story, Lucie is in fact telling her own story through the novel. Lucie often complains that she is tired of living in the past through stories. However, she acknowledges their importance in her life and says, [...] "no matter how great my desire to run away from home, to live in a place and history free from secrets, I always take up my position at the table" [...] (5). The novel itself also sounds like the spoken word. Readers get the sense that they are listening in on a conversation, maybe even participating at times, rather than having limited participation as outsiders. The book is dense with women’s voices. Perhaps this is Bell’s way of giving agency back to women after their voices had been left out due to colonization.|$|E
5000|$|Jack Gannon, a {{professor}} at Gallaudet University, said this about Deaf culture. [...] "Deaf culture {{is a set of}} learned behaviors and perceptions that shape the values and norms of deaf people based on their shared or common experiences." [...] Some doctors believe that being deaf makes a person more social. Bill Vicar, from ASL University, shared his experiences as a deaf person, [...] "people tend to congregate <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> rather than the living room sofa… our good-byes take nearly forever, and our hellos often consist of serious hugs. When two of us meet {{for the first time we}} tend to exchange detailed biographies." [...] Deaf culture is not about contemplating what deaf people cannot do and how to fix their problems, an approach known as the [...] "pathological view of the deaf." [...] Instead deaf people celebrate what they can do. There is a strong sense of unity between deaf people as they share their experiences of suffering through a similar struggle. This celebration creates a unity between even deaf strangers. Bill Vicars expresses the power of this bond when stating, [...] "if given the chance to become hearing most people would choose to remain deaf." ...|$|E
5000|$|Maxwell House was the long-time {{sponsor of}} the early {{television}} series Mama, based on the play and film I Remember Mama. It starred Peggy Wood as the matriarch of a Norwegian-American family. It ran on the CBS network from 1949 to 1957 and was perhaps the first example of product placement on a TV show, as the family frequently gathered <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> {{for a cup of}} Maxwell House coffee, though these segments, aired towards the end of each episode, were usually kept separate from the main storyline. Early television programs were frequently packaged by the advertising agencies of individual sponsors. As this practice became less common in the late 1950s, Maxwell House, like most national brands, turned to [...] "spot" [...] advertising, with the agencies creating sometimes long-running campaigns in support of their products. One such 1970s campaign for Maxwell House featured the actress Margaret Hamilton, the former wicked witch in The Wizard of Oz, as Cora, the general store owner who proudly announced that Maxwell House was the only brand she sold. Maxwell House was also a well-known {{sponsor of the}} Burns and Allen radio show, during which Maxwell House spots were incorporated into the plots of the actual radio scripts.|$|E
