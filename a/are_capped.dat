5|$|In England, {{tuition fees}} <b>are</b> <b>capped</b> at £9,250 {{a year for}} UK and EU students, with around 76% of all {{institutions}} charging the full amount in 2015-16. A loan {{of the same size}} is available for most universities, although students of private institutions are only eligible for £6,000 a year loans.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{layers of}} mudstone, {{conglomerate}} and siltstone interrupt the limestone horizontally. These layers are {{more resistant to}} attack by carbonic acid and they can therefore act as protective capstones of fins, windows and hoodoos. Many of the more durable hoodoos <b>are</b> <b>capped</b> with a type of magnesium-rich limestone called dolomite. Dolomite dissolves at a much slower rate, and consequently protects the weaker limestone underneath.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} was originally inlaid with precious and semi-precious stones. It reflects {{a mixture of}} contemporary traditions {{at the time of}} its construction, with a sloping-roof based on a Bengali style, and a baldachin from Europe, which makes evident the imperial as well as religious function of the pavilion. The marble shades of the pavilion <b>are</b> <b>capped</b> with merlons to hide view from the grounds.|$|E

5|$|To {{make the}} solid support {{material}} suitable for oligonucleotide synthesis, non-nucleosidic linkers or nucleoside succinates are covalently {{attached to the}} reactive amino groups in aminopropyl CPG, LCAA CPG, or aminomethyl MPPS. The remaining unreacted amino groups <b>are</b> <b>capped</b> with acetic anhydride. Typically, three conceptually different groups of solid supports are used.|$|E
5|$|Wynnea {{americana}} {{is distinguished}} from other {{species in the}} genus Wynnea by the pustules (small bumps) on the outer surface, and microscopically by the large asymmetrical longitudinally ribbed spores with a sharply pointed tip. The spores are made in structures called asci, which have thickened rings at one end that <b>are</b> <b>capped</b> by a hinged structure known as the operculum—a lid that is opened when spores are {{to be released from}} the ascus.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} feature of English cathedrals, uncommon elsewhere except in Normandy, is the large and often elaborate square central tower over the crossing. The larger of these towers range from 55 metres (182ft) at Wells to 82.5 metres (271ft) at Lincoln. The central tower may exist as a single feature as at Salisbury, Gloucester, Worcester, Norwich and Chichester or in combination with paired towers at the west front as at York, Lincoln, Canterbury, Durham and Wells. Among the cathedrals that have three towers, the central tower is usually much the tallest. At Southwell the two western towers <b>are</b> <b>capped</b> by pyramidal spires sheathed in lead.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to that, other players <b>were</b> <b>capped</b> or <b>are</b> under {{consideration of the}} team management to <b>be</b> <b>capped</b> during the year 2016.|$|R

50|$|Length {{of service}} <b>is</b> <b>capped</b> at 20 years and weekly pay <b>is</b> <b>capped</b> at £475. The {{maximum amount of}} {{statutory}} redundancy pay is £14,250.|$|R
5|$|In meteorology, {{the trade}} winds {{act as the}} {{steering}} flow for tropical storms that form over the Atlantic, Pacific, and southern Indian Oceans and make landfall in North America, Southeast Asia, and Madagascar and eastern Africa, respectively. Trade winds also transport African dust westward across the Atlantic Ocean into the Caribbean Sea, as well as portions of southeastern North America. Shallow cumulus clouds are seen within trade wind regimes, and <b>are</b> <b>capped</b> from becoming taller by a trade wind inversion, which is caused by descending air aloft from within the subtropical ridge. The weaker the trade winds become, the more rainfall can be expected in the neighboring landmasses.|$|E
5|$|The {{gatehouse}} {{was built}} by the Campbells in the late 15th century, replacing an earlier round tower in the east corner. It {{takes the form of}} a four-storey harled tower house, with the entrance passage running through half the vaulted basement, the other half forming guard rooms with arrow slits facing the gate. The present approach to the gate is by a stone stair, replacing an earlier drawbridge. The tower was remodelled in the 18th century to provide reception rooms and a private suite. The dormer windows at the top <b>are</b> <b>capped</b> by the pediments from the 1725 house (see below), and bear the date, the Campbell arms, and the initials AEC and DLC, for Aeneas Campbell, 11th Captain, and his wife Dame Lilias. The pediments were moved here during the 1903 restoration works.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} {{gates and}} wall separating the gardens {{from the park}} and farmland date from 1878 and are listed at grade II. The wrought-iron gates are by Cubitt & Co., and were exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1878. Two outer single gates and a double inner gate are supported by four sandstone piers. The outer pair of gate piers <b>are</b> <b>capped</b> by a bud-shaped device supported on scrolls; the inner pair are surmounted by a griffin and a lion, mirroring the statuary of the hall's terraces. The lower gate sections of lyre-like panels with leaf and spearhead motifs are topped with Jacobean-style arched panels. The ornate gate overthrows include shields and emblems capped with crowns, sheaves and sickles. The inner gates bear the inscription Quid retribuam domino ("What can I render to the Lord?"), while the outer gates bear the date. The wall, of brick with stone dressings, features arcading and has piers surmounted with ogee caps carved to match the tiles of the main hall tower. A further feature of the gardens to survive is a grade-II-listed sundial dating from the early 19th century, which stands {{to the rear of}} the house.|$|E
5000|$|He <b>was</b> <b>capped</b> for [...] {{ten times}} from 1950 to 1953, playing in nine Five Nations matches. He <b>was</b> <b>capped</b> at Centre and Wing.|$|R

5000|$|Charles Reid, nicknamed Hippo, was a Scottish {{international}} rugby player. He <b>was</b> <b>capped</b> {{twenty times}} for [...] between 1881-88. Reid vies with Ninian Finlay {{for the title}} of the youngest player ever to <b>be</b> <b>capped</b> for [...] - he was seventeen years and thirty six days old when he <b>was</b> <b>capped</b> against [...] on 19 February 1881; however, Reid had lived through an extra leap year day, when he <b>was</b> <b>capped</b> in 1881, so Finlay generally gets that title. He played at second row/lock.|$|R
25|$|Spectators {{at first}} XI matches are often {{required}} to pay for entry and a programme. The League management has, from 2008, capped the maximum charge at £3, with concessions at £1.50. Second XI matches <b>are</b> <b>capped</b> at a maximum of 25p for adults and 10p for children. All gate receipts are kept by the home club.|$|E
25|$|The area is {{underlain}} by Carboniferous coal measures, which <b>are</b> <b>capped</b> by glacial {{deposits of}} varying thickness. Spring-lines are prominent {{on the lower}} valley slopes and {{have a significant effect}} on the vegetation. The soils are predominantly gley and acidic, well-drained and covered with a thin peaty layer on the higher ground, wetter and with a deeper layer of peat in less well-drained areas.|$|E
25|$|A fire hoop {{consists}} of a hoop with one to six spokes radiating outward. The spokes typically extend 6-8inches from the connection points on the hoop, and <b>are</b> <b>capped</b> with a roll of cotton and Kevlar wicking, which can then be lit. This design keeps the fire a fair distance from the hooper's body. Any skill where fire is a component risks {{injury to the person}} doing it.|$|E
5000|$|Ninian Jamieson Finlay (31 January 1858-7 March 1936) was a Scottish {{international}} rugby player.

25|$|Two pavilions {{occupy the}} east and west ends of the cross axis, one the mirror of the other. In the classic charbargh design, gates would have been located in this location. In the Taj they provide {{punctuation}} and access to the long enclosing wall with its decorative crenellations. Built of sandstone, they are given a tripartite form and over two storeys and <b>are</b> <b>capped</b> with a white marble chhatris supported from 8 columns.|$|E
25|$|Since 2008 all LNZCC players <b>are</b> <b>capped</b> with ‘Nottman Caps’ {{once they}} have played five games. The Nottman Cap is named after Harold Nottman {{who was one of}} LNZCC's longest-serving playing members (from the 1950s to the 1990s no less) and a notable {{administrator}} in the club's history. One of his finest days on the cricket field for LNZCC was against Ripley Cricket Club when he took nine wickets in a match.|$|E
25|$|Devil's Den State Park {{is in the}} Lee Creek Valley of the Boston Mountains {{which are}} part of The Ozarks. The area is a high and deeply {{dissected}} plateau in northern Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma. The rocks of the region are essentially little disturbed, flat-lying sedimentary layers of the Paleozoic age. The highest ridges and peaks <b>are</b> <b>capped</b> by Pennsylvanian sandstone and shale. The deeply eroded valleys are cut into Mississippian limestones and below that layer Ordovician dolomites.|$|E
50|$|His {{younger brother}} Dave <b>was</b> also <b>capped</b> for Scotland, and his {{youngest}} brother Rob Valentine <b>was</b> <b>capped</b> for South of Scotland both brothers <b>were</b> subsequently <b>capped</b> at rugby league for Great Britain.|$|R
5000|$|James Alexander Campbell (1 July 1858 in Lake Athabasca, Canada - 20 June 1902 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) was a Canadian-born rugby {{player who}} {{represented}} [...] at international level.

25|$|The {{building}} is on a triangular footprint plot, {{a challenge for}} the designer. It displays a nice bay window on the corner facade. The first floor windows, around the bay-window are more adorned than others with flanking pilasters topped with corbels and a frieze of ornaments. The second floors windows <b>are</b> <b>capped</b> by triangular pediments and have also small corbels and pilasters. The 3rd level openings are only flanked by clean pilasters and pediment topped. A line of designed corbels runs beneath the roof.|$|E
25|$|Where {{the towers}} are founded on {{underwater}} piers, caissons are sunk and any soft bottom is excavated for a foundation. If the bedrock is too deep {{to be exposed}} by excavation or the sinking of a caisson, pilings are driven to the bedrock or into overlying hard soil, or a large concrete pad to distribute the weight over less resistant soil may be constructed, first preparing the surface with a bed of compacted gravel. (Such a pad footing can also accommodate the movements of an active fault, {{and this has been}} implemented on the foundations of the cable-stayed Rio-Antirio bridge.) The piers are then extended above water level, where they <b>are</b> <b>capped</b> with pedestal bases for the towers.|$|E
25|$|The RNA {{segments}} of the viral genome have complementary base sequences at the terminal ends, allowing them to bond to each other with hydrogen bonds. After transcription from negative-sense to positive-sense RNA takes place, the positive-sense RNA strands <b>are</b> <b>capped</b> on the 5’ end by a process called cap snatching. This involves the viral protein NS1 binding to the host cell’s early messenger RNA transcripts. A second viral protein, PA, cleaves the cap from the host’s RNA. The short cap is then added to the influenza positive-sense RNA strands, allowing it to be processed by ribosomes and translated into its protein products. The positive-sense RNA strands also serve for synthesis of negative-sense RNA strands for new virions.|$|E
50|$|Dokken <b>was</b> <b>capped</b> {{once for}} Norway boys team, four {{times for the}} Norway u-19 and 11 times for Norway u-21. He <b>was</b> <b>capped</b> 24 times for the Norway {{national}} football team scoring two goals.|$|R
