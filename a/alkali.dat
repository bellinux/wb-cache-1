5|$|The <b>alkali</b> metals are all shiny, soft, highly {{reactive}} metals at standard temperature and pressure and readily lose their outermost electron to form cations with charge +1. They {{can all be}} cut easily with a knife due to their softness, exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation by atmospheric moisture and oxygen (and {{in the case of}} lithium, nitrogen). Because of their high reactivity, they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air, and are found naturally only in salts and never as the free elements. Caesium, the fifth <b>alkali</b> metal, is the most reactive of all the metals. In the modern IUPAC nomenclature, the <b>alkali</b> metals comprise the group 1 elements, excluding hydrogen (H), which is nominally a group 1 element but not normally considered to be an <b>alkali</b> metal as it rarely exhibits behaviour comparable to that of the <b>alkali</b> metals. All the <b>alkali</b> metals react with water, with the heavier <b>alkali</b> metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones.|$|E
5|$|The <b>alkali</b> metals {{dissolve}} {{slowly in}} liquid ammonia, forming ammoniacal solutions of solvated M+ and e−, which {{react to form}} hydrogen gas and the <b>alkali</b> metal amide (MNH2, where M represents an <b>alkali</b> metal): this was first noted by Humphry Davy in 1809 and rediscovered by W. Weyl in 1864. The process may be speeded up by a catalyst. Similar solutions are formed by the heavy divalent alkaline earth metals calcium, strontium, barium, {{as well as the}} divalent lanthanides, europium and ytterbium. The amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution, leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the <b>alkali</b> metals. In 1907, Charles Krause identified the colour as being due to the presence of solvated electrons, which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions. At low concentrations (below 3 M), the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous sodium chloride; at higher concentrations (above 3 M), the solution is copper-coloured and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like mercury. In addition to the <b>alkali</b> metal amide salt and solvated electrons, such ammonia solutions also contain the <b>alkali</b> metal cation (M+), the neutral <b>alkali</b> metal atom (M), diatomic <b>alkali</b> metal molecules (M2) and <b>alkali</b> metal anions (M−). These are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable <b>alkali</b> metal amide and hydrogen gas. Solvated electrons are powerful reducing agents and are often used in chemical synthesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of pure <b>alkali</b> metals is somewhat complicated {{due to their}} extreme reactivity with commonly used substances, such as water. From their silicate ores, all the stable <b>alkali</b> metals may be obtained the same way: sulfuric acid is first used to dissolve the desired <b>alkali</b> metal ion and aluminium(III) ions from the ore (leaching), whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the hydroxide. The remaining insoluble <b>alkali</b> metal carbonate is then precipitated selectively; the salt is then dissolved in hydrochloric acid to produce the chloride. The result is then left to evaporate and the <b>alkali</b> metal can then be isolated. Lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides, with calcium chloride typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture. The heavier <b>alkali</b> metals, however, is more typically isolated in a different way, where a reducing agent (typically sodium for potassium and magnesium or calcium for the heaviest <b>alkali</b> metals) is used to reduce the <b>alkali</b> metal chloride. The liquid or gaseous product (the <b>alkali</b> metal) then undergoes fractional distillation for purification.|$|E

It {{is obtained}} by hydrolysis of cocaine with acids or <b>alkalis,</b> and crystallizes with one molecule of water, the crystals melting at 198-199 °C. It is levorotary, and on warming with <b>alkalis</b> gives iso-ecgonine, which is dextrorotary.|$|R
50|$|Trifluoroacetyl {{chloride}} {{is incompatible}} {{with a number of}} other varieties of chemicals, such as amines, alcohols, <b>alkalis,</b> and strong oxidizers. It reacts strongly with amines and <b>alkalis.</b> It also reacts violently with diisopropyl ether, or any ether if metal salts are present, sometimes causing an explosion.|$|R
50|$|<b>Alkalis</b> {{convert it}} into acetic acid and formaldehyde.|$|R
5|$|<b>Alkali</b> metal cations do {{not usually}} form {{coordination}} complexes with simple Lewis bases {{due to their}} low charge of just +1 and their relatively large size; thus the Li+ ion forms most complexes and the heavier <b>alkali</b> metal ions form less and less (though exceptions occur for weak complexes). Lithium in particular has a very rich coordination chemistry in which it exhibits coordination numbers from 1 to 12, although octahedral hexacoordination is its preferred mode. In aqueous solution, the <b>alkali</b> metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes (+), {{with the exception of}} the lithium ion, which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes (+); the <b>alkali</b> metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules. Because of this, anhydrous salts containing <b>alkali</b> metal cations are often used as desiccants. <b>Alkali</b> metals also readily form complexes with crown ethers (e.g. 12-crown-4 for Li+, 15-crown-5 for Na+, 18-crown-6 for K+, and 21-crown-7 for Rb+) and cryptands due to electrostatic attraction.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alkali</b> metal selenides {{react with}} {{selenium}} to form polyselenides, , which exist as chains.|$|E
5|$|All the <b>alkali</b> metals {{are highly}} {{reactive}} and are never found in elemental forms in nature. Because of this, {{they are usually}} stored in mineral oil or kerosene (paraffin oil). They react aggressively with the halogens to form the <b>alkali</b> metal halides, which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble in water except lithium fluoride (LiF). The <b>alkali</b> metals also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should be handled with great care. The heavier <b>alkali</b> metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones; for example, when dropped into water, caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium if {{the same number of}} moles of each metal is used. The <b>alkali</b> metals have the lowest first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain a noble gas configuration by losing just one electron. Not only do the <b>alkali</b> metals react with water, but also with proton donors like alcohols and phenols, gaseous ammonia, and alkynes, the last demonstrating the phenomenal degree of their reactivity. Their great power as reducing agents makes them very useful in liberating other metals from their oxides or halides.|$|E

30|$|In {{the case}} of <b>alkalis,</b> SiO 2 phase {{certainly}} contributes {{to the development of}} porosity, {{but there is also a}} significant reconstruction of carbon phase because of its interaction with <b>alkalis.</b> That is why a detection of the contribution of SiO 2 phase in the porosity development is complicated enough.|$|R
5|$|All the <b>alkali</b> metals react readily with {{phosphorus}} and arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides {{with the}} formula M3Pn (where M represents an <b>alkali</b> metal and Pn represents a pnictogen – phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth). This {{is due to}} the greater size of the P3− and As3− ions, so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form. These are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the <b>alkali</b> metals: for example, potassium has nine different known phosphides, with formulae K3P, K4P3, K5P4, KP, K4P6, K3P7, K3P11, KP10.3, and KP15. While most metals form arsenides, only the <b>alkali</b> and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides. The structure of Na3As is complex with unusually short Na–Na distances of 328–330 pm which are shorter than in sodium metal, and this indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding cannot be straightforwardly ionic. Other <b>alkali</b> metal arsenides not conforming to the formula M3As are known, such as LiAs, which has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some metallic bonding. The antimonides are unstable and reactive as the Sb3− ion is a strong reducing agent; reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas stibine (SbH3). Indeed, they have some metallic properties, and the <b>alkali</b> metal antimonides of stoichiometry MSb involve antimony atoms bonded in a spiral Zintl structure. Bismuthides are not even wholly ionic; they are intermetallic compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds.|$|E
5|$|All the <b>alkali</b> metals react vigorously or explosively {{with cold}} water, {{producing}} an aqueous solution of a strongly basic <b>alkali</b> metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas. This reaction becomes more vigorous {{going down the}} group: lithium reacts steadily with effervescence, but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers. When an <b>alkali</b> metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, {{of which there are}} two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier <b>alkali</b> metals. Second, the heat generated by {{the first part of the}} reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water). The <b>alkali</b> metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides.|$|E
5|$|Although {{francium}} is {{the heaviest}} <b>alkali</b> metal {{that has been}} discovered, {{there has been some}} theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of the hypothetical heavier <b>alkali</b> metals. Being the first period 8 element, the undiscovered element ununennium (element 119) is predicted to be the next <b>alkali</b> metal after francium and behave much like their lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter <b>alkali</b> metals in some properties. Its chemistry is predicted to be closer to that of potassium or rubidium instead of caesium or francium. This is unusual as periodic trends, ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium. This lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron, increasing ununennium's first ionisation energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii; this effect is already seen for francium. This assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an <b>alkali</b> metal, which, although likely, may not be true due to relativistic effects. The relativistic stabilisation of the 8s orbital also increases ununennium's electron affinity far beyond that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the <b>alkali</b> metals lighter than it. Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarisability of ununennium. On the other hand, ununennium is predicted to continue the trend of melting points decreasing going down the group, being expected to have a melting point between 0°C and 30°C.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the higher}} {{electronegativity}} of lithium, some of its compounds have a more covalent character. For example, lithium iodide (LiI) will dissolve in organic solvents, a property of most covalent compounds. Lithium fluoride (LiF) is the only <b>alkali</b> halide that is not soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) is the only <b>alkali</b> metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the first}} period 8 element, ununennium is {{predicted}} to be an <b>alkali</b> metal, below lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium. Each of these elements has one valence electron in the outermost s-orbital (valence electron configuration ns1), which is easily lost in chemical reactions to form the +1 oxidation state: thus the <b>alkali</b> metals are very reactive elements. Ununennium is predicted to continue the trend and have a valence electron configuration of 8s1. It is therefore expected to behave much like its lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter <b>alkali</b> metals in some properties.|$|E
5|$|Boron is {{a special}} case, being the only nonmetal in group 13. The <b>alkali</b> metal borides tend to be boron-rich, {{involving}} appreciable boron–boron bonding involving deltahedral structures, and are thermally unstable due to the <b>alkali</b> metals having a very high vapour pressure at elevated temperatures. This makes direct synthesis problematic because the <b>alkali</b> metals do not react with boron below 700°C, and thus this must be accomplished in sealed containers with the <b>alkali</b> metal in excess. Furthermore, exceptionally in this group, reactivity with boron decreases down the group: lithium reacts completely at 700°C, but sodium at 900°C and potassium not until 1200°C, and the reaction is instantaneous for lithium but takes hours for potassium. Rubidium and caesium borides have not even been characterised. Various phases are known, such as LiB10, NaB6, NaB15, and KB6. Under high pressure the boron–boron bonding in the lithium borides changes from following Wade's rules to forming Zintl anions {{like the rest of}} group 13.|$|E

5|$|Hydrogen, {{like the}} <b>alkali</b> metals, has one valence {{electron}} and reacts easily with the halogens, but the similarities end {{there because of}} the small size of a bare proton H+ compared to the <b>alkali</b> metal cations. Its placement above lithium is primarily due to its electron configuration. It is sometimes placed above carbon due to their similar electronegativities or fluorine due to their similar chemical properties.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{fluoride}} is {{the only}} <b>alkali</b> metal halide that is poorly soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide {{is the only}} <b>alkali</b> metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent. Conversely, lithium perchlorate and other lithium salts with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other <b>alkali</b> metals, probably because Li+ has a high solvation energy. This effect also means that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form, because the anhydrous forms are extremely hygroscopic: this allows salts like lithium chloride and lithium bromide {{to be used in}} dehumidifiers and air-conditioners.|$|E
5|$|Pure <b>alkali</b> metals are dangerously {{reactive}} {{with air}} and water and must be kept away from heat, fire, oxidising agents, acids, most organic compounds, halocarbons, plastics, and moisture. They also react with carbon dioxide and carbon tetrachloride, so that normal fire extinguishers are counterproductive when used on <b>alkali</b> metal fires. Some Class D dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are effective, depriving the fire of oxygen and cooling the <b>alkali</b> metal.|$|E

5|$|The Uue–Au bond {{should be}} the weakest of all bonds between gold and an <b>alkali</b> metal, but should still be stable. This gives {{extrapolated}} medium-sized adsorption enthalpies (−ΔHads) of 106kJ·mol−1 on gold (the francium value should be 136kJ·mol−1), 76kJ·mol−1 on platinum, and 63kJ·mol−1 on silver, the smallest of all the <b>alkali</b> metals, that demonstrate {{that it would be}} feasible to study the chromatographic adsorption of ununennium onto surfaces made of noble metals. The enthalpy of adsorption of ununennium on a Teflon surface is predicted to be 17.6kJ·mol−1, which would be the lowest among the <b>alkali</b> metals: this information would be very useful for future chemistry experiments on ununennium. The ΔHsub and −ΔHads values are not proportionally related for the <b>alkali</b> metals, as they change in opposite directions as atomic number increases.|$|E
5|$|The <b>alkali</b> metals {{all have}} the same crystal {{structure}} (body-centred cubic) and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms, since density is defined as mass per unit volume. The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius, which increases going down the group; thus, the volume of an <b>alkali</b> metal atom increases going down the group. The mass of an <b>alkali</b> metal atom also increases going down the group. Thus, the trend for the densities of the <b>alkali</b> metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii; if figures for these two factors are known, the ratios between the densities of the <b>alkali</b> metals can then be calculated. The resultant trend is that the densities of the <b>alkali</b> metals increase down the table, with an exception at potassium. Due to having the lowest atomic weight of all the elements in their period and having the largest atomic radius for their periods, the <b>alkali</b> metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table. Lithium, sodium, and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water: in fact, lithium is the least dense known solid at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|The <b>alkali</b> metals also react {{similarly}} with hydrogen to form ionic <b>alkali</b> metal hydrides, {{where the}} hydride anion {{acts as a}} pseudohalide: these are often used as reducing agents, producing hydrides, complex metal hydrides, or hydrogen gas. Other pseudohalides are also known, notably the cyanides. These are isostructural to the respective halides except for lithium cyanide, indicating that the cyanide ions may rotate freely. Ternary <b>alkali</b> metal halide oxides, such as Na3ClO, K3BrO (yellow), Na4Br2O, Na4I2O, and K4Br2O, are also known.
