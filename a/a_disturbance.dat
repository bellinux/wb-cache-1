5|$|<b>A</b> <b>disturbance</b> in the South Indian {{convergence}} zone near Seychelles persisted on October24 with {{an area of}} convection. It gradually organized while passing near Agaléga. On October27, it developed into a tropical depression, and after Dvorak classifications of 2.5, the system was named Arilisy. It became disorganized on October29, never having intensified beyond winds of 50km/h (30mph). After moving to the southwest for much of its duration, Arilisy dissipated on October30.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>disturbance</b> in the Indian Ocean {{intertropical}} {{convergence zone}} became evident southeast of the Chagos Archipelago on March16 after two cyclones {{moved away from the}} region. Based on analysis from MF, the system slowly organized while moving westward, its movement influenced by a subtropical ridge to the south. On March17, the JTWC also began tracking the system. Due to cool, dry air, the system initially did not intensify, although its passage over warmer sea surface temperatures on March19 allowed for strengthening. On March19, MF classified the disturbance as Tropical Storm Nadia after rainbands developed. A day later, the JTWC designated Nadia as Tropical Cyclone 23S.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>disturbance</b> {{possibly}} {{associated with}} a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on October 22. It strengthened into a tropical storm that same day and a hurricane on October 23. The next day, Kenna became the third Category5 hurricane of the season. A trough over Mexico recurved the hurricane, and it started accelerating towards Mexico. Despite moving over waters that were still warm, wind shear weakened the system to a minimal Category4 {{by the time of}} its landfall over Mexico late on October 25. Mountainous terrain rapidly weakened Kenna, and the system dissipated early on October 26.|$|E
5|$|Around AD 30, Jesus and his {{followers}} traveled from Galilee to Jerusalem to observe Passover. Jesus caused <b>a</b> <b>disturbance</b> in the Second Temple, which {{was the center of}} Jewish religious and civil authority. Sanders associates it with Jesus' prophecy that the Temple would be totally demolished. Jesus had a last meal with his disciples, which is the origin of the Christian sacrament of bread and wine. Jesus' words are recorded in the Synoptics and in Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians. The differences in the accounts cannot be completely reconciled, and {{it is impossible to know}} what Jesus intended, but in general the meal seems to point forward to the coming Kingdom. Jesus probably expected to be killed, and he may have hoped that God would intervene.|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} about the {{dynamics}} of the Hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom, in the presence of <b>a</b> low-frequency <b>disturbance.</b> It is proved that <b>a</b> low-frequency <b>disturbance</b> induces <b>a</b> stochastic instability.

This instability is a new mechanism of transformation of low-frequency oscillation energy to a energy of high-frequency oscillation. As examples of the parametric instability development in distributed systems, we have examined the possibility of the parametric amplification of the x-ray radiation emission in crystals and the possibility of the parametric amplification of the waves propagating in gyrotropic media...|$|R

5|$|Based on {{analysis}} from Météo-France (MFR), <b>a</b> <b>disturbance</b> in the Indian Ocean {{intertropical convergence zone}} became evident south of the Chagos Archipelago on February6, after Cyclone Geralda struck Madagascar and {{moved away from the}} region. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed it as developing a day prior in the same general area. Later on February6, a circulation developed concurrently with an area of organized convection. On February8, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Hollanda as it moved southwestward, its motion influenced by a ridge to its south. A trough turned the storm to the south-southwest, and Hollanda intensified into a tropical cyclone– the equivalence of a hurricane– on February9.|$|E

Police also found a plastic bag with small amounts of cocaine on her person. She was found guilty of the assault and fined HK$9,000 (US$1,153). She was held not guilty of cocaine possession because of doubts over the evidence.|$|E
5|$|Early on November 20, the JTWC {{reported}} that a tropical depression had developed. Shortly thereafter, MFR {{reported that}} a tropical disturbance had formed. The low moved west-southwest while gradually deepening. Late on November 20, MFR upgraded the system into a moderate tropical storm. The storm failed to intensify further as it had moved onshore northern Madagascar. By November 21, MFR estimated that the storm weakened back into <b>a</b> <b>disturbance.</b> After emerging into the Mozambique Channel, Anety reportedly re-intensified back to moderate tropical storm status. While making its closest approach to the African mainland, the storm resumed weakening while turning back southeast. On November 23, both agencies stopped monitoring the system.|$|E

5|$|Ecosystems are {{regularly}} confronted with natural environmental variations and disturbances {{over time and}} geographic space. <b>A</b> <b>disturbance</b> is any process that removes biomass from a community, such as a fire, flood, drought, or predation. Disturbances occur over vastly different ranges in terms of magnitudes as well as distances and time periods, and are both the cause and product of natural fluctuations in death rates, species assemblages, and biomass densities within an ecological community. These disturbances create places of renewal where new directions emerge from the patchwork of natural experimentation and opportunity. Ecological resilience is a cornerstone theory in ecosystem management. Biodiversity fuels the resilience of ecosystems acting {{as a kind of}} regenerative insurance.|$|E
5|$|In early August, <b>a</b> <b>disturbance</b> was {{observed}} in satellite images moving {{off the coast of}} Africa on August 4. Moving westward along the Intertropical Convergence Zone at a forward speed of roughly , the disturbance showed no signs of development until a cloud mass broke away from the ITCZ on August 6. The separated mass began rapidly organizing, becoming Tropical Depression Three late on August 7. The tropical depression continued to gain organization and was upgraded to a tropical storm on August 8, receiving the name Cora.|$|E
5|$|In early December, the ITCZ spawned {{an area of}} {{convection}} {{near the}} boundary between the south-west Indian and Australian regions. On December8, the MFR estimated that <b>a</b> <b>disturbance</b> formed just within the Australian region, which entered this basin on December9. After the convection developed into a central dense overcast, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Elvina on December10. Later that day, the MFR estimated peak 10minute winds of 85km/h (50mph). On December11, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 100km/h (65mph). By that time, Elvina had been moving steadily west-southwestward, although the storm slowed on December12. A polar trough caused the storm to accelerate to the southwest on December14 while simultaneously increasing wind shear, causing weakening. On December16, Elvina dissipated well to the south of Diego Garcia.|$|E
