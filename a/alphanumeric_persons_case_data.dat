40|$|Research {{into the}} topic of missing <b>person</b> <b>cases</b> in Canada {{indicates}} a gap between understanding the complete extent of this issue and the police response to such cases. Within the Canadian policing community, {{it is evident that}} there is a consensus regarding the value in developing a national missing persons program that would include a national database, a national public website, streamlined policies and investigational procedures, and strategic partnerships. However, it is not yet clear how such a program would be developed and sustained. Presently, there exist isolated Provincial responses to this most important topic. This major paper will focus on the Province of Alberta and examine the extent of uncleared missing <b>person</b> <b>cases</b> and the associated police responses. This research commenced with a review of available statistics on uncleared missing <b>persons</b> <b>cases</b> in Alberta in an effort to provide an accurate reflection of the current state of uncleared missing <b>persons</b> <b>cases</b> in the Province. The research then examined the associated police responses and concluded with a discussion centering on the matter of how police respond to missing <b>persons</b> <b>cases</b> in Alberta. Recommendations from this paper have already been implemented in Alberta and others are being further considered for use across Canada...|$|R

40|$|This volume {{has been}} {{developed}} to identify the most current information regarding missing persons. While information is generally available regarding missing children cases, the book includes material on missing elders, missing adults, and human trafficking cases. Acknowledging the limited research in the field, the contributors use cases featuring children to underscore larger points regarding all missing <b>persons</b> <b>cases.</b> It is hoped that this work will trigger further research and exploration of these areas. Perspectives on Missing <b>Persons</b> <b>Cases</b> includes not only professional, academic, and statistical information, but personal narratives as well. Throughout the book the reader will find experiential chapters authored by victims and their families. The highly personal accounts of their journeys can aid the professional in serving victims in a comprehensive manner sensitive to {{the unique needs of}} a missing <b>persons</b> <b>case.</b> [URL]...|$|R
