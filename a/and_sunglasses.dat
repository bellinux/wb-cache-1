Edna Mode's similar hairstyle in The Incredibles has been noted, Johnny Depp said he partially based the demeanour of Willy Wonka in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory on Wintour. Fey Sommers in the Ugly Betty television series was also likened to Wintour, from the trademark bob <b>and</b> <b>sunglasses,</b> to Wintour's last name homophonous with 'Winter', while Sommers' is homophonous with 'Summer'.|$|E

Narula gave Bachachan cargo and embroidered pants <b>and</b> <b>sunglasses.</b> The embroidery, primarily dragons and palm trees, conveyed a tropical summer look.|$|E
5|$|At about 9:20am on Saturday 15 June 1996, the Ford van {{was parked}} on Corporation Street, outside the Marks & Spencer store, near the Arndale Centre. After setting the bomb's timer, two men – wearing hooded jackets, {{baseball}} caps <b>and</b> <b>sunglasses</b> – left {{the vehicle and}} walked to Cathedral Street, where a third man picked {{them up in the}} Ford Granada. The truck had been parked on double yellow lines with its hazard lights flashing. Within three minutes a traffic warden had issued the vehicle with a parking ticket and called for its removal. At about 9:40am, Granada Studios on Quay Street received a telephone call claiming that there was a bomb at the corner of Corporation Street and Cannon Street and that it would explode in one hour. The caller had an Irish accent and gave an IRA codeword so that police would know the threat was genuine. Four other telephoned warnings were sent to television/radio stations, newspapers and a hospital.|$|E

5|$|In the song's music video, Trainor sings into a red {{microphone}} {{in front of}} a pastel blue wall. She is sometimes flanked by backup dancers and television screens. Lips are used as a motif throughout the video; they appear as closeups of Trainor's mouth and as a large drawing of lips used as a backdrop. Yahoo! Music writer Lyndsey Parker compared the video to the poster for The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Trainor wears lip-shaped earrings <b>and</b> <b>sunglasses</b> in the video, and is seen reclining on a lip-shaped sofa. Parker compared the sofa in the video to the sofas used in the American television program So You Think You Can Dance. The video's set changes constantly; props are lifted on-and-off screen by workers throughout the clip.|$|E
5|$|When {{the chorus}} of the song begins, two women pull Gaga out of the bathtub, rip her top {{clothing}} off and force her to drink a glass of vodka. As the second verse begins, Gaga, wearing a diamond-covered outfit topped with a crown, seductively dances {{for a group of}} men bidding for her. She straddles one of the men, played by Slovenian model Jurij Bradač, and performs a lap dance for him. Afterwards, the man raises his bid and becomes the highest bidder for her. When the chorus is played for the third time, Gaga is shown wearing a faux-polar bear hide jacket. She walks towards the man, who is sitting on a bed and unbuttoning his shirt, while drinking a glass of vodka. Gaga has a look of indifference on her face and removes her jacket <b>and</b> <b>sunglasses.</b> Suddenly, the bed spontaneously combusts with the man still sitting on it, and Gaga sings in a sinister way in front of the flames. The video ends with her lying beside a smoldering skeleton, on top of the destroyed bed, covered in ashes. With soot smeared across her body, she calmly smokes a cigarette while her pyrotechnic bra activates.|$|E

25|$|Activists {{have accused}} {{some of the}} anti-balloon drop protesters of being paid counter-protesters {{supported}} and organized by the North Korean state. However, there is genuine opposition against the launches in the wider South Korean society, beyond the locals near the launch sites. Some counter-protesters object to provoking a nuclear state, and believe that a dialogue with North Korean leadership is needed for the reunification of the Korean peninsula. As some defectors dress in military-style uniforms <b>and</b> <b>sunglasses,</b> {{this has been a}} point for objections.
