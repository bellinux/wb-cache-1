Method: The Francis Scale of <b>Attitude</b> <b>toward</b> Alcohol (Francis, 1992 c.

40|$|Abstract. Attitude {{has been}} understudied in the {{information}} systems (IS) field. Research interest in attitude has gone through ups and downs {{due to the lack}} of predictability of attitude for behavioral intention on using ICT. In this paper, we first clarify both conceptual and operational confusions on attitudes that may have caused the inconsistent and inconclusive results. Two different types of <b>attitudes,</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> object and <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> behavior, are defined and their structures are discussed. Then we propose a theoretical model that details the relationships among <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> object, <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> behavior, and behavioral intention both for initial ICT use stage and for continued ICT use stage. A longitudinal study with mandatory use of a course management system is conducted. Results show that <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> behavior is a strong predictor of intention; <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> object (ICT) influences intention indirectly through <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> behavior; and intention during initial use has a strong positive effect on intention during continued use. In addition, the roles of previous attitudes on current attitudes are dependent on whether the current attitudes are about initial use or continued use...|$|R

We also considered whether such change could provide evidence regarding causal direction; causation could go in either of two directions between the two attitudes, or it could even be bi-directional. Results. – We corroborated the substantive connection between <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> nature and <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> environmental protection; however, the absence of change in the attitudes despite the passage of two years disallows reliable statements about causal direction.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Products {{as diverse}} as soda-pop, fashion and {{automobiles}} are selling to the tunes of classic and current pop and rock music. The combination of MTV (Music Television), the latest audio-visual technology, and the replacement of movie stars by rock stars as the idols of contemporary youth (Beckett, 1985; Hartman, 1987), are responsible for today's successful marketing-through-music concept. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate the effect of music in fashion video advertisements on <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> an apparel brand. Specifically, this study investigated the effect of the emotion-arousing quality or capacity of music on <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> apparel brand and <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> a fashion video advertisement. Congruity Theory (Osgood & Tannenbaum, 1955), prior research on the effect of <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> an advertisement on brand attitude, and the persuasive aspect of advertising communication served as the conceptual and theoretical framework for this study. In addition, the emotion arousing quality of music as a persuasive element of advertising communication was applied to the Holbrook and Batra communication model (1987), and served as a model for this study. A pretest-posttest-control group experiment was conducted for this study. The pretest measure consisted of: 1. a measure of <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> apparel brand and 2. a measure of the emotion-arousing capacity of music and preference for music. <b>Attitude</b> <b>toward</b> apparel brand and <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> music were measured on a seven-point semantic differential scale. The posttest consisted of the same two measures as the pretest as well as a third measure, <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> fashion video advertisement. <b>Attitude</b> <b>toward</b> fashion video advertisement was measured on a five-point Likert-type scale. The subjects for this study were recruited from a course in the Department of Apparel, Interiors, and Merchandising at Oregon State University. Fifty-nine students participated in the pretest portion of the study and forty-seven students completed all three phases of the experiment (pretest, exposure to fashion video, and posttest). Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 27 years, with a mean age of 20 years. Factor analysis, one-way analysis of variance, paired t-test, unpaired. t -test, Pearson Correlation, and analysis of covariance were used to analyze the data. As hypothesized, results indicated that <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> apparel brand was affected by the type of music associated with an apparel brand in the context of a fashion video advertisement. It was found that an initial neutral <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> apparel brand became more positive after an association with emotion-evoking music, and no significant change in <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> apparel brand was found exposure to a fashion video advertisement without However, contrary to prediction, it was found after music. that an association between apparel brand and non-emotion-evoking music did not have a negative effect on <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> apparel brand. This association resulted in a more positive <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> apparel brand. It was also predicted that the type of music used in a fashion video advertisement would affect <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> the advertisement. Results indicated that the type of music did not affect <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> fashion video advertisement.
