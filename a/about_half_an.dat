5|$|On June 25, 2017, Metro {{changed its}} hours of {{operation}} with closing at 11:30 PM Monday–Thursday, 1 AM on Friday and Saturday, and 11 PM on Sunday, with the last trains leaving the end stations inbound <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour before these times.|$|E
5|$|At 10:45, the scuttling charge detonated {{in the bow}} and {{exploded}} the forward ammunition magazines. The bow was badly mangled; in <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour, the ship had taken on enough water to sink. As it struck the sea floor, the bow was torn {{from the rest of}} the ship, which rolled over to starboard. As the rest of the hull settled below the waves, a second scuttling charge exploded in the ship's engine rooms.|$|E
5|$|The Daily Show {{typically}} tapes {{four new}} episodes a week, Monday through Thursday, forty-two weeks a year. The show is broadcast at 11 PM Eastern/10 PM Central, {{a time when}} local television stations show their news reports and <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour before most other late-night comedy programs begin {{to go on the}} air. The program is rerun several times the next day, including a 7:30 PM Eastern/6:30 PM Central prime time broadcast.|$|E

5|$|Aware of the {{military}} importance of Jersey, the British government had ordered that the island be heavily fortified. On 6 January 1781, a French invasion force of 2,000 men set out {{to take over the}} island, but only half of the force arrived and landed. The Battle of Jersey lasted <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour, with Britain successfully defending the island. There were about thirty casualties on each side, and the British took 600 French prisoners whom were subsequently sent to England. Both British and French commanders were slain.|$|E
5|$|Despite strong southerly shear {{exposing the}} LLCC, Bonnie {{intensified}} slightly {{to reach its}} initial peak intensity with winds of 45mph (75km/h) as it turned towards the north. However, the continued effects of high wind shear and dry air caused the cyclone's appearance to significantly degrade early on May29, as deep convection dissipated due to more than 46mph (74km/h) of southerly shear. Bonnie weakened back to tropical depression strength <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour prior to its landfall just east of Charleston, South Carolina. Caught in weak steering currents, the depression meandered over South Carolina for over a day before degenerating to a remnant low over the northeastern portion of the state at 12:00UTC on May30.|$|E
5|$|Kehoe {{drove up}} to the school <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour after the explosion. He saw Superintendent Huyck and summoned him over to his truck. Charles Hawson testified at the inquest that he saw the two men {{struggle}} over some type of long gun before Kehoe detonated the dynamite stored in his truck, killing himself, Superintendent Huyck, Nelson McFarren (a retired farmer), and Cleo Clayton, an eight-year-old second grader. Clayton had survived the first blast and had wandered out of the school building debris; he was killed by the fragmentation from the exploding vehicle. The explosion also mortally wounded postmaster Glenn O. Smith, who lost a leg and died later that day of his wounds, and injured several others.|$|E

5|$|The first {{landmarks}} of this mature style are {{the group}} of piano works published in 1907–1912 (the Elegies, the suite An die Jugend and the first two piano sonatinas) and Busoni's first completed opera, Die Brautwahl; together with the rather different Bach homage, the 1910 Fantasia contrappuntistica, Busoni's largest work for solo piano. <b>About</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour in length, it is essentially an extended fantasy on the final incomplete fugue from Bach's The Art of Fugue. It uses several melodic figures found in Bach's work, most notably the BACH motif. Busoni revised the work {{a number of times}} and arranged it for two pianos.|$|E
5|$|The {{performance}} was given on 29 September to an invited audience including Sir Henry Wood {{and most of}} the professional musicians in London. Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced The Planets to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst sent him a long letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave only five of the seven movements on that occasion.|$|E
5|$|The second sit-in {{occurred}} on Thursday, February 18, {{when more than}} 200 students entered Woolworths, S. H. Kress, McClellan, and Grants. The lunch counters were immediately closed. The students remained for <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour and then left, again without incident. The third sit-in {{occurred on}} February 20 when about 350 students entered the previous four stores and the downtown Walgreens drugstore. As the students sat at the counters, crowds of white youths gathered {{in several of the}} stores. Police kept a watchful eye on all five locations, but no incidents of violence occurred. The students remained for nearly three hours until adjourning to a mass meeting at the First Baptist Church.|$|E

5|$|Two days later, Small Heath, with Jack Lee and Bernard Pumfrey in {{the forward}} line instead of Walton and Mobley, and Littleford {{standing}} in at back, played a similarly depleted Wolverhampton Wanderers in the semi-final of the Mayor of Birmingham's Charity Cup. Hands scored Small Heath's opening goal, but sustained a leg injury after <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour; although he continued for a time, he was struggling, and could not complete the game. Despite the numerical disadvantage, Lee scored twice for Small Heath to take the tie 3–1.|$|E
5|$|Heavy Syrian {{shelling}} of Degania Alef {{started at}} about 04:00 on May 20 from the Samakh police station, {{by means of}} 75mm cannons, and 60 and 81mm mortars. The barrage lasted <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour. At 04:30 on May 20, the Syrian army began its advance on the Deganias and the bridge over the Jordan River north of Degania Alef. Unlike the attack on Samakh (Tzemah), this action saw the participation of {{nearly all of the}} Syrian forces stationed at Tel al-Qasr, including infantry, armor and artillery. The Israeli defenders numbered about 70 persons (67 according to Aharon Israeli's head count), most of them not regular fighters, with some Haganah and Palmach members. Their orders were to fight to the death. They had support from three 20mm guns at Beit Yerah, deployed along the road from Samakh to Degania Alef. They also had a Davidka mortar, which exploded during the battle, and a PIAT with fifteen projectiles.|$|E
5|$|Metrorail begins {{service at}} 5 am Monday through Friday, 7 am on Saturdays, and 8 am Sundays; it ends service at 11:30 pm Monday through Thursday, 1:00 am Friday and Saturday, and 11:00 pm on Sundays, {{although}} the last trains leave the end stations inbound <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour before these times. Trains run more frequently during rush hours on all lines, with scheduled peak hour headways of 4 {{minutes on the}} Red Line and 9 minutes on all other lines. Headways are much longer during midday and evening on weekdays and all weekend. The midday six-minute headways {{are based on a}} combination of two Metrorail lines (Orange/Blue and Yellow/Green) as each route can run every 12 minutes; {{in the case of the}} Red Line, every other train bound for Glenmont terminates at Silver Spring instead. Night and weekend service varies between 8 and 24 minutes, with trains generally scheduled only every 20 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Nosek's other friend Ondřej Vlach {{testified that}} Nosek's fall {{happened}} in a break {{between the end of}} concert and the encore. Nosek climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage. According to him, Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off. While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage, Nosek fell directly on the ground. According to Vlach, there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break. Vlach further testified that after the fall, Nosek went to sit on a bench, where he was fetched a water bottle. Nosek began vomiting <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a bulge {{at the back of his}} head, they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion. Vlach said that he understood Blythe's gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage.|$|E
5|$|Residents of Cove Neck {{immediately}} called emergency services. Jeff Race, a paramedic {{and member of}} New York City's Emergency Medical Service who lived {{half a mile from}} the crash site was the first rescuer on site. He reported that most passengers were still strapped in their seats and the survivors were crying out for help. Survivors later commented that it took <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour for rescue teams to arrive. Initial reports to emergency services reported that a much larger Boeing 747 had crashed. Fire Chief Thomas Reardon of Oyster Bay Fire Company No. 1 {{was in charge of the}} initial effort to remove people from the wreckage. In his first call to the Nassau County Fire Commission dispatch, he requested all the help available. Thirty-seven fire and ambulance companies, as well as more than seven hundred Nassau County police officers arrived to help. Other companies that were not called showed up voluntarily to assist. The swell of support created major problems for extricating survivors.|$|E
5|$|Some {{molecules}} or {{particles are}} too large or too hydrophilic {{to pass through}} a lipid bilayer. Other molecules could pass through the bilayer but must be transported rapidly in such large numbers that channel-type transport is impractical. In both cases, these types of cargo can be moved across the cell membrane through fusion or budding of vesicles. When a vesicle is produced inside the cell and fuses with the plasma membrane to release its contents into the extracellular space, this process is known as exocytosis. In the reverse process, a region of the cell membrane will dimple inwards and eventually pinch off, enclosing {{a portion of the}} extracellular fluid to transport it into the cell. Endocytosis and exocytosis rely on very different molecular machinery to function, but the two processes are intimately linked and could not work without each other. The primary mechanism of this interdependence is the sheer volume of lipid material involved. In a typical cell, an area of bilayer equivalent to the entire plasma membrane will travel through the endocytosis/exocytosis cycle in <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour. If these two processes were not balancing each other, the cell would either balloon outward to an unmanageable size or completely deplete its plasma membrane within a matter of minutes.|$|E

5|$|When {{the release}} of Homogenic was delayed by a month, its tour began with the {{audience}} not being familiar with the album's songs since {{it had not been}} released yet. The tour started at the beginning of September with a backing band that consisted only of Mark Bell and made stops in Germany, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Spain, and England. These shows were brief live shows lasting <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour consisting of only new material. Another tour took place in late October and lasted less than four weeks. Stops on this tour included Italy, Switzerland, France, England, Scotland, Germany, Ireland, and Denmark. In late November, Björk was diagnosed with a kidney infection and while she was still healthy she was advised to take a three-week rest and was forced to cancel her American tour. In 1998, a North American tour with Radiohead was announced but canceled later due to difficulty of changing the stage between performances of the acts. Björk had another tour in the middle of 1998 through Europe, and outside of the continent through other countries, including Chile, Brazil and Argentina. Opening acts for portions of the tour included electronic musician µ-Ziq.|$|E
