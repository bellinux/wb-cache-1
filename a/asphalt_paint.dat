40|$|Abstract. The {{anticorrosive}} {{work for}} pipeline {{is a long-term}} basic work. It is significant for us to lengthen pipeline working life and enhance the operation reliability. In this article, the corrosive status in quo and reasons for pipeline in Panjin oilfield were narrated. In accordance with the corrosive characters, the new anticorrosive coating that epoxy heavy anticorrosive over-rust primer/IPN topcoat was opened up. In the lab, the anticorrosive coating by analyzed with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The corrosion behavior of the new anticorrosive coating was {{compared with that of}} the traditional <b>asphalt</b> <b>paint.</b> The conclusion is that the epoxy heavy anticorrosive over-rust primer/IPN topcoat is superior to <b>asphalt</b> <b>paint</b> in anticorrosive properties...|$|E
30|$|Another {{preventive}} measure {{to be considered}} is {{the application of a}} cleaning and disinfection plan of the facilities, with authorized chemical products. Within this plan, it is recommended the abolition of all compost generating activities during a minimum period of 30  days and the realization of a sanitary break. Furthermore, the maintenance and conservation of the tunnels with a treatment of walls and roof with <b>asphalt</b> <b>paint</b> or other similar authorized material should be done at least once a year.|$|E

The Cant spoken in the US {{is similar to the}} Cant spoken in Ireland, but differs in some respects in that the {{language}} has transformed into a type of pidgin English over the generations. They typically work in <b>asphalting,</b> spray <b>painting,</b> laying linoleum, or as itinerant workers to earn their living.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{practical}} method for the tabulation and completion of measured BRDF data. The BRDF of materials {{is needed for}} lighting computations and computer graphics. It can be measured with a gonioreflectometer, but the resulting data is often irregular and always partial. A common solution to get a complete BRDF is to fit the available data with an analytical model. An arguably more accurate solution is to interpolate and extrapolate from the available data. This solution was implemented using Scilab, a free open-source software, and tested on two typical road surface materials: plain asphalt pavement and <b>asphalt</b> pavement <b>painted</b> with retroreflective marking...|$|R
25|$|There {{are also}} other methods and {{materials}} to create pavements that have appearance of brick pavements. The first method to create brick texture is to heat an asphalt pavement and use metal wires to imprint a brick pattern using a compactor to create stamped asphalt. A similar {{method is to}} use rubber imprinting tools to press over {{a thin layer of}} cement to create decorative concrete. Another method is to use a brick pattern stencil and apply a surfacing material over the stencil. Materials that can be applied to give the color of the brick and skid resistance can be in many forms. An example is to use colored polymer-modified concrete slurry which can be applied by screeding or spraying. Another material is aggregate-reinforced thermoplastic which can be heat applied to the top layer of the brick-pattern surface. Other coating materials over stamped <b>asphalt</b> are <b>paints</b> and two-part epoxy coating.|$|R
40|$|In {{the spring}} of 2007, we taught an {{interdisciplinary}} studio at Iowa State University in which twentyfour upper level students in architecture, landscape architecture, and community and regional planning were asked to address a three hundred acre site {{just south of the}} Des Moines, Iowa central business district near the confl uence of the Raccoon and Iowa Rivers. Past uses of the site have included rail yards, newspaper and magazine printing, tanning, <b>asphalt</b> manufacturing, <b>paint</b> manufacturing, coal and coke yards, foundry operations, iron works, and industrial chemical manufacturing. In 1975, industrial solvent contamination was discovered in the Des Moines water supply by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR); the site is adjacent to the main pumping station for the city, the Des Moines Water Works. Portions of the site were placed on the EPA’s National Priority List (NPL) in 1983 when pesticide-contaminated soils were discovered during the construction of the groundwater treatment system. Remediation has included an air stripper system for treatment of contaminated groundwater and an asphalt cap for containment of contaminated soils...|$|R
50|$|Arntzenius was an {{accomplished}} artist in several mediums, but especially his watercolours gained high praise. During his first years in The Hague, he painted landscapes {{in the typical}} Hague School style. Arntzenius later switched to mainly painting cityscapes and street scenes, just like Israëls and Breitner made in Amsterdam. Arntzenius' cityscapes were painted mainly in misty or rainy weather, he made use of these weather conditions to have his subjects be reflected on the wet <b>asphalt.</b> He also <b>painted</b> a lot in Scheveningen, which had changed from the poor fishing village {{it was in the}} time of Jozef Israëls and Hendrik Willem Mesdag, into a popular seaside resort.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "Makartstil", which {{determined}} {{the culture of}} an entire era in Vienna, was an aestheticism {{the likes of which}} hadn't been seen before him and has not been replicated to this day. Called the [...] "magician of colors", he painted in brilliant colors and fluid forms, which placed the design and the aesthetic of the work before all else. Often to heighten the strength of his colors he introduced <b>asphalt</b> into his <b>paint,</b> which has led to some deterioration in his paintings over the years. The paintings were usually large-scale and theatrical productions of historical motifs. Works such as The Papal Election reveal Makart's skill in the bold use of color to convey drama as well as his later developed virtuoso draughtsmanship.|$|R
40|$|Tyt. z nagłówka. Bibliogr. s. 221 - 222. Titanium, as a {{transition}} metal, demonstrates a high mechanical strength. It is light and corrosion resistant. The {{estimation of the}} environmental impact of the use of machine parts that grains are freed from and contact the surface of titanium alloys by wear is buffing. Due to its catalytic action, TiO 2 is nowadays added to <b>asphalt,</b> concrete, exterior <b>paints</b> for elevation, self-cleaning glass and protective coatings. It is also present in clothes, food (E 171), cosmetics (CI 77891) and textiles. The research on the toxicity of titanium and its compounds points towards their neutral character, however an adverse impact is also observed in nature. TiO 2 may affect air quality. It promotes free radicals and ozone origination. The properties and direction of the use of titanium compounds and their influence on the circulation of pollutants are described below.

40|$|With {{the purpose}} of {{estimating}} the source contributions of nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC) to the atmosphere at three different sites in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area, 92 ambient air samples were measured from February 23 to March 22 of 1997. Light- and heavy-duty vehicular profiles were determined to differentiate the NMHC contribution of diesel and gasoline to the atmosphere. Food cooking source profiles were also determined for chemical mass balance receptor model application. Initial source contribution estimates were carried out to determine the adequate combination of source profiles and fitting species. Ambient samples of NMHC were apportioned to motor vehicle exhaust, gasoline vapor, handling and distribution of liquefied petroleum gas (LP gas), <b>asphalt</b> operations, <b>painting</b> operations, landfills, and food cooking. Both gasoline and diesel motor vehicle exhaust were the major NMHC contributors for all sites and times, with a percentage of up to 75 %. The average motor vehicle exhaust contributions increased during the day. In contrast, LP gas contribution was higher during the morning than in the afternoon. Apportionment for the most abundant individual NMHC showed that the vehicular source is the major contributor to acetylene, ethylene, pentanes, n-hexane, toluene, and xylenes, while handling and distribution of LP gas was the major source contributor to propane and butanes. Comparison between CMB estimates of NMHC and the emission inventory showed a good agreement for vehicles, handling and distribution of LP gas, and painting operations; nevertheless, emissions from diesel exhaust and asphalt operations showed differences, and {{the results suggest that}} these emissions could be underestimated...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring {{the process}} of urbanization, {{different}} surface properties significantly alter the radiation balance. This paper attempts to quantify this balance over different surface types in an arid city of northwest Mexico over several days in August 2011. The albedo of each surface type, {{as well as local}} atmospheric properties such as the atmospheric clearness index (K 0) and atmospheric emissivity (εatm), were estimated. The surfaces on which measurements were performed were <b>asphalt,</b> concrete, polystyrene <b>painted</b> with white elastomeric paint (PWEP), clay, and grass. It was found that, for a 24 -h cycle of measurement, the highest average value of net radiation was for asphalt (146. 1 Wm– 2), and the lowest average value was for PWEP (33. 6 Wm– 2). Estimates of albedo values vary depending on the surface, whereas K 0 and εatm are dependent on prevailing atmospheric conditions. From these measurements, preliminary statistical models of net radiation as a function of incoming solar radiation and net shortwave radiation were proposed. For each model, the coefficients of determination were higher than 0. 97. We discuss the likely implications of the results found for the urban planning of the city...|$|R
5000|$|Ductile {{iron pipe}} is a pipe made of {{ductile cast iron}} {{commonly}} used for potable water transmission and distribution. This type of pipe is a direct development of earlier cast iron pipe, which it has superseded. The ductile iron used to manufacture the pipe {{is characterized by the}} spheroidal or nodular nature of the graphite within the iron. Typically, the pipe is manufactured using centrifugal casting in metal or resin lined moulds. Protective internal linings and external coatings are often applied to ductile iron pipes to inhibit corrosion: the standard internal lining is cement mortar and standard external coatings include bonded zinc, <b>asphalt</b> or water-based <b>paint.</b> In highly corrosive environments loose polyethylene sleeving (LPS) to encase the pipe may also be used. Life expectancy of unprotected ductile iron pipes depends on the corrosiveness of soil present and tends to be shorter where soil is highly corrosive. However, a lifespan in excess of 100 years has been estimated for ductile iron pipelines installed using [...] "evolved laying practices", including use of properly installed LPS (polyethylene encasement). [...] Studies of ductile iron pipe's environmental impact have differing findings regarding emissions and energy consumed. Ductile iron pipe manufactured in the United States has been certified as a sustainable product by the Institute for Market Transformation to Sustainability.|$|R
