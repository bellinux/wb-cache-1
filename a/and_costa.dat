5|$|A 2010 {{study by}} Delton Hanson and colleagues used DNA {{sequence}} {{data from the}} mitochondrial gene cytochrome b (Cytb) and two nuclear markers, exon 1 of the interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein gene (Rbp3) and intron 2 of alcohol dehydrogenase gene 1 (Adh1-I2) to study relationships among populations of the marsh rice rat and O.couesi. The Cytb data placed all studied specimens of O.couesi in a clade sister to the marsh rice rat; the mean genetic distance {{between the two groups}} was 11.30%, much larger than the distance between sister species in the related genera Melanomys and Nectomys (7.48% and 7.52%, respectively). Within the O.couesi clade, two populations from Panama <b>and</b> <b>Costa</b> Rica were successively basal to the other specimens, which fell into two large subclades—one containing animals from the Pacific seaboard from western Mexico to El Salvador and the other containing rats from the eastern seaboard from Texas to Nicaragua. The Panamanian <b>and</b> <b>Costa</b> Rican populations differed by 6.53% to 11.93% from the others and the western and eastern subclades differed by 4.41% on average. Data from both of the slower-evolving nuclear markers Rbp3 and Adh1-I2 also placed examples of Oryzomys in two main clades, but did not recover the western and eastern groups of O.couesi as separate clades. In addition, Adh1-I2 placed the Costa Rican population within the marsh rice rat clade and placed some western O.couesi specimens closer to the marsh rice rat than to the O.couesi group. The combined dataset supported the western and eastern clades within O.couesi and placed the Costa Rican population marginally closer to the marsh rice rat than to O.couesi. Using the genetic species concept, the authors suggested that the four groups they found within O.couesi should be recognized as distinct species. If this suggestion is followed, the eastern subclade would retain the name Oryzomys couesi, the western group would be named Oryzomys mexicanus, and the appropriate names for the Panamanian <b>and</b> <b>Costa</b> Rican species remain unclear.|$|E
5|$|Although Panama <b>and</b> <b>Costa</b> Rica {{were not}} in the direct path of Hurricane Beta, storm {{warnings}} were issued for the two countries on October27 as heavy rains, up to 20in (508mm), from the outer bands of Beta were possible. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Panama alerted officials in Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala about the possible impacts from Beta. Civil defence officials in El Salvador declared a pre-emptive alert due to the possibility of rain-triggered mudslides from the outer bands of Beta.|$|E

5|$|Central America gained its {{independence}} along with New Spain. On September 15, 1821, an Act of Independence {{was signed in}} Guatemala City which declared Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, <b>and</b> <b>Costa</b> Rica) independent from Spain. The regional elites supported {{the terms of the}} Plan of Iguala and orchestrated the union of Central America with the Mexican Empire in 1821. Two years later, following Iturbide's downfall, the region, with the exception of Chiapas, peacefully seceded from Mexico on July 1, 1823, establishing the Federal Republic of Central America. The new state existed for seventeen years, centrifugal forces pulling the individual provinces apart by 1840.|$|E
5|$|During the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) Congress in Guatemala City, Guatemala on January 26, 1991, the {{qualification}} rounds for {{the inaugural}} CONCACAF Gold Cup was decided upon. Since Costa Rica {{were given a}} bye into the competition due to its first place standing at the 1989 CONCACAF Championship, which {{also served as a}} qualification phase for the FIFA World Cup hosted by Italy in 1990, they weren't required to participate in the preliminary stages. However, the final qualification round of the Central American zone had two bids: the United States <b>and</b> <b>Costa</b> Rica. Costa Rica won the bid and was named by CONCACAF and UNCAF as the host nation of the inaugural UNCAF Nations Cup tournament on February 19, 1991.|$|E
5|$|Exsudoporus frostii (formerly Boletus frostii), {{commonly}} known as Frost's bolete or the apple bolete, is a bolete fungus first described scientifically in 1874. A {{member of the family}} Boletaceae, the mushrooms produced by the fungus have tubes and pores instead of gills on the underside of their caps. Exsudoporus frostii is distributed in the eastern United States from Maine to Georgia, and in the southwest from Arizona extending south to Mexico <b>and</b> <b>Costa</b> Rica. A mycorrhizal species, its fruit bodies are typically found growing near hardwood trees, especially oak.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, American {{botanist}} Paul C. Standley described {{three new}} species based on collections from Panama <b>and</b> <b>Costa</b> Rica—Ficus tuerckheimii, F. isophlebia and F. jimenezii. DeWolf {{concluded that they}} were all the same species, and Berg synonymised them with F. aurea. These names have been used widely for Mexican and Central American populations, and continue to be used by some authors. Berg suspected that Ficus rzedowskiana Carvajal and Cuevas-Figueroa may also belong to this species, but he had not examined the original material upon which this species was based.|$|E
5|$|Later that month, Costa and Mario Suárez were loaned to Segunda División side Celta de Vigo for the season, <b>and</b> <b>Costa</b> {{became a}} regular in the team, managed by former Ballon d'Or winner Hristo Stoichkov. In his seventh league match, he scored his first goal in Spanish {{football}} in a dominant home victory over Xerez; after scoring, he showboated, causing a brawl {{which resulted in}} him being sent off. Costa was subsequently rested from Celta's away game at the same opposition. The event drew the wrath of Stoichkov, who unexpectedly left his position. Towards {{the middle of the}} season, he was involved in two further controversies: he struck Málaga defender Weligton in the head, causing an injury which required medical stitches, and was sent off against Sevilla Atlético for diving and dissent, leaving his team to fight for a draw without him. The loyal strike partner of Quincy Owusu-Abeyie despite the pair not sharing a common language, he was dropped for Cypriot Ioannis Okkas. On 23 March 2008, Costa scored both Celta goals in a 2–1 win at Numancia, the latter after a long dribble; but later on in the campaign, he was sent off against Tenerife at Balaídos, after which Celta went from winning 2–0 to drawing 2–2. The team barely avoided relegation, <b>and</b> <b>Costa</b> earned a reputation for being a disruptive influence.|$|E

5|$|The 2006 FIFA World Cup {{qualification}} process and 2005 UNCAF Nations Cup (hosted in Guatemala) were both huge disasters for El Salvador. In the former {{they received a}} by to the second round where they inched past Bermuda 4–3 on aggregate (2–1, 2–2). In the third round they were drawn into a home–and–away round–robin group with Jamaica, Panama, and the United States. El Salvador finished last in the group with just 4 points from 6 games. In the 2005 UNCAF Nations Cup they failed to advance past the first round after losing against Panama 0–1 <b>and</b> <b>Costa</b> Rica 1–2. This mean they also failed {{to qualify for the}} 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup. They were coached by Carlos Cavagnaro.|$|E
5|$|The {{active role}} of Treviño Morales got him the loyalty and respect {{of many in}} Los Zetas, and {{eventually}} many stopped paying to Lazcano Lazcano. In order to avoid his arrest or death from betrayal, Lazcano Lazcano reportedly fled the country and lived in Germany <b>and</b> <b>Costa</b> Rica for an unknown time with surrounding rumors that he had terminal cancer. Back in Mexico, Treviño Morales had become the stronger of the two in Los Zetas. Lazcano Lazcano was then killed by the Mexican Navy {{in the state of}} Coahuila on 7 October 2012, and Treviño Morales succeeded him as the top leader of Los Zetas.|$|E
5|$|The tournament was {{expanded}} to 24 teams in 1982, {{and then to}} 32 in 1998, also allowing more teams from Africa, Asia and North America to take part. Since then, teams from these regions have enjoyed more success, with several having reached the quarter-finals: Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1986; Cameroon, quarter-finalists in 1990; South Korea, finishing in fourth place in 2002; Senegal, along with USA, both quarter-finalists in 2002; Ghana, quarter-finalists in 2010; <b>and</b> <b>Costa</b> Rica, quarter-finalists in 2014. Nevertheless, European and South American teams continue to dominate, e.g., the quarter-finalists in 1994, 1998, and 2006 were all from Europe or South America and so were the finalists of all tournaments so far.|$|E
