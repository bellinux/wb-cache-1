50|$|This {{concept is}} termed EC cycling, and was {{developed}} {{as a solution to}} the gradients that form within hollow fiber bioreactors when media is pushed down the length of their fibers. Higher hydrostatic pressure at the <b>axial</b> <b>end</b> (media entering the fiber lumen) compared to the distal end of the bioreactor creates a Starling flow in the EC space, which is similar to what is observed in the body. This phenomenon also creates a nutrient-rich axial region and a nutrient-depleted distal region within the bioreactor. By incorporating EC cycling, the effects of Starling flow are eliminated and the entire bioreactor becomes nutrient-rich and optimized for cell growth.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of applied axial loads on the fundamental vibration frequency is strictly {{connected with the}} stability analysis of elastic slender beams. For this reason, the correct evaluation of the fundamental frequency is of primary importance in designing new structures and components, {{as well as in}} monitoring existing ones. At the same time, if an internal axial load arises in a slender element as the consequence of an imposed (static) <b>axial</b> <b>end</b> displacement, then a different dynamic structural response is encountered respect to the case in which a beam end is free to slide, during transverse vibration, and a (constant) axial load is applied externally. This difference is due to the change in the axial boundary condition. Moreover, the presence of an initial curvature of the beam axis may significantly affect the aforesaid response. The experimental study proposed in the present paper investigates the dependence of the fundamental frequency on the axial load in slender beams subjected to imposed <b>axial</b> <b>end</b> displacements. The considered specimens presented different geometrical imperfections (initial curvatures), and were tested in two different constraint conditions (hinged-hinged and hinged-clamped).

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} finite-element {{model is}} used to compare isothermal and radio-frequency-assisted chemical vapor infiltration of long cylindrical carbon preforms. Densification with radio-frequency heating at a constant input power initially occurs radially around the central zone and then axially toward {{the ends of the}} preform.

40|$|A {{popular and}} useful {{piezoelectric}} actuator is the stack. Unfortunately {{with this type}} of actuation architecture the long lengths normally required to obtain necessary displacements can pose packaging and buckling problems. To overcome these limitations, a new architecture for piezoelectric actuators has been developed called telescopic. The basic design consists of concentric shells interconnected by end-caps which alternate in placement between the two <b>axial</b> <b>ends</b> of the shells. This leads to a linear displacement amplification at the cost of force; yet the force remains at the same magnitude as a stack and significantly higher than bender type architectures.

50|$|The {{elliptic}} chamber {{is called}} a 'cam ring' by the industry. As a vane moves into, say, a maximum extension, and then rotates into a minimum extension region of the cam ring, it passes through a gradual transition from maximum to minimum followed by a gradual transitionback to maximum and this happens twice per revolution. In order to prevent oil under pressure from bypassing the vanes, 4 sealing areasare created by means of 4 kidney shaped ports located in the transition areas between minimum and maximum. The spaces between the kidney ports are called the sealing areas and this port system is located at either, or both <b>axial</b> <b>ends</b> of the rotor and vanes. The configuration of the ports and sealing areas are such that the space between any two adjacent vanes is slightly less than the coverage ofthe sealing area. In other words, as the vanes rotate through the sealing area, for {{a small amount of}} rotation, both adjacent vanes arewithin the sealing area. As the rotation continues, the first vane in line leaves the sealing area, but not before the next vane in succession is firmly in the sealing region.|$|R

This smart TMD consists of a force actuator-sensor unit suspended in a rigid frame by two flexible beams coupled to the <b>axial</b> <b>ends</b> of the unit and the frame. The force actuator-sensor unit is composed of a giant magnetostrictive composite-based force actuator for producing an axial force to the beams {{and a pair of}} piezoelectric ceramic-based force sensors for generating a tuning signal. Through adjusting the magnetic field strength applied to the force actuator to change the axial force exerted on the beams, the transversal bending stiffness of the beams and hence the natural frequency of the smart TMD is tuned. In this paper, the design, fabrication, and characterized of the smart TMD is described. The measured resonance frequency of the smart TMD is 65 Hz at zero magnetic tuning field and 50 Hz at an applied magnetic field of 686 Oe.
