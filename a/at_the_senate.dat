5|$|The 1960s were {{a time of}} {{considerable}} student activism in the United Kingdom, and Bristol was no exception. In 1968, many students marched {{in support of the}} Anderson Report, which called for higher student grants. This discontent culminated in an 11-day sit-in <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> House (the administrative headquarters of the university). A series of chancellors and vice-chancellors led the university through these decades, with Henry Somerset, 10th Duke of Beaufort taking over from Churchill as chancellor in 1965 before being succeeded by Dorothy Hodgkin in 1970 who spent the next 18 years in the office.|$|E
5|$|Caldwell {{is perhaps}} best {{known as one of}} the {{principal}} architects of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the first act of its kind in the world, signed into law on January 1, 1970. In drafting A National Policy on the Environment in 1968 as consultant to Senator Henry Jackson, the head of the powerful Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, Caldwell realized that more was needed than a mere a policy statement: an “action-forcing mechanism” would be necessary to secure federal agency compliance with the Act’s requirements. The origin of the requirement for preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) has been attributed to Caldwell, whose testimony <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> hearing in April 1969 laid the groundwork for inclusion of provisions requiring an evaluation of the effects of all major federal projects significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. In these “detailed statements,” as they were termed in the Act, all reasonably foreseeable social, economic, and environmental effects of a proposed action and any possible alternatives to it must be identified and assessed before any federal action takes place.|$|E

25|$|Tens of {{thousands}} of people marched in Vicenza against the expansion of Caserma Ederle, which saw the participation of some leading far-left members of the government. Harsh debates followed in the Italian Senate on 20 February 2007. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Massimo D'Alema declared during an official visit in Ibiza, Spain that, without a majority on foreign policy affairs, the government would resign. The following day, D'Alema gave a speech <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> representing the government, clarifying his foreign policy and asking the Senate to vote for or against it. In spite of the fear of many senators that Prodi's defeat would return Silvio Berlusconi to power, the Senate did not approve a motion backing Prodi's government foreign policy, two votes shy of the required majority of 160.|$|E

25|$|In the Subcommittee on Appropriations in the Senate, however, Senator Millard Tydings (D-Maryland) said {{he would}} seek to add the bridged {{appropriation}} (although he would not hold up the bill if the effort failed). Senator Elmer Thomas (D-Oklahoma) demanded that if Tydings' effort was successful that other projects be cut {{so as not to}} raise the overall cost of the bill. Members of the Northeast Washington Citizens Association and the Congress Heights Citizens Association both testified in favor of the Tydings amendment. The subcommittee restored the appropriation on March 2 at a reported $620,000, cancelling the Dupont and Thomas Circle underpasses and the K Street viaduct. The full Appropriations Committee approved the bill on March 3. A conference committee agreed on March 14 to adopt a conference bill that included the bridge appropriation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> level, and the final bill passed Congress on May 18.|$|E
25|$|Appian {{wrote that}} Vettius, a plebeian, {{run to the}} forum with a drawn dagger to kill Caesar and Pompey. He was arrested and {{questioned}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> house. He {{said that he had}} been sent by Calpurnius Bibulus, Cicero, and Cato, and that the dagger was given to him by one of the bodyguards of Calpurnius Bibulus. The event was open to all suspicions. Caesar took advantage of this to arouse the crowd and postponed further interrogation to the next day. However, Vettius was killed in prison during the night. Caesar claimed that he was killed by the optimates {{who did not want to}} be exposed. The crowd gave Caesar a bodyguard. According to Appian, it is at this point that Bibulus withdrew from public business and did not go out of his house for the rest of his term of office. Caesar, who run public affairs on his own, did not make any further investigations into this affair. In the version of Cassius Dio Vettius was sent by Cicero and Lucullus. He did not say when this happened and did not give any details about the actual event. He wrote that Vettius accused these two men and Calpurnius Bibulus. However, Bibulus had revealed the plan to Pompey. This undermined his credibility. There were suspicions that he was lying about Cicero and Lucullus as well and that this was a ploy by Caesar and Pompey to discredit the optimates. There were various theories, but nothing was proven. After naming the mentioned men in public, Vettius was sent to prison and was murdered a little later. Caesar and Pompey suspected Cicero and their suspicions were confined by his defence of Gaius Antonius Hybrida in a trial.|$|E

[...] When Caroline Kennedy announced her interest in the vacancy, comparisons were drawn to Clinton in 2000, with both being famous people seeking to hold elective office for the first time. [...] Others pointed out that Clinton had won election to the office while Kennedy would first be appointed. [...] In any case, Kennedy's effort soon faltered, in part due to not having the same desire or willingness to work for the seat as Clinton had had, and she soon withdrew as abruptly as she had entered.|$|E
