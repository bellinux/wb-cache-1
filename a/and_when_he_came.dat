25|$|John Edward Rogers (8 February 1858 – 8 July 1935) was an Australian cricketer {{who played}} two {{first-class}} matches for Victoria {{during the early}} 1890s. Rogers was born in Sydney, New South Wales, though little else is known of his early life, including how <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to reside in the neighbouring colony of Victoria. A right-arm fast bowler, he made his first-class debut against Tasmania in March 1891, {{at the end of}} the 1890–91 season. He took a single wicket in a low-scoring affair, with John Carlton (5/26 and 7/53) and Norman Rock (5/21) dominating for Victoria and Tasmania, respectively. Rogers' second and final match for Victoria came at the beginning of the following season, against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. He took 2/96 in South Australia's only innings, in a match notable for George Giffen's all-round dominance—Giffen scored 271 runs out of a total of 562 all out, and then took 16 wickets (9/96 and 7/70) to allow South Australia to win by an innings and 164 runs. Rogers played no further matches at a high level, and died in Melbourne in July 1935, aged 77.|$|E
25|$|In 1413, the Ottoman prince Mehmed I {{ended the}} civil war of the Ottoman Interregnum and {{established}} himself as Sultan and the sole master of the Ottoman realm. In 1414, he campaigned in Anatolia against Junayd of Aydın, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to Smyrna several {{of the most important}} Latin rulers of the Aegean Sea—the Genoese lords of Chios, Phokaia, and Lesbos, and even the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller—came to do him obeisance. One contemporary account by Byzantine historian Doukas (after 1462) reports that the Sultan was enraged that the Duke of Naxos was absent, and as a retaliation he equipped a fleet of 30 vessels, under the command of Çali Bey, and in late 1415 sent it to raid the Cyclades, the domain of the Duke of Naxos. The Ottoman fleet ravaged the islands, and carried off {{a large part of the}} inhabitants of Andros, Paros, and Melos. On the other hand, the Venetian historian Marino Sanuto the Younger (1466–1536) indicates that the Ottoman attack was in retaliation for the raids against Ottoman shipping undertaken by Pietro Zeno, the lord of Andros. Although Zeno was a Venetian citizen and vassal of the Republic of Venice, he had not been included in the previous treaties between the Republic and the Ottomans, and had continued raiding Ottoman shipping on his own account.|$|E

She had her daughter Jessie (Jessica) in 1987. Mouton credited her father Pierre's support as the secret for her success: [...] "He loved driving. He loved fast cars.

500|$|In {{the first}} scene the two girls are {{returning}} from school, Agnes accompanied by her punning attribute, a lamb with a cruciform halo, and carrying a martyr's palm. They are accosted by Procopius, the young son of the Prefect of Rome, who has {{fallen in love with}} Agnes and shows her an open casket of jewels to persuade her to marry him. The inside of the casket is white, the only colour of opaque enamel in the original work, used only for a few highlights like the tiny area of the host held by Christ {{on the inside of the}} cover. Agnes [...] rejects him, with the words Illi sum desponsata cui angeli serviunt ("I am betrothed to him who the angels serve") in a banderole above. In the Caxton her rejection is unequivocal and not polite, and she points out that her heavenly fiancé has promised her much better jewels. [...] The Prefect stands behind his son, and in the next scene has sentenced her to serve in a brothel for being a Christian who refuses to sacrifice to the goddess Vesta. Caxton's Legend fills in the intervening action: Then made she of the bordel her oratory, ... All they that entered made honour and reverence to the great clearness that they saw about St. Agnes, and came out more devout and more clean than they entered. At last came the son of the provost with a great company for to accomplish his foul desires and lusts. And when he saw his fellows come out and issue all abashed, he mocked them and called them cowards. And then he, all araged, entered for to accomplish his evil will. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to the clearness, he advanced him for to take the virgin, and anon the devil took him by the throat and strangled him that he fell down dead. In the next scene on the cup, Agnes stands outside the sentry box-like brothel, looking down at the Prefect's son who has been strangled to death by the devil crouched over him; a banderole reads Quo modo cecidisti qui mane oriebaris ("How has thou fallen that risest in the morning", [...] ), and the Prefect looks on sadly.|$|E
