40|$|Background: The World Health Organisation {{reports that}} road traffic {{accidents}} (accidents) {{could become the}} seventh {{leading cause of death}} globally by 2030. Accidents often occur in spatial clusters and, generally, there are more accidents in less advantaged areas. Infrastructure changes, such as new roads, can affect the locations and magnitude of accident clusters but evidence of impact is lacking. A new 5 -mile motorway extension was opened in 2011 in Glasgow, Scotland. Previous research found no impact on the number of accidents but did not consider their spatial location or socio-economic setting. We evaluated impacts on these, both locally and city-wide. Methods: We used STATS 19 data covering the period 2008 to 2014 and describing the location and details of all reported accidents involving a personal injury. Poisson-based continuous scan statistics were used to detect spatial clusters of accidents and any change in these over time. Change in the socio-economic distribution of <b>accident</b> <b>cluster</b> locations during the study period was also assessed. Results: In each year accidents were strongly clustered, with statistically significant clusters more likely to occur in socio-economically deprived areas. There was no significant shift in the magnitude or location of accident clusters during motorway construction or following opening, either locally or city-wide. There was also no impact on the socio-economic patterning of <b>accident</b> <b>cluster</b> locations. Conclusions: Although urban infrastructure changes occur constantly, all around the world, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of such changes on road accident clusters. Despite expectations to the contrary from both proponents and opponents of the M 74 extension, we found no beneficial or adverse change in the socio-spatial distribution of accidents associated with its construction, opening or operation. Our approach and findings can help inform urban planning internationally...|$|E
40|$|In {{terms of}} continual {{increase}} of number of traffic accidents and alarming trend of {{increasing number of}} traffic accidents with catastrophic consequences for human life and health, {{it is necessary to}} actively research and develop methods to combat these trends. One of the measures is the implementation of advanced information systems in existing traffic environment. <b>Accidents</b> <b>clusters,</b> as databases of traffic accidents, introduce a new dimension in traffic systems in the form of experience, providing information on current accidents and the ones that have previously occurred in a given period. This paper proposes a new approach to predictive management of traffic processes, based on the collection of data in real time and is based on <b>accidents</b> <b>clusters.</b> The modern traffic information services collects road traffic status data {{from a wide variety of}} traffic sensing systems using modern ICT technologies, creating the most accurate road traffic situation awareness achieved so far. Road traffic situation awareness enhanced by accident clusters' data can be visualized and distributed in various ways (including the forms of dynamic heat maps) and on various information platforms, suiting the requirements of the end-users. Accent is placed on their significant features that are based on additional knowledge about existing traffic processes and distribution of important traffic information in order to prevent and reduce traffic accidents...|$|R

The K function was used to identify <b>accident</b> <b>clusters,</b> the kernel intensity function was used to detect accident hotspots, and the independent t-test {{was used to assess}} if percent slope was the underlying environmental factor that affects the occurrence of accidents. The results indicated that <b>accidents</b> were significantly <b>clustered.</b> The hotspots were where riders crested hills in the directional zone and encountered an abrupt slope on the back side. Another high-risk area was in directionally unrestricted areas. The t-test confirmed that accidents occurred in the steeper slope areas more frequently than flat areas.

The definitive version is available at: [URL] increasing proportion of new vehicles are being fitted with autonomous emergency braking systems. It is difficult for consumers to judge {{the effectiveness of these}} safety systems for individual models unless their performance is evaluated through track testing under controlled conditions. This paper aimed to {{contribute to the development of}} relevant test conditions by describing typical circumstances of pedestrian <b>accidents.</b> <b>Cluster</b> analysis was applied to two large British databases and both highlighted an urban scenario in daylight and fine weather where a small pedestrian walks across the road, especially from the near kerb, in clear view of a driver who is travelling straight ahead. For each dataset a main test configuration was defined to represent the conditions of the most common accident scenario along with test variations to reflect the characteristics of less common accident scenarios. Some of the variations pertaining to less common accident circumstances or to a minority of casualties in these scenarios were proposed as optional or supplementary test elements for an outstanding performance rating. Many considerations are incorporated into the final design and implementation of an actual testing regime, such as cost and the state of development of technology; only the representation of accident data lay within the scope of this paper.

Road traffic quality can be quantitatively evaluated in accordance with values of losses pertaining to social and economic cost of discretionary (unenforced) expenses for road traffic process. Road traffic contains accident, ecological, economic and social risks. Accidence is considered {{as the most important}} risk for participants involved in road traffic because it directly concerns their life, health and welfare.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{analysis}} of fatal avalanche accidents {{in the state}} of Colorado (CO) and the United States (US) for 20 winters from 1990 - 91 to 2010 - 11, compared temporal trends and clustering in the temporal pattern of accidents. The number of accidents per season in the US has increased through time, and decreased slightly in CO. Variability is high from season to season. Temporal clustering in the US data was much stronger than in CO, and was possibly related to synoptic scale weather patterns. Temporal clusters in CO were possibly related to strong mesoscale storms in seasons with a weak, early season snowpack. Geographic coordinates for accidents in CO allowed an examination of the spatial distribution and <b>clustering</b> of <b>accidents.</b> Spatial <b>clusters</b> were likely related to access to avalanche terrain from ski areas or popular backcountry trailheads.

40|$|At the {{national}} level, Parks Canada employs GIS to support {{reporting on the}} ecological integrity of the nation’s national parks, using road development as an indicator. GIS is a critical technology for addressing the spatial and temporal relationship between land use and conservation. Historical and contemporary digital road data were mapped in and surrounding Canada’s 39 National Parks and National Park Reserves. Internal park road density, park area and the ratio of alien to native species were employed as indices to the ecological integrity of the parks. Road density surrounding Canada’s national parks was correlated with other infrastructure, land use and human population {{to demonstrate that the}} former was a valid quantitative, spatially and temporally explicit index to the latter. External road density and land use, as well as landscape fragmentation and the measures of loss of park ecological integrity, increased spatially from north to south. External road density increased temporally from the 1950 ’s to the 1990 ’s but internal park road density increased in only a minority of parks. Historical and contemporary road data provide a readily available quantitative measure of the constraints to restoring and maintaining the ecological integrity of {{the national}} parks with predictive utility for tracking future trends in land use and fragmentation of the native ecosystem. At the field unit level, GIS technology is used as a tool to examine the ecological impacts of roads. The locations of wildlife-vehicle collisions on major highways in the Rocky Mountain Parks were examined to assess factors influencing the frequency of wildlife-vehicle collisions and identify various mitigation measures. On the high traffic volume, high speed, divided section of Highway 1 in Banff National Park various types of overpasses and underpasses are used in combination with fencing to link wildlife habitats and reduce road kill. On lower traffic volume highways it is difficult to justify the cost of this intensive mitigation. Other measures need to be examined. A highway safety study of existing and proposed wildlife warning sign locations along Highway 93 South in Kootenay National Park found that most of the existing highway wildlife warning signs were not located at high animal kill sites (which corresponded to where watershed valleys intersected the highway). The new locations for the highway animal warning signs correspond to <b>accident</b> <b>clusters</b> involving wildlife. Another lower traffic volume highway is Highway 16 in Jasper N. P. The GIS database was used to examine driver (photo log) images of kill sites. The analysis of wildlife kill sites along this route indicated that the physical characteristics of the highway and corridor were good predictors of kill sites. Common factors of high kill sites included good roadside habitat, water supply nearby and long wide straight stretches of road. GIS will be used at the project level for the next phase of twinning Highway 1 in Banff. GIS can produce project displays and base maps to either help conceptualize the project, explain it to the public, or provide base mapping or other data for study and/or planning purposes.

Results show that accidents occurring in “black” zones are characterized by left-turns at signalized intersections, collisions with pedestrians, loss control of the vehicle (run-off-roadway) and rainy weather conditions. Accidents occurring outside “black” zones (scattered in space) are characterized by left turns on intersections with traffic signs, head-on collisions and drunken road user(s). Furthermore, parallel collisions and accidents on highways or roads with separated lanes, occurring at night or during the weekend are frequently occurring accident patterns for all accident locations. These exploratory results show the potentiality of the frequent item set method in addition to more classical statistical techniques, but also suggest that there is no unique countermeasure for reducing the number of accidents...|$|R

Previous research has used the Five-factor Model (FFM) of personality to classify drivers into three common configurations: resilient drivers, overcontrolled drivers and under-controlled drivers. Self-report data from drivers were analysed using cluster analysis {{in order to determine}} whether a similar set of patterns emerged when driving-specific measures were used and whether these patterns were linked to driving behaviour and accidents. The 402 participants (323 females; 79 males) were mainly first to third year psychology students. The Driver Stress Inventory (DSI; Matthews, Desmond, Joyner, Carcary, & Gilliland, 1997) measured the following characteristics: Aggression, Hazard Monitoring, Thrill Seeking, Dislike of Driving, and Fatigue Proneness. The Driver Coping Questionnaire (DCQ; Matthews, et al., 1997) measured confrontive coping, task-focused coping, emotion-focused coping, reappraisal, and avoidance. All scales were found to be reliable with coefficient alphas of at least. 70. Data were also obtained on the drivers’ level of self-reported speeding (measured using six items with an alpha of. 84), their number of near misses in the previous six months (one item), and their number of accidents {{in the last six months}} (one item). A two-step clustering procedure produced a result with three clusters in the solution. Cluster 1 (N = 152) was defined lower task-focused and lower reappraisal) and greater aggression and thrill-seeking. Cluster 2 (N = 150) was defined by more adaptive coping (lower confrontive, higher task-focused and higher reappraisal), lower aggression and greater hazard monitoring. The third cluster (N = 98) was defined by more moderate scores on the coping scales (apart from a much greater level of emotion-focused coping), higher dislike of driving, and higher fatigue proneness. Validation against the three outcome measures showed that cluster 2 reported significantly less self-reported speeding than cluster 3 which was significantly less than cluster 1. Cluster 2 also reported significantly smaller number of near misses than clusters 2 and 3. Cluster 2 reported significantly fewer <b>accidents</b> than <b>cluster</b> 3. The cluster analysis confirmed that three subtypes of drivers can be identified from driver-specific measures of personality and coping. These subtypes differ in their driving behaviour with one cluster being linked with better driving outcomes (cluster 2) while clusters 3 and 1 were most at risk of adverse outcomes. These clusters may also respond differently to road safety messages particularly as cluster 3 expressed a strong dislike of driving and greater emotional exhaustion from driving...|$|R

S. mines. Using the GEP sub-model, a small subset of the 36 recorded attributes was found to be correlated to the severity level. ResultsGiven the set of specified attributes, the clustering sub-model was able to <b>cluster</b> the <b>accident</b> records into 5 distinct groups. For instance, the first <b>cluster</b> contained <b>accidents</b> related to minerals processing mills and coal preparation plants (91 %). More than two-thirds of the victims in this cluster had less than 5 years of job experience. This cluster was associated with the highest percentage of severe injuries (22 severe accidents, 3. 4 %). Almost 50 % of all <b>accidents</b> in this <b>cluster</b> occurred at stone operations. Similarly, the other four clusters were characterized to highlight important patterns {{that can be used to}} determine areas of focus for safety initiatives. ConclusionsThe identified <b>clusters</b> of <b>accidents</b> may play a vital role in the prevention of severe injuries in mining. Further research into the cluster attributes and identified patterns will be necessary to determine how these factors can be mitigated to reduce the risk of severe injuries. Practical applicationAnalyzing injury data using data mining techniques provides some insight into attributes that are associated with high accuracies for predicting injury severity.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the association between}} accident proneness and (un) conscious self-destructiveness {{in a sample of}} injury repeaters attend-ing a Dutch emergency department. Accident proneness is the concept used to explain the observation that <b>accidents</b> tend to <b>cluster</b> within indi-viduals. It refers to the tendency of an individual to experience more ac-cidents than otherwise identical individuals (in terms of basic personal characteristics like age, gender and place of residence), due to stable per-sonality characteristics. Accident-prone individuals suffer from their inju-ries and they use a disproportionate part of medical services due to their injuries. This makes these individuals an important target in injury pre-vention. Accident proneness The concept of accident proneness has been and still is the subject of much debate. Therefore, this thesis starts with the investigation of the mere existence of the concept. Chapter 2 presents a review of definitions and operationalisations used in various studies concerning accident proneness. Definitions, operationalisations, and subject characteristics varied highly among these studies. Therefore, this chapter provides no overall estimate of the prevalence of accident proneness. However, by meta-analysis of empirical data of eight studies of the general population, the number of observed accident repeaters is higher than the number ex-pected by chance. Thus, an accident-prone group indeed exists. Next, the question emerges how these accident-prone individuals can be identified, since the majority of accident repeaters experience accidents due to mere bad luck. Injury circumstances This second methodological issue is investigated in Chapter 3. The group of accident repeaters is probably a heterogeneous one. Not all accident repeaters can be marked as accident-prone, because some of them may experience accidents solely due to bad luck or behaviours of others. This suggests that examining accident or injury circumstances may help to identify repeaters with accidents that occur mainly because of their own behaviours. Therefore, we compare a sample of injury repeaters and sin-gly injured patients attending an emergency department on injury cir-cumstances. Injury circumstances include injury environments such as home and traffic and include the influence of patients’ own behaviours on injury causation. In injury repeaters, patients own high-risk behaviours such as aggressiveness, alcohol, and medication use, are more often in-volved in injury occurrence than in singly injured patients. This differ-ence is especially present in environments in which these behaviours most frequently occur, namely in nightlife and at home. Mood and anxiety disorders These findings indicate that high-risk behaviours {{may play a role in}} acci-dent proneness. This raises the question whether accidents are the result of unconscious self-destructive tendencies, as illustrated by the everyday expression ‘accidentally on purpose’. Since self-destructive tendencies or intentional injuries are associated with mental illnesses, we compare a sample of the general population with injury repeaters on the prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders in Chapter 4. In high-risk behaviour injury repeaters, the prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders is higher than in a sample of the general population. This association is independent of the presence of alcohol dependence. Self-destructiveness Thus, accident proneness shares correlates with intentional injury occur-rence. Accident proneness as an expression of self-destructiveness implies that accident proneness is associated with conscious self-destructive ten-dencies such as deliberate self-harm and suicide attempts. Less evident self-destructive tendencies such as an unhealthy lifestyle may also be as-sociated with accident proneness. The position of accident proneness on a continuum of self-destructiveness is investigated in Chapter 5. We com-pare the prevalence of suicidal ideation and unhealthy lifestyles in injury repeaters and self-harmers with a sample of the general population. The results of this study reveal that injury repeaters can be placed between individuals of the population and individuals with intentional injuries on a continuum of self-destructive tendencies. Accident proneness may thus be regarded as an expression of self-destructiveness. Implications of this study In this study, we find accident proneness to be associated with high-risk behaviours, mood and anxiety disorders, and (un) conscious self-destructive tendencies. However, in the future, longitudinal research is needed to investigate the causality between these potential risk factors and accident proneness. Based on the results of those studies, prospective intervention studies can be developed targeting underlying risk factors which may prevent other health problems as well. ...|$|R
