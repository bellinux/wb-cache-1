5|$|On July 2, 1862, William and Jim Anderson {{returned}} to Council Grove and sent an accomplice to Baker's house {{claiming to be}} <b>a</b> <b>traveler</b> seeking supplies. Baker and his brother-in-law brought the man to a store, where they were ambushed by the Anderson brothers. After a brief gunfight, Baker and his brother-in-law fled into the store's basement.

They also burnt Baker's home and stole two of his horses before returning to Missouri on the Santa Fe Trail.|$|E
5|$|Pedro's {{character}} {{was marked by}} an energetic drive that bordered on hyperactivity. He was impetuous with {{a tendency to be}} domineering and short-tempered. Easily bored or distracted, in his personal life he entertained himself with dalliances with women in addition to his hunting and equestrian activities. His restless spirit compelled him to search for adventure, and, sometimes in disguise as <b>a</b> <b>traveler,</b> he frequented taverns in Rio de Janeiro's disreputable districts. He rarely drank alcohol, but was an incorrigible womanizer. His earliest known lasting affair was with a French dancer called Noémi Thierry, who had a stillborn child by him. Pedro's father, who had ascended the throne as JoãoVI, sent Thierry away to avoid jeopardizing the prince's betrothal to Archduchess Maria Leopoldina, daughter of Emperor FranzI of Austria (formerly FranzII, Holy Roman Emperor).|$|E
5|$|The Fountain is a 2006 American epic magical realism romantic drama {{film that}} blends {{elements}} of fantasy, history, spirituality, and science fiction. It {{is directed by}} Darren Aronofsky, and stars Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. The film consists of three storylines involving immortality and the resulting loves lost, and one man's pursuit of avoiding this fate in this life or beyond it. Jackman and Weisz play sets of characters bonded by love across time and space: a conquistador and his ill-fated queen, a modern-day scientist and his cancer-stricken wife, and <b>a</b> <b>traveler</b> immersed in a universal journey alongside aspects of his lost love. The storylines—interwoven with use of match cuts and recurring visual motifs—reflect the themes and interplay of love and mortality.|$|E

25|$|Tilt-and-roll luggage or wheeled luggage, is {{a variant}} of luggage for {{travelers}} which typically contains two-fixed wheels on one end and a telescoping handle on the opposite end for vertical movement.

In 1988, Northwest Airlines pilot Robert Plath invented tilt-and-roll luggage as travelers beforehand had to carry suitcases in their hands, toss garment bags over their shoulders, or strap luggage on top of metal carts.|$|E

25|$|The radar-time {{definition}} of extended-simultaneity further facilitates visualization {{of the way}} that acceleration curves spacetime for travelers {{in the absence of any}} gravitating objects. This is illustrated in the figure at right, which shows radar time/position isocontours for events in flat spacetime as experienced by <b>a</b> <b>traveler</b> (red trajectory) taking a constant proper-acceleration roundtrip. One caveat of this approach is that the time and place of remote events are not fully defined until light from such an event is able to reach our traveler.|$|E
25|$|A pilgrim (from the Latin peregrinus) is <b>a</b> <b>traveler</b> (literally one who {{has come}} from afar) who is on a journey to a holy place.

In the spiritual literature of Christianity, the concept of pilgrim and pilgrimage may refer {{to the experience of}} life in the world (considered as a period of exile) or to the inner path of the spiritual aspirant from a state of wretchedness to a state of beatitude.|$|E
25|$|After the Civil War {{ended in}} 1865, California {{continued}} to grow rapidly. Independent miners were largely displaced by large corporate mining operations. Railroads began to be built, and both the railroad companies and the mining companies began to hire large numbers of laborers. The decisive event was {{the opening of the}} transcontinental railroad in 1869; six days by train brought <b>a</b> <b>traveler</b> from Chicago to San Francisco, compared to six months by ship. The era of comparative protection for California labor ended {{with the arrival of the}} railroad. For decades after, labor opposed Chinese immigrant workers and politicians pushed anti-Chinese legislation.|$|E
