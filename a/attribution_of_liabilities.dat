40|$|Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) is {{an adverse}} {{reaction}} {{that may occur}} in patients administered with bisphosphonates (BP). This condition can cause high morbidity and hinder quality of life. Its treatment is complex and often unsatisfactory, and prevention strategies may have limited effectiveness, if any. Thus, managing patients treated with BP may result in exposure of the practitioner to legal liability or malpractice claims: legal actions pursuant to BRONJ are reported to be underway on three continents. Nonetheless, the <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability,</b> if any, is a complex process requiring, {{on the basis of}} current knowledge, a robust and pragmatic approach to the facts, which must be identified {{from the point of view}} of the time, place and individuals involved. This means a comprehensive consideration of the sequence of actions from bisphosphonates prescription to BRONJ occurrence (as well as immediately after, and any action potentially related to its causation or worsening) is required in order to determine if a breach in informing, diagnosing, managing or referring the patient took place, as well as determining if the patient was compliant in attending to prescriptions and follow-up programme...|$|R
40|$|This article aims {{to explore}} the central {{challenges}} that preclude the <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> to multinational corporations (MNCs) through a contextual analysis of the recent Akpan ruling of the District Court of The Hague. It considers the lack of direct regulation for multinationals {{at the international level}} and explores the procedural/substantive hurdles which pervade in the domestic systems of “host” and “home” States, in an exposition of the overall deficit in protection. The article employs a case-based approach, utilising the judgement of a recent Dutch case concerning environmental damage in Nigeria as a vehicle to discuss parent/subsidiary liability. The article demonstrates the procedural impediments that arise in the domestic forums of developing countries, as well as the jurisdictional challenges presented by corporate structures which preclude home State protection. Absent effective international regulation, this paper demonstrates that continued emphasis on State responsibility, particularly in developing countries, is unworkable. The article provides a fresh illustration of the challenges to the regulation of MNCs in the light of recent case law. It contributes to an evolving literature on the wider topic of non-State actor regulation, which continues to generate significant academic debate...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{significant}} legal challenges impede the <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> to parent corporations for the overseas operations of their subsidiaries. The multinational reach of these entities’ activities raise questions as to which forum is appropriate to hear the case, under which state’s jurisdiction an action may be brought and as to which state’s domestic law should be applied. The elaborate corporate structures exhibited by many multinational corporations (MNCs), which often incorporate holding companies, joint ventures and external contractors, serve to complicate matters still further. The recent case of Akpan & Anor v Royal Dutch Shell plc & Anor dealt with these issues in an environmental context. The case formed part of a class action suit brought by Milieudefensie (Friends of the Earth Netherlands), a Dutch non-governmental organisation (NGO) promoting environmental protection, and four Nigerian farmers. The farmers had all experienced damage to their farmlands and fishing ponds resulting from numerous oil spills across three proximate regions between 2004 and 2007. Akpan, the only successful applicant, is a farmer and fisherman residing {{in the village of}} Ikot Ada Udo, Nigeria. Throughout the course of the action, all four Nigerian applicants were supported by Milieudefensie, which itself attempted to bring claims against both the parent company and its wholly owned subsidiary as a third party...|$|R
40|$|This article dissects the Tadic court’s {{argument}} for finding {{the doctrine of}} joint criminal enterprise in the ICTY Statute. The key arguments are identified and each {{are found to be}} either problematic or insufficient to deduce the doctrine from the statute: the object and purpose of the statute to punish major war criminals, the inherently collective nature of war crimes and genocide and the conviction of war criminals for joint enterprises in World War II cases. The author criticizes this overreliance on international case law and the insufficient attention to the language of criminal statutes when interpreting conspiracy doctrines. The result of these mistakes is a doctrine of joint criminal enterprise that fails to offer a sufficiently nuanced treatment of intentionality, foreseeability and culpability. Specifically, the doctrine in its current form suffers from three conceptual deficiencies: (1) the mistaken <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> criminal <b>liability</b> for contributors who do not intend to further the criminal purpose of the enterprise, (2) the imposition <b>of</b> criminal <b>liability</b> for the foreseeable acts of one’s co-conspirators and (3) the mistaken claim that all members of a joint enterprise are equally culpable for the actions of its members. The author concludes by briefly suggesting amendments to the Rome Statute to rectify these deficiencies...|$|R

In {{light of}} the growing {{importance}} fundamental rights have acquired in competition enforcement and of the ramifications of the Lisbon Treaty (EU accession to the ECHR, binding Charter), this thesis assesses two paramount concerns: whether {{the current level of}} fundamental rights protection in cartel enforcement falls within the accepted ECHR standards and how the often conflicting objectives of effectiveness and adequate protection of fundamental rights could optimally be achieved. Normative answers to both questions are given following a thorough analysis of EU institutional, substantive and procedural law rules. Accordingly, the thesis first provides a theoretical analysis of the legal framework of fundamental rights protection identifying the pertinent rights and legal nature of competition proceedings under EU and ECHR law. It then tackles the long-standing debate of the compatibility of the EU enforcement system with the ECHR’s due process institutional requirements. Thereafter, a cartel-specific analysis is conducted juxtaposing the increased investigatory powers vested in competition authorities with the privilege against self-incrimination and right to privacy. The interaction between the substantive rules of legal qualification of cartels and the “fair trial” probatory requirements is then examined, as to illustrate the degree of use of presumptions in EU practice. These will then be weighed against the Article 6 ECHR guarantees pertaining to the presumption of innocence {{in the form of an}} adequate set of standard/burden of proof and evidence admissibility rules. The thesis proceeds with a review of the rules <b>of</b> <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> and fining, attempting to reconcile “effective deterrence” with the principles of legality, non-retroactivity, presumption of innocence and ne bis in idem. Having appraised the entire spectrum of enforcement components with a fundamental rights dimension, general conclusions are drawn on the status of compatibility with the ECHR and on the necessity of introducing further reforms enhancing the overall effectiveness and legitimacy of the system...|$|R

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author © 1999 Dr. Matthew CollinsThe Internet is a unique and revolutionary medium of communication. The objective of this dissertation is to identify whether there are areas in which reform {{of the rules of}} Australian civil defamation law needs to be undertaken to meet the challenges posed by this new medium and, if so, to advocate desirable reforms. The methodology by which the dissertation sets out to achieve its objective is a systematic analysis of how the defamation cause of action, defences and remedies, as well as relevant jurisdiction and choice of law rules, apply, or are likely to apply, to material published via the Internet. It is possible to distil five features of communication via the Internet which are of relevance to the operation of the rules of civil defamation law: - Internet communications do not respect geographical boundaries: they involve the transfer of signals from computers in indeterminate locations, to other computers in indeterminate locations, via routes which are indeterminate; - intermediaries, in the form of Internet service providers and network operators, {{play a central role in}} all Internet communications; - material published via the Internet can be republished to a wide and geographically diverse audience more easily than material published via other means; - material on the Internet is organised through the use of hyperlinks which blur the distinction between where one publication ends and the next begins; - the Internet can be used in a wide variety of ways, to resemble almost any other medium, including the telephone, the postal service, radio, television, newspapers or libraries. Once the way in which the Internet works and is used is understood, it is possible to predict how most of the rules of defamation law would apply to material published via the Internet. The outcome of the research undertaken in this dissertation is that most of those rules are capable of being applied without the need for reform. In other areas, however, the existing rules give rise to uncertainty, or undesirable outcomes, when applied to Internet publications. In those areas, reform is desirable. Ultimately, four areas of reform of the existing rules of defamation law are identified, and desirable reforms suggested: 1 Reform to clarify whether different types of Internet publication are libel or slander. 2 Reform to ensure that intermediaries of Internet publications are only liable for civil defamation where their conduct is sufficiently culpable to warrant the <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability.</b> 3 Expansion <b>of</b> the remedies available in civil defamation law to provide successful plaintiffs with more effective means of vindicating their reputations where they have been damaged by defamatory Internet publications. 4 Reform of the choice of law rules applicable to intra-Australian publications, by adoption of a rule that substantive rights and liabilities are determined by applying solely the law of the place (or places) of publication, regardless of the place in which proceedings are brought and determined.

40|$|Both the ICTY and the ICC have {{struggled}} to combine vertical and horizontal modes <b>of</b> <b>liability.</b> At the ICTY, the question has primarily arisen {{within the context of}} ‘leadership-level’ JCEs and how to express their relationship with the Relevant Physical Perpetrators of the crimes. The ICC addressed the is-sue by combining indirect perpetration with co-perpetration to form a new mode <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> known as indirect co-perpetration. The following article argues that these novel combinations — vertical and horizontal modes <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> — cannot be simply asserted; they must be defended at the level of criminal law theory. Unfortunately, courts that have applied indirect co-perpetration have generally failed to offer this defense and have simply assumed that modes <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> can be combined at will. In an attempt to offer the needed justification, this article starts with the premise that modes <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> are ‘linking principles’ that link defendants with particular actions, and that combining these underlying linking principles requires a second-order linking principle. The most plausible candidate is the personality principle — a basic principle that recognizes the inherently collective nature of leadership-level groups dedicated to committing international crimes. Like Roxin’s theories describing the collective organizations that {{can be used as a}} form of indirect perpetration, the personality principle treats the horizontal leadership group as an organization or group agent whose collective nature potentially justifies the <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> vertical modes <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> to all members of the horizontal group. Although this article does not defend the doctrine of indirect co-perpetration, it does conclude that combined vertical and horizontal modes <b>of</b> <b>liability,</b> whether at the ICTY or ICC, implicitly or covertly rely on something like the personality principle in order to justify collective attribution to the horizontal collective...|$|R
40|$|Emeseh, Engobo, 'Corporate Responsibility for Crime: Thinking {{outside the}} Box' I University of Botswana Law Journal (2005) 28 - 49 RAE 2008 Since the 19 th century when {{corporations}} were first made {{the subject of}} criminal law, {{there has been a}} ongoing controversy regarding the theoretical basis of this. The crux of this debate is whether criminal liability can exist without moral blameworthiness, or put another way, whether corporations not being human or natural person can be held responsible for a crime which ostensibly connotes fault or moral wrongdoing. In spite of this however, there is increasing use of criminal sanctions to regulate corporate behavior. Public opinion is also increasing in favor of criminalizing corporate wrongs. This has been more so {{in the latter part of}} the 20 th century, when the power and influence wielded by corporations and the harm they can cause has been highlighted in several high profile incidents involving corporations. It is therefore unlikely that corporate criminal liability will go away in the near future if at all. Against this background, this paper, after reviewing the current debate and developments in corporate criminal liability theory, argues that although there are apparent theoretical problems in the current methods <b>of</b> <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> criminal <b>liability</b> to corporations, this is more to do it limiting such thinking within the confines of existing criminal law theory, Criminal law theories applicable to natural persons obviously have constraints when applied to a non natural person. Nevertheless, law, just as the society it servers, is dynamic and therefore criminal law theories have to adapt to the realities of the modern world. Corporate criminal liability is here to stay for the foreseeable future and therefore what is needed is perhaps a pragmatic approach which seeks to make its application more effective. In this regard, there are already attempts to develop alternative models for attributing liability to corporations. These are far from perfect theories at this stage. Nevertheless, they are pragmatic in their approach and a worthwhile focus of academic attention. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} intends to {{investigate}} the issue of asset protection {{in the conduct of}} business activities, especially the internal credit structuring of a subject through the establishment of an endo-subjective segregation of assets, disconnected from the <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> legal personality, creating a further limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> the entrepreneur that goes beyond the usual shareholders limited liability. The reason for the growth of the asset segregation technique, both in civil law and common law systems, is linked to the economical need of isolating pools of assets committed to specific purposes and protecting them from claims of creditors other than the functional creditors of the purpose, reducing the establishment and management costs related {{to the creation of a}} new corporate structure and, in a perspective of corporate finance - according to the results of the law and economics studies - the financing cost. As pointed out by Hansmann and Kraakman the assets partitioning, in the two different profiles of Affirmative and Defensive asset partitioning, represents an essential feature of organizational forms provided for the exercise of a business activity. But the phenomenon of asset partitioning is placed in a complex theoretical system, representing a transversal issue that affects not only the area of company law, but also fundamental concepts of private law as the debtor’s personal liability and the concept of legal person. For this reason, the starting point of the this analysis (Chapter One) is the study of the theoretical foundations of common and civil law systems related to essential concepts such as the notion and the different theories about patrimony, the debtor’s personal liability, and the concept of legal person and legal entity (in connection with the so-called autonomia patrimoniale perfetta), highlighting similarities or differences and exploring their development until today. After the analysis of these essential concepts, the study focuses (Chapter Two) on the use of asset partitioning in company law and, in particular, on the birth and the evolution of organizational forms arranged for the conduction of business activities in both systems. From the earliest forms of companies characterized by some form of assets partitioning and legal personality, to the last business forms, characterized by systems of endo-subjective asset segregation. The analysis about each organizational form, with particular attention to forms of companies characterized by the endo-subjective segregation, was conducted in a functional perspective, analyzing the presence or not of the legal personhood, the presence or not of the Affirmative and Defensive asset partitioning profiles, and the level of creditors protection that, in case of a further limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> the entrepreneur, assumes a crucial importance. The data collected, particularly in relation to three essential legal systems - France and Italy for the civil law area and the United States for the common law area - show that in the last decade, despite the path-dependence of each legal system, the use of the endo-subjective segregation technique has grown in several countries of the Western Legal Tradition area. Once observed differences and similarities between the new corporate structures, it was possible to show how the introduction of these new models of asset segregation produce identical problems in different jurisdictions, as the application of bankruptcy and tax law, generally related to the lack of legal personality. The introduction of similar new company forms discloses the convergence of civil and common law systems, even if based on different theoretical foundations. This convergence is essentially due to several factors such as the globalization of markets and economies, which strengthens the attempt to the unification of commercial and company law towards a new lex mercatoria and encourages states to put in place legislation able to attract foreign investment in a competition and forum shopping perspective, increasing the spontaneous circulation of models. From a theoretical point of view it has been possible to reach several conclusions. On one side, we note that in the context of the asset partitioning theory, the endo-subjective segregation (of series, PCCs and founds committed to a specific purpose) could lead to a peculiar configurations of Affirmative and Defensive asset partitioning: the production of a "Double Defensive asset partitioning" effect (a double shield for assets segregated into the internal cells of a company for both, specialized creditors of the cells or general creditors of the company), or a “Triple Defensive asset partitioning" only for Delaware series with different members; and a stronger Affirmative asset partitioning (considering beyond the general impossibility of personal shareholders’ creditors to reach company's assets, the further segregation of assets within each cell, that are committed only to the claims of specialized cell’s creditors), that could become “Double” for Delaware series with different members (series members’ personal creditors have no claims toward both, series assets and company assets). On the other side, in terms of regulation, it can be noticed at first that it seems essential that the further limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> a subject, obtained through an endo-subjective segregation of assets, is supported by appropriate forms of disclosure in order to protect creditors, who must be aware of the structure of the company in terms <b>of</b> <b>liability,</b> and by a more penetrating system to protect involuntary creditors, in respect of which seems proper the expansion <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> to all company’s assets. Moreover, for a greater diffusion of these new company structures a regulatory or courts intervention is necessary in both systems, to clarify and complete the current legislation, harmonizing it within the existing system, especially with the bankruptcy legislation, ensuring the efficiency and the compliance with their ratio, their essential nature of asset segregation and <b>attribution</b> <b>of</b> limited <b>liability</b> disjointed from the presence of legal personality, in order to preserve, also in case of dysfunction, the advantages of expanding financing channels and lowering the cost of debt capital as highlighted in the law and economics studies...|$|R

Limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses are common in business contracts, especially in construction, a field that includes many professionals such as engineers and architects. While Florida has historically enforced limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses in professional services contracts, recent cases have cast doubt on whether the clauses are enforceable.

This Note argues that Florida should not prohibit professionals from using limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} how {{the absence of}} insurance in the past led to some special maritime liability law principles such as 'general average' (i. e., losses or expenses shared by all the parties to a maritime adventure) and the limitation <b>of</b> shipowners' <b>liability.</b> In the absence of insurance, these principles served the function of insurance mostly for shipowners. As commercial marine insurance is now widely available, these principles have lost their justification and may in fact interfere with the most important goal <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law i. e., deterrence from negligence. The thesis thus recommends their abolition. The thesis further argues that when insurance is easily available and affordable to the both parties to a liability claim, the main goal <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law should be deterrence as opposed to compensation. This is exactly {{the case with the}} maritime cargo liability claims where both cargo owners and shipowners are invariably insured. As a result, the sole focus <b>of</b> cargo <b>liability</b> law should be and, to a great extent, is deterrence. On the other hand, in the vessel-source oil pollution liability setting, pollution victims are not usually insured. Therefore, oil pollution liability law has to cater both for compensation and deterrence, the two traditional goals <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law. The final question the thesis addresses is whether the deterrent effect <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law is affected by the availability <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> insurance.
