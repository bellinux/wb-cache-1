Consisting of a phenyl group attached to an amino group, aniline is the prototypical <b>aromatic</b> <b>amine.</b> Its main use {{is in the}} manufacture of precursors to polyurethane and other industrial chemicals.

25|$|As used by fumigators {{to detect}} {{hydrogen}} cyanide, copper(II) salt and an <b>aromatic</b> <b>amine</b> such as benzidine {{is added to}} the sample; as an alternative to benzidine an alternative amine di-(4,4-bis-dimethylaminophenyl) methane can be used. A positive test gives a blue color. Copper(I) cyanide is poorly soluble. By sequestering the copper(I) the copper(II) is rendered a stronger oxidant. The copper, in a cyanide facilitated oxidation, converts the amine into a colored compound. The Nernst equation explains this process. Another good example of such chemistry {{is the way in which}} the saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) works. The copper, in a cyanide-facilitated oxidation, converts the amine into a colored compound.|$|E

These compounds have been considered highly toxic to human beings due to their carcinogenic nature. Three groups of <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> have been recognized: monocyclic, polycyclic and heterocyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines.</b> Bacterial degradation of several monocyclic aromatic compounds has been studied {{in a variety of}} bacteria, which utilizes monocyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> as their sole source of carbon and energy. Several degradation pathways have been proposed and the related enzymes and genes have also been characterized. Many reviews have been reviewed toxicity of monocyclic aromatic amines; however, there is lack of review on biodegradation of monocyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines.</b> The aim of this review is to summarize bacterial degradation of monocyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines.</b> This review will increase our current understanding of biochemical and molecular basis of bacterial degradation of monocyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines...</b>|$|R

40|$|Surface {{waters are}} under {{constant}} pressure of numerous chemicals causing a prominent threat for aquatic and human health. Mutagenicity {{is one of}} the most frequently observed adverse effects in aquatic environments. Although findings show that <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> are major contributors, so far no individual mutagens were identified raising the question whether unknown individual chemicals or complex mixtures of <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> may be regarded as drivers of this effect. This thesis aimed to develop and apply a comprehensive approach to unravel the surface water mutagenicity with a focus on <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> which {{is one of the}} most important class of compounds due to their high production volumes, extensive use in daily life and many of them being known or suspected mutagens. In Chapter 2, a post-column and a pre-column derivatization method to label <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> with liquid chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) were evaluated to facilitate the detection of <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> in complex environmental matrices. Different derivatization reagents were utilized under various temperature and pH conditions and time constraints to optimize the method. Pre-column derivatization with 4 -Fluoro- 7 -nitro- 2, 1, 3 -benzoxadiazole (NBD-F) was found to be the optimum approach yielding sufficient derivative signal intensities and derivatives showed common fragments of diagnostic value. The high reactivity of NBD-F resulted in the derivatization of not only primary and secondary <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> but also thiols, aliphatic amines and nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds. The developed method was successfully applied as a peak prioritization step to six mutagenic wastewater samples collected with Blue Rayon from the area Bitterfeld-Wolfen and several derivatives were confirmed by diagnostic neutral losses. The selected peaks with confirmed derivatives were subjected to a compound identification process in Chapter 3. Two complementary analytical methods namely hydrogen-deuterium exchange and ph-dependent LC retention were applied in order to facilitate candidate selection and identification of <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines.</b> As a result of the applied workflow, 14 amines were identified including two potent mutagenic <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> 2, 3 - and 2, 8 -phenazinediamines that were found as major contributors to the detected mutagenicity of the wastewater samples. The dye industry in the area was found to be the possible source for the generation of diaminophenazines as a transformation product. In Chapter 4, a full EDA study was compiled to unravel the contribution of <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> to the long term observed mutagenicity in River Rhine. The developed derivatization method was applied to active fractions which were selected based on the results of the diagnostic strain YG 1024. In addition to the complementary LC methods, the candidate selection was supported by two prediction models namely nitrenium and TIMES model. Twenty one compounds from different classes were identified including two <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> and three carboline alkaloids, one being the known co-mutagen norharman. Although none of the identified compounds showed any response individually or in mixtures without <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines,</b> the mixtures of <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> with carbolines showed strong synergistic effects which were increased even more in the presence of other nonmutagenic nitrogen containing compounds. In the presented PhD thesis, a comprehensive approach was developed and applied combining biological, chemical and prediction tools in order to unveil the role of <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> on the observed surface water mutagenicity. It is demonstrated that <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> are key mutagens in surface waters either as individual mutagens or as drivers of mixture effects together with natural compounds. These findings point at the importance of monitoring <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> and offer new insights to unravel surface water mutagenicity by considering synergistic effects of not only mutagens alone but also possible comutagens and nonmutagenic compounds...|$|R

40|$|Because of its {{environmental}} and industrial importance, the <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> are the single chemical class most studied {{for its ability}} to induce mutations and cancer. The large database of mutagenicity and carcinogenicity results has been studied with Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) approaches by several authors, leading to models for the following: (a) the mutagenic potency in Salmonella thyphimurium; (b) the carcinogenic potency in rodents; and (c) the discrimination between rodent carcinogens and noncarcinogens. However, satisfactory models for the discrimination between mutagens and nonmutagens are lacking. The present work provides new QSARs for mutagenic/nonmutagenic homocyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> in S. typhimurium strains TA 98 and TA 100. The two new models are validated by checking their ability to predict the mutagenicity of further <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> not included in the training set, and not used to generate the QSAR models. In addition, we also validated previous QSAR models for the carcinogenicity/ noncarcinogenicity of the <b>aromatic</b> <b>amines</b> with external data.
