40|$|The {{attenuation}} of starlight by dust in galactic environments is investigated through {{models of}} radiative transfer in a spherical, clumpy ISM. Extinction properties for MW, LMC, and SMC dust types are considered. It is illustrated that the <b>attenuation</b> <b>curves</b> are primarily {{determined by the}} wavelength dependence of absorption {{rather than by the}} underlying extinction (absorption+scattering) <b>curve.</b> <b>Attenuation</b> <b>curves</b> consistent with the "Calzetti attenuation curve" are found by assuming the silicate-carbonaceous dust model for the MW, but with the 2175 A absorption bump suppressed or absent. The discrepancy between our results and previous work that claimed the SMC-type dust to be the most likely origin of the Calzetti curve is ascribed to the difference in adopted albedos; this study uses the theoretically calculated albedos whereas the previous ones adopted empirically derived albedos from observations of reflection nebulae. It is also found that the model <b>attenuation</b> <b>curves</b> calculated with the MW dust are well represented by a modified Calzetti curve with a varying slope and UV bump strength. The strong correlation between the slope and UV bump strength, with steeper curves having stronger bumps, as found in star-forming galaxies at 0. 5 <z< 2. 0, is well reproduced by our models if the abundance of the UV bump carriers or PAHs is assumed to be 30 % or 40 % of that of the MW-dust. The trend is explained by radiative transfer effects which lead to shallower <b>attenuation</b> <b>curves</b> with weaker UV bumps as the ISM is more clumpy and dustier. We also argue {{that at least some of}} the IUE local starburst galaxies may have a UV bump feature in their <b>attenuation</b> <b>curves,</b> albeit much weaker than that of the MW extinction curve.

We attribute the discrepancy in median magnitude between face-on (b/a> 0. 7) and edge-on (b/a<= 0. 4) subsamples solely to dust attenuation, and obtain the average attenuation in the rest-frame UV and optical as functions of stellar mass and redshift out to z= 2. 5.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{understand}} the characteristics of noise attenuation of a diesel engine block, by means of setting up a structural attenuation model and exploring the impact of variations of the model, in terms of nonlinearities. A model motivated {{by a set of}} experimentally-determined attenuation measurements was constructed, validated and explored for the potential for sound power prediction, with the aid of simulation. ^ <b>Attenuation</b> <b>curves</b> have long been considered an effective and straightforward method to understand the relationship between cylinder pressure and the corresponding noise radiation from an engine block. Preliminary measurements on a small single-cylinder diesel engine, however, suggest dependency of <b>attenuation</b> <b>curves</b> on injection parameters and operating conditions of the engine. Such dependency signals a possibility of inherent nonlinearities in the engine block attenuation and calls for a deeper investigation of the hypothesis. ^ A mass-spring-damper-based model was developed from the averaged experimental attenuation measurements and served as an alternative to <b>attenuation</b> <b>curves</b> to represent the noise attenuation characteristics of the engine block. The hypothesis of inherent nonlinearities was tested with the model and simulation results demonstrated relevance of nonlinearities to several off-linear behaviors of experimentally-determined <b>attenuation</b> <b>curves.</b> Validation for the model was performed by simulation under different operating conditions, and consistent observations further justified the nonlinear hypothesis. Nonlinearities were also categorized to account for different behaviors of the attenuation model. ^ Based on the model developed, sound power levels were predicted for a given set of cylinder pressures under different operating conditions. The simulation-model-based predictions demonstrated more reliability compared to the attenuation-curves-based prediction. Predictions among different models, linear or nonlinear, were compared and the impact of nonlinearities was analyzed. Judging the validity and accuracy of the predictions, however, requires further experimental measurements in the future. ...|$|R

Our sample consists of 224 star-forming galaxies with nebular spectroscopic redshifts in the range z= 1. 36 - 2. 59 and high S/N measurements of, or upper limits on, the H-alpha and H-beta emission lines obtained with Keck/MOSFIRE. We construct composite SEDs of galaxies in bins of specific SFR and Balmer optical depth in order to directly constrain the dust <b>attenuation</b> <b>curve</b> from the UV through near-IR for typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift. Our results imply an <b>attenuation</b> <b>curve</b> that {{is very similar to}} the SMC extinction curve at wavelengths redward of 2500 Angstroms. At shorter wavelengths, the shape of the curve is identical to that of the Calzetti relation, but with a lower normalization (R_V). Hence, the new <b>attenuation</b> <b>curve</b> results in SFRs that are ~ 20 % lower, and log stellar masses that are 0. 16 dex lower, than those obtained with the Calzetti <b>attenuation</b> <b>curve.</b> Moreover, we find that the difference in the reddening [...] -and the total attenuation [...] -of the ionized gas and stellar continuum correlates strongly with SFR, such that for dust-corrected SFRs larger than 20 Msun/yr assuming a Chabrier IMF, the nebular emission lines suffer an increasing degree of obscuration relative to the continuum. A simple model that can account for these trends is one in which the UV through optical stellar continuum is dominated by a population of less reddened stars, while the nebular line and bolometric luminosities become increasingly dominated by dustier stellar populations for galaxies with large SFRs, {{as a result of the}} increased dust enrichment that accompanies such galaxies. Consequently, UV- and SED-based SFRs may underestimate the total SFR at even modest levels of ~ 20 Msun/yr.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique for {{the determination of}} the material damping ratio of shallow soil layers. It is based on the spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW) test. The technique is an alternative to existing methods, where the damping ratio is determined from the spatial decay of the Rayleigh wave. These methods are based on the hypothesis that the response of the soil in the SASW test is due to a single mode surface wave. Therefore, the resulting <b>attenuation</b> <b>curve</b> can become erroneous when higher modes contribute to the soil's response. Moreover, in these methods, the estimate of the <b>attenuation</b> <b>curve</b> is based on an estimate of the geometric spreading function. The latter is computed using the shear wave velocity of the soil, which is determined by inversion of the experimental dispersion curve. Errors in the experimental dispersion curve and in the inversion procedure lead to an erroneous geometric spreading factor and, consequently, experimental <b>attenuation</b> <b>curve.</b> In the proposed technique, the $f$-$k$ method is used to determine the experimental dispersion and attenuation curves and, subsequently, the soil profile. The dispersion curve is derived from the peak's position, while the <b>attenuation</b> <b>curve</b> is derived from its width, using the half-power bandwidth method. In this method {{there is no need for}} calculating the geometric damping. The occurrence of higher Rayleigh modes does not affect the <b>attenuation</b> <b>curve</b> associated with the fundamental Rayleigh wave, as higher modes appear as separate peaks in the $f$-$k$ spectrum and do not interfere with the peak corresponding to the fundamental Rayleigh wave. Synthetic examples are used to validate the outlined technique; the results are compared with those obtained using two state-of-the-art methods. It is demonstrated that all three methods work well when applied to a regular soil profile, where the stiffness of the soil increases with depth. In case of soil profiles with soft layers trapped between stiffer layers, or profiles including a lot of thin layers that are approximated by a few thick layers, the proposed technique leads to accurate results. status: publishe...|$|E

In contrast to the normal, relatively flat, mean AGN <b>attenuation</b> <b>curve,</b> BAL dust is well fit by a steeply rising, SMC-like curve. We confirm {{the shape of the}} theoretical Weingartner & Draine SMC curve out to 700 Å, but the drop in attenuation at still shorter wavelengths is less than predicted. The identical <b>attenuation</b> <b>curve</b> for low-ionization BALQSOs (LoBALs) does not support them being a "break out" phase in the life of AGNs. Although attenuation in the optical due to BAL dust is low (E(B-V) ∼ 0. 03 - 0. 05), the attenuation rises to one magnitude in the EUV because of the steep extinction curve. Here the dust optical depth is at the optimum value for radiative acceleration of dusty gas. Because the spectral energy distribution of AGNs peaks in the EUV where the optical depth is highest, the force on the dust dominates the acceleration of BAL gas. For LoBALs we get a negative <b>attenuation</b> <b>curve</b> in the optical. This is naturally explained if there is more light scattered into our line of sight in LoBALs compared with non-BALQSOs.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a new study of dust {{attenuation}} at redshifts 3 < z < 4 based on a sample of 236 star-forming galaxies from the VANDELS spectroscopic survey. Motivated by results from the FiBY simulation project, we argue that the intrinsic SEDs of star-forming galaxies at these redshifts have a self-similar shape across the mass range 8. 2 ≤ log(M_/M_) ≤ 10. 6 probed by our sample. Using FiBY data, we construct a set of intrinsic SED templates which incorporate both detailed star formation and chemical abundance histories, and a variety of SPS model assumptions. With this set of physically-motivated intrinsic SED templates, we present a novel approach for directly recovering the shape and normalization of the dust <b>attenuation</b> <b>curve</b> using the ratio of the intrinsic and observed SEDs. We find, across all of the intrinsic templates considered, that the average <b>attenuation</b> <b>curve</b> for star-forming galaxies at z≃ 3. 5 is similar in shape to the commonly-adopted Calzetti starburst law, with an average total-to-selective attenuation ratio of R_V= 4. 18 ± 0. 29. In contrast, we find that an average <b>attenuation</b> <b>curve</b> as steep as the SMC extinction law is strongly disfavoured. We show that the optical attenuation (A_V) versus stellar mass (M_) relation predicted using our method is consistent with recent ALMA observations of galaxies at 2 <z< 3 in the HUDF, as well as empirical A_V - M_ relations predicted by a Calzetti-like law. In fact, our results, combined with other literature data, suggest that the A_V - M_ relation does not evolve over the redshift range 0 <z< 5, at least for galaxies with log(M_/M_) ≳ 9. 5. Finally, we present tentative evidence which suggests that the <b>attenuation</b> <b>curve</b> may become steeper at lower masses log(M_/M_) ≲ 9. 0.

40|$|Purpose Optimizing CT brain {{perfusion}} protocols is {{a challenge}} because of the complex interaction between image acquisition, calculation of perfusion data and patient hemodynamics. Several digital phantoms {{have been developed to}} avoid unnecessary patient exposure or suboptimum choice of parameters. We expand this idea by using realistic noise patterns and measured tissue <b>attenuation</b> <b>curves</b> representing patient-specific hemodynamics. The purpose of this work is to validate that this approach can realistically simulate mean perfusion values and noise on perfusion data for individual patients. Materials and Methods The proposed 4 D digital phantom consists of three major components: 1) a definition of the spatial structure of various brain tissues within the phantom, 2) measured tissue <b>attenuation</b> <b>curves</b> and 3) measured noise patterns. Tissue <b>attenuation</b> <b>curves</b> were measured in patient data using regions of interest (ROIs) in gray matter and white matter. By assigning the tissue <b>attenuation</b> <b>curves</b> to the corresponding tissue curves within the phantom, patient-specific CTP acquisitions were retrospectively simulated. Noise patterns were acquired by repeatedly scanning an anthropomorphic skull phantom at various exposure settings. We selected 20 consecutive patients that were scanned for suspected ischemic stroke and constructed patient-specific 4 D digital phantoms using the individual patients' hemodynamics. We compared the perfusion maps of the patient data with the digital phantom data. Agreement between phantom- and patient-derived data was determined for mean perfusion values and for standard deviation in de perfusion data using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and a linear fit. Results ICCs ranged between 0. 92 - 0. 99 for mean perfusion values. ICCs for the standard deviation in perfusion maps were between 0. 86 - 0. 93. Linear fitting yielded slope values between 0. 90 - 1. 06.

We use data in the CDFS, obtained in intermediate and broad band filters by the MUSYC project, to sample the UV rest-frame of 751 galaxies with 0. 95 <z< 2. 2. When available, Herschel/PACS data (GOODS-Herschel project), and Spitzer/MIPS measurements, are used to estimate the dust emission. The SED of each source is fit using the CIGALE code. The amount of dust attenuation and the dust <b>attenuation</b> <b>curve</b> are obtained as outputs of the SED fitting process, together with other parameters linked to the SFH. The global amount of dust attenuation at UV wavelengths is found to increase with stellar mass and to decrease as UV luminosity increases. A UV bump at 2175 A is securely detected in 20 % of the galaxies, and the mean amplitude of the bump for the sample {{is similar to that}} observed in the LMC supershell region. This amplitude is found to be lower in galaxies with very high SSFRs, and 90 % of the galaxies exhibiting a secure bump are at z< 1. 5.

The simulated galaxies at z≃ 5, which have M_ 1500 ≤ - 18. 0 and 7. 5 ≤log(M/M_) ≤ 10. 2, display a mass-dependent α-enhancement, with a median value of [α/Fe]_z= 5 ≃ 4 × [α/Fe]_Z_. The median Fe/H ratio of the simulated galaxies is 0. 14 ± 0. 05 which, even including the effects of nebular continuum, produces steep intrinsic UV continuum slopes; 〈β_i〉 = - 2. 4 ± 0. 05. Using a set of simple dust attenuation models, in which the wavelength-dependent attenuation is assumed to be of the form A(λ) ∝λ^n, we explore the parameter values which best reproduce the observed z= 5 luminosity function (LF) and colour-magnitude relation (CMR). We find that a simple model in which the absolute UV attenuation is a linearly increasing function of log stellar mass, and the dust attenuation slope (n) is within the range - 0. 7 ≤ n ≤- 0. 3, can successfully reproduce the LF and CMR over a wide range of stellar population synthesis model (SPS) assumptions. This range of <b>attenuation</b> <b>curves</b> is consistent with a power-law fit to the Calzetti attenuation law in the UV (n=- 0. 55), and other similarly `grey' star-forming galaxy <b>attenuation</b> <b>curves</b> recently derived at z≃ 2.

Finally, we show that our models are consistent with recent 1. 3 mm ALMA observations of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), and predict the form of the z≃ 5 IRX-β relation.

40|$|Relative abundances of {{individual}} Iron-secondary elements have been measured using a balloon-borne 6. 6 m ster ionization/Cerenkov detector system. The unusually large geometry factor and single-charge resolution yield empirical atmospheric <b>attenuation</b> <b>curves</b> for individual elements which combine with high statistics at float altitude to yield individual element abundances, extrapolated {{to the top}} of the atmosphere, with high precision. Results are presented for top-of-the-atmosphere abundances (relative to iron) {{of individual}} elements in the Z range 13 - 30...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, the {{propagation}} characteristics of visco-elastic, Rayleigh-like waves {{generated by a}} laser pulse are analyzed theoretically. Based on general visco-elastic theory and regarded the visco-elastic media as a Kelvin mode, the characterization frequency equations are found {{by means of the}} Laplace/Hankel transform, and transient displacement of the visco-elastic, Rayleigh-like wave is derived; the dispersion and <b>attenuation</b> <b>curves</b> due to viscosity are calculated numerically. It is shown that the dispersion of visco-elastic Rayleigh-like wave is associated with the magnitude of viscosity. In the presence of a “weak viscosity,” the viscosity has little influence on phase velocity, and the attenuation of the wave is approximately proportional to the viscosity modulus. The effect of shear viscosity on attenuation is much more than that of bulk viscosity. The transient responses of the visco-elastic, Rayleigh-like wave were also simulated by the Laplace and Hankel inverse transforms, from which the effect of viscosity on the Rayleigh-like wave is clearly shown; the simulated transient response results are also in good agreement with the dispersion and <b>attenuation</b> <b>curves.</b> The approach used here was the model we develop which may provide a useful tool for the determination of the visco-elastic parameters of the material.|$|R
