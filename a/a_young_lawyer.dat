5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>lawyer</b> Chelvanayakam was not {{involved}} in politics but when the ACTC was established in 1944 he became one of its principal organisers. Ponnambalam was the ACTC's president and Chelvanayakam was effectively his deputy. Chelvanayakam was part of the delegation, led by Ponnambalam, to the Soulbury Commission which argued unsuccessfully for balanced representation. Chelvanayakam stood as the ACTC candidate for Kankesanthurai in the 1947 parliamentary election. He won the election and entered Parliament.|$|E
5|$|He {{particularly}} admired Solomon Sharp, <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>lawyer</b> in {{his thirties}} in Bowling Green, with whom Beauchamp hoped to study. In 1820, Beauchamp became disenchanted with Sharp when rumors surfaced that he had fathered an illegitimate child with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter who lived in Bowling Green. Sharp denied paternity of the child, which was stillborn.|$|E
5|$|In June 1935 Calleia was {{announced}} to star as Joaquin Murrieta in I Am Joaquin (later titled Robin Hood of El Dorado), a film {{for which he}} had written the screenplay. MGM replaced him with Warner Baxter, ostensibly because Calleia was too old, although Baxter was six years older. Calleia did receive a notable starring role in Man of the People (1937), a political drama about <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>lawyer</b> fighting corporate racketeers.|$|E

5|$|Kruger's final {{administration}} was, Meintjes suggests, {{the strongest}} {{in the history}} of the republic. He had the former Free State President FW Reitz as State Secretary from June 1898 and Leyds, who set up an office in Brussels, as Envoy Extraordinary in Europe. The post of State Attorney was given to <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>lawyer</b> from the Cape called Jan Smuts, for whom Kruger presaged great things. The removal of Leyds to Europe marked the end of Kruger's longstanding policy of giving important government posts to Dutchmen; convinced of Cape Afrikaners' sympathy following the Jameson Raid, he preferred them from this point on.|$|E
5|$|The Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy (sometimes {{called the}} Kentucky Tragedy) was {{the murder of}} Kentucky {{legislator}} Solomon P. Sharp by Jereboam O. Beauchamp (bee-chum). As <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>lawyer,</b> Beauchamp had been an admirer of Sharp until Sharp allegedly fathered an illegitimate child with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter. Sharp denied paternity of the stillborn child. Later, Beauchamp began a relationship with Cooke, who agreed to marry him {{on the condition that}} he kill Sharp to avenge her honor. Beauchamp and Cooke married in June 1824, and in the early morning of November 7, 1825, Beauchamp murdered Sharp at Sharp's home in Frankfort.|$|E

5|$|The {{theme of}} <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>lawyer</b> being {{fed up with}} a giant law firm and bolting away to a less lucrative but more {{satisfying}} career is shared with The Associate. The theme of a lawsuit against a giant corporation appeared in The Runaway Jury, but in the present book, the corporation is vindicated and proven to have been unjustly maligned (at least on the specific drug which {{is the subject of}} the lawsuit) and the mass tort lawyers are seen as greedy and unscrupulous, ultimately bolting and leaving the protagonist's tiny Chicago firm in the lurch.|$|E
5|$|In the at-large races, the two {{incumbent}} Democratic candidates, Victor E. Moore and Paul D'Ortona, led the ticket. Three other Democrats {{were also}} elected: John F. Byrne, Sr., {{who had previously}} been councilman for the 10th district; Henry W. Sawyer, a civil rights lawyer; and Marshall L. Shepard, a clergyman who had served as Commissioner of Records. On the Republican side, incumbent at-large councilman Louis Schwartz was re-elected. The other Republican incumbent, Donald C. Rubel, who had won a special election as an independent Republican backed by Democrats, lost his spot to Thomas M. Foglietta, <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>lawyer</b> and son of former councilman Michael Foglietta. Also losing bids for the Republican at-large seats were real estate assessor F. Raymond Heuges and former magistrate Hobson R. Reynolds.|$|E
5|$|Morrow {{opened his}} {{practice}} in Lexington. He established his reputation {{in one of}} his first casesthe trial of William Moseby, a black man accused of murder. Moseby's first trial had ended in a hung jury, but because the evidence against him included a confession (which he later recanted), most observers believed he would be convicted in his second trial. Unable to find a defense lawyer for Moseby, the judge in the case turned to Morrow, who as <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>lawyer</b> was eager for work. Morrow proved that his client's testimony had been extorted; he had been told that a lynch mob waited outside the jail for him, but no such mob had ever existed. Morrow further showed that other testimony against his client was false. Moseby was acquitted September 21, 1902.|$|E

5|$|Born into an {{expatriate}} Ceylon Tamil {{family in}} Malaya, Chelvanayakam moved to Ceylon while still young. He {{worked as a}} teacher before studying law at Ceylon Law College and qualifying as lawyer. A successful career in civil law saw him becoming a King's Counsel and being offered {{a position on the}} Supreme Court, which he rejected. As <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>lawyer</b> Chelvanayakam was not involved in politics but when the British established the Soulbury Commission to look into constitutional reform in Ceylon he and other Tamil people formed the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) to represent Tamil interests. He was elected to Parliament in 1947 to represent Kankesanthurai, a constituency he would represent until his death, except for a period between 1952 and 1956. Chelvanayakam left the ACTC over the party's decision to join the government and in 1949 founded his own party, ITAK, also known as the Federal Party.|$|E
5|$|Already in 1878, voices sounded for Reitz {{to run for}} the presidency, but President Brand's {{position}} was still very strong and Reitz openly praised his qualities and refused to stand against him. In the late 1870s and early 1880s the political temperature ran high in the Orange Free State. The annexation of the South African Republic (Transvaal) by the British in 1877 and the First Anglo-Boer War of 1880–1881 in which that republic regained its autonomy impacted deeply on political sentiments in the Orange Free State. On the one hand there were those who propagated caution in the relationship with the British, on the other there developed a political movement that strongly propagated a (reawakened) Afrikaner national consciousness. Reitz was part of the latter, and together with C.L.F. Borckenhagen, editor of the Bloemfontein Express newspaper, he wrote a constitution for the Afrikaner Bond (Afrikaner Union), a political party originally set up by leading Afrikaner politicians in the Cape Colony, like Rev S.J. du Toit and his Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners ('Society of True Afrikaners') and Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr and the Zuidafrikaansche Boeren Beschermings Vereeniging ('South African Boer Protection Association'). Among the supporters of this new Afrikaner nationalism in the Orange Free State was also Reitz's successor, M.T. Steyn, then still <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>lawyer.</b> The constitution was presented in April 1881, and several months later Reitz became the chairman of the Bond. His overt political activities earned Reitz criticism from those who feared a breakdown of relations with the British. It is obvious, however, that a wind of change was blowing through the Boer republics and among the Afrikaners in the Cape Colony, which was to change Anglo-Boer relations drastically.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, Eddie Shore's oft-capricious and {{notoriously}} miserly ownership style caused increasing friction {{with his}} players, who staged wildcat strikes in 1966 and 1967. Representing them, <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>lawyer</b> named Alan Eagleson gained prominence, {{and went on}} to form the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA).|$|E

25|$|How she met Pierce, <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>lawyer</b> with {{political}} ambitions, is unknown, but her brother-in-law Alpheus S. Packard {{was one of}} Pierce's instructors at Bowdoin.

Jane's family was opposed to the union due to Pierce's political ambitions. The Reverend Silas Aiken, Jane's brother-in-law, conducted the small ceremony. The couple honeymooned six days at the boardinghouse of Sophia Southurt near Washington, D.C..|$|E
