5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we <b>all</b> <b>did,</b> that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Monroe {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for being difficult on film sets; the difficulties worsened as her career progressed. She was often late or did not show up at <b>all,</b> <b>did</b> not remember her lines, and would demand several re-takes before she was satisfied with her performance. Monroe's dependence on her acting coaches—first Natasha Lytess and later Paula Strasberg—also irritated directors. Monroe's problems have been attributed to a combination of perfectionism, low self-esteem, and stage fright; she disliked the lack of control she had on her work on film sets, and never experienced similar problems during photo shoots, in which she had more say over her performance and could be more spontaneous instead of following a script. To alleviate her anxiety and chronic insomnia, she began to use barbiturates, amphetamines and alcohol, which also exacerbated her problems, although she did not become severely addicted until 1956. According to Sarah Churchwell, some of Monroe's behavior especially later in her career was also in response to the condescension and sexism of her male co-stars and directors. Similarly, Lois Banner has stated that she was bullied by many of her directors.|$|E

5|$|The 2007 Draft {{marked the}} first time three players drafted in the top 10 came from the same school: the University of Florida. Florida, the 2007 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Basketball champion, tied the record set by the University of Connecticut in 2006 with five players {{selected}} in the first two rounds of an NBA draft. Florida joined nine other schools, including Connecticut, that had five players selected in an NBA draft, second only to UNLV, which had six players selected in the eighth-round 1977 draft. Five players who competed in the 2007 NCAA Basketball National Championship Final were selected in the top 10; three players came from Florida, and two players came from the runner-up, Ohio State University. This draft also set the record number of freshmen drafted in the first round when eight freshmen were selected. Of the 60 players drafted, eight were freshmen, five were sophomores, 14 were juniors, 20 were seniors, and 13 were international players without U.S. college basketball experience. The Cleveland Cavaliers, Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers and Toronto Raptors <b>all</b> <b>did</b> not have a draft pick this year, although Indiana and Toronto each acquired a drafted player's rights after the draft.|$|E
5|$|The Crown was at {{the centre}} of {{government}} in late medieval Scotland. The unification of the kingdom, the spread of Anglo-Norman custom, {{the development of a}} European trading economy and Robert I's success in achieving independence from England, <b>all</b> <b>did</b> much to build up the prestige of the institution. However, its authority within the kingdom was not unchallenged, not least from the many semi-independent lordships and it endured a series of crisis, particularly frequent minorities and resulting regencies. All of this, in addition to the relative poverty of the kingdom and the lack of a system of regular taxation, helped to limit the scale of central administration and government. Much more than the English monarchy, the Scottish court remained a largely itinerant institution, with the king moving between royal castles, particularly Perth and Stirling, but also holding judicial sessions throughout the kingdom, with Edinburgh only beginning to emerge as the capital in the reign of James III at the cost of considerable unpopularity. Like most western European monarchies, the Scottish Crown in the 15th century adopted the example of the Burgundian court, through formality and elegance putting itself at the centre of culture and political life, defined with display, ritual and pageantry, reflected in elaborate new palaces and patronage of the arts.|$|E

25|$|Soon the {{majority}} of the minicomputer and mainframe vendors instigated projects to combine the two, producing an OOP library format that could be used anywhere.

25|$|Crosby was a keen {{fisherman}} {{especially in}} his younger days {{but it was}} a pastime that he enjoyed throughout his life.

25|$|The ansar (helpers of Muhammad and the muhajirun) held {{a meeting}} to discuss {{choosing}} a new leader of their part of the community. When news of the meeting spread, Abu Bakr, Umar and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah rushed to the scene. Abu Bakr argued that if the ansar chose a leader of themselves only, the Muslim community would split; the new leader must come from the Quraysh (Muhammad's tribe), and Sa'd ibn Ubadah agreed. Abu Bakr suggested that the people should choose Umar or Abu Ubayda, since both were capable. Umar took Abu Bakr's hand and declared his allegiance (bay'ah, an Arabian custom), followed {{by the rest of}} the gathering. However, this decision would not have been binding on the rest of the Muslims unless they gave their bay'ah (which <b>all</b> <b>did,</b> except Ali's supporters).|$|E

25|$|In 1960, Brower {{launched}} the Exhibit Format book series with This Is the American Earth, and in 1962 In Wildness Is the Preservation of the World, with color photographs by Eliot Porter. These coffee-table books, published by their Sierra Club Books division, introduced the Sierra Club {{to a wider}} audience. Fifty thousand copies were sold {{in the first four}} years, and by 1960 sales exceeded $10 million. Soon Brower was publishing two new titles a year in the Exhibit Format series, but not <b>all</b> <b>did</b> as well as In Wildness. Although the books were successful in introducing the public to wilderness preservation and the Sierra Club, they lost money for the organization, some $60,000 a year after 1964. Financial management became a matter of contention between Brower and his board of directors.|$|E
25|$|It's {{tougher to}} {{be a young}} writer today than when I was a young writer. I don't think my first novel would have been {{published}} today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we <b>all</b> <b>did</b> some work on the book and it was published. I don't think publishers {{have that kind of}} tolerance these days, and I guess possibly as a result, more writers go to writing class now than then. I think first, fiction, and second, novels, are much more refined in terms of language, but they may tend to be too well behaved, almost in response to the narrower market.|$|E
25|$|It was {{originally}} planned to withdraw these final two locomotives on 31 December 2004. However, <b>all</b> <b>did</b> {{not go to}} plan, as the replacement Class 90 locomotives did not prove to be as reliable as hoped. Therefore, two locomotives were reprieved until at least March 2005. A final twist saw no. 86232 repaired, replacing no. 86246, which had again suffered from a serious failure. A third locomotive, no. 86234, was also repaired and briefly returned to traffic in April 2005, but was later stored again after failing. The last two locomotives (nos. 86232/235) saw occasional use, when not enough Class 90 locomotives were available. By mid-2005, no. 86232 was out of use and no. 86235 was operational but not used. The final use of the class came on 17 September 2005, when no. 86235 was used on several Norwich-London return trips to mark its retirement from service. This has brought an end to 40 years of Class 86-hauled passenger trains.|$|E
