60|$|Cecil {{was walking}} restlessly up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> when she entered. He drew her eagerly into the library.|$|E
60|$|The cowboy seemed {{galvanized}} into action. He leaped over Hardman's body, huddled and lax, <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> {{pulling his}} guns.|$|E
60|$|Dashing blindly {{into the}} house, he almost ran into Mr. Scogan, who was walking up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> smoking a final pipe.|$|E
60|$|Pothinus {{appears in}} <b>the</b> loggia, <b>and</b> comes <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> very haughtily to Caesar's left hand.|$|R
6000|$|Ken strode out of <b>the</b> room <b>and</b> started <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> [...] "Come on!" [...] he called, grimly, <b>and</b> ran <b>down</b> <b>the</b> stairs. Graves {{hesitated a}} moment, then followed.|$|R
50|$|Later, Martha's {{behavior}} allegedly {{became even}} more strange: She would wait until the lights were out, {{and then she would}} visit one dormitory after another, never saying a word but staring into space as if she were in a trance. As time passed, she took to walking up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls</b> during <b>the</b> darkest hours of the night. Often she would alarm the girls by opening and closing their doors, then hurrying away to resume her pitiful promenade.|$|R
60|$|I walked restlessly up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> for ten minutes. Then a lady's maid {{suddenly}} appeared through a green baize door and beckoned {{me to follow}} her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my dear, what is it?" [...] asked Dr. Alec, who was [...] "planking the deck," [...] as {{he called}} his daily {{promenade}} up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He {{was eager}} to see Elsie and was pacing impatiently up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> when Lawson met him, smiling, imperturbable. [...] "Well, Captain, how are you this morning?" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{he rushed}} forward. Winter and the housecarles formed round him and <b>the</b> women, <b>and</b> hurried <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> while <b>the</b> savages hurried up the ladder, to quarrel over their spoil.|$|R
60|$|But dear, fat Cordy was {{the most}} {{successful}} of all; and rejoiced greatly {{over the loss of}} a few pounds when she gave up over-eating, long naps, and lazy habits. Exercise became a sort of mania with her, and she was continually trudging off for a constitutional, or trotting up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls</b> when bad weather prevented the daily tramp. It was the desire of her soul to grow thin, and such was her ardor that Miss Orne had to check her sometimes, lest she should overdo the matter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can naught be done, Marmaduke?" [...] {{she asked}} after a slight pause, {{during which she}} had watched anxiously the restless figure of her {{brother-in-law}} as he paced up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> narrow <b>hall.</b>|$|R
60|$|Lane {{left the}} room, to pace up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> outside. His {{thoughts}} seemed deadlocked. By and bye, Doctor Bronson {{came out with}} Doctor Wallace, who was evidently leaving.|$|E
60|$|Iduna {{looked around}} her with astonishment, then threw herself upon a couch, {{and burst into}} tears. The Prince of Athens walked up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> {{with an air of}} {{determined}} coolness.|$|E
60|$|The robed and close-cowled harlequins entered. The grim Leonardo sate {{in state}} {{at the head of}} his council board. Ranged up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> on either hand stood near a hundred men-at-arms.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Down</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> Four In Line: Two couples join {{hands so}} that they form a line of four, <b>and</b> walk <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> or away from the music. Sometimes the {{two people in the}} center twirl those on the side, but this is optional.|$|R
40|$|The bar {{also served}} as an hotel desk. The tall American was on the top floor, the old man told Jon, but only paying guests were {{permitted}} upstairs. He'd send up a girl to get him. Jon asked if only paying guests could take a leak and pushed the swinging doors aside <b>and</b> ambled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> <b>The</b> bar {{also served as}} an hotel desk.

60|$|He {{ran toward}} {{her with a}} {{heightened}} color and outstretched hands. But she whipped her own behind her, glanced rapidly up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> long <b>hall,</b> <b>and</b> stood looking {{at him with a}} half-audacious, half-mischievous admiration, in utter contrast to her old reserve.|$|R
60|$|The Vicomte {{turned away}} to greet a little party {{of friends who}} had just entered. Duncombe strolled back to the hotel, and found Spencer walking restlessly up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> waiting for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tired of frivolity, my dear?" [...] {{asked her}} uncle, pausing in his walk up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> {{to glance at}} her with a quick, bright look she liked to bring into his eyes.|$|E
60|$|Sir John {{poured out}} and drank a fourth cup of ale, then set to walking up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> Presently he halted {{in front of}} the fire and {{addressed}} it as though it were his enemy.|$|E
50|$|According to Windham and {{historian}} Daniel Barefoot, there {{have actually been}} two ghosts alleged to have haunted Huntingdon College. They {{first appeared in the}} late nineteenth century, while the college was still located in the town of Tuskegee, Alabama. She was described as a young woman wearing a scarlet dress and carrying a scarlet parasol who walked wordlessly up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls</b> of a women's dormitory late one night, bathed in a red glow. This apparition, according to Windham, ultimately left <b>the</b> residence <b>hall</b> and disappeared from view as she passed through a gateway outside. The alleged identity or origin of this wraith has never been determined, and she was apparently never seen again.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There, {{after they}} had {{scattered}} his pack up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Hall,</b> some young knights carried him to an upper room, and dropped him into a well in a wall, that rose and fell with the tide. They called him Joseph, and threw torches at his wet head. Why not?' ...|$|R
50|$|In this {{experiment}} a magnet {{is connected to}} the lower flexible tube. As the bladder begins to oscillate the lower part begins to move vertically up <b>and</b> <b>down.</b> Subsequently <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> sensor measures <b>the</b> change in anisotropic magnetoresistance and gives a graph which shows the vertical variation in militesla.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{inform you}} of {{any change in}} the odds showing." [...] Reinhart strode past her, out of the office <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> He headed toward the SRB room, an intense thalamic {{excitement}} rising up inside him.|$|E
6000|$|Then he {{went away}} to talk quite cheerfully to Aunt Peace about its being [...] "only a chill"; after which he tramped up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> pulling his beard and {{knitting}} his brows, sure signs of great inward perturbation.|$|E
60|$|Jean {{gave him}} a {{significant}} look, shrugged her shoulders, and went away smiling her odd smile, while Coventry paced up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> in a curious state of unrest, which made him forgetful of everything till the young people came gaily out to supper.|$|E
60|$|Madame Cerise {{laid down}} her book, placed her {{pince-nez}} in the case, <b>and</b> slowly proceeded <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> <b>The</b> door shook with another powerful impact, a voice cried out demanding admittance.|$|R
5000|$|According to Louisiana Department of Corrections policy, inmates {{on death}} row are held in solitary {{confinement}} during the entire time they are incarcerated, even if appeals take years. This means that they are severely isolated and confined to their windowless cells for 23 hours per day. For one hour per day an inmate may take a shower and/or move up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls</b> under escort. Three times a week an inmate is permitted to use the exercise yard. Death row inmates are allowed to have several books at a time, and each inmate may have one five-minute personal telephone call per month. They may not participate in education or work programs. Death row inmates receive unlimited visitor access. Officers patrol the death row corridors nightly as a suicide prevention tactic.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will take}} you home another way. I {{will take you}} over what they call <b>the</b> Common, <b>and</b> come <b>down</b> behind <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> into <b>the</b> gardens." ...|$|R
60|$|Without a word, {{he entered}} the castle, and there strode up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> his hands playing with the {{fastenings}} of his cloak, until suddenly throwing himself on a bench, he drew his mantle over his face, turned it to the wall, and became lost in deep musings.|$|E
6000|$|He went {{on up the}} stairs. For {{the first}} time Mr. Keller began to pity the {{harmless}} little man whom he had hitherto disliked. [...] "Poor wretch!" [...] he said to himself, as he paced up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> [...] "what will become of him, if she does die?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{opposite}} {{door opened}} and a light flooded the hall. From where the girl stood in the dark drawing-room she could see Miss Stearne standing in her doorway and listening. Mary Louise held herself motionless. She scarcely dared breathe. The principal glanced up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> noted the locked doors and presently retired into her room, after a little while extinguishing the light.|$|E
60|$|Footprints--{{footprints}}--the footprints of one dead. How ghastly {{they look}} as they fall before me! Up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> long <b>hall</b> they go, and I follow them. Pit, pat they fall, those unearthly steps, and beneath them starts up that awful impress. I {{can see it}} grow upon the marble, a damp and dreadful thing.|$|R
6000|$|After {{everybody}} had gone home, Dr. Alec paced up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>hall</b> in <b>the</b> twilight for an hour, thinking so intently that sometimes he frowned, sometimes he smiled, {{and more than}} once he stood still in a brown study. All {{of a sudden he}} said, half aloud, as if he had made up his mind, ...|$|R
60|$|Herfrida laughed lightly, {{while her}} warlike son {{strutted}} up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> ancestral <b>hall</b> like a bantam cock, frowning and grunting indignantly, as he brooded over the dark prospects of peace that threatened his native land, {{and thought of}} his own incapacity, on account of youth, to make glorious hay while yet the sun of war was shining.|$|R
