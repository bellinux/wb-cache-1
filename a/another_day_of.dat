5|$|After {{returning}} to Australia in February 1944, following {{a short period}} in staff positions Graham spent {{the remainder of the}} war in the South-West Pacific. Seconded to the infantry, in December 1944 he was given command of a company from the 24th Battalion and went on to distinguish himself during the Bougainville campaign in 1945. During an action on the morning of 17 April C Company, under Graham's command, encountered heavy resistance in thick jungle while attacking strong Japanese positions around Andersons Junction, astride Dawe Creek. Personally leading the attack, he placed a number of anti-tank guns to cover a river crossing and following heavy fighting the Australians finally secured a foothold by late in the afternoon which allowed a bridge to be erected across the creek for the tanks to move forward in support. After repelling a Japanese counter-attack overnight, the following morning Graham led his company forward and succeeded in seizing the high ground after <b>another</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> bitter fighting that resulted in heavy Japanese casualties. He was immediately awarded the Military Cross (MC) for his leadership. Graham was later wounded amid heavy fighting in difficult terrain as the Australian advance continued along the Buin Road in May. Promoted temporary major in October 1945, he finished the war posted to the 2/4th Armoured Regiment.|$|E
5|$|In 1648, the Fronde insurrection {{broke out}} in Paris, {{prompted}} by high taxes, increased food prices and disease. The Parlement of Paris, the Regency government of Anne of Austria and rebellious noble factions fought for several years {{to take control of}} the city and wider power. On 26 August, during the period known as the First Fronde, Anne ordered the arrest of some of the leaders of the Parlement of Paris; violence flared as a result, and the 27 August became known as <b>another</b> <b>Day</b> <b>of</b> the Barricades. The governor of the Bastille loaded and readied his guns to fire on the Hôtel de Ville, controlled by the parliament, although the decision was eventually taken not to shoot. Barricades were erected across the city and the royal government fled in September, leaving a garrison of 22 men behind in the Bastille. On 11 January 1649, the Fronde decided to take the Bastille, giving the task to Elbeuf, one of their leaders. Elbeuf's attack required only a token effort: five or six shots were fired at the Bastille, before it promptly surrendered on the 13 January. Pierre Broussel, one of the Fronde leaders, appointed his son as the governor and the Fronde retained it even after the ceasefire that March.|$|E

25|$|The narrator's {{standards}} for {{what constitutes a}} cliffhanger seem broader than in modern literature.

A teaser for the ad had appeared two weeks prior to the Super Bowl, which had created rumors of a possible film sequel. It was produced by Santa Monica-based RPA and directed by Todd Phillips.

500|$|At Cornwallis's {{request for}} a {{diversion}} in Virginia to draw attention and resources from Greene, General Clinton in December 1780 despatched Brigadier General Benedict Arnold (who had changed sides the previous September) with 1,600 men to Virginia. [...] Arnold's instructions were to destroy Continental Army supplies and storage depots in that state, which had largely avoided military conflict before 1780, and then to establish a base for future operations at Portsmouth. [...] On the afternoon of 4 January, Arnold sailed up the James River and landed his force at Westover, Virginia. [...] Moving rapidly with an overnight forced march, he raided Richmond, the state capital, the next day. [...] After <b>another</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> raiding, {{he returned to his}} boats and sailed to Portsmouth, which he then proceeded to fortify. [...] The land approaches to this base were guarded by Virginia militia under the command of Brigadier General Peter Muhlenberg, but these were inexperienced as well as relatively small in number, and could not prevent the movement of British troops by ship on the readily navigable rivers in the area.|$|E

[...] The next day a second battery opened fire from [...] further along the same trench, creating a crossfire. [...] The effect of the garrison's return fire was limited to driving French guards from the trenches, and some of the fort's guns either were dismounted or burst owing to the stress of use. [...] On 7 August, Montcalm sent Bougainville to the fort under a truce flag to deliver the intercepted dispatch. [...] By then the fort's walls had been breached, many of its guns were useless, and the garrison had taken many casualties.

500|$|Monday 10 May saw <b>another</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> {{talks between}} the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, but at a meeting with his MPs, Nick Clegg was urged to give assurances over offers which were being made by David Cameron's team. They also wished him to {{continue}} negotiations with Labour. During the day it emerged that senior Labour and Liberal Democrat representatives had held discussions about forming a coalition, but {{that one of the}} barriers to this was the continued presence of Gordon Brown as Prime Minister. At 5.00pm that afternoon Brown announced that he would step down as Labour leader by September. In a statement he said that he intended to [...] "sk the Labour Party to set in train the processes needed for its own leadership election." [...] The statement went on to say, [...] "I would hope that it would be completed in time for the new leader to be in post {{by the time of the}} Labour Party conference. I will play no part in that contest, I will back no individual candidate." [...] He also urged any prospective candidates for the position to wait until coalition negotiations were complete before announcing their candidacy. Following this announcement, formal talks began between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, but many in the Party felt that a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition was an unrealistic prospect since it would still fall short of the 326 seats needed to form a majority government, with 315 seats to the Conservatives' 306. Labour MP Graham Stringer said, [...] "I don't think it makes sense in the arithmetic–the numbers don't add up." [...] However, in his account of Labour's negotiations with the Liberal Democrats, Andrew Adonis – who participated in the talks – writes that the general consensus among members of Gordon Brown's cabinet was that {{talks between the}} Conservatives and Liberal Democrats would reach an impasse. [...] " [...] process would turn to our favour once the Tories and Lib Dems had rehearsed the extent of their differences".|$|E
