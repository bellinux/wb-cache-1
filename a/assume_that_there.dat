Given this endowment bundle (c,f), the Pareto efficient bundle can be determined at the mutual tangency of Crusoe's and Friday's indifference curves in the Edgeworth box along the Pareto Set (Contract curve). These are the bundles at which Crusoe's and Friday's Marginal rate of substitution are equal.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{realistic}} for the Court to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are unlimited funds {{to address the}} needs of all. A judicial approach on this basis would tend to make a government reluctant to create any new social benefit schemes because their limits would depend on an accurate prediction of the outcome of court proceedings under s. 15(1) of the Charter.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} to lie is noted early and nearly universally in human development. Social psychology and developmental psychology {{are concerned with}} the theory of mind, which people employ to simulate another's reaction to their story and determine if a lie will be believable. The most commonly cited milestone, what is known as Machiavellian intelligence, is at the age of about four and a half years, when children begin to be able to lie convincingly. Before this, they seem simply unable to comprehend why others do not see the same view of events that they doâ€“ and seem to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is only one point of view, which is their own.|$|E

25|$|Dreyfus also {{identified}} a subtler assumption about the world. AI researchers (and futurists and science fiction writers) often <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is {{no limit to}} formal, scientific knowledge, because they assume that any phenomenon in the universe can be described by symbols or scientific theories. This assumes that everything that exists {{can be understood as}} objects, properties of objects, classes of objects, relations of objects, and so on: precisely those things that can be described by logic, language and mathematics. The question of what exists is called ontology, and so Dreyfus calls this the ontological assumption. If this is false, then it raises doubts about what we can ultimately know and what intelligent machines will ultimately be able to help us to do.|$|E
25|$|Common {{criticisms of}} the Copenhagen {{interpretation}} often lead {{to the problem of}} continuum of random occurrences: whether in time (as subsequent measurements, which under certain interpretations of the measurement problem may happen continuously) or even in space. A recent experiment showed that a particle may leave a trace about the path which it used when travelling as a wave ndash& and that this trace exhibits equality of both paths. If such result is raised to the rank of a wave-only non-transactional worldview and proved better ndash& i.e. that a particle is in fact a continuum of points capable of acting independently but under a common wavefunction ndash& it would rather support theories such as Bohm's one (with its guiding towards the centre of orbital and spreading of physical properties over it) than interpretations which presuppose full randomness, because with the latter it will be problematic to demonstrate universally and in all practical cases how can a particle remain coherent in time, in spite of non-zero probabilities of its individual points going into regions distant from the centre of mass (through a continuum of different random determinations). An alternative possibility would be to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a finite number of instants/points within a given time or area, but theories which try to quantize the space or time itself seem to be fatally incompatible with the special relativity.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} sealed orders were {{warnings}} of possible Spanish men {{of war in}} San Luis d'Apra, the main port of Guam, and notification of it being protected by a heavy battery of guns. The existence of the heavy armament was verified by reputable travelers who had visited the island within {{the two or three}} years before 1898. Definite information {{of the size of the}} Spanish garrison was not given, and in the absence of direct knowledge, the captain of the cruiser had to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> might be more than a thousand fighting men on the island who were thoroughly familiar with the terrain. Glass held a conference on the Australia, and invited General Anderson, Commander William C. Gibson, naval officer in charge of the transports, and the captains of the three troop carriers were invited to participate in the discussions. Also present at the meeting was T. A. Hallet, third officer of the Australia and a former whaling captain, who had been to the Mariana Islands many times. Hallet told the group that on his last visit to Guam, San Luis d'Apra was strongly fortified. Fort Santa Cruz and the battery on Point Orote, he stated, were efficiently manned and equipped. After a complete appraisal of all the known and unknown factors in the impending battle, the officers completed the arrangements for the attack on Guam.|$|E

500|$|In equal {{protection}} cases, {{the purpose of}} the law must be distilled before the reasonableness of a classification can be judged. When {{the purpose of the}} law is not explicitly stated, the court may conclude that there is no legitimate public purpose, <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a legitimate public purpose but refuse to look for it, or draw some inferences as to what it is. When the purpose of the law is explicitly stated, the court may either accept it at face value; or challenge the integrity of the legislative declaration, looking behind the explicit purpose to determine the true purpose. In the latter situation, what is concerned is the discriminatory character of the legislation. The need to identify the legislative purpose has been said to involve the court in the [...] "thornier aspects of judicial review", because it must either [...] "uncritically and often unrealistically accept a legislative avowal at face value" [...] or [...] "challenge legislative integrity and push beyond the express statement into unconfined realms of inference". The court must then [...] "make a judgment as to the purity of legislative motive and ... determine the legitimacy of the end".|$|E

According to the club statement, [...] "the vast majority" [...] of Wimbledon fans were not from Merton and [...] "less than 20% of the 3,400 season ticket holders" [...] lived there. Milton Keynes was, the statement said, Wimbledon's [...] "last chance of financial survival"; the move's opponents did not properly appreciate the club's fiscal troubles and [...] "wrongly <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a viable alternative in south London."

500|$|Although Sgt. Pepper's was {{preceded by}} several albums that had begun to bridge the line between [...] "disposable" [...] pop and [...] "serious" [...] rock, it {{successfully}} gave an established [...] "commercial" [...] voice to an alternative youth culture and marked {{the point at which}} the LP record emerged as a creative format whose importance was equal to or greater than that of the single. Bill Bruford, a veteran of several progressive rock bands, said that Sgt. Pepper's transformed both musicians' ideas of what was possible and audiences' ideas of what was acceptable in music. He believed that: [...] "Without the Beatles, or someone else who had done what the Beatles did, it is fair to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> would have been no progressive rock." [...] In the aftermath of Sgt. Pepper, magazines such as Melody Maker drew a sharp line between [...] "pop" [...] and [...] "rock', thus eliminating the [...] "roll" [...] from [...] "rock and roll" [...] (which now refers to the 1950s style). The only artists who remained [...] "rock" [...] would be those who were considered at the vanguard of compositional forms, far from [...] "radio friendly" [...] standards, as Americans increasingly used the adjective [...] "progressive" [...] for groups like Jethro Tull, Family, East of Eden, Van Der Graaf Generator, and King Crimson.|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} to create an express trust without being aware that one is doing so, {{so long as the}} court can determine from the person's intention that a beneficial entitlement should be conferred which the law (or equity) will enforce. In the Constance case, Constance was described as a man of [...] "unsophisticated character" [...] who did not know he was creating a trustâ€“ nevertheless, the courts found that was what he had done. [...] In Re Kayford, the company involved took actions to protect its customers by moving their funds into a separate bank account. Even though they had never indicated a desire to create a trust, their intention had been in line with the purpose of a trust, and thus it was considered valid. Many trusts are formed through wills, which create additional issues when determining intention. In Re Hamilton, Lindley LJ set out the standard rule that to [...] "take the will you have to construe and see what it means, and if you {{come to the conclusion that}} no trust was intended you say so"; essentially that judges should not simply <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a trust. This literal approach was followed until the 1950s; since then, the judiciary have been more willing to interpret trust documents in such a way as to make the trusts valid rather than void. According to Byrnes v Kendle, the question that needs to be answered in determining whether a certainty of intention exists is [...] "What is the meaning of what the parties have said?" [...] and not [...] "What did the parties mean to say?" ...|$|E
