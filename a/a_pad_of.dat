5|$|The first egg {{is often}} laid when the nest {{is little more}} than <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> grass, and a further egg is laid on each {{subsequent}} day. Both sexes incubate the eggs, which start hatching after about 14days; all hatch with 48hours despite the extended laying period. The black, downy precocial chicks soon leave the nest but are fed and protected by the parents. Fledging occurs after four to six weeks, and the young can fly before they are fully grown. It is not known whether the African crake has a second brood, but the corn crake usually does. Where grass is not tall enough {{at the start of the}} season, the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill.|$|E
25|$|Rove beetles of {{the genus}} Stenus are very {{interesting}} insects. They are specialist predators of small invertebrates such as collembola. Their labium can shoot out from the head using blood pressure. The thin rod of the labium ends in <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> bristly hairs and hooks and between these hairs are small pores that exude an adhesive glue-like substance, which sticks to prey.|$|E
25|$|Even at Second Ypres, Germany, still {{unsure of}} the weapon's effectiveness, only issued {{breathing}} masks to the engineers handling the gas. At Ypres a Canadian medical officer, {{who was also a}} chemist, quickly identified the gas as chlorine and recommended that the troops urinate on a cloth and hold it over their mouth and nose. The first official equipment issued was similarly crude; <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> material, usually impregnated with a chemical, tied over the lower face. To protect the eyes from tear gas, soldiers were issued with gas goggles.|$|E

25|$|Insects gain kinetic energy, {{provided}} by the muscles, when they accelerate. When the wings begin to decelerate {{toward the end of}} the stroke, this energy must dissipate. During the downstroke, the kinetic energy is dissipated by the muscles themselves and is converted into heat (this heat is sometimes used to maintain core body temperature). Some insects are able to utilize the kinetic energy in the upward movement of the wings to aid in their flight. The wing joints of these insects contain <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> elastic, rubber-like protein called resilin. During the upstroke of the wing, the resilin is stretched. The kinetic energy of the wing is converted into potential energy in the stretched resilin, which stores the energy much like a spring. When the wing moves down, this energy is released and aids in the downstroke.|$|E
500|$|The Florida mouse {{has been}} called the gopher mouse because it shares the long, deep burrow of the gopher {{tortoise}} (Gopherus polyphemus). [...] The mouse makes nest chambers, small side passages, sometimes <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> oak leaves and wiregrasses for chamber floors, and small chimney openings in the roof of the burrow. [...] It uses these openings, the main entrance, and side passages for entrance to and exit from the burrow. [...] In the absence of gopher tortoise burrows, the mouse will use those of the oldfield mouse (Peromyscus polionotus) or will make its own.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the scenes}} {{were based on the}} actor's real-life talents as well as improvised. When Michael tells Pam to [...] "write this down", Jenna Fischer's {{response}} to the camera was improvised. [...] "I thought it was funny that I didn't have <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> paper but Michael was telling me to take notes," [...] she explained in her MySpace blog, [...] "so I just looked to the camera and showed my lack of pen and paper." [...] Jim's impression of Stanley in this episode was inspired by John Krasinski's actual talent of doing impressions on the set.|$|E

500|$|In a {{multiple}} fight situation the linesmen will normally break up fights together, one fight {{at a time}} using the same procedures for a single fight. The linesmen will {{communicate with each other}} which fight to break up. In {{a multiple}} fight situation the referee will stand in an area of the ice where he/she can have a full view of all the players and will write down—on <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> paper commonly known as a [...] "riot pad"—the numbers of the players that are involved in the fights, watching for situations that warrant additional penalties, such as players removing opponents' helmets, players participating in a second fight, players leaving a bench to participate in a fight, or third players into a fight. The referee will not normally break up a fight unless the linesmen need assistance, or a fight is occurring where a player has gained a significant advantage over the other player, leading to concerns of significant injury.|$|E
500|$|Breeding {{behavior}} commences with a courtship chase {{with the}} female running in a crouch, pursued by the male, who adopts a more upright stance and has his neck outstretched. The female may stop and lower her head and tail to allow copulation; this takes just a few seconds, but may be repeated several times in an hour. The nest is a shallow cup of grass leaves, sometimes with a loose canopy, built in a depression and hidden under a grass tussock or small bush; it may be on dry ground or slightly raised above standing water, or occasionally floating. The nest is about [...] across with the internal cup [...] deep, and [...] wide. The clutch size is from 3 to 11 pink-coloured eggs; the first is often laid when the nest {{is little more than}} <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> grass, and a further egg is laid on each subsequent day. Both sexes incubate, and the eggs start hatching after about 14days; all hatch with 48hours despite the extended laying period. The black, downy precocial chicks soon leave the nest but are fed and protected by the parents. Fledging occurs after four to five weeks, and the young can fly before they are fully grown. It is not known whether a second brood is raised.|$|E
500|$|Their {{legs are}} long, the hind pair well adapted for jumping; a flea can jump {{vertically}} up to 7in (18cm) and horizontally up to 13in (33cm), making the flea {{one of the}} best jumpers of all known animals (relative to body size), second only to the froghopper. [...] The flea jump is so rapid and forceful that it exceeds the capabilities of muscle, and instead of relying on direct muscle power, fleas store muscle energy in <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> the elastic protein named resilin before releasing it rapidly (like a human using a bow and arrow). [...] Immediately before the jump, muscles contract and deform the resilin pad, slowly storing energy which can then be released extremely rapidly to power leg extension for propulsion. [...] To prevent premature release of energy or motions of the leg, the flea employs a [...] "catch mechanism". [...] Early in the jump, the tendon of the primary jumping muscle passes slightly behind the coxa-trochanter joint, generating a torque which holds the joint closed with the leg close to the body. [...] To trigger jumping, another muscle pulls the tendon forward until it passes the joint axis, generating the opposite torque to extend the leg and power the jump by release of stored energy. The actual take off has been shown by high-speed video to be from the tibiae and tarsi rather than from the trochantera (knees).|$|E

2500|$|The note demanded $118,000, {{the rounded}} amount of John Ramsey's bonus that year. Fitzgerald {{said that the}} note was not written by a {{kidnapper}} or a [...] "real criminal", but someone who had written the note on <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> paper used by Patsy Ramsey in their home. The note was unusually long, most ransom notes are 50 to 60 words. It took the experts 21 minutes or more to copy the ransom note and it noted {{that it would take}} more time to think about what to write. The pen and paper were not left out, but returned to their rightful place by the note's author. Many lines from the letter were taken from Speed, [...] Dirty Harry and other films.|$|E
2500|$|The camels' thick coats {{insulate}} {{them from}} the intense heat radiated from desert sand; a shorn camel must sweat 50% more to avoid overheating. During the summer the coat becomes lighter in color, reflecting light as well as helping avoid sunburn. The camel's long legs help by keeping its body farther from the ground, which can heat up to [...] The two humped camels classified as bigger than the dromedary camels and for this reason, the skin became significantly more helpful for usage as wool and leather (Yam & Khomeiri, 2015). Dromedaries have <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> thick tissue over the sternum called the pedestal. When the animal lies down in a sternal recumbent position, the pedestal raises the body from the hot surface and allows cooling air to pass under the body.|$|E
2500|$|Bolland now {{draws on}} a computer, eschewing pencil and paper. He cites the {{influence}} of Dave Gibbons, who [...] "had got into computers himself, and... was really enthusing about them." [...] Noting also that some colorists were increasingly using computer effects [...] "seemingly arbitrarily," [...] he decided [...] "that if I didn't {{take control of the}} colouring process myself... would eventually transform the covers into something not my own." [...] Starting in 1997, Bolland [...] "bought all the gear" [...] and spent ten frustrated months learning the ropes and ultimately finding the liberating [...] "infinite ability to change" [...] his now-solely-onscreen artwork. He states categorically that, in his opinion, [...] "here is absolutely no difference between drawing on my Wacom tablet and drawing on <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> paper." [...] Having fully embraced the technology, Bolland has also produced a number of [...] on his [...] demonstrating his complex techniques.
