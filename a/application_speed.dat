Most {{of the time}} development speed refers to the speed that a programmer can program with a particular programming language. It's a crucial factor of productivity of a programming language. <b>Application</b> <b>speed</b> is often compared with development speed when programming languages are discussed. For example, Python has a high development speed but a poor <b>application</b> <b>speed.</b> C has a low development speed but a good <b>application</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E

30|$|We {{observe that}} the use of {{software}} bypassing leads to improvements in <b>application</b> <b>speed,</b> with architectures having the smallest number of register file ports consistently outperforming architectures with larger number of ports, and reduction in energy consumption. In contrast, connectivity reduction maintains the same <b>application</b> <b>speed,</b> reduces energy consumption, and allows for increase in processor frequency; however, with the clock frequency increased to match the performance of software bypassing, energy consumption grows. We also observe that in case reprogrammability is not an issue, the most energy-efficient solution is a combination of software bypassing and connectivity reduction.|$|E

40|$|Memory latency is {{becoming}} an increasingly important performance bottleneck, especially in multiprocessors. One technique for tolerating memory latency is multithreading, whereby we switch between threads upon expensive cache misses. In contrast with previous work on multithreading, we explore a new approach that is software-controlled rather than hardware-controlled. To implement software-controlled multithreading, we use informing memory operations to quickly trap upon cache misses to a miss handler which performs the actual thread switching in software. Our experimental results demonstrate that software-controlled multithreading can result in signi cant performance gains on a shared-memory multiprocessor, {{with the majority of}} <b>applications</b> <b>speeding</b> up by 10 % or more, and one <b>application</b> <b>speeding</b> up by 16 %. In addition, we nd that by selectively applying a register partitioning optimization to reduce the thread-switching overhead, we can increase the overall speedups to as much as 25 %. Given the much simpler hardware support required by our scheme, and the fact that its software overheads are expected to become less and less expensive over time relative to memory latencies, software-controlled multithreading is attractive alternative to traditional hardware-based schemes...|$|R

40|$|ISBN: 0769500781 Summary form only given. Progress in {{technological}} scaling {{allows the}} integration {{into a single}} chip of {{hundreds of millions of}} transistors, moving quickly to the multi-billion transistor capacities. Achieving acceptable quality and reliability levels for these complex products {{is one of the most}} critical issues that need to be faced. Testability is therefore a key factor that could limit these trends if not addressed adequately. At these levels of complexity external testing is becoming infeasible due to ATPG limitations. At the same time, the scan approach is losing interest due to the increasing length of scan chains (and thus test length), and low test <b>application</b> <b>speed.</b> At-speed test is a major limitation at a context where increasing clock frequencies (moving quickly to the multi-GHz domain), are making timing faults predominant. Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) is another important limitation, since, although its very high cost, it does not offer the memory capacities/depth and test <b>application</b> <b>speed</b> required for testing present day ICs. Under these constraints, the only realistic issue is to extend the BIST practice beyond memory testing. This requires new developments on logic BIST for increasing fault coverage while containing hardware cost. Furthermore, new developments on fault modeling, fault simulation, and ATPG tools are needed to encounter for timing faults, cross talk, ground bounce and other spurious faults. These developments should be oriented towards a BIST approach...|$|E

For this <b>application,</b> <b>speed,</b> reliability, {{and the ability}} to produce a dense depth map are of foremost importance. This paper evaluates a number of matching techniques for possible use in a stereo vision sensor for mining automation applications. Area-based techniques have been investigated because they have the potential to yield dense maps, are amenable to fast hardware implementation, and are suited to textured scenes. In addition, two non-parametric transforms, namely, the rank and census, have been investigated. Matching algorithms using these transforms were found to have a number of clear advantages, including reliability in the presence of radiometric distortion, low computational complexity, and amenability to hardware implementation...|$|E

The process by applying riblet paint in a single step by application, embossing and partial curing by UV-light is an alternative to bonded riblet foils for large area applications. The main advantage of this technique is the ability to paint three-dimensional surfaces with a functional riblet surface without any additional process steps, thus ultimately saving costs.
