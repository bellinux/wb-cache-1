25|$|Although {{she knew}} her voice was good <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> the attention, {{becoming}} an actress was her main objective. That desire was made stronger when she saw her first Broadway play, The Diary of Anne Frank, when she was fourteen. The star in the play was Susan Strasberg, whose acting she wanted to emulate if ever given the chance. To help achieve that goal, Streisand began spending her spare time in the library, studying the biographies of various stage actresses such as Eleanora Duse and Sarah Bernhardt. In addition, she began reading novels and plays, including some by Shakespeare and Ibsen, and also on her own, studied the acting theories of Konstantin Stanislavski and Michael Chekhov.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé discussed how excited she was about the collaboration stating, [...] "I loved working with Alejandro on 'Amor Gitano.'

[...] Alejandro Fernández stated that as the production [...] and recording of his album was nearly over, {{he was told that}} Beyoncé wanted to record a duet with a Latino male for her next album. He stated: [...] "So when they suggested it, I liked the idea. I thought it was spectacular. So we went, I gave her the song <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> it [...] We recorded it in one day. She seemed like a fine lady to me, very humble, with a great voice." ...|$|E
500|$|Her {{performance}} in The Dreamers led Ridley Scott to cast Green in Kingdom of Heaven (2005), {{a film about}} the Crusades where she played Sibylla of Jerusalem. Green performed six screen tests and was hired only a week before principal photography began. Green found the atmosphere of coming onto a film so late tense and exciting, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> the film's ambiguity in approaching its subject matter. To her disappointment, much of her screen time was cut. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com praised her performance: [...] "She doesn't quite {{know what to do}} with her character's stilted dialogue, but she carries herself so regally that you barely notice." [...] Nev Pierce of the BBC, however, called her character [...] "limp". Green was satisfied when her character's complex subplot was restored in the director's cut. Total Film said the new scenes completed her performance: [...] "In the theatrical cut, Princess Sibylla sleeps with Balian and then, more or less, loses her mind. Now we understand why. Not only does Sibylla have a young son, but when she realizes he's afflicted with leprosy just like her brother Baldwin, she decides to take his life shortly after he's been crowned king." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Mi Chico Latino" [...] {{was written}} by Halliwell, Andy Watkins and Paul Wilson {{in the autumn of}} 1998. The singer wanted to make a song with Spanish influences, in order to pay homage for her Spanish mother. During a day in the studio, they came up with a melody but did not have any words. Then she called her mother for help. Halliwell {{recalled}} asking her, [...] "Mum, {{what do you say to}} a bloke in Spanish if you fancy him and are being romantic?" [...] Her mother then said she did not remember that. So she asked her look at her library of Spanish language romances, and she read the titles out to Halliwell. Eventually she came out with [...] "¿Dónde está el hombre con fuego en la sangre?" [...] ("Where is the man with fire in his blood?" [...] in English), <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> the way it sounded, and included the line at the beginning of the song. After [...] "Look at Me" [...] peaked only at number two, her record company wanted her to release [...] "Lift Me Up", while the Absolute team wanted [...] "Bag It Up", but she chose to release [...] "Mi Chico Latino" [...] after receiving good reception from children.

500|$|... "Rain" [...] is {{the tenth}} track whose lyrics talk about waiting and hoping for love. The song {{features}} a crescendo towards the end. The subsequent track, [...] "Why's It So Hard," [...] {{is considered the}} album's plea for solidarity with her audience, as Madonna sings: [...] "Why's {{it so hard to}} love one another?" [...] The following song, [...] "In This Life," [...] was written in memory of friends who Madonna had lost to the AIDS epidemic. The drums were compared to a doomsday clock and the keyboard intervals were also compared to George Gershwin's blues lullaby [...] "Prelude No. 2," [...] creating a sense of dis-ease. The thirteenth track, [...] "Did You Do It?" [...] features rappers Mark Goodman and Dave Murphy. The song was omitted in the clean edition of Erotica. [...] Producer André Betts claimed that for fun, he just rapped over the track [...] "Waiting," [...] while Madonna was gone, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> it after hearing later. The last track from the album, [...] "Secret Garden," [...] is described as Eroticas most personal song. In addition, [...] "Secret Garden" [...] is dedicated to the singer's vagina, [...] "the secret place where she could enjoy herself." [...] It features a jazz-house beat.|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea for}} the {{television}} show Family was born in Aaron Spelling's kitchen, where he and Leonard Goldberg {{came up with the}} idea about a show that centered on the emotional life of a family. They pitched the idea to Allen <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> it. Allen spent two weeks at the Beverly Hills Hotel while she knocked out a script. Len and Aaron loved it; it was touching and had marvelous moments of compassion, and was exactly what they had talked about in the kitchen. The pilot was great, but ABC didn't buy it. It wasn't until two years later that ABC entered a production deal with Mike Nichols, who turned down all their ideas in favor of the script for Family that his Connecticut neighbor Jay Allen had shown him. It was Nichols who brought in Mark Rydell for the pilot which premiered at 10:00pm on March 9, 1976; the series went on to run for four years and 86 episodes. Later in life Allen would remark about television: [...] "I hate it, I hate it because the buck doesn't stop anywhere." ...|$|E
