5|$|During this period, Miller {{achieved}} {{more success}} as a footballer, following his brothers in joining the Brighton Football Club in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1937.

40|$|In this paper, an {{approach}} for 3 D motion estimation of head <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> of persons in videophone sequences is presented. Since head <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> are linked {{together by the}} neck, constraints for the motion of head <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> exist which are exploited to improve the motion estimation. In this paper, the human neck joint is modelled by a spherical joint between head <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> its 3 D position is calculated. Then, rotation and translation of the <b>shoulders</b> are estimated <b>and</b> propagated to the head. Finally, a rotation of the head around the neck joint is estimated. The presented approach {{is applied to the}} videophone sequences Akiyo and Claire. Compared with {{an approach}} without using a neck joint, anatomically correct positions of head <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> are estimated. 1.

5|$|During his {{re-examination}} of Iguanodon, David Norman {{was able}} to show that this posture was unlikely, because the long tail was stiffened with ossified tendons. To get the tripodal pose, the tail would literally have to be broken. Putting the animal in a horizontal posture makes many aspects of the arms and pectoral girdle more understandable. For example, the hand is relatively immobile, with the three central fingers grouped together, bearing hoof-like phalanges, and able to hyperextend. This would have allowed them to bear weight. The wrist is also relatively immobile, and the arms <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> bones robust. These features all suggest that the animal spent time on all fours.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} tetrapods, the gastralia and ribs with uncinate processes, {{together}} with bony {{elements such as}} bony plates in the skin (osteoderms) and clavicles (collar bone), would have formed a sort of exoskeleton around the body, protecting the belly and helping to hold in the guts and inner organs. These anatomical details most likely evolved from structures involved in locomotion even before the vertebrates ventured onto land. The gastralia {{may have been involved}} in the breathing process in early amphibians and reptiles.
