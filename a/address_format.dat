Due to large number of population, the <b>address</b> <b>format</b> is changed to Phase, Package, Block and Lot.|$|E
50|$|An IPv6 address {{consists}} of 128 bits.

5000|$|The AMD64 {{architecture}} {{defines a}} 64-bit virtual <b>address</b> <b>format,</b> {{of which the}} low-order 48 bits are used in current implementations. This allows up to 256 TB (248 bytes) of virtual address space. The architecture definition allows this limit to be raised in future implementations to the full 64 bits, extending the virtual address space to 16 EB (264 bytes). This is compared to just 4 GB (232 bytes) for the x86.|$|E
50|$|Deployment of IPv6 is the standards-based {{solution}} to the IPv4 address shortage. IPv6 is endorsed and implemented by all Internet technical standards bodies and network equipment vendors. It encompasses many design improvements, including {{the replacement of the}} 32-bit IPv4 <b>address</b> <b>format</b> with a 128-bit address which provides an addressing space without limitations for the foreseeable future. IPv6 has been in active production deployment since June 2006, after organized worldwide testing and evaluation in the 6bone project ceased. Interoperability for hosts using only IPv4 protocols is implemented with a variety of IPv6 transition mechanisms.|$|E

50|$|Postcodes {{are used}} to sort letters to their {{destination}} either manually, where sorters use labelled frames, or increasingly with letter-coding systems, where machines assist in sorting.

5000|$|The {{choice between}} ty and vy {{is closely related}} to, yet {{sometimes}} different from, {{the choice of the}} <b>addressing</b> <b>format</b> - that is, the selection from the first name, patronymics, last name, and the title to be used when addressing the person. Normally, ty is associated with the informal addressing by first name only (or, even more informally, by the patronymic only), whereas vy is associated with the more formal <b>addressing</b> <b>format</b> of using the first name together with patronymics (roughly analogous to [...] "title followed by last name" [...] in English) or the last name together with a title (the last name is almost never used together with either of the other two names to address someone, although such combinations are routinely used to introduce or mention someone). However, nowadays, vy can also be employed while addressing by first name only.|$|R
