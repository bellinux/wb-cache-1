40|$|Introduction: The present {{work had}} the {{objective}} {{to show the}} development of indicators of institutionalization of mentally ill in historic time series. Further aim of the work {{was to determine the}} prevalence rates of substance use disorders and comorbid mental disorders in newly admitted women in the prison system. Treatment histories in psychiatry of prison inmates should yield further information on the interdependence of the psychiatric treatment system and penal justice system. Methods: Psychiatric bed numbers, prison populations, the occupation in the forensic system and number of people living in assisted housing facilities were collected in historical time series separately for the former East and West Germany since the political change of the year 1990. Ministries, public and private agencies were contacted on the federal and state level. Furthermore 150 newly admitted women were interviewed in the central receiving facility of the female prison system in Berlin using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and the Borderline module of the SCID-II. Percentages and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for the prevalence of mental disorders and substance use disorders. The frequency of former inpatient and outpatient treatment was assessed using structured questions. Results: In East Germany after the political change the general psychiatric beds were reduced by 61 %. The prison population rate went down by 77 %, so that it came to an <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>rates</b> between East and West Germany within a few years. In both parts of Germany capacities in the forensic system, in assisted housing and in rehabilitation facilities were built up. In West Germany the number of psychiatric beds decreased between 1989 and 2003 by 40 %. During the same period, the number of prison inmates grew by 33 %. After 2003 the number of psychiatric beds increased slightly, while the number of prisoners went down. The study of women in prison showed that 62 % had any substance use disorder. Most of these women (90 %) had at least one other mental disorder, 68 % had any lifetime mood disorder, 49 % had borderline or antisocial personality disorder, 44 % any anxiety disorder. The majority (66 %) of the prisoners had been in inpatient (53 %) and/or outpatient (41 %) psychiatric treatment before imprisonment. Conclusion: An approximation with regard to the nature and frequency of institutionalization took place between East and West Germany within a few years. Inverse trends of psychiatric bed numbers and prison population rates, especially for West Germany could speak for transinstitutionalization phenomena between the two institutions. Imprisoned women have high rates of mental disorders. In particular, women with substance use disorders often had comorbid mental disorders. A majority of the women committed to prison had been in psychiatric inpatient treatment, which supports the hypothesis of high interdependence between the two systems...|$|E

We demonstrate reduction in <b>alignment</b> error <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> approximately 30 % resulting from (1) giving extra weight to the probability <b>of</b> <b>alignment</b> to the null word, (2) smoothing probability estimates for rare words, and (3) using a simple heuristic estimation method to initialize, or replace, EM training of model parameters. ...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1 970 s, {{floating}} exchange {{rates have been}} associated with international cycles of inflation and deflation with the United States as the epicenter. Random and essentially arbitrary exchange fluctuations have continually misaligned national price levels—culminating in extreme dollar overvaluation throughout most of the 1980 s. In order to seal off domestic markets from these precipitate changes in foreign competitive pressure, a worldwide upsurge in protectionism has occurred—particularly in the United States. But the international business cycle can be tamed with a better <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> exchange <b>rates</b> if the principal industrial countries agree to coordinate their monetary policies. A set of rules is suggested for having the United States, Germany (representing the European bloc), and Japan symmetrically adjust their internal money growth rates so as to keep their exchange rates within officially announced target zones. The common price level would be stabilized through smoother growth in their joint money supply...|$|R

In this paper, we propose a novel optimization strategy to ease spareness by multi-granularity word alignment and translation for agglutinative language. Multiple alignment results are combined to catch the complementary information for <b>alignments,</b> and rules <b>of</b> different granularities can cooperate effectively to translate more unknown words. Experimental results on Uyghur-Chinese show that our proposed method significantly improves the quality <b>of</b> word <b>alignment</b> and translation, by relative 10. 25 % <b>of</b> <b>alignment</b> error <b>rate</b> reduction and + 2. 46 % BLEU increment, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Bayesian {{analysis}} of functions and curves is considered, where warping and other geometrical transformations are often required for meaningful comparisons. The functions and curves of interest are represented using the recently introduced square root velocity function, which enables a warping invariant elastic distance {{to be calculated}} in a straightforward manner. We distinguish between various spaces of interest: the original space, the ambient space after standardizing, and the quotient space after removing a group of transformations. Using Gaussian process models in the ambient space and Dirichlet priors for the warping functions, we explore Bayesian inference for curves and functions. Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are introduced for simulating from the posterior. We also compare ambient and quotient space estimators for mean shape, and explain their frequent similarity in many practical problems using a Laplace approximation. Simulation studies are carried out, as well as practical <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> growth <b>rate</b> functions and shape classification of mouse vertebra outlines in evolutionary biology. We also compare the performance of our Bayesian method with some alternative approaches...|$|R
40|$|Word {{alignment}} aims to link {{each word}} of a translated sentence to its related words in the source sentence. Nowadays, Giza++ is the most used word alignment system. This toolkit implements the generative IBM models. Despite its popularity, several limitations remain. We thus propose to address this task using discriminative models (Maximum Entropy and Conditional Random Fields) which can easily make use of additional features. These models are evaluated in terms <b>of</b> <b>Alignment</b> Error <b>Rate</b> (AER) using two language pairs (French/english and Arabic English). Our results show that discriminant models are well suited for this task {{and that they can}} outperform IBM models...|$|R

An extensive parametric analysis has been performed {{for a range of}} values of droplet equivalence ratio (ϕd), droplet diameter (ad) and turbulence intensity (u′). The results have been analysed to analyse the statistical behaviours <b>of</b> the <b>alignments</b> <b>of</b> the gradients of mixture fraction and reaction progress variable and of the vorticity vector (ω→) with the local principal strain <b>rates.</b> The resulting <b>alignments</b> <b>of</b> reactive scalar gradient and vorticity with local principal strain rates in droplet-laden flames have been compared to those observed for a gaseous stoichiometric premixed flame under the same turbulent flow conditions. The differences in behaviour have been identified in terms of the statistical behaviours of scalar gradient and vorticity alignments with local principal strain <b>rates</b> in terms <b>of</b> the eight local flow topologies, classified as either focal (four topologies) or nodal (four topologies), in four zones across the flame: leading edge, preheat zone, burning reactants and trailing edge. This information has in turn been utilised to offer detailed physical explanations for the observed differences in <b>alignment</b> statistics <b>of</b> reactive scalar gradient and vorticity between turbulent premixed and spray flames. The implications of scalar gradient and vorticity alignment on the statistical behaviours of scalar–turbulence interaction and vortex stretching terms have been discussed in detail along with explanations for their dependences on droplet size, droplet equivalence ratio and turbulence intensity...|$|R
40|$|The lack of readily-available large corpora of aligned {{monolingual}} sentence pairs is a {{major obstacle}} {{to the development of}} Statistical Machine Translation-based paraphrase models. In this paper, we describe the use of annotated datasets and Support Vector Machines to induce larger monolingual paraphrase corpora from a comparable corpus of news clusters found on the World Wide Web. Features include: morphological variants; WordNet synonyms and hypernyms; loglikelihood-based word pairings dynamically obtained from baseline sentence alignments; and formal string features such as word-based edit distance.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{generation}} of terahertz radiation from atoms and molecules driven by an ultrashort fundamental laser and its second harmonic field by solving time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE). The comparisons between one-, two-, and three- dimensional TDSE numerical simulations show that initial ionized wave-packet and its subsequent acceleration in the laser field and rescattering with long-range Coulomb potential play key roles. We also present the dependence of the optimum phase delay and yield of terahertz radiation on the laser intensity, wavelength, duration, and the ratio of two-color laser components. Terahertz wave generation from model hydrogen molecules are further investigated by comparing with high harmonic emission. It is found that the terahertz yield is following the <b>alignment</b> dependence <b>of</b> ionization <b>rate,</b> while the optimal two-color phase delays varies by a small amount when the alignment angle changes from 0 to 90 degrees, which reflects <b>alignment</b> dependence <b>of</b> attosecond electron dynamics. Finally we show that terahertz emission {{might be used to}} clarify the origin of interference in high harmonic generation from aligned molecules by coincidently measuring the angle-resolved THz yields...|$|R
40|$|This study aims at {{assessing}} the pertinence of a {{fixed exchange rate}} between the CFA franc and the euro during the present European crisis. The paper shows negative impact of the European crisis on the real exchange rate (RER) and the misalignment of the CFA franc, and negative effects on the macroeconomic equilibrium of the zone. In fact, an aligned exchange rate is supposed to promote the twin goals of internal and external target of equilibrium. The results from simulation of reduced equations, derived from the Dependent economy model {{are consistent with those}} already highlighted in the literature. Indeed, the outbreak of the Eurozone crisis tends to usher the RER appreciation and thus, uphold the misalignment of the CFA franc. This has a significant rippling effect on the GDP growth and trade balance. One can therefore assume that the exchange <b>rate</b> policy <b>of</b> the CFA zone should be guided towards a fluctuating exchange rate within a precised threshold as a “honeymoon effect” to curb vulnerability of external effects and promote the <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> the exchange <b>rate</b> which is essential to the macroeconomic stability...|$|R

40|$|Word {{alignment}} models form {{an important}} part of building statistical machine translation systems. Semi-supervised word alignment aims to improve the accuracy <b>of</b> automatic word <b>alignment</b> by incorporating full or partial alignments acquired from humans. Such dedicated elicitation effort is often expensive and depends on availability of bilingual speakers for the language-pair. In this paper we study active learning query strategies to carefully identify highly uncertain or most informative alignment links that are proposed under an unsupervised word alignment model. Manual correction of such informative links can then be applied to create a labeled dataset used by a semi-supervised word alignment model. Our experiments show that using active learning leads to maximal reduction <b>of</b> <b>alignment</b> error <b>rates</b> with reduced human effort. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{empirical}} {{adequacy of}} synchronous context-free grammars of rank two (2 -SCFGs) (Satta and Peserico, 2005), used in syntax-based machine translation {{systems such as}} Wu (1997), Zhang et al.

Other alignment configurations that cannot be induced by 2 -SCFGs are identified in this pa-per, and their frequencies across a wide col-lection of hand-aligned parallel corpora are examined. Empirical lower bounds on two measures <b>of</b> <b>alignment</b> error <b>rate,</b> i. e. the one introduced in Och and Ney (2000) and one where only complete translation units are con-sidered, are derived for 2 -SCFGs and related formalisms. ...|$|R

In this paper, we propose a framework in which information about the multi-word expressions can be used in the word-alignment task. We have shown that even simple features like point-wise mutual information are useful for word-alignment task in English-Hindi parallel corpora. The alignment error rate which we achieve (AER = 0. 5040) is significantly better (about 10 % decrease in AER) than the <b>alignment</b> error <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> the state-of-art models (Och and Ney, 2003) (Best AER = 0. 5518) on the English-Hindi dataset. ...|$|R
