5000|$|Summative {{assessment}} - Summative <b>assessment</b> <b>is</b> generally {{carried out}} at the end of a course or project. In an educational setting, summative <b>assessments</b> <b>are</b> typically used to assign students a course grade. Summative <b>assessments</b> <b>are</b> evaluative. Summative <b>assessments</b> <b>are</b> made to summarize what the students have learned, to determine whether they understand the subject matter well. This type of <b>assessment</b> <b>is</b> typically graded (e.g. pass/fail, 0-100) and can take the form of tests, exams or projects. Summative <b>assessments</b> <b>are</b> often used to determine whether a student has passed or failed a class. A criticism of summative <b>assessments</b> <b>is</b> that they are reductive, and learners discover how well they have acquired knowledge too late for it to be of use.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} events {{had taken place in}} and around Jena in the months before the Barker assault, which the media have {{associated}} with an alleged escalation of local racial tensions. These events included the hanging of rope nooses from a tree in the high school courtyard, two violent confrontations between white and black youths, and the destruction by fire of the main building of Jena High School. Extensive news coverage related to the Jena Six often reported these events as linked. Federal and parish attorneys concluded from their investigations that <b>assessment</b> <b>was</b> inaccurate for some of the events; for instance, the burning of the high school was an attempt to destroy grade records.|$|E

Their hoax is almost revealed at a neighborhood barbecue when a fork stabs her pregnancy stomach pads. Orson suggests coming clean to avoid the humiliation if their lies were to be discovered, but Bree tells him that this child is her second chance at successfully raising a child. Meanwhile, Susan worries that Mike is dissatisfied with their marriage, especially after Adam, her new gynecologist, reveals that she may be entering menopause.

5|$|In 1855, Tchaikovsky's father funded {{private lessons}} with Rudolph Kündinger and {{questioned}} {{him about a}} musical career for his son. While impressed with the boy's talent, Kündinger said he saw nothing to suggest a future composer or performer. He later admitted that his <b>assessment</b> <b>was</b> also based on his own negative experiences as a musician in Russia and his unwillingness for Tchaikovsky to be treated likewise. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.|$|E

5|$|In March 2011 an {{assessment}} of the Greyfriars site began to identify where the monastery had stood, and which land might be available for excavation. A desk-based <b>assessment</b> <b>was</b> conducted to determine the archaeological viability of the site, followed by a survey in August 2011 using ground-penetrating radar (GPR). The GPR results were inconclusive; no clear building remains could be identified owing to a layer of disturbed ground and demolition debris just below the surface. The survey was useful in finding modern utilities crossing the site, such as pipes and cables.|$|E

The Israeli media declared that {{a solution to}} the SAM problem was found, but the IAF Commander, David Ivry, said that this <b>assessment</b> <b>was</b> premature, and that the SA-9 was not really significantly superior to its predecessors. The Prime Minister, Menachem Begin, then also Minister of Defense, announced that the IAF could destroy the SAM batteries in two hours. Ivry told the media that the IAF could do nothing of the kind.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The current {{technical}} {{history of}} nonbiased <b>assessment</b> <b>is</b> highlighted. Definitions {{of fairness and}} experts' attempts to alleviate problems associated with bios in <b>assessment</b> <b>are</b> reviewed. Factors relating to nonbiased <b>assessment</b> <b>are</b> emphasized that normally do not receive sufficient attention. Decisions currently made {{as a result of}} the <b>assessment</b> process <b>are</b> reviewed and an examination made of how decisions based on inappropriate evaluation can negate the validity of the assessment process. Finally, the utility of many recent efforts to resolve the problems of bias in <b>assessment</b> <b>is</b> questioned and it is suggested that very basic systematic changes are needed before real progress can be mode in reducing bias in assessment...|$|R

5|$|Taxes were levied on {{mining and}} forest products, and {{additional}} income was raised through tolls {{for the use}} of transportation facilities. The state also collected fees from customs, professional licenses, and judicial fines. Records show horses and salt were taxed as well as commodities (gold, textiles, perfumes) and agricultural produce (black pepper, paddy, spices, betel leaves, palm leaves, coconuts and sugar). Land tax <b>assessment</b> <b>was</b> based on frequent surveys evaluating the quality of land and the type of produce. Chalukya records specifically mention black soil and red soil lands in addition to wetland, dry land and wasteland in determining taxation rates.|$|E
5|$|The 1224 carucage was a tax levied {{only on the}} clergy, and the {{revenues}} from it did not appear in that year's Pipe Roll.

The 1224 <b>assessment</b> <b>was</b> based on ploughteams, and was imposed to pay for the restitution of the lost lands in France.|$|E
5|$|The Environmental Assessment Scoping Report for the {{proposed}} station was submitted to the Department of Trade and Industry in 2007, and the application for the development was {{to be made to}} the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform once the Environmental Impact <b>Assessment</b> <b>was</b> completed. A contract had already been signed with the Shaw Group to design and engineer the station. If Npower had been granted permission to build the new station, construction work would have begun in 2010, and the station was expected to be fully commissioned by 2014.

5|$|This <b>assessment</b> <b>was</b> left {{unchanged}} for decades, as {{few players}} {{at the highest}} level used the Budapest Gambit and information about games from lesser players could not easily be found. During that time, various responses were developed against the 4.Bf4 line; these included 4...g5, invented by István Abonyi, further developed by the masters Bakonyi and Drimer. The master Kaposztas showed that even when White succeeded in his positional plan, it only meant for Black a worse endgame with drawish tendencies. Two pawn sacrifices were also introduced in the variation with 6.Nbd2 (still in the 4.Bf4 line), based on pawn pushes d7–d6 or f7–f6 and a quick attack against b2.|$|E
5|$|Under the Commonwealth, {{the country}} was {{relatively}} highly taxed, but gained access to English markets. Under Charles I Scotland had paid about £17,000 sterling a year in taxes. In 1656 the civil list alone cost £25,000. The sum of £10,000 a month from the county <b>assessment</b> <b>was</b> demanded by the Cromwellian regime, which Scotland failed to fully supply and it was reduced to 6,000 a year in 1657. The total was never less than £90,000 a year. In addition the country contributed about £35,000 in excise a year. Despite this, there was an annual deficit of £130,000, which was covered by English revenues.|$|E
5|$|At Christmas 1085, William {{ordered the}} {{compilation}} {{of a survey}} of the landholdings held by himself and by his vassals throughout the kingdom, organised by counties. It resulted in a work now known as the Domesday Book. The listing for each county gives the holdings of each landholder, grouped by owners. The listings describe the holding, who owned the land before the Conquest, its value, what the tax <b>assessment</b> <b>was,</b> and usually the number of peasants, ploughs, and any other resources the holding had. Towns were listed separately. All the English counties south of the River Tees and River Ribble are included, and the whole work seems to have been mostly completed by 1 August 1086, when the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that William received the results and that all the chief magnates swore the Salisbury Oath, a renewal of their oaths of allegiance. William's exact motivation in ordering the survey is unclear, but it probably had several purposes, such as making a record of feudal obligations and justifying increased taxation.|$|E
30|$|The {{concept of}} <b>assessment</b> <b>is</b> also {{recognized}} in the pre-school core curriculum (Ojala, 2005).

5|$|For {{the early}} part of the era, the {{authority}} of the crown was limited by the large number of minorities it had seen since the early fifteenth century. This tended to decrease the level of royal revenues, as regents often alienated land and revenues. Regular taxation was adopted from 1581 and afterwards was called on with increasing frequency and scale until in 1612 a demand of £240,000 resulted in serious opposition. A new tax on annual rents amounting to five per cent on all interest on loans, mainly directed at the merchants of the burghs, was introduced in 1621; but it was widely resented and was still being collected over a decade later. Under Charles I the annual income from all sources in Scotland was under £16,000 sterling and inadequate for the normal costs of government, with the court in London now being financed out of English revenues. The sum of £10,000 a month from the county <b>assessment</b> <b>was</b> demanded by the Cromwellian regime, which Scotland failed to fully supply, but it did contribute £35,000 in excise a year. Although Parliament made a formal grant of £40,000 a year to Charles II, the rising costs civilian government and war meant that this was inadequate to support Scottish government. Under William I and after the Union, engagement in continental and colonial wars led to heavier existing taxes and new taxes, including the Poll and Hearth Taxes.|$|E
5|$|On {{the advice}} of Rommel and Jodl, Hitler decided that the Italian Peninsula could not be held without the {{assistance}} of the Italian Army. Kesselring was ordered to withdraw from southern Italy and consolidate his Army Group C with Rommel's Army Group B in Northern Italy, where Rommel would assume overall command. Kesselring was slated to be posted to Norway. Kesselring was appalled at the prospect of abandoning Italy. It would expose southern Germany to bombers operating from Italy; risk the Allies breaking into the Po Valley; and was completely unnecessary, as he was certain that Rome could be held until the summer of 1944. This <b>assessment</b> <b>was</b> based on his belief that the Allies would not conduct operations outside the range of their air cover, which could only reach as far as Salerno. Kesselring submitted his resignation on 14 August 1943.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} day the crew trapped in the gunroom created a small {{explosion}} just outside it, using gunpowder, in which Gulik was injured again. Their hope was to frighten the Malagasy into submission, and a female Malagasy who had been held in the gunroom was instructed to tell the other Malagasy that, {{if they did not}} surrender, the crew would blow up the ship. The Malagasy responded by saying that they had seen the fearful effect that the explosion also had on the crew, and refused to surrender, again demanding that they be returned to Madagascar. Olof Leij agreed, but Captain Muller ordered the crew to sail the ship towards Cape Agulhas, the southernmost point of Africa. Muller's <b>assessment</b> <b>was</b> that the Malagasy had little skill in seafaring and navigation and therefore would be unlikely to notice the deception, which proved to be the case. After three or four days' sailing they sighted land, the VOC settlement of Struisbaai.|$|E
