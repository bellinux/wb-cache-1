50|$|Drane Field, was {{essentially}} abandoned {{for the next}} decade. With the closure of Lodwick Aircraft at Lodwick Field in the mid-1950s, the city had decided to close it as a municipal airport {{in the summer of}} 1957 and concentrate its resources on Drane Field in south Lakeland. After several years of new construction and conversion to a civil airport, it was rededicated as Lakeland Municipal Airport in 1960. Today, the facility is known as Lakeland Linder Regional Airport with two of the original three runways still in service, one having been lengthened to 8500 feet. A new <b>airport</b> passenger <b>terminal</b> <b>complex</b> was constructed in the early 2000s and is home to several plaques, monuments and other memorabilia commemorating the airfield's World War II history as a U.S. Army Air Forces installation.|$|R

The first passenger terminal was built at the north-east side of the airfield, which lies in the suburb of Meenambakkam due to which it {{was referred to as}} Meenambakkam <b>Airport.</b> A new <b>terminal</b> <b>complex</b> was subsequently built at Tirusulam, further south near Pallavaram to which, passenger operations were shifted. The new domestic terminal was commissioned in 1985 and the international terminal was commissioned in 1989. The old terminal building is now used as a cargo terminal and is the base for the Indian courier company Blue Dart. On 23 September 1999, a centre for flowers, fruits and vegetables was commissioned at the cargo terminal. The new international departure terminal was commissioned in 2003.|$|R

40|$|Airport {{stakeholders}} {{and policy}} makers involved in airport strategic planning, design, and operations {{have a vested interest}} in assessing how their decisions on alternative terminal layout concepts and operational policies affect overall <b>airport</b> <b>terminal</b> system performance. A considerable amount of research has been devoted to modeling <b>airport</b> <b>terminal</b> operations and performance evaluation. However, no aggregate model provides the capability of supporting strategic decision making while addressing the modeling requirements of a generic model that can capture the complexity of <b>airport</b> <b>terminal</b> processes and a flexible model that can be easily customized to reflect the configuration and operational characteristics of any <b>airport</b> <b>terminal.</b> The objective of this research was threefold: (a) to demonstrate the need for adopting a new approach for <b>airport</b> <b>terminal</b> modeling and performance analysis; (b) to present the overall methodological framework followed for the development of the proposed model, with discussion of the conceptual framework adopted, the <b>airport</b> <b>terminal</b> domain ontology developed, and the model architecture and design; and (c) to demonstrate the model capabilities through modeling and analyzing the Athens, Greece, International <b>Airport</b> <b>terminal</b> case under two alternative traffic demand scenarios...|$|R
