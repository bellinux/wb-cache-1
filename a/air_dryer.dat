2500|$|This is {{the most}} common type of ozone {{generator}} for most industrial and personal uses. While variations of the [...] "hot spark" [...] coronal discharge method of ozone production exist, including medical grade and industrial grade ozone generators, these units usually work by means of a corona discharge tube. They are typically cost-effective and do not require an oxygen source other than the ambient air to produce ozone concentrations of 3–6%. Fluctuations in ambient air, due to weather or other environmental conditions, cause variability in ozone production. However, they also produce nitrogen oxides as a by-product. Use of an <b>air</b> <b>dryer</b> can reduce or eliminate nitric acid formation by removing water vapor and increase ozone production. Use of an oxygen concentrator can further increase the ozone production and further reduce the risk of nitric acid formation by removing not only the water vapor, but also the bulk of the nitrogen.|$|E
2500|$|UV ozone {{generators}} use ambient air for ozone production, no air prep systems are used (<b>air</b> <b>dryer</b> or oxygen concentrator), therefore these generators {{tend to be}} less expensive. [...] However UV {{ozone generators}} usually produce ozone with a concentration of about 0.5% or lower which limits the potential ozone production rate. Another disadvantage of this method is that it requires the ambient air (oxygen) to be exposed to the UV source for a longer amount of time, and any gas that is not exposed to the UV source will not be treated. This makes UV generators impractical for use in situations that deal with rapidly moving air or water streams (in-duct air sterilization, for example). Production of ozone is one of the potential dangers of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. VUV ozone generators are used in swimming pool and spa applications ranging to millions of gallons of water. VUV ozone generators, unlike corona discharge generators, do not produce harmful nitrogen by-products and also unlike corona discharge systems, VUV ozone generators work extremely well in humid air environments. There is also not normally a need for expensive off-gas mechanisms, and no need for air driers or oxygen concentrators which require extra costs and maintenance.|$|E

40|$|AbstractComparison of drying {{characteristics}} of Thompson seedless grapes using combined microwave oven and hot <b>air</b> cabinet <b>dryer</b> was investigated. The drying rate curves indicated {{the absence of}} a constant-rate drying period in all drying methods. Within a certain microwave power range (75 – 900 W in the current study), increasing microwave power speeds up the drying process, thus shortening the drying time. No benefits were seen when increasing drying time from 30 to 120 min when grapes drying started in hot <b>air</b> cabinet <b>dryer</b> and finished in microwave oven for 1 min at any power level. The higher value of energy consumption during grapes drying belonged to hot <b>air</b> cabinet <b>dryer</b> alone as drying method with value of 564. 5 MJ/kgwater evaporated.

50|$|Typically, the {{compressed}} air is first filtered with a high-quality coalescing filter. This filter removes liquid water, oil and particulate from {{the compressed}} air.

The moisture-laden sweep gas is then vented to the atmosphere, and clean, dry air is supplied to the application. The membrane <b>air</b> <b>dryers</b> are designed to operate continuously, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.

The search was limited to articles published in English from January 1970 through March 2011. Twelve studies were included in the review. Hand-drying effectiveness includes the speed of drying, degree of dryness, effective removal of bacteria, and prevention of cross-contamination.

50|$|Industrial food {{dehydration}} {{is often}} accomplished by freeze-drying.

50|$|Refrigeration dryers employ two heat {{exchanger}}s, one for air-to-air {{and one for}} air-to-refrigeration.

The compressors used in this type of dryer are usually of the hermetic type and the most common gas used is R-134a and R-410a for smaller <b>air</b> <b>dryers</b> up to 100 cfm. Older and larger dryers still use R-22 and R-404a refrigerants.

50|$|In-storage drying methods {{refers to}} those grain is dried {{and stored in}} the same container. Low-temperature drying, also known as near-ambient drying, is one of in-storage drying methods. There are four major factors which {{influence}} low temperature drying: the variability of weather, the harvest moisture content, the air flow in the storage bin {{and the amount of}} heated air. Most low-temperature dryers are built to dry grain as slowly as possible, while in the same time less spoilage on the grain. It is suggested that low temperature drying system is better operated when the average daily temperature is between 30 °C and 50 °C. Rather than control the drying air temperature, the low-temperature drying focuses on the relative humidity in order to achieve equilibrium moisture content (EMC) in all grain layers. Low-temperature drying process usually takes 5 days to several months depends on several important variables: weather, airflow, initial moisture content and amount of heat used. Among which, airflow is the key factor. Without appropriate airflow rate, spoilage will occur before drying is completed. By using heated air (LP heat, electric heat and solar heat), the relative humidity of the drying air is better controlled to achieve the desired moisture content. Usually, heated <b>air</b> <b>dryer</b> is used when the relative humidity larger than 70%. In electric heat dryers, an electrical resistant heater is usually placed before the fan to heat the airstream. In some case, a humidistat is employed to control the heater. In solar heat dryers, the drying air passes through the solar collector first to be heated (usually 10 to 12 °F rise), then enters the bin through the fan and motor. The advantages of in-storage low temperature drying are quick filling, high quality product, less equipment requirement; while the disadvantages are long drying time, electrical demand if using electric heat, high management skills and uncertain harvest moisture content.|$|E
