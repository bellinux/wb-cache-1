The overhaul included the replacement of her turbo-electric drive with more conventional geared turbines, which were made by Curtis. In addition, New Mexico received eight 5-inch/25 caliber anti-aircraft guns, replacing the four 3-inch/50 caliber guns that had been previously installed.

5|$|Although the {{parasite}} responsible for P.falciparum malaria {{has been in}} existence for 50,000–100,000 years, the population size of {{the parasite}} did not increase until about 10,000 years ago, concurrently with advances in agriculture <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of human settlements.

5|$|Chinese society {{during the}} Song dynasty (960–1279) {{was marked by}} {{political}} and legal reforms, a philosophical revival of Confucianism, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of cities beyond administrative purposes into centers of trade, industry, and maritime commerce. The inhabitants of rural areas were mostly farmers, although some were also hunters, fishers, or government employees working in mines or the salt marshes. Conversely, shopkeepers, artisans, city guards, entertainers, laborers, and wealthy merchants lived in the county and provincial centers along with the Chinese gentry—a small, elite community of educated scholars and scholar-officials.|$|E
5|$|Deborah Jean Lodge and colleagues, in a {{reorganization}} of the family Hygrophoraceae based on molecular phylogenetics, proposed that H.appalachianensis should be the type species of the new section Pseudofirmae in genus Hygrocybe. Species in this section, which include Hygrocybe chloochlora, H.rosea, and H.trinitensis, have sticky or glutinous caps that often have perforations in the center.

5|$|Developmental effects {{occur at}} very low doses in animals. They include frank {{teratogenicity}} such as cleft palate and hydronephrosis.

The latter is important in that tooth deformities were also seen after the Seveso accident and possibly after a long breast-feeding of babies in the 1970s and 1980s when the dioxin concentrations in Europe were about ten times higher than at present.|$|E

5|$|Except for chemicals, {{all of the}} old {{industries}} have disappeared {{and there has been}} diversification, in particular because of the close links to the motorway system <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of warehousing and distribution centres. A new town was built to the east of the existing town in the 1960s and 1970s, and areas of private housing have been established farther to the east; this has resulted in the population more than doubling from around 26,000 to its present level of 70,000.|$|E
