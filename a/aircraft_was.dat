5|$|A {{friend of}} Huseby helped {{the police in}} the negotiations. At 18:30, the <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> out of beer, so Huseby made an {{agreement}} that he would throw the gun {{out of the window}} in exchange for more beer. This was delivered by a civilian police officer. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> then immediately stormed by special forces and Huseby arrested. No-one was injured in the hijacking.|$|E
5|$|In August 1949, the <b>{{aircraft}}</b> <b>was</b> sold to Advance Industries, its engines being reinstalled {{to return}} the aircraft to powered status in DC-3C configuration. Some sources, however, indicate that the XCG-17 was reconverted to C-47 configuration in 1946. Following its restoration to powered status, the <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> transferred to Mexico, where it remained in civilian service until 1980.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Aircraft</b> <b>are</b> a {{prominent}} feature of CDF, {{especially during the}} summer fire season. Both fixed- and rotary-wing <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> employed. Helicopters, or rotary-wing <b>aircraft,</b> <b>are</b> used to transport firefighting [...] "Helitack Crews" [...] into fire areas. They also drop water and retardant chemicals on fires. Fixed-wing <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> used for command, observation, and to drop retardant chemicals on fires.|$|R
5|$|On 6 July 1944, Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress 43-37527 N7-X The Prowler of the 603d Bombardment Squadron, USAAF made an {{emergency}} wheels-up landing at RAF Penshurst. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> returning to RAF Nuthampstead from {{a raid on}} Saint-Omer, France. Eight of the eleven crew bailed out before the aircraft landed. Although a Leigh resident recalled that the <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> later repaired and flown out at a light load and taking advantage of favourable winds, official records show that the <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> written off. In December 1944, personnel based at Penshurst numbered 26 officers and 166 other ranks. On 2 February 1945, No. 664 Squadron RAF was deployed to Penshurst. They also flew Austers. On 23 March 1945, 664 Squadron were transferred to the Netherlands. On 10 July 1945 Douglas C-47A Dakota 42-108872 of the 23d Fighter Squadron USAAF crashed on landing at RAF Penshurst. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> written off. RAF Penshurst closed on 13 May 1946. The control tower was demolished in the 1970s. The crewroom was demolished in 1990. A hangar survived until 1991, when it blew down in a storm.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Government {{ordered a}} further two C-17s during 2011 and 2012. In February 2011 Minister for Defence Stephen Smith {{announced}} that another C-17 would be purchased for {{a cost of}} $A130 million. This <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> ordered to prevent a shortfall of airlift capacity while the original four C-17s underwent scheduled heavy maintenance. The decision to purchase this aircraft also supplanted an earlier plan to acquire two more C-130Js. As the deadline for A41-206 to be temporarily taken out of service for maintenance was rapidly approaching, the USAF agreed to transfer a C-17 airframe that was nearing completion to the RAAF. This <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> delivered on 14 September 2011 and arrived in Australia nine days later. At the ceremony held to welcome A41-210, Smith announced that the government intended to order another C-17. The $A160 million contract for this <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> signed in March 2012, and it was delivered to the RAAF on 1 November that year. Funding for these two <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> obtained {{through a combination of}} supplements to the Defence budget and reallocating unspent funds from ADF projects running behind schedule.|$|E
5|$|The Avianca Flight 52 <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> a Boeing 707-321B (registration number HK-2016). The <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> {{manufactured}} in June 1967 and {{was purchased by}} Avianca from Pan Am in 1977. By {{the time of the}} crash, the <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> 22 years old and had over 61,000 flight hours. The 707 was equipped with four JT3D-3B engines modified with a hush kit to reduce noise pollution. Avianca personnel reported that they factored in a five-percent fuel overburn into the performance calculations due to the hush kit along with an additional five-percent overburn due to the age of the aircraft. Additionally, maintenance crews had noted recurring issues with the aircraft's autopilot, including the altitude hold function.|$|E

The aircraft had a seating capacity of 156 or 149.|$|E
5|$|A fighter base {{to provide}} repair and {{overhaul}} facilities for carrier <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> {{constructed by the}} 78th Naval Construction Battalion on Ponam Island. As half of the work area was swamp, coral was blasted and dredged from the ocean bed and used as landfill. Another facility for carrier <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> built on Pityilu by the 71st Naval Construction Battalion in May and June 1944, along with accommodation for 2,500 men. The eastern end of Pityilu was cleared and a fleet recreation centre was built that could accommodate up to 10,000 at a time.|$|E

5|$|A weather system {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September3. The {{disturbance}} was small and became unidentifiable within 24hours of formation. Satellite imagery indicated that the disturbance may have acquired a circulation on September7, but the circulation was gone by the next day. The remaining tropical wave moved into the Lesser Antilles on September11 and a reconnaissance <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> deployed. The aircraft found circulation; however, by the next day, only a strong wave was detected. Atmospheric conditions became more favorable for development, yielding lower wind shear near Hispaniola for several days. The system moved into this area as the latest Reconnaissance <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> deployed, declaring it a tropical depression on September13 near the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} German {{aircraft}} designs {{that participated in}} the Condor Legion, {{and as part of}} other German involvement in the Spanish Civil War, a single Ju 87 A-0 (the V4 prototype) was allocated serial number 29-1 and was assigned to the VJ/88, the experimental Staffel of the Legion's fighter wing. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> secretly loaded onto the ship Usaramo and departed Hamburg harbor on the night of 1 August 1936, arriving in CÃ¡diz five days later. The only known information pertaining to its combat career in Spain is that it was piloted by Unteroffizier Herman Beuer, and took part in the Nationalist offensive against Bilbao in 1937. Presumably the <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> then secretly returned to Germany.|$|E

500|$|It is also {{suggested}} that the Black Spot <b>aircraft</b> <b>were</b> never intended {{to be used in}} combat. [...] However, as of 1966 20 production <b>aircraft</b> <b>were</b> planned, for a total cost of $64.7million. [...] There was even a recommendation that the C-130 Hercules be added to the program and used instead. [...] These projected <b>aircraft</b> <b>were</b> referred to as a Black Spot II. [...] After the Operation Trial and Evaluation, {{it was found that the}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>were</b> not suitably protected and survivable for protracted use in combat zones.
