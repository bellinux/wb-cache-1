40|$|Objective. To examine {{physical}} activity and achievement of {{physical activity}} goals in relation to self-reported pain {{and quality of life}} among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods. At baseline, 271 patients with RA were asked to specify a physical <b>activity</b> <b>goal,</b> and filled in questionnaires assessing physical activity, motivation, and self-efficacy for physical activity, arthritis pain, and quality of life. Six months later, patients indicated to what extent they had achieved their baseline physical <b>activity</b> <b>goal</b> and completed the same set of questionnaires. These data were used to construct multiple mediation models that placed {{physical activity and}} physical <b>activity</b> <b>goal</b> achievement as mediators between self-efficacy and motivation on one hand, and arthritis pain and quality of life on the other. Results. A total of 106 patients with RA completed both questionnaires. Self-efficacy at baseline predicted subsequent level of physical activity and achievement of physical activity goals. Goal achievement had a direct effect upon quality of life outcomes. Bootstrapping confidence intervals revealed indirect effects of self-efficacy upon arthritis pain and quality of life through goal achievement, but not through physical activity. Conclusion. Higher levels of self-efficacy for physical activity increase the likelihood that patients will achieve their physical activity goals. Achievement of physical activity goals seems to be related to lower self-reported arthritis pain, and higher levels of quality of life. In practice, clinicians can foster self-efficacy and goal achievement by assisting patients in setting realistic and attainable exercise goals, developing action plans, and by providing feedback on goal progress...|$|E

40|$|Background: This study {{aimed at}} {{assessing}} {{the effects of}} a self-regulation-based brief physical activity program for patients suffering from unexplained chronic fatigue, the “ 4 - STEPS to control your fatigue program”. Method: A 12 -week randomized controlled trial was conducted. Adult patients meeting the CDC criteria for idiopathic chronic fatigue were randomized to either the control condition (standard care) or the intervention condition (4 -STEPS). The 4 -STEPS was based on self-regulation principles and consisted of motivational interviewing and self-regulation skills training. All patients were assessed at baseline and post-treatment (12 weeks) for fatigue severity (primary outcome) and impact, physical activity (leisure time physical activity, number of daily steps and personal <b>activity</b> <b>goal</b> progress), health-related quality of life, somatic distress and psychological distress (depression and anxiety). Results Ninety-one patients (45 intervention and 46 control patients) received the allocated intervention. At post-treatment, statistical analysis revealed a significant difference for subjective experience of fatigue (4. 73 points; g= 0. 51) in favour of the intervention group. Mixed design ANCOVAs showed a significant effect of the 4 -STEPS on fatigue severity, leisure time physical activity, personal <b>activity</b> <b>goal</b> progress and healthrelated quality of life. No significant effects were found for number of daily steps and somatic and psychological distress. Conclusion: The 4 -STEPS program has significant beneficial effects at post-treatment. This brief self-regulation-based intervention looks promising for the management of unexplained chronic fatigue. Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT...|$|E

40|$|Background. Regular {{physical}} activity {{can help to}} prevent cardiovascular disease in women. Understanding midlife women’s exercise goals could offer insight into their motivational facilitators and barriers, and assist {{in the development of}} better primary prevention strategies for this population. Objectives. We sought to investigate the relationship between midlife women’s physical <b>activity</b> <b>goals</b> and their {{physical activity}} participation over time. Methods. A random sample of healthy, midlife women (40 – 60 years of age) was selected to participate in a longitudinal study (n � 156). This study fit a linear mixed model to the data to investigate the fixed effects of physical <b>activity</b> <b>goals</b> on physical <b>activity</b> participation, controlling for Body Mass Index (BMI) and Social Support. Mediational analyses were conducted to investigate whether commitment and planning mediated these results. Results. There were significant differences between participants with distinct types of <b>goals</b> on physical <b>activity</b> participation over time (i. e., baseline, 1 month, and 1 year postbaseline), controlling for the effects of BMI and Social Support. Participants with Weight Loss and Health Benefits goals participated in significantly less physical activity than those with Sense of Well-being and Stress Reduction goals. Commitment and Planning each mediated the relationship between participant goals and their physical activity participation. Conclusions. These data suggest having physical <b>activity</b> <b>goals</b> that aim to decrease weight or benefit health may not bode well for healthy midlife women who desire to sustain physically active lives. Instead, health care providers and health promotion specialists might better facilitate long-term participation among healthy women if they emphasize physical activity as a means to enhance their quality of life...|$|R

30|$|Studies also {{varied in}} number and {{combination}} of included intervention components and behaviour change techniques. Promotion of physical activity through a smartphone application in combination with a wearable is in most studies accompanied by other intervention components, such as counselling sessions. Hence, no conclusions could be drawn about the isolated effect of wearables and smartphone applications on physical activity. Schoeppe et al. [28] showed that only offering a smartphone application is less effective than offering a smartphone application with additional intervention components. As a result, compared to only offering a wearable and smartphone application, intervention effects may be larger when the intervention is accompanied with other intervention components. Furthermore, goal setting {{is one of the}} most important behaviour change techniques to increase physical activity [53]. In most studies, physical activity goals were individualized, which may be more effective in promoting physical activity compared to general physical activity goals [55]. Other sources of heterogeneity might be variation in intervention duration and differences between control groups across studies, ranging from usual care to having a physical <b>activity</b> <b>goal.</b>|$|E

Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} either an intervention group or a standard-care control group.

Four and 12 months later, physical exercise levels were half a standard deviation higher in the intervention group.

Mediation analyses were performed to study the potential mechanism that accounted for the reduction in depression. Perceived attainment of exercise goals, but not physical exercise itself, emerged as a mediator between the intervention and the reduction of depressive symptoms. As such attainment of personal goals appears to be of particular importance for lowering depressive symptoms during health-behavior change.

Materials and Methods: Level of intracellular ROS was measured flow cytometrically in erythrocytes from venous blood of 21 patients with generalized vitiligo and 21 healthy volunteers using the probe dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. Results: The levels of ROS differed significantly between patients and healthy controls, as well as between active versus stable disease groups. In the active disease group, ROS levels were significantly lower in those being treated with systemic steroids than those that were not. ROS levels poorly correlated with disease duration or body surface area involved.
