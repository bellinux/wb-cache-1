40|$|The authors {{analyzed}} etiological {{factors and}} special issues of diagnostics of inflammatory {{diseases of the}} pharynx associated with pain in children. According to etiological factors tonsillopharyngitis {{can be divided into}} two main forms: bacterial and viral. The prevalence of viral tonsillopharyngitis is respectively high and, in contrast to bacterial form, this one does not demand systemic antibacterial treatment. The article contains information on the main medicines used for topical treatment of viral inflammation of the pharynx: saline solutions and antiseptic agents. The most appropriate topical antiseptic drug for children with tonsillopharyngitis is combined ones with <b>amylmetacresol</b> and dichlorobenzyl alcohol, not lidocain-containing or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ones. The high analgesic effect of such combination is shown in various studies. Moreover, it was found, that hexylresorcinol and <b>amylmetacresol</b> inhibit sodium channels 10 - 20 times more intensely than lidocain. Significant analgesic effect of amylmetacresol/dichlorobenzyl alcohol is observed in 5 minutes after administration and its duration is 2 hours. Decrease of virulence of influenza A, respiratory syncytial and coronaviruses under exposure to <b>amylmetacresol</b> and dichlorobenzyl alcohol was also proved. Availability of several medicinal forms and its high pharmacological safety make this drug the most optimal for treatment of pain syndrome in tonsillopharyngitis in children. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2013. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Background Acute sore throat (pharyngitis) {{is one of}} the most common illnesses for which children are seen by primary care physicians. Most cases are caused by viruses and are benign and self-limiting. Clinically proven, over-the-counter throat lozenges provide rapid and effective relief of acute sore throat symptoms, and are increasingly important in self-management of this condition. Objective The purpose of this study (International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number: ISRCTN 34958871) was to evaluate the acceptability of two licensed, commercially available sore throat lozenges containing <b>amylmetacresol</b> and 2, 4 -dichlorobenzyl (AMC/ DCBA) —one strawberry flavored and the other orang...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAcute {{sore throat}} is a minor, {{self-limiting}} ailment, but patients commonly seek advice and treatment for immediate symptomatic relief. However, most sore throats due to {{upper respiratory tract}} infections are viral in nature, and antibiotics often prescribed are not suitable {{for the treatment of}} sore throat, as reflected in many European guidelines. Many topical treatments are available over the counter, including throat sprays, gargles and lozenges. We discuss some of the 'ideal' features of over-the-counter options in the treatment of simple sore throat cases. The main features include the direct targeting of the viral and inflammatory causes, the provision of local pain relief, rapid onset of action and prolonged duration of action, effectiveness over a range of different types of sore throat, an ability to address the emotional aspects associated with having a sore throat and a good safety profile. Some recent clinical and experimental evidence on the efficacy and postulated mechanism of action for <b>amylmetacresol</b> and 2, 4 -dichlorobenzyl alcohol-containing lozenges, that have been marketed for many years are also discussed as an illustration of such targeted approach...|$|E
40|$|Martina Morokutti-Kurz, Christine Graf, Eva Prieschl-Grassauer Marinomed Biotechnologie GmbH, Vienna, Austria Abstract: Up to 80 % of sore throats {{are caused}} by viruses. Several over the counter {{products}} are available which provide symptomatic, not causal relief. For such lozenges, containing the antiseptics and local anesthetics <b>amylmetacresol</b> (AMC) and 2, 4 -dichlorobenzyl alcohol (DCBA) or hexylresorcinol (HR), recently an additional virucidal effect was published. Therefore, we tested a set of Strepsils® lozenges, containing either HR (Max [# 2]) or AMC/DCBA (Original [# 3], Extra Strong [# 4], Warm [# 5], Orange and Vitamin C [# 6], Sugar free Lemon [# 7], Children/Strawberry [# 8] and Soothing Honey and Lemon [# 9]) for their antiviral efficiency against representatives of respiratory viruses known to cause sore throat: human rhinovirus (HRV) 1 a, HRV 8, influenza virus A H 1 N 1 n, Coxsackievirus A 10, and human coronavirus (hCoV) OC 43. The lozenges were tested {{head to head with}} Coldamaris® lozenges (# 1), which contain the patented antiviral iota-carrageenan. None of the tested AMC/DCBA or HR containing lozenges shows any antiviral effectiveness against HRV 8 at the tested concentrations, whereas all are moderately active against HRV 1 a. Only lozenge # 5 shows any activity against hCoV OC 43 and Coxsackievirus A 10 at the tested concentrations. Similarly, only lozenge # 3 is moderately active against influenza A H 1 N 1 n virus. The data indicates that neither the isolated effect of the active ingredients nor the pH but rather {{one or more of the}} excipients of the specific formulations are responsible for the antiviral effect of some of the AMC/DCBA or HR containing lozenges. In contrast, carrageenan-containing lozenges are highly active against all viruses tested. In another experiment, we showed that binding and inactivation of virus particles by iota-carrageenan are fast and highly effective. During the residence time of the lozenge in the mouth, the viral titer is reduced by 85 % and 91 % for influenza A virus and hCoV OC 43, respectively. Carrageenan-containing lozenges are, therefore, suitable as causative therapy against viral infections of the throat. Keywords: local anesthetics, polymer, antiviral, respiratory viruse...|$|E
