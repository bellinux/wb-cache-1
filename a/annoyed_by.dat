5|$|Box {{lacrosse}} is {{a modern}} version of the game that was invented in Canada during the 1920s and 1930s. The roots of indoor lacrosse are obscure, but its invention {{has been attributed to}} one Paddy Brennan, a field lacrosse player and referee from Montreal, who, being <b>annoyed</b> <b>by</b> the constant slowing of play from balls going out of bounds in the field game, experimented with indoor games at the Mount Royal Arena during the early 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{continued}} {{to maintain the}} diplomatic relations with the Tsardom of Russia originally established by her deceased brother. She often wrote to Ivan IV ("Ivan the Terrible"), on amicable terms, though the Tsar was often <b>annoyed</b> <b>by</b> her focus on commerce {{rather than on the}} possibility of a military alliance.

The band's reception on September 3 at the Hollywood Bowl was more favorable.|$|E
5|$|However, his {{attitude}} {{could not be}} maintained. Landowners were infuriated by the unwillingness {{of the government to}} use force, while the peasants were <b>annoyed</b> <b>by</b> the unwillingness to redistribute land from the latifundia. Landowners matched the strike with a lockout, and many peasants, probably a majority in the strike centres, were left without tenancies when the planting season ended in mid-December. In December 1893 the failure of the Giolitti government to restore public order gave rise to a general demand that Crispi should return to power. Giolitti had to resign on November 24, 1893, {{as a result of the}} Banca Romana scandal.|$|E
5|$|Moe is {{impressed}} by Homer's ability to absorb severe punishment and suggests he take up boxing, with Moe – a former boxer himself – as his trainer and manager. Marge is <b>annoyed</b> <b>by</b> the idea, but a medical test diagnoses Homer {{with a rare}} genetic abnormality effectively rendering him near-invulnerable to knockout punches.

Moe strategizes that Homer should stand still in the ring and let his opponents exhaust themselves trying to knock him out, and then knock them down with a tap.|$|E
50|$|The mute violin is {{a violin}} without {{or with a}} very shallow sound box. The {{instrument}} has a quiet, lean sound. The mute violin {{can be used as}} an exercise instrument in situations where the sound of a violin is experienced as <b>annoying</b> <b>by</b> neighbouring people.

5|$|On graduation, Kraft {{accepted}} {{a job with}} the Chance Vought aircraft company in Connecticut. He had also sent an application to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), a government agency whose Langley Research Center was located in Hampton, Virginia; Kraft considered it to be too close to home, but applied as insurance. On arrival at Chance Vought he was told that he could not be inducted without his birth certificate, which he had not brought with him. <b>Annoyed</b> <b>by</b> the bureaucratic mindset of the company, he decided to accept the offer from NACA instead.|$|E
5|$|The closing titles use a {{different}} arrangement of the theme, sung by countertenor Jeremy Jackman, with lyrics (usually insulting Blackadder) that reflect {{the events of the}} preceding episode. The song is played over a shot of Blackadder strolling through a formal garden and being <b>annoyed</b> <b>by</b> the lute-wielding minstrel (Tony Aitken). This sequence was incorporated as a separate subplot, with Blackadder constantly attempting to apprehend the musician each time with limited success. At the end of the final episode, Blackadder catches the minstrel and repeatedly dunks him in a fountain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Annoyed</b> <b>by</b> Peter's {{constant}} shocking, Brian professes his discomfort by referencing {{his anger}} after O. J. Simpson {{was acquitted of}} charges in the O. J. Simpson murder case. After Lois expresses her hope for the restaurant to be successful, Stewie sarcastically states {{that it will be}} just as successful as Liza Minnelli's Playboy photoshoot. Returning home from the restaurant, Peter and Lois decide to watch an episode of Maude, but the length of the opening theme song causes Peter to become fatigued by the show. Once the restaurant begins hemorrhaging money, Peter decides to shoot a commercial parodying M. Night Shyamalan's 1999 film The Sixth Sense. After Joe's handicapped friends take over the restaurant, Peter expresses his discomfort about the restaurant's coolness to Lois by retrieving a picture of American actor Mark Harmon and showing it to Lois in an attempt to make her understand his concern.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology with which aircraft designs {{can be modified}} such that they produce optimal sound signatures on the ground. With optimal sound it is implied in this case sounds that are perceived as less <b>annoying</b> <b>by</b> residents living near airport vicinities. A novel design and assessment chain has been developed which combines the aircraft design process with an auralization and sound quality assessment capability. It is demonstrated how different commercial aircraft can be designed, their sounds auralized at representative locations in airport vicinities and subsequently assessed for sound quality. As sound quality {{is closely related to}} the perceived annoyance, it is expected that designs with improved sound quality would also be perceived as less <b>annoying.</b> <b>By</b> providing a feedback to the design optimizer in terms of one of the sound quality metrics or a suitable combination thereof, the designs of aircraft can be altered to produce potentially less annoying sounds. The paper will focus on three current aircraft and will demonstrate the application of the novel design chain to auralize and alter their sounds toward improved sound quality. The presented methodology can also be extended to unconventional aircraft configurations and propulsion concepts, for optimizing future aircraft sounds.

5|$|Berryman {{was also}} {{involved}} in the plan's execution, once more becoming chief of staff at New Guinea Force under Blamey in August 1943. Berryman was frustrated at the failure of Vasey's 7th Division to destroy the Japanese retreating from Lae, and personally <b>annoyed</b> <b>by</b> the way that Vasey forwarded compliments to Major General Ennis Whitehead while leaving any complaints about air support to be taken up by Berryman. Berryman was next involved with the planning for the landing at Finschhafen, brokering a compromise landing plan between Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey and Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring. When Berryman discovered that the United States Seventh Fleet {{did not intend to}} reinforce the 9th Division he immediately went to Blamey, who took the matter up with MacArthur. However, it was Berryman who brokered a compromise deal with Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender to reinforce Finschhafen with a battalion in APDs.|$|E
5|$|Dexter {{manages to}} keep the lab a secret from his clueless, cheerful Mom (voiced by Kath Soucie) and Dad (voiced by Jeff Bennett), who never take notice of it.

In spite of Dexter's advanced technology, Dee Dee eludes all manner of security, and once inside her brother's laboratory, she delights in playing haphazardly, often wreaking havoc with his inventions. Though seemingly dim-witted, Dee Dee often outsmarts her brother and even gives him helpful advice. For his part, Dexter, though <b>annoyed</b> <b>by</b> his intrusive sibling, feels a reluctant affection for her and will come to her defense if she is imperiled.|$|E

After meeting Shuichi, Fumiya becomes jealous of Saori's interest in Shuichi, and finds Shuichi's cross-dressing gross. While initially lying to Saori and Shuichi about having an interest in cross-dressing, he is later seen dressed as a girl while out with Shuichi, and again at the cultural festival at Shuichi's school. Fumiya enjoys the added attention that comes from cross-dressing and admits that he likes being called cute.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 26 October 1978, {{about a week after}} the {{extermination}} threat, George Burkitt and his 20-year-old son Philip were working on Philip's Triumph Spitfire car in front of their house. At around 7pm, <b>annoyed</b> <b>by</b> the noise they were making, Williams shot them both with a 9mm, Smith & Wesson automatic pistol. George died where he fell and Philip, wounded, ran into the house. Williams followed him, shooting him again and killing him. He then shot and killed George's wife, Iris. The Burkitts' 17-year-old daughter was hit four times in the back and once in the thigh, but survived. Two other neighbours, a married couple who had witnessed the attack on the Burkitts, also survived being shot. The injured were treated at Birmingham General Hospital.|$|E
50|$|Reeves {{believed}} {{the purpose of}} advertising is to sell. He insisted that an advertisement or commercial should show off the value or unique selling proposition, (or USP) of a product, not the cleverness or humor of a copywriter. His most typical ad is probably that for Anacin, a headache medicine. The ad was considered grating and <b>annoying</b> <b>by</b> almost all viewers but it was remarkably successful, tripling the product's sales. In 7 years the 59-second commercial made {{more money than the}} movie Gone With The Wind had in a quarter-century.|$|R

5000|$|In surfing, {{shoulder}} surfing refers to shoulder hopping. Shoulder hoppers {{do not take}} off on the critical part of the wave {{where there is a}} need for a high level of skill, but take off further down the line.
