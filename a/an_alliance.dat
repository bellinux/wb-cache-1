5|$|Abaqa died in 1282 and {{was briefly}} {{replaced}} {{by his brother}} Tekuder, who had converted to Islam. Tekuder reversed Abaqa's policy of seeking <b>an</b> <b>alliance</b> with the Franks, offering instead <b>an</b> <b>alliance</b> to the Mamluk Sultan Qalawun, who continued his own advance, capturing the Hospitaller fortress of Margat in 1285, Lattakia in 1287, and the County of Tripoli in 1289. However, Tekuder's pro-Muslim stance was not popular, and in 1284, Abaqa's Buddhist son Arghun, {{with the support of}} the Great Khan Kublai, led a revolt and had Tekuder executed. Arghun then revived the idea of <b>an</b> <b>alliance</b> with the West, and sent multiple envoys to Europe.|$|E

To help achieve his goal, he formed <b>an</b> <b>alliance</b> with the King of the Seleucid Empire, Antiochus the Great, against Ptolemy V of Egypt (the Seleucid Empire and Egypt were the other two Diadochi states). Philip began attacking the lands of Ptolemy and Rhodes's allies in Thrace and around the Propontis.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the influence of}} the structure and composition of <b>a</b> firm's <b>alliance</b> network on its exploratory innovation. In a longitudinal investigation of 77 telecommunications equipment manufacturers, I find the technological diversity of <b>a</b> firm's <b>alliance</b> partners increases its exploratory innovation. I also find that network density among <b>a</b> firm's <b>alliance</b> partners strengthens the influence of diversity. These results suggest the benefits of network closure and access to diverse information can coexist in <b>a</b> firm's <b>alliance</b> network and the combination of the two increases exploratory innovation...|$|R

5|$|At {{about the}} time of his union with Cacht, Donnchad aspired to become High King of Ireland. With {{powerful}} maritime forces at his command, Echmarcach would have certainly been regarded as an important potential ally. Clear evidence of <b>an</b> <b>alliance</b> between Echmarcach and the Uí Briain is preserved by the twelfth-century Banshenchas, a text which records the marriage of Echmarcach's daughter, Mór, to Tadc (died 1086), son of Toirdelbach Ua Briain (died 1086). Annalistic evidence of such <b>an</b> <b>alliance</b> is found well into the late eleventh century. In fact, kinship between Echmarcach's descendants and the Uí Briain even led to the accession of one of Echmarcach's maternal grandsons, Domnall mac Taidc (died 1115), to the kingship of the Isles at about the turn of the twelfth century.|$|E
5|$|During {{the siege}} of Amphipolis, the Chalkidian League, led by Olynthos, began to fear Philip's {{territorial}} ambitions (since Amphipolis also controlled access to Chalkidiki), and therefore sought to ally with Athens against him.

Philip himself feared <b>an</b> <b>alliance</b> of the powerful Chalkidian League and Athens, so he moved to reassure the Olynthians by offering them <b>an</b> <b>alliance</b> on very advantageous terms. As part of the agreement with Olynthos, Philip was to capture the city of Potidea, located in {{the territory of the}} Chalkidian League. Potidea was at that time under the control of Athens, and represented a threat to the stability of the league.|$|E

Philip, however, declined the proposal and {{in the winter of}} 203 BC-202 BC, he formed <b>an</b> <b>alliance</b> with Antiochus and organised the partition of the Ptolemaic Empire.
