5|$|According to USA Today, the match-up {{between the}} Longhorns and the Ohio State Buckeyes (OSU) {{was one of}} the most-anticipated games of the 2005season. Teams have become {{increasingly}} conservative in scheduling highly ranked non-conference opponents, so a meeting of the number 2 and number 4 teams in the country was unusual this early in the season. Because of the significance of the game in the national championship race, ESPN College GameDay chose the game <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> its weekly broadcast. The American Football Coaches Association brought the national championship trophy to the game and displayed it on the field near Bevo, the UT mascot (photo below).|$|E
5|$|After the Russian Revolution, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic's capital {{moved from}} Kharkiv to Kiev in 1934, {{and the city}} {{was in need of}} a {{suburban}} residence for government officials. Mezhyhirya was chosen <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the new government residence. The decision of the Politburo in April 1935 ordered the demolition of the whole complex. Before the scheduled demolition in 1936, the architecture and buildings of the monastic complex were photographed. During the demolition, an underground library was discovered, full of handwritten manuscripts. There are speculations that the discovered books belonged to the lost library of Yaroslav the Wise, or perhaps of a later period, during the times of the Zaporozhian Host. The only thing that remains now of the monastic complex is a water well.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with most}} of the Riverina region, the {{majority}} of Wagga Wagga residents supported the federation of the Australian colonies, in large part due to the prospect of free trade across colonial borders. In 1898, a group of residents promoted Wagga Wagga for consideration <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the future national capital due to its location equidistant from Sydney and Melbourne and its ample water supply. Despite the bid's lack of success, in the 1899 referendum Wagga Wagga residents voted strongly in favour of federation.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the city}} of Mahabalipuram was {{constructed}} by the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I in the 7th century AD, {{there is evidence that}} a small port might have functioned at the site even earlier. Megalithic burial urns dating to the very dawn of the Christian era have been discovered near Mahabalipuram. The Sangam age poem Perumpāṇāṟṟuppaṭai describes a port called Nirppeyyaru which some scholars identify with the present-day Mahabalipuram. Sadras near Mahabalipuram has been identified <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the port of Sopatma mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the Necropolis station {{had been}} {{intentionally}} chosen {{to abut the}} arches of the LSWR's viaduct, it acted {{as an obstacle to}} any {{increase in the number of}} lines serving Waterloo station. Urban growth in the area of what is now south west London, through which trains from Waterloo ran, led to congestion at the station, only slightly alleviated by the LSWR's 1877 takeover of the western LNC track. In the 1890s the situation became untenable, and the LSWR began to investigate the possibility of repositioning the LNC station to permit the expansion of the main line terminus.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1850s, St. Louis hosted annual {{agricultural}} and mechanical fairs at Fairground Park {{to connect with}} regional manufacturers and growers. By the 1880s, the connection to agriculture had declined, and in 1883, a new St. Louis Exposition and Music Hall was built to house industrial exhibits. In 1890, St. Louis attempted to host the World's Columbian Exposition, but the project was awarded to Chicago, which hosted the exposition in 1893. In 1899, delegates from states that {{had been part of}} the Louisiana Purchase met in St. Louis, selecting it <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> a world's fair celebrating the centennial of the purchase in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Capitol Hill {{had been}} {{proposed}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> a subway stop in unimplemented plans from 1911 and 1968, but voter approval {{did not come}} until 1996. It was built {{as part of the}} University Link Extension, which began construction in 2009 and opened on March 19, 2016. Construction of the station required the demolition of two city blocks along Broadway, which will be redeveloped into a transit-oriented, mixed-use complex in 2019. Light rail trains serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between trains is 6 minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. The station is also served by the First Hill Streetcar and several King County Metro bus routes at nearby stops.|$|E

5|$|Gatwick Airport, {{nowadays}} one of Britain's busiest international airports, {{opened on}} the edge of the town in the 1940s, encouraging commercial and industrial growth. After the Second World War, the British Government planned to move large numbers of people and jobs out of London and into new towns around South East England. The New Towns Act 1946 designated Crawley <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> one of these. A master plan was developed for the establishment of new residential, commercial, industrial and civic areas, and rapid development greatly increased the size and population of the town over a few decades.|$|E
5|$|I-75 {{parallels}} to M-85 (Fort Street) and follows the Detroit River as far east as the Ambassador Bridge. Near the bridge's approaches, the freeway turns 90° {{away from the}} river and intersects {{the eastern end of}} I-96 before turning again to follow the river further inland. From there, I-75 meets M-10 (Lodge Freeway) and crosses under M-1 (Woodward Avenue). East of Woodward, the freeway travels past both Comerica Park and Ford Field, homes of the Detroit Tigers and Detroit Lions professional sports teams, respectively, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> Little Caesars Arena, the future home of the Detroit Red Wings and Detroit Pistons.|$|E
5|$|In 1854, the Diocese of Chichester {{selected}} {{an area of}} open land on {{the west}} side of Ditchling Road <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> their Training College for Anglican Schoolmistresses, which had outgrown its premises in Black Lion Street in the old town. Viaduct Road was built in front of the Gothic Revival building's south façade around the same time, and was built up with terraced houses by the early 1860s. In the early 20th century, the Diocese bought three of the four villas nearby and converted them into accommodation for trainee schoolteachers. Before that, the trainee teachers slept in large rooms in the Training College.|$|E
40|$|The gutter’ is {{the space}} between panels where panel {{transitions}} happen—readers {{fill in the blank}} space by connecting panels {{to make sense of the}} story. In GB Tran’s 'Vietnamerica' (2010), however, black gutters become part of black ‘bleeds’ (pages congruent with single panels in them) to portray <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> a trauma. This article argues that if bleeds, as Scott McCloud claims, can depict timeless space, they could also represent <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> a trauma where the memory of the past is intervened by the future interpretation of the memory. In 'Vietnamerica', the panels in black in a waffle-iron grid are simultaneously black gutters and a black bleed, where reinterpretation of trauma takes place as speech balloons are later imposed on the same recurrent waffle-iron grid. While Cathy Caruth’s trauma theory helps read Tran’s black bleeds <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> a trauma, <b>the</b> latter also extends Caruth’s notion of ‘traumatic awakenings’ since <b>the</b> black bleeds <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> a trauma turn into the places of reconciliation and healing...|$|R
