Currently, four different simulation systems are available for training and developing skills in robotic surgery, each attempting to convey a standardized curriculum that can be assessed via standardized metrics, while providing limited assistive cueing and feedback to support a level of unsupervised learning (Smith et al., 2015). Three of the four simulators have demonstrated the ability to improve basic robotic skills, resulting in skills comparable with those obtained on dry laboratory simulation (Bric, Lumbard, Frelich, & Gould, 2016). Training, however, continues to rely heavily on instruction and guidance provided by a human instructor.|$|R

40|$|Satellite {{measurements}} {{are subject to}} a wide range of uncertainties due to their temporal, spatial, and directional sampling characteristics. An information-theory approach is suggested to examine the nonuniform temporal sampling of ERB measurements. The information (i. e., its entropy or uncertainty) before and after the measurements is determined, and information gain (IG) is defined as a reduction in the uncertainties involved. A stochastic model for the diurnal outgoing flux variations that affect the ERB is developed. Using Gaussian distributions for the a priori and measured radiant exitance fields, the IG is obtained by computing the a posteriori covariance. The IG for the monthly outgoing flux measurements is examined for different orbital parameters and orbital tracks, using the Earth Observing System orbital parameters as specific examples. Variations in IG due to changes in the orbit's inclination angle and the <b>initial</b> <b>ascending</b> node local time are investigated...|$|R

Because the clinical, radiographic and histopathologic characteristics {{are similar to}} those of a variety of benign and malignant tumors, it poses a diagnostic dilemma. This report presents a case of an aggressive osteoblastoma in the mandible and discusses the differential diagnosis of this lesion. A 13 -year-old white male sought the Stomatology Clinic at the State University of Para&# 237;ba, Campina Grande, PB, Brazil, complaining of asymptomatic swelling on the left side of his face.

40|$|AbstractMembers of {{the bone}} {{morphogenetic}} protein family of secreted protein signals have been implicated as axon guidance cues for specific neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans and in mammals. We have examined axonal pathfinding in mice lacking the secreted bone morphogenetic protein antagonist Noggin. We have found defects in projection of several groups of neurons, including the <b>initial</b> <b>ascending</b> projections from the dorsal root ganglia, motor axons innervating the distal forelimb, and cranial nerve VII. The case of the dorsal root ganglion defect is especially interesting: initial projections from the dorsal root ganglion enter the dorsal root entry zone, as normal, but then project directly into the gray matter of the spinal cord, rather than turning rostrally and caudally. Explant experiments suggest that the defect lies within the spinal cord and not the dorsal root ganglion itself. However, exogenous bone morphogenetic proteins are unable to attract or repel these axons, and the spinal cord shows only very subtle alterations in dorsal–ventral pattern in Noggin mutants. We suggest that the defect in projection into the spinal cord is likely the result of bone morphogenetic proteins disrupting the transduction of some unidentified repulsive signal from the spinal cord gray matter...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Controversy exists {{regarding}} {{the role of}} PD 1 and its ligand PD-L 1 in chronic hepatitis B infection. In some studies, persistent HBV infection {{has been attributed to}} high levels of PD- 1 and PD-L 1 expression on HBV-specific T-cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) respectively. Other studies revealed that the up-regulation of PD- 1 and PD-L 1 during an acute inflammation phase is required to offset increasing positive co-stimulatory signals to avoid severe damage by an over-vigorous immune response. Methods Fifteen chronic hepatitis B patients, with inflammatory flare episode, were recruited prospectively. Based on serum HBV-DNA, HBsAg load, and ALT values, inflammatory flare episode were divided into initial, climax, decline and regression phase. Blood sample and liver biopsy tissues from each individual were taken in these 4 phases respectively. Circulating and intra-hepatic PD 1 and PD-L 1 expression levels were monitored throughout the inflammatory flare episode by flow cytometry and immunostaining and these expression levels were related to the HBV-specific T-cell changes, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, HBV-DNA replication and HBV antigen load. Results]The levels of PD- 1 and PD-L 1 expressions were significantly up-regulated in the inflammation <b>ascending</b> phase, <b>initial</b> and climax period and in parallel with HBV-specific colon expansion. It showed increasing the level of serum ALT and decreasing the HBV-DNA loads. As the level of inflammation reduced, the circulating and intra-hepatic PD 1 and circulating PD-L 1 decreased progressively in concordance with serum ALT, HBV-DNA and HBsAg loads decreased except intra-hepatic PD- 1 expression. Intra-hepatic PD-L 1 expression did not decrease significantly during the regression phase of inflammation compared to that in prior period. The intra-hepatic PD-L 1 expression remained relatively on higher level when serum HBV-DNA load and ALT decreased to approximately normal range. Conclusion The relatively high level of intra-hepatic PD-L 1 expression during the inflammatory regression period may contribute to constitute an immunosuppressive microenvironment, which facilitate persistent HBV infection via the inhibition of HBV-specific T cell clonal expansion. </p...|$|R

The investigated field {{corresponds to the}} region immediately downstream of the valve outlet i. e. the <b>initial</b> <b>ascending</b> part of the aorta. The aim of the paper is to investigate {{the evolution of the}} flow field in time in such inhomogeneous, anisotropic, and unsteady conditions. To do this, a high-speed video camera is used to acquire images of the seeding particles illuminated by a continuous infrared laser. high seeding density conditions are investigated using PIV to perform phase-sampled Eulerian averages, whereas low seeding conditions are used to determine particle trajectories and Lagrangian statistics using PTV. Both are needed for the complete description of the magnitude and duration of the stress on blood cells. The following features are described: – The very high inhomogeneity and unsteadiness of the phenomenon – The presence of large scale vortices within the field especially in the sinuses of Valsalva and {{in the wake of the}} valve leaflets – The strong stress and strain rates at the jet–wake interface downstream of the leaflets and close to largescale vortices – The non-negligible time spent by fluid particles in some of the high stress and strain region...|$|R
3000|$|There {{is no real}} {{reference}} {{region of}} [18 F]flumazenil in the mouse brain, and we therefore applied a more complicated kinetic analysis using either an image-derived input function or whole blood tracer concentration. Mean [18 F]flumazenil TACs in the two brain ROIs (hippocampus and the frontal cortex) and the left ventricle from the isoflurane and ket/dex groups were calculated by averaging of the individual recordings. For the ex vivo groups, the average [18 F]flumazenil TACs in the two brain ROIs and for whole blood were obtained by averaging individually measured curves within the group. A parametric model defined by a straight line <b>ascending</b> to the <b>initial</b> peak followed by a tri-exponential decay was fitted to the mean heart TACs and the average whole blood curve. The image-derived blood curves were not corrected for the metabolism of [18 F]flumazenil because multiple blood samples could not be performed in same mice. The contribution of vascular radioactivity to the regional brain target TACs was corrected prior to analysis, assuming a 5 % blood volume. The corrected target TACs in each dataset were then fitted using one-tissue compartment (1 TC) and two-tissue compartment (2 TC) models [40], with the fitted average heart TAC serving as an image-derived input function for the isoflurane and ket/dex groups, and the fitted average whole blood curve for the ex vivo awake and dex groups.

In this study, microlocalization of mRNA coding for V 1 a and V 2 receptors {{was carried out in}} the rat kidney using a reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction. Large signals for V 1 a receptor PCR product were detected in the glomerulus, initial cortical collecting duct, cortical collecting duct, outer medullary collecting duct, inner medullary collecting duct, and arcuate artery. Small but detectable signals were found in proximal convoluted and straight tubules, inner medullary thin limbs, and medullary thick ascending limbs. Large signals for V 2 receptor mRNA were detected in the cortical collecting duct, outer medullary collecting duct, and inner medullary collecting duct. Small signals for V 2 receptor were found in the inner medullary thick limbs, medullary thick <b>ascending</b> limbs, and <b>initial</b> cortical collecting duct. Next, we investigated V 1 a and V 2 receptor mRNA regulation in the dehydrated state. During a 72 -h water restriction state, the plasma AVP level increased and V 2 receptor mRNA decreased in collecting ducts. In contrast, V 1 a receptor mRNA did not change significantly. Thus, the two AVP receptor subtypes are distributed differently along the nephron, and these mRNAs are regulated differently in the dehydrated state...|$|R
40|$|A {{protocol}} for programmed ventricular stimulation {{is described in}} which the effect of increasing stimulation current on ventricular refractoriness and arrhythmia induction was specifically examined. The protocol was evaluated prospectively in 70 patients undergoing electrophysiological study for documented or suspected ventricular arrhythmias. Programmed electrical stimulation was performed at the right ventricular apex and outflow tract using single and double extrastimuli and burst pacing. Stimulation currents of 2, 5, 10, and 20 mA were used in <b>ascending</b> order. The <b>initial</b> (lowest) current was never less than twice diastolic threshold and was maintained during each stimulation run until refractoriness was reached. The current was then increased {{to the next level}} to facilitate premature capture until refractoriness was encountered at 20 mA or a sustained arrhythmia occurred. Ventricular arrhythmias were induced in 34 patients, 31 of whom had presented with a sustained ventricular arrhythmia. The incidence of induced arrhythmias was low in those patients who had presented with symptoms alone, a non-sustained arrhythmia, or a sustained arrhythmia in association with a predisposing clinical event. Only one patient with a negative result had further ventricular arrhythmias during the mean follow up period of 15 months. Although each increase in stimulation current caused a decrease in measured ventricular refractoriness, this resulted in only four arrhythmias. Only one arrhythmia was induced above 5 mA. These results suggest that this simple protocol using two extrastimuli and a single stimulation current of 5 mA will reliably identify most patients who have symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias...|$|R
40|$|Progressive wave loading {{strategies}} are common within {{strength and conditioning}} practice. The {{purpose of this study}} was to contribute to the understanding of this strategy by evaluating the effectiveness of 2 wave loading bench press training programmes that differed only in the initial load that was used to start the first wave. Thirty-four resistance-trained men were divided into 2 groups and performed 2 training sessions each week for 20 weeks. One session consisted of 6 sets of 2 repetitions, while the other consisted of 5 sets of 5 repetitions. The load used was incremented by 2. 5 % of one repetition maximum (1 RM) each week until the subject could no longer complete the programmed repetitions. At this point, the load was decreased, and then started to <b>ascend</b> again. The <b>initial</b> loads for the 2 sessions were 87. 5 % and 80 % 1 RM respectively for the heavier group, and for the lighter group were 82. 5 % and 75 % 1 RM. The subjects experienced a significant improvement in their bench press performance (higher load group: pre test = 106. 5 kg ± 14. 6, post test = 112. 2 kg ± 12. 4, p ≤ 0. 05; lower load group: pre test = 105. 7 kg ± 14. 1, post test = 114. 3 kg ± 11. 0, p ≤ 0. 05), but there was no difference in the magnitude of the improvment between the two groups. These results tend to support the common practical recommendation to start with a lighter load when employing a progressive wave loading strategy, as such a strategy yields similar improvements in performance with a lower level of exertion in training...|$|R

Two of these dams have Denil fish ladders {{and the third}} one has a jump-pool ladder. Our study objectives were: 1) to compare redband trout delays among the three dams, 2) to determine whether trout experienced greater passage delay in entering the fish ladders or in <b>ascending</b> after the <b>initial</b> entry, and 3) to identify relationships between passage likelihood and water temperature, discharge, daylight, and fish fork length. An array of Passive Interrogation Transponder (PIT) antennas detected tagged trout, first, when they approached each dam, subsequently when they entered its ladder, and finally {{when they reached the}} upper end of that ladder. Therefore, data on ladder entry time, ladder ascending time, and total passage time for individual trout were obtained. Statistical methods for survival analysis were used because they handled both censored data and time-dependent covariates. The results showed that trout were 7 times more likely to pass the jumppool ladder during the day than during the night, but none of the other parameters were significantly associated with the likelihood of passage. Trout passage varied significantly between each of the dams. The expected median passage time was 0. 07 days at one of the Denil fish ladders, 2. 1 days at the jump-pool ladder, and 20. 4 days at the other Denil ladder. At all three passage installations, a greater proportion of the total passage time involved ladder entry than ladder ascending. Entry time ranged from 14. 6 to 71. 5 times longer than ascending time among the three ladders. Our results revealed highly variable passage likelihood and time depending on ladder design, location and attraction flows...|$|R
40|$|The Wangshi group basalts cropped out in Daxizhuang, Jiaolai basin, eastern Shandong, {{belong to}} high-Ti {{alkaline}} basalt series. The basalt was emplaced at Late Cretaceous with Ar- 40 -Ar- 39 plateau age of 73. 2 +/- 0. 3 Ma. The basalt is enriched in Na 2 O and has Mg# values of 63 similar to 66 and normative (Ne-Hy-Q) of 6. 03 similar to 11. 05, suggesting a depths of generation of 50 similar to 70 km for the basalt. The enrichment of light {{rare earth elements}} (LREE) with (La/Yb) (N) of 11. 18 similar to 12. 56 and large ion lithophile elements (LILE), such as Th and Zr, and reletively differentiated {{heavy rare earth element}} (HREE) patterns suggest a continental intraplate setting. High Positive epsilon(Nd) (T) value of 7. 08 similar to 7. 55 and low Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 (T) ratio of 0. 7035 similar to 0. 7038 for basalt in Daxizhuang suggest that the basalt was virtually not contaminated by crustal materials during their <b>ascending</b> and the <b>initial</b> basltic magma was generated by a depleted mantle source. The parantal basaltic magma was a mixture of melts derived from the asthenospheric mantle and young depleted lithospheric mantle. Mantle derived spinel-iherzolite xenoliths have been discovered in the basalt. The estimated equilibrium P-T condition of xenoliths was about 20 kb and 1010 similar to 1140 degreesC. The estimated equilibrium P-T condition of xenoliths and depth of the generation of the basaltic magma suggested that the lithosphric thickness in Jiaozhou area was about 60 similar to 70 km in Late Cretaceous. This further inferred that the lithospheric thinning and asthenospheric upwelling in eastern China took place at 125 to 73 Ma B. C.

40|$|Vertical {{profiles}} of aerosol extinction obtained with the CALIOP lidar onboard CALIPSO {{are used in}} conjunction with the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model and NOAA's HYSPLIT trajectory model to document three aerosol export events from East Asia to the Arctic in the year 2007. During each of these events CALIOP sampled the pollution plumes multiple times over periods of five to seven days. Midlatitude cyclones lifted the pollution to the free troposphere with net diabatic heating of ~ 5 °C day − 1 and precipitation in this <b>initial</b> <b>ascending</b> stage. Rapid meridional transport to the Arctic took place at 3 – 7 km altitude, and was mediated by either a blocking high pressure system in the NW Pacific or a trough-ridge configuration. Once in the Arctic transport was nearly isentropic with slow subsidence and radiative cooling at a rate of 1 – 1. 5 °C day − 1. We find good agreement between modeled and observed plumes in terms of length, altitude, thickness and, within the measurement uncertainties, extinction coefficient. In one event the satellite algorithm misclassifies the aerosol layer as ice clouds {{as a result of the}} relatively high depolarization ratio (0. 06), likely caused by a high dust component in the aerosol mixture. Using 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies for these three events along with eight other export events observed by CALIOP in 2007 – 2009, we develop a meteorological index that captures 40 – 60 % of the variance of Asian transport events to the Arctic in winter and spring. Simulations with the GEOS-Chem model show that 6 major export events from Asia to the Arctic occur each year, on average. The maximum probability for such events is during March–June, with a secondary maximum in October–November. During these events, Asian pollution and dust aerosols account for 50 – 70 % of the aerosol optical depth over the Siberian sector of the Arctic, compared to a mean background contribution of 33 %...|$|R
40|$|Fulltext embargoed for: 12 months post date of publicationThe nucleus incertus (NI) {{of the rat}} {{hindbrain}} is a putative node in the ascending {{control of}} the septohippocampal system and hippocampal theta rhythm and is stress and arousal responsive. NI contains GABA neurons that express multiple neuropeptides, including relaxin- 3 (RLN 3) and neuropeptide receptors, including corticotrophin-releasing factor receptor- 1 (CRF-R 1), but the precise anatomical and physiological characteristics of NI neurons are unclear. Therefore, we examined the firing properties of NI neurons and their responses to CRF, the correlation of these responses with occurrence of relaxin- 3, and NI neuron morphology in the rat. Most NI neurons excited by intracerebroventricular CRF infusion were RLN 3 -positive (9 of 10), whereas all inhibited cells were RLN 3 -negative (8 of 8). The spontaneous firing of RLN 3 (n = 6) but not non-RLN 3 neurons (n = 6) was strongly modulated and phase-locked with the <b>initial</b> <b>ascending</b> phase of hippocampal theta oscillations. In brain slices, the majority of recorded NI neurons (15 of 19) displayed excitatory responses to CRF, which uniformly increased action potential frequency and membrane potential depolarization {{in the presence of}} tetrodotoxin, indicating a direct, postsynaptic action of CRF on NI neurons. This excitation was associated with reduction in the slow component of afterhyperpolarization and a strong depolarization. Quantitative analysis in naïve rats of validated CRF-R 1, RLN 3 and neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) immunoreactivity revealed 52 % of NI neurons as CRF-R 1 positive, of which 53 % were RLN 3 positive, while 48 % of NI neurons lacked CRF-R 1 and RLN 3. All RLN 3 neurons expressed CRF-R 1. CRF neurons that projected to the NI were identified in lateral preoptic hypothalamus, but not in paraventricular hypothalamus, bed nucleus of stria terminalis or central amygdala. Our findings suggest NI is an important site for CRF modulation of hippocampal theta rhythm via effects on GABA/RLN 3 transmission. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

Despite the {{association}} of numerous bacterial factors with uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), few such factors have been proved to be required for UTI in animal models. Previous investigations of urovirulence factors have relied on prior identification of phenotypic characteristics. We used signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM) in an unbiased effort to identify genes that are essential for UPEC survival within the murine urinary tract. A library of 2049 transposon mutants of the prototypic UPEC strain CFT 073 was constructed using mini-Tn 5 km 2 carrying 92 unique tags and screened in a murine model of <b>ascending</b> UTI. After <b>initial</b> screening followed by confirmation in co-infection experiments, 19 survival-defective mutants were identified. These mutants were recovered in numbers 101 - to 106 -fold less than the wild type in the bladder, kidneys or urine or at more than one site. The transposon junctions from each attenuated mutant were sequenced and analysed. Mutations were found in: (i) the type 1 fimbrial operon; (ii) genes involved in the biosyn-thesis of extracellular polysaccharides including group I capsule, group II capsule and enterobacterial common antigen; (iii) genes involved in metabolic pathways; and (iv) genes with unknown function. Five of the genes identified are absent from the genome of the E. coli K- 12 strain. Mutations in type 1 fimbrial genes resulted in severely attenuated colonization, even in the case of a mutant with an insertion upstream of the fim operon that affected the rate of fimbrial switching from the 'off' to the 'on' phase. Three mutants had insertions in a new type II capsule biosynthesis locus on a pathogenicity island and were impaired in the production of capsule in vivo. An additional mutant with an insertion in wecE was unable to synthesize enterobacterial common antigen. These results confirm the pre-eminence of type 1 fimbriae, establish the importance of extracellular polysaccharides in the pathogenesis of UTI and identify new urovirulence determinants...|$|R

Only {{one side of the}} abdominal vagal nerve trunk was cut and the opposite side was left untouched. The electron microscopic observations were performed on the ultrathin sections of tissues removed from {{the two sides of the}} abdominal vagal nerve trunk and the following results were obtained: 1) Changes in the distal stump of the cut nerve. Axonal swelling was seen from 12 hours to 3 days after the operation. In the swollen axons, accumulations of organella such as mitochondria, myelinfigures and vacuoles were observed. The axons were atrophied but Schwann cells were hypertrophied 4 days after the operation. Seven days after the operation, the axons had disappeared and only the Schwann cells remained. 2) Changes in the proximal stump of the cut nerve. An <b>initial</b> <b>ascending</b> degeneration of the axon was completed 4 days after the operation. The regenerating axons appeared 7 days after the operation. Generally, they were smaller in diameter (0. 3 - 0. 4 μ) than the normal (0. 6 - 1. 3 μ). Twenty-eight days after the operation, there were two relatively distinct types of axons; one of them of normal diameter (0. 6 - 1. 3 μ) and the other had a smaller diameter (0. 3 - 0. 5 μ). 3) Changes in the intact nerve. a) Two to seven days after the operation, smaller axons, 0. 2 - 0. 5 μ in diameter and contained microtubules, appeared intermingled with normal axons. In some parts of the unmyelinated fibers, bundles of small axons, each axon being about 0. 2 μ in diameter and not invaded by Schwann cell processes, were observed. Those bundles of axons were considered to be an early stage of nerve sprouting. b) Seven to twenty-eight days after the operation, in a longitudinal section, some axons appeared as composed of an alternate arrangement of wide and narrow areas. c) Twenty-eight days after the operation, an increase in the number of axons per Schwann cell unit was observed. It was assumed that this increase in axons was the result of nerve sprouting...|$|R
40|$|In {{reconstructive}} surgery, ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury of {{skeletal muscle}} tissue occurs during replantations, free vascularized transfers of muscle flaps and following composite tissue allograft (CTA) transplantations. The latter is a newly emerging field and involves the allotransplantation of complex composite tissues from deceased donors. Complete and partial failures of free vascularized muscle flaps and replantations remain a significant clinical problem. The more frequent application of CTAs requires {{the design of}} a preservation strategy that prevents I-R injury and allows tissue banking with maintenance of cellular function. Full recovery following I-R insults requires both skeletal muscle - and microvascular integrity. The hamster retractor muscle model (RET) is unique in that the muscle can be exteriorized while preserving its vascular supply, enabling in vivo muscle force production to be monitored concomitant with microvascular responses of the peripheral circulation. This model has provided novel insights into the regulation of skeletal muscle blood flow by “ascending vasodilation” (AVD) during contractile activity. AVD entails the <b>ascend</b> of the <b>initial</b> vasodilation of the intramuscular arteriolar networks to the proximally located “feed arteries”. These proximal vessels were shown to {{play a key role in}} the vasomotor control of skeletal muscle. The work described in this thesis reports the first in vivo evaluation of ascending vasodilation (AVD) and contractile muscle function following I-R. Both contractile muscle function and AVD of RET feed arteries in response to contractile activity are severely affected by a relatively short period of I-R (1 hour- 1 hour) at 37 C. The observed reduction in AVD is based upon attenuated initiation of vasodilation within the arteriolar network of the RET. Ca 2 + overload is the main cause for the observed derangement of contractile function at 37 C, whereas the formation of the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (OH?) is not a causative factor. Also, the deficit in initiation of AVD can not be attributed to the formation of OH?. As concluded from experiments performed at 21 C, reduction of metabolic turnover or decreased formation of other reactive oxygen species (ROS) than OH? contribute to the maintenance of skeletal muscle function and vasomotor control following I-R. In this thesis the RET was also used in the context of developing CTA preservation strategies. Following cold storage (16 hours at 4 C) of the isolated RET, formation of ROS turned out to be a major reason for loss in contractile muscle function, while Ca 2 + overload did not contribute to this dysfunction. The last chapter provides essential anatomical information concerning the RET and its vascular pedicle. It is demonstrated that the RET can be isolated on its thoracodorsal pedicle and can be used as a free flap model for future evaluation of the effect of preservation strategies and transplantation on skeletal muscle microcirculation and contractile function...|$|R
