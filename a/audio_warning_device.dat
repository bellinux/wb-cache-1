50|$|Many {{other aspects}} of the new line drew complaints. The {{frequent}} use of <b>audio</b> <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> by train operators caused friction between nearby residents and elected officials {{on the one hand and}} the SNCF on the other. This nuisance led to the creation of a collective of residents and local politicians who successfully reduced the volume of the audio devices by 15 dB in mid-March 2007. Safety policies have since changed and the devices’ use is now limited to when there is immediate danger.|$|R
40|$|Improving {{safety at}} railway level {{crossings}} is costly and as funds are often limited, {{it is important}} to search for cost-effective, evidence-based solutions. The effect that the many existing alternative systems have on driver behaviour is not always known. This paper compares driver behaviour towards two novel <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> (rumble strips and in-vehicle <b>audio</b> <b>warning)</b> at railway level crossings with two conventional <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> (flashing light and stop sign). Regression models were developed to reflect driver 2 ̆ 7 s responses towards the four different types of devices based on data collected from a driving simulation experiment. The regression models include a binary choice model for predicting the probability of a driver stopping or driving through a railway crossing, as well as mixed regression models for predicting the moment at which a driver will produce specific behavioural responses before stopping at a crossing (e. g. initiation of accelerator release and application of foot-pedal brake). Violation results indicated the active systems produced much higher levels of driver compliance than passive devices. Contributing factors, such as age, gender, speed and types of <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> were found significant at different approach stages to the level crossings. With the application of such behavioural models and traffic conflict techniques in microscopic simulation tools, traffic safety indicators, such as collision likelihood and time-to-collision can be estimated. From these, relative safety comparisons for the different traffic devices are derived...|$|R

5000|$|Compared {{with other}} types of <b>warning</b> <b>devices,</b> the {{effectiveness}} of the embedded pavement flashing light system seem to be high. When approaching a crosswalk with an embedded pavement flashing light system, drivers are more apt to slow down and yield to pedestrians than when drivers approach a crosswalk with another type of lighted <b>warning</b> <b>device.</b> Also, compared to a crosswalk with no <b>warning</b> <b>device,</b> drivers are more likely to slow down and yield to pedestrians when the embedded pavement flashing light system is in place.|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of safety technologies into complex socio-technical systems requires an integrated and {{holistic approach to}} HF and engineering, considering the effects of failures not only within system boundaries, but also at the interfaces with other systems and humans. Level crossing <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> are examples of such systems where technically safe states within the system boundary can influence road user performance, giving rise to other hazards that degrade safety of the system. Chris will discuss the challenges that have been encountered to date in developing a safety argument in support of low-cost level crossing <b>warning</b> <b>devices.</b> The design and failure modes of level crossing <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> {{are known to have}} a significant influence on road user performance; however, quantifying this effect is one of the ongoing challenges in determining appropriate reliability and availability targets for low-cost level crossing <b>warning</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the effect ICWSs on drivers’ behavior, in response to a potential conflict event at the intersections; in this case, a violator vehicle from right and left that failed to stop represented the potential conflict. The ICWSs were <b>audio</b> <b>warning</b> message and visual <b>warning.</b> Both the <b>audio</b> <b>warning</b> message and the visual warning provided to the driver the direction of the violator vehicle. Drivers’ reaction times were modeled following the survival analysis, by the use of the accelerated failure time (AFT) duration model with a Weibull distribution. The applied model identified one significant variable influencing the reaction time (Vi driver’s initial speed value) and the warning signal condition; the direction of the violator vehicle did not affect significantly the reaction time of drivers. For the condition of <b>audio</b> message <b>warning</b> and visual warning, the reaction time was 43. 1 % and 34. 5 % shorter than that for the baseline condition, respectively. In addition, the drivers’ reaction time for the <b>audio</b> message <b>warning</b> was 22 % shorter than that for the visual warning (statistically significant) ...|$|R

Major reasons for electrocution {{in the construction}} industries are workers contact with the power line or material handling equipment contact with the power line.
