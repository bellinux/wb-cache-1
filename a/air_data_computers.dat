The system employs thermally excited resonant silicon micro structural pressure sensor for the pressure measurement. Using miniature embedded computer, calculation of the parameters such as height, airspeed and mach number and real-time display by LCD are realized. The volume and weight of this system is only one-twelfth of the original. In addition, it has the characteristics of high accuracy, high resolution, high stability and repeatability. I．Instruction In the modern aircraft, <b>air</b> <b>data</b> system is used to measure flight parameters such as flight altitude, airspeed and M number. At present, <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>computer</b> often adopts vibrating cylinder pressure sensor to measure pressure. Due to measure two atmospheric parameters: total pressure and static pressure, internal configuration of <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>computer</b> is two vibrating cylinder pressure sensors. Therefore, volume and weight of <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>computer</b> depends on two vibrating cylinder pressure sensors. Bigger the volume is, greater the weight is. Such {{as a type of}} <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>computer,</b> length X width X high is 314 × 240 × 210 mm. Weight of <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>computer</b> (excluding shock absorber) is about 11 kg. However, if <b>air</b> <b>data</b> system adopts micro silicon resonant pressure sensor, the volume and the weight will be only 1 / 12 of the one of vibration cylinder pressure sensor and performance will be considerable. If electronic circuit and resonant pressure sensor is integrated, it will become the prototype of miniature <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>computer.</b> At the same time, development of airborne distributed <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>computer</b> become possible...|$|R

50|$|A Central <b>Air</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Computer</b> computes altitude, {{vertical}} speed, air speed, and {{mach number}} from sensor inputs such as pitot and static pressure and temperature. Early CADC systems were electromechanical computers, {{such as in}} the F-111. From 1968 to 1970, the first digital CADC was developed for the F-14. In the 1980s, the Standard Central <b>Air</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Computer</b> was developed to retrofit U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy aircraft.|$|R

5000|$|An air data boom {{provides}} air pressure, temperature, and airflow direction data to {{data acquisition}} and <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>computers</b> for the computation of aircraft orientation, airspeed, altitude, and related information.

50|$|Label {{guidelines}} are provided {{as part of}} the ARINC 429 specification, for various equipment types. Each aircraft will contain a number of different systems, such as flight management computers, inertial reference systems, <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>computers,</b> radar altimeters, radios, and GPS sensors. For each type of equipment, a set of standard parameters is defined, which is common across all manufacturers and models. For example, any air data computer will provide the barometric altitude of the aircraft as label 203. This allows some degree of interchangeability of parts, as all <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>computers</b> behave, for the most part, in the same way. There are {{only a limited number of}} labels, though, and so label 203 may have some completely different meaning if sent by a GPS sensor, for example. Very commonly needed aircraft parameters, however, use the same label regardless of source. Also, as with any specification, each manufacturer has slight differences from the formal specification, such as by providing extra data above and beyond the specification, leaving out some data recommended by the specification, or other various changes.|$|E

50|$|In aerospace, the {{mechanical}} stand-alone altimeters {{which are based}} on diaphragm bellows were replaced by integrated measurement systems which are called <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>computers</b> (ADC).

Multiple altimeters can be used to design a pressure reference system to provide information about the airplane's position angles to further support inertial navigation system calculations.|$|E
50|$|In 1958 the {{standard}} vertical separation {{was set to}} 1,000 feet from the surface to FL290, and 2,000 feet above FL290.
