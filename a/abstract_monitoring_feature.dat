40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> <b>Monitoring</b> the {{empirical}} Shannon entropy of a feature {{in a network}} packet stream has previously {{been shown to be}} useful in detecting anomalies in the network traffic. Entropy is an information-theoretic statistic that measures the variability of the feature under consideration. Anomalous activity in network traffic can be captured by detecting changes in this variability. There are several challenges, however, in monitoring this statistic. Computing the statistic efficiently is non-trivial. Further, when <b>monitoring</b> multiple <b>features,</b> the streaming algorithms proposed previously would likely fail {{to keep up with the}} ever-increasing channel bandwidth of network traffic streams. There is also the concern that an adversary could attempt to mask the effect of his attacks on variability by a mimicry attack disguising his traffic to mimic the distribution of normal traffic in the network, thus avoiding detection by an entropy monitoring sensor. Also, the high rate of false positives is a big problem with Intrusio...|$|R

40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> <b>Monitoring</b> {{business}} processes during their execution is one {{important aspect of}} business process management. Process monitoring requires observed events, which are recorded in information systems, to reason about, amongst others, process progress. Especially in manual executing process environments, the observed events are most likely sparse. Therefore, we introduce an approach {{increasing the number of}} observed events by capturing data state transition events, which occur after successfully writing a data object during process execution. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Abstract</b> <b>Monitoring</b> {{requires}} {{to gather}} data about executions. The monitoring functionalities currently available are built on top of ad hoc instrumentations. Most of them are implemented at low-level; in any case they require an indepth knowledge of the system to instrument. The best people to implement these instrumentations are generally the implementors of the compiler. They, however, cannot decide which data to gather. Indeed, hundreds of variants can be useful and only end-users know what they want...|$|R
