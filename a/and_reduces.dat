5|$|Aluminium {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminium billets {{in a process}} which first presses the walls and base, then trims {{the top edge of}} the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck. The final structural process is machining the neck outer surface, boring and cutting the neck threads and O-ring groove. The cylinder is then heat-treated, tested and stamped with the required permanent markings. Aluminium diving cylinders commonly have flat bases, which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces, and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear. This makes them heavier than they need to be for strength, but the extra weight at the base also helps keep the centre of gravity low which gives better balance in the water <b>and</b> <b>reduces</b> excess buoyancy.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{probe the}} effects of {{acupuncture}} reinforcing <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> methods on the human body. MethodsStudied acupuncture reinforcing <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> actions in the ancient literature, based on modern clinical and experimental studies, in combination with experience of acupuncture teaching and clinical treatment. ResultsThe key to the generation of reinforcing <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> actions is not the acupuncture reinforcing <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> methods themselves, but instead the functional state of the patient during the acupuncture. When reinforcing <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> methods act on the human body, a reinforcing-reducing effect is produced through regulation of Qi, indicating that {{the production of the}} reinforcing-reducing effect requires a certain condition. Specifically, acupuncture does not produce the reinforcing-reducing effect under all conditions, but can produce a reinforcing effect in patients with deficiency syndrome <b>and</b> a <b>reducing</b> effect in patients with excess syndrome. ConclusionReinforcing <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> methods each have therapeutic effects on both deficiency syndrome and excess syndrome, but a reinforcing method should be selected first for deficiency syndrome <b>and</b> a <b>reducing</b> method should be selected first for excess syndrome...|$|R
5|$|Febuxostat is {{typically}} only recommended {{in those who}} cannot tolerate allopurinol. Probenecid appears to be less effective than allopurinol and is a second line agent. Probenecid may be used if undersecretion of uric acid is present (24-hour urine uric acid less than 800mg). It is, however, not recommended if a person {{has a history of}} kidney stones. Pegloticase is an option for the 3% of people who are intolerant to other medications. It is a third line agent. Pegloticase is administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks, <b>and</b> <b>reduces</b> uric acid levels. Pegloticase is useful decreasing tophi but has a high rate of side effects and many people develop resistance to it. In 2016 it was withdrawn from the European market.|$|E
5|$|Folding@home {{can use the}} {{parallel}} computing abilities of modern multi-core processors. The ability to use several CPU cores simultaneously allows completing the full simulation far faster. Working together, these CPU cores complete single work units proportionately faster than the standard uniprocessor client. This method is scientifically valuable because it enables much longer simulation trajectories to be performed in {{the same amount of}} time, <b>and</b> <b>reduces</b> the traditional difficulties of scaling a large simulation to many separate processors. A 2007 publication in the Journal of Molecular Biology relied on multi-core processing to simulate the folding of part of the villin protein approximately 10 times longer than was possible with a single-processor client, in agreement with experimental folding rates.|$|E
5|$|Munitions and {{ammunition}} handling is accomplished using a Babcock designed highly mechanised weapons handling system (HMWHS). This {{is a first}} naval application of a common land-based warehouse system. The HMWHS moves palletised munitions from the magazines and weapon preparation areas, along track ways and via several lifts, forward and aft or port and starboard. The tracks can carry a pallet to magazines, the hangar, weapons preparation areas, and the flight deck. In a change from normal procedures the magazines are unmanned, the movement of pallets is controlled from a central location, and manpower is only required when munitions are being initially stored or prepared for use. This system speeds up delivery <b>and</b> <b>reduces</b> {{the size of the}} crew by automation.|$|E

5|$|Succinate-Q oxidoreductase, {{also known}} as complex II or succinate dehydrogenase, is a second entry point to the {{electron}} transport chain. It is unusual {{because it is the}} only enzyme that is part of both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Complex II consists of four protein subunits and contains a bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, iron–sulfur clusters, and a heme group that does not participate in electron transfer to coenzyme Q, but is believed to be important in decreasing production of reactive oxygen species. It oxidizes succinate to fumarate <b>and</b> <b>reduces</b> ubiquinone. As this reaction releases less energy than the oxidation of NADH, complex II does not transport protons across the membrane and does not contribute to the proton gradient.|$|E

5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} is a {{medium-sized}} rodent that looks {{much like the}} common black and brown rats, but has greater differences in color between the upper- and underparts. The fur is thick and short. The upperparts are generally gray to grayish brown, with the head a bit lighter, and are sharply delimited from the underparts, which are off-white, as are the feet. It has small cheek pouches. The ears {{are about the same}} color as the upperparts, but a patch of light hairs is in front of them. The tail is dark brown above and may be paler below. The guard hairs are long and have unpigmented, silvery tips. When rice rats swim, air is trapped in the fur, which increases buoyancy <b>and</b> <b>reduces</b> heat loss. As in most other oryzomyines, females have eight mammae.|$|E

5|$|Thermal mass is any {{material}} {{that can be}} used to store heat—heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy. Common thermal mass materials include stone, cement and water. Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night. However, they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting and shading conditions. When properly incorporated, thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range <b>and</b> <b>reduces</b> the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 118Category4 hurricanes have been {{recorded}} in the eastern and central Pacific basins since 1900. Only two Category4 hurricanes {{have been recorded}} in May, in addition to 12in June, 22in July, 29in August, 32in September, 18in October, and two in November. No Category4 storms have developed during the off-season.

It was estimated that if sea-surface temperatures ascended by 2 to 2.5degrees, the intensity of tropical cyclones would increase by 6–10% internationally. During years with {{the existence of an}} El Niño, sea-surface temperatures increase in the eastern Pacific, resulting in an increase in activity as vertical wind shear decreases in the Pacific; the opposite happens in the Atlantic basin during El Niño, when wind shear increases creating an unfavourable environment for tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic. Contrary to El Niño, La Niña increases wind shear over the eastern Pacific <b>and</b> <b>reduces</b> it over the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Essence is {{used for}} both {{creating}} creatures and casting spells; the number, type and strength of creations {{is limited by the}} player's essence capacity. For instance, if a character with 70 maximum essence summons a creature which costs 20 essence, their maximum essence is reduced to 50 until the creation is destroyed, either through combat or being absorbed by the Shaper to regain essence. A total of 18 different creations are featured in the game, with larger and more powerful creatures costing more essence to create. The types and strengths of creations can be altered depending on the player's combat style. Creations accompanying the player receive a percentage of the experience points received for completing quests or defeating foes, levelling up and receiving skill points {{in the same manner as}} the player character. These skill points can be spent to increase creations' statistics, but every statistic increase costs more essence <b>and</b> <b>reduces</b> the amount of essence available to summon other creations or cast spells. Essence and health are regained from Shaper-designed pools or by entering a friendly town.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A new {{mechanism}} of saving energy <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> pollution is brought forward by analyzing water characters in high temperature condition and all factors which bring saving energy <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> {{pollution in the}} combustion process of emulsification oil. The theory shows that the reason of saving energy <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> pollution is that emulsification oil can reduce surplus air ratio effectively in the combustion process. These reasons include that of improving the burning flame temperature, avoiding the local super-high temperature, decreasing the amount of NOX and the conversion of SO 2 oxidize to SO 3, strengthening the burning and heat transmission <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> the soot of the flue gas. By this new theory, the reasons of saving energy <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> pollution in the combustion process of emulsification gasoline, emulsification diesel oil, emulsification heavy oil and other slurry fuel of W/O or O/W can be well explained. At the same time, the new mechanism was well validated in the combustion process of hard asphalt water slurry...|$|R
