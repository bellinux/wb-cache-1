25|$|The high {{dropout rate}} {{is among the}} biggest {{obstacles}} to higher education for both Bedouin men <b>and</b> <b>women.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> students that do remain in school, only about 30% pass their matriculation exams. These exams are taken {{at the end of}} high school (typically around age 17) and are required for enrollment at Israeli universities. Moreover, Bedouin students studying at Israeli universities face a significant language barrier (instruction is generally in Hebrew or English, not Arabic). Finally, most Negev Bedouin men are employed as wage laborers, not as white-collar or blue-collar workers. In the face of this fact, it often does not seem a reasonable investment to attain higher education.|$|E
