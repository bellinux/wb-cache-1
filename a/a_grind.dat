5|$|Like its {{predecessors}} in the Tony Hawk's series, Underground {{is centered on}} skateboarding {{in a series of}} levels. The player performs tricks via combinations of analog stick and button inputs. For example, the player initiates an ollie (a jump trick) by holding and releasing the jump button. During an ollie, the player may change the position of the analog stick and press one of two buttons to perform either a flip trick (such as an impossible or kickflip) or a grab trick (such as a benihana or nosegrab). The player can grind on certain edges and rails; different tricks may be performed during <b>a</b> <b>grind</b> based on the position of the analog stick. On quarter pipes, the player may execute lip tricks. While skating on flat surfaces, the player may manual in multiple ways via button combinations. Miscellaneous tricks include acid drops and wall-rides.|$|E
5|$|While <b>a</b> <b>grind,</b> lip, or manual {{trick is}} underway, a balance meter appears: unless the player {{prevents}} this meter from {{falling to the}} left or right, the character will bail and need a few seconds to recover. Bailing can also be caused by falling without one's board facing downward. Completing tricks in succession without bailing is called a combo. Comboing raises the player's score and fills up the Special Meter; when it is full, the player is granted access to more elaborate tricks worth more points, such as the McTwist and 540 Flip. Underground introduces the ability to dismount one's skateboard, which allows the player to explore levels more carefully and reach new areas. Each level features at least one vehicle, usually a car, that the player can drive.|$|E

[...] Many European fans saw the split as an attempt to increase profits by forcing audiences to pay twice for what was shown as a single film in the United States.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> worn <b>grinding</b> wheel can {{be dressed}} to restore its <b>grinding</b> properties.

500|$|The {{design and}} layout of the island in The Witness has been nearly {{consistent}} {{since the start of}} the game's development, with the team working on populating the world with specific puzzles, and detailing the landscape and other art assets. Sam Machkovech, a writer for Ars Technica that had played a demo of the game in 2012 and again in 2015, noted that the island had remained familiar between these two sessions. One aspect of the design of the game world is the use of power cables running across the island, connecting puzzle panels to the mechanics they control. Blow found these to help in the initial parts of the game to provide [...] "extreme clarity" [...] of where the player was to go next, but discovered that this also made the game too much of <b>a</b> <b>grind</b> of repeating the same pattern. Over the course of development, the power cable aspects were still kept, but the designers changed up how easy they were to trace across the landscape as a means to guide the player towards potential objectives.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{found the}} {{campaign}} poorly executed. Edge called it [...] "nonsense", and Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer {{said it was}} [...] "as clichéd as it is shallow". IGN McCaffrey wrote that the story became [...] "background noise" [...] in an otherwise chaotic game. Writing for The Verge, Adi Robertson compared the plot to the backstory on 1990s CD-ROM user manuals, and OXM Mikel Reparaz felt his actions were unimportant to the narrative. Ars Technica Peter Bright called the campaign's voice acting [...] "some of the worst ... ever heard—flat and uninspired". Reviewers noted how the game borrowed from games in other genres, such as DOTA and League of Legends. McCaffrey of IGN considered the AI soldiers both a valuable game mechanic and [...] "worthless fodder" [...] at once. Edge called Titanfall [...] "a game of time management", spent planning when timers will deplete and activate powers. Peter Bright of Ars Technica wrote {{that the nature of}} the Titan timers turned every mode into a deathmatch, regardless of objective. IGN McCaffrey referred to the experience point [...] "grind" [...] and the Titanfall timer as the game's [...] "two economies". He also praised Respawn for not using microtransactions with the game, especially with burn cards. Writing for Edge, Neil Long compared burn cards to FIFA Ultimate Team's power-ups. Whitehead of Eurogamer wrote that the game begins to drag after level 25 and slows into <b>a</b> <b>grind,</b> though its flow overall is effortlessly cool, like a [...] "first-person Crackdown".|$|E

Rich Lopez of the Dallas Voice cited the song as {{being one of the}} [...] "better" [...] songs of Love? and was surprised it had [...] "yet to be released as a single".

[...] Emily Exton of Popdust agreed, adding that [...] "you'd be silly not to think" [...] that the song's chorus will become a dance-floor chant among [...] "slightly intoxicated females (and males) in bars across America this summer".

2500|$|Exterior scenes for {{the first}} two seasons were shot almost {{exclusively}} in Stevenson Ranch, a suburban area of Santa Clarita Valley, California. The large fountain and Agrestic sign in the opening credits of the first three seasons was shot at the corner of Stevenson Ranch Parkway and Holmes Place. The name [...] "Stevenson Ranch" [...] was digitally replaced with [...] "Agrestic" [...] (and with [...] "Majestic" [...] and [...] "Regrestic" [...] in later episodes).
