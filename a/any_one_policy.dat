Moreover, transport industries were very much {{at the forefront of}} the Thatcher revolution in industrial ownership and organisation. This paper firstly defines what is meant by privatization. Secondly, it assesses the economic reasons for privatization. Thirdly, it outlines the main privatizations that have occurred in the British transport market and assesses their impact. Fourthly, the applicability of the British experiment to other countries, particularly in the developing world, is considered. It is concluded that a necessary pre-requisite to privatization is commercialisation and as a result emphasis in many developing countries will be on reforming public enterprise rather than on out and out privatization...|$|E
40|$|Performance {{isolation}} and high utilization are two key requirements when sharing resources, such as network bandwidth, between tenants {{in a public}} or private cloud. Recent network sharing proposals enforce a particular policy, such as per (source-VM, destination-VM) band-width allocations, by explicitly enforcing rate limits be-tween pairs of communicating VMs. We show that no single bandwidth allocation policy can capture different tenant goals, and <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>policy</b> can hurt tenant perfor-mance. Hence, we argue that the cloud provider should provide complete freedom to tenants to decide flow-level rate allocations, and enforce isolation through endpoint (VM) rate limits instead. However, enforcing isolation through static endpoint rate limits can waste bandwidth. To capture these diverse goals of tenants and the provider, we develop a game theoretic model of their in-teraction. We present a procedure by which a provider can compute an allocation that achieves both {{isolation and}} high utilization without explicit information about the tenants ’ goals, simply by observing tenants ’ usage of their allocated bandwidth. 1...|$|E

Next it gives one illustrative example showing how much damage {{can be caused by}} following Ng 2 ̆ 7 s advice. It then argues that when Ng 2 ̆ 7 s key assumption is replaced by one that is closer to the facts, there is no general a priori presumption for adopting any specific policy, including maintaining the status quo.

Although parties know the distribution of citizen traits (preferences and endowments), they are uncertain about the distribution of traits among the citizens who will turn up at the polls. This uncertainty engenders an endogenously derived function (t 1, t 2) giving the probability that <b>any</b> <b>one</b> tax <b>policy</b> t 1 will defeat another t 2 in the election.

It is not concerned with {{a detailed analysis of}} <b>any</b> <b>one</b> particular <b>policy</b> but instead looks at whether housing reform is likely to contribute successfully to its own high level goals, which are identified as social justice, social cohesion, economic competitiveness and the empowerment of citizens and communities. It proceeds by examining those goals and the context for their development, and examining how they have been pursued, mainly through legislative change but also by administrative reform and financial inducement. The paper contends that in respect of some goals, especially achieving greater social justice, the reforms are likely to make considerable inroads. However, it also notes that the goals open up areas of conflict that are not fully acknowledged and are not resolved by the reforms...|$|R
40|$|Investments by Asian Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) {{continue}} to be of concern in the global economy. A common perception {{is that they are}} managed by state-affiliated entities with geostrategic motives that could somehow prove detrimental to host countries. This paper demonstrates, however, that even the definition, let alone the establishment and investment targets, of Asian SWFs are embroiled in ambiguity within home country politics. Plainly put, ambiguity refers to the absence of clear-cut policy processes, means, and goals. How do we explain the ambiguity surrounding SWFs? Ambiguity is not a cover for deliberate, cohesive, and strategic actions, because SWFs are not under the control of <b>any</b> <b>one</b> set of actors. Rather, perhaps to the discomfort even of home country sovereigns, ambiguity is a messy domestic product of contending political forces that do not allow a marked trend toward <b>any</b> <b>one</b> single <b>policy</b> equilibrium on sovereign investments, whether domestic or foreign. While this reality is perhaps understandable in a democratic polity, it is also equally true of authoritarian ones in the region. In both types of cases, ambiguity is constructed inadvertently by the interactions of state, interstate, and intrastate actors, each with their own interests and expectations about the role of SWFs. Analyzing the cases in Singapore, China, Japan, and other Asian countries, from this unifying perspective suggests that while ambiguity may fuel external anxiety concerning home country intentions, it actually reflects far more domestically salient controversies about SWF activities than is typically appreciated. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical and numerical {{comparison of the}} welfare impacts of alternative instruments for environmental protection {{in the presence of}} endogenous technological innovation. We analyze emissions taxes and both auctioned and free (grandfathered) emissions permits. We find that under different sets of circumstances each of the three policies may induce a significantly higher welfare gain than the other two policies. In particular, the relative ranking of policy instruments can crucially depend on the ability of adopting firms to imitate the innovation, the costs of innovation, the slope and level of the marginal environmental benefit function, and the number of firms producing emissions. Moreover, although in theory the welfare impacts of policies differ in the presence of innovation, sometimes these differences are relatively small. In fact, when firms anticipate that policies will be adjusted over time in response to innovation, certain policies can become equivalent. Our analysis is simplified in a number of respects; for example, we assume homogeneous and competitive firms. Nonetheless, our preliminary results suggest there is no clear-cut case for preferring <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>policy</b> instrument on the grounds of dynamic efficiency. ...|$|E

6000|$|This is {{something}} that altogether transcends any partisan politics. It is of comparatively little consequence to us whether Congress or the President carry the day, provided only that America triumph. That is, after all, the real question. On which side {{is the future of}} the country,--the future that we cannot escape if we would, but which our action may embarrass and retard? If we had looked upon the war as a mere trial of physical strength between two rival sections of the country, we should have been the first to oppose it, as a wicked waste of treasure and blood. But it was something much deeper than this, and so the people of the North instinctively recognized it to be from the first,--instinctively, we say, and not deliberately at first; but before it was over, their understandings had grasped its true meaning, as an effort of the ideal America, which was to them half a dream and half a reality, to cast off an alien element. It was this ideal something, not the less strongly felt because vaguely defined, that made them eager, as only what is above sordid motives can, to sacrifice all that they had and all that they were rather than fail in its attainment. And it is to men not yet cooled from the white-heat of this passionate mood that Mr. Johnson comes with his paltry offer of [...] "my policy," [...] in exchange for the logical consequences of all this devotion and this sacrifice. What is <b>any</b> <b>one</b> man's <b>policy,</b> and especially <b>any</b> <b>one</b> weak man's <b>policy,</b> against the settled drift of a nation's conviction, conscience, and instinct? The American people had made up not only their minds, but their hearts, and no man who knows anything of human nature could doubt what their decision would be. They wanted only a sufficient obstacle to awaken them to a full consciousness of what was at stake, and that obstacle the obstinate vanity of the President and the blindness or resentment of his prime minister have supplied. They are fully resolved to have the great stake they played for and won, and that stake was the Americanization of all America, nothing more and nothing less. Mr. Johnson told us in New York, with so profound a misconception of the feeling of the Northern States as was only possible to a vulgar mind, and that mind a Southern one, that the South had set up slavery as its stake, and lost, and that now the North was in danger of losing the stake it had risked on reconstruction in the national debt. Mr. Johnson is still, it would seem, under that delusion which led the South into the war; namely, that it was that section of the country which was the chief element in its wealth and greatness. But no Northern man, who, so long as he lives, will be obliged to pay his fine of taxes for the abolition of slavery which was forced upon us by the South, is likely to think it very hard that the South should be compelled to furnish its share toward the common burden, or will be afraid that the loyal States, whose urgent demands compelled a timid Congress at last to impose direct taxes, will be unable to meet their obligations in the future, as in the past.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to present a {{decision}} support and planning tool for large, multi-facility, multi-modal, multi-stakeholder, and multi-criteria systems. The model, named Multiple Attribute Decision System (MADS), is composed of two modules [...] an evaluation module and a policy development module. In addition to using customary model making tools, a genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to create alternative system designs in the development module. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} instance of applying a GA to the development of alternative courses of action in the planning field. Using the GA for such an application expands the decision making process into one of planning. ^ In addition, it is asserted that the novel use of the GA methodology introduced in this thesis extends the capabilities of models that evaluate the performance and consequences of existing systems to include for planning for the future of those systems. The claim that the model constructed for this thesis is a planning model implies that it can address problems for which neither the physical configuration nor the operational organization of the system is fixed at the planning stage of decision making. In such a situation, a planner must find an approach that enables her to fix on a particular satisfying design. The GA is implemented to provide an analytical technique for constructing such designs. The planning tool that emerges from this work can be used by decision-makers to evaluate tradeoffs of policy alternatives prior to implementation of <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>policy.</b> ^ The emphasis in this research is on the methodology. However, sufficient information is presented for a particular case study to exhibit the utility of the proposed methodology {{in the context of a}} specific application. A solid waste management system is used as a case study, and it is shown that the model is applicable to all systems that satisfy the general properties that a solid waste management system has [...] even though those other systems may not be waste related entities. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{designed}} to highlight the impact of policy drivers on the freight logistics supply chain. This section will define the term policy drivers and outline {{the different types of}} impacts the can have upon the logistics supply chain. In Section Two a list of policy drivers is presented, along with associated policy levers. An attempt to assess what impact each policy lever has on the logistics supply chain is made in Section Three and in Section Four a number of policies levers are selected to take forward as possible scenarios to be evaluated in the University of Leeds cost modelling work. Policy drivers are defined as broad aims, targets or statements that are considered to be desirable by the various bodies of government or non-government organisations in satisfying their overall goals such as “maximising social welfare”, “staying in power” etc [...] . The types of policy drivers vary by organisation and may be complimentary or contradictory. They may also change over time as new doctrine is implemented or new research findings put into practise. In the Government’s, ‘Transport 2010 - The 10 Year Plan’ (DFT, 2000) the policy drivers are outlined under the heading ‘Vision’ and are presented below, · Fully integrated public transport information, booking and ticketing systems; · Safer and more secure transport accessible to all; and, · A transport system that makes less impact on the environment. Policy levers are the policy instruments used to attain policy drivers and can be used to achieve more than one Both policy drivers and policy levers can be categorised under two headings as outlined below, a) Fiscal Drivers; and, b) Physical & Regulatory Drivers The implementation of these policies leads to both direct and indirect outcomes that will make some contribution to achieving the policy drivers set out by the government. The policy levers will impact upon the freight industry in a positive, negative or neutral manner and {{for the purposes of the}} next section three definitions have been formulated which have been related to the impact of policy levers on costs and externalities. In Section Four a broader range of impacts are discussed for the policy levers that have been selected as possible scenarios. A Positive Impact - Any outcome that, 1) Lowers operating cost without increasing externalities, and/or; 2) Lowers externalities without increasing costs. A Neutral lmpact – Any outcome that, 1) Maintains defacto operating costs without changing externalities, and/or; 2) Maintains defacto externalities with out changing operating costs. A Negative Impact – Any outcome that, 5 1) Increases operating costs, and/or; 2) Increases externalities. Making a judgement as to whether <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>policy</b> is beneficial or not is difficult in the absence of any data and will differ depending upon who you are. The judgements that will be made in this paper will apply to the freight logistics industry only and the externalities they produce. It is stressed that they are not exact. The next section will outline in more detail some of the possible policy drivers that either currently apply to or could be applied to the freight logistics industry. The likely policy levers that could arise from the policy drivers are then discussed along with the possible transport outcomes and their impact...|$|E
40|$|High {{commodity}} prices have {{increased interest in}} the impacts of federal ethanol policies. We present a stochastic, short-run structural model of U. S. corn, ethanol, and gasoline markets to estimate the price and welfare impacts of alternative policies on producers and consumers of corn, ethanol, and gasoline. The three federal policies that we consider are the Renewable Fuels Standard, the blenders tax credit, and the tariff on imported ethanol. Our model examines {{the impact of these}} policies on prices during the 2008 / 09 marketing year. Our results show that in the short run, a change in U. S. ethanol policies would not have a large, immediate impact on corn prices. Eliminating <b>any</b> <b>one</b> of the <b>policies</b> would reduce average corn prices by less than 4 %. Removal of all three programs would decrease average corn prices by 14. 5 %. The reason why the changes are relatively modest is that existing U. S. ethanol plants will only shut down if their variable cost of production is not covered. Changes in ethanol policies would have large distributional impacts. Corn growers, ethanol producers, and fuel consumers have a large incentive to maintain high ethanol consumption. Gasoline producers have a large incentive to reduce ethanol production and imports. Livestock producers have a large short-run incentive to reduce domestic ethanol production. ethanol policy, stochastic equilibrium model, welfare analysis. ...|$|R
