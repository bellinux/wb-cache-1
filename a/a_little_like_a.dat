And he always knew that subconsciously the only person who'd {{be able to give}} him a second look is someone who's not willing to take the first look for granted." [...] On her side, Jorja Fox {{has said that}} [...] "The story of Sara and Grissom is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fable.

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B, praising the cinematic {{quality of the}} first two segments while concluding that the third was the poorest. He was impressed by how the Kubrick references in the second segment used originality rather than being a [...] "perfunctory checklist", and how the director's [...] "ow" [...] at the end had [...] "comic aplomb". Writing for the New York Daily News, Don Kaplan gave the episode four stars out of five, singling the third segment out as the best, and deeming the Kubrick homage [...] "smart and silly". A more mixed review came from Alex Strachan on Postmedia News' Canada.com, who found the second segment to be the best and the other two to be average, although he admitted that the Kubrick references were [...] "occasionally a little too inside or self-indulgent for their own good". He concluded that [...] "there’s something in Treehouse of Horror XXV for everyone. <b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Halloween bag of candy".|$|E
2500|$|All pizmonim can be {{classified}} under different maqams (musical modes), {{of which there are}} about ten in common use. Maqam ajam, which sounds <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Western major scale, is the thematic maqam that contains many holiday melodies. Maqam hijaz, which corresponds to the Phrygian dominant scale, is the thematic maqam that contains many sad melodies. [...] Maqam sikah (or sigah), containing many three-quarter-tone intervals, is used for the cantillation of the Torah. Maqam saba is the maqam used for circumcisions.|$|E

6000|$|In late Latin it {{is called}} 'petiolus,' the little foot; because the {{expanding}} piece that holds the grape, or olive, is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> animal's foot. Modern botanists have misapplied the word to the leaf-stalk, which has no resemblance to a foot at all. We must keep the word to its proper meaning, and, when we want to write Latin, call it 'petiolus;' when we want to write English, call it 'stalk,' meaning always fruit or flower stalk. {131} ...|$|R
