5|$|It is {{possible}} {{to look through the}} history of biology from the ancient Greeks onwards and discover anticipations of almost all of Charles Darwin's key ideas. For example, Loren Eiseley has found isolated passages written by Buffon suggesting he was <b>almost</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> piece together a theory of natural selection, but states that such anticipations should not be taken out of the full context of the writings or of cultural values of the time which made Darwinian ideas of evolution unthinkable.|$|E
5|$|In May 1941 the VuWHA {{founded the}} Deutsche Ausrüstungswerke GmbH (German Equipment Works; DAW), {{which was created}} to {{integrate}} the SS business enterprises with the burgeoning concentration camp system. Himmler subsequently established four major new concentration camps in 1941: Auschwitz, Gross-Rosen, Natzweiler-Struthof, and Neuengamme. Each {{had at least one}} factory or quarry nearby where the inmates were forced to work. Himmler took a particular interest in providing laborers for IG Farben, which was constructing a synthetic rubber factory at Auschwitz III–Monowitz. The plant was <b>almost</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> commence production when it was overrun by Soviet troops in 1945. Life expectancy of inmates at Monowitz averaged about three months. This was typical of the camps, as inmates were underfed and lived under disastrously bad living conditions. Their workload was intentionally made impossibly high, under the policy of extermination through labor.|$|E

5|$|Miličević {{began playing}} in bands around Troy {{in the late}} 1990s. He co-founded the group Morphic with some friends in 2000. The band first {{operated}} under the name Loki, before settling on its final name. By 2001, the group performed gigs at small Michigan venues and clubs, and recorded a number of demo tracks. The following year, Miličević left the band and was <b>almost</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> quit his musical career. However, during this period, manager Arthur Spivak, who had previously met Miličević at a showcase concert with Morphic, told him about an audition for Thirty Seconds to Mars. Miličević then {{decided to move to}} Los Angeles where he had a successful audition with Thirty Seconds to Mars, replacing guitarist Solon Bixler. By 2003, the band consisted of Miličević, lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Jared Leto, drummer Shannon Leto, and bassist Matt Wachter. The new line-up debuted on The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn in February 2003.|$|E
5|$|At first, the laborers {{walked the}} seven {{kilometers}} from Auschwitz I {{to the plant}} each day, but as this meant they had to rise at 03:00, many arrived exhausted and unable to work. The camp at Monowitz (also called Monowitz-Buna or Auschwitz III) was constructed and began housing inmates on 30 October 1942, the first concentration camp to be financed and built by private industry. In January 1943 the ArbeitsausbildungLager (labor education camp) was moved from the parent camp to Monowitz. These prisoners were also forced {{to work on the}} building site. The SS charged IG Farben three Reichsmarks per hour for unskilled workers, four for skilled workers. Although the camp administrators expected the prisoners to work at 75 percent of the capacity of a free worker, the inmates were only able to perform 20 to 50 percent as well. Site managers constantly threatened inmates with transportation to Birkenau for death in the gas chambers as a way to try to increase productivity. Deaths and transfers to the gas chambers at Birkenau reduced the prisoner population of Monowitz by nearly a fifth each month; numbers were made up with new arrivals. Life expectancy of inmates at Monowitz averaged about three months. Though the factory had been expected to begin production in 1943, shortages of labor and raw materials meant start-up had to be postponed repeatedly. The plant was <b>almost</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> commence production when it was overrun by Soviet troops in 1945.|$|E

Retention of eggs and live birth are most often associated with colder environments.|$|E

25|$|Bennington was {{frustrated}} and <b>almost</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> quit his musical career altogether when Jeff Blue, {{the vice president}} of A at Zomba Music in Los Angeles, offered him an audition with the future members of Linkin Park.

He managed to record the song for his audition in a day, missing his own birthday celebration in the process. Bennington and Mike Shinoda, the band's other vocalist, made significant progress together, but failed to find a record deal. After facing numerous rejections, Jeff Blue, now a vice president of A at Warner Bros., intervened again to help the band sign with Warner Bros. Records.|$|E

Her continual disagreements with her mother, her rash squabbles with Tom and Charles, and petulance with Betsey, were at least so distressing to Fanny that, though admitting they were by no means without provocation, she feared the disposition that could push them to such length must be far from amiable, and from affording any repose to herself.|$|R

No difficulty was made on Mrs. Allen's side, and the only difficulty on Catherine's was in concealing the excess of her pleasure.|$|R

[...] On July 20, with some transports <b>almost</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> sail, new orders arrived that countermanded the previous ones. [...] In {{the most direct}} terms, Clinton ordered him to establish a fortified deep-water port, using as much of his army as he thought necessary. Clinton took this decision because the navy had long been dissatisfied with New York as a naval base, firstly because sand bars obstructed {{the entrance to the}} Hudson River, damaging the hulls of the larger ships; and secondly because the river often froze in winter, imprisoning vessels inside the harbour. [...] Arbuthnot had recently been replaced and to show his satisfaction at this development, Clinton now acceded to the Navy's request, despite Cornwallis's warning that the Chesapeake's open bays and navigable rivers meant that any base there [...] "will always be exposed to sudden French attack." [...] It was to prove a fatal error of judgement by Clinton, since the need to defend the new facility denied Cornwallis any freedom of movement [...] Nevertheless, having inspected Portsmouth and found it less favourable than Yorktown, Cornwallis wrote to Clinton informing him that he would fortify Yorktown.|$|E

5000|$|The {{enthusiastic}} Tatra designers, however, {{continued their}} work on a new car in secret. In 1952 a group of designers led by František Kardaus and Vladimír Popelář started secret {{development of a new}} car called Valuta, while officially devoting their time to development of a new three-axle bus T400. In 1953 the communist government got fed up with delays in delivery of Soviet cars as well as with their poor qualityand they ordered development of a new luxury Tatra, thus giving legitimacy to the team's previous work. The new car was to have a 3.5-litre air-cooled eight-cylinder engine, and it was <b>to</b> be <b>ready</b> for production by the end of 1954. While the chassis was <b>almost</b> <b>ready</b> due <b>to</b> the work on Valuta, the engine remained an issue. Even in their secret designs nobody had anticipated such a large engine. Engineer Julius Mackerle proposed a [...] "temporary" [...] solution of using the already developed 2.5-litre T603 engine in the new car (it was already successfully used in Tatra racecars and Tatra 87-603), while the larger one was supposed <b>to</b> be <b>ready</b> in the next 4-5 years.|$|R
60|$|When {{the party}} had thus fairly set out, and Phonny and Malleville had in some measure {{finished}} uttering the multitude of exclamations of delight with which they usually commenced a ride, they began to wish that Beechnut would tell them a story. Now Beechnut was a boy of boundless fertility of imagination, and he was <b>almost</b> always <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> tell a story. His stories were usually invented on the spot, and were often extremely wild and extravagant, both in the incidents involved in them, and in the personages whom he introduced as actors. The extravagance of these tales was however usually no objection to them in Phonny's and Malleville's estimation. In fact Beechnut observed that the more extravagant his stories were, the better pleased his auditors generally {{appeared to be in}} listening to them. He therefore did not spare invention, or restrict himself by any rules either of truth or probability in his narratives. Nor did he usually require any time for preparation, but commenced at once with whatever came into his head, pronouncing the first sentence of his story, very often without any idea of what he was to say next.|$|R
