5|$|Also in 1878 he drew up {{the plans}} for a theatre in the former town of Sant Gervasi de Cassoles (now a {{district}} of Barcelona); Gaudí did not {{take part in the}} construction of the theatre, which no longer exists. The following year he designed the furniture and counter for the Gibert Pharmacy, with marquetry of Arab influence. The same year he made five drawings for a procession in honour of the poet Francesc Vicent Garcia i Torres in Vallfogona de Riucorb, where this celebrated 17th-century writer <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> Lope de Vega was the parish priest. Gaudí's project was centred on the poet and on several aspects of agricultural work, such as reaping and harvesting grapes and olives; however, as a result of organisational problems Gaudí's ideas were not carried out.|$|E

5|$|Before Edward the Confessor became king of England, he was exiled to the continent. Leofric {{served as}} Edward's chaplain, {{although}} how or when exactly {{the two met}} is unknown.

Leofric remained a close supporter <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> Edward for the king's entire life. In 1044, Edward granted him lands at Dawlish in Devon.|$|E
5|$|Bernard Rhodes, a {{sometime}} {{associate of}} McLaren <b>and</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> the Sex Pistols, was similarly aiming to make {{stars of the}} band London SS.

On June 4, 1976, the Sex Pistols played Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall in {{what came to be}} {{regarded as one of the}} most influential rock shows ever. Among the approximately forty audience members were the two locals who organised the gig—they had formed Buzzcocks after seeing the Sex Pistols in February. Others in the small crowd went on to form Joy Division, the Fall, and—in the 1980s—the Smiths.|$|E
