Although {{all three}} stars are regard as chromospherically 'active', none exhibited any sensible rotational modulations, indicating a smooth surface distribution of chromospheric emission.

On the one hand, the C IV features of Procyon are narrow, while that of the Capella secondary and Caph are broad; differences in v sin i alone cannot explain the dichotomy. On the other hand, the high-excitation emissions of the Capella secondary and Procyon, but not Caph, exhibit statistically significant redshifts.

40|$|The {{transition}} region spectra of 87 late A and early F dwarfs and subgiants were analyzed. The emission line fluxes are uniformly {{strong in the}} early F stars, and drop off rapidly among the late A stars. The basal flux level in the F stars is consistent with an extrapolation of that observed among the G stars, while the magnetic component displays the same flux-flux relations seen among solar-like stars. Despite the steep decrease in {{transition region}} emission flux for B-V less than 0. 28, C II emission is detected in alpha Aql (B-V = 0. 22). The dropoff in emission is inconsistent with models of the mechanically generated acoustic flux available.

There is no correlation between surface flux and the stellar rotation rate in the early F dwarfs. The TR surface fluxes increase systematically with decreasing B-V color, with no evidence for any decrease in the activity as the convection zones become very small.

We investigate the applicability of our results to the multiphase media of several astrophysical systems, including quasar outflows and cooling flows.

40|$|A new {{means of}} heat {{transfer}} {{known as the}} piston effect was identified in 1989. The piston effect is where the expanding thermal boundary layer acts like a piston which compresses the bulk fluid. An examination of the equations {{for the conservation of}} mass, momentum, and energy identified the significant thermophysical properties as the thermal conductivity, the volume expansivity, and the isothermal compressibility. The thermal conductivity and the volume expansivity determine the thickness of the thermal boundary layer. The isothermal compressibility of the bulk fluid determines the pressure response of the bulk fluid to a given volume change. Previous researchers used only the van der Waals equation of state at conditions within mK of the critical point. The research described herein focuses on the pressure response of a fluid near the critical point to a sudden change in the boundary temperature. The use of the van der Waals equation of state for numerical simulation of the piston effect results in underpredicting the magnitude of the pressure wave by approximately 30 percent while overpredicting the <b>acoustic</b> <b>heating</b> by approximately 15 percent compared to using all fluid properties from a real gas equation of state. When evaluating the piston effect at conditions typical of cryogenic storage systems the pressure response of the fluid was observed to be six orders of magnitude larger than had been previously reported. The extent of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>heating</b> resulted in temperature increases in the bulk fluid that were four orders of magnitude larger. The real gas equation of state was used to compare the pressure and temperature response of oxygen and hydrogen due to a thermal disturbance at the boundary. The pressure rise in hydrogen after five acoustic time periods was only 17 % of the pressure rise in oxygen. The temperature increase in hydrogen was only 30 % of the temperature rise in oxygen. On the diffusion time scale the pressure rise in the oxygen is an order of magnitude larger than the pressure rise in hydrogen for the same thermal penetration depth. The temperature rise in oxygen is four times greater than the temperature rise in hydrogen...|$|E
40|$|We use a {{time-dependent}} hydrodynamics code {{to follow}} the propagation of acoustic waves into the corona of an M dwarf star. An important qualitative difference between M dwarfs and stars such as the Sun is that the acoustic spectrum in M dwarfs is expected to peak at periods close to the acoustic cutoff P(sub A) : this allows more effective penetration of waves into the corona. In our code, radiative losses in the photosphere, chromosphere, and corona are computed using Rosseland mean opacities, Mg II kappa and Ly alpha emission, and optically thin emissivities respectively.
