40|$|AbstractThe main notions {{concerning}} umbilics {{and lines}} of principal curvature, traditionally studied on surfaces in R 3, are extended {{in this paper}} to surfaces immersed in R 4. Departing from the classical second fundamental form and the ellipse of curvature of the immersion of a surface into R 4 here {{are studied in detail}} the concepts of a) axiumbilic points, analogous to classical umbilics since at them the ellipse of curvature has equal axes, and b) periodic lines of axial curvature, called here axial cycles, corresponding both to principal and mean curvature cycles in the classical R 3 case. To any immersed surface in R 4 its axial configurations: the principal configuration and the mean curvature configuration are associated. For surfaces in R 3, the first one reduces to the configuration by umbilics and principal lines, while the second one gives the configuration by umbilics and integral foliations of the mean curvature line fields. Also the notion of principal structural stability of immersions of surfaces into R 3 is extended to that of <b>axial</b> structural <b>stability,</b> for the case of surfaces in R 4. Sufficient conditions for the <b>axial</b> structural <b>stability</b> are provided in terms of axiumbilics, axial cycles and the asymptotic behavior of all the other lines of axial curvatur...|$|R

40|$|A {{detailed}} study {{was made of}} face and annular seals under conditions where boiling, i. e., phase change of the leaking fluid, occurs within the seal. Many seals operate in this mode because of flashing due to pressure drop and/or heat input from frictional heating. High pressure, water pumps, industrial chemical pumps, and cryogenic pumps are mentioned as a few of many applications. The initial motivation was the LOX-GOX seals for the space shuttle main engine, but the study was expanded to include any face or annular seal where boiling occurs. Some of the distinctive behavior characteristics of two-phase seals were discussed, particularly their <b>axial</b> <b>stability.</b> While two-phase seals probably exhibit instability to disturbances of other degrees of freedom such as wobble, etc., under certain conditions, such analyses are too complex to be treated at present. Since an all liquid seal (with parallel faces) has a neutral axial stiffness curve, and is stabilized axially by convergent coning, other degrees of freedom stability analyses are necessary. However, the <b>axial</b> <b>stability</b> behavior of the two-phase seal is always a consideration {{no matter how well}} the seal is aligned and regardless of the speed. Hence, <b>axial</b> <b>stability</b> is thought of as the primary design consideration for two-phase seals and indeed the stability behavior under sub-cooling variations probably overshadows other concerns. The main thrust was the dynamic analysis of axial motion of two-phase face seals, principally the determination of axial stiffness, and the steady behavior of two-phase annular seals. The main conclusions are that seals with two-phase flow may be unstable if improperly balanced. Detailed theoretical analyses of low (laminar) and high (turbulent) leakage seals are presented along with computer codes, parametric studies, and in particular a simplified PC based code that allows for rapid performance prediction. A simplified combined computer code for the performance prediction over the laminar and turbulent ranges of a two-phase seal is described and documented. The analyses, results, and computer codes are summarized...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} {{microfabricated}} ion traps for the quantum information community has allowed research groups to build traps that incorporate an unprecedented number of trapping zones. However, as device complexity has grown, {{the number of}} digital-to-analog converter (DAC) channels needed to control these devices has grown as well, {{with some of the}} largest trap assemblies now requiring nearly one hundred DAC channels. Providing electrical connections for these channels into a vacuum chamber can be bulky and difficult to scale beyond the current numbers of trap electrodes.

Obtained results indicate that <b>axial</b> <b>stability</b> of SWCNT reduces significantly due to topological defects.

Aims: The aim of this diploma thesis is to assess the effect of "plank" position exercise on postural stability of the individual, which is assessed using dynamic comtuterized posturography (NeuroCom SMART EquiTest System). Summary: This pilot study involved 10 women ranging in age from 20 to 30 years. Participants of the study underwent thirty-day exercise intervention program, during which endurance time in "plank" position was increased gradually each day. Postural stability was measured by dynamic computerized posturography SMART EquiTest System before and after the exercise program from NeuroCom.

40|$|One-dimensional {{nanostructures}} {{with high}} aspect-ratios and nanometer cross-sectional dimensions {{have been the}} focus of recent studies in the persistent drive to miniaturize devices. Conventional bottom-up methods such as vapor-liquid-solid growth have been widely applied for the fabrication of uniform and high quality nanowires. Two challenges toward nanoelectronics and other applications remain: on the single-nanowire level, precisely manipulating an individual nanowire for the sophisticated functionalities, and on the multiple-nanowire level, integrating nanowires into designed architecture at large scale. Thus, an alternative approach with the capacity to achieve ordered and extended nanowires is highly desirable. In this thesis, we observe an intriguing phenomenon that a cylindrical shell upon reaching a characteristic thickness breaks up into filament arrays during optical-fiber thermal drawing. This structural evolution occurs exclusively in the cross-sectional plane, while the uniformity along the axial direction remains intact. We demonstrate crystalline semiconductor nanowires by post-drawing annealing procedure and characterize their electrical and optoelectric properties for the devices such as optical switch. This top-down thermal drawing approach provides new opportunities for nanostructure fabrication with high throughput and at low cost, and offers promising applications in renewable energy and data storage. In order to understand the stability (or instability) of thin shells and filaments, we explore a physical mechanism during the complicated thermal drawing. A perspective of capillary instability from fluid mechanics is focused. <b>Axial</b> <b>stability</b> of continuous filaments is consistent with capillary instability. <b>Axial</b> <b>stability</b> of a thicker cylindrical shell arises from large radius and high viscosity.

None of these children had clinical signs or symptoms of temporomandibular disorders. Nineteen children were treated with a Clark Twin-block appliance for 6 months; the other 21 children received no treatment and served as controls. Comparison between control and Clark Twin-block groups suggested that reduction of the condylar axial angle represents a feature of untreated Class II growth patterns, whereas <b>axial</b> angle <b>stability</b> with Clark Twin-block therapy may suggest alteration of condylar growth direction. Condyles that were positioned at the crest of the articular eminence by the Clark Twin-block at the beginning of treatment had reseated back into the glenoid fossa after 6 months. However, 75 % of the condyles were more anteriorly positioned in successfully treated Clark Twin-block cases. There was no clear evidence of remodeling of the glenoid fossa at the eminence as a result of Clark Twin-block treatment. The initial prevalence of disk displacements for the combined groups was 7. 5 % anterior, 5 % medial, and 12. 5 % for lateral disk displacement.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{developments in}} <b>axial</b> compressor <b>stability</b> modeling {{over the last}} several years, and related work in active control of rotating stall and surge. Several major themes have emerged during this work. One theme is the interplay between hydrodynamic perturbations in axial compressors and instability inception. The former obey linearized dynamical equations, but their resonance and instability can trigger a variety of nonlinear events leading to violent oscillations in the compressor flow. An understanding of the key physical phenomena associated with stall inception, as opposed to those governing fully developed stall or surge, is critical to alleviating stall by design means or through active control. Another theme is the utility of actuators for understanding compressor stability. Active control work has prompted the installation of high-response forcing devices in compressors; even without feedback these have yielded much new information about compressor unsteady behavior. Finally, the paper reviews the methods and prospects for using active stabilization to extend the stable operating range of compressors, improving their surge margin and thus increasing overall reliability and performance. Experiments have progressed from laboratory scale demonstrations to full-scale rig and engine tests in about a decade. Competing theories about the physical mechanisms, the difficulties associated with stabilization, and the goals and control techniques for rotating stall have led to a rich research base on which compressor stability and control technology is being built. 1...|$|R

40|$|Early {{stages of}} {{intervertebral}} disc degeneration are postulated to cause instability. In the literature, however, some authors report the opposite. These contradictory positions are probably {{supported by the}} mostly small number of segments which are investigated. The aim of this project therefore {{was to investigate the}} influence of intervertebral disc degeneration on lumbar spine rotational stability using a large data set. The flexibility data from all spine specimens tested in our institute so far were collected in a large in vitro database. From this database, all lumbar spine specimens were selected, which had been tested for flexibility under pure moment loads of ± 7. 5  N m and for which radiographs were accessible. 203 segments met these criteria. Their radiographic degree of disc degeneration was determined on a scale from 0 (no degeneration) to 3 (severe degeneration) and their influence on the respective range of motion and neutral zone was examined. The different lumbar levels differ in flexibility, which increases the variability of the data if pooled together. To minimise this effect a statistical model was fitted. The model-based mean estimates showed a decrease of the range of motion from grade 0 to 3 in flexion/extension (by 3. 1 °, p    0. 05). The neutral zone was affected in a similar way but to a smaller degree (p >  0. 05).
