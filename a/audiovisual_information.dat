The purpose of the <b>audiovisual</b> patient <b>information</b> is to inform patients about randomized controlled trials, {{as a supplement to}} their trial-specific written <b>information</b> sheet. Background. <b>Audiovisual</b> patient <b>information</b> is known to be an effective way of informing patients about treatment. User involvement is also recognized as being important in the development of service provision. The {{aim of this}} paper is (i) to describe and discuss the process of developing the <b>audiovisual</b> patient <b>information</b> and (ii) to highlight the challenges and opportunities, thereby identifying implicationsfor practice. A future study will test the effectiveness of the <b>audiovisual</b> patient <b>information</b> in the cancer clinical trial setting. Methods. An advisory group was set up to oversee the project and provide guidance in relation to information content, level and delivery. An expert panel of two patients provided additional guidance and a dedicated operational team dealt with the logistics of the project including: ethics; finance; scriptwriting; filming; editing and intellectual property rights. Results. Challenges included the limitations of filming in a busy clinical environment, restricted technical and financial resources, ethical needs and issues around copyright. There were, however, substantial opportunities that included utilizing creative skills, meaningfully involving patients, teamworking and mutual appreciation of clinical, multidisciplinary and technical expertise. Conclusion. Developing <b>audiovisual</b> patient <b>information</b> is an important area for nurses to be involved with. However, this must be performed {{within the context of the}} multiprofessional team. Teamworking, including patient involvement, is crucial as a wide variety of expertise is required. Relevance to clinical practice.

5000|$|The McGurk {{effect is}} an {{auditory}} illusion {{in which people}} perceive a different syllable when incongruent audiovisual speech is presented: an auditory syllable [...] "ba" [...] is presented while the mouth movement is [...] "ga". As a result, the listener perceives the syllable [...] "da". However, according to Gentilucci and Cattaneo (2005), not everyone perceives this illusion; only about 26% to 98% of the population are susceptible to this illusion. One of the psychological models that explains the interindividual differences in speech perception is the fuzzy logic model of speech perception According to this model, a categorization process is carried out when processing speech sounds. When listening to a stimulus, {{the features of the}} acoustic signal are analyzed. Subsequently, this signal is compared with the features that are stored in the memory; finally the sound is classified into the category that best fits. However, this classification may have a blurred boundary respectively to the category which the sound belongs to. As a result, the final decision may depend on integration of multiple sources of information. When the McGurk effect is presented the auditory and visual components of the speech are separately evaluated before being integrated. In those who perceive the McGurk effect, the visual information has a higher influence on the perception of the ambiguous <b>audiovisual</b> <b>information</b> and thus the sound is classified as [...] "da".|$|E

Recall of information is crucial for optimal health outcomes, such as adequate disease management and adherence to medical regimes.

Presenting information in an audiovisual format using conversational narration style is expected to optimize recall of information compared to other combinations of modality and narration style. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate the effect of modality and narration style on recall of health information, and whether there are differences between younger and older adults. We conducted a Web-based experiment using a 2 (modality: written vs <b>audiovisual</b> <b>information)</b> by 2 (narration style: formal vs conversational style) between-subjects design (N= 440). Age was assessed in the questionnaire and included as a factor: younger (< 65 years) versus older (≥ 65 years) age. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four experimental webpages where information about lung cancer treatment was presented. A Web-based questionnaire assessed recall of eHealth information. Audiovisual modality (vs written modality) was found to increase recall of information in both younger and older adults (P=. 04). Although conversational narration style (vs formal narration style) did not increase recall of information (P=. 17), a synergistic effect between modality and narration style was revealed: combining <b>audiovisual</b> <b>information</b> with conversational style outperformed combining written information with formal style (P=. 01), as well as written information with conversational style (P=. 045).

40|$|While {{everyone}} has experienced that seeing lip movements may improve speech perception, {{little is known}} about the neural mechanisms by which <b>audiovisual</b> speech <b>information</b> is combined. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while subjects performed an auditory recognition task among four different natural syllables randomly presented in the auditory (A), visual (V) or congruent bimodal (AV) condition. We found that: (i) bimodal syllables were identified more rapidly than auditory alone stimuli; (ii) this behavioural facilitation was associated with cross-modal [AV-(A+V) ] ERP effects around 120 - 190 ms latency, expressed mainly as a decrease of unimodal N 1 generator activities in the auditory cortex. This finding provides evidence for suppressive, speech-specific audiovisual integration mechanisms, which are likely to be related to the dominance of the auditory modality for speech perception. Furthermore, the latency of the effect indicates that integration operates at pre-representational stages of stimulus analysis, probably via feedback projections from visual and/or polymodal areas...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and {{background}} Recruitment to cancer clinical trials {{needs to be}} improved, as does patient understanding about clinical trials, to enable patients to make an informed choice {{about whether or not}} to take part. The main reason that clinically eligible patients do not take part in clinical trials is because they refuse; poor understanding of the research has been associated with patient refusal. <b>Audiovisual</b> patient <b>information</b> (AVPI) has been shown to improve knowledge/understanding in various areas of practice but there is limited information about its effect in the cancer clinical trial setting, particularly in relation to recruitment rates. Understanding the research is necessary for informed consent, and it was hypothesised that if patient understanding about clinical trials was increased with AVPI, then this could result in a {{reduction in the number of}} patients refusing clinical trials, and therefore provide an ethical approach to improving recruitment. This study aimed to test the impact of an <b>audiovisual</b> patient <b>information</b> intervention on recruitment to randomised cancer clinical trials (refusal rates), patient understanding of the information given, and levels of anxiety. Reasons for patients’ decisions about trial participation were also assessed. Method An AVPI intervention was developed that aimed to address the common misconceptions associated with randomisation and clinical equipoise, as well as improve patient understanding generally of randomised cancer trials, and of other core clinical trial informational requirements, such as voluntariness. Patients were randomised to receive either AVPI in addition to the standard trial-specific written information, or the written information alone. A new questionnaire was developed to assess patient understanding (also referred to as knowledge) in the randomised trial setting and, following testing with patients and research nurses, this was shown to be reliable and valid. Patients completed self-report questionnaires to assess their understanding (new knowledge questionnaire) and anxiety (Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), at baseline and after they had made their decision about clinical trial entry, when their perceptions of the intervention, as well as factors contributing to their decision were also determined (this tool incorporated Jenkins and Fallowfield’s (2005) questionnaire which assessed reasons for accepting and declining randomised cancer trials).

The study uses a participatory approach with audiovisual tools and techniques to facilitate self-expression by women of different age cohorts, levels of literacy, and economic and social status {{about what it means to}} be a Muslim, a Moroccan, and a twenty-first century woman. The use of ICTs has helped women to learn how to represent complex concepts such as emancipation in ways that are more authentic than those given through portraits in the existing literature and media. In addition, the women show a remarkable and respectful capacity to listen to each other and an excitement for having discovered the ability to visualize electronic outcomes of their image collections and drawings. A supportive learning environment helps them articulate their problem with confidence. The research note concludes that in a situation where existing institutions do not provide the space for self-expression, debate, and learning about democracy, social media becomes an important tool for an inductive process of women's emancipation, starting from the diversity of cultural meanings held by specific groups to respectful dialogues among them...|$|R

Previous {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) studies focused on the spatial localization of brain areas involved in <b>audiovisual</b> (AV) <b>information</b> processing, but the temporal characteristics of AV information flow in these regions remained unclear. In this study, we used fMRI and a novel information-theoretic approach to study the flow of AV sensory information. Subjects passively perceived sounds and images of objects presented either alone or simultaneously. Applying the measure of mutual information, we computed for each voxel the latency in which the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal had the highest information content about the preceding stimulus. The results indicate that, after AV stimulation, the earliest informative activity occurs in right Heschl's gyrus, left primary visual cortex, and the posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus, which is known as a region involved in object-related AV integration. Informative activity in the anterior portion of superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, right occipital cortex, and inferior frontal cortex was found at a later latency. Moreover, AV presentation resulted in shorter latencies in multiple cortical areas compared with isolated auditory or visual presentation. The results provide evidence for bottom-up processing from primary sensory areas into higher association areas during AV integration in humans and suggest that AV presentation shortens processing time in early sensory cortices...|$|R
