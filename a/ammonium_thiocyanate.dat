40|$|Background: Health issue {{become a}} serious problem in Indonesia such as Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD) {{nowadays}} is more attended because of the effects i. e. goitre. Goitre is the one of several IDD spectrums. Iodine deficiency {{is not the only}} affector of IDD. The others like goitrogenic substances, for the example is thiocyanate can be a competitor with iodine in the tyroid hormone synthesis. The levels of endemicities for certain area is assessed based on the size alteration of tyroid gland (TGR). Urine Excretion Iodine can discribe the iodine intake by person. The most thiocyanate excretion is by the kidney, so that the levels can be checked in urine. It is important to know whether goitre is affected by iodine defficiency or thiocyanate consumption. Therfore this research aims to determine the relationship between UEI, Urine Thiocyanate Excretion and TGR. Methode : This was an analytical observational research with cross sectional design. Samples were 67 respondens. Simple random sampling were done with them. TGRs were secondary data from Dinas Kesehatan of Brebes Regency in 2010 / 2011. EIU was measured with Acid Digestion Methode with persultafe <b>ammonium.</b> Urine <b>Thiocyanate</b> Excretion was measured with spectrophotometri methode. The data were subjected to statistical analysis for correlation at 5 % level of significance and regression, using SPSS 15. 0 for WindowsResults : UEI levels were 192, 00 + 349 (346, 00) μg/L. Urine Thiocyanate Levels were 0, 36 + 4, 64 (1, 69) μg/mL. With the Spearman Test was showed that there was a relationship between UEI and TGR at 5 % level of significance (p= 0, 001). There was no relationship between Urine Thiocyanate Levels and TGR at 5 % level of significance (p= 0, 491). The R 2 value was 0, 022 using Regression Test for EIU and TGR.

40|$|Abstract. Highly toxic {{industrial}} effluents {{are often}} difficult to treat in biological wastewater treatment plants (BWWTP). Results obtained during a previous pilot-plant study allowed the identification of key parameters needed for the degradation of high concentrations of cyanides, <b>thiocyanates</b> and <b>ammonium</b> [13]. Kinetic models and parameter values were given for the pilot conditions using a synthetic effluent and commercial bacterial inoculums (Ecosynergie Inc.). In the present paper, these results have been applied to an existing full-scale BWWTP that was treating wastewaters from the coke and steel industry. The full-scale BWWTP contained the same contaminants and bacterial inoculums {{that were used in}} the pilot study. A conceptual hydraulic model of the BWWTP was built using STELLA software (ISEE Systems) and was adapted to the main contaminants undergoing degradation in the waste stream, using the same kinetics and parameters determined during the pilot study for the degradation of cyanide, <b>thiocyanate,</b> <b>ammonium</b> concentrations, and pH. Verification of the models using field data gave a close fit between simulated outlet concentrations and field outlet concentrations with only one significant parameter adjustment. The pilot studies were thus considered to be representative and conditions for this and for the observed discrepancies are discussed. The interest in alternative plant management policies such as pH regulation or new recycling flow patterns have been evaluated by adjusting parameters as variables in the model frame. The STELLA diagrams built for cyanide...|$|R

40|$|The {{methodology}} of ultrafast multiple-mode multiple-dimensional vibrational spectroscopy {{has been developed}} and applied to investigate the vibrational energy dissipation in condensed phase. In particular, experiments have {{been focused on the}} studies of vibrational energy relaxation and mode-specific vibrational energy transfer in both heterogeneous and homogeneous phases. This thesis presents two distinctive vibrational energy dissipation pathways for molecules absorbed on the typical heterogeneous metal nanoparticle surfaces. On 2 - 10 nm platinum and palladium nanoparticles, {{it was found that the}} electronic excitation-mediated vibrational energy dissipation (~ 2 ps) was at least one order magnitude faster than direct vibration-vibration relaxation (50 ps). This electronic energy damping is accompanied by low frequency thermal energy generation on metallic surfaces. This electronic mediated pathway dominates until the electronic property of the particle is altered by reducing size to ~ 1 nm. The energy relaxation pathway also could be altered by changing the chemical nature of the metallic nanoparticle. These findings are of fundamental importance to ultimately understanding the nature of heterogeneous catalysis. This thesis also demonstrates mode-specific vibrational energy exchange between ions in electrolyte solution. (i) Interactions between model molecules representing different building-blocks of proteins and thiocyanate anions in aqueous solutions are studied. The binding affinity between the thiocyanate anions and the charged amino acid residues is about 20 times bigger than that between water molecules and the amino acids, and about 5 ~ 10 times larger than that between the anions and neutral backbone amide groups. (ii) Ion segregation was also investigated by mode-specific vibrational energy exchange between thiocyanate anions. In aqueous solutions, it was found that “structure maker” ions, such as F-, would stay in the “water phase” and thereby promote aggregation of the SCN- in an “ionic phase”. “Structure breaker” ions, such as I-, would break the ionic SCN- phase. (iii) Mediated by combination band, vibrational energy flow down from <b>thiocyanate</b> to <b>ammonium</b> was used to confirm that ion pair is formed between <b>ammonium</b> and <b>thiocyanate</b> in aqueous solutions. Investigations of these microscopic structures and dynamics of aqueous salt solutions experiments will add depth to our understanding of general macroscopic properties of electrolyte solutions...|$|R

They are submitted to traffic loads and exposed to environmental conditions (rain, wind, marine environment, de-icing salts). These loads can lead to two main damage causes: fretting-fatigue and corrosion. These both phenomena can be coupled and lead to premature failures of drawn steel wires. In fact, at specific contact points, cracks are often initiated by fretting-fatigue. Fretting-fatigue {{is due to the}} cable bending. Near anchorages, the bending deformations are the highest and can generate damage (wire cracks). Cracks may propagate under traffic or wind fatigue load. They are also often submitted to a severe environment. Indeed, even if cables are initially protected, these protections can deteriorate and then cables are subject to corrosion. Experimental results show that wire cracks are often initiated by fretting-fatigue and crack propagation is due to fatigue or fatigue corrosion. In this study wire crack is initiated by fretting-fatigue first and fatigue tests are set up after with several environments in order to evaluate their influence on the crack propagation. The studied corrosive environments are: distilled water, sodium chloride solution and <b>thiocyanate</b> <b>ammonium</b> solutions with different concentrations. Lifetimes of specimens are compared. Metallographic and fractographic observations show the influence of the different solutions on the crack propagation. Indeed, since the microstructure of the steel wires is fully oriented in the longitudinal direction, corrosion changes the crack propagation modes and favours mixed mode propagation or longitudinal propagation...|$|R
