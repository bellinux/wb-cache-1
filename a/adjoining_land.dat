5|$|After the {{purchase}} of the original site in 1919, {{the purchase}} of Gilwellbury and <b>adjoining</b> <b>land</b> in 1945 is probably the next most important in Gilwell Park's Scouting history because it allowed The Scout Association to close the original road and fully utilize Branchet Field. It was originally used for small retreats and conferences but is now used as staff accommodation. The Ministry of Education assisted in the purchase.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Boy Scout Association bought <b>adjoining</b> <b>land</b> to {{increase}} the estate and protect it from rapidly approaching new developments. These areas are called The Quick, New Field, and Hilly Field. An additional purchase and a donation from South Africa in the early 1950s brought the estate to its present size. This began an era of expanding camping facilities for Scouts which lasted until the early 1960s. Training and sleeping facilities were added through the early 1970s. The Boy Scout Association was renamed The Scout Association in 1967.|$|E

5|$|M-294 runs northward along Beadle Lake Road from I-94 at exit100 north {{through a}} {{commercial}} area. Past these businesses, the <b>adjoining</b> <b>land</b> is not developed {{for a short}} distance, and the roadway runs through some woodlands. North of the intersection with Golden Avenue, the highway passes through a residential neighborhood before terminating at M-96 (Columbia Avenue). The highway lies entirely within Emmett Township just southeast of Battle Creek. The trunkline carries an average annual daily traffic of 6,078vehicles south, and 5,728vehicles north, of Golden Avenue according to a traffic survey completed by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) in 2010. The highway has not been included {{as a part of}} the National Highway System, a system of highways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|The {{farmhouse}} {{was damaged}} by fire in 1897. In 1926 the owner, Somerset cricketer Major Vernon Hill, offered the priory {{for sale to}} the local council, but the council did not purchase it. Major and Mrs Hill continued to own the priory until 1928, when it was bought by the Agricultural Land Company and rented to local farmers. In 1932 it was the venue for Alan Cobham's Flying Circus providing aviation displays. In 1968 the priory and <b>adjoining</b> <b>land</b> of Middle Hope was purchased by the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty as part of Project Neptune.|$|E
5|$|Built in 1950, this modern, Roman Catholic {{church is}} located at Millway, {{and is the only}} place of worship in the suburb. It was also a social hub, hosting regular events such as Christmas fayres. In 2009 however, parish priest David Taylor was arrested in {{connection}} with a number of indecent assaults on young boys in his care and was suspended from his joint parish of St Peter's, Low Fell and the Annunciation. Taylor admitted five charges at Durham Crown Court in 2009 and was given a prison sentence. On 20 April 2012, a final mass was held by the Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle and the church was closed. As of 2012 the building remains standing, although property company GVA are inviting tenders for the church and <b>adjoining</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Wheeler family {{stayed at}} the ranch many a summer. In 1900, Wheeler invited his client Phoebe Hearst to visit Wheeler Ranch with his family for the summer. Hearst {{asked if she could}} {{purchase}} the land, but Wheeler declined. Insistent, Hearst came to an arrangement whereby she would purchase a 99-year lease on part of the land, and she also purchased <b>adjoining</b> <b>land</b> held by Edward Clark, her financial adviser, who called it Wyntoon for the local Wintu tribe. Hearst applied the name Wyntoon to the combination of Clark's former holdings and her new lease, and in 1901 contracted for a magnificent seven-story house to be built. Wheeler was displeased with the extravagant plans, as he and Hearst had previously agreed her building would be modest. However, he did not stop her.|$|E
5|$|The priory was founded, by William de Courtney, in {{the early}} 13th century, and {{dedicated}} to Thomas Becket. The small community built a church and monastic lodgings during the next hundred years. They were Victorine Canons who were influenced by the Cistercians who emphasised manual labour and self-sufficiency so that the clerks who had taken holy orders worked on the farm, {{as well as providing}} clergy for surrounding churches. Despite endowments of land the priory was not wealthy until the 15th century when further building work, including the current priory church, infirmary and barn was undertaken. It was dissolved in 1536 and then owned by local noblemen and leased to local farmers. In 1968 the priory and <b>adjoining</b> <b>land</b> of Middle Hope was purchased by the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty as part of Project Neptune. The following year the priory was taken over by the Landmark Trust who spent 20 years on restoration work, and now rent out the farmhouse as holiday accommodation.|$|E

40|$|Background In the British Isles, {{control of}} cattle {{tuberculosis}} (TB) is hindered by persistent infection of wild badger (Meles meles) populations. A large-scale field trial—the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT) —previously showed that widespread badger culling produced modest reductions in cattle TB incidence during culling, which were offset by elevated TB risks for cattle on <b>adjoining</b> <b>lands.</b> Once culling was halted, beneficial effects inside culling areas increased, while detrimental effects on <b>adjoining</b> <b>lands</b> disappeared. However, a full {{assessment of the}} utility of badger culling requires information on the duration of culling effects. Methodology/Principal Findings We monitored cattle TB incidence in and around RBCT areas after culling ended. We found that benefits inside culled areas declined over time, and were no longer detectable by three years post-culling. On <b>adjoining</b> <b>lands,</b> a trend suggesting beneficial effects immediately {{after the end of}} culling was insignificant, and disappeared after 18 months post-culling. From completion of the first cull to the loss of detectable effects (an average five-year culling period plus 2. 5 year...|$|R
