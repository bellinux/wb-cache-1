5|$|In 1981, George {{published}} a revised arrangement that placed B.attenuata in the subgenus Banksia {{because of its}} flower spike, section Banksia because its styles are straight rather than hooked, and the series Cyrtostylis, a large and rather heterogenous series of twelve species. He conceded its large emarginate cotyledons (having a notch in their apex) were quite different from other members, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> similarities in flower architecture to another anomalous member B.elegans. He felt B.attenuata to have affinities to B.lindleyana and B.media.|$|E

5|$|In February 2007 it {{was found}} that when {{customers}} added value to their cards at self-service add-value points located in MTR and Light rail stations, their bank accounts were debited even if the transactions had been cancelled. Octopus Cards Limited claimed that the fault was due to an upgrade of communication systems. Initially, two cases were reported. The company then announced that the use of the payment system, Electronic Payment Services (EPS), at add-value service points would be suspended until further notice, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> started an investigation into the reasons for the problem.|$|E
5|$|Installation of {{military}} communications equipment {{and plans to}} reclaim land. Malaysia alleged that Singapore's installation {{of military}} communications equipment on Pedra Branca was done secretly, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> only learned about this when it received Singapore's memorial in the case.

5|$|AT {{acquired}} TCI in 2000, inheriting its {{agreement with}} CSG. AT alleged CSG was not abiding by the contract's terms to provide favorable rates. A legal {{dispute between the}} two companies began in 2001 in arbitration court. Before the dispute was resolved, AT Broadband was acquired by Comcast, who wanted to use its own billing and customer service vendor. In October 2002, a judge ruled that CSG owed Comcast a $120 million refund <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> to reduce its prices. The two companies disagreed over whether the ruling would allow Comcast to halt their agreement {{before the end of}} its term. CSG and Comcast reached new agreements or extensions in March 2004 and in 2008. In 2014 its work with Comcast was expanded to cover all of its customer support and billing for residential services.|$|E
5|$|Charles XI {{had complained}} of stomach pains since 1694. In {{the summer of}} 1696, he asked his doctors for an opinion on the pain as it had {{continuously}} become worse, {{but they had no}} viable cure or treatment for it. He continued to perform his duties as usual, but, in February 1697, the pains became too severe for him to cope and he returned to Stockholm where the doctors discovered he had a large, hard lump in his stomach. At this point there was little the doctors could do except alleviate the King's pain as best they could. Charles XI died on 5 April 1697, in his forty-first year. An autopsy showed that the King had developed cancer <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> spread through his entire abdominal cavity.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary {{accounts}} {{describe the}} Mascarene grey parakeet as a grey, long-tailed parrot. Subfossils show that its beak was about 30% {{longer than that}} of the sympatric echo parakeet, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> a comparatively broad beak. Members of the Psittacula genus commonly have large, red beaks, and long tail feathers, with the central ones being the longest. It also differed from its congeners in other osteological details. It was skeletally similar to the Alexandrine parakeet, but some of its bones were larger and more robust. Its colouration also separated it from all other members of Psittacula, the majority of which are green or partially green.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{the common}} understanding, the {{crossing}} of the Andes {{was not the first}} time that a military expedition crossed the mountain range. The difference from previous operations was the size of the army, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> to be ready for combat right after the crossing. The army was divided in six columns, each taking a different path. Colonel Francisco Zelada in La Rioja took the Come-Caballos pass towards Copiapó. Juan Manuel Cabot, in San Juan, moved to Coquimbo. Ramón Freire and José León Lemos led two columns in the south. The bulk of the armies left from Mendoza. San Martín, O'Higgins and Soler led a column across the Los Patos pass, and Juan Gregorio de Las Heras another one across the Uspallata Pass.|$|E
5|$|During {{the tour}} an {{anonymous}} person named Publius posted {{a message on}} an internet newsgroup, inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. The veracity of the message was demonstrated when white lights {{in front of the}} stage at a performance in East Rutherford spelled out the words Enigma Publius. During a televised concert at Earls Court in October 1994, the word enigma was projected in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later acknowledged that the Publius Enigma did exist, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been instigated by the record company rather than the band. As of 2014 the puzzle remains unsolved.|$|E

5|$|Starbreeze {{partnered with}} Electronic Arts {{to develop a}} reboot to the Syndicate series, but it ended up being a {{commercial}} failure, and many staff members moved to rival company MachineGames, established by Starbreeze's founders. As a result, the company shifted part of its focus to developing smaller games, such as Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. Starbreeze began expanding the company in 2012 with its acquisition of Overkill Software. Overkill's first title after the acquisition, Payday 2, helped Starbreeze make a record profit after suffering an accumulated loss of $14.4 million since its inception. In 2015, the company {{announced that it would}} start publishing video games from independent developers, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> begun the development of a virtual reality headset named Project Star VR.|$|E
5|$|The use of long-exposure {{photographic}} plates {{made possible}} the discovery of additional moons. The first to be discovered in this manner, Phoebe, was found in 1899 by W.H. Pickering. In 1966 the tenth satellite of Saturn was discovered by Audouin Dollfus, when the rings were observed edge-on near an equinox. It was later named Janus. A few years later it was realized that all observations of 1966 could only be explained if another satellite had been present <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> an orbit {{similar to that of}} Janus. This object is now known as Epimetheus, the eleventh moon of Saturn. It shares the same orbit with Janus—the only known example of co-orbitals in the Solar System. In 1980, three additional Saturnian moons were discovered from the ground and later confirmed by the Voyager probes. They are trojan moons of Dione (Helene) and Tethys (Telesto and Calypso).|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1860s, one of Heliade's main {{interests}} was {{an investigation}} into the issues involving Romanian history during the origin of the Romanians and the early medieval history of the Danubian Principalities. At a time when, in Moldavia, the newly surfaced Chronicle of Huru traced a political lineage of the country to the Roman Empire through the means of a narrative which was later proven to be entirely fictional, Heliade made use of its theses to draw similar conclusions regarding Wallachia. His conservative views were thus expanded to the level of historiographic thesis: according to Heliade, boyars had been an egalitarian and permeable class, which, from as early as the times of Radu Negru, had adopted humane laws that announced and welcomed those of the French Revolution (he notably claimed that the county-based administration was a democratic one, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been copied from the Israelite model as depicted in the Bible).|$|E
