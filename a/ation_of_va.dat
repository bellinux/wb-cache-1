The assumed,nite-deformation kinematics allows for,nite membrane and thickness stretching, {{as well as}} for large de 9 ections and bending strains. The interpolation of the undeformed and deformed surfaces of the shell is accomplished through the use of subdivision surfaces. The resulting ‘subdivision elements’ are strictly C 1 -conforming, contain three nodes and one single quadrature point per element, and carry displacements at the nodes only. The versatility and good performance of the subdivision elements is demonstrated {{with the aid of a}} number of test cases, including the stretching of a tension strip; the in 9 <b>ation</b> <b>of</b> a spherical shell under internal pressure; the bending and in 9 <b>ation</b> <b>of</b> a circular plate under the action of uniform pressure; and the in 9 <b>ation</b> <b>of</b> square and circular airbags.

40|$|The {{regulatory}} mechanism of centrosome function {{is crucial to}} the accurate transmission of chromosomes to the daughter cells in mitosis. Recent findings on the posttranslational modifications of many centrosomal proteins led us to speculate that these modifications might be involved in centrosome behavior. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP- 1) catalyzes poly(ADP-ribosyl) ation to various proteins. We show here that PARP- 1 localizes to centrosomes and catalyzes poly(ADP-ribosyl) <b>ation</b> <b>of</b> centrosomal proteins. Moreover, centrosome hyperamplification is frequently observed with PARP inhibitor, as well as in PARP- 1 -null cells. Thus, it is possible that chromosomal instability known in PARP- 1 -null cells {{can be attributed to the}} centrosomal dysfunction. P 53 tumor suppressor protein has been also shown to be localized at centrosomes and to be involved in the regulation of centrosome duplication and monitoring of the chromosomal stability. We found that centrosomal p 53 is poly(ADP-ribosyl) ated in vivo and centrosomal PARP- 1 directly catalyzes poly(ADP-ribosyl) <b>ation</b> <b>of</b> p 53 in vitro. These results indicate that PARP- 1 and PARP- 1 -mediated poly(ADP-ribosyl) <b>ation</b> <b>of</b> centrosomal proteins are involved in the regulation of centrosome function...|$|R
40|$|The {{biological}} functions <b>of</b> poly(ADP-ribosyl) <b>ation</b> <b>of</b> heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are {{not well}} understood. However, {{it is known that}} hnRNPs are involved in the regulation of alternative splicing for many genes, including the Ddc gene in Drosophila. Therefore, we first confirmed that poly(ADP-ribose) (pADPr) interacts with two Drosophila hnRNPs, Squid/hrp 40 and Hrb 98 DE/hrp 38, and that this function is regulated by Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase 1 (PARP 1) and Poly(ADP-ribose) Glycohydrolase (PARG) in vivo. These findings then provided a basis for analyzing the role of pADPr binding to these two hnRNPs in terms of alternative splicing regulation. Our results showed that Parg null mutation does cause poly(ADP-ribosyl) <b>ation</b> <b>of</b> Squid and hrp 38 protein, as well as their dissociation from active chromatin. Our data also indicated that pADPr binding to hnRNPs inhibits the RNA-binding ability of hnRNPs. Following that, we demonstrated that poly(ADP-ribosyl) <b>ation</b> <b>of</b> Squid and hrp 38 proteins inhibits splicing of the intron in the Hsrω-RC transcript, but enhances splicing of the intron in the Ddc pre-mRNA. Taken together, these findings suggest that poly(ADP-ribosyl) ation regulates the interaction between hnRNPs and RNA and thus modulates the splicing pathways...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Veterinary Antibiotics (VAs) are {{emerging}} agricultural contaminants. They {{are applied to}} agricultural fields in excrement-based fertilizers around the world. Whilst VA groundwater and plant contamination has been researched over the past decades, the overland transport <b>of</b> <b>VAs</b> in runoff water and the associated soil erosion has received significantly less global research attention. The overland transport <b>of</b> <b>VAs</b> from fields may result in the contamination of surface water systems (water and sediment) with potentially negative consequences for ecosystems and humans. Focusing on the tetracycline and sulfonamide antibiotic groups in particular, {{the aim of the}} thesis was to clearly conceptualize the overland transport <b>of</b> <b>VAs</b> (considering the effects <b>of</b> <b>VA</b> behaviour and time) and to subsequently predict the masses <b>of</b> <b>VAs</b> that are transported overland across the study area of Germany. Method: The thesis consists of five connected studies: (1) a literature review, examining the current state <b>of</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>VA</b> detection and behaviour (sorption and degradation) in different host materials and the mechanisms which dictate their overland transportation; (2) a sampling scheme, exploring the contamination of German water and sediment; (3) laboratory experiments, determining the behavioural constants <b>of</b> <b>VAs</b> in excrement and soil; (4) the development of a numerical model (VANTOM: the Veterinary Antibiotic Transport Model), designed to estimate VA overland transport flux across a study area; (5) the implementation of VANTOM across Germany. Results: A clear conceptualization <b>of</b> the <b>VA</b> overland transport journey (from fertilizer to surface water systems) is presented for the first time. VA behavioural constants in solid and liquid form are provided for each stage <b>of</b> the journey. <b>VAs</b> were found to contaminate German surface water [ng l- 1] and sediment [µg kg- 1] during sampling, which reflects the concentrations of transported masses calculated by VANTOM. The area of maximum overland transport in Germany is predicted by VANTOM to be across the border of Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia. Transport in liquid form is greatest directly after the application of fertilizer to fields. Transport in solid form is greatest when maximum soil erosion from contaminated fields occurs (predictably following a harvest). Conclusion: Greater masses <b>of</b> <b>VAs</b> are accumulating and are transported from agricultural fields in solid form (i. e. attached to soil particles). Further research is therefore recommended into the effects <b>of</b> <b>VAs</b> on flora and fauna in contaminated soils and sediments. To reduce contamination, fertilizer should not be applied to fields directly after the administration <b>of</b> <b>VAs</b> to livestock animals and soil erosion mitigation methods should be improved...|$|R
