5|$|At {{the behest}} of the Paris Observatory under le Verrier, Marie Alfred Cornu {{repeated}} Fizeau's 1848 toothed wheel measurement in a series of experiments in 1872–76. The goal was to obtain a value for the speed of light accurate to one part in a thousand. Cornu's equipment allowed him to monitor high orders of extinction, up to the 21st order. Instead of estimating the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, a relatively inaccurate procedure, Cornu made pairs of observations {{on either side of the}} intensity minima, averaging the values obtained with the wheel spun clockwise and counterclockwise. An electric circuit recorded the wheel rotations on a chronograph chart which enabled precise rate comparisons against the observatory clock, and a telegraph key arrangement allowed Cornu to mark on this same chart the precise moments when he judged that an extinction had been entered or exited. His final experiment was run over a path nearly three times <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> used by Fizeau, and yielded a figure of 300400km/s that is within 0.2% of the modern value.|$|E
5|$|The {{nestling}} is born nearly featherless {{except for}} tiny primary quills {{and a fine}} down along its spine, humerus, forearm, and femur. Its skin is dark pink but displays variable black patches on its upperside. The gape is yellow. As the nestling develops, its plumage begins to resemble that of the adult, though it has white flecks on its wing coverts and the featherless skin on the head is black or dark brown, not powder blue, on the forecrown and dark reddish brown, not carmine, on the hindcrown. After fledging, the immature closely resembles the adult except for the bare patch {{on the back of}} the head being golden yellow instead of carmine and the tail being only a third <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of an adult.|$|E

5|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Supreme Court, Justice Stephen Breyer stated that the department's belief was all that mattered, since the Court's precedent in this area holds it is unconstitutional for a government agency to discipline an employee (who does not work under a contract that explicitly permits such discipline) for engaging in partisan political activity, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> activity is not disruptive to the agency's operations. Even if Heffernan was not engaging in protected speech, he wrote, the discipline against him sent a message to others to avoid exercising their rights. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he was joined by Justice Samuel Alito, in which he agreed that Heffernan had been harmed, but his constitutional rights had not been violated.|$|E

Another major success was the program Su nägu kõlab tuttavalt (Your Face Sounds Familiar), a musical parody show, that premiered in April 2013 on TV3 and became an instant hit with the viewers. In 2014, he created a role in the TV movie The last round, which the cast also took to {{theatrical}} tour in 2015.

25|$|The Women's Little 500 is {{a bicycle}} race held {{annually}} at Bill Armstrong Stadium {{on the campus}} of Indiana University Bloomington. The race is modelled after the men's Little 500. The race has been run the Friday before the men's race, since its conception in 1988. It consists of half the distance of the men's race: 100 laps (25.49 miles) around the quarter-mile cinder track (410-meters) at the Bill Armstrong Stadium. Racers usually compete in teams of four, but teams can be as few as two, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> was the number of team members with which they qualified for the race. These teams usually have a common bond such as living in the same residence hall or being members of the same sorority, or they simply are an independent group with common interests.

25|$|Clomipramine is {{a strong}} SRI. Its {{affinity}} for the SERT was reported in one study using human tissues to be 0.14nM, which is considerably {{higher than that of}} other TCAs. For example, the TCAs with the next highest affinities for the SERT in the study were imipramine, amitriptyline, and dosulepin (dothiepin), with Ki values of 1.4nM, 4.3nM, and 8.3nM, respectively. In addition, clomipramine has a terminal half-life that is around twice <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of amitriptyline and imipramine. In spite of these differences however, clomipramine is used clinically at the same usual dosages as other serotonergic TCAs (100–200mg/day). It achieves typical circulating concentrations that are similar in range to those of other TCAs but with an upper limit that is around twice that of amitriptyline and imipramine. For these reasons, clomipramine is the most potent SRI among the TCAs and is far stronger as an SRI than other TCAs at typical clinical dosages. In addition, clomipramine is similarly potent or even more potent as an SRI than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E

25|$|Probably no {{instrument}} in modern time so {{lends itself to}} threats to constitutional guarantees of individual freedom as the polygraph or so-called lie detector.

[...] Harrison also urged early statehood for the territories and advocated pensions for veterans, a statement that was met with enthusiastic applause.

500|$|The only {{supersonic}} airliner {{in direct}} competition with Concorde was the Soviet Tupolev Tu-144, nicknamed [...] "Concordski" [...] by Western European journalists for its outward similarity to Concorde. It had been alleged that Soviet espionage efforts {{had resulted in}} the theft of Concorde blueprints, supposedly {{to assist in the}} design of the Tu-144. As a result of a rushed development programme, the first Tu-144 prototype was substantially different from the preproduction machines, but both were cruder than Concorde. The Tu-144S had a significantly shorter range than Concorde. Jean Rech, Sud Aviation, attributed this to two things, a very heavy powerplant with an intake twice <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> on Concorde, and low-bypass turbofan engines with too-high a bypass ratio which needed afterburning for cruise. The aircraft had poor control at low speeds because of a simpler supersonic wing design; in addition the Tu-144 required braking parachutes to land while Concorde used anti-lock brakes. The Tu-144 had two crashes, one at the 1973 Paris Air Show, and another during a pre-delivery test flight in May 1978.|$|E
