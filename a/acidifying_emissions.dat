30|$|LCA {{approach}} was adopted {{for assessing the}} environmental suitability of the utilization of various renewable energy resources such as solar PV, wind, and biomass by Manish et al.[8]. The base cases considered were coal-based thermal power generation and steam methane reforming for hydrogen production. The comparison of different options was made based on major indicators like life cycle cost, green house gas (GHG) emissions, and net energy ratio (NER). Secondary biofuels produced from unprocessed primary biomass-based materials are sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. Secondary biofuels may be of solid, liquid, or gaseous types which are produced by adopting various production routes. A state-of-the-art review of literature pertaining to liquid biofuels was reported by Nigam and Singh [9]. Producer gas is a secondary gaseous biofuel generated by the thermochemical gasification of biomass. NER and total energy ratio {{of the life cycle}} of rice straw-generated producer gas were evaluated by Shie et al. [10]. A comparison of biomass and coal in terms of several environmental indicators for integrated gasification combined cycles with [11] and without [12, 13] CO 2 chemical absorption revealed the superiority of biomass. On further analysis of the potential of biomass to produce hydrogen, Koroneos et al.[2] reported the advantage of biomass gasification-syngas reformation-absorption route over biomass gasification-electricity generation-electrolysis route. Manish et al. [8] on reviewing the LCA studies on gasification with biomass and with biomass-coal blends for electricity generation reported an evident reduction in environmental impacts when biomass is used as energy source. However, the life cycle of biomass-based systems can have higher eutrophication potential [14] and <b>acidifying</b> <b>emission</b> potential. Consequences of using agricultural land for other purposes than food production [15] and the size and scale of the biomass-based combined heat and power (CHP) plant [16] are significant factors while utilizing biomass-based systems.|$|R

In this paper, the environmental aspects of fiber crops cultivation and use are reviewed. The analysis was based on the following categories: use of resources, emission of gases, effects on the quality of soil and water and biological and landscape diversity. As bioenergy and biomaterials carriers, fiber crops offer ecological advantages over conventional ones by contributing to carbon sequestration and energy savings, and to the reduction of greenhouse gases and non-renewable resources. However, other environmental outcomes, such as <b>acidifying</b> and eutrophication <b>emissions,</b> may limit the conversion and use of fiber crops. Even so, the low input requirements associated with this class of crops and its phytoremediation aptness for wastewaters or contaminated land, are some of the environmental advantages associated with fiber crops. Crop management options and processing choices can influence the outcomes, but site specific factors should be accurately assessed to evaluate the adequacy between crop and location.

Up to now, CFs for <b>acidifying</b> <b>emissions</b> did not cover the global scale and were only representative of their characterization model geographical scope. Consequently, current LCA practices implicitly assume that all emissions from a global supply chain occur within the continent referring to the characterization method geographical scope.

40|$|The use {{of ocean}} wave energy for {{electricity}} production has considerable potential, {{though it has}} proven to be difficult. A technology utilizing the heaving (up-and-down) motions of the waves was conceived at Uppsala University in the early 2000 ´s, and is being further developed for commercial use by Seabased Industry AB. The purpose of this master´s degree project was to increase the knowledge of the environmental performance of Seabased´s wave energy conversion concept and identifying possible areas of improvement. This was done by conducting a life cycle assessment (LCA) of a hypothetical prototype wave power plant. All flows of materials, energy, emissions and waste were calculated for all stages of a wave power plant´s life cycle. The potential environmental impact of these flows was then assessed, using the following impact categories: - Emission of greenhouse gases - Emission of ozone depleting gases - <b>Emission</b> of <b>acidifying</b> gases - <b>Emission</b> of gases that contribute to the forming of ground-level ozone - Emission of substances to water contributing to oxygen depletion (eutrophication) - Energy use (renewable and non-renewable) - Water use The methodology used was that prescribed by the ISO standard for Environmental Product Declarations (EPD) and further defined by the International EPD Programme. The potential environmental impact was calculated per kWh of wave power electricity delivered to the grid. The main result of the study is that the potential environmental impact of a wave power plant mainly stems from the manufacturing phase. In particular, the production of steel parts makes a large contribution to the overall results.

40|$|Acidification {{is still}} an {{important}} environmental burden that needs attention. Even nowadays large parts of central Europe (e. g. the Netherlands, Germany, and Poland) are heavily acidified. In this study European acidification, A, is expressed as “area of unprotected ecosystem in Europe”. An ecosystem is an area with uniform soil, vegetation, and organisms, like a forest or grassland. “Protected” and “unprotected” are terms used to indicate whether or not an ecosystem is harmed by the acidifying deposition it receives. When the SO 2, NOx, and NH 3 deposition on an ecosystem exceed the so called critical load of that ecosystem, the ecosystem is “unprotected”. Otherwise it is “protected” against acidification. This approach enables a quantification of the environmental effect acidification. Extended (integrated assessment) models determine acidification, A, resulting from emissions originating in European countries. However, these models require much computing time. Traditionally, acidification factors (AFs) linearly relate national emission changes (E) to changes in European acidification (A) : A = AF•E. For each country and each substance a separate AF exists. AFs can fasten acidification calculations, enabling for example real time computations during negotiations on emission reductions. Life cycle assessment (LCA) uses AFs to determine the acidifying impact from a product or service. AFs should approximate acidification with a reasonable accuracy and should be generally applicable. They should not depend heavily on model parameters like resolution. This report deals with the research question: how do AFs depend on spatial resolutions of emission and deposition, sector specific emissions, and grid cell specific emissions. We also try to indicate which kind of AFs, considering calculation method and E range, are to be preferred (considering the previously listed model parameters). Emissions and deposition resolution specific AFs relate E {{from one country to}} A in Europe. These national AFs are calculated with different emission and/or deposition resolutions of the extended model. Sector specific AFs relate E from one economic sector within a country to A in Europe. Using the national AFs instead of sector specific AFs will probably produce less accurate results when studying the influence of emission reduction within just one economic sector. Grid cell specific AFs relate E from a certain grid cell of 50 x 50 km 2 to A in Europe. Such AFs can be used to accurately determine the <b>acidifying</b> impact of <b>emissions</b> from a specific location (or small area). The current study considers AFs resulting from two different calculation methods and three E ranges. Ideally AFs do not depend on model parameters. A low sensitivity of AFs to emission/deposition resolution, sector specific emission, and grid cell specific emissions is preferable. The linearization error related to applying AFs instead of the extended model is important as well. Not only is a low value of the error wanted for optimal AFs but also a low sensitivity of the error to the model parameters. To answer the research questions we calculate A for given E, using different emission and deposition resolutions in the extended model. E ranges from - 50 % to + 20 % with steps of 1 %. AF equals the slope of a straight line through these points. In general it turned out that AFs depend in a non-systematic way on emission and deposition resolutions. Variations in AFs and linearization errors strongly correlate to the occurrence and size of so called “jumps”. Each E step of 1 % causes a step in A. Some A-steps are considerably larger than average; these are called “jumps”. The size of A-steps is determined by the number of ecosystems changing their state from “protected” to “unprotected” (or the other way around) and the area of these ecosystems. A step size of zero occurs when the change in deposition on the European ecosystems does not cause a change of the state of any of these ecosystems. This happens when deposition reductions (resulting from emission reductions) are too small to flip an ecosystem from “unprotected” to “protected”, when ecosystems are highly exceeding their critical load and requiring a very large deposition reduction to change their state, or when the ecosystems were already “protected”. When the A-step is not zero, the minimum situation is that one ecosystem changes its state. In that situation the A-step equals the area of this single ecosystem. The current research showed that often “jumps” are mainly caused by just one large ecosystem changing its state. Therefore, a smaller maximum size of ecosystems would result in smaller variations in AFs and smaller linearization errors. Both, sector and grid cell specific AFs deviate from the national AFs. This deviation is caused by a number of aspects including different absolute emission amounts. Grid cell specific AFs could not be calculated in a satisfying way applying the used model, because of the very small emission amounts involved. Large ranges of grid cell specific E (expressed as percentage of the grid cell specific emission) caused zero sized A-steps. For all experiments two methods to compute AFs were applied. AFs calculated using regression and using the Single Value (SV) method were compared. The SV method defines AF as A/E at a certain point, we use E = - 50 %. Regression techniques calculate a straight line through the points while minimizing the error. Theoretically regression AFs should be less sensitive to small variations in the model results. Most experiments in this report support this. Based on theoretical and experimental results we recommend regression AFs because they depend less on the studied model parameters. Regression AFs are computed over a certain range of emission changes. The report distinguishes regression AFs related to the whole emission range (- 50 % ≤ E ≤ + 20 %), large emission reduction mainly used in air pollution policy application (- 50 % ≤ E ≤ 20 %), and small emission changes mainly appearing in LCA applications (- 20 % ≤ E ≤ + 20 %). We expected the emission range specific AFs to be better than the AFs for the whole emission range. This effect was only slightly observed. When considering small emission changes, the AF related to - 20 % ≤ E ≤ + 20 % indeed resulted in smaller errors than the AF related to the whole emission range. However, this emission range specific AF was more sensitive to model parameters. In LCA the emission range specific AFs could slightly improve the accuracy of the calculated acidification. More important for LCA applications is the possibility to quantify the error. Uncertainty of LCA results has received increased attention lately. However, uncertainty calculations in LCA prefer a quantification of the uncertainty in AF itself, not in the resulting acidification (as was computed in the current research). Using AFs within air pollution policy is still in its infancy. The use of AFs increases the speed of the calculation of acidification. However, the error in the calculated acidification also increases. National AFs turned out to be not generally applicable, for example for sector specific emissions, without considerably increasing the uncertainty of the calculated acidification. The report quantifies this uncertainty for some situations. Air pollution policy should weight the increased uncertainty against the gained calculation speed. ...|$|R

We examined two decades of change in hindcasted food webs for Lochnagar, a Scottish mountain lake, to make inferences about the potential dynamical stability of the system and to assess the prospects for future biological recovery. Although community composition tracked temporal changes in acidity, this was neither sustained nor directional, and mainly manifested as shifts in relative abundances rather than the establishment of more acidsensitive species. The food web was highly interconnected and reticulate, especially in years when species richness was low, and subsidized by external inputs of detritus. Among the primary consumers, generalist herbivore– detritivores maintained feeding links with the scant algal resources, which appeared insufficient to support viable populations of specialist grazers. Together, these characteristics, which are shared with many other acidified freshwaters, are likely to make the community dynamically stable and resistant to invasions of potential new colonists, thereby slowing the pace of future biological recovery...|$|E

The cost-of-control functions allow the evaluation of targeted deposition levels at a variety of locations in Europe. This will be the topic of a subsequent paper. In the near future we will also develop similar control function for the emissions of nitrogen oxides and will eventually combine the functions into one cost-of-control function for <b>acidifying</b> <b>emissions...</b>|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{biogeochemistry}} {{models are}} important tools {{for determining the}} time-scales of recovery from acidification. In the review process of the 1999 UNECE LRTAP Gothenburg protocol, results from dynamic models will probably be included when determining further reductions of <b>acidifying</b> <b>emissions.</b> This thesis describes modeling of recovery from acidification using the dynamic multi-layer soil chemistry model SAFE. Sulfate adsorption was added to SAFE, modeled by a sulfate concentration and pH dependent isotherm. A method to parameterize this isotherm was developed and the isotherm was parameterized {{for a total of}} 20 sites, whereof 18 are located in Sweden, 1 in Germany and 1 in Poland. The SAFE model including sulfate adsorption was applied to 19 of these. The addition of sulfate adsorption improved the predictions of sulfate dynamics, especially at sites where there had been large deposition changes and where sulfate adsorption capacity is high. Three of the modeled sites are well-studied single-sites and 16 sites are a part of regional study. Differences in data requirements and model output for the different types of studies are discussed from a policy perspective. The influence of climate driven changes in sea-salt deposition and of changes in forest practices and vegetation on model predictions of recovery is also discussed. The SAFE model applications show that many sites in Sweden and Europe are still severely acidified and that soil recovery will require both further emission reductions and many decades of time...|$|E
40|$|The Reference Projection 2005 - 2020 {{covers the}} future {{development}} of Dutch energy use, {{greenhouse gas emissions}} and air pollution up to 2020. The Reference projection is based on assumptions regarding economic, structural, technological and policy developments. Two scenarios have been used: the Strong Europe (SE) scenario is characterized by moderate economic growth and strong public responsibility, the Global Economy (GE) scenario assumes high economic growth and has a strong orientation towards private responsibility. Energy consumption continues to grow in both scenarios and energy intensity is declining in the GE scenario. Gradual rise of temperature is now included in the estimates for space heating and air conditioning. Energy prices for end users will rise, due to increased imports of natural gas and rising costs of electricity generation. The share of renewables in electricity consumption increases considerably due to subsidies for wind at sea and biomass, up to the target of 9 % in 2010. Emissions of non-CO 2 greenhouse gases are reduced and stabilise after 2010. The Dutch Kyoto target is met in both scenarios, assuming considerable emission reduction efforts abroad. <b>Acidifying</b> <b>emissions</b> of NOx and SO 2 stabilise after reductions, but at levels that exceed their national emission ceiling (NEC). Emissions of volatile organic compounds are projected to fall with approximately 25 % between 2002 and 2010 below their NEC. Emissions of ammonia are projected to meet their NEC. The emission of fine particles (PM 10) will stabilise at present levels...|$|E
40|$|Acid {{deposition}} is {{a serious}} problem throughout much of Asia. Emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2 }) and nitrogen oxides (NO{sub x}) have been increasing steadily, as nations strive to increase their levels of economic development. Coal and fuel oil have been the main choices for powering industrial development; and, until recently, only a few countries (notably Japan and Taiwan) had taken significant steps to avert the atmospheric emissions that accompany fuel combustion. This paper discusses trends in emissions of SO{sub 2 } and NO{sub x} that have occurred in Asian countries in the period 1985 [...] 1997, using results from the RAINS-ASIA computer model and energy-use trends from the IEA Energy Statistics and Balances database. Emissions of SO{sub 2 } in Asia grew from 26. 6 Tg in 1985 to 33. 7 Tg in 1990 and to 39. 2 Tg in 1997. Though SO{sub 2 } emissions used to grow as fast as fossil-fuel use, recent limitations on the sulfur content of coal and oil have slowed the growth. The annual-average emissions growth between 1990 and 1997 was only 1. 1 %, considerably less than the economic growth rate. Emissions of NO{sub x}, on the other hand, continue to grow rapidly, from 14. 1 Tg in 1985 to 18. 7 Tg in 1990 and 28. 5 Tg in 1997, with no signs of abating. Thus, though SO{sub 2 } remains the major contributor to <b>acidifying</b> <b>emissions</b> in Asia, the role of NO{sub x}, will become more and more important in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of energy crops must be studied and evaluated in terms of environmental impact, in order to integrate them into a sustainable agricultural development. As bioenergy carriers they offer ecological advantages over fossil fuels by contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gases and <b>acidifying</b> <b>emissions.</b> However, there could be ecological shortcomings related to the intensity of agricultural production. There is a risk of polluting water and air, losing soil quality, enhancing erosion, and reducing biodiversity. In {{the scope of the}} project Future Crops for Food, Feed, Fiber and Fuel (4 F Crops), supported by the European Union, an environmental impact assessment study was developed and applied to the {{production of}} potential energy crops in Europe. The following variables were selected as categories: use of water and mineral resources, soil quality and erosion, emission of minerals and pesticides to soil and water, waste generation and utilization, landscape, and biodiversity. In addition, a normalization and weighting procedure was applied, which attempts to aggregate environmental impacts. Results suggest that growing energy crops does not inflict higher impact on the environment compared to potato and wheat farming (regarding the studied categories). Although the different indicators did not yield a common pattern, overall results suggest that woody and lignocellulosic crops have an advantage over annual crop systems, namely regarding erodibility and biodiversity. Some crop management options, such as pesticides and fertilizers inputs, can influence the outcomes. However, site-specific factors should be accurately assessed to evaluate the adequacy between crop and location. Environmental hotspots in the systems are detected and options for improvement are presented. (C) 2010 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltdstatus: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Sensitive receptors such as {{soil and}} fresh {{bodies of water}} are {{at the end of}} a long chain of events in the process of {{regional}} acidification. This chain begins thousands of kilometers upwind at the emitters of acidifying pollutants. The topics covered in this book are important in the study of regional acidification for two reasons. First, it is important to assess the sensitivity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to the deposition of acidifying pollutants. If the sensitivity of an ecosystem is known, then international control strategies can be developed to reduce deposition in the receptor areas of greatest importance. This is an important factor in designing the most effective strategies because of the very high costs of reducing emissions of acidifying pollutants. Second, it is important to be able to predict changes in ecosystems for decades into the future, whether it be an improvement owing to decreases in <b>acidifying</b> <b>emissions</b> or, alas, a further deterioration because control strategies are nonexistent or inadequate. In either event, it is important to be able to judge the results of our actions. Decision makers tend to be mistrustful of models unless they can judge their reliability. The application and testing of the models in Part III of this book cover, therefore, an important facet of model building. This book is an ideal companion to another book that is forthcoming from the Transboundary Air Pollution Project at IIASA: The RAINS Model of Acidification: Science and Strategies in Europe. The latter book is a description of the development and use of the Regional Acidification INformation and Simulation (RAINS) model, an integrated assessment model for developing and determining control strategies to reduce regional acidification in Europe. Much of the research described in this book forms part of the foundation of the RAINS model. These two books cover a great deal of the present knowledge about assessing and dealing with a very important environmental problem in Europe regional acidification...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, {{production}} processes have become increasingly fragmented: they are divided into ever smaller parts considered as separate activities, which are then spread over various locations in different countries. In other words, value chains for many products are becoming global. This implies that inputs into the production process are sourced from both local and foreign suppliers. The latter mode of sourcing is {{commonly referred to as}} offshoring. Expressed as the share of imported in total intermediates, offshoring has grown relatively fast in the recent past. Moreover, its scope has been extended as it increasingly encompasses not only manufacturing but also service activities. A typical example for the former is the sourcing from abroad of parts and components for car assembly. While offshoring of manufacturing activities has been occurring since long and has been largely facilitated by trade liberalisation, the offshoring of service activities such as the provision of accounting or call centre services is a more recent phenomenon that has been fostered by the increased tradability of such services. With the increasing scale and scope of offshoring, it becomes crucial to get a grasp of its drivers as well as the gains and threats associated with it. The latter are {{the focal point of the}} public and academic discussion around offshoring, in particular the potential threats for workers in developed economies. Typical questions that are being raised are whether offshoring leads to job losses in developed countries and whether it favours certain categories of workers and is to the disadvantage of others. These threats are directly linked to the motivations for engaging into offshoring. In this respect, wage costs play a prominent role. But other factors may also influence offshoring decisions, e. g. regulations, in particular those regarding the environment. Last but not least, offshoring may also entail gains for developed economies through the improvements in the efficiency of production. In this PhD thesis, several causes and consequences of offshoring are examined empirically for Belgium. The first issue that is investigated is whether offshoring of materials and business services affects industry-level employment. An improved offshoring intensity measure is introduced. It is a volume measure of the share of imported intermediates in output split into materials and business services and according to the country of origin of imports, i. e. high-wage and low-wage countries. Estimations of static and dynamic industry-level labour demand equations augmented by offshoring intensities do not reveal a significant impact of either materials or business services offshoring on total employment for Belgium. This result holds for both the manufacturing sector and the service sector and it proves robust to splitting the manufacturing sector into high-technology and low-technology industries. These results raise the question whether there are actually productivity gains from offshoring. Therefore, estimates of the impact of materials and business services offshoring on industry-level productivity in Belgium are presented. Two features of the analysis are new compared to the existing literature on this subject: the issue is examined separately for manufacturing and market services industries and the possibility of forward and backward spillovers from offshoring, i. e. that productivity gains from offshoring feed through to upstream and downstream industries, is investigated. Results show that materials offshoring has no effect on productivity, while business services offshoring leads to productivity gains in manufacturing. Furthermore, there is no evidence of either forward or backward spillovers from offshoring. Despite the absence of an industry-level total employment effect, offshoring may alter the within-industry composition of employment. In this respect, a major concern is the worsening of the labour market position of low-skilled workers. This issue is addressed by providing evidence on the impact of offshoring on the skill structure of manufacturing employment in Belgium between 1995 and 2007. Offshoring is found to significantly lower the employment share of low-skilled workers. Its contribution to the fall in the employment share of low-skilled workers amounts to 35 %. This is mainly driven by offshoring to Central and Eastern European countries. Business services offshoring also contributes significantly to the fall in the low-skilled employment share. As a complement to the existing literature, the widely used current price measure of offshoring is compared with a constant price measure that is based on a deflation with separate price indices for domestic output and imports. This reveals that the former underestimate the extent of offshoring and its impact on low-skilled employment. Finally, further results show that the impact of offshoring on low-skilled employment is significantly smaller in industries with a higher ICT capital intensity. Furthermore, attention is drawn to environmental effects of offshoring by asking whether offshoring contributes to reducing air emissions from manufacturing. Indeed, since the mid- 90 ’s, production-related air emissions in Belgian manufacturing have been reduced substantially. It can be shown that the pace of the reduction has been fastest for domestic intermediates. The issue of whether offshoring has played a role in this reduction by replacing domestic intermediates by imported intermediates is widely debated. Here, a decomposition analysis is developed to measure the contribution of offshoring – the share of imported intermediates in total intermediates – to the fall in air emissions for domestic intermediates. Based on the results from this decomposition analysis, it is possible to calculate that 17 % of the fall in greenhouse gas emissions, 6 % of the fall in <b>acidifying</b> <b>emissions</b> and 7 % of the fall in tropospheric precursor emissions in Belgian manufacturing between 1995 and 2007 can be attributed to offshoring. Finally, emission intensities are also considered as a potential determinant of offshoring. An econometric approach for testing the pollution haven effect for imported intermediate materials is developed. The approach is new with respect to the existing literature on pollution havens through its specific focus on imports of intermediates. The test is embedded in a cost function framework from which a system of cost share equations for variable input factors is derived. The set of potential determinants of the demand for imported intermediate materials includes emission intensities for three types of air pollutants. Their impact constitutes a test of the pollution haven effect. The system of cost share equations is estimated by a within ISUR using data for the Belgian manufacturing sector. Results show some albeit relatively weak evidence of a pollution haven effect for imported intermediate materials.
