[...] "The show was a lot like an '80s flashback, though to its credit Jackson's eight-piece band—bass, guitar, drums and percussion, two keyboardists and two backup singers—added some inventive layering to her older hits." [...] Charles Passy of the Palm Beach Post reported Jackson's show at the Coral Sky Amphitheatre emphasized style over substance, commenting her [...] "two-hour set was about half hormones—and half pyrotechnics. Without much in the way of a voice, she has sold her persona throughout her career. And as that persona has evolved from girlish teenager to sexually sophisticated woman, her albums—and tours—have provided a road map." [...] Jet Magazine reported, [...] "With wit, sass, dance <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> of sex appeal, Janet turns her song and dance fest into one of the major musical events of the year.
