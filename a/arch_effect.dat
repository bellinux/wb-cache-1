Using two models, the soil <b>arching</b> <b>effect</b> and horizontal unit by two theories of rigid retaining wall and non-linear soil pressure, combine with test material to calculate and analysis.

As the soil <b>arching</b> <b>effect</b> expresses in the lower part, its value is lower than horizontal unit model; both total soil pressure are the same; the resultant force point of the soil <b>arching</b> <b>effect</b> is higher than the horizontal unit model, the results of calculation and analyses are more well coincide to the virtual discipline. Basing on it, putting forward a kind of soil pressure calculation model which considers the space-time effect and reflects the soil pressure distribution is non-linear...|$|R

40|$|Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (<b>ARCH)</b> <b>effects</b> {{have been}} {{hypothesized}} {{to be caused}} by variations in the rate of information flow. Further, Nelson (1990, 1992) argues that <b>ARCH</b> <b>effects</b> and persistence in conditional variances should vary across sampling frequencies. However, these claims have not been subject to empirical tests on stock market data when the return interval is measured using intraday data. This paper presents such a test. The results support Nelson's claim that mis-specification in the conditional mean has only a small influence on the estimated conditional variance. Thus, mis-specified ARCH class models can be a consistent 'filter' if high frequency data are employed. At the microstructure level, the results are consistent with the view that <b>ARCH</b> <b>effects</b> are generated by variability in the rate of information arrival. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} examination is undertaken of Australian exchange rate data utilizing the ARCH family of models. Various econometric tests are performed {{in an attempt}} to identify the presence of <b>ARCH</b> <b>effects</b> in 21 daily Australian bilateral exchange rate series.

The presence of asymmetry in the <b>ARCH</b> <b>effects</b> is tested, although little evidence is found of any such asymmetry, as well as criteria for selecting an optimal ARCH model from among those fitted. The <b>ARCH</b> <b>effects</b> present in less frequently sampled data are thought to diminish and this is tested for using a number of indicators.

After eliminating outliers, DCA is able to identify two main axes: The first axis goes from dry to wet conditions, and the second axis from woodland to weed communities. This statistical technic is used to aviod the <b>arch</b> <b>effect,</b> which is a distortion or artifact in an ordination diagram, in which the second axis is an arched function of the first axis.|$|E

This dam {{is a central}} earth core dam with a height of 312 meters. A type of gravel soil stiffer than clay, which is made by artificial compounding of clay and gravel, is introduced to reduce the difference in displacement of earth core and rock filled shell zone. Because of the introduced less flexible central core, a more remarkable <b>arching</b> <b>effect</b> of the abutment on earth core might occur simultaneously.

The resulting scatterplot showed {{the form of a}} horse-shoe where the graves were arranged on the curve according to their chronological order. Similarly, a mapping of the component scores for the first two axes of the correspondence analysis result will display a parabola if the design styles considered are controlled by one factor only (like chronology). This is called the <b>arch</b> <b>effect</b> by Hill and Gauch (1980). Both Kendall and Jensen & Høilund Nielsen (1997) created artificial data sets to show that the parabola results in ideal circumstances.

50|$|Circa 1856, John Wind {{began work}} on Fair Oaks for Colonel Richard Mitchell, a hero of the War of 1812. Like Oak Lawn, the portico and balcony had {{projecting}} center sections. However, the pediment had a triangular window rather than a carved rosette. If the rosette was Wind's usual last signature, {{it could have been}} replaced with a window, because Wind died in 1863, perhaps before the house was completed. The entablature was complete, but had no dentil, resembling the Tuscan order. Fourteen-inch square pillars rather than fluted round columns were used. The balcony entablature was deeper than that of the portico, and the balcony pillars were attached by curved dropped sections on the entablature, creating an <b>arch</b> <b>effect</b> between the columns. These elements and the triangular window combine to give a somewhat Oriental touch to the appearance, again illustrating Wind's ability to elegantly abandon the Greek Revival with his own unique style. Fair Oaks burned to the ground in 1962. It was reconstructed with an identical exterior, except a carved acorn and oak leaves replaced the pediment window.|$|E

40|$|Engles ARCH {{test has}} become the {{standard}} test for <b>ARCH</b> <b>effects</b> in applied work. Under non-normality the true rejection probability of this test can differ substantially from the nominal level, however. Bootstrap and Monte Carlo versions of the test may then be used instead. This paper proposes an alternative test procedure. The new test exploits the empirical distribution of the data and an extended probability integral transformation. The test is compared with the former tests in Monte Carlo experiments. Under normality, the new test works {{as well as the}} conventional Monte Carlo test and the bootstrap. Under non-normality, the test tends to be more accurate and more powerful than the bootstrapped ARCH test. The procedure is then used to test for <b>ARCH</b> <b>effects</b> in S&P 500 returns sampled at different frequencies. In contrast to the standard and the bootstrapped ARCH tests, the new test detects <b>ARCH</b> <b>effects</b> in the transformed low-frequency returns. Copyright The Author 2008.

This paper proposes a method for two dimensional numerical simulation to perform three dimensional soil-pile interaction so that the slope angle can be considered even using a two dimensional numerical method.

Finally, in order to investigate the failure condition of a stabilizing pile enforced slope, DDA is applied. The results comparison between the example of FEM model and DDA model is conducted to verify the DDA application of solving the continuity problem. Then the failure of model is also analyzed by the simulation of DDA.
