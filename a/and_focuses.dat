Elements of the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII would later expand upon his character, detailing the character's history before and after the events of the original game.|$|E

40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the role of}} topic <b>and</b> <b>focus</b> in sentence processing, with particular attention to Hungarian. It is proposed that sentence topic <b>and</b> contrastive <b>focus</b> have a privileged relation to any prior discourse-related phrases, allowing them to influence the processing of the current sentence. The dissertation describes a series of experiments designed to test a distinction in processing of the discourse-related phrases topic <b>and</b> <b>focus</b> on the one hand, and non-discourse-related (background) constituents on the other. I argue that topic <b>and</b> <b>focus</b> receive discourse-interpretation during their initial processing; by contrast, elements in the background (other than inherently discourse-related ones) are incorporated into the discourse only after the entire proposition has been processed. This has important consequences for the types of information used by the parser when processing topic <b>and</b> <b>focus</b> vs. background. In particular, I propose that topic plays a distinguished role in constructing the contrast set for a contrastively focused item. ^ The privileged role of topic <b>and</b> <b>focus</b> is argued to follow from a syntactic property of Hungarian, namely, the structural marking of topic <b>and</b> <b>focus.</b> This allows the parser to identify the discourse-related status of topic <b>and</b> <b>focus</b> {{as soon as they}} are encountered. Immediate discourse interpretation of topic <b>and</b> <b>focus</b> is further related to the possibility of multiple filler-gap dependencies in Hungarian, which raises special issues in processing complexity and memory limitations. I examine some grammatical and parsing principles necessary to interpret simultaneous dependencies between two topics or wh-phrases and their traces. I propose that the parser constructs temporary memory buffers on the spot for each type of A'-dependency (topic, wh-phrase) separately, to help relieve the burden on immediate memory posed by a series of unassigned fillers. ...|$|R

5|$|Feminist {{theory is}} the {{extension}} of feminism into theoretical or philosophical fields. It encompasses work {{in a variety of}} disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, economics, women's studies, literary criticism, art history, psychoanalysis and philosophy. Feminist theory aims to understand gender inequality <b>and</b> <b>focuses</b> on gender politics, power relations, and sexuality. While providing a critique of these social and political relations, much of feminist theory also focuses on the promotion of women's rights and interests. Themes explored in feminist theory include discrimination, stereotyping, objectification (especially sexual objectification), oppression, and patriarchy.|$|E
5|$|Grey's Anatomy is an American {{television}} medical {{drama that}} debuted on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), as a mid-season replacement for Boston Legal on March 27, 2005.

The series has aired for thirteen seasons, <b>and</b> <b>focuses</b> on the fictional lives of surgical interns and residents, as they gradually evolve into seasoned doctors, while trying to maintain personal lives. The show's premise originated with Shonda Rhimes, who serves as an executive producer, along with Betsy Beers, Mark Gordon, Krista Vernoff, Rob Corn, Mark Wilding, and Allan Heinberg.

40|$|Adaptive optics {{systems can}} measure {{high-order}} aberrations using an artificial laser beacon {{without the need}} for a relatively bright object near the object being imaged. Unfortunately, tilt <b>and</b> <b>focus</b> measurements are difficult to obtain from a laser beacon. One solution is to use light from the object being imaged to measure tilt <b>and</b> <b>focus.</b> Through analysis, I estimate the performance of using a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor with 2 by 2 sub-apertures for measuring tilt <b>and</b> <b>focus.</b> Specifically, I discuss implementing this scheme for the sodium beacon adaptive optics upgrade to the Starfire Optical Range (SOR) 3. 5 m telescope. I use wave-optics simulation tools to evaluate the performance of the tilt <b>and</b> <b>focus</b> sensor in the SOR sodium beacon system. 1...|$|R

For common people to understand God's laws they {{had to be able to}} read the Bible, so schools were built in every parish and literacy rates grew rapidly, creating a Scottish-oriented market for books and writers.|$|E
