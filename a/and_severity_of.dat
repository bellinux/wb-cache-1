40|$|This study disentangled the {{frequency}} <b>and</b> perceived <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> experienced bullying <b>and</b> victimization by investigating their associations with {{cognitive and affective}} empathy. Participants were 800 children (7 – 12 years old) from third- to fifth-grade classrooms who completed self-report measures of {{the frequency}} <b>and</b> perceived <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> their bullying <b>and</b> victimization and of cognitive and affective empathy. Results showed that the frequency <b>and</b> perceived <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> bullying were moderately correlated in the entire sample but unrelated within the subsample of bullies. Frequency <b>and</b> perceived <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> victimization were significantly and positively correlated in the entire sample (moderate effect) and the subsample of victims (small effect). Frequent, but not severe, bullies reported less cognitive empathy than non-bullies whereas both frequent and severe victims reported more affective empathy than non-victims. Within subsamples of bullies and victims, frequency of bullying was negatively associated with cognitive and affective empathy, <b>and</b> perceived <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> bullying was positively associated with affective empathy.

5|$|Narcosis {{has been}} {{compared}} with altitude sickness regarding its variability of onset (though not its symptoms); its effects depend on many factors, with variations between individuals. Thermal cold, stress, heavy work, fatigue, and carbon dioxide retention all increase the risk <b>and</b> <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> narcosis. Carbon dioxide has a high narcotic potential and also causes increased {{blood flow to the}} brain, increasing the effects of other gases. Increased risk of narcosis results from increasing the amount of carbon dioxide retained through heavy exercise, shallow or skip breathing, or because of poor gas exchange in the lungs.|$|E

40|$|Background To {{determine}} whether a correlation exists between the clinical symptoms and signs <b>of</b> impingement, <b>and</b> the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> the lesions seen at bursoscopy. Methods Fifty-five patients who underwent arthroscopic subacromial decompression were analyzed. Pre-operatively patients completed an assessment form consisting of visual analogue pain score, and shoulder satisfaction. The degree of clinical impingement was also recorded. At arthroscopy impingement was classified according to the Copeland-Levy classification. Post-operatively the shoulder assessment was repeated. Statistical analysis was carried {{to determine if the}} degree of impingement at arthroscopy correlated with pre-operative pain, satisfaction and clinical signs of impingement. Results Pre-operative pain level, shoulder satisfaction and degree of clinical impingement did not correlate significantly with <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> the lesions of the acromion and cuff.

5|$|A rapid strep test may assist a {{clinician}} {{in deciding}} whether to prescribe an antibiotic to a person with pharyngitis, a common infection of the throat. Viral infections {{are responsible for the}} majority of pharyngitis, but a significant proportion (20% to 40% in children and 5% to 15% in adults) is caused by bacterial infection. The symptoms of viral and bacterial infection may be indistinguishable, but only bacterial pharyngitis can be effectively treated by antibiotics. Since the major cause of bacterial pharyngitis is GAS, the presence of this organism in a person's throat may be seen as a necessary condition for prescribing antibiotics. GAS pharyngitis is a self-limiting infection that will usually resolve within a week without medication. However, antibiotics may reduce the length <b>and</b> <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> the illness and reduce the risk of certain rare but serious complications.|$|E
