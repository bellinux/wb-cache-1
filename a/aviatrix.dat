They were war nurses, <b>aviatrixes,</b> girl detectives, counterspies, {{and animal}} skin-clad jungle queens, {{and they were}} in command. Guns blazing, daggers unsheathed, sword in hand, they leaped across the pages, ready to take on any villain. And they did not need rescuing.|$|R

50|$|Famed aviator Wiley Post twice {{used the}} field for record-breaking 'round-the-world flights, and {{developed}} or adapted technology (such as the Sperry autopilot) there to aid him. Famous <b>aviatrixes</b> of the era, such as Jackie Cochran, Laura Ingalls, and even Amelia Earhart broke records at this airfield. Howard Hughes also used Floyd Bennett Field as the start and finish of his July 1938 record-setting circumnavigation of the globe in ninety-one hours (as depicted in the 2004 film The Aviator). Media-savvy pilot Roscoe Turner was also a frequent visitor at this airfield, often in conjunction with record-breaking flights.|$|R
5000|$|Female costumed crimefighters {{were among}} the early comics characters. One of the comics' {{earliest}} female superheroes appeared in newspaper strips, the Invisible Scarlet O'Neil by Russell Stamm. The tough-fighting Miss Fury, debuted in the eponymous comic strip by female cartoonist Tarpé Mills in 1941. One publisher in particular, Fiction House, featured several progressive heroines such as the jungle queen Sheena, whose sex appeal is what helped launched her comic series. As Trina Robbins, in The Great Women Superheroes wrote: Most of House's pulp-style action stories either starred or featured strong, beautiful, competent heroines.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{creative}} six-hour non-fiction project has been the documentation of personal narratives (i. e., oral histories) of Huntington County pilots and <b>aviatrixes</b> who flew during the early to mid-twentieth century. Twenty profiles have been chronicled in alphabetical order. Types of flight experiences range from leisure, to military and private instruction, to cross-country trips, to wartime flight, and finally, {{to the work of}} an aerial photographer. From a local standpoint, regional aviation history has been documented. On a national scale, Huntington County aviation represents an era of flight occurring nationwide. By the inclusion of photographs, logbook entries, letters, journals, and poems a pictorial history reveals a depth of story that words alone can not convey. Each story in this project was read numerous times to the interviewee to ensure that names, quotes, dates, and facts were correct. Defining Flight documents a time period of aviation when men and women were adventurous, curious, daring, and willing to test the winds with kite-like machines. Department of EnglishThesis (M.

With Patricia's support, he persuades Lord Rawnsley to sponsor the race as a publicity stunt for his newspaper. Rawnsley, who takes full credit for the idea, announces the event to the press, shocking everyone with the amount of the prize.|$|E

5000|$|Most Gipsy Moths {{belonged to}} flying clubs, {{but after the}} Prince of Wales {{purchased}} a Gipsy Moth (G-AALG) for his own private flying, the aircraft became popular with high society. In addition the Moth was used for many record flights. The 'Lonely Flyer' Sir Francis Chichester flew his Gipsy Moth from England to Australia, further to New Zealand and then across the Pacific to Japan. Although he originally planned to fly around the Earth, a crash in Japan convinced him to switch to sailing. (Out of respect for his aircraft, he named his yachts 'Gipsy Moth II', 'Gipsy Moth III' and most famously 'Gipsy Moth IV'.) Of the <b>aviatrixes,</b> London secretary Amy Johnson flew her Gipsy Moth (G-AAAH [...] "Jason") 11,000 mi (17,703 km) to Australia and Jean Batten used a Gipsy Moth for her flights from England to India and England to Australia (the aircraft used to fly to India was G-AALG borrowed from Victor Dorée, who then owned the plane. In March 1928 Mary Bailey flew her Cirrus Moth solo from Croydon to Cape Town, a trip of three weeks, and returned the following year.|$|R

500|$|The Air Circus is Hawks's {{first film}} {{centered}} around aviation, {{one of his}} early passions. In 1928, Charles Lindbergh was the world's most famous person and Wings {{was one of the}} most popular films of the year. Wanting to capitalize on the country's aviation craze, Fox immediately bought Hawks's original story for The Air Circus, a variation of the male friendship plot of A Girl in Every Port about two young pilots. Officially, the original story is credited to Graham Baker and Andrew Bennison, while the screenplay was written by Seton Miller and Norman Z. McLeod. In the film, Arthur Lake and David Rollins play two eager young pilots at flight school who compete over their flight instructor's <b>aviatrix</b> sister, played by Sue Carol. The film was shot from April to June 1928, but Fox ordered an additional 15 minutes of dialogue footage in order that the film could compete with the new [...] "talkies" [...] being released. Hawks hated the new dialogue written by Hugh Herbert and he refused to participate in the re-shoots. The film was released in September 1928 and was a moderate hit. It is one of two films directed by Hawks that are lost films.|$|E

2500|$|But {{the thrill}} of stunt flying and the admiration of cheering crowds were only part of Coleman's dream. Coleman never lost sight of her {{childhood}} vow to one day [...] "amount to something." [...] As a professional <b>aviatrix,</b> Coleman would often be criticized by the press for her opportunistic nature and the flamboyant style she brought to her exhibition flying. However, she also quickly gained {{a reputation as a}} skilled and daring pilot who would stop at nothing to complete a difficult stunt. In Los Angeles she broke a leg and three ribs when her plane stalled and crashed on February 22, 1923.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Aviatrix</b> was {{the first}} Trance to the Sun studio album to contain {{acoustic}} drums.

Reflecting what their rehearsals were like for the album recording, the show featured a backing track with bass and keyboards but no vocals, which [...] "showcase the way our new songs sound live in their present, half realized state." [...] Island 13, a 5-song E.P. of re-recorded back catalog songs, was released on Bandcamp.com in December 2013 on Below Sea Level Recordings.|$|E

The <b>aviatrix</b> trophy depicts a winged goddess cradling a falcon with outstretched wings. The aeronaut trophy was lost in Germany between May 1940 and October 1953 and was {{believed to have been}} sold as scrap.
