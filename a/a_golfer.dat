5|$|As {{with the}} other majors, winning the Masters gives <b>a</b> <b>golfer</b> several {{privileges}} which make his career more secure. Masters champions are automatically invited {{to play in the}} other three majors (the U.S. Open, The Open Championship, and the PGA Championship) {{for the next five years}} (except for amateur winners, unless they turn pro within the five-year period), and earn a lifetime invitation to the Masters. They also receive membership on the PGA Tour for the following five seasons and invitations to The Players Championship for five years.|$|E

5|$|The tournament has {{a number}} of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, {{although}} it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. <b>A</b> <b>golfer</b> who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket). The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot {{on the morning of the}} first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, and Gary Player. Since 1960, a semi-social contest at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.|$|E

25|$|Oak Tree {{has been}} criticized for having a noose hang off of a tree {{to the left of the}} green on the par five sixteenth hole.

25|$|Anticipation is used {{to prepare}} the {{audience}} for an action, {{and to make the}} action appear more realistic. A dancer jumping off the floor has to bend the knees first; <b>a</b> <b>golfer</b> making a swing has to swing the club back first. The technique can also be used for less physical actions, such as a character looking off-screen to anticipate someone's arrival, or attention focusing on an object that a character is about to pick up.|$|E
25|$|It {{still stands}} among the {{greatest}} single {{seasons in the}} history of professional golf. Hogan, 40, was unable to enter—and possibly win—the 1953 PGA Championship (to complete the Grand Slam) because its play (July 1–7) overlapped the play of the British Open at Carnoustie (July 6–10), which he won. It was the only time that <b>a</b> <b>golfer</b> had won three major professional championships in a year until Tiger Woods won the final three majors in 2000 (and the first in 2001).|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} April, Woods won {{his first}} major, The Masters, with a record score of 18-under-par 270, by a record margin of 12 strokes. The landmark victory made Woods the tournament's youngest-ever winner, {{as well as its}} first African-American winner (and its first Asian-American winner). Woods set 20 Masters records in 1997 and tied six others. He went on to win another three PGA Tour events that year, and on June 15, 1997, in only his 42nd week as a professional, rose to number one in the Official World Golf Ranking, the fastest-ever ascent to world No. 1. At the conclusion of the 1997 season, Woods was named PGA Player of the Year, the first time <b>a</b> <b>golfer</b> had won the award in just his second year as a professional.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>golfer's</b> net {{score is}} {{determined}} by subtracting the player's handicap from the gross score (the number of strokes actually taken). The net scores of all the competing golfers are compared and (generally) {{the person with the}} lowest score wins.|$|R

25|$|A lost ball or a ball hit out {{of bounds}} result in a penalty of one stroke and {{distance}} (Rule 27–1). A one-stroke penalty is assessed if a player's equipment causes the ball to move or the removal of a loose impediment causes the ball to move (Rule 18–2). A one-stroke penalty is assessed if a player's ball results into a red or yellow staked hazard (Rule 26). If <b>a</b> <b>golfer</b> makes a stroke at the wrong ball (Rule 19–2) or hits a fellow golfer's ball with a putt (Rule 19–5), the player incurs a two-stroke penalty. Most rule infractions lead to stroke penalties but also can lead to disqualification. Disqualification could be from cheating, signing for a lower score, or from rule infractions that lead to improper play.|$|E
25|$|The tee {{shots on}} Holes 1, 3, 8, 15 and 17 are blind, {{and there are}} several blind {{approach}} shots on Holes 2, 6 and 14. The second and third shots at Hole 9 are blind, depending on length. There also are several holes that are semi-blind; the surface of the green cannot be seen when playing approach shots on Holes 5, 10, 18, and on 15 (for the long hitter). These blind shots are only blind once. Still, they do make Wykagyl difficult to play for <b>a</b> <b>golfer</b> who has never seen it before. Wykagyl is unique in its mix of par threes, par fours and par fives. Most 18-hole courses have four par threes, four par fives and ten par fours, but Wykagyl has five par fives, five par threes and eight par fours.|$|E
500|$|Par is a {{predetermined}} number of strokes that <b>a</b> <b>golfer</b> should require {{to complete a}} hole, a round (the sum of the total pars of the played holes), or a tournament (the sum of the total pars of each round).
