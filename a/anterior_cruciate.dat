40|$|Thirty {{cruciate}} ligaments were {{retrieved from}} eithercadavers or limbs {{which had been}} amputated. Each specimen was sectioned and stained to demonstrate the presence of collagen, nerves and vessels. All 30 specimens contained an interconnecting band of collagen fibres between the <b>anterior</b> and posterior <b>cruciate</b> ligaments. Vascular structures were present in all specimens and nerve fibres were identified in 26 (86 %). We have called this structure the ‘intercruciate band’. The <b>anterior</b> and posterior <b>cruciate</b> ligaments should no longer be thought of in isolation, but together as a ‘cruciate complex’...|$|R
5|$|Fowler's {{performance}} in the 1997–98 football season was marred by an <b>anterior</b> <b>cruciate</b> (knee) ligament injury that {{kept him out of}} action for half the season and caused him to miss the 1998 World Cup. During this period of injury, fellow Liverpool striker, Michael Owen rose to prominence, making his debut in 1997. Owen established himself in the Liverpool team in Fowler's absence.|$|E

5|$|During {{the end of}} {{his final}} season at Vicenza, Baggio {{shattered}} both the <b>anterior</b> <b>cruciate</b> ligament (ACL) and the meniscus of his right knee while playing against Rimini on 5 May 1985, while attempting a slide tackle. The injury occurred two days before his official transfer deal to Fiorentina had been finalised, and it seriously threatened his career, at age 18. Although several team doctors feared he would not play again, Fiorentina retained their faith in him, agreeing to commit to the transfer as well as fund the required surgery, one of many reasons for Baggio's attachment to the club.|$|E
50|$|On 14 January 2009, {{during the}} Bundesliga's winter break, Ibišević {{was injured in}} a {{training}} match against Hamburger SV in Spain. The final examination confirmed an <b>anterior</b> right <b>cruciate</b> ligament rupture, which took him out of action {{for the rest of}} the 2008-09 season. He returned at the beginning of the 2009-10 season. He was scoreless until Hoffenheim's seventh Bundesliga match, when he scored a hat-trick against Hertha BSC in a remarkable comeback. This became the second-fastest hat-trick in Bundesliga history and the fastest goal scored this season, scored 47 seconds into the match. After the season, he signed a contract extension that would have kept him at Hoffenheim until the end of the 2012-13 season.|$|R
50|$|Between the {{articular}} facets in the intercondylar area, but {{nearer the}} posterior than the anterior {{aspect of the}} bone, is the intercondyloid eminence (spine of tibia), surmounted on either side by a prominent tubercle, on {{to the sides of}} which the articular facets are prolonged; in front of and behind the intercondyloid eminence are rough depressions for the attachment of the <b>anterior</b> and posterior <b>cruciate</b> ligaments and the menisci.|$|R

40|$|A {{model of}} the knee in the {{sagittal}} plane was used to investigate the ligament forces resulting when an external load applied to the tibia resisted either extension or flexion of the knee under increasing isometric quadriceps or hamstrings contractions, respectively. An elementary mechanical analysis showed which ligament, the <b>anterior</b> or posterior <b>cruciate,</b> was loaded at a given flexion angle and known line of action of the external load. Ligament force, {{as a proportion of}} the external load, was also calculated. The results serve as guidelines for the design of injury-specific physical therapy techniques for use after cruciate ligament reconstruction...|$|R
