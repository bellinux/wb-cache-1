40|$|Species {{distributional}} limits may {{coincide with}} hard dispersal barriers or physiological thresholds along environmental gradients, {{but they may}} also be influenced by species interactions. We explore a number of models of interspecific interactions that lead to (sometimes <b>abrupt)</b> <b>distribution</b> limits in the presence and absence of environmental gradients. We find that gradients in competitive ability can lead to spatial segregation of competitors into distinct ranges, but that spatial movement tends to broaden the region of sympatry between the two species, and that Allee effects tend to sharpen these boundaries. We generalize these simple models to include metapopulation dynamics and other types of interactions including predator/prey and host-parasite interactions. We derive conditions for range limits in each case. We also consider models that include coevolution and gene flow and find that character displacement along environmental gradients can lead to stable parapatric distributions. We conclude that it is essential to consider coevolved species interactions as a potential mechanism limiting species distributions, particularly when barriers to dispersal are weak and environmental gradients are gradual...|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{tracking}} {{solutions are}} not feasi-ble in handling abrupt motion {{as they are}} based on smooth motion assumption or constrained motion model; where the motion is often governed by a fixed Gaussian <b>distribution.</b> <b>Abrupt</b> motion however, is not subjected to motion continuity and smoothness. To assuage this, we propose a novel abrupt motion tracker that is based on swarm intelligence- the SwA-Track. Unlike existing swarm-based filtering methods, we firstly introduce an optimised swarm-based sampling strategy to enrich the trade-o ↵ between the exploration and exploitation of the search space in search for the optimal proposal distribution. Secondly, we propose adaptive acceleration parameters to allow on the fly tuning of the best mean and variance of the distribution for sampling. The adaptive strategy requires no train-ing stage thus allowing flexibility in the motion model, while relaxing the number of particles deployed. Exper-imental results in both the quantitative and qualitative measures demonstrate the e↵ectiveness of the proposed method in tracking abrupt motions. ...|$|R

This thesis {{is devoted to}} the pursuit of topics involving the development of these materials for TFT applications: Deposition of zinc oxide and zinc tin oxide semiconductor layers via reactive sputtering from a metal target, and the characterization of indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) -based TFTs utilizing various insulator materials as the gate dielectric. The first topic involves the deposition of oxide semiconductor layers via reactive sputtering from a metal target. Two oxide semiconductors are utilized for fabricating TFTs via reactive sputtering from a metal target: zinc oxide and zinc tin oxide. With optimized processing parameters, zinc oxide and zinc tin oxide via this deposition method exhibit similar characteristics to TFTs fabricated via sputtering from a ceramic target. Additionally the effects of gate capacitance density and gate dielectric material are explored utilizing TFTs with IGZO as the semiconductor layers. IGZO-based TFTs exhibit ideal behavior with improved TFT performance such as higher current drive at a given overvoltage, a decrease in the subthreshold swing, and a decrease in the magnitude of the turn-on voltage. Additionally it is shown that silicon dioxide is the preferred dielectric material, with silicon nitride a poor choice for oxide-based TFTs. Finally a simple method to characterize the band tail state distribution near the conduction band minimum of a semiconductor by analyzing two-terminal current-voltage characteristics of a TFT with a floating gate is presented. The characteristics trap energy (E[subscript T]) as a function of post-deposition annealing temperature is shown to correlate very well with IGZO TFT performance, with a lower value of E[subscript T], corresponding to a more <b>abrupt</b> <b>distribution</b> of band tail states, correlating with improved TFT mobility. It is shown that as the post-deposition anneal temperature increases, the total number of band tail states does not change significantly, however the energy distribution of these states approaches that of a crystalline material...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} autecology of the New Zealand endemic shrub epiphyte Pittosporum kirkii (Pittosporaceae). Pittosporum kirkii most frequently displays an epiphytic lifestyle, perched amongst nest epiphytes in the canopies of emergent or canopy trees in old-growth forest. The main {{objective of this}} research was to enhance the understanding of Pittosporum kirkii, with a focus on ecological, morphological and physiological characteristics. Ecological characteristics were investigated in field surveys of five key Pittosporum kirkii populations that encompass its known latitudinal extent. Survey results showed that P. kirkii is late successional epiphyte commonly found in the inner crown of large canopy and emergent hosts amongst nest epiphytes, it has a short flowering season and shows clinal patterns in leaf length with increasing latitude. Pittosporum kirkii meets the definition of a facultative epiphyte as it grows in rupestral, terrestrial and epiphytic lifestyles. The most common host species for P. kirkii is Dacrydium cupressinum. Flowering was concentrated between November and December and individuals in the populations examined were functionally dioecious with a preponderance of males; flower pollinators and seed dispersers are uncertain. Field data and supplementary data sets (e. g. herbarium records) were combined to develop a predicted environmental distribution map. Pittosporum kirkii has an <b>abrupt</b> <b>distribution</b> with strong habitat preferences restricting it to the upper North Island, in upper lowland and lower montane old-growth forest ecosystems. High vapour pressure deficits (> 0. 39 kPa) and low annual rainfall (< 1172 mm) restrict environmental distribution. Investigations into the physiological and morphological characteristics of Pittosporum kirkii were focussed on water relations because water availability is speculated to be the most limiting factor across all of the habitats that P. kirkii occupies. In a glasshouse experiment P. kirkii seedlings were subjected to three levels of desiccation stress alongside epiphytic congener P. cornifolium. In the context of international literature, the stress strategies of each species were identified from analysis of morphological adaptations and physiological responses. Pittosporum kirkii has small relative leaf area, thick coriaceous upper leaf cuticles, substantial hypodermal tissue, and under desiccation stress, exhibited rapid reductions in stomatal conductance and photosynthetic activity with stress (ceased function at mean pre-dawn water potentials of - 0. 8 MPa). This evidence aligns P. kirkii with a desiccation postponement strategy. In contrast P. cornifolium has thinner cuticle hypodermal tissue, larger relative leaf area and maintains photosynthetic function under greater stress (ceased function at mean pre-dawn water potentials of - 1. 7 MPa), and as a result, lost water potential faster than P. kirkii. Therefore P. cornifolium is concluded to align with a desiccation tolerance stress strategy. Both species recovered within 3 days after re-watering, an important response for the drought-prone epiphytic, terrestrial and rupestral environments that both species inhabit. Under the current threat classification Pittosporum kirkii is listed as in decline and {{is considered to be a}} data poor species. The threats to this species are uncertain; although possum browsing and forest clearance have been proposed, all available evidence is anecdotal and circumstantial. The abundant presence of P. kirkii on possum-free Great Barrier Island suggests relief from possum browse but other browsers are also restricted. Regenerative failures were not evident in mainland or offshore island populations and possum herbivory was not detected in mainland populations, likely because numbers were controlled. However, there may be other factors that may be potentially causing the decline of P. kirkii which could be identified with further research into pollinators, seed dispersal and sexual expression. Pittosporum kirkii then is a distinctive member of New Zealand’s small guild of endemic shrub epiphytes but overall has the narrowest distribution, narrowest environmental profile, greatest habitat specificity and is the least abundant.

40|$|Background: Although in the {{majority}} of melanomas {{there is no evidence of}} pre-existing melanocytic nevus, it is believed that malignant transformation may sometimes occur within a benign precursor. Objectives: We sought to describe the morphologic features of de novo melanoma and melanoma arising from nevi by means of in vivo confocal microscopy, and to correlate them with their corresponding histopathologic features. Methods: A total of 113 consecutive, histopathologically proven melanoma cases, 33 arising from a nevus and 80 occurring de novo, were imaged by confocal microscopy and retrospectively evaluated. Cyto-architectural features preferentially expressed in melanomas arising from nevi and in de novo melanomas were defined. Results: By confocal microscopy, <b>abrupt</b> transition, localized <b>distribution</b> of junctional atypical cells, and the presence of dense dermal nests were the most helpful criteria for categorizing a melanoma as arising from a nevus. Melanomas arising from common and congenital nevi were predominantly composed of roundish, monomorphous cells, whereas melanomas arising either de novo or from dysplastic nevi were characterized by markedly pleomorphic cells. Limitations: The study is retrospective. Conclusion: Confocal microscopy is effective in identifying melanoma even when a nevus is simultaneously present, confirming the clinical usefulness of this methodology. Moreover, distinctive features were observed in de novo melanomas and melanomas arising from nevi, permitting accurate distinction between the two groups. Finally, differences in cell morphology, easily detectable by confocal microscopy, seemed to characterize different melanoma types. © 2010 by the American Academy of Dermatology, Inc...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{proposed}} {{to examine the}} relation between angiographic morphologic characteristics and abrupt closure after coronary angioplasty and to develop an empirically based risk stratification system. Background. Certain lesion morphologic characteristics are associated with higher rates of abrupt closure after coronary angioplasty. Previous approaches have been limited by relatively small sample sizes and an inability to combine multiple characteristics to predict risk in an individual patient. Methods. Lesion morphology was determined for 779 lesions in 658 patients undergoing an elective first angioplasty. Abrupt closure occurred in 63 lesions (8. 1 %). Variables associated with abrupt closure were identified by univariate and stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis, and internal validity was assessed by use of bootstrapping. An empirically based scoring system was developed by assigning diferent weights to each predictive characteristic and was then validated. Results. Almost all lesion characteristics previously labeled “adverse” were {{associated with an increased}} risk of abrupt closure, but only total occlusion, location at a branch point, increasing lesion length, evidence for thrombus and right coronary artery location were statistically significant independent predictors. Despite the large sample size, the study was underpowered to detect even a 50 % increase in risk with many characteristics. Using a scoring system, we assigned each lesion a specific risk of <b>abrupt</b> closure. The <b>distribution</b> of risk was broad, with 20 % of patients having ≤ 2. 5 % risk and 25 % having > 10 % risk. Internal validation techniques revealed that when 10 % of patients were randomly eliminated from the sample in multiple iterations, the risk estimates varied, again pointing to the need for a larger sample. Conclusions. Empirically based weighting of lesion characteristics could quantify the risk of abrupt closure for individual patients, but a very large sample will be required to understand the interplay of complex lesion characteristics in altering expected outcomes...|$|R
