25|$|Armstrong's {{theory of}} {{universals}} {{gives him the}} basis for an understanding of laws of nature as being relations between universals, a non-Humean account of laws of nature proposed independently by Armstrong, Michael Tooley, and Fred Dretske. This account posits that the relations between universals are truthmakers for the statements about physical laws, and it is realist as it accepts that laws of nature are {{a feature of the}} world rather than just <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> talk about the world. Armstrong identifies the laws as holding between universals rather than particulars as an account of laws involving just particulars rather than universals would not adequately explain how laws of nature operate in the case of counterfactuals.|$|E

When questioned about his views on life after death, {{he wrote in his}} 1905 autobiography, As to the future state, the teachings of our tribe were not specific, that is, we had no definite idea of our relations and surroundings in after life. We believed that there is a life after this one, but no one ever told me as to what part of man lived after death... We held that the discharge of one's duty would make his future life more pleasant, but whether that future life was worse than this life or better, we did not know, and no one was able to tell us. We hoped that in the future life, family and tribal relations would be resumed. In <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> believed this, but we did not know it.|$|E

500|$|.....it {{was one of}} {{the most}} freshly funny and crisply {{innovative}} comedies for years. The humour was all based in the character, not the situation. The story lines were negligible; there were no catch phrases; it was surreal in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> hadn't seen since Monty Python; and the cast were actors being funny from inside a characterisation, not stand-up comics bolting a cartoon persona onto the back of gags." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the use of}} MotionScan was {{critically}} acclaimed for its highly realistic capture of faces, it was criticised for its inability to capture body movements. Many players considered that characters are [...] "dead from the neck down". Game director Brendan McNamara attributed this to players' expectations of realism; [...] "people expect to see clothes moving {{and the rest of}} the body moving in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> can't replicate in video games," [...] he said. [...] "We would have loved to have spent more time on fine-tuning that for L.A. Noire but it wasn't feasible due to the scope of the scripting and talent involved," [...] said Bao.|$|E

[...] "We knew we were making this movie for a contemporary audience and we wanted Rapunzel to be a real role model in <b>a</b> <b>way.</b> <b>We</b> wanted all this girl power and to really drive this story, so she doesn't wait around for anything ... she's a smart girl, she has these hopes and dreams and she's going to get what she wants out of life."

500|$|On August 28, 1974, Louis Peraino of Bryanston {{agreed to}} {{distribute}} the film worldwide, from which Bozman and Skaaren would receive $225,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted) and 35% of the profits. Years later Bozman stated, [...] "We {{made a deal with}} the devil, , and I guess that, in <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>we</b> got what we deserved." [...] They signed the contract with Bryanston and, after the investors recouped their money (with interest),—and after Skaaren, the lawyers, and the accountants were paid—only $8,100 (about $ inflation-adjustedn) was left to be divided among the 20 cast and crew members. Eventually the producers sued Bryanston for failing to pay them their full percentage of the box office profits. A court judgment instructed Bryanston to pay the filmmakers $500,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted), but by then the company had declared bankruptcy. In 1983 New Line Cinema acquired the distribution rights from Bryanston and gave the producers a larger share of the profits.|$|E
500|$|The German word [...] "Achtung" [...] (...) in {{the album}} title {{translates}} into English as [...] "attention" [...] or [...] "watch out". U2's sound engineer Joe O'Herlihy {{used the phrase}} [...] "achtung baby" [...] during recording, reportedly taking it from the Mel Brooks film The Producers. The title was selected in August 1991 {{near the end of}} the album sessions. According to Bono, it was an ideal title, as it was attention-grabbing, referenced Germany, and hinted at either romance or birth, both of which were themes on the album. The band was determined not to highlight the seriousness of the lyrics and instead sought to [...] "erect a mask", a concept that was further developed on the Zoo TV Tour, particularly through characters such as [...] "The Fly". Of the title, Bono said in 1992, [...] "It's a con, in <b>a</b> <b>way.</b> <b>We</b> call it Achtung Baby, grinning up our sleeves in all the photography. But it's probably the heaviest record we've ever made... It tells you a lot about packaging, because the press would have killed us if we'd called it anything else." ...|$|E
500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} that accused the character's bodies of being lifeless, despite the game's use of motion capture, Brendan McNamara, the game's director and writer, stated {{in an interview}} with Eurogamer, [...] "People were saying people were dead from the neck down. That's because we had all this animation in the neck and all this animation in the face, but the clothes don't move. Once you get to the level that people can actually see that level of realism, then people expect to see clothes moving {{and the rest of the}} body moving in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> can't replicate in video games." [...] In the same interview McNamara also responded to queries about why Phelps sometimes responds with particularly aggressive lines of dialogue during interrogation scenes. [...] "It's funny. A lot of people say Aaron turns into a psycho. When we originally wrote the game the questions you asked were coax, force and lie. It was actually force because it was a more aggressive answer. That's the way we recorded it. But when the game came out it was truth, doubt or lie. Everyone always says Aaron on the second question is a psycho. So that's not his fault." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Constant" [...] is {{the second}} Lost episode to deal {{directly}} {{with the concept of}} time travel after [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes" [...] from the third season. [...] While promoting that episode, Lindelof said that it uses the flashback device [...] "in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> never have before and never will again" [...] and while promoting [...] "The Constant", he said that it [...] "upholds that pledge, unpledges it, then repledges it." [...] Losts writer-producers enjoy science fiction themes such as time travel; however, they were careful not to create a paradox. [...] The rules for time-travel in the series are outlined in [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes"—although, Lindelof has said that [...] "The Constant" [...] is a more important episode in terms of explaining time travel on the show—by Ms. Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan), who explains that certain events are inevitable and the universe will eventually correct any errors. [...] Had these rules not been established, the writers feared that viewers would lose interest because the stakes of the characters would be lessened. [...] The writers hoped that [...] "The Constant" [...] would further establish that there are no parallel universes or alternate realities. [...] Lindelof reminisced that [...] "just breaking that episode was such a massive headache" [...] and Cuse added that [...] "it was definitely like doing the hardest New York Times crossword puzzle for the week".|$|E
500|$|Apart from {{a change}} in musical style, the band changed the way they recorded. [...] "It {{was the first time}} we sort of jammed," [...] Coxon revealed. [...] "We've never really jammed before. We've been quite white-coaty, overall about recording, like in a laboratory. Yeah, we did {{actually}} feel our way through just playing whatever came to our minds and editing, which was really exciting." [...] "We just played together for two weeks in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> hadn't done since 1991," [...] Dave recalls. [...] "We wanted to purify the sound, to not have anything there not played by us. We reasoned that if we made small changes at the input end, we could effect large changes in the output." [...] According to producer Stephen Street, [...] "Blur had decided that commercial pressures and writing hit singles wasn't going to be the main consideration any more. The mood in the studio was very different to when I'd first worked with them." [...] "In the studio, once we got past those first few days, where I felt everyone was treading on eggshells, there was a great atmosphere. I think it was because they didn't want to be competing with anyone on this record, they wanted to make a record that would help keep the band together." [...] Street had acquired a new piece of hardware, described as [...] "muso-ish to talk about but really useful" [...] which enabled him to sample loops and otherwise cut-and-paste entire sections of the band's jam sessions.|$|E
500|$|Patrick W. Galbraith of Otaku2.com {{compared}} {{the design of}} OZ to Takashi Murakami's artwork, specifically [...] "the flatness, or slick, polished surfaces" [...] and then contrasted them with the sequences in Nagano noting, [...] "it has a warm and lived in feel to it, aided by a scrupulous attention to detail." [...] Of the story and characters Galbraith wrote that [...] "scenes such as the large family coming together and talking over dinner are heartwarming and hilarious." [...] and {{compared the}} movie to [...] "a moving picture book, a family photo album turned back a few decades." [...] He also noted the audience response, reporting sold-out screenings two nights in a row, and highlighting handwritten notes left at the theater by [...] "hoardes of fans who on the spot {{decided to move to}} Nagano" [...] In conclusion, Galbraith wrote [...] "there is an innocence and purity to this work that really reminds [...] of Miyazaki Hayao and Studio Ghibli back in the day, and the stellar backgrounds invoke Shinkai Makoto." [...] Justin Sevakis of Anime News Network gave the film an 'A' rating and wrote that [...] "decades from now, Summer Wars will be seen as the official arrival of [...] Mamoru Hosoda into the realm of historically important anime directors." [...] He called the film [...] "a near-perfect blend of social satire and science fiction, at once timely and timeless, sardonic and optimistic." [...] and noted that the film is [...] "practically overflowing with sharp social insight in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> have not seen from anime in years." [...] Sevakis praised Yoshiyuki Sadamoto's character designs and highlighted the visuals as [...] "sharp and consistently great". In summing the film up he called Summer Wars [...] "Incredibly entertaining, and intriguingly intelligent. Accessible and fast-paced. Pretty much perfect." [...] Similarities have been commented on between the film and a previous work of Hosoda, [...] Neo magazine has stated that Our War Game is [...] "plainly a prototype" [...] of Summer Wars.|$|E
