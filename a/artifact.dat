5|$|<b>Artifact</b> premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival on September 15. It {{was later}} {{screened}} on November 8, 2012 {{at the opening}} night of the DOC NYC, a New York City documentary festival. In November 2012, {{it was announced that}} The Works International had picked up international sales for the film. On November 26, 2012, <b>Artifact</b> received the Audience Award at the 22nd Gotham Independent Film Awards. On March 13, 2013, the film was screened at the South by Southwest. It also appeared at the Melbourne International Film Festival on August 9, 2013. Thirty Seconds to Mars held a special screening of <b>Artifact</b> on August 31, 2013 on the online platform VyRT.|$|E
5|$|On a {{beach in}} CÃ´te d'Ivoire, a {{metallic}} <b>artifact</b> with inscriptions is discovered by Solomon Merkmallen, a biology professor. When he takes it to his office and places it together with a similar <b>artifact,</b> the two suddenly fuse and fly across the room, becoming embedded in a Bible. Merkmallen then travels to the U.S. to meet with Steven Sandoz, an American University biologist who has a third <b>artifact.</b> However, he is murdered by a man posing as Sandoz; when the real Sandoz finds the body, he flees.|$|E
5|$|A {{conservative}} {{force that}} acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms. This means {{that for a}} closed system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can {{be considered to be}} an <b>artifact</b> of the potential field {{in the same way that}} the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an <b>artifact</b> of the contour map of the elevation of an area.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artifacts</b> are the {{physical}} entities that are deployed on Nodes (ie. Devices and Execution Environments).

5|$|After {{collecting}} more <b>artifact</b> pieces, Raynor's forces encounter Dominion battleships at the pre-agreed Moebius Foundation rendezvous point. The Moebius Foundation {{is revealed}} {{to be under the}} control of Valerian Mengsk, Arcturus' son. Valerian, intending to show himself as a worthy successor to his father, asks Raynor to help him invade Char and use the <b>artifact</b> to restore Kerrigan's humanity, thus weakening the Zerg. To the initial dismay of the crew, Raynor agrees. With Valerian's aid, Raynor recovers the final <b>artifact</b> piece, and the Raiders and Dominion invade Char. The Dominion fleet is devastated by the heavy Zerg defenses, but Raynor secures a foothold on Char and rendezvouses with Dominion forces led by Horace Warfield, a decorated Dominion general. Warfield is later injured and appoints Raynor commander of surviving Dominion forces as well. The combined forces of the Raiders and Dominion military push towards the main Hive Cluster of the planet, protecting the <b>artifact</b> as it charges to full power, and the <b>artifact</b> eventually destroys all Zerg within its blast radius. Raynor's team finds Kerrigan restored to human form; however, Tychus reveals that he made a deal with Arcturus Mengsk, trading Kerrigan's life for his own freedom. Raynor defends Kerrigan from Tychus' attempt to kill her, fatally shooting Tychus in the process. The closing scene shows Raynor carrying Sarah Kerrigan out of the main hive in his arms.|$|E
5|$|<b>Artifact</b> is a 2012 American {{documentary}} film. It {{was directed}} by Jared Leto under the pseudonym of Bartholomew Cubbins, and produced by Leto and Emma Ludbrook. <b>Artifact</b> chronicles the modern music business as it charts the legal dispute between Leto's rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars and record label EMI, which filed a $30 million breach of contract lawsuit against them in 2008, after the band tried to exit its contract over a royalties dispute. Thirty Seconds to Mars is shown working with producer Flood to create the 2009 album This Is War, meeting with lawyers between recording sessions.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014 the {{kilogram}} was {{the only}} SI unit still defined by an <b>artifact.</b> In 1960 the metre having previously also been defined by reference to an <b>artifact</b> (a single platinum-iridium bar with two marks on it) was redefined in terms of invariant, fundamental physical constants (the wavelength of a particular emission of light emitted by krypton, and later the speed of light) so that the standard can be reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification. At the 94th Meeting of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) (2005) it was recommended that the same {{be done with the}} kilogram.|$|E
40|$|In April 2005 {{screening}} {{with digital}} mammography was {{allowed in the}} Flemish part of Belgium. A rigorous physical-technical Quality Control (QC) procedure based on the European guidelines (EUREF) was then implemented. Besides quality control, there is also quality assurance (QA). Detection of <b>artifacts</b> {{is part of the}} QA. During the central second reading, a continuous evaluation of the image quality is done. All visible <b>artifacts</b> in the digital images are registered and collected. All systems participate also in a daily quality control, with a daily exposure of a phantom image which is sent to the certified quality control group. The collected <b>artifacts</b> were divided into 5 different categories: patient related <b>artifacts,</b> technologist related <b>artifacts,</b> mammography unit related <b>artifacts,</b> processing related <b>artifacts</b> and viewing conditions related <b>artifacts.</b> Patient related <b>artifacts</b> are comparable with film screen mammography (FSM) and are therefore not discussed. One of the main <b>artifacts</b> in the group of technologist related <b>artifacts</b> is dust in the cassette of computed radiography (CR) systems. In the group of mammography unit related <b>artifacts</b> a distinction is made between the <b>artifacts</b> of CR systems and direct radiography (DR) systems. In the CR group, the <b>artifacts</b> originate in the reader, whereas in the DR group they originate in the detector, which in our study was a Selenium detector. <b>Artifacts</b> due to failure of the Selenium detector are most frequent in this last group. Processing related <b>artifacts</b> are found when the reading of the processing algorithm by the system or by the PACS software made mistakes. Because there is a daily quality control of the monitors of the soft copy work stations, we didn't recognize viewing conditions related <b>artifacts.</b> Some of the <b>artifacts</b> can simulate breast lesions or can disturb the reading of the images. In order to avoid misinterpretation, recognizing <b>artifacts</b> and understanding their physical-technical background are of great importance in digital breast imaging. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Catherine Halsey {{is brought}} to Infinity due to her {{knowledge}} of Forerunner technology. She is kept under guard by marines and Spartans including Gabriel Thorne, who lost his family during the Didact's attack on New Phoenix. While studying the <b>artifact,</b> Halsey begins receiving messages on her computer from an anonymous sender. The source of the transmissions is 'Mdama, who captures Glassman and forces him {{to work on a}} Forerunner device that supposedly contains the Librarian. Pursuing 'Mdama's troops, Crimson Squad recovers another <b>artifact.</b> When Halsey examines the device, it displays images Thorne recognizes as depicting New Phoenix. Lasky reveals to Halsey and the Spartans that the UNSC knows Prometheans are former humans. Approaching the <b>artifact</b> looking for answers, Thorne is teleported to Requiem and captured by Covenant. Palmer arrests Halsey for communicating with 'Mdama. Thorne escapes captivity outside 'Mdama's base, and escapes with Glassman; they are rescued by Majestic Squad.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, the player must acquire twelve Artifacts, which are prizes that are awarded after {{completing}} objectives such as winning minigames or beating bosses. Once having acquired twelve Artifacts, the player is granted access to a table called the <b>Artifact</b> Temple, which places six balls on the table at the same time. To complete the table, twelve different targets must be hit with the balls while they are bombarded by attacks from Meta Ridley, one of the antagonists of the Metroid Prime series. If all of the balls are lost, the table ends; the player does not lose any of the twelve Artifacts already collected but is forced to revisit another table and complete it before being allowed a second attempt at the <b>Artifact</b> Temple. Upon completing the <b>Artifact</b> Temple, access is granted to the final table, Impact Crater. After the player defeats the Metroid Prime creature on the Impact Crater table, the game unlocks a higher difficulty level, Expert mode.|$|E
5|$|Eventually accumulating all the artifacts, the Raiders {{discover}} that the Moebius Foundation is a front for the heir apparent of the Dominion, Valerian Mengsk; though the Hyperion crew is concerned about having been working for their enemy, Valerian coaxes Raynor to accompany him in invading Char as the combined <b>artifact</b> may reverse Kerrigan's infestation. Although the Dominion takes heavy losses to the Zerg, the Raiders defend the <b>artifact</b> from Kerrigan until it can be activated; upon detonating, it destroys all nearby Zerg and leaves Kerrigan human again. However, Findlay, acting on orders from Arcturus Mengsk, attempts to kill the weakened Kerrigan, forcing Raynor to kill Findlay before tending to Kerrigan.|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} {{explores the}} artificiality of human <b>artifacts.</b> To talk of <b>artifacts,</b> we must avoid ontologizing. Ontology ignores human participation in its construction and describing <b>artifacts</b> {{as if their}} descriptions {{had nothing to do}} with it contradicts the idea of their artificiality. Instead, I will explore the nature of <b>artifacts</b> from the perspective of human-centered design and with culture-sensitive conceptions in mind. Exploring <b>artifacts</b> from this perspective offers scholars and practitioners a fascinating field of inquiry.

5|$|Four years later, in Wings of Liberty, Kerrigan and the Zerg {{suddenly}} vanish {{from the}} Koprulu Sector, allowing the Protoss {{to once again}} take on a passive role in the galaxy. Meanwhile, Raynor forms a revolutionary group named Raynor's Raiders in order to overthrow Mengsk. On Mar Sara, Raynor liberates the local population from Dominion control and also discovers a component of a mysterious Xel'Naga <b>artifact.</b> The Zerg suddenly reappear and overrun Mar Sara, forcing Raynor to arrange an evacuation to his battlecruiser, the Hyperion. The Raiders embark {{on a series of}} missions to undermine Mengsk, stop frequent Zerg infestations on Terran worlds, gather psychic individuals for military assets, and find the remaining pieces of the Xel'Naga <b>artifact,</b> which they sell to the enigmatic Moebius Foundation in order to fund their revolution. Soon after, Zeratul delivers a psychic crystal that allows Raynor to share visions involving an ominous prophecy where Zerg-Protoss hybrids and an enslaved Zerg swarm wipe out the Terrans and the Protoss. The vision reveals that only Kerrigan has the power to prevent the eradication of all life in the sector and beyond. After collecting more <b>artifact</b> pieces, the Raiders forge an alliance with Valerian Mengsk, Arcturus' son, who is their secret benefactor from Moebius Foundation. After recovering the final <b>artifact</b> piece, Valerian and Raynor work together to invade the Zerg world of Char and use the <b>artifact</b> to restore Kerrigan's humanity, thus weakening the Zerg at the cost of much of the Dominion fleet. An agent of Arcturus makes an attempt on Kerrigan's life, and Raynor defends her and takes her in for medical examination.|$|E
5|$|Raynor is {{the protagonist}} and player {{character}} of StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty. Over {{the course of}} the campaign Raynor's Raiders (as his army is known) fight the Zerg and Mengsk's empire simultaneously. At the behest of a group known as the Moebius Foundation, the Raiders gather the pieces of a Xel'Naga <b>artifact,</b> until it is revealed that the foundation is actually led by Valerian Mengsk, Arcturus's son. Valerian intends to use the artifact's power to destroy the Queen of Blades, proving to the empire's citizens that he will be a worthy successor to the throne. Raynor begrudgingly finishes assembling the <b>artifact</b> and joins the imperial army in an assault on the Zerg homeworld of Char, but not before uncovering proof of Mengsk's treachery on Tarsonis and broadcasting it across the sector. The Terran forces on Char use the <b>artifact</b> to partially restore Kerrigan's humanity, significantly weakening her, but Raynor refuses to kill her.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{contacts}} Mulder, {{who is now}} resting at home. He {{believes that}} the <b>artifact</b> proves that humanity was created by aliens. Diana Fowley, who is with Mulder, contacts the Cigarette Smoking Man. A healing ceremony is held for Albert, but Scully is forced to leave when Skinner contacts her, telling her Mulder is in the hospital. Mulder {{is being held in}} a padded cell and is displaying abnormal brain activity. Scully, after learning that Skinner knows about their earlier conversation with Burks, calls him and Fowley liars and leaves. Scully is about to find a surveillance camera in the X-Files office when she is called by Sandoz telling her that the <b>artifact</b> contains information on human genetics. Sandoz is killed by Krycek shortly afterwards. Scully then heads to the West African Coast where she discovers that the <b>artifact</b> is part of a large spacecraft partially buried in the beach.|$|E

5|$|Several months later, a {{metallic}} <b>artifact</b> with inscriptions is discovered {{on the beach}} of CÃ´te d'Ivoire in Africa. After Mulder examines rubbings of the object, he begins suffering from a headache, seemingly caused by the rubbings. Mulder's condition worsens, but he gains telepathic abilities. Chuck Burks (Bill Dow) tells them that the symbols on the <b>artifact</b> are Navajo. Eventually, Mulder passes into an aggravated delusional state and is placed under observation at a hospital. Hoping to find an answer, Scully rushes to Africa and finds the massive wreck of a large spacecraft partially buried in the beach.|$|E
5|$|Although the Xel'Naga rarely appear {{during the}} novels and the video games, various relics left behind from their legacy are {{scattered}} throughout the series. One such relic appears in Brood War, a large temple on the planet Shakuras containing the power to wipe the planet clear of other species. During the course of Brood War, the Protoss activate the temple {{and use it to}} destroy all of the Zerg on Shakuras. In addition, other structures have been shown in the series. In the novel Shadow of the Xel'Naga, the three main species fight for control of a large Xel'Naga <b>artifact</b> on the planet Bhekar Ro, but accidentally activate it. The <b>artifact</b> releases a creature incubating in the structure, which proceeds to convert the nearby Xel'Naga-empowered Protoss and Zerg forces into energy for nourishment, before disappearing into space. After this, the novel Firstborn reveals that numerous other similar artifacts are discovered by the Terran Dominion within its borders. The Dominion heir Valerian Mengsk consequently sends an archaeological team under Emil Narud to investigate these relics. Wings of Liberty also features a Xel'Naga relic that was broken into pieces. James Raynor and Valerian Mengsk reunite the pieces and, during a bloody invasion of the volcanic Zerg planet of Char, use the relic to restore Sarah Kerrigan back into her human form; the <b>artifact</b> also plays a significant role in Legacy of the Void.|$|E

5|$|In Legacy of the Void, Zeratul invades a Terran {{installation}} {{under control}} of Amon {{in order to}} pinpoint {{the exact location of}} his resurrection, taking advantage of a sudden attack by Kerrigan and the Zerg swarm. After obtaining the exact location, he departs to an ancient Xel'Naga temple where he has a vision of Tassadar, who prompts him to claim the <b>artifact</b> in possession of the Terrans. Zeratul then returns to warn Artanis of Amon's return, but he decides to proceed with his plans of leading his army to reclaim Aiur. However, Amon awakens on Aiur and takes control {{of the majority of the}} Protoss race through the Khala, the telepathic bond that unites all emotions for the Khalai faction of the Protoss. Only Zeratul and the Nerazim, the Dark Templar, are immune due to their lack of connection to the Khala, and the Nerazim proceed to save as many Khalai as they can by severing their nerve chords, which connect them to the Khala, with Zeratul sacrificing himself to save Artanis in the occasion. After escaping the planet with an ancient vessel, the Spear of Adun, Artanis reclaims the <b>artifact</b> as Zeratul suggested and gathers allies among the many Protoss tribes scattered across the galaxy in order to remake his army and launch another assault on Aiur. Using the <b>artifact,</b> Artanis' forces restrain Amon's essence, time enough for the other Khalai Protoss who were still under his control to sever their nerve chords and banish Amon to the Void.|$|E

30|$|Therefore, we {{speculate}} that the poor image quality was mainly caused by the latter two reasons, namely motion <b>artifacts</b> and off-resonance <b>artifacts.</b> In contrast to the intracranial area, {{the head and neck}} area is much more prone to motion and off-resonance <b>artifacts.</b> Pulsation of carotid arteries, breathing, and swallowing are unavoidable sources of significant motion <b>artifacts</b> (Boussel et al. 2006). The interfaces of tissues with different magnetic susceptibility, such as those between air, bone, and tissue, are responsible for off-resonance <b>artifacts</b> (Boussel et al. 2006).
