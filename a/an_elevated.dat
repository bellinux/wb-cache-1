5|$|At {{the time}} of the line's planning, Downtown Flushing was a quiet Dutch-colonial-style village; what is now Roosevelt Avenue in the area was known as Amity Street, a major {{commercial}} thoroughfare in the neighborhood. In late 1912, Flushing community groups were petitioning the Public Service Commission (PSC) to depress the proposed line in Flushing into a subway tunnel, rather than <b>an</b> <b>elevated</b> line. Unlike a subway, an el would cause disturbances to the quality of life and a loss in nearby property values, as well as a widening of Amity Street that would cause more changes to the already existing town. One Amity Street property owner compared the planned effect of <b>an</b> <b>elevated</b> Flushing Line on Amity Street to the degradation of Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn after the Myrtle Avenue Elevated was built there. On the other hand, a subway would only require that the street be widened, even though it was more expensive than <b>an</b> <b>elevated</b> of the same length.|$|E

5|$|D-dimers are a fibrin {{degradation}} product, and <b>an</b> <b>elevated</b> level {{can result}} from plasmin dissolving a clot—or other conditions. Hospitalized patients often have elevated levels for multiple reasons. When individuals are at a high-probability of having DVT, diagnostic imaging is preferred to a D-dimer test. For those with a low or moderate probability of DVT, a D-dimer level might be obtained, which excludes a diagnosis if results are normal. <b>An</b> <b>elevated</b> level requires further investigation with diagnostic imaging to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1910s, a {{completely}} reconstructed New West End Terminal (which gradually became {{better known as}} Coney Island Terminal) was built on <b>an</b> <b>elevated</b> structure.

This new terminal could accommodate hundreds of thousands of passengers a day.

In a 2007 study, Daniela Schwarz and colleagues suggested that the back dipped towards the rear. According to these researchers, the shoulder blade would have been inclined at a horizontal angle of 55–65°, much steeper than previously thought, resulting in <b>an</b> <b>elevated</b> shoulder region. With the vertebral column of the trunk and neck held in a relatively straight line, this would result in <b>an</b> <b>elevated</b> position of the head.|$|E

5|$|<b>An</b> <b>elevated</b> core temperature, {{leading to}} {{increased}} symptom presentation {{has been noted}} during exercise, due to variations in circadian body temperature throughout the day, and due to heat exposure including warm temperatures, warm showers, sun bathing, etc. Care should be taken not to overheat a person with MS {{during the course of}} exercise. There is some evidence that cooling measures are effective in allowing a greater degree of exercise: cold showers, cold water limb immersion, applying ice packs, and drinking cold beverages. These strategies are effective when attempting to decrease core temperature post-exercise, and as a method of pre-cooling prior to physical activity or heat exposure. The interaction between <b>an</b> <b>elevated</b> core temperature and the pathological demyelination can cause a transient nerve conduction block that leads to temporarily impaired physical and cognitive function. These effects translate to reduced patient safety and performance of ADLs, however there are viable prevention strategies. Behavioral strategies to minimize heat exposure include performing outdoor physical activity when temperatures are cooler, or installing an air conditioner.|$|E
