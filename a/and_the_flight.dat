5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{ended up}} being used primarily to develop arresting gear and barriers, but were used operationally {{for a short time}} by at least one Texas-based United States Naval Reserve squadron as they transitioned to jets. Between them, the 30 production aircraft had only a total of 945 hours of flight time, only 31.5 hours each. Some aircraft flew only six hours which was enough for little more than their acceptance flight <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> to their ultimate disposition.|$|E
5|$|The {{title of}} King of Ireland was re-created in 1542 by Henry VIII, then King of England, of the Tudor dynasty. English {{rule of law}} was {{reinforced}} and expanded in Ireland during {{the latter part of}} the 16th century, leading to the Tudor conquest of Ireland. A near complete conquest was achieved by the turn of the 17th century, following the Nine Years' War <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flight</b> of the Earls.|$|E
50|$|Modern darts {{have four}} parts: The points, the barrels, <b>the</b> shafts <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flights.</b> <b>The</b> steel points come in 2 common lengths, 32mm and 41mm and are {{sometimes}} knurled or coated to improve grip. Others {{are designed to}} retract slightly on impact to lessen the chance of bouncing out.|$|R
50|$|The {{air traffic}} is national, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flights</b> are {{normally}} from/to Tenerife North and Gran Canaria. In 2011, the airport carried 170,225 passengers, with 4,674 operations and 135 tons of merchandise.|$|R
50|$|Another four {{unmanned}} VA spacecraft were mated {{together with}} an FGB and launched as TKS spacecraft: <b>the</b> solo <b>flight</b> of Kosmos 929, <b>the</b> Kosmos 1267 <b>flight</b> to Salyut 6 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flights</b> of Kosmos 1443 and Kosmos 1686 to Salyut 7 - the VA spacecraft on <b>the</b> TKS <b>flight</b> of Kosmos 1686 was modified as a no-reentry laboratory segment.|$|R
5|$|Clashes in {{the capital}} between Habré's FAN and pro-Libyan groups became {{progressively}} more serious. On 22 March 1980, a minor incident, as in 1979, triggered the second battle of N'Djamena. In ten days, the clashes between the FAN and Goukouni's FAP, which both had 1,000–1,500 troops in the city, caused thousands of casualties <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> of about half the capital's population. The few remaining French troops, who left on 4 May, proclaimed themselves neutral, as did the Zairean peace force.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, the warbler eats insects {{as well as}} berries, and {{the fruits}} of the {{introduced}} Spanish flag is a favourite where present. An increase in body mass occurs again before the northward migration, birds fattening even more rapidly than prior to their southward journey. Most internal organs (including the liver, spleen, intestines, kidneys and heart) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> muscles lose weight during the journey over the Sahara, although the testes quadruple in mass in preparation for the breeding season. Unlike drier-habitat species like the common whitethroat, they leave from savanna rather than the treeless Sahel further north.|$|E
5|$|Locations in England {{included}} the River Thames, {{for the flight}} of the Order of the Phoenix to Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> of Dumbledore's Army to the Ministry of Magic. This sequence also includes such landmarks as the London Eye, Canary Wharf, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, and the HMS Belfast. Filming at Platform 9¾ took place at King's Cross Station, {{as it has in}} the past. A telephone booth near Scotland Yard was used as Harry and Arthur Weasley enter the Ministry, while the crew closed the Westminster tube station on 22 October 2006 to allow for filming of Arthur Weasley accompanying Harry to his trial at the Ministry of Magic. Other scenes were filmed in and around Oxford, specifically at nearby Blenheim Palace in Woodstock.|$|E

5|$|Munitions and {{ammunition}} handling is accomplished using a Babcock designed highly mechanised weapons handling system (HMWHS). This {{is a first}} naval application of a common land-based warehouse system. The HMWHS moves palletised munitions from the magazines and weapon preparation areas, along track ways and via several lifts, forward and aft or port and starboard. The tracks can carry a pallet to magazines, the hangar, weapons preparation areas, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> deck. In a change from normal procedures the magazines are unmanned, the movement of pallets is controlled from a central location, and manpower is only required when munitions are being initially stored or prepared for use. This system speeds up delivery and reduces {{the size of the}} crew by automation.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen {{years before}} Oceanic 815 crashes on the island, Rousseau was a heavily {{pregnant}} {{member of a}} six-person crew aboard a French research vessel three days out of Tahiti. The crew picked up a radio signal emanating from the South Pacific, which was a repeating set of six numbers: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42. While attempting to find {{the source of the}} signal, the ship ran aground on rocks surrounding the island. Before reaching the shore, Rousseau and her team found Oceanic 815 survivor Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) in the water, who had been time-travelling {{as a result of the}} time shifts which had been moving him <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> survivors through the island's history.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} has no true song, but its vocalisations include an excited series of tschip calls given by {{unpaired}} or courting males. Other monosyllabic chirps {{are used in}} social contacts, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> call is a harsh teck. A study comparing the vocalisations of the introduced Missouri population with those of birds from Germany showed that the US birds had fewer shared syllable types (memes) and more structure within the population than the European sparrows. This may have resulted from {{the small size of}} the founding North American population and a consequent loss of genetic diversity.|$|E

5|$|The Halifaxes and Horsas {{were moved}} to RAF Portreath in Cornwall, to shorten the {{distance}} {{they would have to}} travel. Even so, they were left with a ten-hour flight to Sale airport in Morocco. On arrival at Sale the gliders were released to land on a sand-patch alongside the runway. Once on the ground each Horsa was fitted with the spare landing gear it carried inside, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> immediately took off again on the next leg of the journey, to Mascara in Algeria. Their journey did not end here; they left for the final destination, Kairouan Airfield in Tunisia, as soon as possible. During the flight the gliders were provided with three pilots, who had to change around every hour to relieve fatigue.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} was a Boeing 707 which had accumulated 26,319 airframe hours since its first flight in 1959. It was piloted by Captain Volney D. Matheny, 45, who had 18,753 hours of pilot time. The copilot was First Officer Ronald G. Reichardt, 26, with 1,629 total piloting hours, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> engineer was Robert D. Barron, 39, who had accumulated 11,182 hours as a flight engineer. The stewardesses were Janan Perkins, 21, Roswitha Neal, 25, Kathleen Fankhouser, 21, and Sara Muir, 25.|$|E
5|$|The captain {{asked for}} the descent {{checklist}} at 20:24:24. The fasten seat belt sign was switched on <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> attendant started the process of preparing the cabin for landing. At 20:24:46 the captain, {{as part of the}} checklist, informed the first officer that they would go down to 1,500 ft at Torghatten and then down to 550ft. This was followed first by a partially unreadable conversation between the captain and the first officers, which included if they were to fill fuel, and then an unreadable conversation between the captain and the jump seat passenger. The direction of the VHF omnidirectional radio range (VOR) and distance measuring equipment (DME) at Brønnøysund was checked at 20:26:37.|$|E

5|$|As the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) {{increasingly}} supported SAO Krajina and the Croatian Police {{was unable}} {{to cope with the}} situation, the Croatian National Guard (ZNG) was formed in May 1991. The development of the military of Croatia was hampered by a UN arms embargo introduced in September, while the military conflict in Croatia continued to escalatethe Battle of Vukovar started on 26 August. By the end of August the fighting intensified in Lika as well, including in Gospic where fighting to control the city continued through much of September. Although Gospić was controlled by Croat forces, it remained under Serbian artillery bombardment after the battle. The fighting resulted in heavy damage to the town <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> of the bulk of its population after which only about 3,000 residents remainined. Before the war, Gospić had a population of 8,000, including 3,000 Serbs. Many Serbs previously living in the town fled but Croatian authorities urged them to return through television and radio broadcasts.|$|E
5|$|By October 1915 Campania had {{exercised}} {{with the}} Grand Fleet seven times, but had only flown off aircraft {{three times as}} the North Sea was often too rough for her seaplanes to use. Her captain recommended that the flying-off deck be lengthened and given a steeper slope to allow gravity to boost the aircraft's acceleration and the ship was accordingly modified at Cammell Laird between November 1915 and early April 1916. The forward funnel was split into two funnels <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> deck was extended between them and over the bridge to a length of , so that aircraft from both holds could use the flight deck. A canvas windscreen was provided to allow the aircraft to unfold their wings out of the wind, and a kite balloon {{and all of its}} supporting equipment were added in the aft hold. Campania now carried seven Short Type 184 torpedo bombers and three or four smaller fighters or scouts; a Type 184 made its first takeoff from the flight deck on 3 June 1916, also using a wheeled trolley. This success prompted the Admiralty to order the world's first aircraft designed for carrier operations, the Fairey Campania. The ship received the first of these aircraft in late 1917 where they joined smaller Sopwith 1½ Strutter scouts. At various times Campania also carried the Sopwith Baby and Sopwith Pup.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} it was re-formed as No.1 AFTS, the flying school at Point Cook had also been made {{responsible}} for training the RAAF's air traffic controllers; this role was transferred to Central Flying School at East Sale in December 1956. Southern Area Command was re-formed as Training Command in September 1953. On 28May 1958, No.1 AFTS relocated to RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, where its Wirraways were replaced by deHavilland Vampire jet trainers, which required a runway longer than that at Point Cook. The school's place at Point Cook was taken by No.1 BFTS, which transferred from Uranquinty on 19December. By this time the RAAF had decided to commission all pilots and navigators, who would be selected for these roles upon induction into the service; navigators therefore went straight to the School of Air Navigation at East Sale, without attending flying training school. On 31December 1958, the Flying Training Squadron of RAAF College was disbanded, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> instruction component of the four-year cadet course became the responsibility of No.1 BFTS (for basic training) and No.1 AFTS (for advanced training). Previously, the cadets had used FTS aircraft under RAAF College instructors, but from 1959 their flight training was fully integrated with the FTS system.|$|E

5|$|Consequently, and at {{the urging}} of Shufeldt, Heilmann devoted much of the next few years {{attempting}} to find an English–language publisher willing to undertake a translation of his work. None of the larger publishers he approached were willing to do so unless Heilmann himself was prepared to finance it, which he was unable to do. In the meantime, Heilmann took the opportunity to revise and improve his manuscript, which included information he acquired from examining the Berlin specimen of Archaeopteryx {{for the first time in}} 1923 at the invitation of Josef Felix Pompeckj, a professor at the Natural History Museum in Berlin. Examining this important specimen in person allowed Heilmann to add some additional details and revisions to his understanding of the hip, the skull, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> feathers. With the help of the English paleontologist Arthur Smith Woodward of the British Museum, he finally met success in finding a small London publisher willing to produce an English version of his manuscript in 1926.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia {{established}} the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) {{to investigate the}} incident, working with foreign aviation authorities and experts. Malaysia has stated that a final report on Flight 370 will be released {{by the end of}} 2017. Neither the crew nor the aircraft's communication systems relayed a distress signal, indications of bad weather, or technical problems before the aircraft vanished. Two passengers travelling on stolen passports were investigated, but eliminated as suspects. Malaysian police have identified the captain as the prime suspect if human intervention was the cause of the disappearance, after clearing all others on the flight of suspicious motives. Power was lost to the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) at some point between 01:07 and 02:03; the SDU logged onto Inmarsat's satellite communication network at 02:25—three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar. Based on analysis of the satellite communications, the aircraft turned south after passing north of Sumatra <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> continued for six hours with little deviation in its track, ending when its fuel was exhausted.|$|E
5|$|No.457 Squadron {{was formed}} at RAF Baginton in England on 16June 1941. It was {{equipped}} with Supermarine Spitfires and was the second RAAF fighter unit to be formed in England after No.452 Squadron. The establishment of both these squadrons formed part of an expansion of RAF Fighter Command which sought to improve its ability to defend Britain from a renewed German air offensive and to conduct offensive operations over occupied Europe. At {{the time of its}} formation the squadron's commanding officer, Squadron Leader Peter Malam Brothers, both flight commanders and all members of the ground crew were British, but most pilots were Australian. The squadron's ground crew component had been formed at RAAF Station Williamtown in Australia on 10June, and departed for England on 7August. On the same day No.457 Squadron moved to RAF Jurby and thence to RAF Andreas, which were both situated on the Isle of Man to undertake training. While at the Isle of Man the squadron trained both its own pilots and pilots from other squadrons for operational duties, and for a time functioned as an operational training unit at RAF Andreas. It also escorted Allied convoys in the Irish Sea, but did not make contact with German aircraft. By October all the British pilots other than Brothers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> commanders had been replaced by Australians. The squadron's ground crew arrived in Britain during October and November, making it an almost entirely Australian unit.|$|E
