Not only occurrence frequency of a pattern but also occurrence behaviour of a pattern may be treated as important criteria to measure the interestingness of a pattern. A frequent pattern {{is said to be}} regular frequent if the occurrence behaviour is {{less than or equal to}} the user given regularity threshold. In incremental transactional databases the occurrence frequency and the occurrence behaviour of a pattern changes whenever a small set of new transactions are added to the database. It is undesirable to mine regular frequent patterns from the scratch. Thus proposes a new algorithm called RFPID (Regular Frequent Pattern Mining in Incremental Databases) to mine regular frequent patterns in incremental transactional databases using vertical data format which requires only one database scan. The experimental results show our algorithm is efficient in both memory utilization and execution...|$|R

Hence, how to address large-scale energy retrofit of existing building stocks? The paper handles this issue by employing a methodology that provides a robust energy analysis of building categories. This is denoted as SLABE, “Simulation-based Large-scale uncertainty/sensitivity Analysis of Building Energy performance”. It was presented by the same authors and is here enhanced to investigate a whole and heterogeneous building stock that includes various categories. Each category is represented via a Representative Building Sample (RBS), which is defined through Latin hypercube sampling and uncertainty analysis. Hence, optimal retrofit packages are found in function of building location, intended use and construction type. Two families of optimal solutions are achieved. The first one collects the most energy-efficient (and thus sustainable) solutions, among the ones that produce global cost savings, thereby addressing the public perspective. The second one collects cost-optimal solutions thereby addressing the private perspective. EnergyPlus is employed as a simulation tool and coupled with MATLAB® for data analysis and processing.

We investigated the effect of the implementation of a commercial, integrated, prescribing, <b>administration</b> and <b>stock</b> control system with clinical decision support in a controlled, prospective manner on a general medical ward. Its impact on the quality of medicine administration was evaluated over three months. We were also interested in the effect on the clinical efficiency of the ward and the need for education and training in the use of an electronic integrated prescribing and medicines-administration system. The results demonstrated that the proportion of medicines administered successfully rose from 90 % on the existing paper-based system to 95 % on the electronic system (p< 0. 001). The clinical pharmacist identified errors in 12 % of paper prescriptions with 1 % of administrations being deferred as a consequence of unclear prescribing or lack of administration details. All electronic prescribing ultimately passed clinical checks (94 % after one or fewer modifications) and was always clear at the point of administration. The time taken for prescribing and medicines administration increased significantly, administration time doubling. A marginal improvement in wasted or returned medicines occurred.

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{a number of}} key issues regarding applications of e-business and Information & Communication Technologies in European Food and Beverage Industry. For this purpose a pan European survey was conducted during the period October-November 2002. The role and use of ICT technologies mirrors the structure of the industry: dominance by large multinationals, where the creation of industrial groups (tied to mergers and subsidiaries) has encouraged the installation of interconnected local networks. The main factors that push companies in the food sector to consider ICT solutions include greater efficiency in internal processes (productive, administrative, delivery of orders, etc) as well as integration of internal processes with external organisations to improve logistics and reduce costs. E-business solutions (ICTs & software) focus predominately on the business interface and on integrating activities such as accounting, <b>administration,</b> and <b>stock</b> control. Large software houses have developed flexible ERP systems for many food manufacturers. It is mostly the larger agribusinesses that deploy this software, though there are examples of bespoke applications created by small in-house IT teams (often in medium-sized enterprises). Core sector business areas are: supply, production, logistics, services, and marketing & sales. Other critical areas now being targeted for improvement are: packaging processes, the control of quality in Hazard Analysis and Control Critical Points (HACCP), the quality of the product, and the reverse supply chain management of returned products. Recently there has been a growing trend for larger companies to concentrate on improving logistics, by upgrading inventory management and storage capacity and trying to improve the flows of input and output in order to avoid stock breaches and guarantee more punctual deliveries. Sophisticated electronic infrastructures have been installed to improve distribution. However, whilst there is a demand for increased ICT integration, the current diffusion of applications is believed to be low outside of large multinationals and their larger suppliers. For the most part, suppliers have more traditional relationships and communication techniques, and the operational focus is on quantity, quality, and delivery schedules. The study concludes with recommendations for further research...|$|R

2500|$|At {{independence}} {{and after the}} independence of India, India has maintained such central British institutions as parliamentary government, one-person, one-vote {{and the rule of}} law through nonpartisan courts. It retained as well the institutional arrangements of the Raj such as district <b>administration,</b> universities and <b>stock</b> exchanges. One major change was the rejection of separate princely states. Metcalf shows that over the course of two centuries, British intellectuals and Indian specialists made the highest priority bringing peace, unity and good government to India. They offered many competing methods to reach the goal. [...] For example, Cornwallis recommended turning Bengali Zamindar into the sort of English landlords that controlled local affairs in England. Munro proposed to deal directly with the peasants. Sir William Jones and the Orientalists promoted Sanskrit, while Macaulay promoted the English language. [...] Zinkin argues that in the long-run, what matters most about the legacy of the Raj is the British political ideologies which the Indians took over after 1947, especially the belief in unity, democracy, the rule of law and a certain equality beyond caste and creed. Zinkin sees this not just in the Congress party but also among Hindu Nationalists in the Bharatiya Janata Party, which specifically emphasises Hindu traditions.|$|R
40|$|This review article, {{with a clear}} {{political}} science and public <b>administration</b> bias, takes <b>stock</b> of the existing literature on EU agencies and suggests a future research agenda. The article reviews studies on EU agencies' organization, tasks, proliferation and location in the political-administrative space. Whether the advent of EU agencies tends to underpin a basically intergovernmental, transnational or supranational order has potentially huge consequences for the distribution of power across levels of government, for the degree of policy uniformity and pooling of administrative resources across countries, {{for the role of}} genuinely European perspectives in the policy process, and for accountability relations. Although the jury is still partly out on most topics, we see the contours of a more direct multilevel administration in which EU agencies not only constitute nodes within transnational agency networks, but in addition, in governance terms, relate more closely to the European Commission than to any other institution.

5000|$|At {{independence}} {{and after the}} independence of India, India has maintained such central British institutions as parliamentary government, one-person, one-vote {{and the rule of}} law through nonpartisan courts. It retained as well the institutional arrangements of the Raj such as district <b>administration,</b> universities and <b>stock</b> exchanges. One major change was the rejection of separate princely states. Metcalf shows that over the course of two centuries, British intellectuals and Indian specialists made the highest priority bringing peace, unity and good government to India. They offered many competing methods to reach the goal. For example, Cornwallis recommended turning Bengali Zamindar into the sort of English landlords that controlled local affairs in England. Munro proposed to deal directly with the peasants. Sir William Jones and the Orientalists promoted Sanskrit, while Macaulay promoted the English language. [...] Zinkin argues that in the long-run, what matters most about the legacy of the Raj is the British political ideologies which the Indians took over after 1947, especially the belief in unity, democracy, the rule of law and a certain equality beyond caste and creed. Zinkin sees this not just in the Congress party but also among Hindu Nationalists in the Bharatiya Janata Party, which specifically emphasises Hindu traditions.|$|R
