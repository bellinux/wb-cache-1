40|$|Developmental dyslexia, {{a severe}} and {{persistent}} reading and spelling impairment, {{is characterized by}} difficulties in processing speech sounds (i. e., phonemes). Here, we test the hypothesis that these phonological difficulties {{are associated with a}} dysfunction of the <b>auditory</b> sensory <b>thalamus,</b> the medial geniculate body (MGB).

No other structure in the auditory pathway showed distinct functional neural patterns between the two tasks for dyslexic and control participants. Furthermore, MGB activity correlated with dyslexia diagnostic scores, indicating that the task modulation of the MGB is critical for performance in dyslexics. These results suggest that deficits in dyslexia are associated with a failure of the neural mechanism that dynamically tunes MGB according to predictions from cortical areas to optimize speech processing.

40|$|We report {{evidence}} for a context- and not stimulus-dependent functional asymmetry in {{the left and right}} human <b>auditory</b> midbrain, <b>thalamus,</b> and cortex in response to monaural sounds. Neural activity elicited by left- and right-ear stimulation was measured simultaneously in the cochlear nuclei, inferior colliculi (ICs), medial geniculate bodies (MGBs), and auditory cortices (ACs) in 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments. In experiment 1, pulsed noise was presented monaurally to either ear, or binaurally, simulating a moving sound source. In experiment 2, only monaural sounds were presented. The results show a modulation of the neural responses to monaural sounds by the presence of binaural sounds at a time scale of tens of seconds: In the absence of binaural stimulation, the left and right ICs, MGBs, and ACs responded stronger to stimulation of the contralateral ear. When blocks of binaural stimuli were interspersed in the sound sequence, the contralateral preference vanished in those structures in the right hemisphere. The resulting hemispheric asymmetry was similar to the asymmetry demonstrated for spatial sound processing. Taken together, the data demonstrate that functional asymmetries in auditory processing are modulated by context. The observed long time constant suggests that this effect results from a "top-down" mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Eyeblink conditioning, {{a type of}} associativemotor learning, {{requires}} the cerebellum. Themedial <b>auditory</b> <b>thalamus</b> is a necessary source of stimulus input to the cerebellum during auditory eyeblink conditioning. Nothing is currently known about interactions between the thalamus and cerebellum during associative learning. In the current study, neuronal activity was recorded in the cerebellar interpositus nucleus and medial <b>auditory</b> <b>thalamus</b> simultaneously from multiple tetrodes during auditory eyeblink conditioning to examine the relative timing of learning-related plasticity within these interconnected areas. Learning-related changes in neuronal activity correlated with the eyeblink conditioned response were evident in the cerebellum before the medial <b>auditory</b> <b>thalamus</b> {{over the course of}} training and within conditioning trials, suggesting that thalamic plasticity may be driven by cerebellar feedback.

40|$|Phantom sensations and sensory {{hypersensitivity}} are disordered {{perceptions that}} characterize {{a variety of}} intractable conditions involving the somatosensory, visual, and auditory modalities. We report physiological correlates of two perceptual abnormalities in the auditory domain: tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound, and hyperacusis, a decreased tolerance of sound based on loudness. Here, subjects with and without tinnitus, all with clinically normal hearing thresholds, underwent 1) behavioral testing to assess sound-level tolerance and 2) functional MRI to measure sound-evoked activation of central auditory centers. Despite receiving identical sound stimulation levels, subjects with diminished sound-level tolerance (i. e., hyperacusis) showed elevated activation in the <b>auditory</b> midbrain, <b>thalamus,</b> and primary <b>auditory</b> cortex compared with subjects with normal tolerance. Primary auditory cortex, but not subcortical centers, showed elevated activation specifically related to tinnitus. The results directly link hyperacusis and tinnitus to hyperactivity within the central auditory system.

40|$|To {{follow an}} ever-changing {{auditory}} scene, the auditory brain is continuously creating {{a representation of}} the past to form expectations about the future. Unexpected events will produce an error in the predictions that should trigger the network’s response. Indeed, neurons in the <b>auditory</b> midbrain, <b>thalamus</b> and cortex, respond to rarely occurring sounds while adapting to frequently repeated ones, i. e., they exhibit stimulus specific adaptation (SSA). SSA cannot be explained solely by intrinsic membrane properties, but likely involves the participation of the network. Thus, SSA is envisaged as a high order form of adaptation that requires the influence of cortical areas. However, present research supports the hypothesis that SSA, at least in its simplest form (i. e., to frequency deviants), can be transmitted in a bottom-up manner through the auditory pathway. Here, we briefly review the underlying neuroanatomy of the corticofugal projections before discussing state of the art studies which demonstrate that SSA present in the medial geniculate body and inferior colliculus is not inherited from the cortex but can be modulated by the cortex via the corticofugal pathways. By modulating the gain of neurons in the thalamus and midbrain, the auditory cortex would refine SSA subcortically, preventing irrelevant information from reaching the cortex...|$|R

It was shown that EEG changes did not occur when the standard electromagnetic headphones were replaced by air conduction headphones, which were connected to a remote transducer by rubber tubes.

The functional organization of the primary and nonprimary subdivisions of the <b>auditory</b> <b>thalamus</b> is not well characterized, particularly in awake primates. We have recorded from neurons in the <b>auditory</b> <b>thalamus</b> of awake marmoset monkeys and tested their responses to tones, band-pass noise, and temporally modulated stimuli.

Three medial geniculate body (MGB) subdivisions were identified and studied physiologically and anatomically, although other medial subdivisions were also identified anatomically. Neurons in the ventral subdivision (MGV) were sharply tuned for frequency, preferred narrowband stimuli, and were able to synchronize to rapid temporal modulations. Anterodorsal subdivision (MGAD) neurons appeared well suited for temporal processing, responding similarly to tone or noise stimuli but able to synchronize to the highest modulation frequencies and with the highest temporal precision among MGB subdivisions. Posterodorsal subdivision (MGPD) neurons differed substantially from the other two subdivisions, with many neurons preferring broadband stimuli and signaling changes in modulation frequency with nonsynchronized changes in firing rate. Most neurons in all subdivisions responded to increases in tone sound level with nonmonotonic changes in firing rate.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{examined the}} neural mechanisms underlying the ontogenetic emergence of auditory eyeblink conditioning. Previous {{studies found that}} the medial <b>auditory</b> <b>thalamus</b> is necessary for eyeblink conditioning with an auditory conditioned stimulus (CS) in adult rats. In experiment 1, stimulation of the medial <b>auditory</b> <b>thalamus</b> {{was used as a}} CS in rat pups trained on postnatal days (P) 17 – 18, 24 – 25, or 31 – 32. All three age groups showed significant acquisition relative to unpaired controls. However, there was an age-related increase in the rate of conditioning. Experiment 2 examined the effect of inactivating the medial <b>auditory</b> <b>thalamus</b> with muscimol on auditory eyeblink conditioning in rats trained on P 17 – 18, 24 – 25, or 31 – 32. Rat pups trained on P 24 – 25 and P 31 – 32, but not P 17 – 18, showed a significant reduction in conditioned responses following muscimol infusions. The findings suggest that the thalamic contribution to auditory eyeblink conditioning continues to develop through the first postnatal month. Developmental studies of associative learning in rats have dem-onstrated that conditioning emerges ontogenetically at different ages depending on the sensory modality of the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the particular conditioned response (CR) that is measured (Rudy 1992; Hunt and Campbell 1997).

40|$|Tinnitus, {{the ongoing}} {{perception}} of {{sound in the}} absence of a physical stimulus, and hyperacusis, the intolerance of sound intensities considered comfortable by most people, are two often co-occurring clinical conditions lacking effective treatments. This thesis identified neural correlates of these poorly understood disorders using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to measure sound-evoked activity in the auditory pathway. Subjects with clinically normal hearing thresholds, with and without tinnitus, underwent fMRI or ABR testing and behavioral assessment of sound-level tolerance (SLT). The <b>auditory</b> midbrain, <b>thalamus,</b> and primary <b>auditory</b> cortex (PAC) showed elevated fMRI activation related to reduced SLT (i. e. hyperacusis). PAC, but not midbrain or thalamus, showed elevated fMRI activation related to tinnitus, perhaps reflecting undue attention to the auditory domain. In contrast to fMRI activation, ABRs showed relationships only to tinnitus, not SLT. Wave I of the ABR, which reflects auditory nerve activity, was reduced in tinnitus subjects, while wave V, reflecting input activity to the midbrain, was elevated. Wave I reduction in tinnitus subjects suggests that auditory nerve dysfunction apparent only above threshold is a factor in tinnitus. Because ABRs reflect activity in only one of multiple pathways from cochlear nucleus to midbrain, the wave V elevation implicates this particular pathway in tinnitus. The results directly link tinnitus and hyperacusis to hyperactivity within the central auditory system. Because fMRI and ABRs reflect different aspects of neural activity, the dependence of fMRI activation on SLT and ABR activity on tinnitus in the midbrain raises the possibility that tinnitus and hyperacusis arise in parallel from abnormal activity in separate brainstem pathways. by Jianwen Wendy Gu.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at {{identifying}} the neurophysiological responses associated with auditory stimulation during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep using simultaneous EEG/fMRI recordings. It was reported earlier that auditory stimuli produce bilateral activation in <b>auditory</b> cortex, <b>thalamus,</b> and caudate during both wakefulness and NREM-sleep. However, {{due to the}} spontaneous membrane potential fluctuations cortical responses may be highly variable during NREM. Here we now examine the modulation of cerebral responses to tones depending on {{the presence or absence}} of sleep spindles and the phase of the slow oscillation. Thirteen healthy young subjects were scanned successfully during stage 2 - 4 NREM sleep in the first half of the night in a 3 T scanner. Subjects were not sleep-deprived and sounds were post-hoc classified according to (i) the presence of sleep spindles or (ii) the phase of the slow oscillation during (&# 177; 300 ms) tone delivery. These detected sounds were then entered as regressors of interest in fMRI analyses. Interestingly wake-like responses persisted during NREM sleep, except during present spindles (Dang-Vu et al., 2011) and the positive going phase of the slow oscillation during which responses became absent. While the phase of the slow oscillation did not alter brain responses in primary sensory cortex, it did modulate responses at higher cortical levels. In addition EEG analyses show a distinct N 550 response to tones during the presence of spindles and suggest that in deep NREM sleep the brain is more responsive during the negative going slope of the slow oscillation. The presence of short temporal windows during which the brain is open to external stimuli is consistent with the fact that even during deep sleep meaningful events can be detected. Altogether, our results emphasize the notion that spontaneous fluctuations of brain activity profoundly modify brain responses to external information across all behavioural states, including deep NREM slee...|$|R

However, the eventual viability of such devices for use in the treatment of neurological dysfunction may be ultimately constrained by the intrinsic brittleness of silicon, the material most commonly used for manufacture of penetrating microelectrodes. This brittleness creates predisposition for catastrophic fracture, which may adversely affect the reliability and safety of such devices, due to potential for fragmentation within the brain. Herein, we report the development of titanium-based penetrating microelectrodes that seek to address this potential future limitation. Titanium provides advantage relative to silicon due to its superior fracture toughness, which affords potential for creation of robust devices that are resistant to catastrophic failure. Realization of these devices is enabled by recently developed techniques which provide opportunity for fabrication of high-aspect-ratio micromechanical structures in bulk titanium substrates.

Applying the same rewiring paradigm to a transgenic mouse lacking the EphA receptor family ligands ephrin-A 2 and ephrin-A 5 results in more extensive rewiring than in the wild-type strain. We also show {{for the first time}} that ephrin-A 2 and ephrin-A 5 define a distinct border between visual and <b>auditory</b> <b>thalamus.</b> In the absence of this ephrin-A 2 /A 5 border and after rewiring surgery, retinal afferents are better able to invade and innervate the deafferented <b>auditory</b> <b>thalamus.</b> These data suggest that signals that induce retinal axons to innervate the denervated <b>auditory</b> <b>thalamus</b> may compete with barriers, such as the ephrins, that serve to contain them within the normal target.

This thesis presents three MRI studies that provide new information regarding structural and functional distinctions between auditory centers in living humans. The first study compared {{the effect of}} a fundamental acoustic variable, sound level, on the population neural activity of <b>auditory</b> brainstem, <b>thalamus</b> and cortex. Brainstem and cortex exhibited contrasting sensitivities to sound level (growth in activation followed by saturation in brainstem vs. plateau then growth in cortex), with thalamus showing intermediate properties. The second study identified functional distinctions between cortical areas by spatially mapping the temporal properties of fMRI responses. Using a continuous noise stimulus, we found sustained responses on Heschl's gyrus flanked medially and laterally by more phasic activity. This pattern suggests that transient activity marking {{the beginning and end of}} a sound is most pronounced in non-primary areas of auditory cortex. The region of sustained responses may correspond to primary and primary-like areas. Thus, it may present a physiological marker for these areas in neuroimaging studies, something that has long been needed in the auditory neuroimaging field. The third study examined whether auditory cortical areas can be distinguished - in the living human brain - based on classical features of cortical gray matter previously resolvable only in postmortem tissue. (cont.) By mapping the imaging parameter R 1, we identified regions of heavily myelinated gray matter that may correspond to primary auditory cortex. We further found greater gray matter myelination of the left temporal lobe, which may be a substrate for higher fidelity temporal processing on the left, and for left-hemispheric speech and language specializations. Being able to resolve gray matter structure in-vivo opens the way to relating cortical physiology and structure directly in living humans in ways previously possible only in animals. by Irina S.

40|$|Nicotine enhances sensory and {{cognitive}} processing via actions at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), yet the precise circuit- and systems-level mechanisms remain unclear. In sensory cortex, nicotinic modulation of receptive fields (RFs) provides {{a model to}} probe mechanisms by which nAChRs regulate cortical circuits. Here, we examine RF modulation in mouse primary auditory cortex (A 1) using a novel electrophysiological approach: current-source density (CSD) analysis of responses to tone-in-notched-noise (TINN) acoustic stimuli. TINN stimuli consist of a tone at the characteristic frequency (CF) of the recording site embedded within a white noise stimulus filtered to create a spectral "notch" of variable width centered on CF. Systemic nicotine (2. 1 mg/kg) enhanced responses to the CF tone and to narrow-notch stimuli, yet reduced the response to wider-notch stimuli, indicating increased response gain within a narrowed RF. Subsequent manipulations showed that modulation of cortical RFs by systemic nicotine reflected effects at several levels in the auditory pathway: nicotine suppressed responses in the <b>auditory</b> midbrain and <b>thalamus,</b> with suppression increasing with spectral distance from CF so that RFs became narrower, and facilitated responses in the thalamocortical pathway, while nicotinic actions within A 1 further contributed to both suppression and facilitation. Thus, multiple effects of systemic nicotine integrate along the ascending auditory pathway. These actions at nAChRs in cortical and subcortical circuits, which mimic effects of auditory attention, likely contribute to nicotinic enhancement of sensory {{and cognitive}} processing...|$|R
