5|$|Corley instituted {{sweeping}} changes in {{leadership in the}} regiment, hoping to improve its combat performance. He was able {{to cut down on}} straggling to a degree with more strict threats of court martial, but this had a negative effect on the regiment's morale. He began a unit newspaper, eventually called Eagle Forward, and moved to allow more discourse for the soldiers <b>and</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>of</b> the unit, and this was shown to improve the morale to a degree. Wanting to build a sense of pride in the unit, he sought to emphasize the toughness of the battles the regiment had seen, and played up its victory at the Battle of Yechon while downplaying other poor performances.|$|E

5|$|Maryland's Senate {{consists}} of Senators elected from 47 Senate districts.

These powers place the President of the Maryland Senate among the strongest state legislature presiding officers in the country.|$|E

5|$|The first {{attempts}} {{to create a}} breed registry in 1903 and 1904 failed. In 1912, another attempt was made, this time successful, and a stud book was created in Dijon in 1913.

However, by 1917, the physical characteristics of the breed were still not fixed, <b>and</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>of</b> the equine community were critical, and doubtful of whether the Auxois was a breed in its own right or still merely a subtype of the Ardennais. They were also unsure whether {{it was a good idea}} to accept the recognition of another regional breed, of which France had many.|$|E

5|$|Lavagna {{proposed}} to slow {{economic growth and}} control inflation. Kirchner rejected this, promoting wage increases to reduce economic inequality and extending unemployment insurance {{and other types of}} social welfare. Public services such as public transportation, electricity, gas and water supply were subsidized and kept at low prices. Food industries were subsidied as well. The subsidies eventually expanded to several uncommon areas. This increased the economic activity, but also increased inflation and reduced the private investment in those areas. Unable to control inflation, the government influenced the National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina, which under-reported it, as well as poverty (which was calculated with the inflation figures). The superpowers law, sanctioned during the crisis, was prorrogated and eventually made permanent in 2006; this law allowed the president to rearrange the budget with supervision from the Congress. Kirchner sought to win over the Argentine Workers' Central Union <b>and</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>of</b> more moderate piquetero factions to reduce the chances of strikes and protests. He nevertheless continued to oppose hard-line elements of the piquetero movement, such as that of Raúl Castells. Kirchner's policy helped to fragment the piqueteros, with some declaring their allegiance to him and others continuing to oppose him. Their usual system of protest (blocking streets) made them highly unpopular. However, Kirchner refused to suppress the piquetero demonstrations to avoid the risk of further violence.|$|E
