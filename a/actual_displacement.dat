40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the intensity of unrest phases at active volcanoes is a crucial topic in volcano hazard studies. This is particularly troublesome {{in the case of}} persistently active volcanoes like Stromboli (Southern Italy), where intense eruptive summit activity (overflows, strong spattering, powerful explosions) has in some cases anticipated a flank eruption. In this context, a new approach for the analysis of displacement data is introduced. Daily displacements of the Stromboli crater terrace measured between January 1, 2010, and August 7, 2014, by a ground-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar system were compared, in retrospect, to displacement predictions provided by an autoregressive integrated moving average-based model. The methodology consisted in assessing when the <b>actual</b> <b>displacements</b> exceeded a fixed probability threshold for the forecasts (* 95 %). Two sets of data were consequently produced: (1) series of residuals between <b>actual</b> <b>displacements</b> and model threshold (‘‘anomalies’’) and (2) series of normalized residuals between <b>actual</b> <b>displacements</b> and model threshold (‘‘normalized anomalies’’). This permitted to statistically identify and quantify the anomalous deformation at the crater terrace over the reference time interval of the analysis. Anomalies started to occur before each period of intense volcanic activity, highlighting the possibility to discern between background activity and unrest. Moreover, results indicated that the inflation of the crater terrace during the preparatory phase of the 2014 flank eruption was characterized by the greatest amount of anomalous deformation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Friction {{forces in}} the joints of {{manipulators}} of a force-feedback teleoperator apply unwanted resistant forces to the human operator who moves the master manipulator. The resistant forces contribute to operator fatigue and reduce the transparency of the teleoperator in low frequencies. This paper presents a model-based approach to cancel friction in manipulators of a teleoperator with a compliant tendon drive. Friction compensation reduces the resistant forces applied to the operator and improves the transparency, but it can cause oscillations. This is due to displacement lags between the inputs to the friction compensators and <b>actual</b> <b>displacements</b> of friction contact surfaces that can cause overcompensation around zero velocity. We use a low-stiffness Dahl model to prevent over-compensation around zero velocity. It is shown using passivity theory that the low-stiffness friction compensators preserve the passivity of the teleoperator. Experiments performed on a teleoperator confirm the theoretical results.

The remaining viewgraphs describe the minimum parameter formulation of the general classical laminate theory plate problem as follows: The general CLT plate problem is expressed as a 3 x 3 system of differential equations in the displacements u, v, and w. The eighteen (six each) A(sub ij), B(sub ij), and D(sub ij) system coefficients are ply-weighted sums of the transformed reduced stiffnesses (bar-Q(sub ij)) (sub k); the (bar-Q(sub ij)) (sub k) in turn depend on six reduced stiffnesses (Q(sub ij)) (sub k) and the material and geometry properties of the k(sup th) layer.
