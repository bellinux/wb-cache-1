Kermesite is the result of partial oxidation between stibnite (Sb2S3) and other <b>antimony</b> <b>oxides</b> such as valentinite (Sb2O3) or stibiconite (Sb3O6(OH)). Under certain conditions with oxygenated fluids the transformation of all sulfur to oxygen would occur but kermesite occurs when that transformation is halted.|$|E

50|$|Fires {{with high}} {{availability}} of oxygen burn {{at a high}} temperature and with small amount of smoke produced; the particles are mostly composed of ash, or with large temperature differences, of condensed aerosol of water. High temperature also leads to production of nitrogen oxides. Sulfur content yields sulfur dioxide, or in case of incomplete combustion, hydrogen sulfide. Carbon and hydrogen are almost completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and water. Fires burning with lack of oxygen produce a significantly wider palette of compounds, many of them toxic. Partial oxidation of carbon produces carbon monoxide, nitrogen-containing materials can yield hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, and nitrogen oxides. Hydrogen gas can be produced instead of water. Content of halogens such as chlorine (e.g. in polyvinyl chloride or brominated flame retardants) may lead to production of e.g. hydrogen chloride, phosgene, dioxin, and chloromethane, bromomethane and other halocarbons. Hydrogen fluoride can be formed from fluorocarbons, whether fluoropolymers subjected to fire or halocarbon fire suppression agents. Phosphorus and <b>antimony</b> <b>oxides</b> and their reaction products can be formed from some fire retardant additives, increasing smoke toxicity and corrosivity. Pyrolysis of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), e.g. from burning older transformer oil, and to lower degree also of other chlorine-containing materials, can produce 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, a potent carcinogen, and other polychlorinated dibenzodioxins. Pyrolysis of fluoropolymers, e.g. teflon, in presence of oxygen yields carbonyl fluoride (which hydrolyzes readily to HF and CO2); other compounds may be formed as well, e.g. carbon tetrafluoride, hexafluoropropylene, and highly toxic perfluoroisobutene (PFIB).|$|E
40|$|The {{products}} on the interface of a molybdenum electrode and glass melt were investigated primarily at 1400 °C in three model glass melts without ingredients, with 1 % Sb 2 O 3 and with 1 % Sb 2 O 3 and 0. 5 % SO 3 (wt. %), both under and without load by alternating current. Corrosion of the molybdenum electrode in glass melt without AC load is higher by one order of magnitude if <b>antimony</b> <b>oxides</b> are present. The corrosion continues to increase if sulfate is present in addition to <b>antimony</b> <b>oxides.</b> Isolated antimony droplets largely occur on the electrode-glass melt interface, and numerous droplets are also dissipated in the surrounding glass if only <b>antimony</b> <b>oxides</b> {{are present in the}} glass melt. A comparatively continuous layer of antimony occurs on the interface if SO 3 is also present, antimony being always in contact with molybdenum sulfide. Almost no antimony droplets are dissipated in the glass melt. The total amount of precipitated antimony also increases. The presence of sulfide on the interface likely facilitates antimony precipitation. The reaction of molybdenum with <b>antimony</b> <b>oxides</b> is inhibited in sites covered by an antimony layer. The composition of sulfide layers formed at 1400 °C approximates that of Mo 2 S 3. At 1100 °C, the sulfide composition approximates that of MoS 4. Corrosion multiplies in the glass melt without additions through the effect of AC current, most molybdenum being separated in the form of metallic particles. Corrosion also increases in the glass melt containing <b>antimony</b> <b>oxides.</b> This is due to increased corrosion in the neighborhood of the separated antimony droplets. This mechanism also results in the loosening of molybdenum particles. The amount of precipitated antimony also increases through the effect of the AC current. AC exerts no appreciable effect on either corrosion, the character of the electrode-glass interface, or antimony precipitation in the glass melt containing SO 3...|$|E

40|$|Boro-phosphate glasses {{containing}} {{transition metal}} oxides are of special interest. Hence, some sodium-Boro-phosphate glasses containing iron and <b>antimony</b> <b>oxides</b> were prepared and investigated. The structural investigation indicated {{the presence of}} dierent borate {{groups as well as}} tetragonal phosphate units. Most of the iron cations were found to occupy the low spin Fe 3 + in the tetrahedral coordination state. It was observed that some antimony act as network former cations and some others act as bridges between any two adjacent polyhedra. At high antimony oxide content, the formation of some Sb-Fe bonds was also detected. The magnetic susceptibility measurements showed a maximum value when antimony oxide reached 15 mol %, but decreased with higher concentration. Between 20 mol % and 30 mol %, the magnetic susceptibility exhibited approximately stable value, indicating that at 15 mol % of antimony oxide content, most iron cations occupy the tetrahedral coordination state. The observed decrease in the magnetic susceptibility at higher concentrations {{may be due to the}} formation of some Sb-Fe bonds, which act to pair the iron d-electrons, in addition to the increase of Sb 2 O 3 content which has low magnetic properties. The obtained density and the calculated molar volume values showed approximately linear increase. The increase of the density can be attributed to the dierences in the molecular weights of both boron and <b>antimony</b> <b>oxides,</b> while the increase of the molar volume can be ascribed to the radius and the volume eects of the increasing antimony cations.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{treating}} concentrates with increasingly {{higher levels of}} arsenic and antimony {{is compounded by the}} trertd to stricter environmental guidelines regarding the disposal of smelter wastes. Much of the arsenic and antimony from non-ferrous processes is recovered as oxide fume. The options for handling these fumes include recycling them to the smelter, stabilising and disposing of them, and recovering values from them. Whilst arsenic oxide has little value, there is a market for <b>antimony</b> <b>oxide</b> and this provides an incentive for devising techniques for separating <b>antimony</b> <b>oxide</b> from arsenic oxide before disposal of the arsenic oxide. Arsenic can be separated from <b>antimony</b> <b>oxide</b> by selectively volatilising the more volatile arsenic trioxide from a mixed oxide sample or by selectively condensing the less volatile antimony tetroxide at high temperatures, leaving arsenic trioxide to condense out at lower temperatures. The results of selective volatilisation experiments at 379 to 587 degrees Celsius indicate {{that it is difficult to}} achieve an arsenic content below 5. 0 wt. % using air or nitrogen as carrier gas due to the formation of solid solutions between the two oxides.

Above 400 degreesC, mixed phase material was produced, with isolated crystallites of pure antimony becoming the dominant phase as the temperature was increased.

40|$|Atomic {{clusters}} {{are attractive}} candidates for building motifs for new nano-assembled materials with desirable properties. At this nano-regime of matter, the size, shape, {{and composition of}} clusters changes their electronic structure and hence their properties. Computational modeling must work {{hand in hand with}} experiment to provide robust descriptions of the geometries and energetics of atomic clusters and how they might behave in a nano-assembled material. To this end, we have investigated three distinct species as model systems: <b>antimony</b> <b>oxides</b> SbxOy (x = 1, 2; y = 0 - 3), metal ion-solvent complexes Mm(NH 3) n (M = Bi, Pb; m = 1 - 2, n = 0 - 4), and quantum dots Z 10 H 16 (Z = Si, Ge) and β-Sn 12 H 24. Their geometries and electronic structures have been determined using gradient-corrected density functional theory. The relative stabilities for <b>antimony</b> <b>oxides</b> have been examined by the respective comparison of highest-occupied and lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) gaps and atomization energies. The superior electronic stability of Sb 2 O 3 is indicated by its closed shell structure, wide HOMO-LUMO gap calculated to be 3. 11 eV, and high atomization energy of 4. 21 eV. Spin-orbit corrections were necessary for accurate calculation of the metal-solvent energetics, closing the gap between experimental and theoretical values by 1. 05 eV for the electron affinity of the Pb atom. Quantum dot modeling of the well-established Si and Ge as well as the less-investigated Sn illuminated the accuracy of the CEP basis sets and the B 3 LYP functional over other DFT computational routes for clusters containing elements beyond the third row. Throughout, the results correlate well with experiment and higher order ab initio methods where data is available. These comparisons validate the accuracy of the computational routes used.

No crystalline antimony oxide {{can be detected}} on catalysts even when <b>antimony</b> <b>oxides</b> loading reaches 20 wt. %. On Sb 2 O 3 /SiO 2 catalysts, the oxidation of highly dispersed Sb 3 + oxidic entities is more difficult than that of aggregated Sb 3 + oxidic entities. The concentration of Sb 5 + oxidic entities increases with Sb 2 O 3 loading and about half the amount of Sb 3 + oxidic entities can be oxidized to Sb 5 + oxidic entities on 20 wt. % Sb 2 O 3 /SiO 2 catalyst. On Sb 2 O 5 /SiO 2 catalysts, SbOx species are all Sb 5 + oxidic entities and aggregated SbOx species emerge as Sb 2 O 5 loading reaches 5 wt. %. In methane-selective oxidation, highly dispersed SbOx species are more active than aggregated SbOx species and the depression of deep oxidation towards CO 2 is more favorable on aggregated SbOx species than on highly dispersed SbOx species regardless of the oxidation state of Sb. Furthermore, highly dispersed Sb 3 + oxidic entities are more active than highly dispersed Sb 5 + oxidic entities. Such tendency {{is in line with}} that, for both Sb 2 O 3 /SiO 2 and Sb 2 O 5 /SiO 2 catalysts, the redox performance of aggregated SbOx species are poor compared to that of highly dispersed SbOx species.
