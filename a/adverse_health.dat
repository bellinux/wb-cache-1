5|$|Platinum {{is used in}} {{catalytic}} converters, laboratory equipment, {{electrical contacts}} and electrodes, platinum resistance thermometers, dentistry equipment, and jewelry. Being a heavy metal, it leads to health problems upon exposure to its salts; but due to its corrosion resistance, metallic platinum has not been linked to <b>adverse</b> <b>health</b> effects. Compounds containing platinum, such as cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin, are applied in chemotherapy against certain types of cancer.|$|E

Liliaceae are widely distributed, mainly in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and the flowers are insect pollinated. Many Liliaceae are important ornamental plants, widely grown for their attractive flowers and involved in a major floriculture of cut flowers and dry bulbs. Some species are poisonous if eaten and can have <b>adverse</b> <b>health</b> effects in humans and household pets.|$|E

One study estimated that 10 percent of the city's population suffered <b>adverse</b> <b>health</b> effects, such as stinging eyes, coughing, and respiratory distress. City health officials initially maintained that the smog had not caused any deaths. Later, a statistical analysis found that 168 people had likely died because of the smog.

5|$|Outcome {{is related}} to the extent and {{duration}} of lead exposure. Effects of lead on the physiology of the kidneys and blood are generally reversible; its effects on the central nervous system are not. While peripheral effects in adults often go away when lead exposure ceases, evidence suggests that most of lead's effects on a child's central nervous system are irreversible. Children with lead poisoning may thus have <b>adverse</b> <b>health,</b> cognitive, and behavioral effects that follow them into adulthood.|$|E
5|$|Soluble {{fluorides}} are moderately toxic: 5–10g sodium fluoride, or 32–64mg fluoride ions per kilogram of body mass, {{represents a}} lethal dose for adults. One-fifth of the lethal dose can cause <b>adverse</b> <b>health</b> effects, and chronic excess consumption {{may lead to}} skeletal fluorosis, which affects millions in Asia and Africa. Ingested fluoride forms hydrofluoric acid in the stomach which is easily absorbed by the intestines, where it crosses cell membranes, binds with calcium and interferes with various enzymes, before urinary excretion. Exposure limits are determined by urine testing of the body's ability to clear fluoride ions.|$|E

5|$|Anaemia {{is a major}} {{global health}} problem for women. Women are {{affected}} more than men, in which up to 30% of women being found to be anaemic and 42% of pregnant women. Anaemia is linked {{to a number of}} <b>adverse</b> <b>health</b> outcomes including a poor pregnancy outcome and impaired cognitive function (decreased concentration and attention). The main cause of anaemia is iron deficiency. In United States women iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) affects 37% of pregnant women, but globally the prevalence is as high as 80%. IDA starts in adolescence, from excess menstrual blood loss, compounded by the increased demand for iron in growth and suboptimal dietary intake. In the adult woman, pregnancy leads to further iron depletion.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium is {{a health}} and safety issue for workers. Exposure to {{beryllium}} in the workplace {{can lead to a}} sensitization immune response and can over time develop chronic beryllium disease (CBD). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States researches these effects in collaboration with a major manufacturer of beryllium products. The goal of this research is to prevent sensitization and CBD by developing {{a better understanding of the}} work processes and exposures that may present a potential risk for workers, and to develop effective interventions that will reduce the risk for <b>adverse</b> <b>health</b> effects. NIOSH also conducts genetic research on sensitization and CBD, independently of this collaboration. The NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods contains methods for measuring occupational exposures to beryllium.|$|E

5|$|While {{defended by}} those {{cultures}} {{in which it}} constitutes a tradition, FGC is opposed by many medical and cultural organizations {{on the grounds that}} it is unnecessary and harmful. Short term health effects may include hemorrhage, infection, sepsis, and even result in death, while long term effects include dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, vaginitis and cystitis. In addition FGC leads to complications with pregnancy, labor and delivery. Reversal (defibulation) by skilled personnel may be required to open the scarred tissue. Amongst those opposing the practice are local grassroots groups, and national and international organisations including WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and Amnesty International. Legislative efforts to ban FGC have rarely been successful and the preferred approach is education and empowerment and the provision of information about the <b>adverse</b> <b>health</b> effects as well the human rights aspects.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, a Massey University {{study in}} New Zealand {{concluded}} that sailors from the Royal Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy and Fijian Navy who observed the tests from nearby ships later suffered <b>adverse</b> <b>health</b> effects {{from exposure to}} radioactive fallout, including cancer and genetic abnormalities in the veterans' children. Various veterans' organisations filed a class action lawsuit against the UK Ministry of Defence following {{the publication of the}} study. The effects of radioactive fallout from the Grapple tests were researched by a 2010 British Government study that concluded the fallout did not reach concentrations that could affect the surrounding nature. The Ministry of Defence maintained that few people were exposed to any radiation or contamination at all, and that studies had shown little or no health effects. An analysis of illnesses in veterans of Grapple and other weapons tests produced statistics that are hard to interpret. The veterans showed rates of illness that were slightly higher than the control group, but the control group had lower rates of illness than the population as a whole while the veterans had rates that were about the same. Neither of these results has a clear explanation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Intimate partner {{violence}} (IPV) {{is highly}} prevalent in Pakistan. Social support {{is associated with}} a reduced risk for violence and <b>adverse</b> mental <b>health.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the association between social support and the occurrence of IPV and <b>adverse</b> mental <b>health</b> among Pakistani women exposed to IPV, along with exploring help-seeking behaviour using qualitative interviews. Data from a cross-sectional survey of 759 women, aged 25 – 60, were analyzed using logistic regression. The results demonstrated that informal social support was associated with fewer occurrences of all forms of IPV and less likelihood of <b>adverse</b> mental <b>health</b> when exposed to psychological violence, whereas formal social support was associated with more occurrences of all forms of IPV and more likelihood of <b>adverse</b> mental <b>health</b> when exposed to psychological violence. The qualitative result showed that fear of social stigma and low autonomy were, among others, obstacles for seeking help. Suggestions for future interventions include strengthening informal social networks and expanding formal resources, as well as raising awareness of IPV in order to address the issue.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Homophobic school climates {{are related}} to {{increased}} experiences of homophobic bullying and discrimination for sexual minority youth (SMY), ultimately leading to increased risk of <b>adverse</b> mental <b>health</b> outcomes, including depression and suicidality. The purpose of this project is to determine if LGBTQ-inclusive sex education has protective effects against <b>adverse</b> mental <b>health</b> outcomes and bullying experiences in youth, particularly SMY. METHODS: This study involved secondary data analysis of representative data from the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey and the 2014 School Health Profiles. Multilevel logistic models were constructed to determine if individuals in states with higher proportions of schools teaching LGBT-inclusive sex education have lower odds of reporting being bullied in school and experiencing <b>adverse</b> mental <b>health</b> outcomes, including depressive symptoms, seriously considering suicide, and making a suicide plan. RESULTS: Initial analyses indicated that after controlling for demographics and state-level covariates (i. e. presence of LGBTQ anti-discrimination policies, median household income, and population density of same-sex couples), lesbian and gay youth in states with higher proportions of schools teaching LGBT-inclusive sex education had significantly lower odds of experiencing bullying in school (Odds Ratio: 0. 83; 95...|$|R
