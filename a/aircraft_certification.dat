25|$|In 1960, Bianchi {{had created}} a one-off Vickers 22 (Blériot type) Monoplane, using Vickers Company {{drawings}} intended for the Vickers Flying Club in 1910. 20th Century Fox purchased the completed replica although it required a new engine and modifications including replacing the wooden fuselage structure with welded steel tubing as well as incorporating ailerons instead of wing-warping. The Vickers 22 became the final type used by the Italian contestant. Sometime after the film wrapped, the Vickers was sold to a buyer in New Zealand.
