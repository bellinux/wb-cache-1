5|$|Areoles are {{structures}} {{unique to}} cacti. Although variable, they typically appear as woolly or hairy <b>areas</b> <b>on</b> the stems from which spines emerge. Flowers are also produced from areoles. In the genus Pereskia, believed {{similar to the}} ancestor of all cacti, the areoles occur in the axils of leaves (i.e. in the angle between the leaf stalk and the stem). In leafless cacti, areoles are often borne on raised <b>areas</b> <b>on</b> the stem where leaf bases would have been.|$|E

5|$|The Cuban iguana is {{naturally}} distributed in rocky coastal <b>areas</b> <b>on</b> Cuba and throughout {{as many as}} 4,000 islets surrounding the Cuban mainland, including Isla de la Juventud off the southern coast, which {{has one of the}} most robust populations. Relatively safe populations are found on some islets along the north and south coasts and in isolated protected <b>areas</b> <b>on</b> the mainland. These include Guanahacabibes Biosphere Reserve in the west, Desembarco del Granma National Park, Hatibonico Wildlife Refuge, Punta Negra-Quemados Ecological Reserve, and Delta del Cauto Wildlife Refuge, all in eastern Cuba. Because of this wide distribution, accurate information about the number of distinct subpopulations of Cuban iguanas cannot be determined. The population on the US Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay has been estimated at 2,000 to 3,000 individuals, and the animals are treated well and protected by US forces stationed at the base. An unusual incident occurred when a detainee in the prison assaulted a guard with a bloody tail torn from a Cuban iguana in May 2005.|$|E
