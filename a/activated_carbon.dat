Animal studies indicate the amatoxins deplete hepatic glutathione; N-acetylcysteine serves as a glutathione precursor and may therefore prevent reduced glutathione levels and subsequent liver damage. None of the antidotes used have undergone prospective, randomized clinical trials, and only anecdotal support is available. Silibinin and N-acetylcysteine appear to be the therapies with the most potential benefit. Repeated doses of <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> may be helpful by absorbing any toxins returned to the gastrointestinal tract following enterohepatic circulation. Other methods of enhancing the elimination of the toxins have been trialed; techniques such as hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, and peritoneal dialysis have occasionally yielded success, but overall do not appear to improve outcome.|$|E

The optimum activation temperature for physical activation is 800 oC and for chemical activation is 550 oC. The <b>activated</b> <b>carbons</b> produced also loaded with different metal oxides (BaO, MgO, CuO, TiO 2 and CeO 2). Both loaded and unloaded <b>activated</b> <b>carbons</b> are characterized using ultimate analysis, BET surface area measurement method, fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis and x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The BET surface area and pore volumes {{showed that the}} <b>activated</b> <b>carbons</b> prepared from PKS by chemical activation (PCAC) and from CS by physical activation (CPAC) {{were found to be}} much higher than others <b>activated</b> <b>carbons.</b> Hence, the metal oxides were loaded on these two <b>activated</b> <b>carbons.</b> The loaded and unloaded <b>activated</b> <b>carbons</b> produced will be tested for application of CO 2 adsorption from the simulated flue gas...|$|R

The Impregnation ratio, temperature and time of activation were modified to obtain <b>activated</b> <b>carbons</b> with different characteristics. Regarding {{the characteristics of the}} <b>activated</b> <b>carbons,</b> the effects of porous structure and surface chemistry on the toluene adsorption capacity from toluene isotherms have been analysed. Results show that the control of properties of the <b>activated</b> <b>carbons,</b> particularly porous structure, highly dependent on the preparation conditions, plays a decisive role on the toluene adsorption capacity of the <b>activated</b> <b>carbons.</b> Concerning the experiments of toluene adsorption conducted in dynamic mode, <b>activated</b> <b>carbons</b> prepared at low temperatures of activation show higher breakthrough times than those obtained for <b>activated</b> <b>carbons</b> prepared at higher activation temperatures. The amount of toluene adsorbed in presence of water vapor in the gas stream lead to a decrease ranging from 33 to 46 % except for carbons prepared at higher temperatures activated that show only a slight decrease in the amount of toluene adsorbed. <b>Activated</b> <b>carbons</b> can be regenerated with soft heat treatment showing a slight decrease in the adsorption capacity.

The ortho/para ratio in condensed H2 is an important consideration in the preparation and storage of liquid hydrogen: the conversion from ortho to para is exothermic and produces enough heat to evaporate some of the hydrogen liquid, leading to loss of liquefied material. Catalysts for the ortho-para interconversion, such as ferric oxide, <b>activated</b> <b>carbon,</b> platinized asbestos, rare earth metals, uranium compounds, chromic oxide, or some nickel compounds, are used during hydrogen cooling.|$|E
5|$|Boron trifluoride and trichloride {{are used}} as {{catalysts}} in organic synthesis and electronics; the tribromide {{is used in the}} manufacture of diborane. Non-toxic boron ligands could replace toxic phosphorus ligands in some transition metal catalysts. Silica sulfuric acid (SiO2OSO3H) is used in organic reactions. Germanium dioxide is sometimes used as a catalyst in the production of PET plastic for containers; cheaper antimony compounds, such as the trioxide or triacetate, are more commonly employed for the same purpose despite concerns about antimony contamination of food and drinks. Arsenic trioxide has been used in the production of natural gas, to boost the removal of carbon dioxide, as have selenous acid and tellurous acid. Selenium acts as a catalyst in some microorganisms. Tellurium, and its dioxide and tetrachloride, are strong catalysts for air oxidation of carbon above 500°C.

5|$|The {{amorphous}} form is {{an assortment}} of carbon atoms in a non-crystalline, irregular, glassy state, not held in a crystalline macrostructure. It is present as a powder, and is the main constituent of substances such as charcoal, lampblack (soot) and <b>activated</b> <b>carbon.</b> At normal pressures, carbon {{takes the form of}} graphite, in which each atom is bonded trigonally to three others in a plane composed of fused hexagonal rings, just like those in aromatic hydrocarbons. The resulting network is 2-dimensional, and the resulting flat sheets are stacked and loosely bonded through weak van der Waals forces. This gives graphite its softness and its cleaving properties (the sheets slip easily past one another). Because of the delocalization of one of the outer electrons of each atom to form a π-cloud, graphite conducts electricity, but only in the plane of each covalently bonded sheet. This results in a lower bulk electrical conductivity for carbon than for most metals. The delocalization also accounts for the energetic stability of graphite over diamond at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves of}} red maple, {{especially}} when dead or wilted, are extremely toxic to horses. The toxin is unknown, but {{believed to be}} an oxidant because it damages red blood cells, causing acute oxidative hemolysis that inhibits the transport of oxygen. This not only decreases oxygen delivery to all tissues, but also leads {{to the production of}} methemoglobin, which can further damage the kidneys. The ingestion of 700grams (1.5 pounds) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) is lethal. Symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression, lethargy, increased rate and depth of breathing, increased heart rate, jaundice, dark brown urine, colic, laminitis, coma, and death. Treatment is limited and can include the use of methylene blue or mineral oil and <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach, as well as blood transfusions, fluid support, diuretics, and anti-oxidants such as Vitamin C. About 50% to 75% of affected horses die or are euthanized as a result.|$|E
5|$|The sugar may {{be transported}} in bulk {{to the country}} {{where it will be}} used and the {{refining}} process often takes place there. The first stage is known as affination and involves immersing the sugar crystals in a concentrated syrup that softens and removes the sticky brown coating without dissolving them. The crystals are then separated from the liquor and dissolved in water. The resulting syrup is treated either by a carbonatation or by a phosphatation process. Both involve the precipitation of a fine solid in the syrup and when this is filtered out, many of the impurities are removed at the same time. Removal of color is achieved by using either a granular <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> or an ion-exchange resin. The sugar syrup is concentrated by boiling and then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals, causing the sugar to crystallize out. The liquor is spun off in a centrifuge and the white crystals are dried in hot air and ready to be packaged or used. The surplus liquor is made into refiners' molasses.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe main {{objective}} of this work is to study the influence of inorganic compounds employed in the synthesis of L-type <b>activated</b> <b>carbons</b> on photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 in 4 -chlorophenol photodegradation. Different <b>activated</b> <b>carbons</b> were prepared from Tabebuia pentaphyla wood impregnated with ZnCl 2, H 3 PO 4 and KOH. Activation was performed under N 2 flow at 450 °C by 1 h. Results clearly indicate differences in the photoactivity of TiO 2 which depends of physicochemical properties of <b>activated</b> <b>carbons</b> that {{are influenced by the}} concentration of the chemical substance. Kinetic results of 4 -chlorophenol photodegradation show a synergistic effect between both solids and in certain cases the inhibition of TiO 2 photoactivity.
