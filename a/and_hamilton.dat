5|$|Hamilton Street {{has served}} as the main street in Allentown since the {{community}} was founded in the 18th century. Hamilton Street <b>and</b> <b>Hamilton</b> Boulevard became part of the William Penn Highway in 1916, PA 3 in 1924, and US 22 in 1926. In 1931, US 22 was routed to a new alignment to the north, <b>and</b> <b>Hamilton</b> Boulevard <b>and</b> <b>Hamilton</b> Street west of 15th Street became a part of US 222. In the 1950s, US 222 was rerouted to bypass Allentown, leaving Hamilton Boulevard <b>and</b> <b>Hamilton</b> Street through the city unnumbered. In 1984, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation proposed extending US 222 from I-78/PA 309 to downtown Allentown, where it would end at PA 145. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) rejected extending US 222 into Allentown, and PA 222 was instead designated to run between I-78/PA 309 and US 222 and PA 145 in 1991.|$|E

5|$|Heavy {{rain from}} Typhoon Phanfone made the track surface wet and reduced visibility. Starting {{from behind the}} safety car, the race was stopped after two laps and resumed 20 minutes later. Rosberg {{immediately}} fended off a passing manoeuvre by Hamilton heading into the first corner. His car then experienced oversteer, <b>and</b> <b>Hamilton</b> reduced the time deficit between them. Hamilton challenged Rosberg for the lead {{over the next four}} laps, overtook him on the 29th lap and pulled away. Jules Bianchi made contact with the rear of a tractor crane at Dunlop Curve on the 43rd lap that was tending to Adrian Sutil's car (which had crashed one lap earlier) and the race was prematurely ended three laps later. The race result was counted back two laps, <b>and</b> <b>Hamilton</b> was declared the winner.|$|E

Clarke <b>and</b> <b>Hamilton</b> pleaded the French scholars' case to Hutchinson, who finally agreed that items such as natural history specimens would be the scholars' private property. Menou quickly claimed the stone, too, as his private property. Hutchinson was equally aware of the stone's unique value, and rejected Menou's claim. Eventually an agreement was reached, and the transfer of the objects was incorporated into the Capitulation of Alexandria signed by representatives of the British, French, and Ottoman forces.|$|E
