40|$|Summary. -The {{effect of}} 10 % glucose {{solution}} and narcosis upon the blood borne cancer cells was studied on Wistar rats, with Walker 256 carcinosarcoma inoculated intravenously. Our experiment reveals obvious {{differences between the}} control group and the groups treated with glucose concerning incidence, localization and tumour extension, differences which {{suggest that there is}} a risk in using glucose in the intra- and post-surgical resuscitation of patients with cancer. IMPROVEMENT in surgical techniques, the discovery of antibiotics and advances in <b>anaesthesia</b> <b>and</b> <b>resuscitation</b> have reduced the rate of post-surgical mortality and brought surgical treatment to the forefront of therapy for some kinds of tumour (Chiricuta et al., 1972).

40|$|Introduction. Cost of anaesthesiology {{represent}} defined {{measures to}} determine a precise profile of expenditure estimation of surgical treatment, which is important regarding planning of healthcare activities, prices and budget. Objective. In {{order to determine the}} actual value of anaestesiological services, we started with the analysis of activity based costing (ABC) analysis. Methods. Retrospectively, in 2005 and 2006, we estimated the direct costs of anestesiological services (salaries, drugs, supplying materials and other: analyses and equipment.) of the Institute of <b>Anaesthesia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Resuscitation</b> of the Clinical Centre of Serbia. The group included all anesthetized patients of both sexes and all ages. We compared direct costs with direct expenditure, “each cost object (service or unit) ” of the Republican Health-care Insurance. The Summary data of the Departments of Anaesthesia documented in the database of the Clinical Centre of Serbia. Numerical data were utilized and the numerical data were estimated and analyzed by computer programs Microsoft Office Excel 2003 and SPSS for Windows. We compared using the linear model of direct costs and unit costs of anaesthesiological services from the Costs List of the Republican Health-care Insurance. Results. Direct costs showed 40 % of costs were spent on salaries, (32 % on drugs and supplies, and 28 % on other costs, such as analyses and equipment. The correlation of the direct costs of anaestesiological services showed a linear correlation with the unit costs of the Republican Healthcare Insurance. Conclusion. During surgery, costs of anaesthesia would increase by 10 % the surgical treatment cost of patients. Regarding the actual costs of drugs and supplies, we do not see any possibility of costs reduction. Fixed elements of direct costs provide the possibility of rationalization of resources in anaesthesia...|$|E
40|$|Polytrauma is {{an injury}} {{of one or}} more organic systems or body areas the mutual {{combination}} and extent of which may lead to direct death threat. Polytrauma stands on the first step of the mortality ladder particularly among those of 1 45 years of age. Not only timely emergency care, but also professional quality of the care play important role here. Treatment of a patient with polytrauma requires quality performance of physically and psychically demanding work The aim of the thesis was 1 : To find out whether nurses at an ARD, an ICU and a standard department have knowledge of nursing care of a patient with polytrauma. 2 : To find out the specifics of nursing care of a patient with polytrauma at an ARD, an ICU and a standard department. 3 : To find out the differences in nursing care of a patient with polytrauma at an ARD, an ICU and a standard department. Research questions: 1. Where do ARD nurses see the biggest problems of nursing care of a patient with polytrauma? 2. Where do ICU nurses see the biggest problems of nursing care of a patient with polytrauma? 3. Where do nurses from a standard department see the biggest problems of nursing care of a patient with polytrauma? 4. How do ARD nurses care of a patient with polytrauma? 5 : How do ICU nurses care of a patient with polytrauma? 6 : How do nurses from a standard department care of a patient with polytrauma? 7 : What opportunities for education in nursing care of a patient with polytrauma do ARD nurses have? 8 : What opportunities for education in nursing care of a patient with polytrauma do ICU nurses have? 9 : What opportunities for education in nursing care of a patient with polytrauma do nurses from a standard department have? Qualitative research was applied to preparation of the thesis. Non-structured interview and involved observation were the data collection methods. The research was performed at an <b>anaesthesia</b> <b>and</b> <b>resuscitation</b> department, at an intensive care unit and at a standard traumatology department. The research was anonymous. The research has shown that ARD and ICU nurses as well as those at the standard department are aware of treatment of patients with polytrauma. We observed that they cared about patients' needs and all activities they perform comply with nursing care standards. They are aware of complications that might occur in a polytraumatized patient. We have also found that mainly the difference in communication with a patient belongs to the specifics of the above mentioned departments. The results also show that the care provided at the ARD and the ICU is acute, while the standard department mostly provides subsequent care. We found that the biggest difference in treatment of patients with polytrauma at the above departments is in communication with a patient. Communication is at the minimum at ARD, where work with monitors prevails. Nurses of the ICU and the standard department cope with different problems. These are lack of space and electronic equipment at the ICU. The care of a patient with polytrauma who is not self-sufficient and requires permanent care and attention of a nurse is physically and psychically demanding at a standard department. It is not sufficient according to the nurses. The problem is in their opinion in high number of patients, lack of beds, extensive attention to some patients and last but not least the growing administration conducted by nurses. This brings the problems in nurse-patient communication at a standard department. The nurses are {{aware of the fact that}} effective communication has positive impact on patient recovery as it moderates pain and confusion and helps against anxiety and stress, helps relieve pain, reduce complications and accelerate convalescence. It would be interesting to prepare a seminar for the ARD, ICU and standard department healthcare staff to improve nursing care of a patient with polytrauma in relation to that...|$|E
30|$|Venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) has {{a significant}} clinical and social impact due to its high incidence and severe possible sequelae. Pulmonary embolism (PE), with or without concomitant measurable deep vein thrombosis (DVT), is the direct cause of roughly 10  % of hospital deaths [1]. Although anticoagulant prophylaxis for VTE has been routine practice for a long time, {{the literature on the}} subject is by no means comprehensive and unequivocal, especially in orthopaedic and trauma surgery. This prompted SISET (the Italian Association for the Study of Haemostasis and Thrombosis), SIOT (the Italian Association of Orthopaedics and Traumatology), OTODI (the Italian Association of Hospital Orthopaedics and Traumatology) and SIAARTI (the Italian Society of <b>Anaesthesia,</b> Analgesia, <b>Resuscitation</b> <b>and</b> Intensive Care) to set up a working group in 2009 to define an inter-association consensus statement providing practical recommendations for the daily management of VTE prophylaxis in hip and knee replacement surgeries and the treatment of femoral neck fractures.|$|R

40|$|Polytraumatised {{patients}} with haemorrhagic shock {{are prone to}} develop systemic complications, such as SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome), ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and MOF (multiple organ failure). The pathomechanism of severe complications following trauma is multifactorial, and {{it is believed that}} microcirculatory dysfunction plays an important role. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the changes in the microcirculation in musculature over time during shock <b>and</b> subsequent <b>resuscitation</b> in a porcine model of haemorrhagic shock and polytrauma. Twelve pigs (German Landrace) underwent femur fracture, liver laceration, blunt chest trauma and haemorrhagic shock under standard <b>anaesthesia</b> <b>and</b> intensive care monitoring. Microcirculation data were measured from the vastus lateralis muscle using a combined white light spectrometry and laser spectroscopy system every 15 minutes during the shock <b>and</b> <b>resuscitation</b> period, <b>and</b> at 24, 48 and 72 hours. Oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption were calculated and compared to baseline. The relative haemoglobin, local oxygen consumption and saturation values in the microcirculation were observed significantly lower during shock, however, no changes in the microcirculatory blood flow and microcirculatory oxygen delivery were observed. After resuscitation, the microcirculatory blood flow and relative haemoglobin increased and remained elevated during the whole observation period (72 hours). In this study, we observed changes in microcirculation during the trauma and shock phases. Furthermore, we also measured persistent dysfunction of the microcirculation over the observation period of three days after <b>resuscitation</b> <b>and</b> haemorrhagic shock.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} and evaluate an experimental model of neonatal normocapnic hypoxia <b>and</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> Methods: Ten male Landrace/Large White neonatal piglets were studied. Following <b>anaesthesia</b> <b>and</b> intubation, the animals were mechanically ventilated. Surgical procedures included catheterization of the right internal jugular vein and the carotid artery. After stabilization with 21 % O- 2, normocapnic hypoxia was induced by decreasing the inspired O- 2 to 6 - 8 %. When piglets developed bradycardia (heart rate < 60 beats/min), reoxygenation was initiated by administering 21 % O- 2. Arterial blood samples were taken during baseline, hypoxia and reoxygenation in order to measure interleukine- 6 and interleukine- 8. Results: Nine out of ten animals were successfully resuscitated (one of these required chest compressions and a dose of adrenaline) and one died despite resuscitation efforts. After returning to baseline haemodynamic values, euthanasia was performed using thiopental overdose. Conclusions: Haemodynamic fluctuations at baseline, during normocapnic hypoxia and reoxygenation in Landrace/Large White piglets are comparable to that in human neonates, making the breed a favorable model of human neonatal hypoxia investigation...|$|R
