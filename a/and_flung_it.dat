25|$|According to folklore, notably {{celebrated by}} a statue {{in front of}} the town hall, the city got its name from a legend about a giant called Antigoon who lived near the Scheldt river. He exacted a toll from passing boatmen, and for those who refused, he severed one of their hands and threw it into the river. Eventually the giant was killed by a young hero named Silvius Brabo, who cut off the giant's own hand <b>and</b> <b>flung</b> <b>it</b> into the river. Hence the name Antwerpen, from Dutch hand werpen, akin to Old English hand and wearpan (to throw), which has evolved to today's warp.|$|E

60|$|But what k was {{we never}} shall know, for Angelica, in a rage, cried, 'Get out, you saucy, rude creature! How dare you {{to remind me}} of your rudeness? As for your little trumpery twopenny ring, there, sir, there!' <b>And</b> she <b>flung</b> <b>it</b> out of the window.|$|R

60|$|So saying, he {{plucked the}} {{gauntlet}} off his right hand, <b>and</b> <b>flung</b> <b>it</b> {{down on the}} floor of the hall.|$|E
60|$|But Koogah, shoving Nam-Bok {{clear of}} the beach, tore the shawl from her {{shoulders}} <b>and</b> <b>flung</b> <b>it</b> into the bidarka.|$|E

60|$|Ere long, however, his {{emotions}} took a sterner and a darker hue. The {{sight of the}} animal wearied him, <b>and</b> he <b>flung</b> <b>it</b> contemptuously aside.
