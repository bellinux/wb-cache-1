5|$|Cocaine {{was already}} so {{prevalent}} {{on the set}} (like many other film productions of that era) that Aykroyd, who used far less than his partner, claims {{a section of the}} budget was actually set aside for purchases of the drug during night shooting. The stars had a private bar, the Blues Club, built on the set, for themselves, crew, and friends. Carrie Fisher, Aykroyd's girlfriend at the time, says most of the bar's staff doubled as dealers, procuring <b>any</b> <b>drug</b> patrons desired.|$|E

On April 17 the plea was made public when Debora Green appeared in court to plead no contest to five charges—two counts of capital murder, one of arson, and two of attempted first-degree murder. In exchange for avoiding the death penalty, the no contest plea called for Green to accept a prison sentence of a minimum of forty years {{without the possibility of}} parole.

25|$|Importing and {{exporting}} of any classified drug is {{a serious}} offence. The penalty can run up to 12 to 16 years if it is hard drug trade, maximum 4 years for import or export of large quantities of cannabis. It is prohibited to operate a motor vehicle while {{under the influence of}} <b>any</b> <b>drug</b> that affects driving ability {{to such an extent that}} you are unable to drive properly. (Section 8 of the 1994 Road Traffic Act section 1). The Dutch police have the right to do a drug test if they suspect influenced driving. For example, anybody involved in a traffic accident may be tested. Causing an accident that inflicts bodily harm, while under influence of <b>any</b> <b>drug,</b> is seen as a crime that may be punished by up to 3 years in prison (9 years in case of a fatal accident). Suspension of driving license is also normal in such a case (maximum 5 years). Schiphol, a large international airport near Amsterdam, has long practiced a zero tolerance policy regarding airline passengers carrying drugs. In 2006 there were 20,769 drug crimes registered by public prosecutors and 4,392 persons received an unconditional prison sentence The rate of imprisonment for drug crimes is about the same as in Sweden, which has a zero tolerance policy for drug crimes.|$|E

25|$|Addiction to alcohol, as with <b>any</b> <b>drug</b> {{of abuse}} tested so far, has been {{correlated}} with an enduring {{reduction in the}} expression of GLT1 (EAAT2) in the nucleus accumbens and is implicated in the drug-seeking behavior expressed nearly universally across all documented addiction syndromes. This long-term dysregulation of glutamate transmission is associated {{with an increase in}} vulnerability to both relapse-events after re-exposure to drug-use triggers as well as an overall increase in the likelihood of developing addiction to other reinforcing drugs. Drugs which help to re-stabilize the glutamate system such as N-acetylcysteine have been proposed for the treatment of addiction to cocaine, nicotine, and alcohol.|$|E
25|$|The same act also {{introduced}} more stringent controls with higher criminal penalties for offenses involving the illegal distribution of AAS and human growth hormone. By the early 1990s, after AAS were scheduled in the U.S., several pharmaceutical companies stopped manufacturing or marketing the {{products in the}} U.S., including Ciba, Searle, Syntex, and others. In the Controlled Substances Act, AAS are defined to be <b>any</b> <b>drug</b> or hormonal substance chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than estrogens, progestins, and corticosteroids) that promote muscle growth. The act was amended by the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004, which added prohormones {{to the list of}} controlled substances, with effect from January 20, 2005.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} period, {{the use of}} {{medications}} during pregnancy was not strictly controlled, and drugs were not thoroughly tested for potential harm to the fetus.

There soon appeared reports of findings of abnormalities in children being born, traced back {{to the use of the}} drug thalidomide. In late 1959, it was noticed that peripheral neuritis developed in patients who took the drug over a period of time, and it was only after this point that thalidomide ceased to be provided over the counter.|$|E

500|$|Although {{several people}} {{expressed}} {{the opinion that}} Mike Jeffrey had set Hendrix up {{in an effort to}} control him and create dependency, Shapiro and Glebbeek dispute this theory based on Jeffrey's severe risk of significant financial shortfall had Hendrix been convicted. Jeffrey's assistant, Trixie Sullivan, speculated that the drugs had been planted by a fan who became disgruntled after Hendrix refused his sexual advance. Both Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding later wrote in their autobiographies that the entire Hendrix entourage had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto; both men also stated that they believed the incident had been set up and that the drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag. According to author Ritchie Unterberger, although Hendrix [...] "took his fair share of drugs", the commonly accepted view is that he did not use heroin regularly and was not an addict; his drug use was typical of his peers, but not excessive. Mitchell wrote: [...] "Contrary to what some people have said, Jimi was never a junkie– that is he was never addicted to <b>any</b> <b>drug,</b> particularly heroin, which he tried once or twice but didn't like." ...|$|E
500|$|Mephedrone {{is one of}} {{hundreds}} of designer drugs or legal highs that have been reported in recent years, including artificial chemicals such as synthetic cannabis and semisynthetic substances such as methylhexanamine. These drugs are primarily developed to avoid being controlled by laws against illegal drugs, thus giving them the label of designer drugs. According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, the synthesis of mephedrone was first reported in 1929 by Saem de Burnaga Sanchez in the Bulletin de la Société Chimique de France, under the name [...] "toluyl-alpha-monomethylaminoethylcetone", but the compound remained an obscure product of academia until 2003, when it was [...] "re-discovered" [...] and publicised by an underground chemist on The Hive website, working under the pseudonym [...] "Kinetic". Kinetic posted on the site, [...] "I’ve been bored {{over the last couple of}} days and had a few fun reagents lying around, so I thought I’d try and make some 1-(4-methylphenyl)-2-methylaminopropanone hydrochloride, or 4-methylmethcathinone." [...] before going on to describe that after taking it, the user had a [...] "fantastic sense of well-being that I haven’t got from <b>any</b> <b>drug</b> before except my beloved Ecstasy." [...] In interviews Kinetic was described as [...] "a mathematician who used to design sleeping pills for a major pharmaceutical company" [...] and he stated that he was based in Israel when he rediscovered mephedrone.|$|E
