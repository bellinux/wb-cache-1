5|$|In {{the band}}'s fourth album, 2011's The Here and Now, the band {{set out to}} mix their typical sounds with the music they were {{listening}} to at the time. The response was polarising. During the publicity for The Here and Now, the band praised it as <b>a</b> <b>progression</b> for them; {{they did not want}} to reject an album they had just released. But their own lack of belief in the record and their growing concern that they were irrelevant started to severely affect the band's confidence in themselves and their style.|$|E
5|$|The Itanium {{processors}} show <b>a</b> <b>progression</b> in capability. Merced was a {{proof of}} concept. McKinley dramatically improved the memory hierarchy and allowed Itanium to become reasonably competitive. Madison, with {{the shift to}} a 130nm process, allowed for enough cache space to overcome the major performance bottlenecks. Montecito, with a 90nm process, allowed for a dual-core implementation and a major improvement in performance per watt. Montvale added three new features: core-level lockstep, demand-based switching and front-side bus frequency of up to 667MHz.|$|E

5|$|During {{the period}} 2000–500 BCE, {{in terms of}} culture, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic to the Iron Age. The Vedas, the oldest scriptures {{associated}} with Hinduism, were composed during this period, and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain. Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west. The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labeling their occupations impure, arose during this period. On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests {{the existence of a}} chiefdom stage of political organisation. In South India, <b>a</b> <b>progression</b> to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period, as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.|$|E
5|$|Just Cause 2 is a third-person action-adventure game {{in which}} players control Rico Rodriguez, a major {{operative}} of the Agency, {{in an effort to}} overthrow the island dictatorship of Panau: an open world for players to explore. The game has three types of missions. Agency missions advance the story and are the game's main campaign; faction missions task players to assist the game's three factions, and stronghold missions task players to infiltrate government bases and liberate them for the factions. To advance through the campaign missions a player must earn chaos points, <b>a</b> <b>progression</b> system introduced in the game. Players earn chaos points for completing missions and destroying designated government property. As the number of chaos points increases, the factions gain influence and the government begins to collapse. In addition to typical missions, Just Cause 2 has race challenges which give players cash.|$|E
5|$|Miller and Pflueger were {{selected}} in 1923 {{to build an}} expansive new headquarters tower for Pacific Telephone & Telegraph. In June 1924, Pflueger showed his plans for a $3million skyscraper, 26 stories high, designed with continuous vertical elements and <b>a</b> <b>progression</b> of step-backs narrowing the floors near the top. Arthur Frank Mathews {{was brought in to}} paint a mural in the boardroom on the 18th floor. The structure was fully devoted to offices for 2,000 employees, mostly female. Pflueger's vision was strongly influenced by Eliel Saarinen's second-place entry in the competition to design the Tribune Tower in Chicago. In June, 1925, the Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company Building was completed for $4million ($million in current value), becoming the tallest building in San Francisco for the next 40 years, tied by the Russ Building in 1927.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} for A + A to be of comparable size to A if A is <b>an</b> arithmetic <b>progression,</b> and it {{is possible}} for A · A to be of comparable size to A if A is <b>a</b> geometric <b>progression.</b> The Erdős-Szemerédi theorem can thus be viewed as an assertion that it is not possible for a large set to behave like <b>an</b> arithmetic <b>progression</b> and as <b>a</b> geometric <b>progression</b> simultaneously. It can also be viewed as an assertion that the real line does not contain any set resembling a finite subring or finite subfield; it is the first example of what is now known as the sum-product phenomenon, which is now known to hold {{in a wide variety of}} rings and fields, including finite fields.|$|R

5|$|No formal {{educational}} {{method was}} applied to the production, and no attempt was made to follow the official UK National Curriculum for primary school history. The show's creators were acutely aware of educational possibilities, but—in line with Deary's overall mandate for the franchise—saw their basic role as popularising history, inspiring further curiosity about the academic subject rather than attempting to teach it seriously. The show's effectiveness in this respect was endorsed by historical scholars, including presenter Dan Snow. Writing in The Independent, Gerard Gilbert notes that Horrible Histories is part of an extensive British black-comedy tradition not only in adult but also in children's programming. In later series, as usable material from the books began to run out, there was <b>a</b> <b>progression</b> towards more sophisticated, adult sketches in terms of both creativity and educational content, as the show began relying on material that their younger viewers would be less familiar with.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes {{the text}} {{can give a}} basic outline that {{correlates}} to the four-movement scheme of a symphony. For instance, the four-part structure of Edgar Allan Poe's The Bells, <b>a</b> <b>progression</b> from youth to marriage, maturity, and death, naturally suggested the four movements of a symphony to Sergei Rachmaninoff, which he followed in his choral symphony of the same name. The text can encourage a composer to expand a choral symphony past the normal bounds of the symphonic genre, as with Berlioz for his Roméo et Juliette, yet stay within the basic structural or aesthetic intent of symphonic form. It can also influence the musical content in parts {{where there is no}} singing, as in Roméo et Juliette. There, Berlioz allows the orchestra to express the majority of the drama in instrumental music and saves words for expository and narrative sections of the work.|$|E

5|$|General Nguyễn Khánh {{had come}} to power in January 1964 after {{surprising}} the ruling junta of General Dương Văn Minh in a bloodless coup. However, due to American pressure, he kept the popular Minh as a token head of state, while concentrating real power in his hands by controlling the Military Revolutionary Council. In August, the Vietnam War continued to escalate following the Gulf of Tonkin incident, a disputed encounter between communist and American naval vessels off the North Vietnamese coast; Washington accused North Vietnam of attacking their ships in international waters. Khánh saw the tense situation {{as an opportunity to}} increase his authority. On August 7, he declared a state of emergency, increased police powers, banned protests, tightened censorship and allowed the police arbitrary search and imprisonment powers. He drafted a new constitution, which would have augmented his personal power {{at the expense of the}} already-limited Minh. However, these moves only served to weaken Khánh as large demonstrations and riots broke out in the cities, with majority Buddhists prominent, calling for an end to the state of emergency and the abandonment of the new constitution, as well as <b>a</b> <b>progression</b> back to civilian rule.|$|E
5|$|The sky bears overt metaphorical {{significance}} {{and is the}} centrepiece of the painting's symbolism. Alexander, identified by the Egyptians and others as a god of the sun, finds his victory in the sun's rays; and the Persians are routed into the darkness beneath the crescent moon, {{a symbol of the}} Near East. Considered in terms of the painting's contemporary context, the sun's triumph over the moon represents Christendom's victory over the Islamism of the Ottomans. Eschatological meaning, probably inspired by prophecies in the Book of Daniel, is imbued in the heavenly setting. In particular, Daniel 7 predicts {{the rise and fall of}} four kingdoms before the Second Coming; these were thought to be Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome at the time of the painting's creation. Altdorfer saw the Battle of Issus as a principal indicator of the transition of power from Persia to Greece, and thus as an event of cosmic significance. The battle also marked <b>a</b> <b>progression</b> toward the end of the world – an important theological concern in the 16th century, given that the last traces of Rome were diminishing with the papacy. As a member of the Regensburg council and a practising Catholic, Altdorfer frequently interacted with the Church and was surely aware of this trend of eschatological thought. Schedel, too, had calculated that the final age of the seven he identified was nigh. It may therefore be inferred that the sky's expression of the momentous event at Issus was intended to be of contemporary relevance as well.|$|E
