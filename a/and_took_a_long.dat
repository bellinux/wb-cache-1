25|$|Medwin was 36 when {{he married}} <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> honeymoon at Vevey before {{settling}} to live in Florence. The union produced two daughters. Medwin settled into a life of style and substance amongst an English émigré community. Unfortunately he still lived beyond his means and lost considerable sums buying and selling Italian artworks. By 1829, when his father died, he was in dire financial straits, with creditors repossessing his goods. His marriage came under strain, and Medwin appears to have ducked his responsibilities and abandoned {{his wife and two}} daughters, leaving friends such as Trelawney and Charles Armitage Brown to sort out his and his wife's affairs.|$|E
25|$|Stanwyck and Taylor {{mutually}} {{decided in}} 1950 to divorce, {{and after his}} insistence, she proceeded with the official filing of the papers. There have been many rumors regarding the cause of their divorce, but after World War II, Taylor had attempted to create a life away from Hollywood, and Stanwyck did not share that goal. Taylor had romantic affairs, and there were unsubstantiated rumors about Stanwyck having had affairs as well. After the divorce, they acted together in Stanwyck's last feature film, The Night Walker (1964). She never remarried and cited Taylor as {{the love of her}} life, according to her friend and Big Valley co-star Linda Evans. She took his death in 1969 very hard, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> break from film and television work.|$|E
25|$|The final {{difficulty}} was {{the great}} parade of knights {{that was supposed to}} open the tournament at noon. The knights had had little practice mounting their horses <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to get prepared. Then each knight and his entourage (forty different groups) was supposed to ride to the castle, pick up a lady, officer or knight, and return to the lists. But there was only one drive to and from the castle, so that the knights had to jostle back and forth past and through each other. There had been no arrangement for parade control, and the knightly gridlock took hours longer to unfold than had been planned. By the time the parade was ready, it was a half mile long and over three hours late.|$|E

25|$|A short week two-game {{road trip}} {{concluded}} on a Friday in Chicago, where D.C. once again rescued {{a point in}} the final minutes. The game started brightly for the visitors, when they were awarded an indirect free kick just outside the Fire's 6-yard box. Rob Vincent scored his first MLS goal, with a blast through the defense, assisted by Acosta. However, the Fire responded quickly as Luke Mishu, playing for the injured Franklin, lost his mark on a corner kick and surrendered a header for goal. The Fire made it 2-0 not long thereafter, as David Accam dribbled around Birnbaum <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> shot that found the corner of the goal. Down a goal, United turned in a tired display, and seemed destined for a defeat. As the game went into stoppage time, Mullins took a chance with a spectacular overhead volley that rang off the crossbar. The rebound went to Nyarko, who forced a save by the diving Sean Johnson, but Boswell headed that rebound in for the tying goal. The draw again put United ahead of Orlando City Soccer Club {{in the race for the}} final playoff position, - but only on the goal differential tiebreaker with a big home match against Orlando City looming the following weekend. Both teams actually trailed New England Revolution in that race, by two points, but the Revolution had played an additional game.|$|E
500|$|... "City of Angels" [...] {{was written}} by lead vocalist Jared Leto, who also {{produced}} the song with Steve Lillywhite. The latter had previously worked with Thirty Seconds to Mars on {{the production of the}} band's third studio album, This Is War (2009). The song was engineered by Jamie Reed Schefman and mixed by Serban Ghenea. John Hanes engineered it for mixing at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. It was recorded at The International Centre for the Advancement of the Arts and Sciences of Sound in Los Angeles, California and mastered by Howie Weinberg and Dan Gerbarg at Howie Weinberg Mastering. Thirty Seconds to Mars unveiled six songs from their fourth studio album Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams, including [...] "City of Angels", during a preview held at the Electric Lady Studios in New York City on March 14, 2013. Shannon Leto revealed that it was the oldest song written for the album <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to make.|$|E
500|$|Parker and Stone {{were unhappy}} with the turkey attack subplot, which they felt [...] "never really went anywhere" [...] and ended {{abruptly}} without any satisfying conclusion. They nevertheless included it because they felt obligated to include a B story, since every episode in the season so far had included one. Later in the series, they said they realized this was not necessary and made many episodes without a B story. Although the duo liked the [...] "payoff" [...] of the Starvin' Marvin main plot, {{they did not know}} how to end the turkey subplot, so they simply had the characters kill all the turkeys and claim that there were none left; they decided this sudden ending was the funniest possible option. Stone said of the subplot, [...] "The turkeys were just an excuse to have the Braveheart sequence." [...] The animators enjoyed creating the turkey battle scene, which was designed to be shown in widescreen aspect ratio while the rest of the episode was animated normally. However, the animation proved to be very difficult <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to do because it involved a larger number of characters and animals in one scene than had ever been featured previously in the show. Some of the characters in the far background were animated as gray and shadowy, which Parker said was not so much a visual effect as it was a [...] "lighting effect meaning we didn't want to draw all these people".|$|E

2500|$|In 2001 Stefan Valdobrev {{decided to}} {{concentrate}} mainly on his acting career <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{break from the}} music scene. For almost a decade he very sporadically released a few singles that became instant hits but it was, as he stated, [...] "just to keep me in form". In 2006 he recorded the blue romantic song Fireworks, in 2009 the reggae-swing chart-topper The Riverbank Most Green, introducing the young future soul star Ruth Koleva.|$|E
2500|$|Brown was Resident Magistrate at Greenough until 1869, {{when he was}} {{appointed}} Government Resident and Resident Magistrate at Geraldton {{following the death of}} Alfred Durlacher. [...] The following year a number of magisterial positions were reshuffled, and Brown {{was appointed}} Resident Magistrate at Bunbury. [...] He was reluctant to take up the position, however, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> leave of absence. [...] He still had not taken up the position in October 1870 when he was appointed to a nominee position on the Western Australian Legislative Council.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950 English season, however, he ventured {{abroad for}} the first time, taking part in a Commonwealth tour of India and Sri Lanka and opening the batting in all five of the {{representative}} games. He had some success on the tour, scoring one century, {{the only one of the}} 50 centuries in his career not to be made for Somerset. Perhaps more typically, he was homesick and unhappy: [...] "At first I wondered whether I'd picked up a bug. But it was purely mental," [...] he said in a tape transcribed in his biography. Lighter by about 12kg, he struggled for runs more than usually in the 1951 season, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> break from cricket in July, returning to some form afterwards.|$|E

2500|$|In 1951, Lowell {{published}} The Mills of the Kavanaughs, which {{centered on}} its epic title poem {{and failed to}} receive the high praise that his previous book had received. Although it received a generally positive review in The New York Times, Randall Jarrell gave the book a mixed review. Although Jarrell liked the shorter poems, he thought the epic title poem didn't work, stating [...] ""The people [...] too often seem to be acting {{in the manner of}} Robert Lowell, rather than plausibly as real people act [...] [...] [...]I doubt that many readers will think them real." [...] Following The Mills of the Kavanaughs, Lowell hit a creative roadblock <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> break from publishing. However, {{by the end of the}} decade, he started writing again and changed stylistic direction with his next book of verse, Life Studies (1959), which won the National Book Award for poetry in 1960 and became the most influential book that Lowell would ever publish.(With acceptance speech by Lowell and essay by Dilruba Ahmed from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.) In his acceptance speech for the National Book Award, Lowell famously divided American poetry into two camps: the [...] "cooked" [...] and the [...] "raw." [...] This commentary by Lowell was made in reference to the popularity of Allen Ginsberg and the Beat Generation poets and was a signal from Lowell that he was trying to incorporate some of their [...] "raw" [...] energy into his own poetry.|$|E
