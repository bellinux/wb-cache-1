5|$|As time passes, Khouw {{sees his}} wife {{occasionally}} transform into a snake. She is always, however, <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> him otherwise. He falls further {{in love with}} her, and their marriage is a happy one. After several months he is accosted by a priest, Hoat Hae Sian Soe, who then leads an attempt to kill the snake-woman. She escapes, pursued by the priests.|$|E
5|$|Eddy {{returned}} to Massachusetts in August. While the Second Continental Congress and George Washington would not authorize, fund, or otherwise support military activities in Nova Scotia, Eddy was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the Massachusetts Provincial Congress {{to provide some}} material support (primarily muskets, ammunition, powder, and other military supplies) for an attempt on Fort Cumberland. It also allowed Eddy to engage in recruiting in the District of Maine.|$|E
5|$|Friday, however, {{saw more}} panic on the exchange. Morgan again {{approached}} the bank presidents, {{but this time}} was only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> them to pledge $9.7 million. In order for this money to keep the exchange open, Morgan decided the money {{could not be used}} for margin sales. The volume of trading on Friday was 2/3 that of Thursday. The markets again narrowly made it to the closing bell.|$|E

60|$|It did {{not require}} any lengthy or <b>able</b> {{argument}} <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Joe {{that he would be}} warranted in ceasing his work as machinist to become a treasure-seeker, for he was fully as eager as Bob to test the truth of the apparent statement contained in the document.|$|R
50|$|Both Gaudin and Barrelet {{objected to}} this and refused to {{participate}} further if Ashe was allowed {{to advance to the}} finals. Both men were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be <b>convinced</b> <b>to</b> race against Ashe. Barrelet and Gaudin easily beat Ashe; Barrelet won the gold medal and Gaudin the silver, while Ashe placed third to receive a bronze medal.|$|R
5|$|Seeking a {{union with}} the United States was not a {{referendum}} option, despite the idea having some currency amongst locals. With the Cold War looming, U.S. interest in Newfoundland were centered primarily on its strategic importance to the defence of North America. The Americans' ability to maintain bases on the island satisfied those concerns - after receiving assurances that the Canadian government would honour the leases for bases on Newfoundland, the U.S. State department had no further interest in the political future of Newfoundland. President Harry S. Truman's administration had little incentive to pursue annexation. With respect to foreign policy, such a territorial ambition would have only served to antagonize two key allies. With respect to domestic policy, the administration would not likely have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Congress to offer statehood to Newfoundland due to its small population and geographical isolation from the then-48 existing states, and would not likely have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Newfoundlanders to accept territorial status {{as an alternative to}} admission as a U.S. state.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{provides}} a dubious account of Darius's ascension: Several days after Gaumata had been assassinated, Darius {{and the other}} six nobles discussed {{the fate of the}} empire. At first, the seven discussed the form of government; a democratic republic was strongly pushed by Otanes, an oligarchy was pushed by Megabyzus, while Darius pushed for a monarchy. After stating that a republic would lead to corruption and internal fighting, while a monarchy would be led with a single-mindedness not possible in other governments, Darius was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the other nobles.|$|E
5|$|In November of that year, Prost had {{a meeting}} with the head of Honda's R {{department}} and F1 racing program, Nobuhiko Kawamoto in Geneva. He expressed his feelings that Honda was giving Senna preferential treatment, and Kawamoto then confirmed Prost's fears, explaining that the Honda engineers were of a new generation, and that they liked Senna's panache and samurai-like driving. Kawamoto was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Prost that he would work something out on the Honda end of the McLaren-Honda partnership for the 1989 season, but this was not to be.|$|E
60|$|I must indeed confess, that an {{endowment}} of {{this nature}} would prove a very large and perpetual expense. However, I have not the least diffidence, that I shall be <b>able</b> effectually <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the world that my present scheme for such an hospital is very practicable, and must be very desirable by every one who hath the interest of his country, or his fellow-creatures, really at heart.|$|R
30|$|Explicitly {{assessing}} {{the climate of}} readiness for change frees a project from being dependent on serendipity and luck. Before embarking on a project, one should consider of the capacity of people and systems to change, or at least <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be <b>convinced</b> that change is worthwhile. Assessment of the climate’s readiness for change begins with understanding the culture and organizational structures at the sites where change is anticipated (Gannaway et al. 2013).|$|R
50|$|Kelly {{falls in}} love with J.L. Grant (Michael Dante), the wealthy scion of the town's {{founding}} family, an urbane sophisticate, and Griff's best friend. After a dream-like courtship where even Kelly's admission of her past can't deter Grant, the two decide to marry. It is only after Kelly is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> finally <b>convince</b> Griff that she truly loves Grant and has given up prostitution for good that he agrees to be their best man.|$|R
5|$|Philip II was {{twenty-four years}} old when he acceded to the throne in 359BC. Through the use of deft diplomacy, he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the Thracians under Berisades to cease their support of Pausanias, a pretender to the throne, and the Athenians to halt their support of another pretender. He {{achieved}} these by bribing the Thracians and their Paeonian allies and establishing a treaty with Athens that relinquished his claims to Amphipolis. He was also able to make peace with the Illyrians who had threatened his borders.|$|E
5|$|Samuel {{eventually}} {{turns up}} drunk {{at a local}} bar, his faith shaken by the death. He is taken into custody. The agents doubt his ability, but he is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Mulder that he knows the latter has lost a sister—Samantha—at a young age. Mulder has been seeing visions of Samantha, and continues to see them. At Samuel's bail hearing, the courtroom fills with a swarm of locusts, which Samuel claims {{is a sign of}} God's wrath against him.|$|E
5|$|Set {{during a}} fictional version of Japan in the pre-Meiji period, Sanosuke {{is a former}} member of the Sekihō Army. When the group is {{destroyed}} by the Meiji Government, he becomes a fighter-for-hire to calm his anger by fighting. During his introduction in the series, he encounters the wanderer Himura Kenshin, who easily defeats him and is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> him to stop his mercenary work and instead start protecting people. After that encounter, Sanosuke becomes Kenshin's best friend as well as his partner in most of their fights.|$|E
50|$|Over the years, Ray Stevens {{has been}} viewed by many wrestling {{insiders}} as the best worker during the 1960s. Stevens {{had the ability to}} make any opponent look good, no matter how badly they may perform in the ring. In addition, he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> demonstrably <b>convince</b> the fans, through his ring work and his equally great interview work, that he could methodically and completely destroy anyone regardless of how strong or how big they may be.|$|R
5000|$|The {{work was}} {{presented}} to, and debated by, the First Continental Congress. When this took place, Jefferson did not attend. Despite his attempts, Congress {{agreed to a}} more moderate decision than Jefferson's proposed concept. Despite not being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> completely <b>convince</b> Congress, friends of Jefferson printed the Summary in a pamphlet form. It was distributed throughout London, New York and Philadelphia. Research states that the document [...] "helped establish Jefferson's reputation as a skillful, if radical, political writer." ...|$|R
25|$|Reconstruction of {{the temple}} under Herod began with a massive {{expansion}} of the Temple Mount. Religious worship and temple rituals continued during the construction process. When the Roman emperor Caligula planned to place his own statue inside the temple, Herod's grandson Agrippa I was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> intervene and <b>convince</b> him against this.|$|R
5|$|The Shelleys {{moved to}} Windsor {{in the summer}} of 1815. Hogg visited them there when his {{workload}} permitted. They left England for Continental Europe again in May 1816, and Hogg resumed his visits after their return, but he was no longer as close to them as he had been. This was in part due to his awkwardness with Mary, who was preoccupied with her efforts to finish writing Frankenstein. Percy and Hogg were nonetheless <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Mary to attend the opera with them on a few occasions.|$|E
5|$|The Stamp Act was {{scheduled}} {{to go into effect}} on November 1, 1765, but it was not enforced because protestors throughout the colonies had compelled stamp distributors to resign. Eventually, British merchants were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Parliament to repeal the tax. By May 16, 1766, news of the repeal had reached Boston. There was celebration throughout the city, and Adams made a public statement of thanks to British merchants for helping their cause.|$|E
5|$|The group {{agrees that}} Randall is an {{imminent}} threat, and Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) believes {{he should be}} executed but waits until sunset. Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) finds most of the group agree with Rick's decision, and attempts {{to change their minds}} by appealing to their humanity, civilization and morality. Most agree with Rick's choice for various reasons, but Shane (Jon Bernthal) agrees to support Dale should he be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the others to change their minds.|$|E
5000|$|This first {{grant was}} for 50 acres at Broken Bay. Broken Bay is the {{entrance}} of the Hawkesbury River into the sea. It appears that Milson never did farm this land and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> instead <b>convince</b> the Governor Macquarie to change this to a larger land grant of 100 acres at Pennant Hills in the [...] "Field of Mars" [...] (see below). Milson was successfully farming before 24 August 1819 when he was paid £7 14s remuneration from Police Fund for damages done him by Government cattle.|$|R
50|$|Aronberg {{has focused}} {{much of his}} career on {{fighting}} opiate abuse, beginning in 2001 when he was among the first in the country to investigate Purdue Pharma.  After the Florida Attorney General’s Office settled with Purdue Pharma, Aronberg helped to lead a decade-long effort to establish the State’s Prescription Drug Monitoring Program to stop doctor shopping and close “pill mills” that were overprescribing opiates such as oxycodone.  In his final year in the Senate, Aronberg was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> help <b>convince</b> the legislature <b>to</b> enact much-needed oversight of the pain clinic industry to stem the unregulated, unlimited distribution of opiates throughout the State.|$|R

Susanne threatens to reveal secrets about D.C.'s top politicians on her new book; while the team was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> eventually <b>convince</b> her not <b>to</b> do so, Huck suddenly kills her. Marcus Walker is accused of murdering the Mayor's wife, with whom he was having affair. The team eventually discovers that Mayor was in fact responsible for the murder, framing Marcus for it. The team <b>convinces</b> the Mayor <b>to</b> step down from his position, but Marcus decides to reveal the truth to the media.|$|R
5|$|As {{early as}} in February 1913, poet and lawyer Luis Lloréns Torres had {{publicly}} requested that Betances' wishes {{to have his}} ashes returned to Puerto Rico be fulfilled. The Nationalist Association (predecessor of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party), under the presidency of José Coll y Cuchí, was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the Puerto Rican Legislative Assembly to approve an act {{that would allow the}} transfer of the mortal remains of Puerto Rican patriot Ramón Emeterio Betances from Paris, France to Puerto Rico. Seven years after the act's approval, the Legislative Assembly commissioned one of its delegates, Alfonso Lastra Charriez, to serve as an emissary and bring Betances' remains from France.|$|E
5|$|Between 1941 and 1946, Harrison was the ship's {{doctor on}} board the Demodocus, a steam liner {{ferrying}} supplies to Allied forces across the Indian Ocean. After the war, Harrison wanted to assist the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), but had to falsify his records by subtracting seven years off his age to qualify for service. During this time, he served in China delivering much-needed supplies to a country devastated by the long Second Sino-Japanese War and once even saved the lives of 90students by sheltering them from a Kuomintang officer. By donning an American army officer's uniform, Harrison was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the Kuomintang officer to not check a barge which held the students hidden inside.|$|E
5|$|Disappointed by {{the failure}} to sink {{merchant}} ships in that battle, Adolf Hitler ordered {{the majority of the}} surface warships scrapped, though Admiral Karl Dönitz was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Hitler to retain the surface fleet. As a result, Admiral Hipper was returned to Germany and decommissioned for repairs. The ship was never restored to operational status, however, and on 3 May 1945, Royal Air Force bombers severely damaged her while she was in Kiel. Her crew scuttled the ship at her moorings, and in July 1945, she was raised and towed to Heikendorfer Bay. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1948–1952 and her bell is currently on display at the Laboe Naval Memorial.|$|E
5000|$|Rick {{became the}} second Hourman when the Crisis on Infinite Earths {{threatened}} all of reality, {{and he used}} one of his dad's Miraclo pills {{to save the life}} of Beth Chapel, whom he grew quite fond of. His father strongly disapproved of Rick's actions, knowing the addictive effects of Miraclo and tried to prevent Rick from taking up the Hourman mantle. Nonetheless, Rick ended up trying to join a team of other 2nd generation heroes known as Infinity, Inc. Rex was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> temporarily <b>convince</b> his son not to, although Rick continued to try to persuade him.|$|R

As soon as they arrive at Algonquin Park, Golden regrets his decision immediately, having come completely unprepared. Meanwhile, Miss Scrimmage also drives the girls to Algonquin Park, thinking that she is actually driving to Montreal. Eventually Miss Scrimmage notices {{that something is wrong}} with the road, but the girls are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> successfully <b>convince</b> her <b>to</b> go on the camping trip.

He is <b>able,</b> eventually, <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Karai of the truth about their past, but she subsequently mutates into a snake-like being when Shredder's plan for revenge backfires. Later, Earth is invaded by the Kraang and, in the ensuing battle, much of Splinter's lair is destroyed before Splinter is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> defeat Kraang Sub-Prime.

5|$|From Campobello, Eddy sailed up the Saint John River to Maugerville, where 27 {{men were}} recruited, {{and then up}} to the Maliseet {{settlement}} at Aukpaque (just upriver from present-day Fredericton). There he learned the bad news that Pierre Tomah, the main Maliseet chief, {{was not interested in}} taking up the hatchet. Eddy was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Ambroise St. Aubin, one of Tomah's competitors, and 15 men to join the expedition in exchange for an agreement with the Maugerville community to support the families of those men. In another disappointment, none of the local Acadians joined, contrary to assertions St. Aubin had made to Eddy during a previous visit to the area.|$|E
5|$|Howard Stark (portrayed by Dominic Cooper) is {{a weapons}} {{developer}} who is framed for selling weapons to America's enemies. One {{of the weapons}} he created during the war was Midnight Oil, designed to give soldiers extra stamina during war, but instead it caused psychosis and led to them killing each other. The U.S. military stole Midnight Oil and used it on the Russians, and Fennhoff blames Stark for the ensuing massacre. Fennhoff hypnotises Stark into bombing New York, but Carter is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Stark to stop. He moves on to set up his own film studio in Los Angeles.|$|E

She was <b>able</b> later, however, <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> him <b>to</b> allow her to return to Paris in order to give birth to her daughter, Louise Henriette. Her husband died a year later.|$|R
50|$|A behrupiya or bahrupiya (Hindustani: बहरूपिया or بہروپیا) is an impressionist in the {{traditional}} performing arts of India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. Once popular and widespread, the art form is now in decline with most practitioners living in poverty. It was once common for behrupiyas to make a dramatic entrance at wedding or other festivities dressed as a policeman, priest, or other figure and create a commotion. The social norm surrounding these appearances was that the behrupiya usually collected no money if he was detected as an impersonator. However, if he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> successfully <b>convince</b> his audience of his fake identity, he would then reveal it and be awarded a baksheesh for having entertained the group.|$|R
