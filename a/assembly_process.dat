5|$|Only recently, the <b>assembly</b> <b>process</b> of the 19S {{regulatory}} particle {{has been}} elucidated to considerable extent. The 19S regulatory particle assembles as two distinct subcomponents, {{the base and}} the lid. Assembly of the base complex is facilitated by four assembly chaperones, Hsm3/S5b, Nas2/p27, Rpn14/PAAF1, and Nas6/gankyrin (names for yeast/mammals). These assembly chaperones bind to the AAA-ATPase subunits and their main function {{seems to be to}} ensure proper assembly of the heterohexameric AAA-ATPase ring. To date it is still under debate whether the base complex assembles separately, whether the assembly is templated by the 20S core particle, or whether alternative assembly pathways exist. In addition to the four assembly chaperones, the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6/Usp14 also promotes base assembly, but it is not essential. The lid assembles separately in a specific order and does not require assembly chaperones.|$|E

40|$|Ecological theory {{suggests}} that spatial distribution of biodiversity is strongly driven by community <b>assembly</b> <b>processes.</b> Thus the study of diversity patterns combined with null model testing has become increasingly common to infer <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> from observed distributions of diversity indices. However, results in both empirical and simulation studies are inconsistent. The aim of our study is to determine with simulated data which facets of biodiversity, if any, may unravel the processes driving its spatial patterns, and to provide practical considerations about the combination of diversity indices that would produce significant and congruent signals when using null models. The study is based on simulated species' assemblages that emerge under various landscape structures in a spatially explicit individual-based model with contrasting, predefined <b>assembly</b> <b>processes.</b> We focus on four <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> (species-sorting, mass effect, neutral dynamics and competition colonization trade-off) and investigate the emerging species' distributions with varied diversity indices (alpha, beta and gamma) measured at different spatial scales and for different diversity facets (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic). We find that 1) the four <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> result in distinct spatial distributions of species under any landscape structure, 2) {{a broad range of}} diversity indices allows distinguishing between communities driven by different <b>assembly</b> <b>processes,</b> 3) null models provide congruent results only for a small fraction of diversity indices and 4) only a combination of these diversity indices allows identifying the correct <b>assembly</b> <b>processes.</b> Our study supports the inference of <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> from patterns of diversity only when different types of indices are combined. It highlights the need to combine phylogenetic, functional and taxonomic diversity indices at multiple spatial scales to effectively infer underlying <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> from diversity patterns by illustrating how combination of different indices might help disentangling the complex question of coexistence...|$|R
40|$|Lean {{production}} has {{over the last}} decades emerged {{as the most important}} paradigm for production, with the <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> in focus, including the objective to minimize non-value-adding work. Thus, much attention has been on the work of the assembly operator. However, little focus has been devoted to how the new requirements from lean production have been transformed into materials supply systems supporting the <b>assembly</b> <b>processes.</b> Hence, the purpose of this thesis is to contribute to increased knowledge about the relation between <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> and materials supply systems design. A framework is introduced in this thesis, describing how requirements from the <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> are transformed by the materials supply system into the actual materials flow. In the results of this thesis, a model structuring requirements in materials supply and <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> is proposed, tested, and subsequently different requirements were identified. Materials exposure is introduced as the transition from the materials supply system to the assembly system. Results show that that the materials exposure has a large impact on assembly workstations performance in terms of space needed, non-value-adding work and ergonomics. Further, an experiment showed that the materials exposure factors with the largest impact on picking time were packaging, angle of packaging and height above floor. Major contributions in this thesis are the identification and structuring of requirements in <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> and materials supply systems, and explaining how the materials exposure affects the <b>assembly</b> <b>processes.</b> How this knowledge can be applied in the design of new, or redesign of existing, production systems and materials supply processes in particular, is a managerial contribution...|$|R

25|$|Assembly {{language}} uses a mnemonic {{to represent}} each low-level machine instruction or opcode, typically also each architectural register, flag, etc. Many operations require {{one or more}} operands in order to form a complete instruction and most assemblers can take expressions of numbers and named constants as well as registers and labels as operands, freeing the programmer from tedious repetitive calculations. Depending on the architecture, these elements may also be combined for specific instructions or addressing modes using offsets or other data as well as fixed addresses. Many assemblers offer additional mechanisms to facilitate program development, to control the <b>assembly</b> <b>process,</b> and to aid debugging.|$|E
25|$|New MPyV virions are {{assembled}} in the nucleus in dense local aggregations known as virus factories. Capsid proteins, produced in the cytoplasm of the host cell, enter the nucleus as assembled capsomers consisting of pentameric VP1 associated with VP2 or VP3.

Once inside the nucleus they assemble into mature capsids containing a copy of the viral genome, although the exact mechanism of encapsidation is not well understood. Filamentous or tubular structures representing polymerized VP1 have been observed in the nuclei of infected cells as intermediates in the <b>assembly</b> <b>process</b> from which mature virions are produced.|$|E

40|$|AIM : We used a {{hierarchical}} fractal-based sampling design to test how sampling scale influences i) beta diversity and ii) inferences on the modelled contribution of niche- versus dispersal-based <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> in structuring tree and bird assemblages. Location Coastal forest fragments, South Africa METHODS : We surveyed 103 tree and 267 bird points within eight forest fragments and partitioned beta diversity (βsor) into its turnover (βsim) and nestedness (βnes) components. We evaluated how sampling at fine, intermediate and coarse scales influenced beta diversity components and compared how tree and bird beta diversity respond to sampling grain variation. We then explored the relative contributions of niche- and dispersal based <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> in explaining spatial turnover {{as a function}} of sampling grain and/or study taxon by using multiple regression modelling on distance matrices and variance partitioning. RESULTS : Beta diversity (βsor) of trees and birds was mainly explained by spatial turnover (βsim) at all sampling scales. For both taxonomic groups, βsor and βsim decreased as sampling scale increased. Beta diversity differed among trees and birds at fine, but not at coarse sampling scales. Dispersalbased <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> were the best predictors of community assembly at fine scales, whereas niche-based <b>assembly</b> <b>processes</b> were the best predictors at coarse scales. Most of the variation in tree community composition was, however, explained at fine scales (by dispersal-based <b>assembly</b> <b>processes),</b> while most of the variation in bird community composition was explained at coarse scales (by niche-based <b>assembly</b> <b>processes).</b> MAIN CONCLUSIONS : Our study shows that inferences from beta diversity are scale dependent. By matching the grain of the data with the grain at which predictor variables and associated processes are likely to operate, multi-scale sampling approaches can improve biodiversity conservation and should be part of incentives directed at ecological sensible conservation plans.

25|$|The natural {{progression}} was {{to streamline}} the <b>assembly</b> <b>process</b> and the company introduced a method known as Progressive Construction. In this process the mass-produced parts were combined into “unit assemblies”, each {{of which was a}} major sub-component of the finished carriage such as side panels, carriage ends or the roof. The workshops were organised on the “flow-line” principle, similar to a modern assembly line, and the unit assemblies were taken to workstations, where the precision machining of the mass-produced parts ensured they all fitted accurately into position, building into a complete carriage as the unit moved along the flow line. The technique was already in use in Derby prior to grouping, and was adopted in Wolverton during 1925, with Newton Heath following two years later. By using this method, the time taken to construct a typical carriage fell from six weeks to six days and by 1931 Derby and Wolverton were able to handle the entire LMS carriage building workload, and production at Newton Heath ceased.|$|E
