5|$|On 4 January 1970 Moon {{accident}}ally {{killed his}} friend, driver and bodyguard, Neil Boland, outside the Red Lion pub in Hatfield, Hertfordshire. Pub patrons {{had begun to}} attack his Bentley <b>and</b> <b>Moon,</b> drunk, began driving to escape them. During the fracas, he hit Boland. After an investigation, the coroner ruled Boland's death an accident <b>and</b> <b>Moon</b> received an absolute discharge after being charged {{with a number of}} offences.|$|E
5|$|The theory posited by Zhang and Jing was {{supported}} by later pre-modern scientists such as Shen Kuo (1031–1095), who expanded on the reasoning of why the Sun <b>and</b> <b>Moon</b> were spherical.|$|E

5|$|A third {{possibility}} {{is where the}} primary <b>and</b> <b>moon</b> are tidally locked to each other. In that case, the tidal bulge stays directly under the moon, there is no transfer of angular momentum, and the orbital period will not change. Pluto and Charon are {{an example of this}} type of configuration.|$|E
5|$|After reuniting {{with the}} other Pythons in the film The Meaning of Life (1983), Chapman began a lengthy series of U.S. college tours, talking about the Pythons, the Dangerous Sports Club <b>and</b> <b>Moon,</b> among other subjects. Saturday Night Live creator and Python fan Lorne Michaels persuaded Chapman to star in The New Show.|$|E
5|$|An annular eclipse {{occurs when}} the Sun <b>and</b> <b>Moon</b> are exactly {{in line with the}} Earth, but the {{apparent}} size of the Moon is smaller than that of the Sun. Hence the Sun appears as a very bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.|$|E

5|$|Earth's axis of {{rotation}} is tilted, producing seasonal variations on the planet's surface. The gravitational interaction between the Earth <b>and</b> <b>Moon</b> causes ocean tides, stabilizes the Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and {{the largest of the}} four terrestrial planets.|$|E
5|$|Improvements {{were made}} to the {{original}} planetarium projector over the years, allowing for special effects that could show close-up displays of specific planets, and the Sun <b>and</b> <b>Moon</b> projectors could replicate the experience of a solar or lunar eclipse.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these two gameplay types, Sonic Unleashed also features hubworlds, in which the player may reveal, as well as advance, {{the story of the}} game. Hubworlds operate differently depending on the version of the game being played; the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions feature fully interactive, explorable 3D hubworlds, similar to those in Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic Adventure, in which townspeople may be interacted with and side quests may be undertaken, in order to gain experience or unlock items, such as artwork, videos and music tracks. In contrast, the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions feature menu-based map systems, in which players simply click on areas to talk to townspeople and find information. Within both day and nighttime levels are medals that Sonic may collect, two types of which exist: Sun <b>and</b> <b>Moon.</b> In the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, collecting these medals allows the player to level up Sonic's Sun <b>and</b> <b>Moon</b> stats, and these must be increased to reach new stages in the game, with a certain number of Sun medals for Hedgehog levels, and a certain number of Moon medals for Werehog levels. Because only the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions feature playable hubworlds, these are also the only versions in which Sun <b>and</b> <b>Moon</b> medals may be found by exploring the towns, talking to the citizens, and completing side quests. In the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions, Sun <b>and</b> <b>Moon</b> medals are earned after completing stages and clearing their objectives. The medals are used to open up doors in Gaia gates, which can earn bonus content.|$|E

5|$|The clock has its {{original}} medieval face. As well as showing {{the time on}} a 24-hour dial, it reflects {{the motion of the}} Sun <b>and</b> <b>Moon,</b> the phases of the Moon, and the time since the last new Moon. The astronomical dial represents a geocentric or pre-Copernican view of the universe, with the Sun <b>and</b> <b>Moon</b> revolving round a central fixed Earth, like that of the clock at Ottery St Mary. The quarters are chimed by a quarter jack {{in the form of a}} small automaton known as Jack Blandifers, who hits two bells with hammers and two with his heels. At the striking of the clock, jousting knights appear above the clock face.|$|E

The Moldavian shield {{is held by}} two crowned figures.|$|E

A model that only includes the Earth, the <b>Moon</b> <b>and</b> the Sun {{is called a}} tellurion or tellurium, and one which only includes the Earth <b>and</b> the <b>Moon</b> is a lunarium.

5|$|According to the {{earliest}} account, the first Elves are awakened by Eru Ilúvatar near {{the bay of}} Cuiviénen during the Years of the Trees in the First Age.

The first Elves to awake are three pairs: Imin ("First") and his wife Iminyë, Tata ("Second") and Tatië, and Enel ("Third") and Enelyë.|$|E
5|$|After fusing helium in {{its core}} to carbon, the Sun {{will begin to}} {{collapse}} again, evolving into a compact white dwarf star after ejecting its outer atmosphere as a planetary nebula. In 50 billion years, if the Earth <b>and</b> <b>Moon</b> are not engulfed by the Sun, they will become tidelocked, with each showing only one face to the other. Thereafter, the tidal action of the Sun will extract angular momentum from the system, causing the lunar orbit to decay and the Earth's spin to accelerate.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is {{inclined}} only about 5.145° to the ecliptic and the Sun is always very near the ecliptic, eclipses always occur on or near it. Because of the inclination of the Moon's orbit, eclipses do not occur at every conjunction and opposition of the Sun <b>and</b> <b>Moon,</b> but only when the Moon is near an ascending or descending node {{at the same time}} it is at conjunction or opposition. The ecliptic is so named because the ancients noted that eclipses only occurred when the Moon crossed it.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus clouds, like {{cirrostratus}} clouds, {{can produce}} several optical effects, such as halos {{around the sun}} <b>and</b> <b>moon.</b> Halos are caused by interaction of the light with hexagonal ice crystals present in the clouds, which, depending on their shape and orientation, {{can result in a}} wide variety of white and colored rings, arcs and spots in the sky. Common halo varieties are the 22° halo, sun dogs, the circumzenithal arc and the circumhorizontal arc (also known as fire rainbows). Halos produced by cirrus clouds tend to be more pronounced and colorful than those caused by cirrostratus.|$|E
5|$|In Mesopotamian iconography, the {{crescent}} {{was the primary}} symbol of Nanna-Sîn. The Moon goddess Selene was represented as wearing a crescent on her headgear in an arrangement reminiscent of horns. The star and crescent arrangement also {{goes back to the}} Bronze Age, representing either the Sun <b>and</b> <b>Moon,</b> or the Moon and planet Venus, in combination. It came to represent the goddess Artemis or Hecate, and via the patronage of Hecate came {{to be used as a}} symbol of Byzantium.|$|E
