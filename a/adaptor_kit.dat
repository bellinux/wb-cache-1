50|$|Space Ace {{was made}} {{available}} to distributors in two different formats; a dedicated cabinet, and a conversion kit {{that could be used}} to turn an existing copy of Dragon's Lair into a Space Ace game. Early version #1 production units of the dedicated Space game were actually issued in Dragon's Lair style cabinets. The latter version #2 dedicated Space Ace units came in a different, inverted style cabinet. The conversion kit included the Space Ace laserdisc, new EPROMs containing the game program, an additional circuit board to add the skill level buttons, and replacement artwork for the cabinet. The game originally used the Pioneer LD-V1000 or PR-7820 laserdisc players, but an <b>adaptor</b> <b>kit</b> now exists to allow Sony LDP series players to be used as replacements if the original player is no longer functional.|$|E
5000|$|A variant and {{effectively}} the successor of the Scout is the Steyr Elite (previously {{known as the}} Steyr Tactical Elite), a more robustly constructed model {{with many of the}} same features of the Scout, but designed primarily for the law enforcement market for an urban tactical role. Differences to the standard Scout include an extended STANAG type mounting rail, an enlarged bolt knob of the SSG type, an adjustable cheek piece, and a height-adjustable buttpad. It is fitted with a heavy 570 mm barrel, and can produce high muzzle velocities due to a [...] "fast" [...] internal profile. The additional features of the Elite give it a weight of over 4.2 kg, which makes it fall outside the definition of a scout rifle. Although intended for intermediate ranges, with match grade 7.62 mm (.308 inch) ammunition and 10.0 g (155 grain) projectiles entirely acceptable performance at up to 800 m has been recorded making it a good all-rounder. It is standard with a synthetic 5-round magazine, but an external <b>adaptor</b> <b>kit</b> can be attached to fit a 10-round magazine (not available on 5.56 NATO). It is normally available in two calibers; 5.56 NATO and 7.62 NATO, but can be specially ordered in 7 mm-08 Remington upon request.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroductionBefore IS- 1 (3. 2 mm) {{standardization}} of pacemaker leads and connectors, 5 / 6 mm connector ports accomodated 5 mm or 6 mm diameter lead connector pins. Case reportA patient with sick sinus syndrome underwent implantation of a 5 mm unipolar atrial lead, mated to a 5 / 6 mm connector port Medtronic Spectrax Sx 5985 pacemaker. Pulse generator reached ERI in 2006, with change {{out to a}} Medtronic Sigma SSR 306 (5 / 6 mm connector port) and preservation of the 5 mm lead. She was admitted in 2010 for atrial lead non capture from blood leak and corrosion of the header-connector pin apparatus. Discussion 5 / 6 mm pacemaker header ports have a 5 mm flexible sealing ring at the port entrance to seal 5 mm or 6 mm lead connector pins. The inner barrel diameter of the connector port is 6 mm and insertion of a 5 mm lead results in a 0. 5 mm tolerance circumferentially. Should the seal be compromised, blood can corrode the apparatus. To minimize this, we can employ (a) a cinching tie to further seal the silicone ring (b) universal adaptor sleeves (c) splice <b>kits</b> (d) lead <b>adaptor</b> <b>kits.</b> Aging leads, <b>adaptor</b> <b>kits</b> or sleeves themselves can result in lead failure. It may be safer to re-implant the entire system. ConclusionA 5 / 6 mm configuration pacemaker header connector port allows for significant tolerances when a 5 mm lead is used. Consideration {{must be made to}} prevent leaks...|$|R
50|$|British Leyland's Special Tuning {{department}} (which primarily handled {{development of}} BL's 'works' motorsport cars and technical support to private entries using BL products) produced {{a variety of}} upgrades for the Marina, which were (technically) available on road cars through special order. Amongst the S/T products were a kit to adapt the front suspension to use telescopic dampers (eventually fitted to the 'Marina' in its last days as the Morris Ital and <b>adaptor</b> <b>kits</b> to convert the rear dampers to a more effective vertical orientation using separate turrets. The S/T suspension upgrades produced significant improvements in handling and ride over the standard Marina but were not widely publicised on the general market, remaining the preserve of specialist motorsport interests.|$|R
5000|$|The L85 is {{supplied}} with a sling, blank-firing <b>adaptor,</b> cleaning <b>kit</b> and a blade-type bayonet, which {{coupled with the}} sheath can double as a wire cutter (the sheath contains a small saw and sharpening stone). The rifle {{can be adapted to}} use [...]22 Long Rifle training ammunition with a special conversion kit. The Small Arms Weapons Effects Simulator can be used on the L85 when in training with blank ammunition. The rifle variant also accommodates a 40 mm under-barrel grenade launcher such as Heckler & Koch AG-36 40 mm grenade launcher variants.|$|R
