A {{model of}} the lectin from Aloe Arborescens was built by {{homology}} modelling. <b>Docking</b> <b>studies</b> with mannose were performed on this model and the known crystal structures of monocot mannose binding lectins from snowdrop and garlic. On {{the basis of these}} results association of monomers to form dimers is found to be necessary for successful binding of mannose by site III of these lectins, by providing the fourth strand of the β-sheet that is a supporting edge for the site. From an analysis of the carbohydrate binding sites (I, II and III) of the above lectins and the <b>docking</b> <b>studies,</b> the mannose binding site I of aloe lectin is predicted to retain the ability to bind mannose with all of the key residues involved in binding unchanged.
