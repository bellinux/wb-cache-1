5|$|Pang {{was asked}} to help Lennon and Ono with their avant-garde film projects, Up Your Legs Forever and Fly, in December 1970. Pang was then asked to be Lennon and Ono's {{secretary}} and factotum/gofer in New York and England, which led to <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>position</b> as their personal assistant when the Lennons moved from London to New York in 1971. Pang coordinated an art exhibition in Syracuse, New York, on October 9, 1971, for Ono's This Is Not Here art show at the Everson Museum. Ono's show coincided with Lennon's 31st birthday, and a party {{was held at the}} Hotel Syracuse, which was attended by Ringo Starr, Phil Spector, and Elliot Mintz, among others.|$|E

Dale offered Burnet <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>position</b> but he declined {{and returned to the}} Hall Institute. Following his productive work in London, the Rockefeller Institute agreed to fund a new virus research laboratory in Melbourne for Burnet.

5|$|Beckingham at {{the time}} he was {{mentioned}} in 1258 was working, probably as chief clerk, for Gilbert of Preston, the English crown's senior royal justice. This was an itinerant position, travelling in a circuit (or eyre); Gilbert's last eyre–and therefore also Beckingham's as his chief clerk–was that of 1268–72. In 1274, Beckingham himself was named an itinerant justice for Middlesex, although as yet this was not <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>position</b> and he was replaced by the next year. At this time he seems to have held the rank of king's serjeant. He received the commission of justice of assize in 1276. From 1273 to 1278, he was a senior clerk to the Court of Common Pleas, and was then made keeper of the writs and rolls of the court (custos rotulorum et brevium de banco) until 1285. In that year, Beckingham was appointed a Justice of the Common Pleas.|$|E
5|$|Born's {{position}} at Cambridge {{was only a}} temporary one, and his tenure at Göttingen was terminated in May 1935. He therefore accepted an offer from C. V. Raman to go to Bangalore in 1935. Born considered taking <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>position</b> there, but the Indian Institute of Science did not create an additional chair for him. In November 1935, the Born family had their German citizenship revoked, rendering them stateless. A few weeks later Göttingen cancelled Born's doctorate. Born considered an offer from Pyotr Kapitsa in Moscow, and started taking Russian lessons from Rudolf Peierls's Russian-born wife Genia. But then Charles Galton Darwin asked Born if he would consider becoming his successor as Tait Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, an offer that Born promptly accepted, assuming the chair in October 1936.|$|E
5|$|Barbirolli's first {{concert in}} New York was on 5 November 1936. The {{programme}} consisted of short pieces by Berlioz and Arnold Bax, and symphonies by Mozart (the Linz) and Brahms (the Fourth). During his ten weeks, he programmed several American novelties including Charles Martin Loeffler's tone-poem Memories of My Childhood, a symphony by Anis Fuleihan, and Philip James's Bret Harte overture. He also conducted Serge Koussevitzky's Double Bass Concerto. The players told the Philharmonic management {{that they would}} be happy for Barbirolli to be appointed to <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>position.</b> The outcome of this was an invitation to him to become Music Director and Permanent Conductor for three years starting with the 1937–38 season. At the same time as this great change in his professional life, Barbirolli's personal life was also transformed. His marriage had not lasted; within four years he and Marjorie Barbirolli had been living apart. In 1938 she sued for divorce on the grounds of his desertion. The suit was undefended, and the divorce was granted in December 1938. In 1939, Barbirolli married the British oboist Evelyn Rothwell. The marriage lasted for the rest of Barbirolli's life.|$|E

5|$|He {{gained a}} Second Class {{in the first}} History Tripos in 1909, and won the English Essay Prize with an essay on {{political}} satire in English poetry. He won the same prize again in 1910, and that year gained first-class honours in his Theological Special Examination. By this point, he was having doubts about his future as a minister and consulted with the university Law Reader as {{to the possibility of}} a career as a barrister. On the Reader's advice, Birkett took the second Law Tripos in 1911, passing with second-class honours. Birkett interviewed with the editors of The Guardian and The Observer in his search for a job to sustain him while he took the bar exam. He took a job as personal secretary to George Cadbury Junior, with a wage of £200 a year, which he planned to hold until he qualified as a barrister. After only a month of working for Cadbury, his salary was raised to £500, and he was offered <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>position.</b> While there, he continued his political work and spoke on behalf of the Liberal Party, cementing his reputation as an effective speaker by, on one occasion, holding the attention of more than a thousand people for an hour. He took {{the first part of the}} Bar Examination in 1912, but failed the paper on real property; he passed it on his second attempt, and was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple on 4 June 1913.|$|E
5|$|Much of Suffolk's early {{activity}} in East Anglian local politics was probably at the instigation of his mother, Alice, {{and he would}} later spend as much {{of his adult life}} at her manor of Ewelme as he did at his own manors. Suffolk played a prominent role in Commissions of the Peace in Norfolk and Suffolk, and these became <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>position</b> from 1464. On at least two occasions, Suffolk attempted to affect the outcome of a local parliamentary election, and the appointment of the county sheriff. Furthermore, he was a justice of the peace in Berkshire and Oxfordshire in the later 1460s. He involved himself {{in some of the most}} controversial episodes in East Anglian society of the time, for instance, attempting to purchase part of the by-then somewhat infamous Fastolf inheritance in 1461. This was another occasion in fact where we may in fact see his mother's guiding hand at work, as she is known to have been canvassing for support at court for such an outcome, and even Margaret Paston believed her to be personally behind the attacks. Both of them were involved in a severe feud with the Paston family as a result of conflicting interests in the Fastolf inheritance. The duke also made other disputed (and in some cases outrightly illegal) claims to other properties in the region over the following decade, and in 1465, a group of his retainers destroyed the manor house of Hellesdon, ransacking its church. For these and other illegalities alleged by contemporaries, Suffolk escaped retribution, probably due to his royal connections. On the other hand, he was never able to use such connections to his advantage and persuade the king to intercede in any disputes on the duke's behalf.|$|E

In this article, we investigate the chances of former flexible workers to be employed in <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> full-time <b>position.</b> In two field experiments, we asked for employers' evaluation of applicants with a flexible employment history. Results indicate that former part-time work is in fact perceived as a disadvantage for candidates when applying for <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> full-time <b>position</b> while other types of flexible work (e. g., fixed term contracts, part-time work, and interorganizational mobility) are not. Implications of these results for individual careers and employers' understanding of personnel are discussed...|$|R
