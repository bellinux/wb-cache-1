25|$|The {{incidence}} of fluorescence across {{the tree of}} life is widespread, and has been studied most extensively in a phylogenetic sense in fish. The phenomenon appears to have evolved multiple times in multiple taxa such as in the <b>anguilliformes</b> (eels), gobioidei (gobies and cardinalfishes), and tetradontiformes (triggerfishes), along with the other taxa discussed later in the article. Fluorescence is highly genotypically and phenotypically variable even within ecosystems, in regards to the wavelengths emitted, the patterns displayed, and the intensity of the fluorescence. Generally, the species relying upon camouflage exhibit the greatest diversity in fluorescence, likely because camouflage {{is one of the most}} common uses of fluorescence.|$|E
5000|$|The Anguilloidei are a {{suborder}} of {{the order}} <b>Anguilliformes</b> (the eels) containing six families: ...|$|E
5000|$|An eel is any fish {{belonging}} to the order <b>Anguilliformes</b> (...) , which consists of four suborders, 20 families, 111 genera and about 800 species. Most eels are predators. The term [...] "eel" [...] (originally referring to the European eel) is also used for some other similarly shaped fish, such as electric eels and spiny eels, {{but these are not}} members of the <b>Anguilliformes</b> order.|$|E
50|$|In some classifications, {{the family}} Cyematidae of bobtail snipe eels is {{included}} in the <b>Anguilliformes,</b> but in the FishBase system that family {{is included in}} the order Saccopharyngiformes.|$|E
50|$|The {{blackfin}} sorcerer (Nettastoma melanurum) is {{a species}} of saltwater eel in the family Nettastomatidae of the order <b>Anguilliformes.</b> It is found only in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
50|$|Despite its name, the {{electric}} eel is not {{closely related to}} the true eels (<b>Anguilliformes),</b> but {{is a member of the}} neotropical knifefish order (Gymnotiformes), which is more {{closely related to the}} catfish.|$|E
50|$|The European conger, Conger conger, is {{the largest}} of the family and of the <b>Anguilliformes</b> order that {{includes}} it; it has been recorded at up to 3 m in length and weighing 350 lb.|$|E
50|$|The eel is a long, thin bony fish of {{the order}} <b>Anguilliformes.</b> Because {{fishermen}} never caught anything they recognized as young eels, {{the life cycle of}} the eel was a mystery for a very long period of scientific history. Although more than 6500 publications mention eels, much of their life history remains an enigma.|$|E
5000|$|The monkeyface prickleback (Cebidichthys violaceus), also {{commonly}} known as the monkeyface eel, is a species of prickleback native to the Pacific coast of North America. Despite being commonly called an eel due to its body shape, it does not fall into the fish order <b>Anguilliformes</b> with true eels, but the Perciformes along with most bony fishes.|$|E
50|$|The {{superorder}} Elopomorpha {{contains a}} variety of types of fishes that range from typical silvery-colored species, such as the tarpons and ladyfishes of the Elopiformes and the bonefishes of the Albuliformes, to the long and slender, smooth-bodied eels of the <b>Anguilliformes.</b> The one characteristic uniting this group of fishes is they all have leptocephalus larvae, which are unique to the Elopomorpha. No other fishes have this type of larvae.|$|E
5000|$|The carpet eel-blenny (Congrogadus subducens), {{also known}} as the green wolf eel or green wolf eel blenny, is a {{relatively}} large species of dottyback found in coastal parts of the Indo-West Pacific, including coral reefs, among rocks, seagrass beds, tidal flats and in brackish habitats. Despite the names, it is unrelated to the true wolf eel of the North Pacific, the true eel of the order <b>Anguilliformes</b> and the true blennies of the suborder Blennioidei.|$|E
5000|$|The cusk-eel family, Ophidiidae, is a {{group of}} marine bony fishes in the order Ophidiiformes. The {{scientific}} name is from the Greek ophis meaning [...] "snake", and refers to their eel-like appearance. However, they can be distinguished from true eels of the order <b>Anguilliformes</b> by their ventral fins, which are developed into a forked barbel-like organ below the mouth in the cusk-eels; in the true eels by contrast they are never well-developed and usually missing entirely.|$|E
5000|$|The snub-nosed spiny eel, Notacanthus chemnitzii, is {{a member}} of the family Notacanthidae, the deep-sea spiny eels, which are not true eels (<b>Anguilliformes).</b> The snub-nosed spiny eel exists in waters all over the world, except in the tropics, ranging in color from light tan to bluish grey in small ones to dark brown in large ones. [...] Its primary food is sea anemones. [...] The eel usually lives in deep waters, mostly more than 200 m below the surface.|$|E
50|$|Genypterus capensis (Smith, 1847), {{commonly}} known as kingklip, is a species of cusk eel occurring along the Southern African coast from Walvis Bay in Namibia to Algoa Bay in South Africa, and {{is closely related to}} Genypterus blacodes from New Zealand. The species grows to a maximum length of 180 cm, a weight of 15.0 kg, {{and is one of the}} most popular fish items on South African menus. Despite appearances it is not closely related to the eel familyof <b>Anguilliformes.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of leptocephali {{can be summarized}} briefly. The eggs of eels in the <b>Anguilliformes</b> order are quite large compared to those of many other fishes. They are about 1-4 mm in diameter. Once the larvae are newly hatched, the yolk extends posteriorly. Some larvae hatch with features of the head more developed than others. The preleptocephalus stage is the period immediately after the larvae hatch. During this stage, the larvae do not yet feed externally. These larvae typically have poorly developed eyes and few or no teeth.|$|E
50|$|The pelican eel (Eurypharynx pelecanoides) is a {{deep-sea fish}} rarely seen by humans, {{though it is}} {{occasionally}} caught in fishing nets. It is an eel-like fish and the only known member of the genus Eurypharynx and the family Eurypharyngidae. It belongs to the order Saccopharyngiformes, which {{is closely related to}} the true eels in <b>Anguilliformes.</b> It is also referred to as the gulper eel, pelican gulper, and umbrella-mouth gulper. The specific epithet pelecanoides refers to the pelican, as the fish's large mouth is reminiscent of that of the bird.|$|E
50|$|These eel-like fishes {{range in}} size from 8 - 48 inches (20 - 150 cm). Although they are eel-like, they are not related to true eels (<b>Anguilliformes).</b> The premaxillae are present as {{distinct}} bones and are nonprotrusible. The gills are poorly developed, and their openings are usually single, small, confluent across the breast, and restricted to {{the lower half of the}} body. Oxygen is absorbed through the membranes of the throat or intestine. The dorsal and anal fins are low and continuous around the tail tip. Pelvic fins are absent. Scales are either absent or very small. They lack a swim bladder.|$|E
5000|$|Ophichthidae is {{a family}} of fish in the order <b>Anguilliformes,</b> {{commonly}} known as the Snake eels. The term [...] "Ophichthidae" [...] comes from Greek ophis ("serpent") and ichthys ("fish"). Snake eels are also burrowing eels, they are named for their physical appearance, they have long, cylindrical snakelike bodies. This family is found worldwide in tropical to warm temperate waters. They inhabit a wide range of habitats, from coastal shallows and even rivers, to depths of above 800 m. Most species are bottom dwellers, hiding in mud or sand to capture their prey of crustaceans and small fish, but some are pelagic.|$|E
50|$|They can propel {{themselves}} over wet grass and dig through wet sand to reach upstream headwaters and ponds, thus colonising the continent. In fresh water, they develop pigmentation, turn into elvers (young eels), and feed on creatures such as small crustaceans, worms, and insects. After 10 to 14 years, they have matured and grown to {{a length of}} 60 to 80 cm. At this stage, they are called yellow eels because of their golden pigmentation. Marine eels of the order <b>Anguilliformes</b> also have a leptocephalus stage, and likely pass through a stage similar to the anguillid glass eels, but they are rarely seen in the ocean.|$|E
50|$|The {{incidence}} of fluorescence across {{the tree of}} life is widespread, and has been studied most extensively in a phylogenetic sense in fish. The phenomenon appears to have evolved multiple times in multiple taxa such as in the <b>anguilliformes</b> (eels), gobioidei (gobies and cardinalfishes), and tetradontiformes (triggerfishes), along with the other taxa discussed later in the article. Fluorescence is highly genotypically and phenotypically variable even within ecosystems, in regards to the wavelengths emitted, the patterns displayed, and the intensity of the fluorescence.

5000|$|Leptocephalus (meaning [...] "slim head") is {{the flat}} and {{transparent}} larva of the eel, marine eels, {{and other members}} of the superorder Elopomorpha. This is one of the most diverse groups of teleosts, containing 801 species in 24 orders, 24 families, and 156 genera. This group is thought to have arisen in the Cretaceous period over 140 million years ago. Fishes with a leptocephalus larval stage include the most familiar eels such as the conger, moray eel, and garden eel as well as members of the family Anguillidae, plus more than 10 other families of lesser-known types of marine eels. These are all true eels of the order <b>Anguilliformes.</b> The fishes of the other four traditional orders of elopomorph fishes that have this type of larvae are more diverse in their body forms and include the tarpon, bonefish, spiny eel, and pelican eel.|$|E
50|$|The Asian swamp eel is a {{freshwater}} eel-like fish {{belonging to}} the family Synbranchidae. This family is native to the fresh, brackish, tropical, and subtropical waters of Asia, but is now present in West Africa and North, Central, and South America. Its taxonomy, however, is incorrect. Though Monopterus albus was initially {{thought to be a}} single species, four known populations of the “species” in the southeastern United States may actually be three distinct species or taxa, each originating from a different area in Asia. Monopterus albus is placed in the class or subclass Actinopterygii. It arose from the Osteichthyes, the first bony fish, whose fossil record dates back to the Triassic period. In turn, the bony fish came from the Acanthodii class of bony and cartilaginous fish. The common name of M. albus is somewhat of a misnomer, as the Asian swamp eel is not an eel, per se. Eels are of the order <b>Anguilliformes,</b> while M. albus is of the order Synbranchiformes.|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} Proctophantastes nettastomatis (Digenea: Zoogonidae; Lepidophyllinae) {{found in the}} {{intestine}} of three species of deep-sea fish, Dicrolene longimana (Ophidiidae, Ophidiiformes), Bathyuroconger sp. (Congridae, <b>Anguilliformes),</b> and Venefica tentaculata (Nettastomatidae, <b>Anguilliformes).</b> The fish were collected near the islands of Espiritu Santo, Erromango, and Epi, respectively, in the archipelago of Vanuatu (Southern Pacific Ocean) at depths ranging from 561 to 990 m. Morphological and histological analyses showed that the Vanuatu specimens differ from Proctophantastes abyssorum, Proctophantastes gillissi, Proctophantastes glandulosum, Proctophantastes infundibulum, and Proctophantastes brayi but are close to P. nettastomatis discovered in Suruga Bay, Japan. P. nettastomatis is redescribed based both on the observations of our specimens and of the Japanese holotype and paratype. The morphological variability of the species is described. Morphometric data allowed the identification of positive allometric growth for the hindbody, negative allometric growth for the ventral sucker, and a growth phenotypic plasticity between Ophidiiformes and <b>Anguilliformes</b> definitive hosts...|$|E
40|$|Localization of the ribosomal {{genes in}} <b>Anguilliformes</b> (Chordata, Osteichthyes) E. Coluccia, R. Cannas, A. Milia, A. M. Deiana, S. Salvadori Dipartimento di Biologia Animale ed Ecologia, Università di Cagliari, Viale Poetto 1, 09126 Cagliari, Italy Keywords: <b>Anguilliformes,</b> FISH, ribosomal genes Ribosomal genes are {{organized}} in two multiple tandemly-arrayed units: the major family encoding for 28 S, 18 S and 5. 8 S rRNA and localized in the {{nucleolar organizer region}} (NOR), and the minor family encoding for 5 S rRNA. Their chromosomal localization represents useful markers for karyotype analysis and for {{the investigation of the}} phylogenetic relationships among related species, especially in fishes in which euchromatic structural banding patterns are difficult to obtain. In the present study, the chromosomal evolution of rDNA within the <b>Anguilliformes</b> order was studied through the mapping by FISH of the two ribosomal gene families in some species from different families, and by comparison with data on other <b>Anguilliformes.</b> 45 S rDNA has been mapped in Gymnothorax unicolor (Muraenidae), Conger conger (Congridae), Ophisurus serpens and Echelus myrus (Ophichthidae); it was detected only in a chromosome pair in all species, as in the other previously studied <b>Anguilliformes.</b> This situation is the most frequent in teleosteans. A terminal localization on the short arm of a submetacentric and subtelocentric chromosome pair was found in O. serpens and C. conger respectively; this is the most frequent situation among <b>Anguilliformes</b> and fishes in general; an interstitial location on a acrocentric chromosome pair was detected for G. unicolor and E. myrus. NOR is positive to silver staining and CMA 3 banding in all species in which these techniques have been applied. Between the two Mediterranean moray eels (Muraena helena and G. unicolor) a pericentric inversion involved the NOR bearing pair. The ribosomal gene families are located on separate chromosome pairs in Anguilla anguilla and A. rostrata  1, 2  and in most fishes. In the present study in M. helena, the 5 S gene family has been mapped on a pair other than NOR, while in C. conger, both 5 S and 45 S rDNA were clustered in the same chromosome region. 1 Martínez J.

40|$|The {{morphology}} of {{the digestive}} tract of Whitespotted conger, Conger myriaster (Elopomorpha: <b>Anguilliformes)</b> was examined by light and scanning electron microscopy. The digestive tracts consist of esophagus, stomach, and intestine; no pyloric caeca were observed. The stomach was divided into cardiac, body, terminal and pyloric region. The esophagus was composed of two layers of striated muscularis; inner longitudinal layer and outer circular layer. The former was extended to the body region of the stomach. In contrast, the latter was terminated to the esophagus, and became coincident to the boundary of the outer longitudinal layer consisting of smooth muscle in the cardiac region of the stomach. The terminal region of the stomach was characterized by the thick longitudinal muscularis and subserosa, and the gastric glands were absent. Ciliated cells were distributed in the intestinal wall. The digestive tract secreted both acidic and neutral mucus throughout all regions. We found that the terminal region of the stomach is characteristic of <b>Anguilliformes.</b> On the other hand, the striated muscle within the body region of the stomach was unique among the <b>Anguilliformes.</b> These differences in stomach suggested the possible existence of morphologica...|$|E

40|$|An {{annotated}} {{checklist of}} eels, orders <b>Anguilliformes</b> and Saccopharyngiformes, occurring in Taiwanese waters is presented. The checklist {{is the result}} of a series of systematic studies conducted by the authors in the past few years. The eel fauna of Taiwan is one of the richest in the world with a total of 206 species in 74 genera and 13 families in <b>Anguilliformes</b> and a single species in Saccopharyngiformes. The most species-rich families are the Muraenidae with 71 species, followed by the Ophichthidae with 60 species, the Congridae with 29 species, and the Synaphobranchidae with 17 species. Moreover, three genera and 42 species have been described based on at least one type specimen collected from Taiwan. Of these, 36 species are recognized as valid and 23 species are known only from Taiwanese waters at present. Historical records of all Taiwanese eel species are reviewed by examining the original descriptions and figures, vouchers, as well as the recently collected specimens, where available. This represents the first detailed checklist of eels from Taiwanese waters...|$|E
40|$|The {{location}} of the major and minor ribosomal gene families in the conger eel (Conger conger) was investigated by in situ hybridization and CMA(3) staining. The two gene families were localized in only one chromosome pair, on the short arm of pair 19, in an entirely CMA(3) -positive region. Among the <b>Anguilliformes,</b> C. conger is the only species that shows {{the presence of the}} two gene families in the same chromosomal region...|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of an enigmatic, small eel-like fish from a 35 m-deep fringing-reef cave in the western Pacific Ocean Republic of Palau that exhibits an unusual suite of morphological characters. Many of these uniquely characterize the Recent members of the 19 families comprising the elopomorph order <b>Anguilliformes,</b> the true eels. Others are found among anguilliforms only in the Cretaceous fossils, and still others are primitive with respect to both Recent and fossil eels. Thus, morphological evidence explicitly places it as the most basal lineage (i. e. the sister group of extant anguilliforms). Phylogenetic analysis and divergence time estimation based on whole mitogenome sequences from various actinopterygians, including representatives of all eel families, demonstrate that this fish {{represents one of the}} most basal, independent lineages of the true eels, with a long evolutionary history comparable to that of the entire <b>Anguilliformes</b> (approx. 200 Myr). Such a long, independent evolutionary history dating back to the early Mesozoic and a retention of primitive morphological features (e. g. the presence of a premaxilla, metapterygoid, free symplectic, gill rakers, pseudobranch and distinct caudal fin rays) warrant recognition of this species as a ‘living fossil’ of the true eels, herein described as Protanguilla palau genus et species nov. in the new family Protanguillidae...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of (TTAGGG) n telomeric repeats was studied in chromosomes of two Atlantic eels,Anguilla anguilla andA. rostrata. We {{found that these}} sequences hybridize to all the telomeres {{but also to the}} entire nucleolar organizer region (NOR) localized in both species at the short arm of chromosome 8. This was considered to be due to the interspersion of telomeric sequences within the NOR ones. Whatever the significance of this interspersion may be, it seems to be limited toA. anguilla andA. rostrata since inMuraena helena (family muraenidae), which also belongs to the <b>Anguilliformes,</b> no telomeric hybridization signals were found along the NOR regions...|$|E
