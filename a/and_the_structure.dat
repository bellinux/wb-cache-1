5|$|A {{disastrous}} {{fire started}} {{on the seventh floor}} on the night of 16 March 1954 and spread downwards. The keepers had no time to raise the alarm and were driven out of the lighthouse onto the rocks but rescued the next day when the relief vessel arrived as part of its regular schedule. The heat of the fire caused damage to both the interior <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> and a lightship and series of temporary lights were installed during reconstruction. Three new generators were placed in the lighthouse to provide an electric light source, the lantern being re-lit on 6 August 1959.|$|E

5|$|Alboin's {{problems}} in maintaining {{control over his}} people worsened during the siege of Ticinum. The nature of the Lombard monarchy {{made it difficult for}} a ruler to exert the same degree of authority over his subjects as had been exercised by Theodoric over his Goths, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or duces, who led each band (fara) of warriors. Additionally, the difficulties encountered by Alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy, as unlike the Ostrogoths, they had not entered Italy as foederati but as enemies of the Empire.|$|E
5|$|Almost 100 {{people were}} {{beheaded}} in Halifax {{between the first}} recorded execution in 1286 and the last in 1650, but as {{the date of the}} gibbet's installation is uncertain, it cannot be determined with any accuracy how many were dealt with by the Halifax Gibbet. By 1650 public opinion considered beheading to be an excessively severe punishment for petty theft; use of the gibbet was forbidden by Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> was dismantled. The stone base was rediscovered and preserved in about 1840, and a non-working replica was erected on the site in 1974. The names of 52 people known to have been beheaded by the device are listed on a nearby plaque.|$|E
5|$|At the Canning Dam {{and indeed}} all dams, care {{had to be}} taken to prevent water seepage between the {{foundation}} rock <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> of the dam. At the Canning in addition to cutting back the foundation to solid unfractured rock, a cut-off trench was sited near the upstream face of the dam, down stream which a rock filled drain containing open jointed pipes was provided to intercept any seepage between the rock face and the concrete of the dam. The inclusion of an internal drainage system was considered innovative at the period. Near vertical tubular 8 in (200mm) cut-off drains were provided at five-foot (1.52 m) intervals along the dam to relieve internal seepage through the concrete.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTwo {{iteration}} {{methods are}} proposed to solve real nonsymmetric positive definite Toeplitz systems of linear equations. These methods {{are based on}} Hermitian and skew-Hermitian splitting (HSS) and accelerated Hermitian and skew-Hermitian splitting (AHSS). By constructing an orthogonal matrix and using a similarity transformation, the real Toeplitz linear system {{is transformed into a}} generalized saddle point problem. Then <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> HSS <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> AHSS iteration methods are established by applying <b>the</b> HSS <b>and</b> <b>the</b> AHSS iteration methods to the generalized saddle point problem. We discuss efficient implementations <b>and</b> demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> HSS <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> AHSS iteration methods have better behavior than the HSS iteration method in terms of both computational complexity and convergence speed. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> AHSS iteration method outperforms <b>the</b> HSS <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> HSS iteration methods. <b>The</b> <b>structured</b> AHSS iteration method also converges unconditionally to the unique solution of the Toeplitz linear system. In addition, an upper bound for the contraction factor of <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> AHSS iteration method is derived. Numerical experiments are used to illustrate the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> AHSS iteration method...|$|R

5|$|Negotiations {{between the}} owners, led by {{commissioner}} David Stern, and the players, led by director Billy Hunter and president Derek Fisher {{of the labor}} union National Basketball Players Association (NBPA), began in early 2011 and continued through November.

Owners proposed to reduce the players' share of basketball related income (BRI) from 57% to 47%, but the players countered with 53% of BRI. Owners wanted to implement a hard salary cap and a harsher luxury tax, hoping to increase competition among teams, whereas players {{wanted to keep the}} current soft salary cap structure intact.|$|E

5|$|On 22 August 1978, Kenyatta {{died in the}} State House, Mombasa. As {{a result}} of the UK's longstanding {{experience}} in state funerals, the Kenyan government requested British assistance in organising Kenyatta's. McKenzie was employed as a go-between, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> of the funeral was orchestrated to deliberately imitate that of deceased British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. In doing so, senior Kenyans sought to project an image of their country as a modern nation-state rather than one incumbent on tradition. The funeral took place at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, six days after Kenyatta's death. Britain's first heir to the throne, Charles, Prince of Wales, attended the event, a symbol of the value that the British government perceived in its relationship with Kenya.|$|E
5|$|Open-spandrel {{segmental}} arch bridge: The earliest known fully stone open-spandrel {{segmental arch}} bridge is the Zhaozhou Bridge in southern Hebei province, China, completed in 605 by the Sui Dynasty (581–618) engineer Li Chun. The bridge span is 37.5m (123ft) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> relatively light in weight {{due to the}} four semi-circular arch spandrels which allow for additional flood waters to pass through. Other Chinese bridges would be influenced by this design, such as the open-spandrel Yongtong Bridge of Zhaoxian, Hebei built in 1130, and the simple segmental arch Lugou Bridge built in 1698 (originally in 1189). The latter, located just west of Beijing and features eleven segmental arches.|$|E
