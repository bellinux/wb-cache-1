25|$|<b>Although</b> <b>Our</b> Southern Highlanders gives {{invaluable}} {{descriptions of}} {{several aspects of}} life in the Smokies in the early 1900s, the book has been criticized for focusing too much on the more sensational facets of mountain life, such as moonshining and those families living in extreme poverty. And while Kephart claimed he received positive feedback from the mountain people, former Hazel Creek resident Duane Oliver recalled that the book angered many of the creek's residents for the stereotypical way in which it portrayed them.|$|E

25|$|Davidson {{argues that}} as a culture, our {{attention}} blindness represents a significant challenge that we must examine and meet head on; particularly since the Internet has revolutionized virtually every aspect of how our lives function now.

She claims that those in educational and corporate spheres continue to operate in 20th century modes (founded {{to meet the challenges of}} industrialization) as though we were currently not living through momentous, epochal changes.|$|E
25|$|Frank R. Freemon (1976) {{thinks that}} the above reasons given by modern biographers of Muhammad in {{rejection}} of epilepsy come from the widespread misconceptions about {{the various types of}} epilepsy. In his differential diagnosis, Freemon rejects schizophrenic hallucinations, drug-induced mental changes such as might occur after eating plants containing hallucinogenic materials, transient ischemic attacks, hypoglycemia, labyrinthitis, Ménière's disease, or other inner ear maladies. At the end, Freemon argues that if one were forced to make a diagnosis psychomotor seizures of temporal lobe epilepsy would be the most tenable one, <b>although</b> <b>our</b> lack of scientific as well as historical knowledge makes unequivocal decision impossible. Freemon cites evidences supporting and opposing this diagnosis. In the end, Freemon points out that a medical diagnosis should not ignore Muhammad’s moral message because it is just as likely, perhaps more likely, for God communicate with a person in an abnormal state of mind.|$|E
25|$|Following their marriage, Ward and his {{new wife}} {{returned}} to Chicago where he began work on his next major play, Our Lan' in 1941. The outbreak of World War II, however, delayed the play's first production and, in the interim, Ward was forced to take on odd jobs to support his new family. After brief stints as a factory laborer, a bootblack, and {{a writer for the}} Office of War Information, Ward eventually returned to teaching and helped to create several adult writing seminars that he led in Chicago and New Orleans. After the war's end, Ward was finally able to begin publicizing his play about the Reconstruction Era of the United States South. The script earned him a prestigious Theatre Guild Award in 1945 and managed to generate enough interest for the work to premiere at the Henry Street Settlement Playhouse in 1947 and, after a successful showing, transferred to Broadway’s Royale Theatre for 42 performances. <b>Although</b> <b>Our</b> Lan had a relatively short run, the play's premiere on Broadway distinguished Ward {{as one of the few}} black writers that was able to get work produced on Broadway following the end of the Harlem Renaissance.|$|E

2500|$|Demetrius Charles de Kavanagh Boulger stated at {{the time}} that the {{strength}} of the Qing has been thoroughly demonstrated and that her prestige remained unsullied. [...] "Whatever danger there may be to the permanence of Qing's triumph lies rather from Russia than from the peoples of Tian Shan Nan Lu; nor is there much danger that the Chinese laurels will become faded even before a European foe. Zuo Zongtang and his generals such as Jin Shun and Chang Yao, accomplished a task which would reflect credit on any army and any country. They have given a luster to the modern Chinese administration which must stand it in good stead, and they have acquired a personal renown that will not easily depart. The Qing reconquest of Xinjiang is beyond doubt the most remarkable event that has occurred in Asia during the last fifty years, and it is quite the most brilliant achievement of a Chinese army, led by Chinese generals, that has taken place since the Qianlong Emperor subdued the country more than a century ago. It also proves, in a manner that is more than unpalatable to us, that the Chinese possess an adaptive faculty that must be held to be a very important fact in every-day politics in Central Asia. They reconquered Kashgaria with European weapons and by careful study of Western science and technology. Their soldiers marched in obedience to instructors trained on the Prussian principle; and their generals maneuvered their troops in accordance with the teachings of Moltke and Manteuffel. Even in such minor matters as the use of telescopes and field glasses we could find this Chinese army well supplied. Nothing was more absurd than the picture drawn by some over-wise observer of this army, as consisting of soldiers fantastically garbed in the guise of dragons and other hideous appearances. All that belonged to an old-world theory. The rebel troops were as widely different from all previous Chinese armies in Central Asia as it well could be; and in all essentials closely resembled that of a European power. Its remarkable triumphs were chiefly attributable to the thoroughness with which China had in this instance adapted herself to Western notions". [...] "But, <b>although</b> <b>our</b> hands are tied in Central Asia, they are not fettered at Pekin, and we certainly should congratulate, if we have not done so already, the Chinese on their remarkable successes in the Tian Shan regions. That step might be pregnant with beneficent results, and our desire to be on good terms with our new, yet our old, neighbour might be met in a cordial manner by the Chinese." ...|$|E
