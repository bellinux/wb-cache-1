The Chart of Accounts applicable to credit institutions includes class-two accounts Operations with clients and expenses and revenues accounts, which help record the <b>adjustments</b> <b>for</b> receivables <b>depreciation</b> in operations with clients. To constitute, diminish or annul depreciations, credit institutions have the obligation to assure the classification of their credits based on classification categories according to three criteria: financial performance, debt service and initiation of juridical procedures. By the present study, we present the way the credit portfolio is structured according to the criteria mentioned and the reflection in accounting of the prudential adjustments of value. The article ends with the authors’ conclusions regarding the specificity {{of the way of}} classification of the credits according to risk categories in agreement to the evolution of the class determination criteria...|$|R

This article is written primarily for the benefit of Diploma in Accountancy students doing basic accounting. Students from other discipline of studies sitting for their basic accounting examination can also benefit from this article. This article will focus on the preparation of financial statements for a trading business namely the Trading and Profit and Loss Accounts and the Balance Sheet at year-end. Some year-end adjustments must also be taken into account when preparing the trader's financial statements. However, this article will only cover two aspects of the year-end adjustments. First <b>adjustment</b> is providing <b>for</b> <b>depreciation</b> <b>for</b> fixed assets. Second adjustments are writing off bad debts and providing for doubtful debts for debtors...|$|R
40|$|Performance evaluation: {{how should}} it be assessed? And can {{accounting}} and economic concepts be reconciled? The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to consider how investment decisions should be evaluated. The usefulness of accounting profit and economic income are contrasted by the different purposes each serves. Whether these income concepts can be reconciled is considered. Given that many accounting theorists (for example, Solomons, 1961; Beaver, 1981; and Schipper and Vincent, 2003) accept economic income as the ideal, it is necessary to draw attention again to its unsuitability for measurement of profit for a past period. In advocating an “opportunity cost measure ” of performance Edwards, Kay and Mayer (1987) forswore against the use economic income, instead drawing support from accounting theorists favouring replacement costs. However, managers largely rely on present value analysis in reaching investment decisions. Hence, evaluating their performance using accounting profit gives rise to an apparent conflict between accounting profit and the economic basis applied in the investment decision. Whether economic value added (EVA), advocated as a means of overcoming this conflict, can adequately reconcile the two approaches is therefore explored. In addition, accounting and economic rates of return are reconciled, and the use of replacement cost as a surrogate for present values is found wanting. The strength of EVA is that the cash flows underpinning the present value basis used in the original decision become the commencing point for the evaluation. In this hybrid approach, the actual cash flows used in the measurement of periodic accounting profit can then be compared with expectations of them. How far this analysis can be used depends on the authority of the decision maker being evaluated. If the decision maker simply applies a top management imposed “rate of return ” as the discount factor, then comparison of the cash flows probably represents the extent of the analysis. In the case of a division organised as a profit centre the full EVA approach including <b>adjustments</b> <b>for</b> <b>depreciation</b> and the cost of capital may be relevant. Whether it could be applied to the entity as a whole will depend on the contract written with the CEO. Key words: performance evaluation, accounting profit, economic income, EVA...|$|R
40|$|A {{simulation}} model based on classical population dynamics is developed {{to estimate the}} benefit-cost ratio performance of different typologies of housing {{with the purpose of}} identifying potential reductions in the total costs and hence resources used to sustain housing. A typical New Zealand dwelling constructed of lightweight timber framing is used as an example. Dwellings within the {{simulation model}} undergo periodic cycles of refurbishment based on best practices. When the simulated housing stock expands at the rate of 1. 5 % per year, an annual expenditure equivalent to the costs to construct one dwelling sustains the services provided by 26. 7 dwellings after <b>adjustment</b> <b>for</b> economic <b>depreciation.</b> This benefit-cost ratio performance improves by 32. 4 % when the housing stock is stationary. Further improvements of 5. 3 % can be achieved by deferring refurbishment and accepting a higher level of economic depreciation of dwelling services. The results of all scenarios indicate that structural systems with a service life of only 50 years should not be used unless the costs of such systems are substantially less than the costs of traditional structural systems and that lightweight timber framed dwellings should not be sustained well beyond a service life of 90 years. sustainability, housing stock, simulation model, benefit-cost ratio,...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{begins by}} {{outlining}} the major administrative and compliance issues of a cash flow tax. There are {{problems with the}} system because of the numerous possibilities for gaming the system. The paper goes on to discuss the problems involved in {{the transition from a}} corporate income tax to a cash flow tax. There are ways around these problems but they cause further problems. The paper outlines these secondary problems and possible solutions to them, but concludes that there is no easy way to orchestrate a totally smooth transition. The international aspects of imposing a cash flow tax are most troublesome. After a summary of the major international income tax rules, the paper discusses how the cashflow tax treats inbound investment, outbound investment, and exports and imports. The paper concludes by proposing one way to fix up the income tax. It suggests that the tax base be defined in terms of financial income with certain specific <b>adjustments,</b> such as <b>for</b> <b>depreciation</b> and extraordinary items. The proposal is of some depth, including a simplified system of tax depreciation.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{critically}} analyze {{the relationship that}} professors Dornbusch and Fischer establish among the concepts of GNP, NNP and aggregate income. In principle, aggregate income is NNP; indeed, {{the whole point of}} introducing the concept of NNP is to determine what is the income of the economy in the aggregate. The definition of NNP excludes depreciation from aggregate income. But depreciation must be made good, and it must be so out of current production. On the ground that the factors that produce the goods that make up <b>for</b> <b>depreciation</b> must be paid, Dornbusch and Fischer conclude that the value of the portion of current output that makes up <b>for</b> <b>depreciation</b> becomes income in the aggregate. Since it is indubitable that the value of the other portion of output (that which consists of the goods not required to make up <b>for</b> <b>depreciation)</b> becomes income too, then it follows that aggregate income is GNP, not NNP. Then, Dornbusch and Fischer hold contradictory views. The cause, which I attempt at diagnosing in this paper, is a miscomprehension of the nature of capitalistic production. national accounting, accounting identities, capital accounting, national income accounting...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 The issues {{featured}} {{in this study are}} the vulnerability to inflation of several depreciation methods allowed by the Internal Revenue Service (straight-line, sum-of-the years and declining balance), possible consequences when depreciation allowances are based on historical cost and are not updated to price level changes, two proposals under national consideration (First Year Capital Recovery System and Capital Cost Recovery Act) to modify the way in which depreciation allowances are calculated, and several suggested procedures to compensate for the loss of purchasing power in depreciation. It is concluded that under inflation and when depreciation allowances are expressed in present dollars, additional taxation occurs and the original rate of return of the project decreases. To mitigate these circumstances, adjustments are needed. The magnitude of <b>adjustments</b> is evaluated <b>for</b> each of the main existing depreciation methods. It is shown that straight line method is itself an inflationary force. Numerical examples are presented. Two current proposals to modify the way in which depreciation allowances are calculated are described. Under Capital Cost Recovery Act and First Year Capital Recovery System, the risk of purchasing power loss because of inflation is reduced, and the mechanics are simple. However, depreciation is still based on historical cost. As a consequence, capital recovery is not adequate, although, it is superior to the recovery provided for existing methods. It is shown that several procedures can provide <b>for</b> <b>adjustments</b> in <b>depreciation</b> charges according to price level changes and better recover funds invested in capital assets. However, uncertainty of future inflation rates, loss of tax revenue for the government and sometimes complicated mechanics are the primary disadvantages...|$|R
