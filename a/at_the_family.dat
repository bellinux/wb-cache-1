5|$|In {{the scene}} when Homer, Bart and Lisa pick up Maggie from the daycare center, babies are perched {{all over the}} building, staring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> and quietly sucking on pacifiers. This is a spoof of the final shot of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds. Indeed, a cartoon-version of Hitchcock can be seen walking his dogs past the daycare, a {{reference}} to his own cameo appearance in the film. The episode also contains an allusion to the opera scene in Citizen Kane, in which Homer plays with a shredded playbill while he watches {{his wife in the}} musical.|$|E

5|$|Sir George Rose, Member of Parliament for Christchurch {{and close}} friend and advisor to the Prime Minister William Pitt, built a home, 'Sandhills', at Mudeford. His other great friend, King George III often visited, helping to promote Christchurch as a tourist destination. Sandhills was home to George Rose's two sons: {{politician}} and diplomat Sir George Henry Rose, and poet William Rose, who both served as Members of Parliament for Christchurch. Field Marshal Hugh Rose, 1st Baron Strathnairn, son of Sir George Henry Rose spent time living <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> home.|$|E
5|$|The young Harriet {{spent much}} of her {{childhood}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> home at Fulbeck Hall in Lincolnshire, sited high on the limestone hills above Grantham. The house, which had been given to Henry Fane by his father, was a not over-large modern mansion at the time of Arbuthnot's childhood. It was rebuilt following a fire in 1733, and further extended and modernised in 1784 by Henry Fane. At Fulbeck Harriet and her 13 siblings enjoyed a comfortable and reasonably affluent rural childhood.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War, Waddington was {{appointed}} chairman of the North Eastern Division Advisory Committee for the Control of Oils and Fats and became an agent of the Ministry of Food. His responsibilities included arranging for the storage of fats. When the war concluded, he was charged with conspiracy to defraud the Ministry of Food when it was discovered that a letter detailing amounts of money had been altered. The prosecution alleged that between 1943 and 1944, Waddington and the manager of another fat storage firm shared £1,600 between them which should have gone to the latter's company when the price paid by the Ministry for storage increased. Waddington denied all knowledge; his brother Priestley, another director <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> firm, said that he made the arrangements to pay a portion of the increased fees to Waddington's co-defendant without the knowledge of Waddington. Waddington was acquitted when a judge ruled {{that there was no way}} that it could be proven that he had known of the alteration to the letter, or that he was in any way responsible.|$|E

5|$|Edward Gough Whitlam {{was born}} on 11 July 1916 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> home 'Ngara', 46 Rowland Street, Kew, a suburb of Melbourne. He was the older of two {{children}} (he had a younger sister, Freda) born to Martha (née Maddocks) and Fred Whitlam. His father was a federal public servant who later served as Commonwealth Crown Solicitor, and Whitlam senior's involvement in human rights issues was a powerful influence on his son. Since the boy's maternal grandfather was also named Edward, from early childhood he was called by his middle name, Gough, which in turn had come from his paternal grandfather, who had been named after the British soldier Field-Marshal Hugh Gough, 1st Viscount Gough.|$|E
5|$|Eliab Harvey {{was born}} in Chigwell, Essex to William and Emma Harvey. His father William Harvey was a Member of Parliament for Essex, but died when Harvey was only five years old, in 1763. Until 1768, Harvey was raised <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> estate of Rolls Park in Chigwell, which had passed to his elder brother William {{on the death of}} their father. Harvey then {{attended}} Westminster School for two years before moving to Harrow School in 1770. At the age of thirteen in 1771, Harvey was entered onto the books of the naval schooner HMS Mary, although he did not actually serve aboard the ship. Utilising a standard legal fiction of the time, Harvey's name was entered on the ship's books without his actual presence, a ruse that would provide him with sufficient seniority to gain rapid promotion when he did enter the navy. In his summer holidays from school, Harvey served at sea, joining HMS Orpheus in 1773.|$|E
5|$|Lethbridge's heart {{condition}} worsened, {{to the extent}} that he was unable to attend his mother's funeral in 1970. He eventually required 24-hour care, and was transferred to Nuffield Hospital in Exeter, where he died in his sleep on 30 September 1971. His body was interned <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> plot in Heytesbury, Wiltshire. As the Branscombe house was owned by the Lethbridge Family Trust, Mina was obliged to move out after her husband's death, and she sold his belongings out of financial necessity. Mina also collected together Lethbridge's unfinished book with the help of writer Colin Wilson; together they assembled it into publishable form and it was brought out by Routledge in 1976 as The Power of the Pendulum.|$|E

5|$|Living mammals {{are divided}} into the Yinotheria (platypus and echidnas) and Theriiformes (all other mammals). There are around 5450 species of mammal, {{depending}} on which authority is cited. In some classifications, extant mammals {{are divided into}} two subclasses: the Prototheria, that is, the order Monotremata; and the Theria, or the infraclasses Metatheria and Eutheria. The marsupials constitute the crown group of the Metatheria, and include all living metatherians {{as well as many}} extinct ones; the placentals are the crown group of the Eutheria. While mammal classification <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> level has been relatively stable, several contending classifications regarding the higher levels—subclass, infraclass and order, especially of the marsupials—appear in contemporaneous literature. Much of the changes reflect the advances of cladistic analysis and molecular genetics. Findings from molecular genetics, for example, have prompted adopting new groups, such as the Afrotheria, and abandoning traditional groups, such as the Insectivora.|$|E
5|$|Many of Rix Nicholas's works {{went into}} private {{collections}} for which records are limited. Many more were burned {{in a fire}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> property after her death in the 1960s. Though her fortunes declined {{in the latter part}} of her career, the twenty-first century saw a renewed appreciation of her output. Her oeuvre is represented in most major Australia public galleries, including the Art Gallery of South Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, and the Queensland Art Gallery, as well as in other collections including that of the Australian War Memorial. Internationally, Rix Nicholas is represented in the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume and Leicester Gallery, as well as by her works in the Luxembourg.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, former {{warehouse}} {{workers and}} lottery winners Calvin (Calvin Tenner) and Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) approach Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) asking for their jobs back {{as they made}} a bad investment in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals. Darryl accepts them back and shows them around the warehouse and introduces them to new foreman Val (Ameenah Kaplan). Val's boyfriend, Brandon (Jerry Minor), is also there with her and notices the blatant compliments that Darryl gives to Val. Brandon then tells Darryl off which he responds to by just simply walking away. Later, Darryl and his daughter, Jada, are taking pictures <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> portrait studio; Val joins them and holds Darryl's hand.|$|E

5|$|Promoted to captain, Holden {{finished}} {{the war as}} an instructor with No.6 (Training) Squadron in England, where his work earned him the Air Force Cross. After leaving the Australian Flying Corps in 1919, he became a manager <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> firm of Holden's Motor Body Builders and joined the part-time Citizen Air Force, before setting up as a commercial pilot and establishing his own air service. In 1929, he located Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm in the north-west Australian desert after the pair was reported missing on a flight to England in the Southern Cross. Holden began transport operations in New Guinea in 1931. He was killed the following year in a passenger plane crash in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Ramsay Weston Phipps was {{the second}} son of Pownoll Phipps and Phipps' third wife, the Irish-born Anna Charlotte Smith. Born <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> estate, Oaklands, in Tipperary, Ireland, he was named Ramsay in honor of an uncle who pioneered slave {{emancipation}} in the West Indies, and Weston after another uncle, a scientific clergyman. By 1841, his father had returned to England, to reside in Kent, where the family lived in Yalding. They lodged at the Parsonage with a local farmer, Ramsey Warde; Ramsey Warde was also a relative of Phipps' mother. The family of four included three-year-old Ramsay, his older brother, Pownoll (age five), his mother (age 30) and his father. Eventually, two more children joined the family: Henrietta Sophia and Robert Constantine, twins born 23 September 1841. The boy died 9 October, but Henrietta lived into adulthood, marrying Lieutenant-Colonel William Smith. After suffering a bout of measles in spring 1847, Ramsay Phipps attended Mr. Barron's School at Stanmore with his older brother, Pownoll, {{with the intent to}} following his brother {{in a year or two}} to Rugby in Warwickshire.|$|E
5|$|During Prohibition, Pflueger {{designed}} {{bars for}} private clubs {{such as the}} Stock Exchange Luncheon Club where members kept their personal bottles in small lockers behind the bar, and two bars for The Family, one <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> Farm in Woodside and one at the clubhouse in San Francisco. Pflueger created a cocktail bar and nightclub for Frank Martinelli and Tom Gerun in 1931, the Bal Tabarin, featuring a stage for live music and colorful indirect lighting from above metal fins in the ceiling and behind curved metal strips upstage. When Prohibition ended in December 1933, Bal Tabarin received an immediate renovation by Pflueger along with a liquor license from the state. Pflueger was then asked to design cocktail lounges for several hotels, completing the Cirque for the Fairmont Hotel in 1935, adorned with finely painted murals by Esther Bruton, and in 1939, both the Patent Leather Bar for the St. Francis Hotel and the Top of the Mark for the Mark Hopkins Hotel. The Patent Leather Bar used a metal-finned ceiling much like that which Pflueger had installed above the audience at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. A padded, serpentine bar snaked through the room's mirror, chrome and black leather decor. Ansel Adams was retained by C. Templeton Crocker {{to show off the}} new cocktail lounge in photographs.|$|E
