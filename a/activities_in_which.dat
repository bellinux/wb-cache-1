5|$|During the 1790s, {{politicians}} and land speculators in Georgia perpetrated fraudulent and corrupt land sales {{in an area}} that is now a large portion of Alabama and Mississippi. When the fraud was exposed in 1795, there was significant public outcry, and the Georgia legislation authorizing the sales was repealed. This led to a host of claims and litigation, since in a number of cases, land was afterward resold to unsuspecting third parties. President Jefferson eventually established a three-person commission to resolve conflicting claims arising from the fraud. Lincoln was appointed to this commission, which developed legislation to resolve the issue. Eventually approved by Congress, Georgia's claims to the area were extinguished and some land was reserved to resolve other outstanding claims. The commission was also responsible for documenting and reporting on {{the nature and extent of}} the fraud, <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Lincoln was heavily involved.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the {{characterisation}} of Shashthi {{underwent a}} gradual evolution. Aforementioned folk traditions originating between the 10th and 5th centuries BCE associated the goddess with {{both positive and}} negative elements of fertility, birth, motherhood and childhood. However, between the 4th century BCE and the 5th century CE, a shift occurred in which Shashthi was increasingly depicted as a malevolent deity associated with the sufferings of mothers and children. The fifth century text Kashyapa Samhita calls Shashthi by the epithet Jataharini ("one who steals the born") and provides a list of the malevolent <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Shashthi is believed to engage, including her practice of stealing foetuses from the womb and devouring children on the sixth day following birth. For this reason, the text recommends that she be propitiated through worship in her honour on this day in the lying-in room and on the sixth day of every fortnight thereafter.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} curriculum, {{there are no}} {{references}} to sports being played at Carre's before the 19th century. In 1835, the Marquis of Bristol allowed the school to use an acre of land, which probably functioned as a playground. Sports fields were not added to the grounds until 1908, but the earliest reports of the school participating in sporting events pre-date this by half a century. In the 1860s, the Sleaford Gazette reported on cricket matches with local schools, namely the rival academies run by Mr Boyer and Mr Dibben in Sleaford; by the 1890s, these matches were being organised with more distant schools, like the grammar school at Grantham. Athletics were practised at the school as early as 1871 when a sports day was held; the 100 yards and half a mile races, hurdles, the pole jump and throwing the cricket ball were <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> forms competed. Football was played at the school as early as 1895. Glebe land was acquired in 1908 for sporting purposes and levelled in the early 1930s. A cycling club was formed in the 1940s and badminton was informally organised by pupils by the 1950s; between 1957 and 1960, a portion of land was converted into tennis courts for the school and rugby {{was introduced in the}} 1966–67 academic year.|$|E

25|$|The {{differences}} between alternative views of economic freedom have been {{expressed in terms}} of Isaiah Berlin's distinction between positive freedom and negative freedom. Classical liberals favour a focus on negative freedom as did Berlin himself. By contrast Amartya Sen argues for an understanding of freedom in terms of capabilities to pursue a range of goals. One measure which attempts to assess freedom in the positive sense is Goodin, Rice, Parpo, and Eriksson's measure of discretionary time, which is an estimate of how much time people have at their disposal during which they are free to choose the <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they participate, after taking into account the time they need to spend acquiring the necessities of life. In his book, Capitalism and Freedom, Milton Friedman explains the preservation of freedom is the reason for limited and decentralized governments. It creates positive freedom within the society allowing for freedom of choice for an individual in a free society.|$|E

2500|$|The {{health risks}} with {{conventional}} earlobe piercing are common but {{tend to be}} minor, particularly if proper technique and hygienic procedures are followed. One study found that up to 35 percent of persons with pierced ears had one or more complications, including minor infection (77 percent of pierced ear sites with complications), allergic reaction (43 percent), keloids (2.5 percent), and traumatic tearing (2.5 percent). Pierced ears are a significant risk factor for contact allergies to the nickel in jewelry. [...] Earlobe tearing, during the healing period or after healing is complete, can be minimized by not wearing earrings, especially wire-based dangle earrings, during <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{they are likely to}} become snagged, such as while playing sports.

40|$|INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND Maintenance is {{the process}} that {{preserves}} or restores a desired state of a system or facility. The maintenance process includes three major activities: inspection, planned maintenance, and disturbance handling (where disturbances are unplanned system states). Inspection is the <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> information about state is monitored to allow prediction or early detection of disturbances. Planned maintenance is the <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> elements of the system are modified or replaced according to a pre-determined schedule, {{with the aim of}} avoiding or reducing the frequency of disturbances. Disturbance handling is the <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> elements of the system are modified or replaced to restore the desired state, following a disturbance. Maintenance is a task that has some important differences from tasks commonly selected for industrial robots. First, maintenance often requires access to environments that are more dynamic and less predictable than is the case fo...|$|R
