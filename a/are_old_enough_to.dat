5|$|The {{raising of}} school leaving age (shortened to ROSLA) {{is the name}} given by the {{government}} to refer to changes regarding the legal age a child is permitted to leave compulsory education as specified under an Education Act. In most countries, the school leaving age often reflects when young people are seen to be mature enough within their society, but not necessarily when they <b>are</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be regarded as an adult.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{cycle of}} the fisher lasts almost a year. Female fishers {{give birth to a}} litter of three or four kits in the spring. They nurse and care for their kits until late summer, when they <b>are</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> set out on their own. Females enter estrus shortly after giving birth and leave the den to find a mate. Implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until the following spring, when they give birth and the cycle is renewed.|$|E
5|$|After his return, Lad is bred {{with another}} prize-winning collie, Lady, {{and they have}} two male puppies which are named Little Lad and Wolf. Angela is allowed her choice of one as a present to her when they <b>are</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> leave their mother & she chooses Little Lad. However, Jackson White (Jack Daly), a poacher Lad fought and chased off the {{property}} before, sets fire to barn out of vengeance. Elizabeth is injured and Little Lad is killed but not Wolf. Lad later aids in capturing White when he breaks into the house to try to steal Lad's gold trophy from the dog show. Angela is initially inconsolable {{over the loss of}} her puppy Little Lad, and refuses {{to have anything to do}} with Wolf. After he is nearly lost in another accident, she changes her mind and accepts Wolf as her new dog.|$|E

5|$|The Catholic Church {{sees the}} sacrament of {{confirmation}} as required to complete the grace given in baptism. When adults are baptised, confirmation is normally given immediately afterwards, a practice followed even with newly baptised infants in the Eastern Catholic Churches. In the West confirmation of children is delayed until they <b>are</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> understand or at the bishop's discretion. In Western Christianity, particularly Catholicism, the sacrament is called confirmation, because it confirms and strengthens the grace of baptism; in the Eastern Churches, it is called chrismation, because the essential rite is the anointing of the person with chrism, a mixture of olive oil and some perfumed substance, usually balsam, blessed by a bishop. Those who receive confirmation must be {{in a state of}} grace, which for those who have reached the age of reason means that they should first be cleansed spiritually by {{the sacrament of}} Penance; they should also have the intention of receiving the sacrament, and be prepared to show in their lives that they are Christians.|$|E
5|$|Marta, a black gray wolf, is alpha {{female in}} a small pack in Pleasant Valley, Montana, that {{consists}} of her mate, Calef, their three pups Rann, Sula, and Annie, and a seven-year-old wolf named Oldtooth. One morning Calef is killed by poachers, leaving Marta and Oldtooth to try to feed and raise the pups on their own. Though an experienced hunter, Oldtooth is unable to bring down large game as he lost most of his teeth chewing a steel leg trap off his leg years ago. Once the cubs <b>are</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be left alone for short periods of time, Marta takes over {{the bulk of the}} hunting. Though it is difficult, the two adults successfully keep all three cubs alive and begin weaning them and teaching them the ways of the wolf. In the summer, traps begin appearing in the area as human populations increase. Annie and Sula are caught and are taken away by humans, but reappear a few days later, locked in cages. Marta tries to free her pups but is unsuccessful; however humans come regularly to keep them fed and ensure they have water. Oldtooth is later captured, while Marta is tranquilized from a helicopter. Rann escapes and is not seen again.|$|E
5|$|After a varying {{amount of}} {{training}} (at {{least a few}} months), apprentices are eventually made warriors. Another naming ceremony is held, this time to mark the cat as being a full member of the Clan. Warriors are given their own unique suffix that often marks their personality or appearance; for example, ‘Graystripe’ would be named after the grey stripe running down his back, ‘Brokentail’ after the kink in his tail, and ‘Sandstorm’ after her fiery personality. It is extremely rare for warriors to meet another cat with the exact same name, but often a warrior will meet another cat with the same first part of their name, and very often will a warrior meet another cat with the same last part of their name (such as fur, tail, or heart). Once named, warriors hold a vigil at night to protect the clan, {{while the rest of}} the clan is sleeping. After the vigil, warriors are free to move into the warrior’s den, where the majority of the Clan sleeps. The duty of a warrior is to protect and uphold their Clan at all costs. They are able to hunt by themselves, and are generally skilled at defending themselves in battle. Warriors can take a mate, and females can give birth to new kits; if this occurs, the expecting mother, known as a 'queen', will avoid warrior duties for six months before returning to them once her kits are made apprentices. The vast majority of warriors are also chosen to later be mentors to new apprentices. Warriors will remain in this position for the remainder of their life, or until they <b>are</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> retire.|$|E

25|$|Another form {{of salmon}} production, which is safer but less controllable, {{is to raise}} salmon in {{hatcheries}} until they <b>are</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> become independent. They are released into rivers {{in an attempt to}} increase the salmon population. This system is referred to as ranching. It was very common in countries such as Sweden, before the Norwegians developed salmon farming, but is seldom done by private companies. As anyone may catch the salmon when they return to spawn, a company is limited in benefiting financially from their investment.|$|E
500|$|Bald eagles {{are sexually}} mature at {{four or five}} years of age. When they <b>are</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> breed, they often return to the area where they were born. It is thought that bald eagles mate for life. However, if one member of a pair dies or disappears, the {{survivor}} will choose a new mate. A pair which has repeatedly failed in breeding attempts may split and look for new mates. Bald eagle courtship involves elaborate, spectacular calls and flight displays. The flight includes swoops, chases, and cartwheels, in which they fly high, lock talons, and free fall, separating just before hitting the ground. Usually, a territory defended by a mature pair will be [...] of waterside habitat.|$|E

They are then released into rivers, often {{in an attempt to}} increase the salmon population. This practice was very common in countries like Sweden before the Norwegians developed salmon farming, but is seldom done by private companies, as anyone may catch the salmon when they return to spawn, limiting a company's chances of benefiting financially from their investment. Because of this, the method has mainly been used by various public authorities and non profit groups like the Cook Inlet Aquaculture Association as a way of artificially increasing salmon populations in situations where they have declined due to overharvest, construction of dams, and habitat destruction or disruption. Unfortunately, there can be negative consequences to this sort of population manipulation, including genetic [...] "dilution" [...] of the wild stocks, and many jurisdictions are now beginning to discourage supplemental fish planting in favour of harvest controls and habitat improvement and protection. A variant method of fish stocking, called ocean ranching, is under development in Alaska. There, the young salmon are released into the ocean far from any wild salmon streams. When it is time for them to spawn, they return to where they were released where fishermen can then catch them.|$|E
2500|$|In India, {{the mating}} season occurs between mid-October and January, while captive dholes in the Moscow Zoo breed mostly in February. Unlike wolf packs, dhole clans may contain {{more than one}} {{breeding}} female. More than one female dhole may den and rear their litters {{together in the same}} den. During mating, the female assumes a crouched, cat-like position. There is no copulatory tie characteristic of other canids when the male dismounts. Instead, the pair lie on their sides facing each other in a semicircular formation. The gestation period lasts 60–63 days, with litter sizes averaging 4–6 pups. Their growth rate is much faster than that of wolves, being similar in rate to that of coyotes. Pups are suckled at least 58 days. During this time, the pack feeds the mother at the den site. Dholes do not use [...] sites to meet their pups as wolves do, though one or more adults will stay with the pups at the den {{while the rest of the}} pack hunts. Once weaning begins, the adults of the clan will regurgitate food for the pups until they <b>are</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> join in hunting. They remain at the den site 70–80 days. By the age of six months, pups accompany the adults on hunts, and will assist in killing large prey such as sambar by the age of eight months. Maximum longevity in captivity is 15–16 years.|$|E
