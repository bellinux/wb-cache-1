But teachers recognized his ability and encouraged his intellectual pursuits, and his rewarding experience with academic studies led him to believe that he could use his knowledge to empower African Americans. Du Bois graduated from the town's Searles High School. When Du Bois decided to attend college, the congregation of his childhood church, the First Congregational Church of Great Barrington, raised the money for his tuition.Horne, p. 7.Lewis, pp. 39–40.|$|E

Finally, the American asks: [...] "How many decades does it take an average Soviet man to earn enough money to buy a Soviet car?" [...] After a thoughtful pause, the Soviet replies: [...] "And you are lynching Negroes!" [...] The phrase garnered numerous iterations during the Cold War period. Its pervasiveness in Russian society reflected a strong sense of Soviet socialist patriotism.

A variant used during this time as a form of reciprocity when faced with criticism over imprisonment and treatment of Refuseniks, was to put the focus on race in the United States criminal justice system.

Advisor: Dr. Rebecca Ropers-Huilman. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 290 pages, appendices A-G. The growing cultural {{diversity in the}} United States confronts human service professions such as nursing with challenges to fundamental values of social justice and caring. Non-White individuals have experienced long-documented and persistent disparities in health outcomes and receipt of health care services when compared to whites. Medical evidence suggests that health care disparities experienced by non-Whites in the U. S. are perpetuated, in part, by bias, discrimination, and stereotyping by health care providers. National experts recommend cultural competence education to fix this problem. The cultural competence focus in nursing education programs has been criticized by some nursing scholars for essentializing culture and failing to examine the dynamics of race and racism in U. S. society. Yet, the call for an explicit focus on race and racism raises the question, "Are nursing faculty, of whom 93 % are White, prepared to teach students about race and racism?" This study investigated what White nursing faculty members who teach cultural nursing education think, believe, and teach <b>about</b> race, <b>racism,</b> and anti-racism. The study resulted in four conclusions that are of interest not only to nursing faculty who teach cultural topics, but to any nursing faculty who wish to prepare students to work for justice in a culturally and racially diverse society. First, {{the findings suggest that}} the Whiteness of the participants' personal and professional experiences and contexts obscured their understanding and teaching of race, racism, and anti-racism. Second, learning <b>about</b> race, <b>racism,</b> and anti-racism was best understood as a lifelong developmental process and warrants developmental learning goals. Third, teaching <b>about</b> race, <b>racism,</b> and anti-racism was most effective when grounded in relational, holistic pedagogies. Finally, the findings of the study suggest that the White faculty participants were not well prepared to teach <b>about</b> race, <b>racism,</b> and anti-racism, in most cases lacking the intention and academic knowledge to incorporate these topics into their culture courses. This study has implications for White nursing educators and administrators and offers recommendations to assist them in taking individual and systemic actions that may facilitate teaching and learning <b>about</b> race, <b>racism,</b> and anti-racism...|$|R
