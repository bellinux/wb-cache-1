40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} {{technical}} feasibility and clinical outcome of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) {{with and without}} stent placement for treatment of buttock claudication caused by internal iliac artery (IIA) stenosis. Methods: Between September 2001 and July 2011, thirty-four patients with buttock claudication underwent endovascular treatment. After angiographic lesion evaluation PTA with or without stent placement was performed. Technical success was recorded. Clinical outcome post-treatment was assessed at three months post-intervention and was classified as: 1) complete relief of symptoms, 2) <b>partial</b> <b>relief,</b> or 3) no relief of symptoms. Complications during follow-up were recorded. Results: Forty-four lesions in 34 symptomatic patients were treated with PTA. Eight lesions were treated with additional stent placement. Technical success was achieved in 40 / 44 lesions (91 %). Three procedure-related minor complications occurred, i. e. asymptomatic conservatively treated intimal dissections. After a median of 2. 9 months, patients experienced no relief of symptoms in 7 / 34 cases (21 %), <b>partial</b> <b>relief</b> in 14 / 34 cases (41 %), and complete relief in 13 / 34 cases (38 %). Six patients required a reintervention during follow-up. Conclusion: Endovascular treatment of IIA stenosis has a high technical success rate and a low complication rate.

40|$|AbstractNumerous {{theoretical}} {{problems have}} been simplified and, in many cases, unified via the theory of matrix generalized inversion, but not withstanding storage difficulties, occasionally, {{at the time of}} computer utilization.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present some computational aspects of matrix generalized inversion for computer manipulations which provide <b>partial</b> <b>relief</b> to such problems, along with a discussion of some applications, particularly in the area of statistical analyses. <b>Partial</b> <b>relief</b> may be had, for example, through the utilization of the matrix kronecker product and its associated properties, special storage processes such as those available in manipulations with sparse matrices, and schemes for computing the matrix generalized inverse of partitioned matrices.

40|$|Neuropathic pain {{is one of}} the key {{features}} of (classical) Fabry disease (FD). No randomized clinical trials comparing effectiveness of different pain management strategies have been performed. This review aims to give an overview of existing pain management strategies. PubMed and Embase were searched up to September 2014 for relevant articles on treatment of neuropathic pain in FD. Seven-hundred-thirty-one articles were identified of which 26 were included in the analysis. Studies reported on 55 individuals in total, with group-sizes ranging from 1 to 8. Carbamazepine appeared most beneficial: complete pain relief in 5 / 25, <b>partial</b> <b>relief</b> in 17 / 25, and no benefit in 3 / 25 patients. Phenytoin resulted in complete relief in 1 / 27, <b>partial</b> <b>relief</b> in 12 / 27 and no benefit in 6 / 27 patients. In 8 patients a significant reduction in the frequency of pain attacks was described. Gabapentin caused <b>partial</b> <b>relief</b> in 6 / 7 and no relief in 1 / 7 patients. Little evidence was reported for SSNRI's or treatment combinations. Adverse-effects were reported in all treatment strategies. Only for carbamazepine, phenytoin and gabapentin there is evidence of effectiveness in neuropathic pain due to FD, but comparison of effectiveness between these drugs is lacking. In routine clinical practice adverse-effects may discourage use of carbamazepine and phenytoin in favor of second-generation antiepileptic drugs, but this is currently not supported by clinical evidence. This review suffers greatly from incomplete outcome reports and a predominance of case reports, which emphasizes the need for robust clinical trials and observational cohort studie...|$|R

5000|$|This {{suggests}} that the desynchronization of the frequency range is movement related. A sensory trick, {{also known as a}} geste antagoniste, is a common characteristic present in focal dystonias, most prevalently in cervical dystonia, however it has also been found in patients with blepharospasm. [...] Sensory tricks offer only temporary and often <b>partial</b> <b>relief</b> of spasmodic torticollis. 74% of patients report only <b>partial</b> <b>relief</b> of spasmodic torticollis compared to 26% of complete relief of torticollis. The sensory trick must also be applied by the patient themselves. When the sensory trick is applied by an examiner, only 32% of patients report relief comparable to relief during self-application. Since {{the root of the problem}} is neurological, doctors have explored sensorimotor retraining activities to enable the brain to [...] "rewire" [...] itself and eliminate dystonic movements. The work of several doctors such as Nancy Byl and Joaquin Farias has shown that sensorimotor retraining activities and proprioceptive stimulation can induce neuroplasticity, making it possible for patients to recover substantial function that was lost due to Cervical Dystonia.|$|R
