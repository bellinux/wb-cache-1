The player competes at reproductions of the Royal Troon Golf Club and the Old Course at St. Andrews as and against famous golfers of the time.

5|$|Flight Unlimited is a {{three-dimensional}} (3D) flight simulator video game: its gameplay is <b>a</b> <b>simulation</b> of piloting real-world airplanes. Players may control the Bellanca Decathlon, Extra 300S, Pitts Special S-2B, Sukhoi Su-31 and Grob G103a Twin II sailplane. The game {{begins at the}} fixed-base operator (FBO) interface—a traversable 3D room whose contents represent menu options. For example, the player interacts with a row of scale airplane models to select an aircraft, and with a world globe to change airfield locations. Six settings are available, including Sedona, Arizona and Springfield, Vermont.|$|E
40|$|Developing <b>a</b> {{sequential}} <b>simulation</b> {{program is}} not an easy task. Developing <b>a</b> distributed <b>simulation</b> program is harder than a sequential one because it is necessary to deal with mapping physical processes into logical processes, communication and synchronization problems and learn another simulation language/library. In literature, several simulation environments can be found but the great number are for sequential simulation, not using all the advantages of a distributed/parallel platform. This paper presents ASDA, <b>an</b> automatic distributed <b>simulation</b> environment that aims at providing several possibilities to users developing <b>a</b> distributed <b>simulation.</b> The automatic word can be understood in three diferent ways: the environment automatically generates <b>a</b> distributed <b>simulation</b> program code; the environment can automatically choose one distributed simulation approach; and the environment can automatically convert <b>a</b> sequential <b>simulation</b> program into <b>a</b> distributed <b>simulation</b> program using the MRIP (Multipl...|$|R

5000|$|Simulations (or [...] "sims") {{which took}} place without {{interfacing}} to the Mission Control Center were called standalone simulations.
