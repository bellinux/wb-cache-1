500|$|From {{his early}} days, Auerbach was {{convinced}} that the fast break, where a team used a quick outlet pass to fast guards who run downcourt and score before the opponent had re-established position, was a potent tactical weapon. This new strategy proved lethal for the opposition. Further, Auerbach moved emphasis away from individual accolades and instilled the teamwork element into his players. He also invented the concept of the role player and of the sixth man, stating: [...] "Individual honors <b>are</b> <b>nice,</b> but no Celtic has ever gone {{out of his way to}} achieve them. We have never had the league's top scorer. In fact, we won seven league championships without placing even one among the league's top 10 scorers. Our pride was never rooted in statistics." ...|$|E

500|$|I'm writing {{short stories}} right now, that's what I do between novels, and I love them. I'm very devoted to it. You know, it's funny. There {{seems to be}} some sort of law that you only get to be celebrated for one or the other. And then a couple of people will break it. Updike did. They didn't review his story {{collections}} by saying, [...] "Well, these <b>are</b> <b>nice,</b> but he's a novelist." [...] Or review his novels by saying, [...] "Well, too bad he can't do the longer stuff." [...] Other people tend to get patronized on one end or the other—and I'll take it. I have a very happy life as a novelist. But the story collections I've published are tremendously important to me. And many of the uncollected stories—or yet-to-be-collected stories—are among my proudest writings. They're very closely allied, obviously, to novel writing. But also very distinct, and, you know, there's no need to choose.|$|E

The review also said [...] "R ballad [...] "Tie Me Down" [...] featuring smooth Auto-tuned vocals from Ray J, the B.A.S.S.-inspired [...] "Bunz", the slow jam [...] "New Girl," [...] and the rollicking [...] "Cashmere," [...] which bumps along like a New Jack rap jam, <b>are</b> <b>nice</b> diversions." [...] On the album split, The Los Angeles Times said, [...] "The album begins to lose circulation toward its end, when the pair lose their lambent wit in favor of mawkish lover-boy ballads better left to Sean Kingston albums." [...] Jeff Weiss of the newspaper used [...] "Tie Me Down" [...] as an example, noting that its sounds have [...] "a saccharine sappiness and contrived tone that feels {{at odds with the}} otherwise organic-sounding album." ...|$|E

Valo dated Finnish television host and model Jonna Nygrén in the early 2000s. The two became engaged in 2005, but broke-up in spring 2006. The couple reunited {{in the summer of}} 2006, but broke-up again in 2007. In 2009, Valo was briefly involved in a relationship with an undisclosed partner, which served as the main inspiration for HIM's 2010 album [...] In March 2012, Valo was linked to Parisian model Sandra Mittica. In April 2015, the couple were reported to have broken-up. Since September 2016, Valo has been linked to Finnish model Christel Karhu. Valo is also a vegetarian and non-religious. In 2004, Kerrang!-magazine named Valo the biggest sex symbol in the world, and in 2011, Valo was voted the [...] "Hottest Dude In Hard Rock And Metal" [...] by the readers of Revolver-magazine.

500|$|The {{concept for}} using an {{underwater}} theme park as the game's setting {{came from a}} conversation Uchikoshi had with a friend, who mentioned it being nice to be in Disneyland parks when it is raining, as very few people are there then, making it feel like the park is reserved to oneself. Uchikoshi agreed that empty theme parks <b>are</b> <b>nice,</b> and considered setting the game in an empty theme park on land, but moved it underwater after realizing that the characters could escape by climbing the fence and that some further obstacle was needed. This setting, described by Uchikoshi as [...] "you're trapped somewhere and trying to escape", was made to embody two of humanity's instinctive desires: the unconscious desire {{to return to the}} safety of one's mother's womb and shut oneself away from the world, and the desire to escape from and overcome one's current condition. German elements were used a lot in the game's setting, including German terminology. This was decided on for multiple reasons: the developers thought that English was [...] "too ordinary", and when they decided to use the pharmaceutical company Leiblich in the story, they also thought that Germany and Switzerland were known for pharmaceuticals. Additionally, Uchikoshi had visited Germany and was influenced by the 1999 animated film , and how the friend he had the theme park conversation with spoke German. Each of the game's heroines were assigned a related attraction in the park, where their [...] "impactful events" [...] would occur. The one exception was Coco, as [...] "her speech and conduct was already as delightful as an attraction".|$|E
500|$|Weezer {{received}} generally favorable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns {{a rating}} out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73 out of 100. AllMusic senior writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{who gave the}} album a [...] rating of {{four and a half}} stars, stated that [...] "this may seem like nothing special -- it's just punk-pop, delivered without much dynamic range but with a whole lot of hooks -- but nobody else does it this [...] so well, no matter how many bands try." [...] PopMatters' writer Jason Thompson also gave the album a positive review, praising the decision of the band to have Ric Ocasek produce them again: [...] "The guitar solos ring out as joyful as the words. And even the songs' lengths <b>are</b> <b>nice</b> and compact. Weezer comes in, plays the song, and exits. No overkill makes for many moments where you want to hear these songs again and again. Perhaps having producer Ric Ocasek back on board {{was one of the best}} ideas the band had, as the Green Album is certainly water tight all around." [...] Drowned in Sound gave the album a very positive review, saying [...] "After creating the two greatest pop-rock records in existence it's time to add a third. One listen to the Green Album has you eating out of Rivers Cuomo's hand just like in the past. [...] Rivers Cuomo is one of the greatest song-writers that has picked up a guitar. Anyone who can with hold the charms of the Geek-rock quartet are obviously made of stone and complete assholes. Sorry to be blunt but it's the way it is. God I think the sun's finally taking its toll." [...] The album would later rank at number 3 in their list of the best albums of 2001, tying with System of a Down's Toxicity and Mogwai's Rock Action. Q listed Weezer as one of the best 50 albums of 2001.|$|E
500|$|NPR writer Linda Holmes {{challenged}} the show's assertions of female empowerment. Finding the episode itself [...] "silly {{and full of}} bad dialogue" [...] and [...] "cheesy more than offensive", Holmes questioned how a series about women whose conduct and appearance were micromanaged could simultaneously claim that those regimented women were uniformly empowered by the experience. She opined that [...] "you can shake a Bunny tail and be empowered, no argument. It depends on what's {{going on in the}} rest of your life. But shaking a Bunny tail isn't enough to demonstrate empowerment if {{you have to go to}} Eddie Cibrian or Hugh Hefner for help every time you have a problem, and having the right not to be slapped on the behind when you deliver a cocktail isn't exactly a societal advance on the order of universal suffrage." [...] The series, she concluded, might have been better served had those involved positioned it as a camp soap opera and not tried to make a feminist statement. In concurrence, Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker criticized Hefner's narration, deeming it as delusional and stupid, and criticize the series for its stance on feminism. She wrote, [...] "The show wants things both ways: to glamorize the Playboy 'lifestyle' from a male point of view and also to try to persuade us that, although Bunnydom had its hardships and rigors—no gum chewing, constant smiling—wearing an uncomfortable skimpy uniform and putting a poufy fake tail on your butt meant you held the keys to the universe." [...] Television Blend's Kelly West was much more optimistic about the episode, and asserted that [...] "The Playboy Club offers a lot of shiny things to look at, but beyond that, there is a story beginning to develop and characters that, while not quite as original as they <b>are</b> <b>nice</b> to look at, are interesting and charismatic enough to carry the series." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said the Playboy brand and the lifestyle portrayed in the series was dated and uninterestingm calling it a [...] "bad show, period. The writing was weak, the acting spotty and the sexism too ridiculous and obvious to comment on more than once." [...] Alan Pergament, former critic for The Buffalo News, said of the show that [...] "the truth is [...] should have been a pay-cable series because without the sex it is pretty boring and tame." ...|$|E

Grdan however fails in his plan because of the interference of god Lero who causes shakes and thunder and shades flames on the fire just before the wedding ceremony. At the moment in which Miljenko enters the church, shakes and thunder cease, and the fire flares up again which is interpreted as Lero's sign that Miljenko, and not Grdan, should become Dubravka's husband.|$|E
2500|$|While Canadians may dismiss {{comments}} {{that they do}} not find appealing or stereotypes that are patently ridiculous, Andrew Cohen believes that there is a value to considering what foreigners have to say: [...] "Looking at Canadians through the eyes of foreigners, we {{get a sense of how}} they see us.

2500|$|According to Charles Ebel, {{writing in}} the 1960s, [...] "Massalia was not an {{isolated}} Greek city, but had developed an Empire of its own {{along the coast of}} southern Gaul by the fourth century". But the idea of a Massalian [...] "empire" [...] is no longer credible in the light of recent archaeological evidence, which shows that Massalia never even had a very large chora (agricultural territory under its direct control). However further archaeological evidence since shows Massalia had over twelve cities in its network in France, Spain, Monaco and Corsica. Cities Massalia founded that still exist today <b>are</b> <b>Nice,</b> Antibes, Monaco, Le Brusc, Agde, and Aleria. There is evidence of direct rule of at least two of their cities with a flexible system of autonomy as suggested by Emporion and Rhodus' own coin minting. Massalia's empire was {{not the same as the}} monolithic of the ancient world or of the nineteenth century being a scattered group of cities connected by the sea and rivers. The Delian League was also a scattered group of cities spread far across the sea and became known as the Athenian Empire.|$|E
