5|$|Adolf Hitler {{was furious}} that the British {{had been able}} to sail a {{flotilla}} of ships up the Loire unhindered. His immediate reaction was to dismiss Generaloberst Carl Hilpert, chief-of-staff to the Commander in Chief West. The raid refocused German <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Wall, and special attention was given to ports to prevent any repeat of the raid. By June 1942, the Germans began using concrete to fortify gun emplacements and bunkers in quantities previously only used in U-boat pens. Hitler laid out new plans in a meeting with Armaments Minister Albert Speer in August 1942, calling for the construction of 15,000 bunkers by May 1943 to defend the Atlantic coast from Norway to Spain.|$|E
5|$|Although Minton {{was on the}} Supreme Court, he {{remained}} casually involved in Democratic internal politics. He wrote Truman several letters criticizing Justices Robert H. Jackson and Hugo Black, referring to Black as a demagogue. He also offered advice on dealing with Republican opposition in the Senate. In a 1954 letter, after Truman left office, he urged Truman to help focus public <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> economy and away from communism, a threat he claimed the Republicans were exaggerating to avoid confronting their own problems.|$|E
5|$|Although Sandra Panem in {{the journal}} Science praised Shilts' efforts and the {{attention}} the book brought to AIDS, she criticized his simplistic interpretation of science and the ways research is fostered and accomplished in the U.S. Panem furthermore believes Shilts gives appropriate weight {{to the issue of}} homophobia hampering <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> disease, but remarks that even if AIDS had struck a more socially acceptable group of people, similar delays and confusion would have slowed medical progress.|$|E
50|$|At this time, Mere Marie Alvequin, {{superior}} of the Dames Augustines de St. Magloire, petitioned Olier directly, {{and through}} others {{to undertake the}} responsibility of spiritual director of the monastery, but Olier preferred to focus his <b>attentions</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> parish and seminary of St. Sulpice.|$|R

5|$|Critics of {{the planned}} exhibit, {{especially}} those of the American Legion and the Air Force Association, charged that the exhibit focused too much <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Japanese casualties inflicted by the nuclear bomb, {{rather than on the}} motivations for the bombing or the discussion of the bomb's role in ending the conflict with Japan. The exhibit brought to national attention many long-standing academic and political issues related to retrospective views of the bombings. As a result, after various failed attempts to revise the exhibit {{in order to meet the}} satisfaction of competing interest groups, the exhibit was canceled on 30 January 1995. Martin O. Harwit, Director of the National Air and Space Museum, was compelled to resign over the controversy.|$|E
5|$|During {{an episode}} of Raw after SummerSlam, Goldberg {{challenged}} Triple H to another match for the World Heavyweight Championship. This match {{took place at the}} Unforgiven pay-per-view on September 21, 2003 with a stipulation that, should he lose, Goldberg would retire from WWE. Goldberg defeated Triple H to become the new champion. After SummerSlam, Kurt Angle focused his <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Undertaker, whom he wrestled in a match for the WWE Championship during {{an episode of}} SmackDown! on September 4, 2003. During the match, Lesnar attacked both wrestlers with a folding chair, leading to an Iron Man match between Angle and Lesnar. Lesnar won five falls during the match, while Angle won four, and as a result Lesnar won the title.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Roosevelt {{backed the}} Hepburn Bill, {{imposing}} railroad regulation. Many Republicans initially {{wanted nothing to}} do with the bill, and Senate Republican leader Nelson Aldrich entrusted management of the bill to Tillman. Aldrich hoped the outspoken South Carolinian would cause the defeat of the bill. To Aldrich's surprise, Tillman soberly and competently conducted the bill through much of the legislative process. Tillman withdrew from the bill (though he voted for it) after Roosevelt got a provision for federal court review of agency decisions included, which Tillman opposed. The president and the southern senator ended on worse terms than before, but there was great public <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Hepburn Bill, and Tillman gained considerable respect for his role.|$|E

5|$|In 610, {{during the}} Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, Heraclius became the emperor of the Byzantine Empire after overthrowing Phocas. While Heraclius focused his <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{internal}} affairs of his empire, the Sassanid Persians conquered Mesopotamia, overran Syria in 611, and entered Anatolia to occupy Caesarea Mazaca. In 612, Heraclius expelled the Persians from Anatolia. In 613, he launched a counter offensive against Syria, but was decisively defeated.|$|E

Wolf comes to love and respect his father and soon forgets his mother, though Lad continues to search for her daily. A month later, Wolf falls through the ice of the semi-frozen lake, and Lad nearly drowns while saving him. When Lad staggers to shore, he is ecstatically greeted by the recovered Lady.|$|E

5|$|The 11th Army gained ground during mid-June, {{focusing}} their <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> northern {{approaches to}} the city. Casualties were high on both sides as the month dragged on. Aware {{of the need to}} act before the German summer offensive of 1942 reduced the availability of reinforcements and supplies, Manstein ordered a surprise attack using amphibious landings across Severnaya Bay on 29 June. The operation was a success; Soviet resistance crumbled. On 1 July German forces entered the city while the Soviet forces conducted a disorganised evacuation, and Hitler promoted Manstein to Generalfeldmarschall the same day. The entire city was in German hands by 4 July.|$|E
5|$|The Dravidar Kazhagam {{came to be}} {{well known}} among the urban {{communities}} and students. Villages were influenced by its message. Hindi, and ceremonies that had become associated with Brahmanical priesthood, were identified as alien symbols that should be eliminated from Tamil culture. Brahmins, who were regarded as the guardians of such symbols, came under verbal attack. From 1949 onwards, the Dravidar Kazhagam intensified social reformist work and put forward the fact that superstitions were the cause for the degeneration of Dravidians. The Dravidar Kazhagam vehemently fought for the abolition of untouchability amongst the Dalits. It also focused its <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> liberation of women, women's education, willing marriage, widow marriage, orphanages and mercy homes.|$|E
5|$|The Trait du Nord is an {{endangered}} breed; the Haras de Compiègne (Compiegne Stud), a national stud in France, {{had a major}} influence in saving the breed, until it was closed in October 2009. The national breed registry for the Trait du Nord is supported by other local initiatives. However, breed numbers were already low when these initiatives began to be implemented, and media <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Trait du Nord is insufficient to maintain economically viable interest. The breed is bred mainly by enthusiasts returning to family farms, but even the number of farms has been decreasing as many young farmers prefer more to breed cattle, which are more lucrative.|$|E

5|$|The book is an {{extensive}} work of investigative journalism, {{written in the}} form of an encompassing time line; the events that shaped the epidemic are presented as sequential matter-of-fact summaries. Shilts describes the impact and the politics involved in battling the disease on particular individuals in the gay, medical, and political communities. Shilts begins his discussion in 1977 with the first confirmed case of AIDS, that of Grethe Rask, a Danish doctor working in Africa. He ends with the announcement by actor Rock Hudson in 1985 that he was dying of AIDS, when international <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> disease exploded.|$|E

The province and the National Fire Protection Association denounced the cuts. The Canadian Centre for Emergency Preparedness suggested that such cuts would necessitate Canada asking for assistance from the United States in similar situations. Also cancelled by the Conservative federal government was the Canadian Emergency Management College, established in 1954 to train first responders. A spokesperson for Public Safety Minister Vic Toews deflected criticism of the cuts, noting that 90 per cent of emergencies are managed municipally or provincially.|$|E

In response to anti-German sentiments and public protests in Egypt and other countries, the German government issued a statement of condolence nine days after the incident.
