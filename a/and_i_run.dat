500|$|Johnson {{introduced}} a fast-paced style of basketball called [...] "Showtime", {{described as a}} mix of [...] "no-look passes off the fastbreak, pin-point alley-oops from halfcourt, spinning feeds and overhand bullets under the basket through triple teams." [...] Fellow Lakers guard Michael Cooper said, [...] "There {{have been times when}} [...] has thrown passes and I wasn't sure where he was going. Then one of our guys catches the ball and scores, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> back up the floor convinced that he must've thrown it through somebody." [...] Johnson could dominate a game without scoring, running the offense and distributing the ball with flair. In the 1982 NBA Finals, he was named the Finals MVP averaging just 16.2 points, the lowest average of any Finals MVP award recipient in the three-point shot era.|$|E
500|$|..... And when Michel {{gets his}} strokes of genius and, {{in the video}} for [...] "Army of Me", wants a dentist that's a gorilla to find a diamond in my mouth, some people call it nonsense. But it's {{probably}} the most realistic way of expressing what situation I'm in - all these people trying to take things away from me, and the gorilla finding a diamond that I don't know I have and then stealing it. [...] "Army of Me" [...] is so much about me actually learning that I have to defend myself. I {{have to stand up}} and fight the fucking gorilla. Once I've got the diamond <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> away with it, it becomes massive 'cos it's mine. But if the gorilla had kept it, it would have gone really tiny. That's surrealism for me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ratler <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> {{very much}} in the same groove," [...] said Barrington, [...] "but I fancy there is some little {{difference}} in the motive power." ...|$|E
60|$|Heavens, how <b>I</b> <b>ran!</b> The wind buffeted my {{face and}} buzzed in my nostrils. The rain pringled upon my skin and hissed past my ears. I {{stumbled}} into holes. I tripped over bushes. I fell among brambles. <b>I</b> was torn <b>and</b> breathless and bleeding. My tongue was like leather, my feet like lead, and my heart beating like a kettle-drum. Still <b>I</b> <b>ran,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> to {{the door}} {{in time to see}} Jim Hawkins, safe and sound, come {{climbing}} over the stockade.|$|R
60|$|A plank was {{thrust out}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> across it, fear {{gripping}} at my heart. Resting against the mast sat Ragnar, dying.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! But {{the place}} itself--the bareness--and the glitter {{and the salt}} smells, and the wind blowing the sand! The Men run after me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>run....</b> I know what's coming too. One of them touches me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Stobell {{brought up}} {{in front of him and}} frowned thoughtfully. [...] "I suppose you’re right," [...] he said, slowly; [...] "but if we ever get off this chicken-perch, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> across him, let him look out, that’s all." ...|$|E
60|$|I do {{not know}} why the sight of myself should alarm me so, but I rush from the house in terror, and the faces follow me; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> faster and faster, but I know that I shall never leave them behind me.|$|E
60|$|Soon I heard Euphemia's voice, calling loud. She {{seemed to}} be about the centre of the island, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> toward her.|$|R
60|$|We assented, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> to the camels {{that lay}} resting {{just outside the}} arch. Before I reached them, however, Quick called me back.|$|R
6000|$|... "The men hesitated, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> {{past them}} <b>and</b> {{climbed into the}} cart, and threw myself down by Mysa, and then they drove off." ...|$|R
60|$|I struck New York about noon one day, {{and took}} a walk up Broadway. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> against Silver himself, all {{encompassed}} up in a spacious kind of haberdashery, leaning against a hotel and rubbing the half-moons on his nails with a silk handkerchief.|$|E
6000|$|She {{laughed at}} the compliment. [...] "Come right in, sir," [...] she said. [...] "I'm Miss Ettie Shafter, Mr. Shafter's daughter. My mother's dead, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> the house. You can sit down by the stove {{in the front room}} until father comes along--Ah, here he is! So you can fix things with him right away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A-w-w," [...] the man sighed, {{his face}} {{clearing}} and infinite comprehension sounding in his voice. [...] "I have no moccasins. I t'ink pretty damn cold." [...] His satisfied expression changed to naive surprise when an outburst of laughter greeted his statement, {{but he went}} on stolidly. [...] "One more shot I hear, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> down the trail." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> waded deep <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> fast, <b>I</b> was as lean as a lugger's mast, I was as brown as a fisher's creel, <b>And</b> <b>I</b> {{liked my}} life unco weel.|$|R
6000|$|... "Suddenly {{a thought}} struck me. I seized more tightly {{the end of}} the rope, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran.</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> to the river. I plunged, I bounded, I made such great haste that {{sometimes}} I stumbled over obstacles, and sometimes the balloon seemed to lift me from the ground; but on, on I went, on to the river! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have not}} much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be happy than dignified; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> after him--he {{stood at the}} foot of the stairs.|$|R
6000|$|The {{unsatisfactory}} chauffeur reappeared. In a panic Father urged, [...] "Say, my name's Appleby <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> the tea-room at Grimsby Head--you know, {{couple of}} miles {{this side of the}} Center. It would be pretty nice for our class of business if the Madam was to stop there some time, and I was just wondering, just kinda wondering, if some time when she felt thirsty you c--" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{passed his}} hand over his face before he {{answered}} her. [...] "Because she <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> in different grooves now, and are not such meet playfellows as we used to be once. Do you remember my taking you away right through Saulsby Wood once on the old pony, and not bringing you back till tea-time, and Miss Blink going and telling my father?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do we know him!" [...] cried Leroy. [...] "Sure and didn't he <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> away {{together}} from the rebels, and Boxer, here, helping {{us to get}} out of the prison caves. Yes, yes, I know Larry well." [...] And then Leroy told of the escape from the caves, and of how all three of the party had become lost in the swamp lands.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are mad," [...] I said; [...] "let the cub go!" [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> towards Umslopogaas {{to take it}} from him. But he sprang {{aside and}} avoided me.|$|R
6000|$|Gertie (flushing): [...] "Oh, I didn't mean----But we {{did have}} some good times. Oh, Carl, will you ever forget the time you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> away when we were just babies?" ...|$|R
60|$|The doctor <b>and</b> Gray <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> {{full speed}} for shelter. The {{survivors}} {{would soon be}} back where they had left their muskets, and at any moment the fire might recommence.|$|R
6000|$|Peter laughed, {{thinking}} what an odd couple they would make. [...] "Hear the rest, then talk," [...] he said. [...] "See now! On Saturday next Mistress Margaret and I {{are to be}} married in the cathedral; then, towards sunset, the Marquis of Morella <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> our course in the great bull-ring yonder, and you {{and half a dozen}} of your men will be present. Now, I may conquer or I may fail----" ...|$|E
6000|$|But there warn't no answer, {{and nobody}} {{come out of}} the wigwam. Jim was gone! I set up a shout--and then another--and then another one; and run this way and that in the woods, {{whooping}} and screeching; but it warn't no use--old Jim was gone. Then I set down and cried; I couldn't help it. But I couldn't set still long. Pretty soon I went out on the road, trying to think what I better do, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> across a boy walking, and asked him if he'd seen a strange nigger dressed so and so, and he says: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Y' see, my {{division}} ends at Warsaw, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> {{back and}} forth here every other day, but I don't get much chance to see them, and I ain't worth a cuss f'r letter-writin'. Y' see, she's only aunt by marriage, but I like her; an' I guess she's got about all she can stand up under, an' so I like t' help her a little when I can. The old man died owning nothing but the house, an' that left the old lady t' rustle f'r her livin'. Dummed if she ain't sandy as old Sand. They're gitt'n' along purty--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Yes,' he answered; 'I 'eard the old gentleman say [...] "'Ome" [...] to the coachman, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> {{after the}} {{carriage}} {{all the way}} to 'Arley Street. Trevior's 'er name, Hedith Trevior.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, mother," [...] {{cried the}} bear, [...] "I dreamed of that big Bird I {{saw on the}} roof, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> down-stairs before <b>I</b> was 'arf awake, I was that horful frightened." ...|$|R
60|$|Sennit <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> to the lee main-rigging, {{where we}} just {{got a glimpse of}} the hat of the poor fellow, who seemed to be {{swimming}} manfully, as the ship foamed past him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not much, lad. I bring over {{a regular}} cargo, and the kegs are stowed away under {{the floor of}} the cabin, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> them at Pin-mill--that is the place we {{anchored}} the night before we got to Ipswich. I have been overhauled a good many times, but the cargo always looks right, and after searching it for a bit, they conclude it is all regular. You see, I don't bring over a great quantity--fifteen or twenty kegs is as much as I can stow away--and it is a long way safer being content with a small profit than trying to make a big one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Den I knew dat dat was {{no place}} for Sam, so I take my hoe <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> away as fast as I could. No one try to stop me. De oder niggers dance and sing when dey saw de oberseer fall dead. I ran all dat day up among de hills, {{skirting}} round de different plantations till I get quite into de wild part. Wheneber I came to stream I walk a long way in him till I get to tree hanging ober. Den pull myself up into de branches, climb along and drop at de farthest end, and den run again, for I knew dat dey would set de bloodhounds after me.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not care}} {{to go out of}} sight of the boat, fearing the coming of canoes with savages down the river: but the boy seeing a low place about a mile up the country, rambled to it; and by and by I saw him come running towards me. I thought he was pursued by some savage, or frighted with some wild beast, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> forward towards him to help him, but when I came nearer to him, I saw {{something}} hanging over his shoulders, which was a creature that he had shot, like a hare, but different in colour, and longer legs; however, we were very glad of it, and it was very good meat; but the great joy that poor Xury came with, was to tell me he had found good water, and seen no wild mans.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Harrington," [...] {{she said}} breathlessly, [...] "that pet pig of Bobbles' {{is in your}} garden again. He only got in this minute. I saw him coming <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> right after him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've a great mind not {{to shake}} hands with you at all. You passed me just now on the piazza without speaking; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> after you, as I suppose many another poor woman has done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Steele <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> out. There was {{shooting}} everywhere. Morton's crowd {{appeared to be}} in pursuit of rustlers in all directions. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> with Steele, <b>and</b> did not observe his condition until suddenly he fell right down in the street. Then he looked so white <b>and</b> so bloody <b>I</b> thought he'd stopped another bullet and--" ...|$|R
