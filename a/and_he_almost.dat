She died in hospital on 23July; somewhat typically, Reggie, having been recalled from Ireland, was not present when she died.

Manning had long predicted that the frequently tardy Reggie would be late for her funeral, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>almost</b> was. In addition, his mourning period, characterised by abrupt transitions from weeping to almost hysterical mirth, was precisely how Manning had imagined Guy Pringle's reaction to Harriet's supposed death in The Sum of Things. Manning was cremated and her ashes buried at Billingham Manor on the Isle of Wight.|$|E

500|$|When Lester {{is caught}} masturbating by Carolyn, his angry retort about {{their lack of}} {{intimacy}} {{is the first time}} he says aloud what he thinks about her. By confronting the issue and Carolyn's [...] "superficial investments in others", Lester is trying to [...] "regain a voice in a home that [...] the voices of mother and daughter". His final turning point comes when [...] Angela <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>almost</b> have sex; after she confesses her virginity, he no longer thinks of her as a sex object, but as a daughter. He holds her close and [...] "wraps her up". Mendes called it [...] "the most satisfying end to [...] journey there could possibly have been". With these final scenes, Mendes intended to show Lester at the conclusion of a [...] "mythical quest". After Lester gets a beer from the refrigerator, the camera pushes toward him, then stops facing a hallway down which he walks [...] "to meet his fate". Having begun to act his age again, Lester achieves closure. As he smiles at a family photo, the camera pans slowly from Lester to the kitchen wall, onto which blood spatters as a gunshot rings out; the slow pan reflects the peace of Lester's death. His body is discovered by Jane and Ricky. Mendes said that Ricky's staring into Lester's dead eyes is [...] "the culmination of the theme" [...] of the film: that beauty is found where it is least expected.|$|E

2500|$|Giovanni is {{an elderly}} Italian master stonemason, who discovers a thirteen-year-old Erik {{on one of}} his sites one morning, and takes him on as an apprentice.

Erik flourishes underneath Giovanni's care, and though a darkness was growing in the boy, the Italian helped to quell it for some time. Their rapport was interrupted by the return of Giovanni's youngest daughter, Luciana. Giovanni was the only father that Erik had ever known, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>almost</b> hero-worshiped the man. For the rest of his life, Erik would refer to no other man as [...] "sir," [...] due to the trust that was eventually lost between them.|$|E

At about 30 seconds into the round he hit Liston with several combinations, causing a bruise under Liston's right eye and a cut under his left, which {{eventually}} required eight stitches to close. It was the first time in his career that Liston had been cut. At one point in this attack, Liston's knees buckled <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>almost</b> went down as he was driven to the ropes. A clearly angered Liston rallied at the end of the round, as Ali seemed tired, and delivered punishing shots to Ali's body. It was probably Liston's best moment in the entire fight.

2500|$|Another {{colorful}} All-Star Game moment proceeded in the 1997 edition involving former Expos teammate Larry Walker, at {{that point}} with the Colorado Rockies.

[...] In the All-Star Game, Walker batted against Johnson, who theatrically threw over his head. [...] Ever adaptable, Walker placed his batting helmet backwards and switched sides in the batters' box to stand right-handed for one pitch. [...] He ended the at bat by drawing a walk. [...] The incident momentarily drew mirth and laughter from players in both dugouts, fans and announcers, and, of course, comparisons to the at bat with Kruk in the 1993 All-Star Game. [...] In spite of garnering a reputation of avoiding Johnson, Walker batted [...]393 (11 hits in 28 at bats) against him in his career, nearly double the rate of all left-handed batters at [...]199.|$|E

Ultimately Grohl declined and instead entered Robert Lang Studios in October 1994 to record fifteen of the forty songs he had written. With the exception of a guitar part on [...] "X-Static", played by Greg Dulli of the Afghan Whigs, Dave Grohl played every instrument and sang every vocal on the tracks. [...] "I was supposed to just join another band and be a drummer the rest of my life," [...] Grohl later said. [...] "I thought that I would rather do what no one expected me to do.

2500|$|He {{accompanied}} {{his father}} on his Italian campaign of 1174-76 against the Lombard League, whereby he was educated by Godfrey of Viterbo and associated with minnesingers like Friedrich von Hausen, Bligger von Steinach, and Bernger von Horheim. Henry was fluent in Latin and, according to the chronicler Alberic of Trois-Fontaines, was [...] "distinguished by gifts of knowledge, wreathed in flowers of eloquence, and learned in canon and Roman law". He was a patron of poets and poetry, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>almost</b> certainly composed the song Kaiser Heinrich, now among the Weingarten Song Manuscripts. According to his rank and with Imperial Eagle (Reichsadler), regalia, and a scroll, {{he is the first}} and foremost to be portrayed in the famous Codex Manesse, a 14th-century songbook manuscript featuring 140 reputed poets; at least three poems are attributed to a young and romantically minded Henry VI. In one of those he describes a romance that makes him forget all his earthly power, and neither riches nor royal dignity can outweigh his yearning for that lady (ê ich mich ir verzige, ich verzige mich ê der krône – before I give her up, I’d rather give up the crown).|$|E
2500|$|... 1877 saw Lucas make {{a further}} advance, being in average behind only the {{incomparable}} WG Grace and achieving his highest first class aggregagte {{for a season}} of 832 runs. He also showed himself a useful slow bowler, taking 34 wickets for less than fourteen each, and as late as 1882 achieved his best first-class bowling of six wickets for ten runs against his old University for the “Gentlemen of England” – ironically Lucas also achieved his highest first-class score of 145 in the same match! However, opinions as {{to the quality of}} Lucas’ bowling were not positive even then <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>almost</b> never bowled after 1882. Still, Lucas’ batting in the middle to late 1870s was good enough for him to be a regular for the Gentlemen from 1876 and to play for “England” teams against a combined Kent and Gloucestershire team in 1876 and against Gloucestershire alone the following year. Business prevented Lucas touring Australia with the first Test-playing team in 1876/1877, but despite being rather disappointing in his last year at Cambridge Lucas made his only tour in 1878/1879 under Lord Harris, when he did much more bowling than he would ordinarily have done owing to the absence of any specialist bowler except Tom Emmett.|$|E
