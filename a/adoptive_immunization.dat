In this study, we investigated the use of bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) pulsed ex vivo with rCPAF+CpG in an <b>adoptive</b> subcutaneous <b>immunization</b> for the ability to induce protective immunity against genital chlamydial infection. We found that BMDCs pulsed with rCPAF+CpG efficiently up-regulated the expression of activation markers CD 86, CD 80, CD 40 and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II), and secreted interleukin- 12, but not IL- 10 and IL- 4. Mice adoptively immunized with rCPAF+CpG-pulsed BMDCs or UV-EB+CpG-pulsed BMDCs produced elevated levels of antigen-specific IFN- and enhanced IgG 1 and IgG 2 a antibodies. Moreover, mice immunized with rCPAF+CpG-pulsed BMDCs or UV-EB+CpG-pulsed BMDCs exhibited significantly reduced genital Chlamydia shedding, accelerated resolution of infection, and reduced oviduct pathology when compared to infected mock-immunized animals.

40|$|Immunization {{with heat}} shock {{proteins}} has protective effects in models of induced arthritis. Analysis {{has shown a}} reduced synovial inflammation in such protected animals. <b>Adoptive</b> transfer and <b>immunization</b> with selected T cell epitopes (synthetic peptides) have indicated the protection to be mediated by T cells directed to conserved hsp epitopes. This was shown first for mycobacterial hsp 60 and later for mycobacterial hsp 70. Fine specificity analysis showed that such T cells were cross-reactive with the homologous self hsp. Therefore protection by microbial hsp reactive T cells can be by cross-recognition of self hsp overexpressed in the inflamed tissue. Preimmunization with hsp leads to a relative expansion of such self hsp cross-responsive T cells. The regulatory nature of such T cells may originate from mucosal tolerance maintained by commensal flora derived hsp or from partial activation through recognition of self hsp as a partial agonist (Altered Peptide Ligand) or {{in the absence of}} proper costimulation. Recently, we reported the selective upregulation of B 7. 2 on microbial hsp 60 specific T cells in response to self hsp 60.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} different immunotherapeutic {{strategies that}} can be used for the treatment of cancer in general, and of melanoma in particular. Tumor-specific T cell responses can be induced via either active or passive immunization. Active immunization can be used to target tumors for which high affinity T cells are present within the endogenous repertoire. This thesis describes a vaccination method where a tattoo device is used to deliver a DNA vaccine into the skin. The vaccine-induced anti-tumor effect can be further enhanced by combining vaccination with host conditioning and <b>adoptive</b> transfer. Passive <b>immunization</b> via TCR gene transfer is the preferred strategy when targeting tumor self antigens, because this can circumvent limitations of the endogenous T cell repertoire and does not require extensive in vitro culture. This thesis describes several factors that can improve the anti-tumor ac tivity of TCR modified cells. In addition, we describe a procedure for the selection of a human TCR that is well expressed and highly affine, and that is therefore likely to enable more efficient targeting of human melanoma. Implementation of these factors in the design of clinical trials is likely to positively affect the clinical efficacy of TCR gene therapy. Promotor: T. N. M. Schumacher, Co-promotor: J. B. A. G.

It was found that resistance developed 2 weeks after infection and that protection could be passively transferred to normal recipients with short-lived T lymphocytes. Although cells taken from animals at progressive stages of the disease were consistently able to adoptively immunize normal recipients their effectiveness waned from 8 weeks onward. Concomitant serum transfer performed at progressive times during the infection failed to augment the level of immunity generated in normal recipients, and at certain times appeared to have an inhibitory effect on this phenomenon. Serum from convalescent animals however did augment the level of adoptive immunity expressed in recipients. Further experiments revealed that serum taken from recovered animals, 24 hr after re-challenge, was alone capable of transferring immunity to normal recipients. Using immunofluorescent techniques to assay titres of anti-leishmanial antibody, a temporal relationship was found between high antibody titres {{and the ability of}} serum to contribute positively to the <b>adoptive</b> <b>immunization</b> of normal recipients.

40|$|After {{subcutaneous}} inoculation {{into the}} hind {{foot of a}} mouse, the lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus multiplies locally, attaining 10 (7) - 10 (8) mouse infectious units per g of tissue; elimination commences around day 7. About 1 day earlier, the foot begins to swell, which {{is regarded as a}} delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction.

In contrast, for virus elimination only the former subset of T lymphocytes was found to be needed.

HCV-LP immunization elicited a significantly stronger humoral immune response than DNA immunization. HCV-LP-immunized mice also developed stronger HCV-specific cellular immune responses than DNA-immunized mice as determined by using quantitative enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay and intracellular cytokine staining. In BALB/c mice, immunization with HCV-LPs resulted in a > 5 log 10 reduction in vaccinia titer when challenged with a recombinant vaccinia expressing the HCV structural proteins (vvHCV.

40|$|The hind {{foot was}} chosen for study of the {{mechanism}} by which adult mice clear lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus. The T cell-mediated swelling that follows the local inoculation of virus allows parallel investigation of the infectious process and delayed-type hypersensitivity in one organ. A dose of 105 mouse infectious units (IU) was optimal, and in all mouse strains tested foot swelling commenced 6 days after injection, with maximal response on days 7 and 8. When mice were sensitized by intravenous (i. v.) infection and challenged locally with infectious virus, the extent of swelling depended on both doses of virus and was most extensive when the interval between primary inoculation and local elicitation was 10 days. The rates of replication of the virus and its clearance were similar in the feet of mice of four strains tested, varying with regard to LCM virus-specific ell-mediated immunity. In CBA/J mice, virus elimination from the foot was followed for a longer time period and was incomplete up to 100 days after infection.

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of arenavirus {{infection is}} considered separately for the haemorrhagic fever (HF) syndrome and for lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus infection of rodents.

Immunobiologic problems currently under investigation in LCM virus infection include the mechanism of immune destruction of infected tissues, the H- 2 restriction of in vitro T-cell-mediated lysis of infected target cells, the transient immunodepression that accompanies acute primary LCM virus infection, and the mechanism of T-cell-mediated clearance of virus from infected tissues following <b>adoptive</b> <b>immunization</b> of persistently infected carrier mice...|$|E

Immunosuppressed mice are protected, often permanently, against acute central nervous system (CNS) disease, and fail to show pathological evidence of choriomeningitis.

In contrast, autografts survived unchanged in size for the life-span of the pedicles which carried them. The slow contracture of the allografts was associated with sensitization of the host because test allografts applied orthotopically were destroyed with a second-set tempo. No regeneration of lymphatics from the long-standing pedicles could be demonstrated, and it was concluded that sensitization had occurred eventually through the blood, presumably by the process of peripheral sensitization. Allografts on skin pedicles could be destroyed rapidly by active or <b>adoptive</b> <b>immunization,</b> so it is probable that the level of sensitization to which they themselves gave rise was a low one.

40|$|Adoptive {{immunity}} {{is poorly}} expressed in normal syngeneic mice. This phenomenon was studied by using experimental antituberculosis immunity {{as a model}} system representing pure cell-mediated immunity. Expression of adoptive immunity was facilitated by pretreating recipients with sublethal ionizing radiation (500 rads) or high doses (200 mg/kg) of cyclophosphamide or by using adult thymectomized, lethally irradiated, bone-marrow-reconstituted (TXB) mice. Adult thymectomy was less effective, and a low dose of cyclophosphamide (20 mg/kg) was completely ineffective. The beneficial effect of sublethal irradiation was reduced over time; it persisted for 4 weeks and was absent after 8 weeks. Attempts to restore the suppressed state of normal mice to sublethally irradiated mice by using normal spleen or thymus cells did not succeed. Even in rats, which express adoptive antituberculosis immunity without immunosuppressive treatment, the use of sublethally irradiated or TXB recipients potentiated adoptive immunity. It was concluded that suppression of <b>adoptive</b> <b>immunization</b> in normal recipient mice is mediated predominantly, if not exclusively, by T lymphocytes that are sensitive {{to a number of}} immunosuppressive agents.

Furthermore, helper T cells were shown to be necessary for the production of antibodies, which also occurs in adoptively immunized mice. In view of this finding, further experiments were performed, which strongly indicated that neither LCM-primed B cells nor LCM-primed helper T cells are present in mice that are persistent virus carriers. Similarly, neither cellular immunity to the LCM virus nor the presence of enhancing factors or suppressor cells could be detected.

Twenty-one of the 27 CH lymphomas studied were classified into five groups, defined by a particular cross-reactive idiotype; four of these groups were linked in a single network. Seven of 16 idiotypes defined by absorption analysis were present on lymphomas bearing either kappa or lambda light chains and so were localized to the heavy chain variable region. The surface Ig on 14 CH lymphomas was found to be specific for epitopes on certain erythrocytes (bromelain-treated autologous erythrocytes, sheep, and chicken erythrocytes) or E. coli. We propose that the CH lymphomas represent the malignant counterparts of a subset of idiotypically related, normal B cells in B 10. H- 2 aH- 4 b p/Wts mice. Perturbation of this idiotype network, by hyperimmunization with an antigen for which some of the members are specific (sheep erythrocytes), increases the risk for neoplasia. Possible mechanisms for this are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiments}} of Hume and Egdahl (1) {{suggest that}} a kidney homograft can sensitize its host {{by way of the}} blood because the graft is destroyed even if it is prevented from reestablishing a lymphatic drainage. This observation implies that kidney homografts may not sensitize {{in the same manner as}} homografts of skin for Billingham et al. (2) and Greene (3) have shown that skin homografts placed in certain "privileged" sites in the hamster and rabbit respectively do not sensitize their hosts even though they become fully vascularized. In addition, histological studies (4) and experiments involving the technique of <b>adoptive</b> <b>immunization</b> (5) have shown that the seat of the reaction to orthotopic homografts of skin is in the regional lymph node; but no particular group of lymph nodes has been shown to play a comparable role in the destruction of kidney homografts. It is not clear how a kidney homograft could sensitize its host by way of the blood. One possibility is that the lymphoid tissue of the host is activated by "free " antigen which is liberated into the blood. However, experiments employing allogeneic cells (6) or tissue extracts (7) have shown the intravenous route to be an inefficient method o...|$|E
40|$|Surgically bursectomized and {{irradiated}} chickens {{were given}} bursal, splenic, bone marrow or thymic cells taken from syngeneic donors, together with killed Brucella abortus and Salmonella pullorum. Blood samples {{were taken from}} those chickens 7 days later, and the serum agglutinin titres were determined. The cells of any lymphoid organ taken from 28 -day-old chickens were more effective in restoring antibody response than those from 18 -day-old ones. The restorative capacities of the bursa and splenic cells were greater {{than those of the}} bone marrow and thymic cells. On the other hand, splenic, bone marrow or thymic cells taken from bursa-less chickens, and lymphoid cells taken from normal chickens but treated with anti-bursa serum in the persence of complement, were virtually incapable of restoring the immune response. Bursal, splenic or bone marrow cells taken from neonatally thymectomized chickens, and bursal or thymic cells treated with anti-thymus serum were effective, being comparable with the corresponding cells taken from normal chickens or treated with normal sera, in restoring the suppressed immune response in chickens devoid of the lymphoid system. These facts clearly indicate that the primary and central agent crucial for development of the humoral immune response against the two bacterial antigens tested is the bursa. It is strongly suggested from the results of <b>adoptive</b> <b>immunization</b> using intrabursally primed cells that the cells recognizing Brucella abortus exist within the bursa of 4 -day-old chicken...|$|E
40|$|The {{usefulness}} of <b>adoptive</b> <b>immunization</b> {{as a method}} for analyzing mechanisms responsible for resolution of Listeria monocytogenes infection was studied. Results showed that, although mice resolving primary infection acquire CD 8 + T cells that are exclusively capable of adoptively immunizing recipient mice against an L. monocytogenes challenge infection, these T cells are protective only if given to recipients at very early stages of infection (soon after the infection is cleared from the blood by fixed phagocytes of the liver and spleen). In contrast the same T cells failed to mediate adoptive immunity against infection if given to recipients 24 h after infection was initiated, when L. monocytogenes {{is no longer in}} fixed phagocytes but is confined to granulo-mas. These results indicate that specific CD 8 + T cells produced in response to infection contrib-ute minimally to resolution of established infection in the donor. We have shown [1] that mice depleted ofCD 8 + and CD 4 + T cells remain capable not only of resolving primary infec-tion with Listeria monocytogenes but of expressing acquired resistance to lethal secondary infection. Yet, it has been re-peatedly demonstrated [2 - 4] that resolution of listeriosis is associated with the generation of T cells capable of adop-tively immunizing normal recipients against a lethal L. monocytogenes challenge infection. This study was under-taken to find an explanation for the apparent contradiction between these two types of results...|$|E
