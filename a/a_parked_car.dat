5|$|Unprecedented {{security}} measures {{were made by}} the Turkish government to safeguard the NATO summit from terrorist attacks. They especially feared a repetition of the Istanbul bombings of 2003 that killed more than 60 people. Their fear was proven by the arrest of 16 people in Bursa in early May on suspicion of planning to bomb the summit. Police seized guns, explosives, bomb-making booklets and 4,000 compact discs with training advice from Osama Bin Laden, and believed that the suspects were members of the radical Islamic group Ansar al-Islam, thought to be linked with al-Qaeda. On June 24 two bombs also exploded. One bomb went off in a bus in Istanbul killing 4 people (including the bomber), the other outside a hotel in Ankara where US president George W. Bush would be staying. Additionally, on June 25, explosives were found in <b>a</b> <b>parked</b> <b>car</b> at Istanbul's main airport.|$|E

500|$|Beyond being Johnny's friend, Mark's {{background}} receives no exposition; when he {{is first}} introduced {{he claims to be}} [...] "very busy" [...] while sitting in <b>a</b> <b>parked</b> <b>car</b> {{in the middle of the}} day, with no explanation ever given as to his occupation or what he was doing. Greg Sestero stated in his memoir, The Disaster Artist, that he created a backstory for the character in which Mark was an undercover vice detective which Sestero felt united several otherwise disparate aspects of Mark's character such as the secretive nature of various aspects of his behavior including marijuana use, his mood swings, and his handling of the Chris-R incident. However, Wiseau dismissed adding any reference to Mark's past to the script. The makers of The Room video game would later introduce a similar idea as part of a subplot involving Mark's unexplained backstory, much to Sestero's amusement.|$|E
500|$|Pryce was {{directly}} behind Stuck's car {{along the main}} straight. Stuck saw Jansen van Vuuren {{and moved to the}} right to avoid both marshals, missing Bill by what Tremayne calls [...] "millimetres". From his position Pryce could not see Jansen van Vuuren and was unable to react as quickly as Stuck had done. He struck the teenage marshal at approximately 270km/h (170mph). Jansen van Vuuren was thrown into the air and landed in front of Zorzi and Bill. He died on impact, and his body was badly mutilated by Pryce's car. The fire extinguisher he had been carrying smashed into Pryce's head, before striking the Shadow's roll hoop. The force of the impact was such that the extinguisher was thrown up and over the adjacent grandstand. It landed in the car park {{to the rear of the}} stand, where it hit <b>a</b> <b>parked</b> <b>car</b> and jammed its door shut.|$|E
