5|$|While {{producers}} Broccoli and Saltzman originally sought Cary Grant for the role, they discarded {{the idea}} as Grant would {{be committed to}} only one feature film, and the producers decided to go <b>after</b> <b>someone</b> who {{could be part of}} a series. Richard Johnson has claimed to have been the first choice of the director, but he turned it down because he already had a contract with MGM and was intending to leave. Another actor purported to have been considered for the role was Patrick McGoohan on the strength of his portrayal of spy John Drake in the television series Danger Man: McGoohan turned down the role. Another potential Bond included David Niven, who would later play the character in the 1967 parody Casino Royale.|$|E

25|$|He {{managed to}} escape from the Verviers prison on 4 July 1979. Although Ražnatović was apprehended in the Netherlands on 24 October 1979, the few months he was free were enough for at least two more armed robberies in Sweden and three more in the Netherlands. Serving a seven-year {{sentence}} at a prison in Amsterdam, he pulled off another escape on 8 May 1981 <b>after</b> <b>someone</b> slipped him a gun. Wasting no time, more robberies followed, this time in Germany, where after less than a month of freedom he was arrested in Frankfurt on 5 June 1981 following a jewellery store stickup. In the ensuing shootout with police he was lightly wounded, resulting in his placement in the prison hospital ward, where looser security allowed him to escape again only four days later, on 9 June, supposedly by jumping from the window, beating up the first bystander and stealing his clothing before disappearing.|$|E

25|$|Shortly afterwards, {{passing through}} the Hall of Abraham, Goldstein entered the Hall of Isaac, where some 800 Muslims were at prayer. He was dressed in his army uniform and carried an IMI Galil assault rifle and four {{magazines}} of ammunition, which held a total of 140 rounds in 35 rounds per magazine. He was not stopped by the guards, who assumed {{that he was an}} officer entering the tomb to pray in an adjacent chamber reserved for Jews. Standing in front of the only exit from the hall and positioned {{to the rear of the}} Muslim worshippers, is reported as having thrown a grenade into the middle of the hall, and then opened fire, killing 29 people and wounding another 125, among them children.

40|$|This article {{concentrates}} on the elegy which has some problems {{in the process of}} transformation into folk song. The content of elegies are based on the context in which they are mourned <b>after</b> <b>someone's</b> death. For this reason, if the context changes, its meaning changes as well. In other words, the elegy, a part of the mental pain, can sometimes {{become a part of the}} entertainment in the process of turning into folk song. This process also includes the compilation of elegies. Hence, the argument of the article appears that the meaning of the elegy cannot be understood without taking into consideration both their context and process of compilation...|$|R
