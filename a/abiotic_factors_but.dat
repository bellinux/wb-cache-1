40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that regional variation in community structure is largely driven by <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>but</b> that these factors have less influence on community structure at smaller scales. We sought to investigate the potential role of select abiotic factors in regulating benthic communities at spatial scales ranging from 10 to 1000 meters. This was accomplished by comparing benthic point-intercept survey data against measurements of depth, slope, aspect and current flow. Results indicated that substrate depth and slope significantly correlated with observed differences in community composition, while current flow was marginally correlated with community composition. These results suggest that abiotic factors still {{play an important role in}} the structuring of biological communities at local scales. ...|$|E

The linkage of abiotic and biotic environmental factors and bacterial {{community as well}} as phylotypes was analysed by the ordination technique of Canonical Correspondance Analysis (CCA). Generally, an influence of temperature and phytoplankton on the bacterial community during the sampling period was observed. Additionally, multivariate analysis by factors revealed an influence on specific bacterial phylotypes by these factors.

40|$|Geographical range {{limits are}} thought to be set by species' {{physiological}} or ecological adaptation to <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>but</b> the importance of biotic factors such as parasitism in determining range limits has not been well explored. In this study the prevalence of trematode parasitism in populations of a freshwater gastropod snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, increased sharply as this species approached its western UK range limit. The likelihood of trematode infection increased with snail size, but high prevalence at the range edge was not a result of interpopulation variation in snail size. Changes in population growth rates resulting from high rates of parasitism at the range edge could contribute to range limitation. The mechanism driving high rates of parasitism at the range edge is not clear, but changes in abiotic factors towards the range limit may influence snail life history and immune response to trematode infection, indirectly altering the prevalence of parasites in marginal host populations...|$|E

We integrated extensive proteomic, geochemical, and biological information from 28 microbial communities collected from an acid mine drainage environment and representing a range of biofilm development stages and geochemical conditions to evaluate how the physiologies of the dominant and less abundant organisms change along environmental gradients. The initial colonist dominates across all environments, but its proteome changes between two stable states as communities diversify, implying that interspecies interactions affect this organism's metabolism. Its overall physiology is robust to <b>abiotic</b> environmental <b>factors,</b> <b>but</b> strong correlations exist between these factors and certain subsets of proteins, possibly accounting for its wide environmental distribution.

They potentially {{have a strong}} influence on the terrestrial carbon and energy cycles, because of their vast area and the large carbon stocks in their peat soils in the permafrost. In this study, we elucidated intersite variation of ecosystem photosynthetic and respiratory parameters of eight larch forests in East Asia using the CarboEastAsia carbon flux and micrometeorology dataset. These parameters were determined using the empirical relationship between the carbon fluxes (photosynthesis and respiration) and micrometeorological variables (light and temperature). In addition, we examined leaf area index (LAI) determined by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data to explain the intersite variation. Linear or exponential relationships with annual mean temperature or seasonal maximum LAI at the study sites were found for the annual carbon fluxes (gross primary production [GPP] and total ecosystem respiration [RE]) {{as well as for}} four of the five seasonal maximum values of determined photosynthetic and respiratory parameters (maximum GPP at light saturation, initial slope of the light-response curve, daytime respiration, and RE at the reference temperature of 10 degrees C). Phenological indices, such as start day of the growing season, growing season length and growing season degree days explained much of the intersite variation of GPP and RE of the studied larch forests; however, the relationship between MODIS LAI and photosynthetic or respiratory parameters implies that the intersite variation in GPP and RE was caused not only by the temperature variation (<b>abiotic</b> <b>factor),</b> <b>but</b> also by the variation in the photosynthetic and respiration activity by vegetation (biotic factor) through the change in leaf (or whole vegetation) biomass. Our analysis shows that MODIS LAI serves as a good index to explain the variation of the ecosystem photosynthetic and respiratory characteristics of East Asian larch forests...|$|R

Nevertheless, the continually growing knowledge on vegetal physiology allows describing symptoms and physiological reactions in plants quite similar to the human ones.

40|$|Many {{phytoplankton}} species form resting cysts {{and remain}} dormant {{for part of}} the year. The subsequent excystment is regulated by the external environment and internal maturation processes. Here we assessed the excystment of the dinoflagellates Ceratium hirundinella and Peridinium aciculiferum in relation to herbivores and temperature in laboratory and field studies. C. hirundinella, which has a grazer-resistant morphology, forms summer blooms, whereas P. aciculiferum, which is vulnerable to grazers, grows underneath the ice during winter. In our study, herbivore abundance, and thereby grazing pressure, was low during periods when water temperatures were low, and the abundance of P. aciculiferum was high. In the laboratory experiment, excystment of C. hirundinella occurred at high temperatures irrespective of whether zooplankton exudate was added or not, whereas at intermediate temperatures, excystment was lower if zooplankton exudate was added. Germination of P. aciculiferum cysts was lower in the presence of exudate from a zooplankton culture than in controls at all temperatures. Our studies suggest that dinoflagellates use the presence of zooplankton in addition to temperature as a cue to determine when to excyst.

Hypnea musciformis was the most frequent epiphyte on S. filipendula, occurring in all sampling periods, although with significant temporal variation. Sargassum filipendula density and dry mass were both influenced by epiphyte dry mass, temperature, and amphipod grazers.

We grew one ramet of B. planiculmis {{in the center of each}} of the experimental boxes without competitors (Schoenoplectus triqueter), with a homogeneous distribution of the competitors of low or high density, and with a patchy distribution of the competitors of low or high density. The presence of competitors markedly decreased the growth (biomass, number of ramets, number of tubers and rhizome length) of the B. planiculmis clones. When the density of the competitors was low, the growth of B. planiculmis did not differ significantly between the competitor patches and competitor-free patches. However, when the density of the competitors was high, the growth of B. planiculmis was significantly higher in the competitor-free patches than in the competitor patches. Therefore, B. planiculmis can respond to patchy distributions of competitors by placing more ramets in competition-free patches when the density of competitors is high, but cannot do so when the density of competitors is low...|$|E

In corn (Zea mays), this induced odor blend is mainly composed of terpenoids and indole.

Each factor was tested separately under constant conditions for the other factors. Plants released more when standing in dry soil than in wet soil, whereas for air humidity, the optimal release was found at around 60 % relative humidity. Temperatures between 22 °C and 27 °C led to a higher emission than lower or higher temperatures. Light intensity had a dramatic effect. The emission of volatiles did not occur in the dark and increased steadily with an increase in the light intensity. An experiment with an unnatural light-dark cycle showed that the release was fully photophase dependent. Fertilization also had a strong positive effect; the emission of volatiles was minimal when plants were grown under low nutrition, even when results were corrected for plant biomass. Changes in all <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> caused small <b>but</b> significant changes in the relative ratios among the different compounds (quality) in the induced odor blends, except for air humidity.

Soil moisture was modelled in the range of 0 – 0. 3 m. At both sites, current patterns showed that the mean seasonal soil moisture was (1) near field capacity for grasslands with low management intensity and (2) below field capacity for grasslands with higher land-use intensity. Soil moisture was significantly reduced by drought at both sites, with lower reductions at the drier Lautaret site. At the sub-watershed scale, soil moisture spatial heterogeneity was reduced by drought. Under drought conditions, the evapotranspiration to precipitation ratios at Stubai was slightly higher than those at Lautaret, indicating a dominant 'water spending' strategy of plant communities. Regarding catchment water balance, deep seepage was reduced by drought at Stubai more strongly than at Lautaret. Hence, the observed 'water spending' strategy at Stubai might have negative consequences for downstream water users. Assessing the water provision service for alpine grasslands provided evidence that, under drought conditions, evapotranspiration was influenced not only by <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> <b>but</b> also by the water-use strategy of established vegetation. These results highlight the importance of 'water-use' strategies in existing plant communities as predictors of the impacts of drought on water provision services and related ecosystem services at both the field and catchment scale...|$|E

Distribution of sciaphilic epibenthic communities belonging to the `coralligène de la roche littorale´ was investigated at 30 photostations from 17 to 24 m depth on a rocky shoal off the island complex in the Gulf of La Spezia (Ligurian Sea, NW Mediterranean). Four communities displayed a sharp zonation: Paramuricea clavata characterised deeper, vertical surfaces, whereas on horizontal and medium inclination, sediment-covered substrata, Leptogorgia sarmentosa, together with Eunicella singularis and Eunicella verrucosa, characterised the upper stratum of the deeper community. Shallow vertical walls were characterised by a facies with sponges and zoantharians, whereas community dominated by large, massive colonies of Pentapora fascialis with a basal stratum of sciaphilic algal species patched with sediment on shallow rocky slopes of medium inclination. Bathymetric distribution of assemblages is influenced by high seawater turbidity (mean annual transparency: 11. 9 ± 5. 7 m at the western site, 6. 2 ± 1. 6 m at the eastern site), which induces a shift of the upper limit of distribution of these facies to unusually shallow depths.

Dietary niche characterizes the functional role of organisms in a food web, as it reflects both resources' diversity used by a consumer and trophic interactions in the system.

Here, we investigated the variability of dietary niche in salmonid wild populations focusing both on inter-population and intra-population (through time) trophic changes, using marble trout (Salmo marmoratus) living in Slovenian headwater streams as a model system. Stable isotope analysis showed high variability of dietary niche and trophic diversity among six of the seven remnant marble trout populations. We observed substantial differences in dietary niche width among populations and within populations through time. Results of partial least square path modelling highlighted opposite effects of immature and mature trout on trophic niche structure. Direct effects of temperature and slope (stream and watershed) were opposite; temperature narrowed dietary niches while slope increased them. Environmental factors (e. g., temperature, stream and watershed slope) had indirect effects on trophic niches after accounting for fish density. Our results showed that size-distribution and sexual maturity are key determinants of the dietary niche width in a population. Increasing density of immature trout tended to widen the dietary niche while increasing density of mature trout tended to narrow it.

Still the humpbacks face many threats {{and global warming}} is predicted to cause even more threats. Many experiments have been done on phytoplankton and the reaction to changed <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>but</b> the reaction to higher throphic levels is unclear. Here these indirect effects of global warming induced phytoplankton changes to humpbacks is studied. In this thesis I found that indirect effects of global warming on phytoplankton to humpbacks can become a serious threat, with two pathways in special: a trophic mismatch and declining krill populations. Humpbacks {{are known for their}} migration from breeding grounds in the low latitudes towards the feeding grounds in high latitudes. Global warming is causing earlier chlorophyll peaks in the Arctic feeding sites. Earlier spring blooms can cause earlier zooplankton and fish peaks. Especially females with newborn calves have a higher risk for this mismatch, since they leave the breeding areas the latest. In the Antarctic, phytoplankton community composition is shifting towards smaller species, which are less efficient grazed by krill. A decline in krill population is therefore expected. Other global warming induced factors, like melting ice cover and declining chlorophyll concentrations can only amplify this decline. Beside changes in the food chain, global warming is likely to cause other threats. Human activities in the Arctic will increase leading to more pollution and noise. Pathogenes will probably increase, with as result a decline in humpback health. All threats together can be disastrous for the humpback. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Marine lineage {{diversification}} {{is shaped}} by the interaction of biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> <b>but</b> our understanding of their relative roles is underdeveloped. The megadiverse bivalve superfamily Galeommatoidea represents a promising study system to address this issue. It is composed of small-bodied clams that are either free-living or have commensal associations with invertebrate hosts. To test if the evolution of this lifestyle dichotomy is correlated with specific ecologies, we have performed a statistical analysis on the lifestyle and habitat preference of 121 species based on 90 source documents. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Galeommatoidea has significant diversity in the two primary benthic habitats: hard- and soft-bottoms. Hard-bottom dwellers are overwhelmingly free-living, typically hidden within crevices of rocks/coral heads/encrusting epifauna. In contrast, species in soft-bottom habitats are almost exclusively infaunal commensals. These infaunal biotic associations may involve direct attachment to a host, or clustering around its tube/burrow, but all commensals locate within the oxygenated sediment envelope produced by the host's bioturbation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: the formation of commensal associations by Galeommatoidean clams is robustly correlated with an abiotic environmental setting: living in sediments (P < 0. 001). Sediment-dwelling bivalves are exposed to intense predation pressure that drops markedly with depth of burial. Commensal galeommatoideans routinely attain depth refuges many times their body lengths, independent of siphonal investment, {{by virtue of their}} host's burrowing and bioturbation. In effect, they use their much larger hosts as giant auto-irrigating siphon substitutes. The evolution of biotic associations with infaunal bioturbating hosts may have been a prerequisite for the diversification of Galeommatoidea in sediments and has likely been a key factor in the success of this exceptionally diverse bivalve superfamily...|$|E

Then it is expected that C cycling is fast and C accumulation is small in soil of grassland subjected to elevated CO 2. Here, we report results of dynamics and demography of roots and soil respiration of perennial grassland monoliths exposed to four different treatments: Control (C), Temperature (T, + 3 °C in comparison with control), Temperature x Drought (TD, + 3 °C and 20 % lower summer precipitations than in control) and Temperature x Drought x CO 2, according to A 2 scenario (IPCC, 2001) (TDCO 2, + 3 °C, - 20 % summer precipitations and CO 2 200 ppm above control). Root dynamics was measured by minirhizotron method and soil respiration was measured by a closed chamber technique. Results obtained for the three first years showed a significant increase of root growth (+ 33 %) and new roots mean diameter (+ 6 %) in the TDCO 2 compared to control.

It is endemic to several islands of the Macaronesian biogeographic region, confined to the humid areas limited by {{the influence of the}} trade wind clouds. In recent times this relict forest vegetation, which once covered large proportions of the Canary Islands, suffered from a massive range reduction and fragmentation due to human exploitation. This thesis evaluates the phylogeography and population structure of the laurel forest on the basis of two characteristic plant taxa representative for the whole vegetation complex: The widespread and dominant canopy-building tree species Laurus novocanariensis and the more constrictive Canary Island endemic Ixanthus viscosus. Analyses exhibit low levels of differentiation on within- as well as between-island level. Especially for Laurus the exchange between populations from different islands, even over longer distances, is obvious. On island level the forest fragmentation has low impact on population divergence up to now. Furthermore, we localised the genetic hotspots of both model species within the laurel forest distribution range on Tenerife. A small-scale grid square sampling strategy combined with approaches from population and landscape genetics enabled the development of detailed maps showing the centres of genetic diversity and thus revealing the connection between forest fragmentation and diversity loss. Additionally, we analysed the ecological preferences of the two species, recognising not <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>but</b> rather past forest degradation as having the most important impact on the current distribution range of the endemic Ixanthus.

Despite their well-studied biology and reproductive physiology, the current knowledge of their ectoparasite fauna is limited and ambiguous due to recent revisions of the bathyergid taxonomy. The common mole-rat (Cryptomys hottentotus hottentotus) is 1 {{of the most widely}} distributed species of these subterranean rodents. Ectoparasites were collected from 268 common mole-rats at 2 localities (Western and Northern Cape provinces) in South Africa over the course of 18 mo with the aim to document species richness, prevalence, and abundance of these ectoparasites. The aggregation of parasite species, sex bias within a species, and seasonal variation in ectoparasite burdens were investigated. A total of 4, 830 individual parasites from 4 mite species (Androlaelaps scapularis, Androlaelaps capensis, Radfordia ensifera, and 1 undetermined chigger [family Trombiculidae]), 1 flea species (Cryptopsylla ingrami), and 1 louse species (Eulinognathus hilli) were collected. With the exception of R. ensifera and the chigger, all of these ectoparasites appear to be host specific either for the host species or the Bathyergidae. Aggregation indices indicated that with the exception of E. hilli, the distribution of all parasite species was highly aggregated among hosts and sex biased. Seasonal variation in prevalence, abundance, and species richness was apparent, with greater burdens in the rainy winter season. This is likely related to seasonal variation in <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> <b>but</b> may also be affected by the timing of host reproduction and dispersal behavior.

40|$|Permafrost-affected soils in the Northern latitudes store {{huge amounts}} of organic carbon (OC) that is prone to {{microbial}} degradation and subsequent release of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. In Greenland, the consequences of permafrost thaw have only recently been addressed, and predictions on {{its impact on the}} carbon budget are thus still highly uncertain. However, the fate of OC is not only determined by <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>but</b> closely tied to microbial activity. We investigated eight soil profiles in northeast Greenland comprising two sites with typical tundra vegetation and one wet fen site. We assessed microbial community structure and diversity (SSU rRNA gene tag sequencing, quantification of bacteria, archaea and fungi), and measured hydrolytic and oxidative enzyme activities. Sampling site and thus abiotic factors {{had a significant impact on}} microbial community structure, diversity and activity, the wet fen site exhibiting higher potential enzyme activities and presumably being a hot spot for anaerobic degradation processes such as fermentation and methanogenesis. Lowest fungal to bacterial ratios were found in topsoils that had been relocated by cryoturbation (buried topsoils), resulting from a decrease in fungal abundance compared to recent (unburied) topsoils. Actinobacteria (in particular Intrasporangiaceae) accounted for a major fraction of the microbial community in buried topsoils, but were only of minor abundance in all other soil horizons. It was indicated that the distribution pattern of Actinobacteria and a variety of other bacterial classes was related to the activity of phenol oxidases and peroxidases supporting the hypothesis that bacteria might resume the role of fungi in oxidative enzyme production and degradation of phenolic and other complex substrates in these soils. Our study sheds light on the highly diverse, but poorly-studied communities in permafrost-affected soils in Greenland and their role in OC degradation...|$|E
40|$|A healthy {{ecosystem}} is {{a result}} of balanced interaction between biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors.</b> Water temperature, pH, DO, FCO 2, TA, TH etc are the most important <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> influencing the physico-chemical and biological events of water body (Rahman et al., 2008). All species have their own optimal range for these abiotic parameters. In relation to aquatic life, there maturation time is also dependent on these parameters.
