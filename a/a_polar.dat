5|$|<b>A</b> <b>polar</b> ice cap, or {{polar ice}} sheet, is a high-latitude region {{of a planet}} or moon that is covered in ice. Ice caps form because high-latitude regions receive less energy as solar {{radiation}} from the sun than equatorial regions, resulting in lower surface temperatures.|$|E

5|$|The next {{mission to}} {{encounter}} Jupiter was the Ulysses solar probe. It performed a flyby maneuver to attain <b>a</b> <b>polar</b> {{orbit around the}} Sun. During this pass, the spacecraft conducted studies on Jupiter's magnetosphere. Ulysses has no cameras so no images were taken. A second flyby six years later was at a much greater distance.|$|E
5|$|The north-south {{extent of}} the {{province}} (46°36'N to 60°22'N), prevalent westerly winds, cold ocean currents and local factors such as mountains and coastline combine to create the various climates of the province.

5|$|The series {{follows the}} {{survivors}} of the crash of a commercial passenger jet flying between Sydney and Los Angeles, on a mysterious tropical island somewhere in the South Pacific Ocean. In this episode, John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) recovers from the Hatch implosion and rescues Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) from <b>a</b> <b>polar</b> bear. Locke is featured in the episode's flashbacks.|$|E
40|$|Explicit coding schemes are {{proposed}} {{to achieve the}} rate-distortion function of the Heegard-Berger problem using <b>polar</b> codes. Specifically, <b>a</b> nested <b>polar</b> code construction is employed to achieve the rate-distortion function for the doubly-symmetric binary sources when the side information may be absent. The nested structure contains two optimal polar codes for lossy source coding and channel coding, respectively. Moreover, <b>a</b> similar nested <b>polar</b> lattice construction is employed when the source and the side information are jointly Gaussian. The proposed polar lattice is constructed by nesting <b>a</b> quantization <b>polar</b> lattice and <b>a</b> capacity-achieving <b>polar</b> lattice for the additive white Gaussian noise channel...|$|R

5|$|The series {{takes place}} over the span of six books, which are: The Quest Begins, Great Bear Lake, Smoke Mountain, The Last Wilderness, Fire in the Sky, and Spirits in the Stars. The story follows four young bears. Lusa, a black bear, Kallik, <b>a</b> <b>polar</b> bear, Toklo, a grizzly bear and Ujurak, {{who is able to}} shape-shift into any animal, but remains a brown bear most of the time.|$|E
5|$|While {{designing}} the Creighton-Ward Mansion sets, Bell {{and his staff}} strove for authenticity, ordering miniature Tudor paintings, -scale Georgian- and Regency-style furniture and carpeting {{in the shape of}} <b>a</b> <b>polar</b> bear skin. This realism was enhanced by adding scrap items acquired from household waste and electronics shops. For example, a vacuum cleaner pipe serves as Virgil Tracy's launch chute.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>polar</b> bear—the {{guardian}} of the ice wand—raises the ice wand from beneath the ocean. The fairies add an ice wand to each planet of the Solar System. Along with the white wand at Fairy World, the ice wands create a celestial smile that projects its light into The Darkness. The smile transforms it into a bright sun, The Kindness, and Timmy concludes The Darkness was only looking for a friend. The group returns to Dimmsdale, where an Eliminator, dubbed a 'Hug'inator by Cosmo, crashes {{in front of them}} and spews out everyone who had been sucked in. Everyone parties in Fairy World and celebrates the chosen one's accomplishment.|$|E

Six months later, this pole will experience a midnight sun, a day of 24 hours, again reversing with the South Pole.|$|E
5|$|Early on October 25, Hurricane Fox {{entered the}} Atlantic Ocean. It crossed central Andros and turned east across the Bahamas. On October 26, the {{hurricane}} briefly re-intensified as it crossed Cat Island. The center became ill-defined, and the cyclone quickly weakened. It turned north {{and then took}} an erratic northeast turn as it weakened to a tropical storm on October 27. The system gained extratropical characteristics as it merged with <b>a</b> <b>polar</b> frontal boundary, and it dissipated west-southwest of Bermuda on October 28.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a 9-year-old female blacktip shark at the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center {{was found}} to be {{pregnant}} with a single near-term female pup, despite having never mated with a male. Genetic analysis confirmed that her offspring was the product of automictic parthenogenesis, a form of asexual reproduction in which an ovum merges with <b>a</b> <b>polar</b> body to form a zygote without fertilization. Along with an earlier case of parthenogenesis in the bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo), this event suggests that asexual reproduction may be more widespread in sharks than previously thought.|$|E

It returned to the 509th, now designated the 509th Bombardment Group, in September. On 3 September 1948, during <b>a</b> <b>polar</b> navigation training mission, it developed an engine problem after takeoff from Goose Bay Air Base, Labrador, and ran off the end of the runway when attempting to land. Heavily damaged, it never flew again, and was eventually scrapped at Goose Bay in September 1949, despite its historical significance.|$|E
5|$|Nunavut {{features}} {{a number of}} outdoor adventure activity opportunities {{as a result of}} the territory's vast uninhabited area. Wildlife watching is one particularly popular activity - the territory is home to walrus and belugas, as well as eleven bird sanctuaries housing millions of birds. Muskox are also spread throughout Nunavut, although the territory's tourism authority does not promote 'muskox watching' trips specifically. The territory is also home to a population of polar bears, and trips designed to increase tourists' chances of spotting <b>a</b> <b>polar</b> bear are common. A number of private operators offer wildlife, bird, polar and whale watching tours, in addition to other activities.|$|E
5|$|On December 4 Nina {{had reached}} its peak {{intensity}} of 85mph. At this time, <b>a</b> <b>polar</b> high pressure system moved {{off the coast of}} Japan. The system reached Nina on December 6 and forced the hurricane into a southward path. Twenty hours after the turn, the cold air from the system got trapped inside the circulation of Nina and caused the storm to rapidly dissipate. The last advisory on the system was issued early on December 7 while Nina was at depression strength south of Midway Atoll.|$|E

5|$|Polar {{bears are}} the iconic symbol of Svalbard, {{and one of}} the main tourist attractions. The animals are {{protected}} and people moving outside the settlements are required to have appropriate scare devices to ward off attacks. They are also advised to also carry a firearm for use as a last resort. A British schoolboy was killed by <b>a</b> <b>polar</b> bear in 2011. Svalbard and Franz Joseph Land share a common population of 3,000 polar bears, with Kong Karls Land being the most important breeding ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{organs of}} farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while {{fishermen}} supplied those of pinnipeds {{and the smaller}} whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was {{able to continue to}} collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of <b>a</b> <b>polar</b> bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{tracking}} inland on July16, {{interaction with}} China's mountainous terrain disrupted {{the organization of}} Billie, weakening it down to tropical storm intensity. However, the tropical cyclone's stint over land was short-lived as the system quickly curved northward into the Yellow Sea by July17. Despite moving back over water, Billie continued to weaken, and made landfall on the western coast of North Korea with winds of 75km/h (40mph). Over the Korean peninsula, Billie began to intake cold air from <b>a</b> <b>polar</b> front, enabling the system to transition into an extratropical cyclone by 1800UTC that day. These remnants tracked eastward across the Sea of Japan before they were last noted just off of Hokkaido on July18.|$|E
