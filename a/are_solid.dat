5|$|The Auxois is a horse breed {{from eastern}} France. It {{is a large}} breed, with some {{individuals}} weighing over , bred for horse meat, agricultural work and leisure pursuits. Overall, members of the breed <b>are</b> <b>solid</b> and muscular in appearance.

5|$|The three group 12 {{elements}} that occur naturally are zinc, cadmium and mercury. They are all {{widely used in}} electric and electronic applications, {{as well as in}} various alloys. The first two members of the group share similar properties as they <b>are</b> <b>solid</b> metals under standard conditions. Mercury is the only metal that is a liquid at room temperature. While zinc is very important in the biochemistry of living organisms, cadmium and mercury are both highly toxic. As copernicium does not occur in nature, it has to be synthesized in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Ultrasound of {{the thyroid}} {{may be used}} to reveal whether {{structures}} <b>are</b> <b>solid</b> or filled with fluid, helping to differentiate between nodules and goitres and cysts. It may also help differentiate between malignant and benign lesions. A fine needle aspiration biopsy may be taken concurrently of thyroid tissue to determine the nature of a lesion. These biopsies are then sent for histopathology and cytology. When further imaging is required, a radiolabelled iodine-123 or technetium-99 uptake scan may take place. This can determine {{the size and shape of}} lesions, reveal whether nodules or goitres are metabolically active, and reveal and monitor sites of thyroid disease or cancer deposits outside the thyroid.|$|E
5|$|Tylopilus plumbeoviolaceus (formerly Boletus plumbeoviolaceus), {{commonly}} known as the violet-grey bolete, is a fungus of the bolete family. First described in 1936, the mushroom has a disjunct distribution, and is distributed in eastern North America and Korea. The fruit bodies of the fungus are violet when young, but fade into a chocolate brown color when mature. They <b>are</b> <b>solid</b> and relatively large—cap diameter up to , with a white pore surface that later turns pink, and a white mycelium {{at the base of the}} stem. Like most boletes of genus Tylopilus, the mushroom is inedible due to its bitter taste. A number of natural products have been identified from the fruit bodies, including unique chemical derivatives of ergosterol, a fungal sterol.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{other species}} of the family Cotingidae, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock makes its nest on rocky cliff faces and caves {{rather than in the}} trees. The female lays one or two eggs in the nest of mud and plant material, which is {{attached}} by saliva to a vertical rock. The male does not participate in the building of the nest or the incubation of the eggs. Eggs typically incubate for 27–28 days. The ideal nesting sites for this species are usually located in a cave or vertical rock face with crevices that provide some shelter and protection from the elements. The nests themselves <b>are</b> <b>solid</b> moldings formed from mud and plant material deposited into the crevices. Due to the solid nature of these nests, they typically persist from one breeding season to the next. Females will make repairs to their nests as a breeding season begins.|$|E
