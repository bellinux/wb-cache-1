25|$|Research {{shows that}} religiosity moderates the {{relationship}} between “thinking about meaning of life” and life satisfaction.

Religiosity has also been found to moderate {{the relationship between}} negative affect and life satisfaction, such that life satisfaction is less strongly influenced by the frequency of negative emotions in more religious (vs less religious) individuals.|$|E

Current scholarship supports the Normanist argument – that the Rus were a primarily Scandinavian people – {{but there have been}} heated debates in the last century between certain scholars fueled by nationalism. It is now generally accepted that the Rus' were of Scandinavian origin but adopted Slavic cultural characteristics fairly quickly.|$|E
