500|$|In {{the wake}} of the actor Robin Williams' suicide, Savage said that suicide is an [...] "aggressive act" [...] that shows no {{consideration}} for loved ones left behind. The assertion prompted criticism, but a caller to The Savage Nation said the radio host's frank talk about the subject helped him decide to not take his own life. A caller who identified himself as Joe told Savage he had been contemplating suicide for the past several months, and especially in the most recent week previous to the call. After Savage discovered that Joe was suffering financially, he asked his audience to join in helping Joe get {{through the rest of the}} month by donating through the Savage Legal Defense Fund. The Fund raised over $10,000 in just a few days. <b>Another</b> <b>caller</b> from Detroit had given Savage a jolt by referring to his days as a phone line crisis counselor as being predominantly dealing with suicide calls. The advice that the Detroit caller had given – [...] "you are taking a permanent solution for a temporary problem" [...] encouraged Savage to reach out to the suicidal caller he had.|$|E

60|$|Late that {{afternoon}} <b>another</b> <b>caller</b> thundered {{at the door}} of the house in Berkeley Square. The Duke of Westerham desired to see Miss Le Mesurier. The butler was respectful but doubtful. Miss Le Mesurier had just arrived from a journey and was lying down. The Duke, however, was insistent. He waited twenty minutes in a small back morning-room and presently Jeanne came in to him.|$|E

You got nothing better to do than to put me down, you piece of garbage? You got nothing to do today? Go eat a sausage, and choke on it. Get trichinosis. Now do we have <b>another</b> nice <b>caller</b> here who's busy because he didn't have a nice night in the bathhouse who's angry at me today? Put another, put another sodomite on ... no more calls? ... I don't care about these bums; they mean nothing to me. They're all sausages.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps I exaggerate. Love, {{living or}} dying, {{even if it}} is not blind, cannot, I suppose, focus objects very precisely. It sees only itself or disillusionment. Whether or not, the duel was interrupted. In the full light of the window, Fanny turned softly {{at the opening of the}} door. Marvell was announcing <b>another</b> <b>caller.</b> At his name my heart leapt up like William Wordsworth's at the rainbow. It was Sir Walter Pollacke.|$|E
60|$|The Honourable Hilary had had <b>another</b> <b>caller</b> {{that morning}} besides Dr. Harmon,--no less a personage than the {{president}} of the Northeastern Railroads himself, who had driven down from Fairview immediately after breakfast. Austen having gone to the station, Dr. Tredway had received Mr. Flint in the darkened hall, and had promised to telephone to Fairview the verdict of the specialist. At present Dr. Tredway did not think it wise to inform Hilary of Mr. Flint's visit--not, at least, until after the examination.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Helstone {{was about}} to add to this speech some half-jesting, half-serious {{warnings}} to Miss Keeldar {{on the subject of}} her rumoured partiality for her talented tenant, when a ring at the door, announcing <b>another</b> <b>caller,</b> checked his raillery; and as that other caller appeared {{in the form of a}} white-haired elderly gentleman, with a rather truculent countenance and disdainful eye--in short, our old acquaintance, and the rector's old enemy, Mr. Yorke--the priest and Levite seized his hat, and with the briefest of adieus to Miss Keeldar and the sternest of nods to her guest took an abrupt leave.|$|E

60|$|The last of our reunions--and one no less happy {{than the}} rest--was {{towards the end}} of the month of March. On the morning of the {{following}} 25th of April I received a telegram summoning me to Lyndsey. I arrived there the same afternoon, and was admitted by Mrs Bowater, Miss M.'s excellent, but somewhat Dickensian, housekeeper, then already a little deaf and elderly. I found her in extreme distress. It appeared that the evening before, about seven o'clock, Mrs Bowater had heard voices in the house--Miss M.'s and <b>another's.</b> Friendly <b>callers</b> were infrequent; unfamiliar ones extremely rare; and Mrs Bowater confessed that she had felt some curiosity, if not concern, as to who this stranger might be, and how he had gained admission. She blamed herself beyond measure--though I endeavoured to reassure the good woman--for not instantly setting her misgivings at rest.|$|R
2500|$|Eli Strand (1943–2008), known when calling as [...] "Eli from Westchester", was <b>another</b> famous repeat <b>caller.</b> Citing racism as the {{underlying}} factor behind {{any number of}} sports happenings, he was occasionally banned from calling for periods of time. One {{of the most famous}} times he was banned was by former mid-day host Russ Salzberg. However, he was also given an on-air tryout for the job which would eventually go to Joe Benigno. Strand, from Tuckahoe, New York, played college football at Iowa State University and spent two years in the NFL with the Pittsburgh Steelers and New Orleans Saints.|$|R

And now, as we have still an hour or two before the court, I want to run you up to my house in my motor. My wife is very anxious to have a little luncheon with you." ...|$|E
60|$|Late that afternoon, {{while she}} was still hesitating, there came <b>another</b> <b>caller</b> to the cottage in Park Lane. She was still hesitating, feeling that she had as yet another night before her. Should she be Duchess of Omnium or not? All that she wished to be, she could not be;--but to be Duchess of Omnium was within her reach. Then she began to ask herself various questions. Would the Queen refuse to accept her in her new rank? Refuse! How could any Queen refuse to accept her? She had not done aught amiss in life. There was no slur on her name; no stain on her character. What though her father had been a small attorney, and her first husband a Jew banker! She had broken no law of God or man, had been accused of {{breaking}} no law, which breaking or which accusation need {{stand in the way of}} her being as good a duchess as any other woman! She was sitting thinking of this, almost angry with herself at the awe with which the proposed rank inspired her, when Lady Glencora was announced to her.|$|E
60|$|Miss Mackenzie {{had been}} three weeks at Littlebath {{when the day}} arrived on which she {{was to go to}} Mrs Stumfold's party, and up to that time she had not enjoyed much of the society of that very social place. Indeed, in these pages have been {{described}} with accuracy all the advancement which she had made in that direction. She had indeed returned Miss Todd's call, but had not found that lady at home. In doing this she had almost felt herself to be guilty of treason against the new allegiance which she seemed to have taken upon herself in accepting Mrs Stumfold's invitation; and she had done it at last not from any firm resolve of which she might have been proud, but had been driven to it by ennui, and by the easy temptation of Miss Todd's neighbouring door. She had, therefore, slipped out, and finding her wicked friend to be not at home, had hurried back again. She had, however, committed herself to a card, and she knew that Mrs Stumfold would hear of it through Miss Baker. Miss Baker's visit she had not returned, being in doubt where Miss Baker lived, being terribly in doubt also whether the Median rules of fashion demanded of her that she should return the call of a lady who had simply come to her with <b>another</b> <b>caller.</b> Her hesitation on this subject had been much, and her vacillations many, but she had thought it safer to abstain. For the last day or two she had been expecting the return of Mr Rubb, junior--keeping herself a prisoner, I fear, during the best hours of the day, so that she might be there to receive him when he did come; but though she had so acted, she had quite resolved to be very cold with him, and very cautious, and had been desirous of seeing him solely with a view to the mercantile necessities of her position. It behoved her certainly to attend to business when business came in her way, and therefore she would take care to be at home when Mr Rubb should call.|$|E
5000|$|In New England, at Suffolk Downs and Rockingham Park, {{a legendary}} {{announcer}} named Babe Rubenstein called races for decades, {{starting in the}} 1930s. Rubenstein, it was said, never miscalled a race. He was working at Rockingham Park {{on the day of}} the 1938 hurricane, when the winds are said to have blown off the broadcast booth from the top of the grandstand. An often told story in the 1950s had it that Babe was contacted by one networks, for possible employment on a national level, as opposed to his work in New England. The story went that as part of the proposed contract Babe would have to change his name. He refused, saying, [...] "I was born Babe Rubenstein and I will die Babe Rubenstein." [...] Jim Hannon was <b>another</b> prominent race <b>caller</b> in New England.|$|R
2500|$|A city-level {{official}} in Liaoning province {{was asked by}} investigators what direction Bo Xilai may have given regarding removing organs from Falun Gong prisoners. The official replied “I was asked {{to take care of}} this task. Party central is actually taking care of this...He [...] was involved quite positively, yeah it seemed quite positive. At that time we mainly talked about it during the meetings within the Standing Committee.” The official hung up after realizing that he had not confirmed the identity of the <b>caller.</b> <b>Another</b> phone call recipient was a medical doctor at a military hospital in Liaoning. When asked about whether Falun Gong practitioners’ organs were ever used in transplant operations at a nearby hospital, the official answered in the affirmative: “All that was processed through the court.” The doctor soon grew uncomfortable with the line of questioning and refused to discuss the issue further without clearance from the hospital’s political division.|$|R
50|$|Most tradio {{programs}} {{follow a}} similar format to each other. Callers {{are given a}} studio line {{in which they can}} call in and advertise, for free, a limited number of items for sale, or request an item to purchase from <b>another</b> listener. The <b>caller</b> then gives a phone number so that other listeners can contact the person for further information. Since the increased prevalence of e-mail and other electronic media, most stations permit the sending in of items to sell via e-mail or fax, though due to regular and/or identity theft concerns some stations will assign a code number to anonymize the transaction and keep identifying information off the air. Most stations also permit listeners to send lists of items through postal mail. Tradio programs are particularly associated with the full service format; tradio was commonly found on Independent Local Radio in the UK when it used a similar format (up to around 1990).|$|R

40|$|Millions {{of people}} {{worldwide}} use voice over IP (VoIP) services {{not only as}} cost-effective alternatives to long distance and international calls but also as unified communication tools, such as video conferencing. Owing to the low cost of new user accounts, each person can easily obtain multiple accounts for various purposes. Rich VoIP functions combined with the low cost of new accounts and connections attract many people, resulting in {{a dramatic increase in}} the number of active user accounts. Internet telephony service providers (ITSPs), therefore, need to deploy VoIP systems to accommodate this growing demand for VoIP user accounts. Attracted people also include bad actors who make calls that are unwanted to callees. Once ITSPs openly connect with each other, unwanted bulk calls will be at least as serious a problem as email spam. This dissertation studies how we can reduce load both on ITSPs and end users to ensure continuing the success of VoIP services. From ITSPs' perspective, the scalability of VoIP servers is of importance and concern. Scalability depends on server implementation and the transport protocol for SIP, VoIP signaling. We conduct experiments to understand the impact of connection-oriented transport protocols, namely, TCP and SCTP, because of the additional costs of handling connections. Contradicting the negative perception of connection-oriented transport protocols, our experimental results demonstrate that the TCP implementation in Linux can maintain comparable capacity to UDP, which is a lightweight connection-less transport protocol. The use of SCTP, on the other hand, requires improving the Linux implementation since the not-well-tested implementation makes a server less scalable. We establish the maximum number of concurrent TCP or SCTP connections as baseline data and suggest better server configurations to minimize the negative impact of handling a large number of connections. Thus, our experimental analysis will also contribute to the design of other servers with a very large number of TCP or SCTP connections. From the perspective of end users, controlling unwanted calls is vital to preserving the VoIP service utility and value. Prior work on preventing unwanted email or calls has mainly focused on detecting unwanted communication requests, leaving many messages or calls unlabeled since false positives during filtering are unacceptable. Unlike prior work, we explore approaches to identifying a "good" call based on signaling messages rather than content. This is because content-based filtering cannot prevent call spam from disturbing callees since a ringing tone interrupts them before content is sent. Our first approach uses "cross-media relations. '' Calls are unlikely to be unwanted if two parties have been previously communicated with each other through other communication means. Specifically, we propose two mechanisms using cross-media relations. For the first mechanism, a potential caller offers her contact addresses which might be used in future calls to the callee. For the second mechanism, a callee provides a potential caller with weak secret for future use. When the caller makes a call, she conveys the information to be identified as someone the callee contacted before through other means. Our prototype illustrates how these mechanisms work in web-then-call and email-then-call scenarios. In addition, our user study of received email messages, calls, SMS messages demonstrates the potential effectiveness of this idea. <b>Another</b> approach uses <b>caller's</b> attributes, such as organizational affiliation, in the case where two parties have had no prior contact. We introduce a lightweight mechanism for validating user attributes with privacy-awareness and moderate security. Unlike existing mechanisms of asserting user attributes, we design to allow the caller to claim her attributes to callees without needing to prove her identity or her public key. To strike the proper balance between the ease of service deployment and security, our proposed mechanism relies on transitive trust, through an attribute validation server, established over transport layer security. This mechanism uses an attribute reference ID, which limits the lifetime and restricts relying parties. Our prototype demonstrates the simplicity of our concept and the possibility of practical use...|$|R

50|$|Some {{models of}} Zenith's System 3 line of {{televisions}} {{made from the}} late 1970s to the early 1990s had a feature called the Space Phone by Zenith. It was basically a hands-free speakerphone built into the television set. It used the set's speaker and remote control, {{in addition to a}} built-in microphone. A Space Phone-enabled television would connect to a telephone jack (using a built-in phone cord), and making a call was performed by pressing a button on the remote to activate the Space Phone (which would mute and begin controlling the program audio going to the speaker). The telephone number is dialed using the numeric keys on the remote, which then displays the digits being dialed on-screen (using the on-screen display features of the System 3 line). The user could then converse with <b>another</b> <b>caller</b> hands-free, much like a regular speakerphone.|$|E
