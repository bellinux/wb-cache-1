40|$|Suppositories are {{important}} tools for individual therapy, especially in paediatrics, and an instrumental assay method has become {{necessary for the}} quality control of dosage units. The aim of this work {{was to develop a}} rapid, effective high-performance liquid chromatography method to assay <b>aminophenazone</b> in extemporaneous suppositories prepared with two different suppository bases, adeps solidus and massa macrogoli. With a novel sample preparation method developed by the authors, 4 -dimethylaminoantipyrine was determined in these suppository bases with 95 - 105 % recovery. The measurements were carried out on a Shimadzu Prominence ultra high-performance liquid chromatography system equipped with a 20 ΅l sample loop. The separation was achieved on a Hypersil ODS column, with methanol, sodium acetate buffer (pH 5. 5 ± 0. 05, 0. 05 M, 60 : 40, v/v) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1. 5 ml/min. The chromatograms were acquired at 253 nm. The chromatographic method was fully validated in accordance with current guidelines.

40|$|Background: Menopause is {{a natural}} event in the ageing process and signifies the end of {{reproductive}} years with cessation of cyclic ovarian function as manifested by cyclic menstruation. Lipid profile is altered in menopause because of various reasons. Objectives: The study was aimed to compare the lipid profile in women with normal body mass index (BMI) = 18. 9 - 24. 9 and women with BMI = 25 - 29. 9 in both pre- and post-menopausal group. Materials and Methods: Estimation of total cholesterol (TC) by CHOD-PAP Cholesterol Oxidase - Peroxidase + <b>Aminophenazone</b> + Phenol method, triglyceride (TG) by enzymatic calorimetric method, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) phosphotungstic acid method, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) by using Friedewald formula and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) was done by using the formula -VLDL = TG/ 5 in 30 women selected in each group. Results: Our study revealed that serum levels of TC, TG and LDL-C were significantly higher in post-menopausal women in comparison to their pre-menopausal counterparts, irrespective of BMI (P < 0. 05). Similarly, HDL-C levels were significantly lower in post-menopausal women as compared with pre-menopausal women of similar BMI (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: We found that serum levels of TC, TG and LDL-C were significantly higher in post-menopausal women in comparison to their pre-menopausal counterparts, irrespective of BMI. Similarly, HDL-C levels were significantly lower in post-menopausal women as compared to pre-menopausal women of similar BMI. Since we found similar changes in women of different BMIs, the difference in hormonal status is the probable cause of altered lipid profile. Hence, all post-menopausal women irrespective of body weight and BMI should be strongly counseled to have proper physical exercise and dietary habits to avoid the possible cardiovascular complications...|$|E
40|$|Medication-overuse {{headaches}} {{were first}} {{detected in the}} ‘ 80 s and since then considerable knowledge has been acquired about them. An important tool for this progress has been {{the introduction of the}} classification of the International Headache Society, which has included Medication-Overuse Headache (MOH) among secondary headache forms in the 2 nd edition of 2004 [1]. Furthermore, the severity of medication-overuse headaches has decreased with years, also {{as a consequence of the}} new drugs available for acute headache treatment. At the end of the ‘ 80 s, the most used drugs by patients coming to the Headache Centre of Modena were combinations of caffeine, butalbital, and ergotamine (Cafergot PB); amobarbital, paracetamol, and codeine (Lonarid); caffeine, metamizole, codeine, and chlormezanone (Eblimon); caffeine, propyphenazone, and ethylmorphine (Mindol Merck); caffeine, <b>aminophenazone,</b> and ergotamine (Virdex). All these analgesic combinations contained active principles which could often cause both overuse/abuse, as in the case of barbiturates, and organic damages, as in the case of ergot derivatives. Today it is much rarer to have patients using every day large and toxic quantities of analgesic combinations. The most common case is instead frequent or daily use of therapeutic dosages of triptans [2]. Even if it has been remarked that triptan overuse may increase migraine frequency sooner than other medications [3], in our experience, these drugs are often the only effective ones for acute treatment in chronic migraine patients. The present real cases of overuse concern almost only analgesic combinations still containing barbiturates or the combination of indomethacin, prochlorperazine, and caffeine. In spite of progress, there are still various sectors to improve and goals to reach. We think that the first one is prevention. In order to fully achieve it, we need first of all more effective and tolerated prophylactic treatments, specific for these patients. The second one is optimal ways of handling the most critical patients suffering from chronic headache, analgesic overuse, comorbidity, and organic complications. There are no guidelines to manage these patients, since studies published in literature are so heterogeneous that they do not allow comparing results and coming to strictly evidence-based conclusions. In this situation, recommendations based on experts’ consensus should at least be given, stressing that also minimal goals are important in the treatment of critical patients, such as: reducing the risks of organic damages deriving from analgesic overuse, reducing the frequency of use and/or the quantity overused, and hindering progressive worsening by periodic hospitalization. Experts’ intervention could also make these patients’ hospitalization easier. Chronic headache and analgesic overuse patients’ hospitalization is often fundamental, but hindered by hospital chief executives, since deriving DRG are not very remunerative. Finally, we must consider that growing attention is paid to chronic pain and people are more conscious of the disability associated to migraine. In this context, the conditions of a large number of patients that we are not able to treat should at least be recognised as disabling.

40|$|Die vorliegende Arbeit hatte die Aufgabe, die humane Hepatomzellinie Hep G 2 hinsichtlich ihrer Biotransformationskapazität zu charakterisieren, um Aussagen über ihre Eignung als in vitro-Testsystem treffen zu können. Dazu wurden die Aktivitäten und die Induzierbarkeit von unterschiedlichen Cytochrom P 450 Isoenzymen (CYP) bestimmt und mit Aktivitäten von isolierten Hepatozyten der Wistarratte verglichen. Als Vertreter der Phase II-Reaktionen wurde die Konjugierung von p-Nitrophenol untersucht. Hep G 2 -Zellen enthielten detektierbare CYP 1 A 1 und 2 -Aktivitäten, was mit Hilfe des 7 -Ethoxyresorufin- und des 7 -Ethoxycoumarin-Assays festgestellt werden konnte. Die Enzymaktivitäten waren durch 3 -Methylcholanthren und Phenobarbital induzierbar. Die Umsatzraten waren höher als in Monolayerkulturen von Rattenhepatozyten. Die Umsatzraten der Azoreduktion von 4 -(N,N-Dimethylamino) azobenzen waren in Hep G 2 -Zellen ebenfalls höher als in Hepatozyten der Wistarratte. Hep G 2 -Zellen zeigten sich hinsichtlich der Demethylierung von Aminophenazon, katalysiert durch CYP 3 A 1 und 2, und der Konjugierung von p-Nitrophenol den Rattenhepatozyten unterlegen. Die Konjugierung war durch 3 -Methylcholanthren und Phenobarbital induzierbar. Des weiteren wurde die Biotransformation von 3 potentiellen Arzneistoffen in Hep G 2 -Kulturen untersucht. Dabei handelte es sich um AWD 100 - 041 (3 -(2 -Mercaptoethyl) chinazolin- 2, 4 (1 H, 3 H) -dion), AR 12463 (5 -Piperidino- 7 -[N-pentyl-N (ß-hydroxyethyl) ]amino-s-triazolo(1, 5 a) -pyrimidin) und dem Lipoxygenaseinhibitor FLM 5011 (2 -Hydroxy- 5 -methyllaurophenon -oxim). In allen drei Fällen wurden zwar die gleichen Hauptmetaboliten wie in Rattenhepatozyten gebildet, die Umsatzraten waren aber wesentlich geringer. Um die Toxizität dieser drei Verbindungen und die von Solanum lycopersicon- Mazeraten zu untersuchen, wurde der Proteingehalt und der DNA-Gehalt mit Hilfe von Amidoschwarz bzw. bisBenzimid der Kulturen bestimmt. Membranschäden wurden durch den LDH Cytotoxicity Test von Boehringer Mannheim detektiert. Unter anderem konnte gezeigt werden, daß die Toxizität von FLM 5011 in Hep G 2 -Zellen auf die Induktion apoptotischer Prozesse zurückzuführen ist, welche durch die sinkende Konzentration von 5 (S) -Hydroxyeikosatetraensäure in der Zelle ausgelöst wird. Insgesamt stellen Hep G 2 -Zellen ein brauchbares in vitro-Modell für Biotransformations- und Zytotoxizitätsuntersuchungen dar. This {{investigations}} had {{the intention}} to characterise the capacity of biotransformation of the human hepatoblastoma- derived cell line Hep G 2 and to draw conclusions about its suitability as in vitro-model. The enzyme activities and inducabilities of cytochrome P 450 isoenzymes (CYP) as phase I reactions were measured and compared with the activity of monolayer primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. As a phase II-reaction the conjugation of p-nitrophenol was examined. Hep G 2 contained detectable activities of CYP 1 A 1 and 2 measured by the 7 -ethoxyresorufin assay and the 7 -ethoxycoumarin assay and which were inducable by 3 -methylcholanthrene and phenobarbitone. The turnover was higher than in rat hepatocytes. Also reductive activities, detected by the azoreduction of 4 -(N,N-dimethylamino) - azobenzene, had a higher level than rat hepatocytes. Hep G 2 cells were inferior compared to rat hepatocytes concerning the demethylation of <b>aminophenazone</b> catalysed by CYP 3 A 1 and 2 and the conjugation of p-nitrophenol. The latter was highly inducable by phenobarbitone. The biotransformation of the three active substances AWD 100 - 041 (3 -(2 -mercaptoethyl) chinazoline- 2, 4 (1 H, 3 H) -dione), AR 12463 (5 -piperidino- 7 -[N- pntyl-N (ß-hydroxyethyl) ]amino-s-triazolo[1, 5 a) -pyrimidin) and the lipoxygenase-inhibitor FLM 5011 (2 -hydroxy- 5 - methyllaurophenone-oxim) in Hep G 2 cell were also examined. In all cases the major metabolites {{were the same as}} in rat hepatocytes but the turnover was much lower than in rat hepatocytes. To study the toxicity of these three compounds and of Solanum lycopersicon mazerates the protein and the DNA content of the Hep G 2 cultures were measured with amido black and bisbenzimid respectively. Membrane damages were detected by the LDH Cytotoxicity Test of Boehringer Mannheim. It could be proved that the toxicity of FLM 5011 is due to apoptotic activities aroused by the down regulation of 5 -(S) hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Hep G 2 cells are a useful model for assessing the metabolism and toxicity of xenobiotics...|$|E
