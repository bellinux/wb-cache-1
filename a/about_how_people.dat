There should, however, be a correlation between how someone scores on the scale and how they behave, and the general hypothesis is that moral behaviour is more responsible, consistent and predictable from people at higher levels.|$|E

If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E

This theme, along with the passing of the torch, was influenced by Araki's grandfather's death near the start of the serialization, and his thoughts <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> leave parts of themselves behind for the next generation when they die.|$|E
500|$|During {{her time}} at Chanhassen, Adams acted {{in her first}} filma {{black-and-white}} short satire named The Chromium Hook. Soon after, while she was off work nursing a pulled muscle, she attended the locally held auditions for the Hollywood film Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999), a satire on beauty pageants starring Kirsten Dunst, Ellen Barkin, and Kirstie Alley. Adams was cast in the supporting part of a promiscuous cheerleader. She felt that her character's personality was far removed from her own and worried <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> would perceive her. The production was filmed locally, which enabled Adams to shoot for her role while also performing Brigadoon on stage. Encouragement from Alley prompted Adams to actively pursue a film career, and she moved to Los Angeles in January 1999. She described her initial experience in the city as [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "bleak", and she pined for her life back in Chanhassen.|$|E
500|$|Writing in The Observer in January 2014, Nick Mirsky, head of documentaries at Channel 4, {{said that}} Love Productions {{intentionally}} selected {{an area where}} {{a high proportion of}} the residents were in receipt of welfare payments [...] "to show the effect of benefit cuts on a community for whom they were the principal source of income". The filming and production process took eighteen months. Both Mirsky, and Ralph Lee, Channel 4's head of factual programming, said the residents of James Turner Street were consulted about the series before filming began. Cameras observed them {{over the course of a}} twelve-month period. The decision to call the series Benefits Street was taken two weeks before the programme aired. The comedian Frank Skinner, who is from the West Midlands, was approached to narrate the documentary but turned it down because he had concerns <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> from Birmingham would be portrayed, and did not wish to criticise the city. The voice-over was provided by former Coronation Street actor Tony Hirst instead.|$|E

500|$|The live {{performance}} that was uploaded to YouTube was captured at the Gold Country Casino in Orville, California on May 30, 2007. The song was, at the time, unreleased and was performed using banjos and violins and contained different lyrics than the album version. [...] "Sparks Fly" [...] was the opening {{song of the}} Speak Now World Tour. The performance begins with an opening montage <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> should [...] "speak now" [...] about how they feel, and Swift then raises from {{a cloud of smoke}} and sings [...] "Drop everything now" [...] before starting the actual song performance. Swift also uses a longer interlude into the final chorus of the song. Fireworks were also used during the performance. The performance uses electric guitars instead of banjos and was released on Swift's first live album, Speak Now World Tour Live. In his review of Speak Now World Tour Live, Matt Bjorke of Roughstock cited Swift's perforation of [...] "Sparks Fly" [...] a standout during the concert. Swift has also performed the song at the CMA Music Festival. Before beginning the performance Swift walked through the crowd to the stage and began singing.|$|E
500|$|... "Trust" [...] was {{released}} as the record's lead single. The song was developed from [...] "Absolution", an instrumental track recorded on a demo during the studio sessions {{of their previous}} album. [...] "Trust" [...] peaked at number five on the US Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks, thus becoming the band's highest charting song on that chart. It was nominated for [...] "Best Metal Performance" [...] at the 1998 Grammy Awards. [...] "Almost Honest" [...] was the second single of the album, and like its predecessor, it managed to enter the Top 10 on Billboards Mainstream Rock Chart. Mustaine stated that the song is <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> treat one another, which contains a message that [...] "it's {{difficult for people to}} be honest". Billboards Chuck Taylor commented that the song contains catchy hooks and the band's [...] "signature guitar howl" [...] and classified it [...] "somewhere between Def Leppard and Bon Jovi". [...] "Use the Man" [...] and [...] "A Secret Place" [...] were released as the third and fourth single, respectively. [...] "Use the Man" [...] (which started with a snippet of The Searchers' [...] "Needles and Pins", which was removed in the 2004 remaster) is about drug addiction, while [...] "A Secret Place" [...] describes losing touch with reality.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the lyrics}} were {{composed}} by Batmanglij and Koenig in Batmanglij's apartment (a former factory building in Brooklyn) and at a rented cottage on Martha's Vineyard. The lyrics explore more mature, world-weary themes such as growing old and disillusionment with American foreign policy. The album eschewed the theme of privileged youth from their first two albums in favor of characters with adult responsibilities and reflections on the passage of time. Faith and mortality are recurring themes on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", [...] "Worship You", and [...] "Everlasting Arms". Koenig likened their first three albums to Brideshead Revisited: [...] "The na√Øve joyous school days in the beginning. Then {{the expansion of the}} world, travel, seeing other places, learning a little bit more <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> live. And then the end {{is a little bit of}} growing up, starting to think more seriously about your life and your faith. If people could look at our three albums as a bildungsroman, I‚Äôd be O.K. with that." [...] According to Brice Ezell from PopMatters, Modern Vampires of the City is [...] "very much an indie rock record" [...] because of Koenig's voice and diction, which reveals [...] "the youth that he and his bandmates so often strive to shrug off." [...] Ezell asserts that, on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", the [...] "reckless abandon" [...] expressed by the lyrics reveals [...] "the group's grasp on the genuine rebellion that indie rock ought to strive for." ...|$|E

[...] "Is She the Reason" [...] is an R ballad which was noted to have a similar chord progression to materials by The Beatles, which lyrically speaks on being in competition with another woman for her mans love & attention. It contains a trumpet-laden sample from Melba Moore's song [...] "I Don't Know No One Else to Turn To". The next song, [...] "Girl" [...] was noted for its Motown influence and a theme talking about friendship. [...] "If", complete with strings, lyrically talks about men who don't appreciate their female lovers until their relationship ends and they realize their mistakes.

The midtempo number [...] "Through with Love" [...] was noted for having an [...] "angry" [...] nature as it talks about a break-up.

Based on research in a diversified neighbourhood in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, this paper shows that people's life courses and daily mobility interrelate to bring about senses of belongingness. Life courses and daily activities converge during encounters to influence a relational differentiation of Self and others that leads to varying senses of belongingness, including exclusion. This situational process represents the plurality and dynamism of, and structuration, in diversified society. Because of societal plurality and dynamism, a research and policy focus on cohesion rather than belongingness might be undue...|$|R
