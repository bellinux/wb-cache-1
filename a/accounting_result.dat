50|$|The growth {{accounting}} procedure proceeds as follows. First is calculated the growth {{rates for the}} output and the inputs by dividing the Period 2 numbers with the Period 1 numbers. Then the weights of inputs are computed as input shares of the total input (Period 1). Weighted growth rates (WG) are obtained by weighting growth rates with the weights. The <b>accounting</b> <b>result</b> is obtained by subtracting the weighted growth rates of the inputs from {{the growth rate of}} the output. In this case the <b>accounting</b> <b>result</b> is 0.015 which implies a productivity growth by 1.5%.|$|E
5000|$|Growth {{accounting}} {{can also}} be expressed {{in the form of}} the arithmetical model, which is used here because it is more descriptive and understandable. The principle of the accounting model is simple. The weighted growth rates of inputs (factors of production) are subtracted from the weighted growth rates of outputs. Because the <b>accounting</b> <b>result</b> is obtained by subtracting it is often called a [...] "residual". The residual is often defined as the growth rate of output not explained by the share-weighted growth rates of the inputs.|$|E

50|$|The dual {{approach}} has been recognized in growth accounting for long but its interpretation has remained unclear. The following question has remained unanswered: “Quantity based estimates of the residual are interpreted as {{a shift in the}} production function, but what is the interpretation of the price-based growth estimates?” We have demonstrated above that the real income change is achieved by quantitative changes in production and the income distribution change to the stakeholders is its dual. In this case the duality means that the same <b>accounting</b> <b>result</b> is obtained by accounting the change of the total income generation (real income) and by accounting the change of the total income distribution.|$|E
50|$|The <b>{{accounting}}</b> <b>result</b> of {{the growth}} accounting model is expressed as an index number, in this example 1.015, which depicts the average productivity change. As demonstrated above we cannot draw correct conclusions based on average productivity numbers. This {{is due to the}} fact that productivity is accounted as an independent variable separated from the entity it belongs to, i.e. real income formation. Hence, if we compare in a practical situation two growth accounting results of the same production process we do not know which one is better in terms of production performance. We have to know separately income effects of productivity change and production volume change or their combined income effect in order to understand which one result is better and how much better.|$|E

In return, Amedeo Calliari and Nicolò Brighenti also signed by Triestina in co-ownership deal, for €325,000 and €425,000 respectively. Thus, the swap deal only involved €10,000 from Chievo to Triestina. D'Ambrosio and Cottafava then returned to Triestina on loan and Brighenti and Calliari were loaned to Lega Pro. The deal made Triestina received a player profit of €840,000 and €620,000 respectively, despite it was false, as the club received nothing but two youth players with speculative potential.

The <b>accounting</b> <b>result</b> management deviates from the accounting principles (honesty, regularity and faithful image) and finds its motivations in the contractual relations between the managers and stakeholders. This is in the legal, not more frame. The appreciation of accounting information players is different, their interests are different. Therefore, the flexibility of accounting rules allowed to the managers is opportunistic. The accounting representation cannot be completely objective, it is more or less subjective, but the freedom of judgment should be based on a high level of ethical sensibility. The ethical side in accounting has something to say about the result management, it allows the result to offer a faithful image. ...|$|E
