5|$|At 4/189 Loxton {{came in to}} join Harvey, who {{continued}} to attack the bowling, unperturbed by Miller's demise. Ken Cranston came on to bowl and Harvey square drove and then hooked to deep square leg for consecutive boundaries. Yardley then moved <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> fine leg to where the hook had gone; Harvey responded by glancing a ball to the fielder's former position, collecting three more runs. Australia thus went to lunch at 4/204, with Harvey on 70.|$|E

5|$|Loxton {{came in to}} join Harvey at 189/4, who {{continued}} attacking, unperturbed by Miller's departure. Cranston came on and Harvey square drove and then hooked to deep square leg for two consecutive boundaries. Yardley moved <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> fine leg to the location where the previous hook had gone; Harvey responded by glancing a ball to where the fine leg fielder had been, collecting three more runs. Australia thus went to lunch at 204/4, with Harvey on 70.|$|E

5|$|Romualdo Braschi-Onesti, cardinal-nephew of Pius VI (1775–1799), was the {{penultimate}} cardinal-nephew. Despite Pius VI's lineage to a noble Cesena family, {{his only}} sister had married <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> the poor Onesti family. Therefore, he commissioned a genealogist to discover (and inflate) some trace of nobility in the Onesti lineage, an endeavor which yielded only a circuitous connection to Saint Romualdo.|$|E
5|$|The game follows Hawk, an amnesic Valhalla gladiator who trains at {{his mentor}} Okamoto's gym. Among other {{recurring}} characters are Hiroko, a rebellious temple knight; Beth, {{a woman from}} the center who vows to always stay by Hawk's side; Daleth, who {{claims to be the}} Messiah, and fights Hawk multiple times; Zayin, a temple knight; and Gimmel, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> the Arcadia forest, who knows Hawk from somewhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of a large, unusual creature in Muskrat Lake {{has been the subject}} of anecdotes since 1916. The creature's name was originally cited as Hapyxelor, alternately spelled Hapaxelor, but changed simply to Mussie, short for The Monster of Muskrat Lake, sometime later. Humphries, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> Cobden, was a well-known proponent of Mussie's existence. Around the area, many people's knowledge of the creature come from his vehement, albeit inconsistent, tales of observing it once.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> Glastonbury {{is engaged}} to a girl from Wookey. A witch living in Wookey Hole Caves curses the romance so that it fails. The man, now a monk, seeks revenge on this witch who—having been jilted herself—frequently spoils budding relationships. The monk stalks the witch into the cave and she hides in a dark corner {{near one of the}} {{underground}} rivers. The monk blesses the water and splashes some of it at the dark parts of the cave where the witch was hiding. The blessed water immediately petrifies the witch, and she remains in the cave to this day.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> Northern Ireland was {{discussed}} in the media {{in connection with the}} disappearance. After being released from prison for the sexual assault of his four daughters, he had moved to Carvoeiro, Portugal, not far from Praia da Luz, and was there when Madeleine went missing. He died in 2013. Another focus of Operation Grange was Urs Hans von Aesch, a deceased Swiss man implicated in the 2007 murder, in Switzerland, of five-year-old Ylenia Lenhard. Ylenia disappeared on 31 July 2007, nearly three months after Madeleine, and was found dead in September as a result of toluene poisoning. Von Aesch was living in Spain when Madeleine disappeared.|$|E

5|$|Four locals {{had been}} {{identified}} by the committee as witnessing Cornfoot being killed and being involved in her mistreatment although the three main perpetrators, who had by then left the area, were an Orcadian, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> Burntisland and a Sea captain's son. A schoolboy, two Englishmen and another person were also implicated but had absconded. The committee determined that Bailie Cook, whose residence the mob had seized Cornfoot from, should carry {{a significant amount of}} the blame. Four males suspected of being present at the murder were held in custody but were released by Cowper in defiance of the Privy Council's instruction for them to be taken to Edinburgh for trial.|$|E
5|$|In Celtic folklore, {{the bird}} {{appears on the}} {{shoulder}} of the dying Cú Chulainn, and could also be a manifestation of the Morrígan, the wife of Tethra, or the Cailleach. This idea has persisted, and the hooded crow is associated with fairies in the Scottish highlands and Ireland; in the 18th century, Scottish shepherds would make offerings to them to keep them from attacking sheep. In Faroese folklore, a maiden would go out on Candlemas morn and throw a stone, then a bone, then a clump of turf at a hooded crow – if it flew over the sea, her husband would be a foreigner; if it landed on a farm or house, she would marry <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> there, but if it stayed put, she would remain unmarried.|$|E
5|$|In each {{of these}} assignments, Hotze proved himself as a {{confident}} and courageous general against the stronger French Army of the Moselle. In recognition, {{he was promoted to}} Feldmarschall-leutnant, a rank unusual for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> a non-aristocratic family. He was also raised to the rank of baron (Freiherr) by Emperor Francis II. In the campaign of 1795, he served again under the command of Wurmser; his troops secured Rhineland positions near Mannheim, and later took part in engagements at Edighofen and Kaiserslautern.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Alison and Diana Gordon {{are being}} held captive in their home by Zep, who is {{watching}} Adam and Lawrence through a camera behind a two-way mirror in the bathroom. The house is simultaneously being watched by Tapp, who has since been discharged from the force. Flashbacks show that Tapp became obsessed with the Jigsaw case after hearing Amanda's testimony, and eventually found Jigsaw's warehouse using the videotape from her game. He and Sing entered the warehouse, where they apprehended Jigsaw and saved <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> a drill trap, but Jigsaw escaped after non-fatally slashing Tapp's throat, and Sing {{was killed by a}} quadruple shotgun walkway while pursuing him. Convinced that Lawrence is Jigsaw, Tapp began stalking him after his discharge.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the people}} to whom Jenner posed his {{question}} was Noel Stanton, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> Bedfordshire, England, who was serving in Sydney with the Royal Navy at the time. Stanton became preoccupied with the memory of this meeting for several months afterwards and, the next year, became a committed Christian. Stanton went on to found the Jesus Army in Northampton, England, in 1969. In 1945, Jenner approached Norrie Jeffs, who had just returned from participating in Operation Meridian at Palembang on Sumatra, and, having asked Jeffs his question, Jeffs responded that he was already a Christian. Jenner then invited Jeffs over to his house, where Jeffs met several other visitors, including the woman who would later become his wife. In 1952, another person Jenner accosted with his question on George Street was Ian Boyden, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> Roseville who was serving in the Royal Australian Air Force. After having a brief conversation with Jenner, Boyden accepted Jenner's invitation to attend a church service at Renwick Gospel Hall, where he responded to the sermon by committing to living as a Christian thenceforward, which he did for at least fifty years. Many other people who had a brief encounter with Jenner on the street in Sydney also became Christians, but Jenner did not realise that any {{of the people}} he accosted had remained a Christian beyond their initial profession of faith until 1953, when Francis Dixon told him the stories of several such people.|$|E
5|$|The series' central {{characters}} are Lightning, a former soldier and the core character {{in all three}} games; Serah Farron, Lightning's sister and the second game's main protagonist; Snow Villiers, an optimistic young man engaged to Serah; Hope Estheim, {{a young man who}} develops a strong bond with Lightning; Sazh Katzroy, a former airship pilot; Oerba Dia Vanille and Oerba Yun Fang, two women who inadvertently set the first game's events in motion. Three further characters appear in XIII-2: Noel Kreiss, a hunter who sets out to change his bleak future; Caius Ballad, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> Noel's past who wishes to bring about a predestined apocalypse; and Paddra Nsu-Yeul, a seeress reincarnated through history. In Lightning Returns, two more are added: Lumina, a doppelganger of Serah; and Bhunivelze, the main deity of the Final Fantasy XIII universe.|$|E

5|$|The {{subtropical}} storm spawned twelve tornadoes across Florida, {{including at}} least 2 tornadoes which reached a magnitude of F2 on the Fujita Scale. The first tornado formed in Hendry County on June 18 at 0115UTC reaching F2 strength. The third fatality was <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> Hendry County {{who was killed in}} his mobile home, which was destroyed by a tornado. A total of twenty-five homes in Florida were destroyed. Total damage in Florida totaled out to $10million (1982USD, $21million 2007USD).|$|E
5|$|Fatalities {{associated}} with Myrmecia stings are well known, {{and have been}} attested to by multiple sources. In 1931 two adults and an infant girl from New South Wales died from ant stings, possibly from M. pilosula or M. pyriformis. Another fatality was reported in 1963 in Tasmania. Between 1980 and 2000, there were six recorded deaths, five in Tasmania and one in New South Wales. Four of these deaths were due to M. pilosula, while the remaining two died from a M. pyriformis sting. Half of the victims had known ant-sting allergies, but {{only one of the}} victims was carrying adrenaline before being stung. Most victims died within 20 minutes of being stung, but one of the victims died in just five minutes from a M. pyriformis sting. No death has been officially recorded since 2003, but M. pilosula may have been {{responsible for the death of}} <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> Bunbury in 2011. Prior to the establishment of a desensitisation program, Myrmecia stings caused one fatality every four years.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel is {{sent by the}} Brotherhood of Light to the Lake of Oblivion, {{where his}} {{deceased}} wife, Marie, tells him that Spirits who founded the Brotherhood said that the Lords of Shadow's power will save the world. Gabriel meets <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>from</b> the Brotherhood called Zobek, who states that a prophecy has been kept a secret by a select few, which tells of a pure-hearted warrior who will claim the Lords of Shadow's power to overcome evil. Zobek says that he and Gabriel must enter the lands of the Dark Lords in order to unite the Heavens with the world again, and that with this Gabriel can bring Marie back from the dead. Gabriel defeats the werewolf Cornell (Richard Ridings) and the vampire Carmilla (Sally Knyvette) {{for the first two}} pieces of the God Mask on his journey, while learning that they were once two of the three founding members of the Order who fought the spawns of Satan in God's favor until they transformed into the Spirits, with power only second to God's. After they ascended to the Heavens, they left behind their dark sides, who were known as the Lords of Shadow.|$|E
