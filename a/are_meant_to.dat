About 70% of the radiation from neighboring Ukraine's 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster entered Belarusian territory, and {{about a fifth of}} Belarusian land (principally farmland and forests in the southeastern regions) was affected by radiation fallout. The United Nations and other agencies have aimed to reduce the level of radiation in affected areas, especially through the use of caesium binders and rapeseed cultivation, which <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> decrease soil levels of caesium-137.|$|E

Her children's works have won three Adhikarya Awards from the Indonesian Publishers Association, and LGBT groups have praised her novel Gerhana Kembar (Twin Eclipse; 2007) for avoiding stereotyping the group.

Additionally, both the gameplay and the plot <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> give a glimpse about what the following title in the series, Kingdom Hearts III, will be like.

5|$|Cinema audiences {{could wear}} {{disposable}} polarized glasses {{to view the}} film, creating the illusion that elements from the film were penetrating the screen to come towards the viewers. The opening sequence makes obvious use of the technique, with the titles flying {{to the forefront of}} the screen, leaving a trail. There are more subtle instances in the film where props <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> leave the screen. The more obvious examples are in the climactic sequence of the shark attacking the control room and its subsequent destruction. The glass as the shark smashes into the room uses 3D, as does the shot where the shark explodes, with fragmented parts of it apparently bursting through the screen, ending with its jaws. There were many difficulties in making the green screen compositing work in 3D, and a lot of material had to be reshot.|$|E

5|$|Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River {{are both}} open for fishing. The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) has {{established}} fishing regulations, such as catch and length limits, that <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> enhance sport fisheries in public waters such as Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River.

The regulations specify that anglers may keep largemouth bass that are greater than 20inches (50.8cm) or between 14 and 16inches (35.6-40.6cm). This rule {{was put in place}} {{to increase the number of}} tropy fish, fish over 20inches (50.8cm).

Nessarose is delighted and tells her sister how she and Boq <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> be together and how Galinda helped it happen. When Galinda offers Elphaba a hat to wear to the party, Elphaba begins to wonder if she was wrong about her roommate.|$|E

50|$|This {{struggle}} {{eventually led}} to the point on the timeline occupied by the book called Ascension. While the entire metaplot has always <b>been</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> altered as each play group sees fit, Ascension provided multiple possible endings, with none of them being definitive (though one <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> resolve the metaplot). Thus, there is no definitive canonical ending.
