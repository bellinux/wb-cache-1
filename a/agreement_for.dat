5|$|Beginning {{with the}} rapid {{industrial}} growth that began in Indiana during the gas boom of the late 19th-century, labor unions began to form with goals of increasing wages and providing other benefits to workers through collective bargaining. The Indianapolis Traction and Terminal Company was founded to own and operate the streetcar terminal in downtown Indianapolis, and operate the Indianapolis Street Railway under a lease <b>agreement</b> <b>for</b> a term of 31 years. In 1892 the employees of Indianapolis Traction and Terminal Company launched a short-lived strike. The company was the primary public transportation provider in Indianapolis and operated the central transportation hub {{for the city of}} Indianapolis and state of Indiana. The company offered small concessions, and the workers returned to work without unionizing.|$|E
5|$|Butlin's, {{the holiday}} camp giant {{purchased}} No. 46229 Duchess of Hamilton following {{the withdrawal of}} this locomotive in February 1964 and it was put {{on display at the}} Minehead holiday camp. In 1975, following a slow deterioration due to the Minehead's salty atmosphere and the looming maintenance costs, Butlin's signed a twenty-year loan <b>agreement</b> <b>for</b> it to be taken under the wing of the National Railway Museum. In 1976, following a cosmetic overhaul, No. 46229 was put on static display in the museum's York premises. In due course a fundraising appeal allowed an overhaul to take place as a precursor to letting the locomotive operate on the national rail network once more.|$|E

Fan support of the team's games {{is expected to be}} a factor in Nashville's bid for a Major League Soccer (MLS) expansion franchise. If the city was to be awarded an MLS team, First Tennessee Park would not be a viable location as the league requires soccer-specific stadiums for new franchises. Instead, the team would play at a new stadium, such as the 30,000-seat facility proposed for the Nashville Fairgrounds. Nashville SC is expected to play its first home game as early as March 2018.|$|E
