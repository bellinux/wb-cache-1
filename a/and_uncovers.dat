2500|$|Readers first {{discover}} why Hagrid {{was expelled}} from Hogwarts in the second novel. It is revealed that Hagrid {{was a student at}} Hogwarts {{at the same time as}} Tom Marvolo Riddle, the wizard who later became Lord Voldemort. Hagrid was expelled during his third year, after being caught in the company of Aragog, a dangerous acromantula: this already serious crime seemed worse than it was, due to the belief that the acromantula was [...] "The Monster of Slytherin," [...] and that Hagrid had released it from the Chamber of Secrets and allowed it to attack students. Aragog escapes into the dark forest and starts a colony of spiders. The belief of Hagrid's guilt was encouraged by Tom Riddle, the actual criminal, who had been using the true monster (a basilisk) to attack students, and who had framed Hagrid to prevent the school from being closed, because he didn't want to return to the orphanage. During the events of the second book, the Basilisk is unleashed once again and Hagrid is sent to the prison of Azkaban, as he is believed again to be responsible for the attacks. However, before being arrested, Hagrid tells Harry and Ron to [...] "follow the spiders", so that they can meet Aragog and discover the identity of the true monster. After Harry defeats the Basilisk <b>and</b> <b>uncovers</b> the truth, Hagrid is freed from prison.|$|E
2500|$|Althusser {{believes}} that Marx's work is fundamentally incompatible with its antecedents {{because it is}} built on a groundbreaking epistemology (theory of knowledge) that rejects the distinction between subject and object. In opposition to empiricism, Althusser claims that Marx's philosophy, dialectical materialism, counters the theory of knowledge as vision with a theory of knowledge as production. On the empiricist view, a knowing subject encounters a real object <b>and</b> <b>uncovers</b> its essence by means of abstraction. On the assumption that thought has a direct engagement with reality, or an unmediated vision of a [...] "real" [...] object, the empiricist {{believes that}} the truth of knowledge lies in the correspondence of a subject's thought to an object that is external to thought itself. By contrast, Althusser claims to find latent in Marx's work a view of knowledge as [...] "theoretical practice". For Althusser, theoretical practice takes place entirely {{within the realm of}} thought, working upon theoretical objects and never coming into direct contact with the real object that it aims to know. Knowledge is not discovered, but rather produced by way of three [...] "Generalities": (1) the [...] "raw material" [...] of pre-scientific ideas, abstractions and facts; (2) a conceptual framework (or [...] "problematic") brought to bear upon these; and (3) the finished product of a transformed theoretical entity, concrete knowledge. In this view, the validity of knowledge does not lie in its correspondence to something external to itself; because Marx's historical materialism is a science, it contains its own internal methods of proof. It is therefore not governed by interests of society, class, ideology, or politics, and is distinct from the superstructure.|$|E

They realize that Henry is their only hope, since Regina can't restore the bean before they are all consumed. When Henry arrives at the Mayor's office with Hrunting, Emma arrives out of nowhere. She tells Henry that while she doesn't remember being who Henry tells her she is, but she does believe that she can be that person with his help. Her renewed belief stops the destruction of the Enchanted Forest just in time to save the others. The Darkness pulls back, revealing that everything in the Enchanted Forest Realm had been consumed, except for a small column of land that the group stands on. At the same time, Gold uses a tracking spell on [...] "Her Handsome Hero" [...] to find Belle, who was hiding from Fiona, and she hides from Gold as well, having been turned into a coward by Fiona's Curse.
