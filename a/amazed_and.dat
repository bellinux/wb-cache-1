5|$|The Mozart family grand {{tour was}} {{a journey through}} western Europe, {{undertaken}} by Leopold Mozart, his wife Anna Maria, and their musically gifted children Maria Anna (Nannerl) and Wolfgang Amadeus from 1763 to 1766. At {{the start of the}} tour the children were aged eleven and seven respectively. Their extraordinary skills had been demonstrated during a visit to Vienna in 1762, when they had played before the Empress Maria Theresa at the Imperial Court. Sensing the social and pecuniary opportunities that might accrue from a prolonged trip embracing the capitals and main cultural centres of Europe, Leopold obtained an extended leave of absence from his post as deputy Kapellmeister to the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. Throughout the subsequent tour, the children's Wunderkind status was confirmed as their precocious performances consistently <b>amazed</b> <b>and</b> gratified their audiences.|$|E

25|$|In October 2015, it was {{confirmed}} that The King of Fighters XIV would be directed by Yasuyuki Oda, the battle designer of Street Fighter IV, who previously worked for SNK R Division 1 which includes staff {{members from the}} Fatal Fury and the Art of Fighting series. This was his first contribution to the franchise, leading a younger staff. During Oda's first employment at SNK, games like Virtua Fighter <b>amazed</b> <b>and</b> motivated him to make a 3D game after his departure. When Oda returned to SNK, there were never any debates about making the series transition from 2D to 3D, though the adaption of some characters proved more difficult than others. The team received negative feedback to early trailers' visuals of the game. As a result, the company decided to improve them on it to please the fans.|$|E

His first flight lasted only one minute 45 seconds, but his ability to effortlessly make banking turns and fly a circle <b>amazed</b> <b>and</b> stunned onlookers, including several pioneer French aviators, among them Louis Blériot. In the following days, Wilbur made a series of technically challenging flights, including figure-eights, demonstrating his skills as a pilot and the capability of his flying machine, which far surpassed those of all other pioneering aircraft and pilots of the day.|$|E

500|$|One of the game's most {{critically}} acclaimed characters is Pagan Min, the game's major antagonist. The team hoped that players would be [...] "shocked, <b>amazed</b> <b>and</b> intrigued" [...] by him in every encounter. Min has a complex {{relationship with the}} playable character, Ghale, as the team wanted players to guess Min's intentions and add a layer of mystery to him. The team originally hoped to have a villain that had a [...] "punk-rock mentality", but the idea was abandoned as the team thought that the concept was not original. The pink costume Min wears throughout the game was inspired by Beat Takeshi, a character from Brothers, and Ichi, a character from Ichi the Killer. Min {{is designed to be}} sadistic yet confident, and the team hired Troy Baker to provide the voice for Min, as they thought that Baker's voice is charismatic enough to suit Min. According to Baker, Ubisoft gave him a script for the audition but he chose not to follow it, and instead decided to threaten to cut off the face of an assistant using Min's tone. The interviewer was very pleased with Baker's performance and decided to sign him for the job. As for Ghale, he was designed to be [...] "thin", and his backstory was designed to be revealed as players progressed through the game's story. According to the game's narrative director, Mark Thompson, Ghale learns the history and culture of Kyrat along with players. The developers also hoped that Ghale could be an accessible character for players.|$|E
500|$|During the war, an {{incident}} occurred involving the Prince George's County jail, when local resident Dr. William Beanes, (1775–1824) captured several marauding British Army deserters from the passing army of General General Robert Ross (1766–1814) and Vice Admiral, Sir George Cockburn, (1772–1853), {{and held them}} in the County Jail, after he had treated several wounded [...] "Redcoat" [...] soldiers in their march on to Washington and the disastrous Battle of Bladensburg on the Eastern Branch stream of the Anacostia River in August 1814. Later he was arrested along with several others including Robert Bowie, former 11th Governor of Maryland (1803–06, 1811–12) by retreating British cavalry on orders from Ross who had stayed in his home as headquarters. Later Francis Scott Key (1779–1843), a Georgetown and Frederick lawyer with Col. John S. Skinner, U.S. Prisoner-of-War and Parole Agent went to Baltimore secured a small sailing ship, the Minden, and sailed down the Patapsco River and the Chesapeake Bay to find the British Royal Navy fleet after leaving the Patuxent River, beating up the Bay from their base on Tangier Island, Virginia heading for their attack on the hated [...] "nest of pirates" [...] - Baltimore. After being received and negotiating with General Ross, Admiral Cockburn and their superior, Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, (1758–1832), and showing him some letters written by captured British wounded soldiers testifying to [...] the fair treatment Beanes had given them and tended to them, they agreed to free him {{but that would be}} held up until they could celebrate after the Burning of Baltimore following their attack on Fort McHenry and landing troops to the east at North Point. Well, the famous story has been told, how the general was killed prior to the skirmishing at the Battle of North Point on September 12, how the advancing British under successor, Colonel Arthur Brooke led the British regiments to face the 20,000 drafted and volunteer citizens and militia under the command of Major General Samuel Smith, (1752–1839), of the Maryland Militia on the eastern heights of [...] "Loudenschlager's Hill" [...] (later known as [...] "Hampstead Hill" [...] in modern Patterson Park, between Highlandtown and Canton neighborhoods) whose dug-in fortifications and dragged cannon were so numerous that the [...] "Redcoats" [...] halted in their tracks and decided to await the shelling of the fort which guarded the entrances to the Harbor to pass into the inner port and the waterfront of Fells Point. Following the failure of the fort to fall to two days of [...] "the rockets' red glare and the bombs bursting in air" [...] and their flanking troop-loaded barge attack around the west end but driven back by alert artillery seamen at Forts Covington and Babcock in a driving night rainstorm, the British fleet turned about and set sail. Key and his companions Beanes and Skinner who were startled, <b>amazed</b> <b>and</b> emotionally overcome [...] to see a huge 30 by 42 foot banner being raised {{in the light of the}} early morning with the distant booming of the morning's gun salute, knew that the fort and the city had held.
