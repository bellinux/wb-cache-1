According to Power, Williams met with his girlfriendFlorence Seymourafter the murder, and the two decided to bury the gun {{on the beach and}} send a letter to Williams' brother <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> to return to London, which was then given to Power. Power's motive in coming to the police was that {{he was in love with}} Seymour.|$|E

25|$|In {{his final}} years, Richardson {{received}} visits from Archbishop Secker, other important political figures, and many London writers. By that time, he enjoyed a high social position and was Master of the Stationers' Company. In early November 1754, Richardson {{and his family}} moved from the Grange to a home at Parsons Green. It was during this time that Richardson {{received a letter from}} Samuel Johnson <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> to pay for a debt that Johnson was unable to afford. On 16 March 1756, Richardson responded with more than enough money, and their friendship was certain by this time.|$|E
25|$|The {{son of a}} watchmaker, Spark had a {{literary}} education {{in his hometown of}} Elgin, learnt to speak and studied French, and acquired an interest in astronomy. In the June 1811, after he had had some experience in business, Spark went to London, where he became the founder of a small literary society. Despite himself, Spark found living on £50 a great difficulty, and opted to contact his parents for financial support. His father, at first reluctant to offer his son any sum of money to help him to deal with his sinking financial situation, gave him the money he requested only after Alexander had found a supply of low-priced watches {{and came up with a}} design for what Spark called a 'Patent Warning Clock', and not before lecturing Alexander about over-spending and the poor grammar and writing in the letter which Alexander had sent to his father <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E

In the experimental condition, people first heard a sentence saying that they would probably refuse to help, and then they were asked to make a donation. In the control condition, participants were just <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>money.</b> Findings showed that more participants complied with the request in the experimental condition.

25|$|In September 1978, {{the ship}} was sold to a Canadian man for use by Food for the Hungry International. Despite being sold to a Canadian owner, British Commonwealth {{agreements}} allowed the ship to retain Australian registry. After a boiler refit, the ship relocated to Singapore and began operating in the South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand, rescuing Vietnamese refugees from boats and transporting them to shore. Several {{countries in the region}} refused the ship entry, and the Australian government persuaded the owner to change the ship's registry, as {{they did not want to}} be held responsible for any refugees rescued by an Australian-flagged vessel not under their control. The ship was re-registered as a Panamian-flagged private yacht under the name Akuna II on 4 February 1980. Around this time, a former United States Air Force pilot claimed to have purchased the ship from Food for the Hungry, and that he was using it to rescue US prisoners-of-war that were still interred in Vietnam. The pilot mass-mailed letters to families of missing-in-action soldiers <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> to fund the rescue operations, but was later determined to be a money-making scam. Around the same time as the mass-mailing, the US government was informed that Akuna II was moored in Songkhla, having been there for about two years, with a two-man skeleton crew who lived aboard but knew nothing about how to operate or maintain the ship.|$|E

500|$|Aberdeen, {{a coastal}} city, gave Struthers the {{opportunity}} to observe the whales which were {{from time to time}} washed up on Scotland's coast. In 1870 he observed, dissected and described a Blue Whale (which he called a [...] "Great Fin-Whale") from Peterhead. He brought the entire skeleton of a sei whale back to the anatomy department at Aberdeen, where for a century it was suspended overhead in the hall. He vigorously collected examples {{of a wide range of}} species to form a museum of zoology, with the intention of illustrating Darwin's theories. As an energetic and forceful personality with a strong enthusiasm for zoology, he alarmed his colleagues at the University of Aberdeen by constantly <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> and space to acquire and house his collection.|$|E

500|$|A {{few days}} after the murder, a former medical student named Edgar Power {{contacted}} the police, showing them a letter that he claimed had been written by the murderer. It read [...] "If you would save my life come here at once to 4 Tideswell Road. Ask for Seymour. Bring some cash with you. Very Urgent." [...] Power told the police that the letter had been written by a friend of his called John Williams, who he claimed had visited Sztaray's house to burgle it before killing the policeman and fleeing. Williams then met with his girlfriend Florence Seymour and explained what had happened. The two decided to bury the gun on the beach and send a letter to Williams' brother <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> to return to London, which was then given to Powers.|$|E

Satirical impression series Dead Ringers referenced Wellard in a 2004 episode, running the continuity announcement: [...] "Later on ITV1, new drama featuring the latest EastEnders star we've {{signed up for a}} ridiculous advance. Yes Wellard the dog is Barker, a cop on the edge with a drink problem and distemper." [...] For Red Nose Day 2007, Aardman Animations created a Creature Comforts-style short featuring Wellard <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> for Comic Relief, along with selling his offspring and being put in prison.

500|$|The Amigoe {{newspaper}} reported {{on interviews with}} Julia Renfro and Dompig in which they said that Aruban authorities had been systematically obstructed in their investigation by U.S. officials. They also said that within a day of Holloway's being reported missing, a medjet, unauthorized by Aruban authorities, had arrived on Aruba and had remained for several days {{for the purpose of}} covertly taking Holloway off the island without notifying local authorities. Renfro, an American-born editor of an English-language daily, Aruba Today, who at the time of Holloway's disappearance had become close friends with Beth Twitty, also said she and Twitty {{received a phone call from}} an unknown woman on June 2, 2005, <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> in return for information about Holloway's location, and asserting that Holloway was unwilling to return to her mother. According to Renfro, she and another American went to a drug house where Holloway supposedly was, bringing money, but found that Jug Twitty had already been to the area, spreading [...] "a lot of uproar and panic in the direct vicinity," [...] and nothing could be accomplished. The Twittys disputed Renfro's accounts, Beth Twitty describing Renfro as [...] "a witch." ...|$|E

500|$|David Goodman comments, {{regarding}} the plot partially following Herbert that [...] "there {{is always a}} bit of trouble pitching a Herbert storyline to the network." [...] Samm Levine had originally been selected to voice Kyle, but the character was recast because, as show producer Seth MacFarlane comments, [...] "it seemed a lot funnier when Peter was beating up a kid if he was younger and more defenseless." [...] A deleted scene had been made which showed Chris <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> and stating [...] "I spent my last ten bucks on a ham costume," [...] and Peter replying with [...] "it's just sitting there right now, {{but you know what}} the great thing is, it's just three months until Halloween and I am done." [...] Peter's ancestor shown preparing to wrestle with a kangaroo was described by Seth MacFarlane to be [...] "a very strange gag," [...] which was added after the other parts of the episode had been created. Quagmire's profanity-laced tirade during the golf game was bleeped out on TV, but uncensored on DVD. The scene of Stewie remembering the time the Griffins had a nymphomaniac from Wisconsin in their attic was edited as FOX objected to the sounds of the woman having an orgasm being shown over a shot of a wide-awake Stewie.|$|E
500|$|The rumour {{was that}} Griselda Steevens' reclusiveness and always being veiled were owing to her having {{been born with}} a pig's head. Chambers (1864) speculates that her unusual name {{may have contributed to}} the legend, and notes the common belief that she was named [...] "Grisly" [...] on account of her {{appearance}} when born. It was claimed that while pregnant with Richard and Griselda, Steevens' mother had said [...] "take away your litter of pigs!" [...] to a woman beggar <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> to feed her children, and Griselda had then been born with the head and face of a pig. Dismayed by the popular belief that she had a pig's head, Griselda took to sitting on an open balcony to allow the public to see her face. This failed to stem the spread of the rumour, and she commissioned a portrait of herself to be hung in the main hall of the hospital. The portrait failed to have the desired effect; many of the public chose instead to believe a portrait in a pub neighbouring the hospital, which showed Steevens with a pig's head; the pub also displayed a silver trough alleged to have belonged to her. She eventually withdrew from public view completely before her death on 18 March 1746.|$|E
500|$|In another incident, eight {{witnesses}} {{reported the}} recapture {{of a young}} woman after an apparent escape attempt in September 1918 at a railway station at Siding 37, northwest of Perm. These witnesses were Maxim Grigoyev, Tatiana Sitnikova (and her son Fyodor Sitnikov), Ivan Kuklin and Matrina Kuklina, Vassily Ryabov, Ustinya Varankina, and Dr Pavel Utkin, a physician who treated the girl after the incident. Some of the witnesses identified the girl as Anastasia when they were shown photographs of the grand duchess by White Russian Army investigators. Utkin also told the White Russian Army investigators that the injured girl, whom he treated at Cheka headquarters in Perm, told him, [...] "I am the daughter of the ruler, Anastasia." [...] Utkin obtained a prescription from a pharmacy for a patient named [...] "N" [...] at the orders of the secret police. White Army investigators later independently located records for the prescription. During the same time period in mid-1918, there were several reports of young people in Russia passing themselves off as Romanov escapees. Boris Soloviev, the husband of Rasputin's daughter Maria, defrauded prominent Russian families by <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> for a Romanov impostor to escape to China.
