5|$|Like Hitler, Goebbels practiced {{his public}} {{speaking}} skills {{in front of}} a mirror. Meetings were preceded by ceremonial marches and singing, and the venues were decorated with party banners. His entrance (almost always late) was timed for maximum emotional impact. He usually meticulously planned his speeches <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> using pre-planned and choreographed inflection and gestures, but he was also able to improvise and adapt his presentation to make a good connection with his audience.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the portion}} of the highway between the eastern {{terminus}} and the Muskogee Turnpike, known as the Broken Arrow south loop, was scheduled to begin in May 1999 and be completed in January 2001. The section from the Muskogee Turnpike north to the Will Rogers Turnpike was to begin construction in September 1999 and be completed in January 2002. Unlike the section of the turnpike built in the early 1990s, this section was expected to displace few residents; the city of Broken Arrow had purchased much of the right-of-way <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to preserve the corridor for the expected turnpike.|$|E

5|$|Of the 158 {{people on}} board, 73 {{died as a}} result of the crash. The lead flight {{attendant}} was the only crew member to survive. Of the surviving passengers, 72 adults and children over three years old sustained serious injuries, while two sustained minor injuries. Of the 11 infants, two sustained minor injuries, eight were seriously injured, and one, Kenneth Fernando Martinez, the four-month-old son of Gloria L. Martinez, died. The surviving steward testified that there had been no communication from the cockpit as to the unfolding situation and, thus, no warning in the end to assume brace positions. The NTSB report held that, had passengers been warned <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to brace for impact, the severity of some injuries might have been avoided.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began on}} 3 August 1943. Many {{details about the}} performances, lighting, camera angles, action, and effects were worked out <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> in order to not only keep the film under budget but also help achieve {{suspense}} on such a low budget. Dr. Jared Criswell, former pastor of the Fifth Avenue Spiritualist Church of New York City, served as a technical consultant on the film regarding psychic phenomena. The picture's final fight scene between the Finn, Pollo, and the mad Captain was shot on a dimly lit set to heighten the suspense and keep the audience from guessing who the victor might be, {{similar to the way}} Jacques Tourneur and Lewton had shot a similar scene in Cat People.|$|E
5|$|Airfields, harbors and {{shipping}} {{were also the}} targets on October 12, this time in northern Formosa. These {{would be the first}} strikes Fighting 18 executed in the face of both significant anti-aircraft fire and airborne interception by enemy planes. The first fighter sweep of the day launched into overcast skies at 06:17 and headed for Shinchiku Airfield with VF-18 flying low cover. Unfortunately, the Japanese were alerted to the formation's presence <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> and the morning's protective cloud cover dissipated above Shinchiku. Flak of all calibers was intense as a result. Harris and the other Intrepid fighters led the way in, pushing over in glide bombing attacks on hangars around the strip. After the bombs dropped, the fighters headed north for their next target, Matsuyama Airfield. On the way to Matsuyama the cloud cover thickened once more. Just shy of Taien Airfield, VF-18 pilots spotted six Japanese bombers working their way down through a layer of clouds, seemingly on a landing approach. Intrepids fighters caught and destroyed the whole bomber formation in two minutes. Harris was credited with shooting down two of them.|$|E

5|$|Beyond the XIII games, Lightning has {{appeared}} in several spin-offs within the Final Fantasy franchise. In the fighting game Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, Lightning {{is one of the}} warriors summoned by the goddess Cosmos. She was meant to debut in Dissidia Final Fantasy, but the idea was scrapped as Final Fantasy XIII had yet to be released and Square Enix did not want to reveal her abilities <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> During Dissidia 012, Lightning's group is confronted by beings called Manikins, which inflict permanent death on those they defeat, thereby threatening the world's cycle of rebirth. She leads an expedition to the portal from which the Manikins are emerging, and the group sacrifice their lives to close it. Lightning has three alternate outfits in the game. She again appeared as a playable character in the 2015 arcade title, and its home console version Dissidia Final Fantasy NT.|$|E
5|$|Declan McCullagh {{asserts that}} during the trial, the judge sealed the entire court file, forbade the defense from issuing subpoenas to witnesses, granted the {{prosecution}} significant latitude in making negative suggestions about Bell's character, and refused requests for a mistrial. McCullagh also asserts that he was subpoenaed by two Treasury Department agents {{to appear before the}} court, without being notified <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> as required by federal regulations regarding subpoenas involving the media. Following the conviction, Jim Bell renewed his attempts at firing his court-appointed lawyer, appealing his case to the Supreme Court, and filing civil lawsuits against those he alleges were involved in an orchestrated conspiracy to deny him a fair trial and an unbiased, court-appointed defense counsel; his targets included two judges, at least two prosecutors, and his former probation officers and defense attorneys.|$|E
5|$|Robinson Crusoes of Warsaw {{were people}} who, {{after the end}} of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising and the {{subsequent}} planned destruction of Warsaw by Nazi Germany, decided to stay and hide in the ruins of the German-occupied city. The period of hiding spanned as long as three and a half months, from the day of the capitulation of the uprising, October 2, 1944, until the entry of the Red Army on January 17, 1945. Most of the Robinsons were Jews, although a considerable number of non-Jewish Poles were also present. The hideaways lived in the ruins of houses, basements, and bunkers which had been prepared <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> They lived in extremely dire circumstances, while the city was being destroyed around them. Some managed to escape Warsaw, many were captured and killed by the Germans, while others survived until the withdrawal of German troops.|$|E

5|$|Schneider {{plays in}} the {{butterfly}} style of goaltending, dropping to his knees with his skates pointing outwards and his pads meeting in the middle in order to cover the bottom portion of the net. He honed the style with goaltending consultant Brian Daccord, beginning {{at the age of}} 15. After joining the Canucks as a backup in 2010–11, Schneider began working with the team goaltending coach Roland Melanson, who encouraged him to play shallower in his crease. Schneider adopted the style which required him to be more athletic on first shots, but better prepared him for rebounds and cross-crease plays. Schneider's strengths are his size and athleticism. His coach with the Moose, Scott Arniel, has also heralded his ability to get into position <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> anticipating plays.|$|E
5|$|The attackers {{had planned}} the attack several months <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and knew some areas {{well enough to}} vanish and {{reappear}} after security forces had left. Several sources have quoted Kasab telling the police that the group received help from Mumbai residents. The attackers used at least three SIM cards purchased on the Indian {{side of the border}} with Bangladesh. There were also reports of a SIM card purchased in the US state New Jersey, if this is the case, then this would go back to Iraqi Intelligence Services and Al Qaeda from 9–11 or Jemmah Ismaliyah and Egyptian Islamic Jihad through Iraqi Intelligence from Saddam Hussein's old network of militants that was never proved. Police had also mentioned that Faheem Ansari, an Indian Lashkar operative who had been arrested in February 2008, had scouted the Mumbai targets for the November attacks. Later, the police arrested two Indian suspects, Mikhtar Ahmad, who is from Srinagar in Kashmir, and Tausif Rehman, a resident of Kolkata. They supplied the SIM cards, one in Calcutta, and the other in New Delhi.|$|E
5|$|The {{open and}} idealistic ethos did not last. The History Division's {{immediate}} supervisors, Joseph Anderson and G. Homer Durham, failed {{to defend the}} division. Spies within the department, under the instruction of Mark E. Peterson, compiled what they believed to be heretical statements and passed them along to the Twelve Apostles and ultimately the offender's bishop (local ecclesiastical authority). In {{a meeting with the}} first presidency in 1973, LDS Church President Harold B. Lee rejected proposals for a student research award and for a Friends of the Church History organization. Lee preferred that researchers clear sensitive archive research topics like polygamy with the first presidency <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Staff historian D. Michael Quinn published an article in the LDS Church magazine, the Ensign, exploring the origins of the office of presiding bishop, and asserted that Edward Partridge was not the first incumbent. Although Quinn's research was correct, space in the Ensign did not permit a complete documentation of Quinn's research, and some readers felt the article insulted Partridge's memory. Apostle Spencer W. Kimball suggested that Arrington submit an apology to readers; Arrington sent a message to the publisher with his regrets that the article's format was unfortunate.|$|E

5|$|The {{people in}} the coastal areas, {{most of which were}} already {{affected}} by the more catastrophic Pauline a month ago, were ready for Rick. All major ports along the coast were closed <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> in preparation, as well as airports in Huatulco and Puerto Escondido where power failures occurred because of Hurricane Rick. One hundred and thirty Red Cross workers, including twenty that were based in Mexico, who were in the area in the aftermath of Pauline, kept in the area to handle the second hurricane. Many people from Puerto Ángel, Huatulco, and Puerto Escondido (where National Operations Director Bernardino Heredia was overseeing recovery efforts) beach areas were evacuated. During the Puerto Ángel evacuation, helicopters landed carrying soldier and rifles, which one tourist likened to a third-world revolution. In Chiapas, officials watched for flooding along the rivers and upstream river valleys, where the rains from three previous systems caused the ground to saturate and in the state capital of Tuxtla Gutiérrez, families were evacuated due to rising rivers.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} considered Danny Denzongpa for {{the role}} of bandit chief Gabbar Singh, but he could not accept it as he was committed to act in Feroz Khan's Dharmatma (1975), under production at the same time. Amjad Khan, who was the second choice, prepared himself for the part by reading the book Abhishapta Chambal, which told of the exploits of Chambal dacoits. The book was written by Taroon Kumar Bhaduri, the father of fellow cast member Jaya Bhaduri. As cast members had read the script <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> many were interested in playing different parts. Pran was considered {{for the role}} of Thakur Baldev Singh, but Sippy thought Sanjeev Kumar was a better choice. Initially, Dharmendra was also interested {{to play the role of}} Thakur. He eventually gave up the role when Sippy informed him that Sanjeev Kumar would play Veeru if that happened, and would be paired with Hema Malini, who Dharmendra was trying to woo. Dharmendra knew that Kumar was also interested in Malini. Sippy wanted Shatrughan Sinha to play the part of Jai, but there were already several big stars signed, and Amitabh Bachchan, who was not extremely popular yet, lobbied hard to get the part for himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} life was {{improved}} with many Han inventions. The Han Chinese had hempen-bound bamboo scrolls to write on, yet by the 2nd century AD had invented the papermaking process which created a writing medium that was both cheap and easy to produce. The invention of the wheelbarrow aided in the hauling of heavy loads. The maritime junk ship and stern-mounted steering rudder enabled the Chinese to venture out of calmer waters of interior lakes and rivers and into the open sea. The invention of the grid reference for maps and raised-relief map allowed the Chinese to better navigate their terrain. In medicine, they used new herbal remedies to cure illnesses, calisthenics to keep physically fit, and regulated diets to avoid diseases. Authorities in the capital were warned <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> of the direction of sudden earthquakes with {{the invention of the}} seismometer that was tripped by a vibration-sensitive pendulum device. To mark the passing of the seasons and special occasions, the Han Chinese used two variations of the lunisolar calendar, which were established due to efforts in astronomy and mathematics. Han-era Chinese advancements in mathematics include the discovery of square roots, cube roots, the Pythagorean theorem, Gaussian elimination, the Horner scheme, improved calculations of pi, and negative numbers. Hundreds of new roads and canals were built to facilitate transport, commerce, tax collection, communication, and movement of military troops. The Han-era Chinese also employed several types of bridges to cross waterways and deep gorges, such as beam bridges, arch bridges, simple suspension bridges, and pontoon bridges. Han ruins of defensive city walls made of brick or rammed earth still stand today.|$|E
