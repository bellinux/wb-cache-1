5|$|HD 209458 b, {{also given}} the {{nickname}} Osiris, is an exoplanet that orbits the solar analog HD 209458 {{in the constellation}} Pegasus, some 150 light-years from the Solar System. The radius of the planet's orbit is 7 million kilometres, about 0.047 astronomical units, or one eighth the radius of Mercury's orbit. This small radius results in <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>that</b> is 3.5 Earth days long and an estimated surface temperature of about 1,000°C (about 1,800°F).

5|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that there were two}} billion cases of gastroenteritis that resulted in 1.3million deaths globally in 2015. Children and those in the developing world are most commonly affected. As of 2011, in those less than five, there were about 1.7billion cases resulting in 0.7million deaths, with most of these occurring in the world's poorest nations. More than 450,000 of these fatalities are due to rotavirus in children under 5years of age. Cholera causes about three to five million cases of disease and kills approximately 100,000 people yearly. In the developing world, children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>that</b> result in significant gastroenteritis. It is less common in adults, partly due to the development of acquired immunity.|$|E

5|$|Since 1904, {{after the}} District had {{notified}} the Met {{that it would}} not use its running rights on the Uxbridge line with steam trains, it had not run services, although it paid the £2,000 <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>that</b> was due under the enabling Act. When the District suggested running as far as Rayners Lane, the Met responded with a proposal to rebuild the station as a District terminus. The District proposed running trains through to Uxbridge, leading to negotiations about the charges for traction current before District services were extended to Uxbridge on 1 March 1910. In 1910 a platform was built at Mill Hill Park for the Hounslow and Uxbridge shuttles and a flying junction built north of the station to separate the Ealing and Hounslow traffic. The station was renamed Acton Town on 1 March 1910.|$|E

5|$|The French naval {{authorities}} considered Allemand's cruise a major {{success in}} <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>that</b> had cost them {{huge numbers of}} ships and men. In addition to Ranger and Calcutta, Allemand had captured the hired naval cutter Dove and 43 merchant ships, including the lumbering Brothers. With the exception of Calcutta, all of these prizes had been burnt and their prisoners had been transferred to the French squadron, 1,200 in total. For minimal casualties, Allemand had inflicted a blow against British Atlantic trade and tied up substantial Royal Navy resources during a complicated and strategically vital campaign. Calcutta was bought into the French Navy and became an armed storeship, still carrying the designated 50 guns. She served for three years before her destruction at the Battle of the Basque Roads in April 1809. Her British officers were later exchanged and honourably acquitted at the court-martial that investigated her loss.|$|E
