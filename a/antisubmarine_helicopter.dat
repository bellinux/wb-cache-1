25|$|This major {{overhaul}} {{was intended to}} extend a warships' service life and improve sensor and weapon systems. Begun on 28 May, Carpenter received drone <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>helicopter</b> (DASH) support equipment, anti-submarine rocket (ASROC) weapons, and, since the 3-inch/70s had proved a maintenance disaster, a dual 5-inch/38 mount forward. Communication, radar, and sonar upgrades were installed along with general equipment improvements and a helicopter refueling system.|$|E
50|$|The Talwar {{class can}} {{accommodate}} one Ka-28 Helix-A <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>helicopter</b> or one Ka-31 Helix-B {{airborne early warning}} helicopter which can provide over-the-horizon targeting. The vessel can also embark the navalised variant of the indigenous HAL Dhruv.|$|E
50|$|In December 1959, after 15 {{years of}} {{destroyer}} service, {{she entered the}} Norfolk Naval Shipyard where she underwent modernization (FRAM). Four years later, in April 1963, she put into Boston for further modernization, receiving this time a Drone <b>Antisubmarine</b> <b>Helicopter</b> deck. Following these yard periods she resumed her hunter-killer exercises in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.|$|E
5000|$|America {{launched}} {{one of her}} <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>helicopters,</b> a Sikorsky SH-3A Sea King of <b>Helicopter</b> <b>Antisubmarine</b> Squadron (HS) 9, {{and gained}} sonar contact. At midnight, the contact was reclassified as a [...] "probable" [...] submarine. At that time, no known or friendly submarines were reported {{to be in the}} area of the contact. The destroyers maintained good sonar contact through the night.|$|R
5000|$|In January 1967, the Noa {{received}} two QH-50 DASH drone <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>helicopters.</b> She then served as school ship for the Fleet Sonar School at Key West (28 January - 11 February). [...] "Operation Springboard" [...] {{took her to}} the Caribbean 3-11 March and she steamed in Mediterranean waters June through November.|$|R
50|$|William R. Rush {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of 1966 on operations off the eastern seaboard, ranging from Newport to the Virginia Capes, pursuing a well-rounded slate of exercises including, among others, such areas as gunfire support and ASW. Early in 1967, the ship enhanced her capabilities as an ASW destroyer by receiving two Drone <b>Antisubmarine</b> <b>Helicopters</b> (DASH) and becoming fully qualified in DASH operations.|$|R
5000|$|Drydocked during August and September for {{hull and}} sonar dome repair, Wiltsie put to sea soon {{afterwards}} for tests and trials of her DASH (drone <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>helicopter)</b> qualification system which ended successfully on 3 November. The destroyer subsequently participated in Operation [...] "Union Square", an extensive fleet exercise, {{before returning to}} San Diego {{to prepare for the}} ship's 14th WestPac deployment.|$|E
50|$|This major {{overhaul}} {{was intended to}} extend a warships' service life and improve sensor and weapon systems. Begun on 28 May, Carpenter received drone <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>helicopter</b> (DASH) support equipment, anti-submarine rocket (ASROC) weapons, and, since the 3-inch/70s had proved a maintenance disaster, a dual 5-inch/38 mount forward. Communication, radar, and sonar upgrades were installed along with general equipment improvements and a helicopter refueling system.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} provide the ships with a {{credible}} anti-submarine weapon, the FRAM I upgrade for the Gearings centered on the addition of AN/SQS-23 sonar and two new weapon systems, the ASROC rocket-assisted torpedo launcher {{with a range of}} 1-5 miles (not in FRAM II upgrades), and the DASH <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>helicopter</b> with a range of up to 22 mi. [...] Both were armed with the new Mark 44 torpedo, which was also carried in torpedo tubes on the ships. ASROC could also launch a nuclear depth charge.|$|E
50|$|Active sonobuoys, {{containing}} a sonar transmitter and receiver, can be dropped from fixed-wing {{maritime patrol aircraft}} (e.g., P-3, Nimrod, Chinese Y-8, Russian and Indian Bear ASW variants), <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>helicopters,</b> and carrier-based <b>antisubmarine</b> aircraft (e.g., S-3). While {{there have been some}} efforts to use other aircraft simply as carriers of sonobuoys, the general assumption is that the sonobuoy-carrying aircraft can issue commands to the sonobuoys and receive, and to some extent process, their signals.|$|R
50|$|In June 1962, Ault {{entered the}} Boston Naval Shipyard for a Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul. Designed {{to extend the}} life of the {{destroyer}} by eight years, the overhaul enabled her to meet the challenge of newer and faster enemy submarines. Aults 40 mm and 20 mm gunmounts were removed, and her 01 level afterdeck was converted to a helicopter flight deck to facilitate the use of drone <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>helicopters</b> (DASH), one of the Navy's newest weapon systems which enabled the destroyer to reach out farther in search of submarine targets.|$|R

5000|$|Returning to San Diego on 18 September, the warship resumed {{a regular}} {{schedule}} of local operations. Drills with submarines, {{such as a}} mid-January 1962 sonar training exercise with [...] and , kept her busy until 6 March when she entered drydock at the Naval Repair Facility, San Diego. During the ensuing upgrade, part of the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) program, the warship lost her after 3-inch/50 twin mount to the initial flight deck modifications for the drone <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>helicopter</b> (DASH), but received a modern SQS-23 sonar and two triple-mount lightweight ASW torpedo tubes.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly after {{finishing}} her underway training, the ship {{took part in}} Operation [...] "Silverlance." [...] In March 1965, she received a drone <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>helicopter</b> (DASH) system and held trials of her new equipment off San Clemente Island. A midshipman training cruise occupied {{a large part of}} her summer. The destroyer sailed on 19 October for the Western Pacific. Following stops at Pearl Harbor and Subic Bay, Arnold J. Isbell relievedBrinkley Bass (DD-887)on 30 December on the northern search and rescue (SAR) station in the Gulf of Tonkin and began her first duty in the combat zone off the coast of Vietnam. The warship then became a unit of TF 77.|$|E
5000|$|The AS.12 saw {{action on}} both sides of the 1982 Falklands War. It was fired from Westland Wasp {{helicopters}} against the Argentine submarine [...] A total of nine missiles were fired at the submarine which was trapped on the surface and unable to dive after its dive tanks suffered damage from a depth charge attack by a British Royal Navy Wessex HAS.3 <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>helicopter.</b> Of the missiles fired four hit, four missed and one failed to launch. Two of the missiles that hit the target failed to detonate on impact, instead punching a hole through the slender conning tower and exploding on the far side.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Antisubmarine</b> <b>{{helicopter}}s</b> {{can carry}} a [...] "dipping" [...] sonar head {{at the end of}} a cable, which the helicopter can raise from or lower into the water. The helicopter would typically dip the sonar when trying to localize a target submarine, usually in cooperation with other ASW platforms or with sonobuoys. Typically, the helicopter would raise the head after dropping an ASW weapon, to avoid damaging the sensitive receiver. Not all variants of the same basic helicopter, even assigned to ASW, carry dipping sonar; some may trade the weight of the sonar for more sonobuoy or weapon capacity.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the latter}} part of the month, the ship entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for a six-week {{availability}} during which she received control equipment associated with the Drone <b>Antisubmarine</b> <b>Helicopter</b> (DASH) system. The installation was completed early in March, and Van Voorhis departed Boston on the 9th to participate in the annual [...] "Springboard" [...] exercises conducted in the Caribbean. Upon completion of that assignment, Van Voorhis returned north to receive her DASH helicopters. She arrived in Norfolk on 29 March and began three weeks of tests and qualifications with the DASH system. The first destroyer escort to receive DASH, Van Voorhis completed her qualification trials in April and returned to her home port on 21 April.|$|E
50|$|On 16 October, Wallace L. Lind began a pre-FRAM availability; and, {{one month}} later, she {{underwent}} Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) II conversion. This overhaul {{amounted to a}} complete renewal of her after superstructure, a new and modern combat information center, and modernization or complete overhaul of almost all machinery, weapons systems, and living accommodations. Changes to weapons systems involved adding to the previously-installed Hedgehog mounts two new side torpedo racks amidships for current inventory torpedoes. Immediately aft of the torpedo deck on the 01 level of the new superstructure, a hangar area and flight deck, from which the new Drone <b>Antisubmarine</b> <b>Helicopter</b> (DASH) could operate, was installed. Also installed was a variable depth sonar rig adding coverage for submarine search at various depth levels.|$|E
50|$|Her {{superstructure}} silhouette changed markedly as {{she received}} a larger combat information center (CIC) and sonar control {{as well as an}} antisubmarine rocket (ASROC) launcher, a torpedo magazine, and a hangar and flight deck for the Gyrodyne QH-50 DASH, a drone <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>helicopter.</b> The new ASROC launcher was installed between the stacks in the space formerly held by her 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes which, in turn, were replaced by two 12.75-inch triple torpedo tube mounts located on the 01 level forward of the bridge — one to port and the other to starboard. These MK 32 mounts replaced the second 5-inch 38-caliber gun mount forward. The DASH flight deck and hangar, along with the ASROC/torpedo magazine was installed just aft of the after stack. Her surface battery was thus reduced to two twin 5-inch, 38-caliber in twin mounts.|$|E
50|$|On 1 November 1958, Chicago was {{reclassified}} CG-11 and towed to San Francisco Naval Shipyard {{to begin}} a five-year conversion (20 months longer than Columbus and 13 months longer than Albany) to a guided missile cruiser. Begun on 1 July 1959, the entire superstructure was removed and replaced with new aluminum compartments, modernized electronic systems, and an improved Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) equipped combat information center. Representative of the new technological focus on guided missiles, Chicago was refitted with Tartar and Talos SAM stowage, loading, launching, and guidance systems. Two triple torpedo tubes, an ASROC launcher, two 5 in/38 cal guns, and two <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>helicopters</b> rounded out the cruisers’ modifications.|$|R
5000|$|On 1 April 1958, Rear Admiral John S. Thach hoisted his two-star flag to the carrier's main as {{the ship}} became {{flagship}} of Task Group Alpha (TG Alpha). This group, built around Valley Forge, included eight destroyers, two submarines, and one squadron each of <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>helicopters</b> and airplanes; a detachment of airborne early warning airplanes, modified A-1 Skyraiders called [...] "guppies" [...] because of their bulging ventral Radomes; and a land-based Lockheed P-2 Neptune. A significant development in naval tactics, TG Alpha concentrated solely on developing and perfecting new devices and techniques for countering the potential menace of enemy submarines {{in an age of}} nuclear propulsion and deep-diving submersibles.|$|R
50|$|She then {{typically}} {{carried an}} air {{group of eight}} AV-8S fighters, four Sea King <b>antisubmarine</b> warfare <b>helicopters</b> and four AB 212ASW Twin Hueys although Sikorsky S-55/CH-19s, AH-1 Cobras, and other specialized helicopters from the Spanish army, air force, and navy flew from her flight deck.|$|R
50|$|Brownson {{received}} the FRAM I modifications in 1959-60. This included removal of gun mount 53, where a DASH (Drone, <b>Antisubmarine</b> <b>Helicopter)</b> deck/hangar was placed. It received ASROC, among other things. It returned from service in Viet Nam via the Suez Canal in 1967. It was later modified in the Boston NSY in 1967 with a large, low frequency, rubberized, prototype sonar dome just forward of midships {{and a smaller}} sonar receiver, aft but also along the keel, to achieve '3D' sonar 'pictures'. It spent several months operating out of Newport with the DESDEV (Destroyer Development Group) evaluating the sonar system. This required that it get underway during heavy storms to evaluate the new dome under conditions of high sea states. It underwent REFTRA (Refresher Training) in Gitmo in winter 1971-72, joined the Sixth Fleet north of Egypt that spring, and participated in NATO fleet exercises.|$|E
5000|$|The {{period from}} June 1960 to April 1966 brought {{significant}} changes to Stribling. From June 1960 until April 1966, she was modified extensively at the Charleston Navy Yard under the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) program. After refresher training out of Guantanamo Bay {{and participation in}} NATO exercise [...] "Lime Jug," [...] Stribling stood watch during the recovery of astronaut, John Glenn, in February 1962. In August, she deployed to the 6th Fleet, but spent {{at least a third}} of that tour {{in the vicinity of the}} Persian Gulf, operating with the Middle East Force. She exercised with units of the Saudi Arabian and Iranian navies and visited many new ports, notably Djibouti in French Somaliland, Kharg Island in Iran, and Aden. Striblings next two deployments were also with the Middle East Force. In the spring of 1966, the destroyer received a Drone <b>Antisubmarine</b> <b>Helicopter</b> (DASH) system and, by 4 May 1966, completed DASH qualification. In February and March 1966, she participated in Polaris missile firing tests on the Atlantic test range.|$|E
50|$|On 18 May 1964, she {{departed}} Newport {{to fulfill}} a familiar role as sonar school training ship at Key West {{en route to the}} West Indies where the warship underwent refresher training during June and the first half of July. Upon arrival back at Newport on 24 July, Basilone enjoyed three weeks of leave and tender availability. For a week in August and over two weeks in September, she participated in ASW operations that included two fleet exercises. After three more weeks of upkeep and another assignment to the sonar school at Key West, the destroyer sailed to Guantanamo Bay to act as a gunfire support duty ship during the last week of October. On 27 November, following three weeks of preparation at Newport, Basilone commenced a four-month tour of duty with the 6th Fleet, serving primarily in the screen of a carrier task force in the western Mediterranean and visiting ports in Spain, Italy, and Majorca. Following her return to Norfolk in March 1965, upkeep, maintenance, and the installation of a drone <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>helicopter</b> (DASH) system occupied her attention until early June. From late June until early September, midshipman summer training cruises took up most of the destroyer's time. During this period, Basilone also took part in numerous antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises, many of which were carried out in cooperation with British, Canadian, and German naval units. Although tender availability at Newport occupied the destroyer for {{most of the rest of}} 1965, she did get underway to aid the aborted Gemini VI mission in October and spent two weeks engaged in ASW and amphibious exercises involving substantial Atlantic Fleet forces early in December.|$|E
5000|$|After being {{based at}} Barcelona, Altair {{returned}} to the United States {{from time to time}} for overhaul and modification. In 1959 she received a helicopter landing platform to enable her to carry out early vertical replenishment operations to supply ships at sea, which she and the fleet oiler [...] pioneered with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterraean Sea in 1962 using Sikorsky HSS-2 Sea King (later redesignated SH-3A Sea King) <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>helicopters.</b> She also received a complete material handling system which included new elevators, forklifts, trucks, conveyor belts, and the first electronic accounting system to be placed on board a ship, which greatly facilitated her task of keeping track of the more than 25,000 items on her general stores inventory.|$|R

5000|$|The damaged {{destroyer}} {{returned to}} Saipan and Pearl Harbor for temporary repairs and on 10 September entered dry dock at Hunter's Point, California, for permanent repairs. Repairs completed on 20 November, she departed San Diego 4 February 1946 {{to join the}} Atlantic Fleet. Borie remained in the Atlantic Fleet, except for one cruise to Korea (6 September 1950 - 9 June 1951), during which she served with TF 77 and {{took part in the}} Hungnam Evacuation. Borie made at least five European and Mediterranean cruises. During a cruise (28 July-4 December 1956), she assisted in the evacuation of American nationals and United Nations truce teams from Haifa, Israel, and Gaza, Egypt. She returned to more routine operations, with a few notable exceptions: her 1959 recovery of the Project Mercury nose cone and Sam, the space monkey; her 1960 surveillance duties with the Polaris missile submarines [...] and and in 1961, a Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul. In the Caribbean in 1962, she rescued nine Cubans seeking asylum in the U.S. and, later, three Jamaican fishermen, and then joined the U.S. blockade during the Cuban Missile Crisis where Borie participated in forcing a diesel-powered Russian submarine to the surface. She then offered the sub aid and supplies (an insult to the sub.) Borie, then along with two other destroyers, escorted it out of the area. During the night Borie received orders to head for the Panama Canal and wait for 20 amphibious ships from the west coast to establish an attack task force. Over the ensuing years, she acquired a Drone <b>Antisubmarine</b> <b>Helicopter</b> (DASH) system and during a Mediterranean deployment, rescued an F-8 Crusader pilot whose plane crashed in a landing attempt on the aircraft carrier [...]|$|E
50|$|During the 2000-2001 {{deployment}} of Carrier Group Two, San Jacinto had aboard <b>Helicopter</b> <b>Antisubmarine</b> Squadron Light 42 (HSL-42) Det 8 with two SH-60B Seahawks.|$|R
50|$|The HH-60H's {{standard}} crew is pilot, copilot, an enlisted crew chief, and two door gunners. The HH-60H {{is operated}} by <b>Helicopter</b> <b>Antisubmarine</b> (HS) squadrons {{with a standard}} dispersal of four F-models and three H-models. In Iraq, HH-60Hs were used by the Navy, assisting the Army, for MEDEVAC purposes and special operations missions. As the Navy transitions its <b>Helicopter</b> <b>Antisubmarine</b> (HS) squadrons to the MH-60R, remaining HH-60Hs are being transferred to its East and West coast special operations squadrons (HSC-84 and HSC-85, respectively).|$|R
50|$|Modern navies began a {{trend in}} the late 20th and early 21st centuries towards smaller, more {{manoeuvrable}} surface capability. Corvettes have a displacement between 540 and 3000 LT and measure 180 - 420 ft in length. They are usually armed with medium- and small-caliber guns, surface-to-surface missiles, surface-to-air missiles, and antisubmarine weapons. Many can accommodate a small or medium <b>antisubmarine</b> warfare <b>helicopter.</b>|$|R
50|$|Defence {{spending}} increased slightly {{during the}} late 1970s, and in the 1980s only the defence and Official Development Assistance budgets were allowed to increase in real terms. In 1985 the Defence Agency developed the Mid-Term Defence Estimate objectives for FY 1986 through FY 1990, to improve SDF front-line equipment and upgrade logistic support systems. For the GSDF, these measures included the purchase of advanced weapons and equipment to improve antitank, artillery, ground-to-sea firepower, and mobile capabilities. For the MSDF, {{the focus was on}} upgrading antisubmarine capabilities, with the purchase of new destroyer escorts equipped with the Aegis system and SH-60J <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>helicopters,</b> and on improving antimine warfare and air defence systems. ASDF funds were concentrated on the purchase of fighter aircraft and rescue helicopters. The entire cost of the Mid-Term Defence Estimate for FY 1986 through FY 1990 was projected at approximately ¥18.4 trillion (approximately US$83.2 billion, at the 1985 exchange rate).|$|R
5000|$|HSC-8 traces its lineage to {{the second}} of two squadrons which bore the {{designation}} <b>Helicopter</b> <b>Antisubmarine</b> Squadron EIGHT (HS-8). That Squadron which has become HSC-8 was established on November 1, 1969.|$|R
