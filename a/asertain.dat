5000|$|Long was {{the first}} obstetric anesthetist. In 1845, he had his wife inhale ether while she was giving birth. Until recently, his {{practice}} of using inhalation anesthesia dominated obstetrics. In 1849, Long announced his discovery in a small local magazine. However, he did not receive significant recognition until Dr. Marion Sims, a famous New York surgeon, published the first major article about Long's contribution. Today, the majority of scholars concur that Long performed the first successful surgery using anesthesia. In fact, Long administered ether to 7 patients, none of whom felt any pain during their operations, several years prior to Morton's 1846 public exposition. One of Long's letters is very revealing as to the origins of Morton's ideas. He wrote, [...] "Permit me to say then, that a Dentist and a surgeon from Boston, Mass. were in Jefferson Jackson County in I842, 3 or 4 and remained for several weeks. The dentist practiced his profession & the surgeon operated for strabismus-I have always thought it probable, that the Dentist was Morton or Wells, & that a knowledge of my use of ether in surgical operations was obtained at that time. I {{have not been able}} to ascertain the name of the dentist, if you know the history of Dr. Wells, you can possibly <b>asertain</b> (sic) whether he travelled South at the time mentioned." [...] Reportedly, Long didn't publish his findings until 1849 for two reasons. One, he wished to confirm the results of his experiments several times before propagating his ideas. Second, he wished to wait to see if another medical practitioner came forward to counter Morton's claims to discovery, a physician who potentially discovered anesthesia prior to himself. After reading about Morton's demonstration in the Medical Examiner, Long began asking his patients to submit affidavits corroborating his discovery. While Long almost certainly discovered the anesthetic powers of ether before Morton demonstrated its ability to dull pain during surgery to the general public, several other men sought credit for their supposed joint contribution to surgery. These men included Morton, Horace Wells of Hartford, Connecticut, and Charles J. Jackson. Throughout what became known as the [...] "ether controversy", the men vied for a reward of $200,000 from the US Congress. Initially, it appears as though many were reluctant to give Long any credit. William Welch reportedly said, [...] "We cannot assign to him any influence upon the historical development of our knowledge of surgical anesthesia or any share in its introduction to the world at large." [...] In 1879, a year after Long's death, the National Eclectic Medical Association declared that he was the official discoverer of anesthesia. At Long's funeral, Chancellor Andrew Lipscomb said: [...] "Standing here in the presence of his remains, I am this day but the voice of the church, of his professional brethren, and of this whole community when I say in Dr. Long's death we have lost an excellent man. He assumed nothing, and was thoroughly truthful in looks, tone, manner and action; lived simply, treated everyone courteously, and walked humbly before God. Modest even to the verge of timidity, he could be stern and bold, and utterly forgetful of self, if responsibility had to be met, or danger confronted. Gentle, forbearing, faithful to every wise instinct, he kept the covenant of a heart's true love until his days were numbered. He had strength of will and power of endurance. The minor heroisms which make up so large a share of a physician's experience, and of which the world knows so little, wrote many a paragraph in the annals of his life. We shall give the manly virtues of Christian integrity of Crawford Long a dwelling place where so many of the elect of our life already gathered."In 1879, the National Eclectic Medical Association declared that Long was the official discoverer of anesthesia. [...] "Doctors Day" [...] is celebrated on March 30 every year to commemorate Long's contributions.|$|E

Captain Cook, in the {{description}} of his third voyage, already states that the Aborigines smeared their hair and beard with, a mixture of grease and red ochre. Later observers who came in contact with the Aborigines noticed the same. Questions remain unresolved as to the reasons why only the male aboriginies did this. Many theories have been put forward, such as the Aborigines believed that hair clotted with ochre was seen as an exclusive male ornament, or it was done as a symbolic act, representing the blood of the vanquished enemy. It has been <b>asertained</b> that the red ochre as used by the Aborigines is not a natural, but an artificial produce, being the result of roasting certain suitable iron ores in the fire...|$|R

40|$|Author abstract]The {{purpose of}} the stady was to <b>asertain</b> whether ionic {{strength}} other than phosphate and ammonium ion represents the different condition on the phosphate and ammonium adsorption coefficient (P_ 2 O_ 5 or NH_ 4 -N mg/lOOg soil) or not with some typical soils. At the same time, causal connection between both adsorptive coefficient and phosphate or ammonium ion solubilities in bulk solution was discussed. The results are summarized as follows: 1) The effect of coexistence of other ions except for phosphate and ammonium in soil solution on phosphate adsorptive coefficient generally indicated the high value coefficient. Conversely, for the nitrogen coefficient, the value were reduced. 2) Both component adsorptive coefficient to the same soil were different from a little with consist of ionic species except for phosphate and ammonium ion. In this experiment condition, the ionic strength in the bulk solution did not always followed that same relation were formed to the coefficient. 3) Increase of the coexistence of salt in soil solution resulted the high activity of hydronium and ammonium ion, conversely, low activity of phosphate ions. 4) It seemed that phosphate adsorption by soil particle in this condition affect each phosphoric acid potential in the bulk solution, ammonium adsorption also dominated each ammonium potential in the bulk solution.

40|$|Over {{the past}} {{number of years}} there has been a move towards using ICT. This study explores factors that affect post-primary {{teachers}} use of ICT in the teaching and learning environment. The researcher used a case study approach to investigate ICT use in a recently established community school in Ireland. A self-administered questionnaire was issued to all teaching staff (n= 70). A random sample of teachers (n= 7) were interviewed on their ICT practices and attitudes towards using ICT. School management were also interviewed to <b>asertain</b> their views on ICT use within the case study school. The results recorded show that there is a high level of ICT use in the case study school. Factors identified as affecting teachers use of ICT in the teaching and learning environment were identified. The following factors were found to affect ICT use in the case study school - positive attitudes towards using ICT, level of ICT training and support, lack of time, lack of a detailed ICT policy, both teachers and managements’ attitude towards using ICT, easy access and availalbility of ICT hardware and software and the teaching group. The study did not identify teacher pedagogy, age and gender as significant factors affecting teachers’ ICT use in the case study school. The paper concludes by noting that while there may be significant benefits and potential in the use of ICT in the teaching and learning environment {{it is important to understand}} the factors that affect teachers’ willingness to embrace and use this technology. If educators are aware of the factors affecting ICT use it allows both teachers and management to continue to progress and develop their ICT use in the teaching and learning environment...|$|E
40|$|Watson type gyro-sensor is {{composed}} of orthogonal-arm type tuning fork, and its two flexural vibration modes, related to the Corioli 2 ̆ 7 s force, are utilized. It is considered that the mechanical coupling between such two resonance modes in this type tuning fork is smaller {{than that of a}} normal tuning fork because one half pair of arms vibrates for driving and the other vibrates for sensing, independently. This paper describes on the coupling charcteristics of the orthogonal-arm type tuning fork designed for the guiding principle to set the frequency intervals of two frequencies of driving and sensing close. It is <b>asertained</b> by the finite element analysis of some tuning forks that the mechanical coupling of the orthogonal-arm type tuning fork is small in comparison with a normal tuning fofk. Depending upon the analyses, rectification of directions of diagonal vibrational displacements is investigated, and a new rectification method is devised which is achieved by balancing the center of mass-gravity at the joint part of orthogonal arms. Moreover, in this paper transition values of various circuit factors of the gyro-sensor are found clear for such balance adjusting...|$|R

The extensive files contain, among other sets of information, detailed pathology data on more than 400 long-term (most often 24 -month) chemical carcinogenesis studies, comprising nearly 1600 individual experiments having at least 10 million tissue sections that have been evaluated for toxicity and carcinogenicity. Using this data set we have a) deternmned the concordance in carcinogenic responses between rats and mice to be 74 % and between sexes to be 85 % (rats) to 87 % (mice); b) discovered that using male rats and female mice would have identified correctly 95 % of the positive or no evidence chemical carcinogenicity results obtained using the more extensive protocol; c) established a historical control file of tumor incidence data; d) evaluated the false positive rate {{in the interpretation of}} carcinogenesis studies, concluding that this rate is probably no more than 7 to 8 %; e) compiled listngs of chemicals having like carcinogenic target sites for each ofthe 37 organs or systems for which histopathoo diag s have been recorded routinely; J) demonstrated that evaluation of site-specific carcinogenic effects are preferable to doing analyses based on overall (all sites combined) tumor rates; g) learned that few chemicals cause only benign tumors or only liver tumors, the most common target site for chemically induced cancers; h) identified key sources of variability in tunor rates in long-termcarcinogenesis studies; i) <b>asertained</b> that corn oil gavage or gavageper se exhibits little, if any, adverse impact on long-term studies;J) showed that the Salmonella multistrain assa...|$|R
