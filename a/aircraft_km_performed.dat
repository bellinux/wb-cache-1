40|$|Generally, {{the task}} of a roadmap {{is to make sure}} that from the given {{starting}} point we can achieve the final destination within the specified constraints. This paper describes the roadmap developed and followed to implement Knowledge Management (KM) in ESOC. Once having recognized the need of <b>KM</b> and <b>performed</b> some benchmark activities, the first important step of the roadmap is to lay down the foundation for KM at ESOC. This foundation consists of setting up the organization of <b>KM,</b> <b>performing</b> an analysis of the knowledge existing in the different technical domains and conducting the knowledge coverage and criticality analysis. Based on the obtained results, an appraisal is performed with the conclusion that specific actions such as the development of knowledge capture, sharing and preservation methodologies in ESOC, should be followed up. Next phase of the roadmap is dedicated to expand existing KM tools as well as designing and launching new prototypes. The paper presents also the model developed for the expansion of the KM system. The model is based on the application of the Minimum Factor Law, known earlier in the agricultural field, to the field of KM. Finally, the last step of the roadmap is the institutionalization of the KM system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Although {{since the}} days of the Shakey robot, there have been a rich variety of mobile robots, we realize that there were still no general autonomous, {{unsupervised}} mobile robots servicing users in our buildings. In this paper, we contribute the algorithms and results of our successful deployment of a service mobile robot agent, CoBot, in our multi-floor office environment. CoBot accepts requests from users, autonomously navigates between floors of the building, and asks for help when needed in a symbiotic relationship with the humans in its environment. We present the details of such challenging deployment, in particular the effective real-time depth-camera based localization and navigation algorithms, the symbiotic human-robot interaction approach, and the multitask dynamic planning and scheduling algorithm. We conclude with a comprehensive analysis of the extensive results of the last two weeks of daily CoBot runs for a total of more than 8. 7 <b>km,</b> <b>performing</b> a large varied set of user requests.

40|$|Based on {{the ethnographic}} data {{collected}} from the workplace of an academic library, I argue that workplace learning (WL) is a situated socio-cognitive process. It is expedited by knowledge management (KM), which is a collective effort to generate, share, and institutionalize work-related knowledge. KM {{is inherent in the}} face-to-face conversational interactions embedded in planned formal training, planned informal sharing, and spontaneous informal learning. When face-to-face interaction is not possible, KM is accomplished through textualization. It helps the members of the workplace acquire new work-related knowledge and integrate it to their common, contextualized knowledge base. The contents of the knowledge base are manifested in the members’ professional practices and explicated by their professional/communal discourse. By virtue of their distinctive practices and discourse, the members form a community of practice (CoP) and gain their professional/communal identity. Whenever they engage in <b>KM,</b> <b>perform</b> their practices, and/or use their discourse, they authenticate their professional/communal identity and enact their CoP...|$|R
