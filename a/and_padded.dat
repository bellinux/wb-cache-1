5|$|Domestic geese {{are much}} larger than their wild {{counterparts}} and tend to have thick necks, an upright posture, and large bodies with broad rear ends. The greylag-derived birds are large and fleshy and used for meat, while the Chinese geese have smaller frames and are mainly used for egg production. The fine down of both is valued for use in pillows <b>and</b> <b>padded</b> garments. They forage on grass and weeds, supplementing this with small invertebrates, {{and one of the}} attractions of rearing geese is their ability to grow and thrive on a grass-based system. They are very gregarious and have good memories and can be allowed to roam widely in the knowledge that they will return home by dusk. The Chinese goose is more aggressive and noisy than other geese and {{can be used as a}} guard animal to warn of intruders. The flesh of meat geese is dark-coloured and high in protein, but they deposit fat subcutaneously, although this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids. The birds are killed either around 10 or about 24 weeks. Between these ages, problems with dressing the carcase occur because of the presence of developing pin feathers.|$|E

The clinical characters in different ABI levels were analyzed, and the diagnostic value of high ABI to CVD <b>and</b> <b>PAD</b> was determined. Compared with the normal ABI group, the high ABI (> 1. 3) group had a higher prevalence of CVD <b>and</b> <b>PAD</b> but less than the low ABI (0. 9) group.

One of his main assets against the Inca armies was the Spanish cavalry because horses provided a considerable advantage in hitting power, maneuverability, speed, and stamina over Inca warriors. All Spaniards wore some kind of armor, {{the most commonly used}} types were chain mail shirts <b>and</b> <b>padded</b> cloth armor which were lighter and cheaper than full armor suits; they were complemented by steel helmets and small iron or wooden shields. The main Spanish offensive weapon was the steel sword, which horsemen supplemented with the lance; both weapons could easily penetrate the padded armor worn by Inca troops. Firearms, such as arquebuses were rarely used during the Spanish conquest of Peru because they were scarce, hard to use, and despised by horsemen as an ungentlemanly weapon. Spaniards relied heavily on Indian auxiliaries because they provided thousands of warriors as well as support personnel and supplies. These native troops had the same sorts of arms and armor as their Inca counterparts. During the Ollantaytambo campaign, the Pizarro expedition included thousands of auxiliaries, mainly Cañaris, Chachapoyas, and Wankas as well as several members of the Inca nobility opposed to Manco Inca.|$|E

40|$|The Arabidopsis EDS 1 <b>and</b> <b>PAD</b> 4 genes encode lipase-like {{proteins}} that function in resistance (R)  gene-mediated and basal plant disease resistance. Phenotypic analysis of eds 1 <b>and</b> <b>pad</b> 4 null mutants shows that EDS 1 <b>and</b> <b>PAD</b> 4 {{are required for}} resistance conditioned by the same spectrum of R genes but fulfil distinct roles within the defence pathway. EDS 1 is essential for elaboration of the plant hypersensitive response, whereas EDS 1 <b>and</b> <b>PAD</b> 4 are both required for accumulation of the plant defence-potentiating molecule, salicylic acid. EDS 1 is necessary for pathogen-induced PAD 4 mRNA accumulation, whereas mutations in PAD 4 or depletion of salicylic acid only partially compromise EDS 1 expression. Yeast two-hybrid analysis reveals that EDS 1 can dimerize <b>and</b> interact with <b>PAD</b> 4. However, EDS 1 dimerization is mediated by different domains to those involved in EDS 1 –PAD 4 association. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that EDS 1 <b>and</b> <b>PAD</b> 4 proteins interact in healthy and pathogen-challenged plant cells. We propose two functions for EDS 1. The first is required early in plant defence, independently of PAD 4. The second recruits PAD 4 in the amplification of defences, possibly by direct EDS 1 –PAD 4 association...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{have evolved}} a {{multilayered}} {{immune system to}} counter pathogen attacks. EDS 1 (Enhanced Disease Susceptibility 1) <b>and</b> <b>PAD</b> 4 (Phytoalexin Deficient 4) are two plant- specific lipase-like proteins that function as essential regulators of plant innate immunity. They are crucial for basal defence that restricts growth of virulent pathogens and for race-specific resistance to avirulent pathogens triggered by TIR (Toll-Interleukin 1) type NBS-LRR (Nucleotide Binding Site � Leucine Rich Repeats) immune receptors. Moreover, EDS 1 <b>and</b> <b>PAD</b> 4 generate <b>and</b> perceive (a) signal(s) needed to induce systemic immunity. These regulators stimulate accumulation of the phenolic defence signaling molecule salicylic acid (SA) and SA, in turn, induces their expression creating a positive feedback loop in defence potentiation. EDS 1 <b>and</b> <b>PAD</b> 4 transcript <b>and</b> correspondent protein levels increase upon pathogen challenge. However, earlier changes in expression {{of a set of}} distinct genes which are EDS 1 - <b>and</b> <b>PAD</b> 4 -dependent imply the activation of pre-existing EDS 1 /PAD 4 complexes through post-translational mechanism(s). In this work I investigated the relative importance of transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptional processes for EDS 1 <b>and</b> <b>PAD</b> 4 protein functions. I characterized Arabidopsis thaliana transgenic lines overexpressing either EDS 1, PAD 4 or both. Only lines cooverexpressing EDS 1 <b>and</b> <b>PAD</b> exhibited growth retardation associated with constitutive activation of the SA pathway and increased resistance to virulent pathogens resulting from a faster SA pathway activation. These lines exhibit also increased tolerance to chemically induced oxidative stress consistent with a known role of EDS 1 <b>and</b> <b>PAD</b> 4 in processing reactive oxygen species (ROS) - derived signals. The insufficiency of EDS 1 -PAD 4 cooverexpression to fully recapitulate defence activation implies the existence of post-translational mechanisms of regulation. The existence of regulatory post-translational modifications of the EDS 1 protein was investigated and lines expressing constitutively or conditionally activated functional epitope-tagged EDS 1 were generated. The data presented here demonstrate that EDS 1 <b>and</b> <b>PAD</b> 4 operate as a signaling unit. The basis of the observed dramatic biotic and abiotic stress phenotypes will be further investigated as it should provide important insight into EDS 1 <b>and</b> <b>PAD</b> 4 functions...|$|R

25|$|The {{new owner}} of the {{building}} was indoor soccer field developer Richard Fritz, who purchased the Majestic for $248,800. In April 2000 {{it was announced that}} local restaurateur Henry Doane would lease the theater and reopen after extensive renovations. Doane had bought the 71-year-old Orpheum Theatre (with the attached Stage Door Theater) a year earlier and installed a restaurant and bar in the lobby, making him the operator of the last three commercial movie screens in downtown Madison. Admitting publicly that he may lose money on the Majestic venture, he confessed to sentimental feelings about the theater and believed it could return to its former art house glory. Fritz and Doane spent $250,000 on a new roof, a new sound system, a larger concession stand and a first-floor restroom. Seating capacity went from 537 to 400 to provide more leg room, <b>and</b> <b>padded</b> bench seats were installed in the balcony. The theater reopened on June 30, 2000 with Hamlet starring Ethan Hawke. The Majestic became one of the venues for the growing Wisconsin Film Festival. But Doane struggled to make a profit {{in the face of the}} same competition with the Westgate and Hilldale Theaters for independent film bookings and audiences.
