The boat was laid down on 30 March 1908 and launched on 2 February 1911 with only the starboard electric motor in place. The port electric motor was under repair {{at the time and}} was installed from 3 May to 21 June and a brief series of trials were conducted. The boat was refitted and further repairs were made to the port-side motor, although continuing problems with her propulsion system often immobilized Mariotte into 1912. She was able, however, to conduct diving, torpedo and underwater speed trials in August and September 1911. The boat was lightly damaged when the <b>air</b> <b>heater</b> of a Modèle 1909R torpedo exploded in its tube on 27 December. Her diesel engines, three years delayed by problems during factory testing, were installed from 1 March to 28 July 1912. They were judged satisfactory after the oil sump and the compressors were changed. After repeated breakdowns, Mariotte conducted her testing of the diesels from 23 October to 11 December and she was finally commissioned (armament définitif) on 5 February 1913 after a complete [...] of her propulsion system.|$|E

On 31 October 2001, the ash silo which stood at the ash dock was toppled using explosives to demolish the stilts the structure stood on. The silo was then dismantled by bulldozers. All of the smaller structures had been removed by July 2002. On 11 July 2002, the A Station's boiler house was demolished. The [...] high coal conveyor belt was demolished on 6 February 2003. The station's precipitators were demolished on 27 March and 17 April 2003. On 1 May 2003, the B Station's bunker bay building was demolished, and on 22 May 2003, the stations <b>air</b> <b>heater</b> was demolished. A fire started at the station on 17 June 2003, when a bunker caught fire after hot cutting equipment set fire to coke remnants. All of the larger structures had been demolished by July 2003. It was planned for the stations' chimneys to be demolished in October 2003, but {{that had to be}} postponed due to the complexity of the demolition. However, at noon on 7 December 2003, the four chimneys, each weighing , were demolished using a total of [...] of the industrial explosive Gelemex.

40|$|Abstract — Artificial {{roughness}} applied on the {{absorber plate}} {{is the most}} efficient method to improve thermal performance of solar <b>air</b> <b>heaters.</b> Experimental investigations appropriate to distinct roughness geometries shows that the enhancement in heat transfer is accompanied by considerable rise in pumping power Several studies {{have been carried out}} to determine the effect of different roughness element geometries on heat transfer and friction in solar <b>air</b> <b>heaters.</b> The objective {{of this paper is to}} review various studies, in which different artificial roughness elements are used to enhance the heat transfer rate with little penalty of friction. Heat transfer coefficient and friction factor correlations developed by various investigators for artificially roughened ducts of solar <b>air</b> <b>heaters</b> have also been reported in the present article.

The combustion <b>air</b> <b>heater</b> can provide total pressures from 200 psia to 2,800 psia (13.6 atm to 190.5 atm) and a total temperatures from 1,200°R to 4,700°R (667 K to 2,611 K).

40|$|The {{present study}} aims to compare three {{different}} types of designed flat-plate solar <b>air</b> <b>heaters,</b> two having fins (Type II and Type III) and the other without fins (Type I), one of the heater with a fin had single glass cover (Type III) and the others had double glass covers (Type I and Type II).

Based on the energy and exergy output rates, heater with double glass covers and fins (Type II) is more effective {{and the difference between}} the input and output air temperature is higher than of the others.

40|$|Solar <b>air</b> <b>heaters</b> {{are one of}} the {{simplest}} and cost effective solar energy utilization systems for various drying applications. The thermal efficiency of solar <b>air</b> <b>heaters</b> is found to be low due to low heat transfer coefficient on the air side. Attempts have been made to enhance the heat transfer rate from the absorber plate to air by using different roughness elements. Enhancement of heat transfer coefficient is achieved by providing artificial roughness, always goes with an increment of pressure drop and more pumping power is required. So, {{there is a need to}} optimize the system parameters to maximize heat transfer, while keeping the friction losses as low as possible. In the present paper the effect of artificial roughness of various geometries and glass cover on the performance of solar <b>air</b> <b>heaters,</b> investigated and analyzed by different investigators, has been mentioned.

50|$|Each {{unit had}} two large Forced Draught (FD) Fans. For {{efficiency}} these fans drew warm air from an intake {{at the top}} of the station. This combustion air was passed through the <b>Air</b> <b>Heater</b> which increased its temperature. Dampers were used to control the quantity of air admitted to the furnace and direct some of the air to the Primary Air (PA) Fans.There were also two large Induced Air (ID) Fans on each unit. These drew the hot gases from the Boiler, through the <b>Air</b> <b>Heater</b> where the heat is transferred to the incoming combustion air. The gases were then exhausted up the chimney. The exhaust flow of these fans was also controlled by dampers in the ducting.Working in tandem the Draught plant ensured the boiler was always under a slight vacuum. This created a draw of combustion air into the boiler and an exhaust to the chimney. The exhaust gases could not be allowed to cool below a certain temperature, as there was a risk of the sulfur and nitrogen oxides in the flue gases condensing and forming acids which could have damaged the ID Fans.|$|E

50|$|Most boilers produce {{steam to}} be used at {{saturation}} temperature; that is, saturated steam. Superheated steam boilers vaporize the water and then further heat the steam in a superheater. This provides steam at much higher temperature, but can decrease the overall thermal efficiency of the steam generating plant because the higher steam temperature requires a higher flue gas exhaust temperature. There {{are several ways to}} circumvent this problem, typically by providing an economizer that heats the feed water, a combustion <b>air</b> <b>heater</b> in the hot flue gas exhaust path, or both. There are advantages to superheated steam that may, and often will, increase overall efficiency of both steam generation and its utilization: gains in input temperature to a turbine should outweigh any cost in additional boiler complication and expense. There may also be practical limitations in using wet steam, as entrained condensation droplets will damage turbine blades.|$|E

This paper represents the results on data collected under actual outdoor conditions for artificially roughened and smooth solar <b>air</b> <b>heaters</b> with and without booster mirrors. The {{results show that the}} effect of boosting of solar radiation is appreciable and consequently, the thermal efficiency of the roughened collectors with booster mirrors increases further over the roughened ones without any further increase in the pressure drop over that in the roughened ones. The values of the collector heat removal factor and collector efficiency factor of roughened solar <b>air</b> <b>heaters</b> with booster mirrors have been found to increase by 12. 6 % and 11. 9 % respectively over the roughened ones without booster mirrors and 45. 6 % and 46. 5 % respectively over the smooth ones with booster mirrors and 144. 1 % and 141 % respectively over the smooth ones.

Process heater is used in Baking, Drying, Laminating, Metal Working, Packaging, Plastic Welding, Preheating, Sealing, Soldering, Shrink Fitting, Synthetic Fabric Sewing and in other industries. But heating of air to a very high heat flux is sometimes impossible without the degradation of air quality, because many industries use combustion of gases for the purpose of heating the air to a very high heat flux. Electric heater can be alternative heating equipment, but it requires costly and long heating apparatus for the desired air temperature. In the present study, heat transfer enhancement in an <b>air</b> process <b>heater</b> was investigated both numerically and experimentally. A circular duct with 5 semi-circular hollow baffles and 4 cartridge electric heaters was designed for the process heating. Air was supplied from a wind tunnel at 3. 17 × 104 Reynolds number.
