500|$|In {{order to}} capture ghosts, Luigi must first use his {{flashlight}} {{to light up}} the ghost and stun it, revealing their heart. When this happens, players use the Poltergust 3000 to suck them up, steadily reducing the ghost's hit points to zero; the more hit points, the more {{time it takes for}} a ghost to be captured, giving them a chance to break free while leaving Luigi more exposed to being harmed; if his HP is reduced to zero from being hurt by the ghosts, the game is over. Once a ghost's HP is reduced to zero, they are captured. Some ghosts cannot be captured easily until Luigi locates three special medallions, each granting the Poltergust with the ability to suck up certain elements from the rooms and use them to capture special ghosts lying within the mansion. In addition to capturing the regular ghosts in the mansion, Luigi must also draw out special, [...] "portrait ghosts" [...] from some rooms, each requiring a condition be met to make them <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>capture.</b> Once all the ghosts in a room are captured, it brightens up; the music also changes, being pleasantly whistled by Luigi, while being haunted and spooky when filled with ghosts, with Luigi humming nervously to the tune.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a detailed {{investigation of the}} ISPP dynamics of charge-trap memory capacitors, considering not only the flat-band voltage but also the bottom oxide electric field and tunneling current evolution during programming. Differently from the floating-gate case, results on nitride-based memories show that the flat-band increase per step does not equal the step amplitude of the gate staircase, decreasing, moreover, as programming proceeds. As a consequence, the electric field and tunneling current through the bottom oxide are shown to largely increase. Using results at different temperatures and on samples with different stack compositions, this dynamics is {{explained in terms of}} a drop of the programming efficiency as more and more charge is stored in the nitride layer, due to the reduction of the number of free traps <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>capturing</b> the injected electrons...|$|R

Natives were sometimes used as labor on plantations or as servants. They were also used as interpreters for European traders.

50|$|The {{holy grail}} of alpha hunting and {{absolute}} returns is a zero-sum game, producing winners and losers. A fact that often {{seems to be}} overlooked is that performance fees, besides aligning the interest of fund managers with investors, also attain top talent. Since alpha is difficult to extract, {{the single most important}} factor of active management is the talent of the fund manager. According to a hedge fund survey in 2005, the three key risks for the fund segment is overcrowding, poor returns and mis-pricing. In effect, the argument is that due to overcrowding the alpha <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>capture</b> by hedge funds has tospread over more funds, resulting in lower returns. Furthermore, the study concluded that two in three pension funds believe that worldwide overcapacity will drive down the returns. One should underline that these risks are also noteworthy for 130-30 strategies. As an asset class hedge funds have recorded an annual return of 10.7 percent since 1994, according to CSFB/Tremont, which tracks about 400 hedge funds. That is marginally ahead of Standard & Poor’s 500 annual gains over the period of 10.4 percent. In this perspective, beta seems to offer rather attractive risk-adjusted returns over time. Conclusively, one could argue that it might be desirable to invest in a strategy that can offer both beta and the potential upsides of long-short strategies in terms of alpha generation. Nevertheless, 130-30 is first and foremost not competing with market neutral long-short funds as an investment vehicle. Instead, they should be viewed as an alternative to long-only funds, where managers can use short selling as a possible additional source of alpha.|$|E

The degree of widening depends largely on neutron-capture rates near closed neutron shells and relatively close to stability.

30|$|CO 2 capture can be {{performed}} in three main fashions: pre-combustion, post-combustion, and oxy-firing [42]. A broad range of technology options are <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>capturing</b> CO 2 including physical absorption, chemical absorption, membrane separation, and cryogenic separation [42, 43]. Within UCG, the syngas compositions, temperatures, and pressures of production streams at the exit of a production well are {{comparable to those of}} surface gasifiers, which allow similar methods of CO 2 capture. Due to similarities, it is believed that UCG syngas could take advantage of separation using physical sorbents, within a pre-combustion arrangement, which has costs comparable to capture technologies commonly utilized in integrated gasification combined cycles [4, 12]. Post-combustion methods are also applicable and would be directly comparable in terms of cost and performance to typical post-combustion systems utilized in power plants. Oxy-firing options are possible for UCG as well, and within a power generating scenario, an air separation unit can generate O 2 streams for injection into the UCG and for use in an oxy-fired plant utilizing the syngas [12].|$|R

Cameras are becoming commercially <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>capturing</b> real-world light fields. However, capturing high spatial resolution light fields remains technologically challenging, and the images rendered from real light fields have today a significantly lower spatial resolution compared to traditional 2 D cameras. This paper describes an example-based super-resolution algorithm for light fields, which allows the increase of the spatial resolution of the different views in a consistent manner across all sub-aperture images of the light field. The algorithm learns linear projections between subspaces of reduced dimension in which reside patch-volumes extracted from the light field. The method is extended to cope with angular super-resolution, where 2 D patches of intermediate sub-aperture images are approximated from neighbouring sub-aperture images using multivariate ridge regression. Experimental results show significant quality improvement when compared to state-of-the-art single-image super-resolution methods applied on each view separately, as well as when compared to a recent light field super-resolution techniques based on deep learning...|$|R

Solitary individuals were consistently observed resting directly on the lake bottom at depths of 15 - 35 m (Davis et al., 1997).
