5|$|Shortly {{before she}} turned 15, Falle met two child prostitutes {{who were also}} in their early teens. One of these girls was {{pregnant}} by her 42-year-old pimp. The two girls offered Falle <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> at their apartment while their pimp was away; feeling there was no alternative, she accepted. Out of concern for Falle's safety, they {{taught her how to}} put a condom on a penis by practicing on a cucumber. These children effectively groomed Falle. She stayed at the apartment for several days, and she was watched by various men. By the time the pimp returned, Falle had moved on.|$|E
5|$|Daily {{routine of}} life in the {{trenches}} began with the morning 'stand-to'. An hour before dawn everyone was roused and ordered to man their positions to guard against a dawn raid by the Germans. With stand-to over, {{it was time for the}} men to have breakfast and perform ablutions. Once complete, the NCOs would assign daily chores, before the men attended to the cleaning of rifles and equipment, filling sandbags, repairing trenches or digging latrines. Once the daily tasks had been completed the men who were off-duty would find <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Due to the constant bombardments and the sheer effort of trying to stay alive, sleep deprivation was common. Soldiers also had to take it in turns to be on sentry duty, watching for enemy movements.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, housing {{policy has been}} a devolved matter, and state support for the homeless, {{together}} with legal rights in housing, have therefore diverged to a certain degree. A national service, called Streetlink, was established in 2012 to help {{members of the public}} obtain near-immediate assistance for specific rough sleepers, {{with the support of the}} Government (as housing is a devolved matter, the service currently only extends to England). Currently, the service does not operate on a statutory basis, and the involvement of local authorities is merely due to political pressure from the government and charities, with funding being provided by the government (and others) on an ad-hoc basis. A member of the public who is concerned that someone is sleeping on the streets can report the individual's details via the Street Link website or by calling the referral line number on 0300 500 0914. Someone who finds themselves sleeping on the streets can also report their situation using the same methods. It is important to note that the Streetlink service is for those who are genuinely sleeping on the streets, and not those who may merely be begging, or ostensibly living their life on the streets despite <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> elsewhere (such as a hostel or supported accommodation).|$|E
500|$|Sex Trade 101 {{calls itself}} [...] "Toronto's only sex trade {{survivors}} and abolitionist organization" [...] and {{is composed of}} 12 women who had escaped forced prostitution and who offer training for police in order to change perceptions about {{people involved in the}} sex trade. The organization is also involved in prevention work in high schools. The organization offers mentorship and peer support groups for women who are currently or were formerly in prostitution. It also partners with other organizations including the Servants Anonymous Society of Calgary and Sheatre, an Owen Sound-based interactive theatre company. In 2012, Falle and Bridget Perrier represented Sex Trade 101 in Owen Sound where they launched ReStart, a mentorship program to aid women and youth who are at risk of sexual victimization, to help people exit the sex trade, and to provide support once they have exited. At the workshop that launched this program, Falle said that some people in the sex industry engage in survival sextrading sex for food, <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> alcohol, drugs, or the feeling that they are loved. She said that rural communities are common places for women and children to be groomed into prostitution. She identified Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound as particularly vulnerable because of the substance abuse in the area. By 2013, Sex Trade 101 had served more than 1,000 women. In May 2012, Falle spoke about human trafficking at high schools in Vancouver primarily because of the influence of a parent concerned about human trafficking in the area and its dangers to children.|$|E

2500|$|During {{her middle}} school years, IU found {{her passion for}} singing and {{decided to become a}} singer after being applauded for a {{performance}} she gave at her school's sports competition. She attended 20 auditions but failed all of them, and was also scammed by fake entertainment companies. Before joining LOEN Entertainment in 2007, IU trained at Good Entertainment with Uee, Yubin, Heo Ga-yoon, and Jun Hyoseong. After signing with LOEN, IU moved to Bangbae, Seoul. Despite thinking that she might eventually be put into a girl group after three to four years of training, she received ten months of training before her solo debut in 2008. Due to her living conditions at the time, IU stated that she [...] "loved being at the studio", where she could eat as much as she wanted and had <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Prior to her debut, LOEN coined her stage name [...] "IU", deriving it from the phrase [...] "I and You" [...] to symbolize the unifying force of music between people.|$|E

[...] On Good Friday 1989, the rebels came to St. Mary's to abduct several Italian nuns.

[...] Until the Ebola outbreak, 9000 people sought sanctuary on the hospital grounds nightly to sleep. [...] In a later incident, Lukwiya, his wife Margaret and five children were lying in bed one evening listening to nearby fighting between the rebels and government forces when a mortar shell crashed through the ceiling of their house, but failed to explode. He also played an unpublicised role in advocating for a peaceful solution to the war.|$|E

2500|$|Around {{the late}} 2000s, in Santa Barbara {{and other areas}} in California, groups of {{recently}} homeless began to camp out in their cars in parking lots with the coordinated support of a local non-profit group. These individuals and families were often unable to afford rent or mortgage, but still had jobs, cars, insurance {{and other types of}} support structures. In Santa Barbara, an estimated 55 individuals camped out every night in various private and public lots, some reserved for women only. As more people began to camp in their vehicles, California cities began to [...] pass laws against sleeping in vehicles, like the 2013 ordinance passed in Palo Alto. However, many of these laws in different municipalities were later struck down in higher courts as unconstitutional, like the Los Angeles ban which was judged by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2014. Some cities chose to repeal their own bans on sleeping in vehicles. In Los Angeles in 2015, approximately 9,500 homeless have turned their cars into homes. In Hawaii, a Honolulu-based company is retrofitting five retired city buses into mobile shelters which provide <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> and get a shower.|$|E
2500|$|Jewish Brigade soldiers, {{assisting}} {{with the}} Berihah, specifically {{took advantage of}} the chaotic situation in post-war Europe to move Holocaust survivors between countries and across borders. [...] Soldiers were intentionally placed by Merkaz Lagolah at transfer points and border crossings to assist the Jewish DPs (displaced persons). [...] For example, Judenberg, a sub-camp of the Mauthausen concentration camp, acted as a Berihah point where Brigade soldiers and partisans worked together to assist DPs. Similarly, in the city of Graz, a Berihah point was centred in a hotel where a legendary Berihah figure, Pinchas Zeitag, also known as Pini the Red or “Gingi,” organised transports westwards to Italy. [...] One of the Jewish Brigade's greatest contributions to the Berihah was the use of their British Army vehicles to transport survivors (up to a thousand people at a time) in truck convoys to Pontebba, the brigade's motor depot. [...] These secret transports generally arrived at 2 or 3 a.m., and the Brigade always ensured that DPs were greeted by a soldier or an officer and welcomed into a dining hall with food and tea. [...] Everyone was given a medical examination, <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> and clean clothing; and within a few days the group was moved to hachsharot in Bari, Bologna and Modena. [...] After recuperating and completing their hachshara training, the DPs were taken to ports where boats would illegally set sail for Mandatory Palestine. Historians estimate that the Jewish Brigade assisted in the transfer, between 1945 and 1948, of 15,000 - 22,000 Jewish DPs as part of the Berihah and the illegal immigration movement.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 March 1969, {{five years}} and twelve days after she left her husband, gravely ill, Meena Kumari {{reported}} for work again on Pakeezah. Kamal Amrohi organized a great reception. He gave his wife a peda (sweet) as a peace offering and made a documentary film on her arrival at the studio. Meena Kumari was determined to complete the film and, {{well aware of the}} limited time left for her to live, went {{out of her way to}} complete it at the earliest. Despite her rapidly deteriorating health, she gave the finishing touches to her performance. Vinod Mehta (writer of Meena Kumari - The Classic Biography) shared an incident which occurred during the last days of the shooting of Pakeezah: [...] "On outdoor shooting Kamal Amrohi's unit travelled in two cars near a place called Shivpuri in Madhya Pradesh, the cars all but ran out of petrol, and for miles around there was nothing except a long, deserted, straight road. It was discovered that a bus passed on this route every morning from which fuel could be purchased. Kamal Amrohi decided to spend the night in the desert; he ordered his unit to roll up the windows of the cars and hope for the best. A little after midnight the occupants of the vehicles were surrounded by a dozen armed men. The men knocked on the closed windows and forced their way in. When the armed gang leader learned that one of the people in the car was Meena Kumari, his attitude completely changed. He turned out to be a Meena Kumari fan, and welcomed his guests in true fan tradition. He organized music, dancing, and food. He provided <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> He instructed his juniors the next morning to fetch petrol for the unit. From Meena Kumari, he wanted a special favor. He sharpened his knife and took it to her. [...] "Please autograph my hand with this", he requested. Meena was not new to signing autographs but she had never attempted anything as ambitious as a knife. Nervously, she wrote her name on this man's hand. He said he was grateful for this favor. Once the unit left, they found at the next town that they had spent the night in the camp of Madhya Pradesh's renowned and dangerous dacoit - Amrit Lal." ...|$|E
