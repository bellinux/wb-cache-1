60|$|The {{favourite}} of the Canaries is, or was, the vidonia, a juicy berry, mostly white, seldom black: {{the same}} {{is the case with}} the muscadels. The Malvasia is rarely cultivated, as it suffered inordinately from the vine-disease. The valuable Verdelho, preferred at Madeira, is, or was, a favourite; and there are, or were, half a dozen others. The vendange usually began in the lowlands about the end of August, and in the uplands a fortnight or three weeks later. The grape was carried in large baskets by men, women, and children, to the lagar, or wooden press, and was there trodden down, as in Madeira, Austria, and Italy. The Canarians, like other neo-Latins an unmechanical race, care little for economising labour. The vinification resembled that of the Isle of Wood, with one important exception--the stove.

40|$|There are two {{problems}} with the shortwave penetration scheme used in Modular Ocean Model version 3 (MOM 3) : (i) the spatiotemporal variability of {{the thickness of the}} first layer resulting from the free surface is not considered, and (ii) shortwave irradiance penetrates the ocean bottom. Because both of these problems can cause <b>artificial</b> <b>heat</b> sources or sinks, their effects are evaluated in the present study using a MOM 3 -based ocean general circulation model. The first problem creates an <b>artificial</b> <b>heat</b> sink (source) in the regions of positive (negative) sea surface height (SSH) with a maximum amplitude greater than 10 W m- 2 and decreases (increases) sea surface temperature (SST) by up to 0. 3 °C on the basis of annual mean. This change in SST leads to a reduction in global mean evaporation and, as a result, an increase in SSH, which enhances the <b>artificial</b> <b>heat</b> sink. After several years of integration, this positive feedback amplifies the effects of the first problem in cases of stand-alone ocean simulations forced by freshwater flux. The estimated <b>artificial</b> <b>heat</b> sink induced by the second problem reaches 50 W m- 2, and the decrease in SST exceeds 1. 0 °C. However, the effects of this problem are restricted within shallow coastal areas and do not involve positive feedback...|$|R

40|$|Although stingless {{bees are}} capable of {{maintaining}} their nest temperature within certain limits, brood production of several species declines or even completely stops during periods of low ambient temperature. In the present study, we investigated whether the brood production of the meliponine species Nannotrigona testaceicornis can be artificially increased through heating the colonies during the cold season. For this, we monitored the rate of brood cell production of seven hives in intervals of 24 hours under two different experimental conditions: 1. without; and 2. with heating. Each treatment (first with and subsequently without heating) lasted for nine consecutive days. The ambient temperature (TA) during both experimental periods was very similar (TA(WITH) = 16. 1 degrees C; TA(WITHOUT) = 16. 3 degrees C). On average, the colonies built 3. 6 brood cells per day without and 15. 8 brood cells per day with <b>artificial</b> <b>heating</b> (Wilcoxon Rank Sum test: T = 10, Z = 4, P < 0. 001). In both treatments, the rate of brood cell production increased with increasing environmental temperature (Spearman Rank Correlation: R(WITH) = 0. 71, P = 0. 02; R(WITHOUT) = 0. 66, P = 0. 05).

As pointed out above, the backscatter from 15 : 40 to 16 : 20 UT {{is difficult to}} attribute to purely <b>artificial</b> <b>heating.</b> From approximately 16 : 25 UT onwards, the backscatter power is clearly associated with ionospheric pumping and remains relatively constant despite the pump beam direction changing. This indicates that striations are forming and they are growing to saturation. Wright et al. ([2006]) showed that striations grow to saturation rapidly {{and once in a}} preconditioned ionosphere, as is the case here, they are maintained for very low pump powers. The consequence of this is that striations are saturated for all pumping directions, yet the optical emission intensity varies strongly with aspect angle. This suggests that the suprathermal electron acceleration mechanism relies on pump power being directed along the striations which maximises when the pump beam is pointed along the magnetic field-aligned direction.|$|E
