5|$|In May 2007, U.S. diplomats {{spoke with}} the TFG's Ambassador to Ethiopia. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>topics</b> of {{conversation}} were Somali security forces, and Ambassador Abdulkarim Farah said that the TFG had trained nearly 7,000 militia in Baledogle who were now patrolling throughout Somalia, from Kismayo to Puntland. Another 3,500 militia were undergoing training. Farah said that on May 18 he planned to his hometown of Beledweyne to establish a militia training camp there, at the instruction of President Yusuf. Farah estimated that approximately 60 per cent of the militia were Darod, 30 per cent were Hawiye, and the remaining 10 per cent were from other clans; the majority of security forces in Mogadishu were Darod. He said that the TFG had not sought to exclude Darod from the militia, and attributed the imbalance to Hawiye having primarily supported the Council of Islamic Courts (CIC).|$|E

40|$|This paper studies text {{summarization}} by extracting hierarchical topics from a given {{collection of}} documents. We propose {{a new approach}} of text modeling via network analysis. We convert documents into a word influence network, and find the words summarizing <b>the</b> major <b>topics</b> with an efficient influence maximization algorithm. Besides, the influence capability of <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> words on other words in the network reveal <b>the</b> relations <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> words. Then we cluster the words and build hierarchies for <b>the</b> <b>topics.</b> Experiments on large collections of Web documents show that a simple method based on the influence analysis is effective, compared with existing generative topic modeling and random walk based ranking...|$|R

Songs like Sarhoş Kızlar (Drunken Girls) or Şoför Kadınlar (Women Drivers) were sung seemingly in revenge for all the suffering they had endured at the hands of men in the past. Other topical songs include Daktilo (The Typewriter) which brought to mind the newly formed Secretaires 7 Society. Songs such as Bereli Kız (The Girl with the Beret) and Kadın Asker Olursa (If Women Were Soldiers) were full of mockery and ridicule.|$|E

25|$|Between 1876 and 1884 Asquith {{supplemented}} {{his income}} by writing regularly for The Spectator, which {{at that time}} had a broadly Liberal outlook. Matthew comments that the articles Asquith wrote for the magazine give a good overview of his political views as a young man. He was staunchly radical, but as unconvinced by extreme left-wing views as by Toryism. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>topics</b> that caused debate among Liberals were British imperialism, the union of Great Britain and Ireland, and female suffrage. Asquith was a strong, though not jingoistic, proponent of the Empire, and, after initial caution, came to support home rule for Ireland. He opposed votes for women {{for most of his}} political career. There was also an element of party interest: Asquith believed that votes for women would disproportionately benefit the Conservatives. In a 2001 study of the extension of the franchise between 1832 and 1931, Bob Whitfield concluded that Asquith's surmise about the electoral impact was correct. In addition to his work for The Spectator, he was retained as a leader writer by The Economist, taught at evening classes, and marked examination papers.|$|E

Achebe indicated that it was not [...] "a very significant question", and that scholars would do well to wait until a body of work were large enough to judge. Writing about the conference in several journals, Achebe hailed it as a milestone for the literature of Africa, and highlighted the importance of community among isolated voices on the continent and beyond.|$|E

"Maman a tort" [...] {{lays the}} {{foundation}} of Farmer's musical universe, including many themes dealt with by the singer in subsequent releases. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>topics</b> discussed are transgression, love, the world of childhood, violence and death, mortality and suffering, sexuality, and social demands. The song also deals with psychoanalysis. The rhythm is catchy, and the lyrics, [...] "dark and symbolic", describe the conflicts between a daughter and her mother, as the title suggests. According to an analysis published by Sophie Khairallah, the lyrics could also refer to incest. They seem to be [...] "innocent" [...] and are sung [...] "in the most ingenuous way". Biographer Bernard Violet considers the song [...] "a nursery rhyme with enigmatic but quite spicy lyrics which place it rather far from Sabine Paturel and her innocent song [...] "Les Bêtises"". Journalist Caroline Bee deemed the song as [...] "a small efficient UFO, with a catchy and binary melody and a disconcerting video".|$|E
500|$|Prawer {{was part}} of a cadre of historians, {{including}} Claude Cahen and Jean Richard, who freed crusader studies from the old conception of crusader society as an exemplar of pure, unchanging feudalism that spontaneously emerged from the conquest. [...] This view, which originated with feudal jurists in the thirteenth century, was held to by modern historians since the early thirties. [...] Through the work of Prawer, particularly his two papers from the fifties, and his colleagues, crusader society began to be seen as dynamic, with the nobility gradually putting checks on the monarchy. The combined efforts of these historians led to a surge of new research into crusader society. Prawer's research extended {{to a wide variety of}} other aspects of the crusader states. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>topics</b> he addressed were land development projects and urban settlement, agriculture, the Italian quarters of port cities, the types of landed property, and legal issues in the Assises des Bourgeois.|$|E
