A representative of the archdiocese said with regards to the mislabeled photograph that [...] "The implication is that Cardinal Faulhaber was an associate of the Nazis. When one writes <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> one should be more precise about the truth." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{publication}} of the leaked material, particularly the diplomatic cables, attracted in-depth coverage worldwide, with several governments blocking websites that contained embarrassing details. Alan Rusbridger, editor of The Guardian, said: [...] "I can't think {{of a time when}} there was ever a story generated by a news organisation where the White House, the Kremlin, Chávez, India, China, everyone in the world was talking <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b> ... I've never known a story that created such mayhem that wasn't an event like a war or a terrorist attack." ...|$|E
500|$|The Kite Runner {{has been}} accused of 'hindering' Western {{understanding}} of the Taliban by portraying its members as representatives of various social and doctrinal evils that the Taliban and their supporters do not consider typical and which they feel portray Taliban in an unfavourable light. Examples of this would be: Assef's pedophilia, Nazism, drug abuse, and sadism, {{and the fact that he}} is an executioner. The American Library Association reported that The Kite Runner was one of its most-challenged books of 2008, with multiple attempts to remove it from libraries due to its [...] "offensive language, sexually explicit , and unsuit age group." [...] Afghan American readers were particularly hostile towards the depiction of Pashtuns as oppressors and Hazaras as the oppressed. Hosseini responded in an interview, [...] "They never say I am speaking about things that are untrue. Their beef is, 'Why do you have to talk <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> and embarrass us? Don't you love your country?'" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{open-ended}} {{nature of}} the lyrics has led to many interpretations. Journalist Michael Campbell believed the lyrics send [...] "a message of hope" [...] and wish for a [...] "world that is not divided by class, wealth, race, or any other arbitrary criterion". With regard to the place Bono was referring to in the song, he said, [...] "I'm not sure, really, about that. I used {{to think it was}} Belfast..." [...] Journalist Niall Stokes believes the title was influenced by Bono's and his wife Ali's visit to Ethiopia as volunteer aid-workers. Bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open-ended lyrics: [...] "I can look at it now and recognize that [...] {{has one of the most}} banal couplets in the history of pop music. But it also contains some of the biggest ideas. In a curious way, that seems to work. If you get any way heavy <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> you don't communicate. But if you're flip or throwaway about it, then you do. That's one of the paradoxes I've come to terms with." ...|$|E

He got Adrian Fisher for that, and he involved him {{in all of the}} political and other activities that he himself was involved in. The Secretary of State always is involved in a lot of controversial things, and here we had the McCarthy era, the attack on the whole concept of Foreign Service and the State Department, and a terrific controversy over what to do about China, who had [...] "lost China." [...] Fisher was always at Acheson's right hand when he was dealing with other people <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b> Wherever he went, Fisher's office was backstopping him, getting all the necessary background information so he'd be prepared for any kind of question that came up. Of course, Acheson's own approach to being Secretary of State was such that when you took an agreement to him to be signed, his chief question was [...] "By what authority do I sign this?" [...] And whoever brought it to him to get it signed, had to be ready with the answer that would satisfy a lawyer -- [...] "by what legal authority" [...] -- as well as what it provides and so forth.|$|E

2500|$|After his nomination, Jackson {{received}} backlash {{for some}} of his past statements that have been perceived as derogatory to gays, blacks, and Democrats. Jackson and some observers have noted the challenge of differentiating between statements made in a ministry setting and those made in a political setting. Jackson said, [...] "I {{have been forced to}} clarify those views because they went back and picked out ministry settings where I talked <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> and brought them into my campaign. Then I feel like I {{have no choice but to}} clarify." [...] Coby Dillard, a Norfolk Republican, observed that some of the criticism stems from the fact that commentary acceptable in a church setting is received differently in a political campaign. Jackson said that by critiquing his comments made in a ministry context, his opponents were trying to impose a religious test to say that anyone who takes a traditional view of the Bible is unfit for public office.|$|E
2500|$|Wyatt and Holliday {{had been}} fast friends since Holliday saved Earp's life in Dodge City during 1878. During their stay in Albuquerque, {{the two men}} ate at The Retreat Restaurant owned by [...] "Fat Charlie". [...] Otero wrote in his letter, [...] "Holiday said {{something}} about Earp becoming 'a damn Jew-boy.' Earp became angry and left…. [...] Jaffa told me later that Earp’s woman was a Jewess. Earp did mezuzah when entering the house." [...] Earp's anger at Holliday's ethnic slur may indicate that his feelings for Josephine was more serious at the time than is commonly known. The information in the letter is compelling {{because at the time}} it was written in the 1940s, the relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus while living in Tombstone was virtually unknown. The only way Otero could write <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> was if he had a personal relationship with some of the individuals involved. The Earp party split up in Albuquerque, and Holliday and Dan Tipton rode on to Pueblo, while the rest of the group headed for Gunnison.|$|E
2500|$|Jacques Derrida {{makes an}} {{extensive}} {{study on the}} untranslatable concept of what is at once a [...] "'remedy, 'recipe,' 'drug,' 'philter,' etc.", namely, the pharmakon. During this study, Derrida not only divulges the exact instances Socrates or his interlocutors make use of this concept, but also reveals the relationship between Plato and Socrates which scholars have kept in secret by questioning the validity of authorship in Plato's letters, where in the Second Letter Socrates writes: [...] "Consider these facts and take care lest you sometimes come to repent of having now unwisely published your views. It is a very great safeguard to learn by heart instead of writing. It is impossible for what is written not to be disclosed (to me graphein all' ekmanthanein). [...] That {{is the reason why}} I have never written anything <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> and why there is not and will not be any written work of Plato's own (oud' estin sungramma Platonos ouden oud' estai). What are now called his are the work of a Socrates embellished and modernized (Sokratous estin kalou kai neou gegonotos). [...] Farewell and believe. Read this letter now at once many times and burn it." [...] (Letter II, 314) ...|$|E

2500|$|Sergi López as Captain Vidal, Ofelia's new {{stepfather}} and a Falange officer. Del Toro {{met with}} López in Barcelona, {{a year and}} a half before filming began, to ask him to play Vidal. In Spain, López was considered a melodramatic or comedic actor, and the producers told Del Toro [...] "You should be very careful because you don't know <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> because you're Mexican, but this guy is not going to be able to deliver the performance"; del Toro replied [...] "Well, it's not that I don't know, it's that I don't care". Of his character, López said: [...] "He is the most evil character I've ever played in my career. It is impossible to improve upon it; the character is so solid and so well written. Vidal is deranged, a psychopath who is impossible to defend. Even though his father's personality marked his existence—and is certainly one of the reasons for his mental disorder—that cannot be an excuse. It would seem to be very cynical to use that to justify or explain his cruel and cowardly acts. I think it is great that the film does not consider any justification of fascism." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Roy Strong, Fear of {{the wrong}} use and {{perception}} of the visual image dominates the Elizabethan age. The old pre-Reformation idea of images, religious ones, was that they partook of {{the essence of what}} they depicted. Any advance in technique which could reinforce that experience was embraced. That was now reversed, indeed it may account for the Elizabethans failing to take cognisance of the optical advances which created the art of the Italian Renaissance. They certainly knew <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> but, and this is central {{to the understanding of the}} Elizabethans, chose not to employ them. Instead the visual arts retreated in favour of presenting a series of signs or symbols through which the viewer was meant to pass to an understanding of the idea behind the work. In this manner the visual arts were verbalised, turned into a form of book, a 'text' which called for reading by the onlooker. There are no better examples of this than the quite extraordinary portraits of the queen herself, which increasingly, as the reign progressed, took on the form of collections of abstract pattern and symbols disposed in an unnaturalistic manner for the viewer to unravel, and by doing so enter into an inner vision of the idea of monarchy." ...|$|E

[...] But Clarke {{did not use}} ESP in any of his later stories, saying [...] "I've {{always been interested in}} ESP and, of course, Childhood's End was about that.
