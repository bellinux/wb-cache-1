His first paper was published in 1950, and dealt with the detection of incomplete antibodies using trypsinized erythrocytes in a plasmatic medium, a technique that displayed improved sensitivity over other techniques used at the time. He went on to publish more works {{in the field of}} hematology, including developing a technique in 1952 for the removal of plasma from red blood cells to be used in transfusions to patients somehow intolerant of whole blood transfusions. In 1952 he returned to France and continued his research, particularly focusing on hemolytic anemia, and publishing several works dealing with various forms of blood cell agglutination. It was during this period of research, in 1954, when Dausset first observed an anti-leucocyte <b>agglutinating</b> <b>substance,</b> though it was not until 1958 that he identified an isoantibody specific to leucocytes, and published his findings. It was this finding and the extensive cascade of work that followed that would ultimately earn Dausset his Nobel Prize! ...|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of <b>agglutinating</b> <b>substances</b> reactive with autologous and isologous human gamma globulin (yG) {{has been recognized}} for some time. These substances were first found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and were consequently termed "rheumatoid factor " (RF). It {{is now clear that}} rheumatoid factor is not specific for rheumatoid arthritis, but occurs in individuals {{with a wide variety of}} other diseases characterized by inflamma-tion, infection, and/or granulomatous formation. Hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, leprosy, syphilis, and subacute bacterial endocarditis are but a few of the other diseases unrelated to rheumatoid arthritis in which some degree ofRF activity has been observed. RF has been detected in a high proportio...|$|R
40|$|A {{substance}} in the serum {{of the marine}} gastropod, Aplysia californica, capable of agglutinating marine bacteria and vertebrate red blood cells was subjected to physicochemical analysis in order to ascertain its possible nature. Our studies indicate that agglutinating activity {{is due to a}} heterogeneous group of high molecular weight molecules with two activity peaks exhibiting sedimentation coefficients centering ∼ 18. 5 S and ∼ 31. 0 S. This material has a protein component associated with the active site since it is sensitive to heat, pH extremes, and extraction with 2 -mercaptoethanol, phenol, chloroform, and trichloracetic acid. Its physicochemical characteristics are different from other known invertebrate <b>agglutinating</b> <b>substances</b> and from classical vertebrate antibody. © 1971...|$|R
40|$|Polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) {{were found}} to damage human {{fibroblast}} monolayers. Allogeneic and autochthonous PMN were equally efficient and monolayer destruction (plaque-formation) occurred within 24 hr, as a rule, {{in the absence of}} <b>agglutinating</b> <b>substances</b> such as phytohaemagglutinin. Living PMN were not necessary for plaque-formation, since cells heated to 56 °C for 30 min or disintegrated by ultrasound were still competent to produce plaques. It is suggested that enzymes enclosed in cytoplasmic granules in the PMN are responsible for plaque-formation. Although the monolayer was destroyed, the target cells were not killed after treatment with PMN, but detached {{from the surface of the}} culture vessel into the medium and could be recultivated from the supernatant. Heparin, chondroitin sulphate and trypan blue suppressed plaque-formation by intact and disintegrated PMN, while a variety of metabolic inhibitors or X-rays had no effect...|$|R
40|$|Normal human {{umbilical}} cord serum and matched maternal serum {{were found to}} contain haemagglutinating substances with specificity for determinants found on Bence Jones (BJ) proteins. A majority of the cord sera examined contain such agglutinators for some type L BJ protein but only rarely for type K proteins. Cord serum agglutinators were found in concentrations which exceeded those of the matched maternal serum and a minority of cord sera contained such agglutinators {{in the absence of}} similar activity in the maternal serum. This is felt to constitute strong presumptive evidence of their foetal origin. The <b>agglutinating</b> <b>substances</b> in both the cord and maternal sera behaved as macroproteins on gel filtration chromatography and were sensitive to mercaptoethanol treatment. Cord sera, in contrast to maternal sera, were almost uniformly devoid of other macroprotein antibody activity such as Forssman antibody, antibody to γG-globulin and ABO saline antibody when the latter were sought in maternal—newborn combinations incompatible for these erythrocyte antigens...|$|R
40|$|Owing to {{unavoidable}} circumstances only {{a limited}} amount of time was available for the work on agglutination. The foregoing report is therefore preliminary only and the following conclusions are provisionally offered: I. Pneumococci by reason of their agglutinating properties exhibit a tendency to separate into numerous groups similar to streptococci. II. Pneumococcus mucosus forms a distinct and consistent variety. The production by it of common agglutinins for some pneumococci and the resistance of the agglutinins produced by it to absorption by the streptococcus indicate a nearer relation to the former than to the latter organism. III. The <b>agglutinating</b> <b>substances</b> in the serum of immunized animals were demonstrated by absorption tests to consist of specific and group agglutinins in cases where the agglutinins were sufficiently developed to make use of this method. IV. The pneumococci seem to show marked differences in their ability to undergo agglutination. V. There was considerable uniformity of reaction of the various strains in low dilutions, but this uniformity is not continued as the animal becomes more highly immunized. VI. At present {{it is not possible to}} establish a definite relation between the agglutination reaction and the other characteristics of the pneumococcus excepting in the case of the Pneumococcus mucosus...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown by our {{experiments}} that the serum of rabbits treated with emulsions of Treponema pallidum contains <b>agglutinating</b> <b>substances.</b> Normal rabbit serum also possesses agglutinating power for this organism, but, {{as in the case}} of normal bacterial agglutinins, to an extent very much inferior to that possessed by the sera of immunized animals. Normal human sera will agglutinate similar pallidum emulsions, as will the sera of certain syphilitic patients with positive Wassermann reactions. Whether or not there is a quantitative difference of diagnostic value between the sera of normal human beings and those of syphilitics remains to be seen. The sera of rabbits immunized with strain A agglutinate Noguchi's strain 9 in dilutions as high as 1 to 500. We regard as the most important result of these experiments the demonstration of definite antibodies in the circulation of animals treated with dead emulsions of Treponema pallidum. Since it is our belief that the agglutinating effect is due to an antibody essentially the same as that which produces bactericidal, precipitating, and opsonic effects, i. e., that there is probably one type of antibody only, we believe that the demonstration of agglutinins establishes the fact that in syphilis as in bacterial diseases the host responds by the formation of antibodies or sensitizers specific for the treponema. Spirocheticidal experiments with these sera, both in vitro and in vivo, are in progress...|$|R
40|$|<b>Agglutinating</b> <b>substances</b> having {{characteristics}} of naturally occurring macroglobulin antibodies to human Bence Jones proteins {{have been identified}} in human sera. By means of hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition techniques, common determinants have been demonstrated on the light (L) polypeptide chains of pooled normal human γ 2 -globulin and on some Bence Jones proteins of group 1 but not of group 2. Individual human sera serve to delineate subgroups of the two major antigenic groups of the Bence Jones proteins by agglutinating cells coated by one but not another protein of the same antigenic group. The complexity of subgroups, especially of group 2, is established by testing a panel of Bence Jones proteins of the same group for their ability to inhibit hemagglutination. By this means it appeared that different sera recognized different group-specific determinants of cells coated with a single Bence Jones protein. The capacity of the L polypeptide chains and proteolytic fragments of γ 2 -globulin to inhibit the hemagglutination reaction between Bence Jones protein or L chain-coated cells and human sera was examined. These studies demonstrated that the determinants, toward which agglutinators of human serum are directed, appear to be blocked in intact γ 2 -globulin and in all fragments in which H chain remains in proximity to L chain. It would appear that the presence of H chains bound to L chains by non-covalent bonds completely obstructs the reactivity of the involved L chain groups. The agglutinating capacity of a serum toward Bence Jones proteins or L chains of γ 2 -globulin appeared to be independent of its agglutinating capacity for cells coated with intact γ 2 -globulin. No correlation of the presence in serum of agglutinators for Bence Jones proteins or L chains with health or disease has been established...|$|R
40|$|Cork is {{the bark}} of Quercus suber tree. This bark has an amazing number of {{possible}} uses, particularly {{for the production of}} cork stoppers. Metals in cork can come from different sources; it could be from the field or the different industrial process that the cork suffers before the transformation to the final product [1]. There are different types of corks such as natural cork that is a 100 % natural product, agglomerated stoppers which can be manufactured by individual moulding or extrusion, and in both methods, the <b>agglutinated</b> <b>substance</b> used to connect the cork granules is approved for the use in food contact materials. These stoppers are entirely made from granulated cork from sub-products from the production of natural cork. In the present work, cork samples from different steps of the industry process were analysed. The following chemical elements were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) : Vanadium (V), Chromium (Cr), Nickel (Ni), Arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd), Selenium (Se), Lead (Pb), Cobalt (Co), Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu), Manganese (Mn) and Strontium (Sr). The method for sample preparation of cork stoppers consisted on grinding and homogenizing samples, followed by an acid-assisted microwave digestion to destroy the organic matrix. For quality control purposes parameters such as repeatability, linearity of the calibration curve, blanks or recovery of spiked samples were monitored and complied with the acceptance criteria established by the laboratory. Several elements were present in the samples in amounts above the quantification limits (ppb or ppt level). However, and according to European legislation [2], the total amount of the elements found was always below the maximum limit. We may conclude that there’s no contamination of the chemical elements during the manufacturing process of agglomerated cork stoppers...|$|R
30|$|K. marxianus is yeast {{species with}} high biotechnological potential, {{due to its}} ability to {{use a variety of}} {{substrates}} and its high growth rate under aerobic conditions (Fonseca et al. [2008]). The aim of the present work was to engineer an inducible flocculation phenotype into the non flocculent CECT 11769 strain of K. marxianus (Serrat et al. [2002]) for the purpose of industrial co-production of endopolygalacturonase (EPG) and ethanol (Serrat et al. [2004]). We chose the CECT 11769 strain because, while displaying the typical properties of the species, its EPG production is not repressed by high glucose concentrations; additionally, this strain exhibits one of the highest specific growth ratios so far described (Serrat et al. [2011]). The flocculating phenotype is an important trait in ethanol-producing yeast strains, since it protects the yeast from the negative effects of ethanol (Hu et al. [2005]) as well as providing a cheap form of yeast cell immobilization for continuous fermentations, with more volumetric productivity. In this way we could overcome the lower ethanol tolerance of K. marxianus, as compared to S. cerevisiae, and its lower EPG production, as compared to filamentous fungi (Fonseca et al. [2008]). Furthermore, the currently used procedure of yeast cell immobilization, using <b>agglutinating</b> <b>substances,</b> for ethanol production, is often detrimental, rather than advantageous. This is because this procedure can affect the ethanol production itself (or another primary metabolite), apart from directly adding an extra cost to the industrial procedure, where commercial margins are already narrow (Zhao et al. [2009]). Here we report the construction of a K. marxianus CECT 11769 strain with an inducible flocculating phenotype. This was accomplished by expressing the S. cerevisiae FLO 5 gene under the control of K. marxianus CECT 11769 native EPG 1 promoter. This promoter allows the induction of the flocculation phenotype by anaerobic conditions, without glucose repression. FLO 1 and FLO 9 genes were not considered because, when over-expressed, they reduced the yeast growth ratio (Van Mulders et al. [2009]).|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{reported}} {{the capacity of the}} lectin, concanavalin A, to agglutinate selected cell-types. The finding that cells transformed in culture, embryonic cells, and malignant cells are all <b>agglutinated</b> by this <b>substance,</b> may contribute {{to our understanding of the}} oncogenic process. The present study compared the response to concanavalin A of rat hepatocytes derived from livers of differing developmental and mitotic-status as well as those derived from malignant liver tumors (hepatomas). Fetal hepatocytes and hepatoma cells were highly susceptible to agglutination while hepatocytes from post-natal livers, whether dividing or quiescent, were not. Treatment with protease(s) did not make the interphase hepatocyte agglutinable. These data emphasize the importance of examining a wide variety of cells in attempting to understand the interaction of lectins on cell surfaces, and further, demonstrate the value of obtaining cells directly from tissue(s) during differing physiologic and pathologic states...|$|R

Composition, properties, and {{mechanism of}} antibacterial action. J. Bacteriol. 91 : 755 – 762. 1966. —A basic proteins fraction from guinea pig polymorphonuclear (PMN) granules {{was obtained by}} acid extraction and precipitation with 20 % (v/v) ethyl alcohol. The fraction accounted {{for most of the}} antibacterial activity of the PMN granules and corresponded to the antibacterial cationic components of intact granules (bands I, II, and III) resolved by zone electrophoresis. Absence from the fraction of components identical to the enzymatic components of intact lysosomes showed that the fraction was essentially free from lysosomal enzymes. The amino acid analysis of proteins in the fraction gave a preponderance of basic amino acids (25 %), especially of arginine (16 %). The comparative amino acid analysis showed that the lysosomal cationic proteins (LCP) fraction was markedly different from nuclear histones. The LCP fraction manifested antibacterial activity against certain gram-positive and gram-positive microorganisms, including Candida albicans, and exhibited stoichiometric relationship in its activity. Microorganisms treated with LCP fraction were <b>agglutinated.</b> Anionic <b>substances</b> such as nucleic acids, heparin, and endotoxin effectively blocked the antibacterial activity of the fraction. The LCP fraction caused suppression of oxygen uptake by bacterial cells and damaged the permeability barriers of cells as manifested by rapid release of P 32 as well as ultraviolet-absorbing material at 260 mμ, in the supernatant fluid...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} stromatolites forming at {{an altitude}} of 3570 m at the shore of a volcanic lake Socompa, Argentinean Andes. The water at the site of stromatolites formation is alkaline, hypersaline, rich in inorganic nutrients, very rich in arsenic, and warm (20 - 24 °C) due to a hydrothermal input. The stromatolites do not lithify, but form broad, rounded and low-domed bioherms dominated by diatom frustules and aragonite micro-crystals <b>agglutinated</b> by extracellular <b>substances.</b> In comparison to other modern stromatolites, they harbour an atypical microbial community characterized by highly abundant representatives of Deinococcus-Thermus, Rhodobacteraceae, Desulfobacterales and Spirochaetes. Additionally, a high proportion of the sequences that could not be classified at phylum level showed less than 80 % identity to the best hit in the NCBI database, suggesting the presence of novel distant lineages. The primary production in the stromatolites is generally high and likely dominated by Microcoleus sp. Through negative phototaxis, the location of these cyanobacteria in the stromatolites is controlled by UV light, which greatly influences their photosynthetic activity. Diatoms, dominated by Amphora sp., are abundant in the anoxic, sulfidic and essentially dark parts of the stromatolites. Although their origin in the stromatolites is unclear, they are possibly an important source of anaerobically degraded organic matter that induces in situ aragonite precipitation. To the best of our knowledge, this is so far the highest altitude with documented actively forming stromatolites. Their generally rich, diverse and to a large extent novel microbial community likely harbours valuable genetic and proteomic reserves, and thus deserves active protection. Furthermore, since the stromatolites flourish in an environment characterized by a multitude of extremes, including high exposure to UV radiation, they can be an excellent model system for studying microbial adaptations under conditions that, at least in part, resemble those during the early phase of life evolution on Earth.
