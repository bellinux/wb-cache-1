The service is cheap and passengers rarely have to wait more than <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes.</b> According to some analysts, Wilmslow Road is the busiest bus corridor in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In their quarter final, they {{defeated}} Second Division Barnsley 4–1, having outplayed {{them right}} from the start, the first goal coming in the fourth minute from Beasley in an attacking move. Bowden scored the second goal, and the third came from a penalty scored by Bastin. The fourth and final Arsenal goal was Beasley's second, with Barnsley's consolation goal coming <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes</b> {{from the end of}} the match.

5|$|Porto {{were unable}} to hold onto their lead for long; two minutes after the restart, Celtic {{equalised}} when Henrik Larsson met Didier Agathe's cross to send a looping header in over Porto's goalkeeper Vítor Baía to get his tenth goal of the tournament and his 200th Celtic goal. However, within five minutes, it was 2–1 to Porto when Deco's through ball found Dmitri Alenichev, who scored with a low shot. Just three minutes later, Celtic equalised once again through Henrik Larsson when he headed in Alan Thompson's corner. After this, the game stagnated until <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes</b> {{from the end of}} the game when Jackie McNamara's errant pass found Alenichev, who shot over the crossbar.|$|E

5|$|Thick as a Brick {{was viewed}} by some critics as Jethro Tull's first {{progressive}} rock album. The album has {{a variety of}} musical themes, time signature changes and tempo shifts – all of which were features of the progressive rock scene. Although the finished album runs as one continuous piece, it is made up of a medley of individual songs that run into each other, none of which individually lasts more than <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes.</b> Parts of the suite blend classical and folk music into the typical rock music framework.|$|E
5|$|The island {{they arrived}} on {{turned out to}} be {{uninhabited}} with little food and no apparent water. After a camp had been set up ashore, White was sent back to the still floating Grasshopper to scavenge supplies. He boarded the vessel and descended below decks to search for any items that might be of use. Whilst there, he felt Judy in the darkness, pinned in her bed under a row of lockers. He constructed a raft out of materials on the Grasshopper and rowed the items, along with Judy, back to the island. The lack of water was becoming an issue, until Judy began to dig at a point on the waterline. It took <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes,</b> but Judy managed to unearth a fresh-water spring and was credited with saving everyone's lives. During the first night, the magazine on the Grasshopper finally caught light and exploded, sinking the vessel. The survivors continued to camp on the beach for the following few days, with Judy protecting them from snakes.|$|E
50|$|During the {{war years}} the {{business}} flourished, although because of this Hardman's landscape photography suffered as he had no spare time. During the Second World War there was a black market in films, but Hardman took care not to get involved. His business thrived during the war {{because of the number}} of servicemen wanting a family picture to take with them when posted abroad, or a picture of themselves to leave with their family. In 1941 the Hardmans moved to Barnston on the Wirral. There they stayed for seven years, until the Bold Street studio lease expired.

5000|$|Tail {{suspension}} test: The TST, {{also known}} as tail suspension test, shares a common theoretical basis and behavioral measure with the FST.

Typically, the suspended rodents perform immediately escape-like behaviors, followed by developing an immobile posture. If antidepressants are given prior to the test, the subjects will be engaged in escape-directed behaviors {{for longer periods of time}} than after saline treatment, exhibiting a decrease in duration of immobility.|$|R
5|$|The {{second half}} of extra time began with yet another chance for Manchester United, this time {{constructed}} from a Giggs break down the left wing, but Van Nistelrooy failed {{in his attempt to}} back-heel Giggs' cross into the goal and the opportunity was wasted. Five minutes into the second half, Reyes committed another late tackle on Silvestre, for which he received a final warning from referee Styles. Reyes himself was then the victim of a late tackle by Scholes, who was shown a yellow card. The match threatened to descend into a mass brawl soon after, when Fortune caught Ljungberg in the face with a flailing arm and then committed a high tackle on Edu, provoking a reaction from the Arsenal players. A shoulder-charge by Rooney on Cole resulted in an Arsenal free kick on the left wing; Van Persie swung the ball over and it was only cleared as far as Ljungberg, but the Swede struck a shot with his shin and the ball spun wide. With <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes</b> left in the extra period, Manchester United won a free kick on the left corner of the Arsenal penalty area when Vieira lazily tripped Ronaldo and received a booking, but Giggs' cross from the free kick was headed away. Meanwhile, Manchester United's substitute goalkeeper, Howard, was seen warming up behind the goal, suggesting that he was preparing to come on for Carroll {{in the event of a}} penalty shootout; however, no substitution was made.|$|E

25|$|Ivo Josipović gave a short speech {{after the}} exit polls were {{announced}} saying he was confident the official results would match the results they predicted. After the official results were published, he gave a victory speech shortly after midnight thanking his colleagues and especially his voters for their support and expressed conviction {{he would be the}} victor once again two weeks later. He said the citizens of Croatia have a choice between the light and the dark, with him being the light, referring to his untarnished political record, and Bandić being the dark, referring to his allegations of corruption. Milan Bandić arrived to his campaign headquarters just <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes</b> before midnight and just <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes</b> after the results were announced he gave his speech.

He claimed Croatia needs a president that works for them, not for his party. While he was speaking, most television networks were showing scenes from Josipović headquarters in the corner, with Milanović observing Bandić's remarks.

40|$|On the one hand, {{creating}} rich {{virtual worlds}} "by hand" {{like in the}} game Grand Theft Auto V is hugely expensive and limited to large studios. On the other hand, procedural content generation (PCG) allows tiny teams to create huge worlds like Hello Games did with only four people (in the beginning) for the recently released game No Man's Sky. Following {{in the footsteps of}} Hello Games, this paper tries to equip the reader with an overview about the state-of-the-art of how to build such a virtual world, i. e., a populated virtual city with buildings, streets, parks, vegetation, humans, and vehicles, using just PCG assets. Each PCG asset that is envisioned to bring the city to life is grouped and discussed in detail and the latest research trends in PCG are presented together with open questions. Using the above-mentioned PCG assets, instead of months, a city can be built in <b>a</b> mere <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes</b> by <b>a</b> user without much experience in designing 3 D assets. The city can then be used for many applications like games, virtual reality (VR), or film. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the deep ocean inertia-gravity waves, <b>a</b> high-resolution global <b>coupled</b> atmosphere–ocean simulation is carried out with <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> interval <b>of</b> 20 <b>minutes.</b> Large (~ 10 − 3 m s− 1) root-mean-square variability of vertical velocity is found in middepths (2000 – 4000 m), which is not reported in previous studies using realistic ocean simulations. Horizontal distribution of the large variability roughly corresponds to the wintertime atmospheric storm tracks and is stretched equatorward due to β-dispersion in open ocean with some “shadow regions” behind the obstacles. Frequency spectrum of vertical velocity has strong peaks at around f and 2 f (f is the local inertial period) in midlatitudes, and has additional peak at around (3 / 2) f or 3 f at some points. These results suggest necessity of re-evaluation of wind-induced near-inertial energy with high-frequency atmospheric forcing...|$|R
