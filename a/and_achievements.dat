40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the policy of}} teaching science and mathematics in English in the Malaysian educational system {{by focusing on the}} attitudes <b>and</b> <b>achievement</b> orientations of secondary school students towards the learning of these two subjects. Attitudes <b>and</b> <b>achievement</b> are two important outcomes of learning that will determine the effectiveness of an education policy. This study is based on a sample of 400 secondary school students selected from four non-premier schools. It looks into the students’ general attitudes <b>and</b> <b>achievement</b> orientations towards learning of science and mathematics as well as their variations according to four background variables, i. e., gender, ethnicity, types of feeder school <b>and</b> English <b>achievement</b> grades. It also examines the inter-correlations between the students’ attitudes <b>and</b> <b>achievement</b> orientations. Findings from statistical analyses of collected data were supplemented by more in-depth interviews. This study shows that the students’ general attitudes <b>and</b> <b>achievement</b> orientations towards learning of science and mathematics in English do not indicate that the policy has achieved its objective. However, their attitudes <b>and</b> <b>achievement</b> motivations vary according to the four background variables. The significant and positive inter-correlations between attitudes <b>and</b> <b>achievement</b> orientations towards learning of science and mathematics further confirm the causal relationship between these two important dimensions of learning...|$|R

Through meta-analysis, {{this study examines}} relationships of students’ self-efficacy, mastery goal orientation, and performance goal orientation to their achievement. Also, this study analyzes these relationships with achievement across grade levels. This study had three purposes: 1) to compare the strength of relationships among self-efficacy, goal orientation, and academic achievement; 2) {{to examine the relationship}} between self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>achievement</b> when mastery orientation is statistically removed; 3) to determine if differences exist when comparing these relationships across grade levels. Self-efficacy was most strongly related to student achievement, followed by mastery orientation and then performance orientation. The relationship between self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>achievement</b> was less strong when mastery goal orientation was statistically removed. However, this relationship between self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>achievement</b> was still higher than that between mastery orientation <b>and</b> <b>achievement.</b> Last, relationships between mastery orientation and performance orientation with achievement differ across grade levels...|$|R

Participants were 415 high school students (171 males, 244 females) from a mid-western, suburban high school that enrolls about 1, 285 students.
