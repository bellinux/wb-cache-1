50|$|During the {{breeding}} season, mammals will {{call out to}} the opposite sex. Male koalas that are bigger will let out a different sound than smaller koalas. The bigger males which are routinely sought out for are called sires. Females choose sires because of indirect benefits that their offspring could inherit, like larger bodies. Non-sires and females do not vary in their body mass and can reject a male by screaming or hitting him. Male-male competition is rarely exhibited in koalas.Acoustic signaling {{is a type of}} call that can be used from a significant distance encoding an organism’s location, condition and identity. Sac-winged bats display <b>acoustic</b> <b>signaling,</b> which is often interpreted as songs. When females hear these songs, named a ‘whistle’, they call onto the males to breed with a screech of their own. This action is termed ‘calling of the sexes’. Red deer and spotted hyenas along with other mammals also perform <b>acoustic</b> <b>signaling.</b>|$|E

Only males possess this display-worthy nasal sac, which they begin to develop around the age of four. [...] The hood begins to inflate as the seal makes its initial breath prior to going underwater. It then begins to repetitively deflate and inflate as the seal is swimming. The purpose of this {{happening}} is for <b>acoustic</b> <b>signaling,</b> meaning that it occurs when the seal feels threatened and attempts to ward off hostile species when competing for resources such as food and shelter. It also serves to communicate their health and superior status to both other males and females they are attempting to attract. In sexually mature males, a pinkish balloon-like nasal membrane comes out of the left nostril to further aid it in attracting a mate. This membrane, when shaken, is able to produce various sounds and calls depending on whether the seal is underwater or on land. Most of these acoustic signals are used in acoustic situation (about 79%), while about 12% of the signals are used for sexual purposes.|$|E

50|$|Many animals use {{multimodal}} communication, having multiple sensory modalities {{at their}} disposal for reproductive interactions, and the Astatotilapia burtoni {{has been used as}} a model to study the production of the wide variety sexual signal types. A. burtoni incorporate multiple sensory systems, including chemosensory, visual, acoustic, to be able to socially interact in their complex manner. East African cichlids in general are especially known for their vibrantly colored bodies and the role that coloration plays in courting and mating, but the A. burtoni is known to be phenotypically distinct in its use of a completely different form of sensory communication: acoustic communication. Sounds and the corresponding behaviors of the male sex of these particular African cichlids have been studied while observing the female mate preference, and behavioral experiments demonstrated that acoustic information does indeed play a significant role in sexual reproduction. This reliance on non-visual sensory information in order to coordinate complex social behaviors indicates that <b>acoustic</b> <b>signaling</b> is important for the A. burtoni. This suggests that there are internal cues in these cichlid fish that can significantly change the way in which the fish respond to auditory signals because the physiological state of the fish can directly affect the perception of the auditory signals. Thus, more efforts have been made to understand how the females perform sexual selection by closely examining the signaling systems and how they relate to the neural processing in the fish to result in such behaviors.|$|E
40|$|We provide {{evidence}} for conspecific acoustic communication in caterpillars. Larvae of the common hook-tip moth, Drepana arcuata (Drepanoidea), defend silk nest sites from conspecifics by using ritualized acoustic displays. Sounds are produced by drumming the mandibles and scraping the mandibles and specialized anal “oars” against the leaf surface. Staged interactions between a resident and intruder resulted in escalated acoustic “duels” that were typically resolved within minutes, but sometimes extended for several hours. Resident caterpillars generally won territorial disputes, {{regardless of whether they}} had built the nest, but relatively large intruders occasionally displaced residents from their nests. All evidence is consistent with <b>acoustic</b> <b>signaling</b> serving a territorial function.

40|$|The {{relation}} between <b>acoustic</b> <b>signaling</b> and reproductive success {{is important to}} understand the evolution of vocal communication systems and has been well studied in several taxa but never clearly shown in fish. This study aims to investigate whether vocal behavior affects the reproductive success in the Lusitanian toadfish (Halobatrachus didactylus) that relies on acoustic communication to attract mates. We recorded 56 nest-holding (type I) males during the breeding season and analyzed the calling performance and acoustic features of the mate advertising sounds (boatwhistles) exhibited over circa 2 weeks. Hormonal levels of the subjects and the number of eggs (reproductive success) present in the respective nests were quantified. Nesting males attracted both females and other males, namely smaller type I males with significantly lower total length (TL), body condition, sonic muscle mass, gonad mass, and accessory glands mass. Calling rate (CR), calling effort (CE) (% time spent calling), and sound dominant frequency were significantly higher in nesting males with clutches than in those without clutches. Sex steroids (11 -ketotestosterone and testosterone) were not correlated with vocal parameters or number of eggs. Maximum CR and CE were the best predictors of the number of eggs. In addition, these vocal variables were best explained by male’s TL, condition, and sonic muscle mass. We provide first evidence that vocal behavior significantly determines reproductive success in a vocal fish and show that <b>acoustic</b> <b>signaling</b> at higher and constant rates can operate as an indicator of the male’s size and body condition and probably of elevated motivation for reproduction...|$|E

Male and female ground crickets show different reactivity (i. e. the number or intensity of defense tactics used) to predation, depending on level of exposure: calling males were more reactive when approached during daylight, compared with in the dark. During daylight, calling males were more reactive than silent, cryptic, males and females.

40|$|Defense of territories in many {{animal species}} {{involves}} the advertisement of territory holder quality by <b>acoustic</b> <b>signaling.</b> In the sac-winged bat Saccopteryx bilineata, males engage in territorial countersinging when reoccupying their day-roost territories {{in the morning}} and in the evening before abandoning the roost for the night.

In territorial songs of male S. bilineata, we distinguished 6 syllable types and parameterized their acoustic properties. The analysis of 11 microsatellite loci allowed assignments of juveniles to their parents. Males had a higher reproductive success both when they uttered more territorial songs per day and when their long buzz syllables had a lower end frequency of the fundamental harmonic.

40|$|Background Fish sound {{production}} is widespread throughout many families. Territorial displays and courtship {{are the most}} common reasons for fish sound production. Yet, there is still some questions on how <b>acoustic</b> <b>signaling</b> and reproduction are correlated in many sound-producing species. In the present study, our aim was to determine if a quantitative relationship exists between calling and egg deposition in captive spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus). This type of data is essential if passive acoustics is to be used to identify spawning aggregations over large spatial scales and monitor reproductive activity over annual and decadal timeframes. Methods Acoustic recorders (i. e., DSG-Oceans) were placed in three laboratory tanks to record underwater sound over an entire, simulated reproductive season. We enumerated the number of calls, calculated the received sound pressure level, and counted the number of eggs every morning in each tank. Results Spotted seatrout produced three distinct call types characterized as “drums,” “grunts,” and “staccatos. ” Spotted seatrout calling increased as the light cycle shifted from 13. 5 to 14. 5 h of light, and the temperature increased to 27. 7  °C. Calling decreased once the temperature fell below 27. 7  °C, and the light cycle shifted to 12 h of light. These temperature and light patterns followed the natural reproductive season observed in wild spotted seatrout in the Southeast United States. Spotted seatrout exhibited daily rhythms in calling. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>signaling</b> began once the lights turned off, and calling reached maximum activity approximately 3 h later. Eggs were released only on evenings in which spotted seatrout were calling. In all tanks, spotted seatrout were more likely to spawn when male fish called more frequently. A positive relationship between SPL and the number of eggs collected was found in Tanks 1 and 3. Discussion Our findings indicate that acoustic metrics can predict spawning potential. These findings are important because plankton tows may not accurately reflect spawning locations since egg capture is likely affected by predator activity and water currents. Instead, passive acoustics could be used to monitor spotted seatrout reproduction. Future studies can use this captive study as a model to record the estuarine soundscape precisely over long time periods to better understand how human-made stressors (e. g., climate change, noise pollution, and chemical pollutants) may affect spawning patterns...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Many {{terrestrial}} {{and marine}} species have a diel ac-tivity pattern, and their <b>acoustic</b> <b>signaling</b> follows their current behavioral state. Whistles and echolocation clicks on long-term recordings produced by melon-headed whales (Peponocephala electra) at Palmyra Atoll indicated that these signals were used selectively during different {{phases of the}} day, strengthening the idea of nighttime foraging and daytime resting with afternoon socializing for this species. Spectral features of their echolocation clicks changed from day to night, shifting the median center frequency up. Additionally, click received levels increased with increasing ambient noise during both day and night. Ambient noise over a wide fre-quency band was on average higher at night. The diel adjust-ment of click features might be a reaction to acoustic masking caused by these nighttime sounds. Similar adaptations have been documented for numerous taxa in response to noise. Or it could be, unrelated, an increase in biosonar source levels and with it a shift in center frequency to enhance detection dis-tances during foraging at night. Call modifications in intensity, directionality, frequency, and duration according to echolocation task are well established for bats. This finding indicates that melon-headed whales have flexibility in their acoustic behavior, and they collectively and repeatedly adapt their signals from day- to nighttime circumstances...|$|E

Among acoustic insects, cicada males are particularly known for their loud and diverse sounds which function importantly in communication. The main method of sound production in cicadas is the tymbal mechanism, and a relative small number of cicada species possess both tymbal and stridulatory organs. However, cicadas of the genus Karenia {{do not have any}} specialized sound-producing structures, so they are referred to as "mute". This denomination is quite misleading, as they indeed produce sounds. Here, we investigate the sound-producing mechanism and acoustic communication of the "mute" cicada, Karenia caelatata, and discover a new sound-production mechanism for cicadas: i. e., K. caelatata produces impact sounds by banging the forewing costa against the operculum. The temporal, frequency and amplitude characteristics of the impact sounds are described. Morphological studies and reflectance-based analyses reveal that the structures involved in sound production of K. caelatata (i. e., forewing, operculum, cruciform elevation, and wing-holding groove on scutellum) are all morphologically modified. Acoustic playback experiments and behavioral observations suggest that the impact sounds of K. caelatata are used in intraspecific communication and function as calling songs. The new sound-production mechanism expands our knowledge on the diversity of <b>acoustic</b> <b>signaling</b> behavior in cicadas and further underscores the need for more bioacoustic studies on cicadas which lack tymbal mechanism...|$|E

Little {{is known about}} hormonal and neuromuscular adaptations underlying complex courtship displays in tropical birds. Building upon work from the 1930 s/ 40 s by Frank Chapman and Percy Lowe, we have been investigating the physiology of courtship behavior in Golden-collared Manakins (Manacus vitellinus) of Panama. Male manakins display daily on arenas within forest leks for 6 or more months. Using high-speed video, we have analyzed several courtship behaviors including multiple complex dance moves {{and the production of}} snapping sounds produced by rapid lifting of their wings. Blood levels of testosterone (T) in males are generally elevated during this reproductive period, are basal {{for the remainder of the}} year, and are low in females year round. These data suggest that T activates male manakin courtship. Consistent with this hypothesis, T-treatment of non-reproductive birds-activates several courtship behaviors. T likely stimulates courtship by actions on androgen receptors (AR). AR are expressed widely in the manakin brain and spinal cord and treatments with the AR-blocker flutamide disturb normal courtship behavior. Although T activates courtship, there is little correspondence between an individuals' circulating T level and the frequency or intensity of courtship activity.

Recordings were collected during the early part of the breeding season during two consecutive years (2008 - 2009). Analyses focused on understanding how the vocal output of Common Loons varied with time of day, time of year, and in response to variation in weather. Common Loons showed significant diel variation in vocal output, producing more wail, yodel, and tremolo calls at night than during the day. Common Loons showed significant seasonal variation in vocal output, producing fewer wail, yodel, and tremolo calls as the first month of the breeding season progressed. Common Loons showed significant differences in vocal behavior with changing weather conditions, producing more calls at cold temperatures, with low wind speed and air pressure, and when rain was light or absent. Microphone array recordings were used to estimate signal transmission properties of Common Loon vocalizations, demonstrating that wail, yodel, and tremolo calls transmit significantly farther at night than during the day.
