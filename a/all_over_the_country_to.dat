25|$|The Tenth Street Studio Building was {{situated}} at 51 West 10th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, {{the building was}} commissioned by James Boorman Johnston and designed by Richard Morris Hunt. Its innovative design soon represented a national architectural prototype, and featured a domed central gallery, from which interconnected rooms radiated. Hunt's studio within the building housed the first architectural school in the United States. Soon after its completion in 1857, the building helped to make Greenwich Village central to the arts in New York City, drawing artists from <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> work, exhibit, and sell their art.

25|$|At long last, on October 28, {{a killing}} frost struck. The city sent out word to Memphians {{scattered}} <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> come home. Though yellow fever cases {{were recorded in}} the pages of Elmwood Cemetery's burial record as late as February 29, the epidemic seemed quieted. The Board of Health declared the epidemic, which caused over 20,000 deaths and financial losses of nearly $200 million, at an end. On November 27, a general citizen's meeting was called at the Greenlaw Opera House to offer thanks to those who had stayed behind to serve and die. Over the next year property tax revenues collapsed, and the city could not make payments on its municipal debts. As a result of this crisis, Memphis temporarily lost its city charter and was reclassified by the state legislature as a Taxing District from 1878–1893. Although Memphis lost its charter and 75% of its population, a new era of sanitation was developed in Memphis. A new municipal government in 1879 helped form the first regional health organization and during the 1880s led the nation in sanitary reform and improvements.|$|E
25|$|When Gandhi was in prison, Patel {{was asked}} by Members of Congress to lead the satyagraha in Nagpur in 1923 against a law banning the raising of the Indian flag. He {{organised}} thousands of volunteers from <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> take part in processions of people hoisting the flag. Patel negotiated a settlement obtaining the release of all prisoners and allowing nationalists to hoist the flag in public. Later that year, Patel and his allies uncovered evidence suggesting {{that the police were}} in league with local dacoits in the Borsad taluka even as the government prepared to levy a major tax for fighting dacoits in the area. More than 6,000 villagers assembled to hear Patel speak in support of proposed agitation against the tax, which was deemed immoral and unnecessary. He organised hundreds of Congressmen, sent instructions, and received information from across the district. Every village in the taluka resisted payment of the tax, and through cohesion, also prevented the seizure of property and land. After a protracted struggle, the government withdrew the tax. Historians believe that one of Patel's key achievements was the building of cohesion and trust amongst the different castes and communities, which had been divided along socio-economic lines.|$|E
