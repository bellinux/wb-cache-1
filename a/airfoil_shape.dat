25|$|The prototype, {{named the}} Stipa-Caproni, first flew on October 7, 1932. Remarkably ungainly in appearance, the plane {{nonetheless}} proved Stipa's concept in that its intubed propeller increased its engine's efficiency, and the <b>airfoil</b> <b>shape</b> {{of the tube}} gave it an improved rate of climb compared to conventional aircraft of similar engine power and wing loading. The Stipa-Caproni also had a very low landing speed and was much quieter than conventional aircraft. Its rudder and elevators were mounted in the propeller's slipstream in the opening at {{the trailing edge of}} the tube in order to improve handling, and this configuration gave the aircraft handling characteristics that it made it very stable in flight.|$|E
25|$|Another hunting weapon, {{based on}} {{different}} principles than the spear, is the throwing stick. While at its simplest the throwing stick {{is just a}} heavy club thrown at the game, a well designed throwing stick uses the principles of an <b>airfoil</b> <b>shape</b> and gyroscopic stability; the oldest of these dates back 200,000 years to ancient Poland. The kylie, for example, an Australian hunting boomerang in use into modern times, uses the bent shape and a symmetric airfoil cross section to provide stability and low drag for long, accurate throws. Kylies do not return (a good thing, since they are large, heavy, and dangerous) but smaller, lighter versions, the classic boomerang, exhibit the classic circular path that made the boomerang famous. Boomerangs, of both the non-returning and returning variety, {{have been found in}} many ancient cultures, ranging from Egypt to North America.|$|E

25|$|The EC225 {{is based}} on the Eurocopter AS332L2 Super Puma, {{improving}} upon the design with a five-blade main rotor incorporating a new <b>airfoil</b> <b>shape</b> to reduce vibration and noise levels. The blades of the rotors feature a composite spar and parabolic blade tips; they can also be equipped with an anti-icing system to enable the aircraft to operate within very cold climates. The helicopter is powered by two Turbomeca Makila 2A1 turboshaft engines mounted over the cabin; these engines are capable of providing 14 per cent more engine power and feature a redundant dual-channel full authority digital engine control (FADEC) system for high reliability, a further backup system is present in the event of both FADEC systems failing. The FADEC system ensures that engine power is always kept within the limits of the gearbox. Many of the mechanical components, particularly of the engines, were designed to be modular to ease maintenance, and composite materials were used where possible to reduce the aircraft's weight.|$|E

500|$|Wing types defined herewith: elliptical; high speed; high aspect ratio; soaring. The bird's forelimbs {{that are}} the key to flight. Each wing has a central axis, {{composed}} of three limb bones, the humerus, ulna and radius. The hand, or manus, which ancestrally was composed of five digits, is reduced to three digits (digit II, III and IV or I, II, III depending on the scheme followed), which serves as an anchor for the , one of two groups of flight feathers responsible for the wing's <b>airfoil</b> <b>shape.</b> The other set of flight feathers, behind the carpal joint on the ulna, are called the [...] The remaining feathers on the wing are known as , of which there are three sets. The wing sometimes has vestigial claws. In most species these are lost by the time the bird is adult (such as the highly visible ones used for active climbing by hoatzin chicks), but claws are retained into adulthood by the secretarybird, screamers, finfoots, ostriches, several swifts and numerous others, as a local trait, in a few specimens. Most kinds of bird wings can be grouped into four types, with some falling between two of these types: i) elliptical wings—short and rounded, having a low aspect ratio, allowing for tight maneuvering in confined spaces such as might be found in dense vegetation, which are common in forest raptors and many migratory species of passerines, and species that use a rapid take off to evade predators, such as pheasants and partridges; ii) high speed wings—short, pointed wings that when combined with a heavy wing loading and rapid wingbeats provide an energetically expensive high speed, used by the bird with the fastest wing speed, the peregrine falcon, as well as by most of the ducks and the auks who uses the shape for a different purpose, to [...] "fly" [...] underwater; iii) high aspect ratio wings—typified by low wing loading and which are far longer than they are wide, they are used for slower flight which may take the form of almost hovering (as used by kestrels, terns and nightjars) or in soaring and gliding flight, particularly the dynamic soaring used by seabirds, which takes advantage of wind speed variation at different altitudes (wind shear) above ocean waves to provide lift; and iv) soaring wings with deep slots—common in larger species of inland birds, such as eagles, vultures, pelicans, and storks, the slots {{at the end of the}} wings, between the primaries, reduce the induced drag and wingtip vortices, whilst the shorter size of the wings aids in takeoff (high aspect ratio wings require a long taxi to get airborne).|$|E

Changes included {{reducing the number of}} full wing ribs and cutting lightening holes in the main spar. The aircraft's engineers told the NTSB that the changes made to the design resulted in a wing that was soft and flexible, allowing its shape to become distorted and possibly causing unpredictable behavior in stalls and spins. The design engineers said that the GAW-1 airfoil required a rigid structure because it was especially sensitive to <b>airfoil</b> <b>shape,</b> and that use of a flexible surface with that airfoil would make the Tomahawk wing [...] "a new and unknown commodity in stalls and spins." ...|$|E

40|$|Morphing technology, {{inspired}} by bat and bird flight can enable an aircraft to adapt its shape to enhance mission performance and optimize flight attitude controlling efficiency. A morphing airfoil concept is proposed {{to replace the}} traditional flap, ailerons, elevator and rudders {{in order to improve}} aerodynamic efficiency in this paper. A procedure is used to virtually simulate a morphing wing to perform fast, relatively accurately and efficiently. A set of optimal <b>airfoil</b> <b>shapes</b> obtained are aimed at minimizing the aerodynamic drag character by optimizing morphing configurations at different Cl under the two-dimensional steady-flow simulation. These <b>airfoil</b> <b>shapes</b> are used to maneuver flight attitude, minimize drag and take place of traditional control surfaces of different rolling, yawing and pitching moment. Then, the basic relationships between optimized morphing airfoil and the traditional control element on rolling, pitching and yawing moment are simplified to the relationship of Cl.

40|$|<b>Airfoil</b> <b>shapes</b> {{tailored}} to specific inflow conditions and loading requirements {{can offer a}} significant performance potential over classic <b>airfoil</b> <b>shapes.</b> However, their optimal operating range has to be matched thoroughly to the overall compressor layout. This paper describes methods to organize a large set of optimized airfoils in a database and its application in the throughflow design. Optimized airfoils are structured in five dimensions: inlet Mach number, blade stagger angle, pitch–chord ratio, maximum thickness–chord ratio, and a parameter for aerodynamic loading. In this space, {{a high number of}} airfoil geometries are generated by means of numerical optimization. During the optimization of each airfoil, the performance at design and off-design conditions is evaluated with the blade-to-blade flow solver MISES. Together with the airfoil geometry, the database stores automatically calibrated correlations which describe the cascade performance in throughflow calculation. Based on these methods, two subsonic stages of a 4. 5 -stage transonic research compressor are redesigned. Performance of the baseline and updated geometry is evaluated with 3 D CFD. The overall approach offers accurate throughflow design incorporating optimized <b>airfoil</b> <b>shapes</b> and a fast transition from throughflow to 3 D CFD design...|$|R
2500|$|The Gulfstream II is a twin-jet {{swept wing}} {{corporate}} transport powered by two Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engines {{and designed to}} provide high speed and long range capability without sacrificing the airport performance, reliability, and other operational advantages of its predecessor, the turboprop Gulfstream I. Preliminary design of the wing was influenced by both cruise and low speed considerations. The aft-mounted engine location was selected after extensive analysis and design iterations considering aerodynamic, structural, and ground clearance requirements. Airfoil geometry was developed to maximum sweep benefit from the selected planform. [...] The interference problem at the wing-body juncture was treated by modification of the <b>airfoil</b> <b>shape</b> and thickness over the inner third of the wing span. The basic airfoils for the main area of the wing {{are similar to those}} of the Grumman A-6 Intruder aircraft and utilize NACA 6-series thickness distributions combined with an in-house mean line. A buffet boundary commensurate with the M=.85 speed capability was attained by incorporating a row of co-rotating vortex generators on the outer wing panel. In developing the wing contours, attention was paid to the aircraft's low speed requirements by tailoring the leading edge radius to preclude leading edge separation. The high lift configuration, consists of a one piece, single-slotted Fowler flap of 30% chord. [...] Stall initiation on the basic wing was found to occur at midspan but spread rapidly to the tip, particularly at large flap deflections. The addition of an upper surface fence at about midspan provided a strong pitch down at the stall, without sacrificing maximum lift, and also afforded an adequate margin between initial and tip stall.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tail section}} of the {{aircraft}} was redesigned as well. The rudder was slightly reduced in area and the symmetrical fin section changed to an <b>airfoil</b> <b>shape,</b> producing a sideways lift force that swung the tail slightly to the left. This helped increase {{the effectiveness of the}} rudder, and reduced the need for application of right rudder on takeoff to counteract torque effects from the engine and propeller. The conspicuous bracing struts were removed from the horizontal tailplanes which were relocated to slightly below and forward of their original positions. A semi-retractable tailwheel was fitted and the main undercarriage legs were raked forward by six degrees to improve the ground handling. An unexpected structural flaw of the wing and tail section was revealed when the first F-1s were rushed into service; some aircraft crashed or nearly crashed, with either the wing surface wrinkling or fracturing, or by the tail structure failing. In one such accident, the commander of JG 2 [...] "Richthofen", Wilhelm Balthasar, lost his life when he was attacked by a Spitfire during a test flight. While making an evasive manoeuvre, the wings broke away and Balthasar was killed when his aircraft hit the ground. Slightly thicker wing skins and reinforced spars dealt with the wing problems. Tests were also carried out to find out why the tails had failed, and it was found that at certain engine settings a high-frequency oscillation in the tailplane spar was overlapped by harmonic vibrations from the engine; the combined effect being enough to cause structural failure at the rear fuselage/fin attachment point. Initially, two external stiffening plates were screwed onto the outer fuselage on each side, and later the entire structure was reinforced.|$|E

5000|$|The {{use of the}} TP {{conductor}} {{reduces the}} propensity of ice/wind galloping starting on the line. In an ice storm when ice deposits start to accumulate along the conductor the twisted conductor profile prevents a uniform <b>airfoil</b> <b>shape</b> from forming.

The TP conductor profile and this absence of the uniform <b>airfoil</b> <b>shape</b> inhibits the initiation of the galloping motion. The reduction in motion during icing events helps prevent the phase conductors from contacting each other causing a fault and an associated outage of the electrical circuit. With the reduction in large amplitude motions, closer phase spacing or longer span lengths can be used. This in turn {{can result in a}} lower cost of construction. TP conductor is generally only installed in areas that normally are exposed to wind speed and freezing temperature conditions associated with ice buildup.|$|E
