40|$|Abstracl [...] Diglyphus isueu Walker is a larval ectoparasitoid used in {{biological}} pest control againsl the <b>American</b> <b>serpentine</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> Lirio yza trifolii Burgess. We studied the parasitoid's host searching behavior, using olfacto-metric methods. Our {{data show that}} the parasitoids locate host larvae (a leaf-mining dipteran) {{on the basis of}} volatile signals released by the plant-host complex. Female D, isaea are strongly attracted to the dorsarising from damaged bean plants, whereas they show practically no response to intact plants, The results of our chemical analyses showed that about 15 components were present, two of which, cis- 3 -hexen-I-ol and 4 -hydroxy- 4 -methyl- 2 -pen-tunone, were present in significantly larger quantities in the leaf extracts from mined or damaged bean plants than in those from healthy plants. The damage inflicted by the host larvae on these plants triggers the release of larg r amounts of these substances, which probably le d the parasites to their hosts. The compounds thus act as synomones. Key Words [...] Parasites, volatile signals, ynomone, host detection, Hyme-noptem, Eulophidae, Diglyphus isaea...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, the <b>serpentine</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> Liriomyza trifolii (Burgess), {{has become}} a major pest of cotton (Gossypium spp.) in India, with high levels of {{incidence}} observed at the seedling stage, particularly in transgenic Bt cotton. We monitored the severity of infestation and damage by L. trifolii to transgenic and non-transgenic genotypes of Gossypium arboreum and G. hirsutum between 2002 and 2007. Overall, significantly lower L. trifolii damage occurred in G. arboreum varieties than in G. hirsutum varieties and hybrids. Among the G. hirsutum genotypes, damage was significantly lower in varieties than in hybrids. However, no significant differences in damage were observed between Bt and non-Bt cotton hybrids. Abiotic factors had a major influence on the severity of damage; there was a significant and negative association of L. trifolii damage with open pan evaporation (E), maximum temperature, solar radiation and sunshine, and a significant and positive association with relative humidity and rainfall (RF). Multiple stepwise regression analysis indicated that 99 % of the variation in L. trifolii damage was accounted for by RF, open pan E and relative humidity...|$|R
40|$|Various {{species of}} <b>serpentine</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> are serious pests of {{vegetable}} crops, especially on cucumber and tomato, in greenhouse and open fields. Reduction of chemical insecticides’ use {{in order to}} minimize pesticide residues on these crops {{is one of the most}} important aspects of food safety. Yellow sticky cards have been used successfully for many pests and can be used for <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> too. Therefore, this investigation was performed to find out how to use these cards, including their height and spacing. To find the most proper height in the first step, three different heights (50, 120 and 170 cm from ground level) were considered, based on randomized complete blocks design with five replications, at the beginning of the growing season (plants with 5 - 6 leaves and less than 50 cm height). Results showed that traps on 50 cm height captured most of the insects, were in the same statistical group with 120 cm high traps, and had significant difference with 170 cm high treatment. In the second step, at which the experiment was replicated in the peak of adult population, when the plants were in their full height (160 cm), the 170 cm high traps adsorbed most of the adult <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> in three days. To find out the best trap spacing, the 170 cm high traps were placed at three different spacing of 1, 2 and 3 m and were compared to control (no trap).

40|$|<b>Serpentine</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> {{is one of}} {{the serious}} pests of {{vegetable}} crops in greenhouse and open fields, especially on cucumber and tomato. Reduction of synthetic insecticides’ use in order to minimize pesticide residues on these crops is an important basis of food safety. Application of bio-insecticides, especially neem products’ oil, is a very important alternative. Investigation on the efficacy of the commercial neem extract formulation with different concentrations was experimented on cucumber under greenhouse conditions. In the first year, experiments were performed in a completely randomized blocks design with six treatments and three replications. Five treatments included various concentrations of NeemAzal-T/S including 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, 1 and 1. 5 ml/m 2 and the sixth one was control without any chemicals. The results showed that on the third and seventh day of the treatment with concentrations of 0. 75, 1 and 1. 5 ml/m 2, more than 80 % mortality was observed, which shows a significant difference with 0. 25 and 0. 5 ml/m 2 treatments. In the second year, the efficiency of two concentrations (1 and 1. 5 ml/m 2) of NeemAzal-T/S was evaluated in comparison with chlorpyrifos, abamectin and permethrin. Results revealed that efficiency of the two neem concentrations had no significant difference compared with chlorpirophos and abamectin. Therefore, it could be concluded that NeemAzal-T/S could be successfully recommended to replace the chemical insecticides...|$|R

In general, {{there were no significant differences}} in oviposition between the transgenic and the non-transgenic cultivars under protected and unprotected conditions. The larval numbers were significantly lower on the transgenic hybrids during the 2004 rainy season under high infestation, but the differences in larval density between the transgenic and non-transgenic hybrids during 2002 and 2003 seasons under low levels of infestation were quite small. Bollworm damage in squares and bolls was significantly lower in the transgenic hybrids than in the non-transgenic ones, although there were a few exceptions. Differences in seed cotton yield between the transgenic and the non-transgenic hybrids were not significant under unprotected conditions at moderate levels of infestation during the 2002 and 2003 cropping seasons (except in the case of Mech 184). However, significant differences in seed cotton yield were observed during the 2004 cropping season under heavy bollworm infestation. Seed cotton yield of the first picking in transgenic hybrids was significantly greater than that of the non-transgenic counterparts. Transgenic hybrids suffered low shoot damage by spotted bollworm, Earias vittella. However, there were no differences between the transgenic and non-transgenic hybrids in their relative susceptibility to cotton jassid, Amrasca biguttula biguttula and <b>serpentine</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> Liriomyza trifolii, white fly, Bemisia tabaci, green bug, Nezara viridula, ash weevil, Myllocerus undecimpustulatus, and red cotton bug, Dysdercus koenigii.

The results suggested that it would be useful to combine transgenic resistance to H. armigera with plant characteristics conferring resistance to the target or non-target insect pests in the region in order to realize the full potential of transgenic plants for sustainable crop production...|$|R

The song {{is based on}} Graham Lewis's fascination with the <b>Serpentine</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> insect and details {{the life cycle of}} the insect. EMI recognised that the song could potentially be a hit single, but were concerned that it was too short, measuring only 1 minute 45 seconds. Unusually the label asked the band to make a longer version for the single. The band added an additional verse and chorus, and a piano solo played by producer Mike Thorne, pushing the length to 2 minutes 51 seconds. EMI were confident that the song could become a hit and commercial breakthrough for the band. The single soon entered the charts reaching number 51 and the BBC approached EMI and asked them to appear on the long running music show Top of the Pops if the single continued to rise. At the time Top of the Pops {{was one of the few}} opportunities for acts to promote their work on national television, with over 15 million viewers. However the British Market Research Bureau who compiled the UK Singles Chart claimed that there was an attempt to rig the chart by EMI personnel buying multiple copies of the single in chart return shops. Although EMI strenuously denied any attempts at rigging the chart, that weeks sales were not included. Despite selling twice as many copies as the previous week, [...] these sales weren't included and subsequently the single dropped down the chart [...] and Wire's chance to appear on Top of The Pops disappeared along with their chance to reach a wider audience.

Parasitic wasps control the coffee <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> but few studies have examined the role of predators, such as ants, that are abundant and diverse in coffee plantations. Here, we examine linkages between arboreal ant communities and coffee <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> incidence in a coffee plantation in Mexico. We examined relationships between incidence and severity of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> attack and: (1) variation in canopy cover, tree density, tree diversity, and relative abundance of Inga spp. shade trees; (2) presence of Azteca instabilis, an arboreal canopy dominant ant; and (3) the number of arboreal twig-nesting ant species and nests in coffee plants. Differences in vegetation characteristics in study plots did not correlate with <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> damage perhaps because environmental factors act on pest populations at a larger spatial scale. Further, presence of A. instabilis did not influence presence or severity of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> damage. The proportion of leaves with <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> damage was significantly lower where abundance of twig-nesting ants was higher but not where twig-nesting ant richness was higher.
