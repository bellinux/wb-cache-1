5|$|A race riot {{broke out}} in May 1943 of whites against blacks. ADDSCO {{management}} had long maintained segregated conditions at the shipyards, although the Roosevelt administration had ordered defense contractors to integrate facilities. That year ADDSCO promoted 12 blacks to positions as welders, previously reserved for whites; <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> objected to the change by rioting on May 24. The mayor appealed to the governor to call in the National Guard to restore order, but it was weeks before officials allowed African Americans to return to work, keeping them away for their safety.|$|E
5|$|After the 1848 {{finding of}} gold in the Sierra Nevada and {{dramatic}} gains in new wealth from it, other men {{became interested in the}} potential for gold mining in the Black Hills. In 1874, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer led a military expedition from Fort Abraham Lincoln near Bismarck, to explore the Black Hills for gold and to determine a suitable location for a military fort in the Hills. Custer's announcement {{of gold in}} the Black Hills triggered the Black Hills Gold Rush. Tensions increased between the Lakota <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> seeking to move into the Black Hills.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{generally}} {{give credit}} to Colonel Noel Parrish, Commander of Tuskegee Field from 1942 to 1946, for his enlightened leadership and fair treatment of cadets which improved morale by {{reducing the amount of}} segregation and overcrowding and improving relations with both blacks <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> in the town of Tuskegee. The record of the Airmen became a driving force for President Harry S Truman's decision to desegregate the U.S. military in 1948.|$|E

He made 120 {{appearances}} for Atlético Madrid over the course of a four-year span, scoring six goals and earning three winners' medals. Domínguez later revealed that the club's lack of trust in academy players had contributed to his decision to sign for Gladbach.|$|E
5|$|John Baldwin was {{a person}} whose views seemed {{to run counter to}} the {{conventional}} customs of the time. Despite his accomplishments, he never wrote a book, held public office, or even kept books. Although he was not an abolitionist by definition, he had no problem teaching blacks <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> as equals, as evident by his opening Baldwin Institute without regard to race or gender. His parents taught him to fear God, and he consequently devoted himself to living humbly and righteously, to being kind to the poor, and to joining the Methodist Church.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles have lighter greys {{and browns}} amidst the starker blacks <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> of their plumage; two- or three-year-old birds {{of both sexes}} closely {{resemble}} and are difficult to distinguish from adult females. Immature birds have dark brownish eyes until around two years of age. Australian magpies generally live to around 25 years of age, though ages of up to 30 years have been recorded. The reported age of first breeding has varied according to area, but the average is {{between the ages of}} three and five years.|$|E
50|$|After year 1975, black <b>and</b> <b>white</b> {{films were}} decrease. Avargal (1977) {{was among the}} black <b>and</b> <b>white</b> Tamil films that was a {{successful}} film. Tamil Cinema rarely produced black <b>and</b> <b>white</b> films in the 1980s. Sandhya Ragam (1989) was Tamil Cinema's last full length black <b>and</b> <b>white</b> Tamil film. Although in black <b>and</b> <b>white,</b> this film won the 37th National Film Awards and it won the Award for Best Film on Family Welfare (1990). Iruvar (1997) had some sequence in black <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> {{it was meant to}} be in black <b>and</b> <b>white.</b> Mugham (year 1999) had some black <b>and</b> <b>white</b> sequence <b>and</b> turned up to be a box office failure.|$|R
50|$|The {{official}} club colours of red, black, <b>and</b> <b>white</b> {{have their}} {{origins in the}} colours of the founding clubs Frankfurter FC Viktoria and Frankfurter FC Kickers, which sported red <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> black <b>and</b> <b>white</b> respectively. Red <b>and</b> <b>white</b> are the colours of the city coat of arms, <b>and</b> black <b>and</b> <b>white</b> the colours of Prussia. When the clubs merged, officials decided to adopt the colours of both sides. Since local rival Kickers Offenbach sport the colours red <b>and</b> <b>white,</b> Eintracht avoids playing in such a kit, preferring to play in black and red, or in black <b>and</b> <b>white.</b>|$|R

5|$|King {{stated that}} black Americans, {{as well as}} other {{disadvantaged}} Americans, should be compensated for historical wrongs. In an interview conducted for Playboy in 1965, he said that granting black Americans only equality could not realistically close the economic gap between them <b>and</b> <b>whites.</b> King said that he did not seek a full restitution of wages lost to slavery, which he believed impossible, but proposed a government compensatory program of $50billion over ten years to all disadvantaged groups.|$|E

5|$|The Reds {{carried out}} an {{unsuccessful}} general offensive in February 1918, supplied with weapons by Soviet Russia. A counteroffensive by the Whites began in March, reinforced by an Imperial German Army squad in April. The decisive combats were the Battle of Tampere and Viipuri, {{won by the}} Whites, and the Battles of Helsinki and Lahti, won by German troops, leading to overall victory of the Whites and the German forces. Both the Reds <b>and</b> <b>Whites</b> engaged in political terror. A high number of Red POWs died due to malnutrition and disease. Altogether, around 39,000 people – 36,000 Finns – perished in the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his career, Wilson {{was known}} for championing causes that were at times unpopular, {{including}} {{the abolition of slavery}} and workers' rights for both blacks <b>and</b> <b>whites.</b> Massachusetts politician George F. Hoar, who served in the United States House of Representatives while Wilson was a Senator, and later served in the Senate himself, believed Wilson to be the most skilled political organizer in the country. However, Wilson's reputation for personal integrity and principled politics was somewhat damaged late in his Senate career by his involvement in the Crédit Mobilier scandal.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, Sitting Bull {{was allowed}} to leave the {{reservation}} to go Wild Westing with Buffalo Bill Cody’s Buffalo Bill's Wild West. He earned about $50 a week for riding once around the arena, {{where he was a}} popular attraction. Although it is rumored that he cursed his audiences in his native tongue during the show, the historian Utley contends that he did not. Historians have reported that Sitting Bull gave speeches about his desire for education for the young, and reconciling relations between the Sioux <b>and</b> <b>whites.</b> The historian Edward Lazarus wrote that Sitting Bull reportedly cursed his audience in Lakota in 1884, during an opening address celebrating the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway.|$|E

5|$|Interior Secretary Carl Schurz {{carried out}} Hayes's American Indian policy, {{beginning}} with preventing the War Department from {{taking over the}} Bureau of Indian Affairs. Hayes and Schurz carried out a policy that included assimilation into white culture, educational training, and dividing Indian land into individual household allotments. Hayes believed that his policies would lead to self-sufficiency and peace between Indians <b>and</b> <b>whites.</b> The allotment system was favored by liberal reformers at the time, including Schurz, but instead proved detrimental to American Indians. They lost much of their land through later sales to unscrupulous white speculators. Hayes and Schurz reformed the Bureau of Indian Affairs to reduce fraud and gave Indians responsibility for policing their understaffed reservations.|$|E
5|$|Several journalists {{hypothesized}} that the Johnson–Bird rivalry was so appealing because it represented many other contrasts, such as the clash between the Lakers and Celtics, between Hollywood flashiness ("Showtime") and Boston/Indiana blue collar grit ("Celtic Pride"), and between blacks <b>and</b> <b>whites.</b> The rivalry was also significant because it drew national attention to the faltering NBA. Prior to Johnson and Bird's arrival, the NBA had gone through a decade of declining interest and low TV ratings. With the two future Hall of Famers, the league won {{a whole generation of}} new fans, drawing both traditionalist adherents of Bird's dirt court Indiana game and those appreciative of Johnson's public park flair. According to sports journalist Larry Schwartz of ESPN, Johnson and Bird saved the NBA from bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|By 77 BC, {{the rivalry}} between the Red and the Whites was already developed, when a funeral for a Red driver {{involved}} a Red supporter throwing {{himself on the}} funeral pyre. No writer of the time, however, refers to these as factions such as came into existence later, with the factions being official organizations. Writing {{near the beginning of}} the third century, he wrote that the Reds were dedicated to Mars, the Whites to the Zephyrs, the Greens to Mother Earth or spring, and the Blues to the sky and sea or autumn. Domitian created two new factions, the Purples and Golds, which disappeared soon after he died. The Blues and the Greens gradually became the most prestigious factions, supported by emperor and populace alike. Numerous occasions occurred when a Blue vs. Green clash would break out during a race. Indeed, Reds <b>and</b> <b>Whites</b> are only rarely mentioned in the surviving literature, although their continued activity is documented in inscriptions and in curse-tablets.|$|E

5|$|The Simpson County sheriff moved Dinning to Bowling Green and {{eventually}} to Louisville {{to prevent him from}} being lynched. Governor Bradley dispatched a squad of the state militia to protect him while his trial proceeded. Despite the fact that the case involved a black man killing a white man, most observers believed Dinning would be acquitted on grounds of self-defense. The jury, however, convicted Dinning of manslaughter and sentenced him to seven years of hard labor. Immediately, Bradley's office was flooded with requests for him to intervene on Dinning's behalf. The requests came from blacks <b>and</b> <b>whites,</b> some of them ex-Confederates. Dinning's attorney, Augustus E. Willson, formally requested a pardon, and Bradley issued it 10days after the conviction. Bradley opined that Dinning had acted reasonably under the circumstances and that it was a shame that no members of the mob were charged. After being freed, Dinning relocated to Indiana and hired ex-Confederate Bennett H. Young to file a federal lawsuit against some members of the mob that had identified themselves during his trial. The trial was held in Louisville, and Dinning was awarded $50,000 in damages.|$|E
5|$|The novel then {{switches}} {{to the second}} plot strand, the story of Lucas Burch/Joe Brown's partner Joe Christmas. The surly, psychopathic Christmas {{has been on the}} run for years, ever since presumably killing his strict Methodist adopted father. Although he has light skin, Christmas suspects that he is of African American ancestry. Consumed with rage, he is a bitter outcast who wanders between black and white society, constantly provoking fights with blacks <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> alike. Christmas comes to Jefferson three years prior to the central events of the novel and gets a job at the mill where Byron, and later Joe Brown, works. The job at the mill is a cover for Christmas's bootlegging operation, which is illegal under Prohibition. He has a sexual relationship with Joanna Burden, an older woman who descended from a formerly powerful abolitionist family whom the town despises as carpetbaggers. Though their relationship is passionate at first, Joanna begins menopause and turns to religion, which frustrates and angers Christmas. At the end of her relationship with Christmas, Joanna tries to force him, at gunpoint, to kneel and pray. Joanna is murdered soon after: her throat is slit and she is nearly decapitated.|$|E
5|$|When World War II started, tonnage {{levels at}} the port {{decreased}} and shipping activities were suspended; however, the war did provide economic benefits for the city. Petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber products by the defense industry during the war. Ellington Field, initially built during World War I, was revitalized as an advanced training center for bombardiers and navigators. The Brown Shipbuilding Company was founded in 1942 to build ships for the U.S. Navy during World War II. Due to the boom in defense jobs, thousands of new workers migrated to the city, both blacks <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> competing for the higher-paying jobs. President Roosevelt had established a policy of nondiscrimination for defense contractors, and blacks gained some opportunities, especially in shipbuilding, although not without resistance from whites and increasing social tensions that erupted into occasional violence. Economic gains of blacks who entered defense industries continued in the postwar years.|$|E

Various combinations were used until, {{the outbreak of}} World War I, these included green shirts <b>and</b> <b>white</b> shorts, green <b>and</b> <b>white</b> stripes <b>and</b> green <b>and</b> <b>white</b> halves. In 1919 the colours changed again, with their new dark green shirts earning Chester the nickname the Ivies. 1920 saw another change of colours, this time to black <b>and</b> <b>white,</b> which earned Chester the nickname Magpies. Black <b>and</b> <b>White</b> remained the colours until 1930, when they were changed to blue <b>and</b> <b>white</b> stripes.
