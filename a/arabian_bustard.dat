50|$|The {{following}} subspecies of <b>Arabian</b> <b>bustard</b> {{are currently}} recognised.|$|E
50|$|NARC in Yemen {{provides}} presentations on the <b>Arabian</b> <b>bustard</b> {{to school}} children.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Arabian</b> <b>bustard</b> {{is usually}} solitary or lives in pairs and family parties. Small flocks have been {{observed}} migrating north into the Sahel zone, to breed {{during the rainy season}} before returning south when the dry season begins. However the population in Morocco was considered sedentary, as is the population in the Arabian Peninsula. On these movements the <b>Arabian</b> <b>bustard</b> has been known to migrate with Denham's bustards.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Arabian</b> <b>bustards</b> are {{reported}} to catch and eat locusts, grasshoppers, beetles, reptiles and small mammals. They have alsoe been recorded feeding on the seeds and fruits of shrubs, such as Cordia sinensis, Grewia villosa, Salvadora persica and wild melon Citrullus as well as [...] "Acacia" [...] gum. In Chobe National Park (Botswana), <b>Arabian</b> <b>bustards</b> are sometimes found with southern carmine bee-eaters (Merops nubicoides) and northern carmine bee-eaters (Merops nubicus) riding on their backs.|$|R
50|$|In Arabia, {{the main}} threats {{encountered}} by <b>Arabian</b> <b>Bustards</b> {{are linked to}} human activities, either through direct destructions (poaching, killing, egg or chick collection), or by habitat loss. Recent changes in agricultural practices and spread of irrigation with the building of new wells have converted traditional fields into fruit trees plantations (banana, mango), unsuitable for the species.|$|R
50|$|The clutch size of <b>Arabian</b> <b>bustards</b> {{is one to}} two eggs {{which are}} laid in a shallow scrape on the ground. The females have sole {{responsibility}} for incubation of the eggs and rearing the young. When the brood is threatened the females has been observed to demonstrate diversionary behaviour, e.g. calling, refusing to flee, to distract potential predators from chicks.|$|R
50|$|Based on this {{information}} NARC {{is developing a}} small-scale captive-breeding programme of the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Bustard</b> {{with the aim of}} reinforcing wild populations.|$|E
50|$|Around 330 {{species of}} birds have been sighted in the park, notably the <b>Arabian</b> <b>bustard,</b> black crowned crane, Abyssinian ground {{hornbill}} (Bucorvus abyssinicus), martial eagle, bateleur (Terathopius ecaudatus), and white-faced duck (Dendrocygna viduata).|$|E
50|$|Over 500 {{species of}} bird have been {{recorded}} in Mauritania. Specialities and spectacular species include scissor-tailed kite, Nubian bustard, <b>Arabian</b> <b>bustard,</b> houbara bustard Egyptian plover, golden nightjar, chestnut-bellied starling, Kordofan lark and Sudan golden sparrow.|$|E
25|$|Birds {{include the}} ostrich, the endemic Archer's lark (Heteromirafra archeri), the {{secretary}} bird, <b>Arabian</b> and Kori <b>bustards,</b> Abyssinian roller, and crested francolin. In {{the southern part}} of the plain lies the Mille-Sardo Wildlife Reserve in Ethiopia.|$|R
50|$|Indigenous mammals {{include the}} leopard, hyena, fox, wolf, hare, oryx, and ibex. Birds include the vulture, eagle, stork, <b>bustard,</b> <b>Arabian</b> partridge, bee eater, falcon, and sunbird. In 2001, Oman had nine {{endangered}} species of mammals, five endangered types of birds, and nineteen threatened plant species. Decrees {{have been passed}} to protect endangered species, including the Arabian leopard, Arabian oryx, mountain gazelle, goitered gazelle, Arabian tahr, green sea turtle, hawksbill turtle, and olive ridley turtle. However, the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary is the first site ever to be deleted from UNESCO's World Heritage List, due to the government's decision to reduce the site to 10% of its former size so that the remainder could be opened to oil prospectors.|$|R
50|$|The Juba Game Reserve is a {{protected}} area in South Sudan, Africa. It {{is a game}} reserve and Important Bird Area. The 200 km2 savannah grassland and woodland habitat features key species of Heuglin's francolin and <b>Arabian</b> <b>bustard.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Arabian</b> <b>Bustard</b> (Ardeotis arabs) is a large, long-legged bird inhabiting arid environments {{across the}} Sahelo-Sudanese belt from Senegambia to Eritrea, {{with a small}} range {{extension}} on the Tihama plain on the south-western side of the Arabian Peninsula.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Arabian</b> <b>Bustard</b> {{feeds on}} grasshoppers, {{swarming}} locusts, beetles, crickets, caterpillars and other invertebrates, {{as well as}} vegetation {{in the form of}} seeds and fruit. Small vertebrates, like snakes, lizards and small rodents also make part of the diet.|$|E
50|$|As in all bustards, {{the male}} <b>Arabian</b> <b>bustard</b> {{is much larger}} than the female. Males have been found to weigh 5.7 - 10.9 kg, while females weigh 4.5 - 7.7 kg. The record-sized male <b>Arabian</b> <b>bustard</b> weighed 16.8 kg. These birds stand from 70 cm tall in females to 92 cm tall in males. They are fairly similar in overall {{appearance}} to the kori bustard, with a brown body, gray neck and white underside, but are noticeably smaller, with a more elegant, slender build. They are also differ in having white checkered covert pattern {{at the end of the}} folded wing, as opposed to various black-and-white patterns as seen in other large African bustards.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Arabian</b> <b>bustard</b> (Ardeotis arabs) is {{a species}} bustard which is found across the Sahel region of Africa and south western Arabia. It {{is part of}} the large-bodied genus, Ardeotis, and, though little known, appears to be a fairly typical species in that group.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} {{season of the}} <b>Arabian</b> <b>Bustard</b> seems to vary according to its location. It seems {{to be linked to}} rainfall, although generally it occurs from September to December in Arabia. The nest is a shallow scrape on the ground and females typically lay one or two eggs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Arabian</b> <b>Bustard</b> poses {{no threat}} to crops or {{livestock}} and local people are generally tolerant towards the bird. Public education through awareness campaigns aimed at both adults and children helps to illustrate the threats to the species {{and the necessity of}} taking action to protect the birds.|$|E
50|$|Of the avifauna, 5000-7000 Sudan {{crowned crane}} have been reported. Other bird life {{includes}} yellow-billed stork, Abdim's stork, African sacred ibis, <b>Arabian</b> <b>bustard,</b> African collared dove, golden nightjar, red-throated bee-eater, yellow-billed shrike, piapiac, red-pate cisticola, foxy cisticola, cricket longtail, Senegal eremomela, chestnut-bellied starling, black scrub-robin, chestnut-crowned sparrow-weaver, bush petronia, black-rumped waxbill.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Arabian</b> <b>Bustard</b> favours {{semi-arid}} {{and open}} grassy plains, arid bush country and savannah. In Yemen, the bird {{can also be}} found in cultivated areas. Birds in Yemen are known to seek cover in crops of sorghum and millet when the temperature peaks, indicating that cultivated crops provide some protection.|$|E
50|$|Several {{species such}} as golden nightjar, Sudan golden sparrow, hooded vulture, dark {{chanting}} goshawk, speckled pigeon, African mourning dove, blue-naped mousebird, Kordofan lark, red-chested swallow, chestnut-bellied starling, African swallow-tailed kite, tawny eagle, slender-billed curlew, demoiselle crane, <b>Arabian</b> <b>bustard,</b> ostrich, lappet-faced vulture, helmeted guineafowl are seemingly locally rare or extinct, or rather visitors of vagrants.|$|E
50|$|BirdLife International {{reported}} that 62 {{species of birds}} have been recorded in the Sambisa Game Reserve, including the guinea fowl, francolin, village weaver, Abyssinian ground hornbill, <b>Arabian</b> <b>bustard,</b> Savile's bustard, African collared-dove, chestnut-bellied starling, black scrub-robin and the Sudan golden sparrow. The forest was also {{thought to be the}} last remaining site of the ostrich in Nigeria.|$|E
50|$|He {{engraved}} some {{plates on}} behalf of Jean-Gabriel Prêtre for the 1821 Faune française, ou Histoire naturelle, générale et particulière des animaux qui se trouvent en France, and some for later editions of Georges Cuvier's Le Règne Animal. In Exploration scientifique de l'Algérie pendant les années 1840, 1841, 1842 he engraved plates including one of an <b>Arabian</b> <b>bustard,</b> painted by A.J.B. Vaillant.|$|E
50|$|Diawling National Park {{is home to}} a {{remarkable}} variety of birds. The species found here include northern pintail (Anas acuta), northern shoveler (Anas clypeata), greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus), lesser flamingo (Phoeniconaias minor), Eurasian spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia), African spoonbill (Platalea alba), great egret (Casmerodius albus), great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus), <b>Arabian</b> <b>bustard</b> (Ardeotis arabs), pied avocet (Recurvirostra avosetta), slender-billed gull (Larus genei), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), greater hoopoe-lark (Alaemon alaudipes) and Sudan golden sparrow (Passer luteus).|$|E
50|$|In this species, males average around 5 - 7 kg {{and measure}} around 80 cm {{in length and}} 180 cm in wingspan. Females are much smaller at around 3 kg and 60 cm in length and 150 cm across the wings. It is smaller than the {{sympatric}} <b>Arabian</b> <b>bustard,</b> {{as well as more}} rufous with a different body shape. Compared to larger bustards the Nubian has a more rounded body, a relatively long, thin neck and a rounded head.|$|E
50|$|There are 379 {{species of}} birds in the park {{including}} the contiguous Logone floodplain; among the birds that have been sighted are marbled duck, ferruginous duck, greater spotted eagle, scissor-tailed kite in grass lands, lesser kestrel, Nubian bustard (Neotis nuba), quail-plover, <b>Arabian</b> <b>bustard</b> Ardeotis arabs, hippos heron, hornbill, gross hopper, starks, Abyssinian roller, and fast moving ostrich. However, some of the species of global conservation concern are: Marmaronetta angustirostris, Aythya nyroca, Clanga clanga, Falco naumanni, Neotis nuba, which has been recorded once, in 1998.|$|E
50|$|The {{size and}} dark crest are {{generally}} diagnostic amongst the bustards {{found in the}} kori bustard's range. However, East Africa holds the greatest diversity of bustards anywhere, including some other quite large species, and these {{have the potential to}} cause confusion. Kori bustards are distinguished from Denham's bustard (Neotis denhamii) and Ludwig's bustard (Neotis luwigii), both of which they sometimes forage with, by their greyer appearance and by their lack of a tawny red hind-neck and upper mantle. In flight it can be distinguished from both of these somewhat smaller bustards by not displaying any white markings on the upperwing, which is uniformly grey here. Both Stanley's and Ludwig's bustards lack the kori's dark crest. More similar to, and nearly the same size as, the kori is the closely related <b>Arabian</b> <b>bustard</b> (Ardeotis arabs) (despite its name, the latter species ranges well into East Africa). However, the Arabian species has white-tipped wing coverts, a browner back and very fine neck vermiculations and also lacks the black base to the neck and the black in the wing coverts as seen in the kori.|$|E
