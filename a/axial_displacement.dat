In this study, a newly developed rectangular beam element is used. The element has lateral and <b>axial</b> <b>displacements</b> as degrees of freedom but no rotation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new displacement-based one-dimensional {{model for the}} analysis of multilayered composite beams. The kinematic restriction of cross sections rigid in their own planes is introduced. The <b>axial</b> <b>displacements</b> over the cross sections are represented in terms of explicitly defined piecewise polynomial warping functions with discontinuous derivatives at the interlaminae, whereas the amplitude of the displacements along the beam axis is established by means of a variational formulation. It is proved that the proposed representation of the <b>axial</b> <b>displacements</b> yields the exact solution of the interior domain problem for a beam subjected to a transverse load varying according to a polynomial law. It is shown that two or three coordinate functions are sufficient to yield continuous distributions of equilibrated stresses except for small neighborhoods of the constrained cross sections, where a higher number of warping functions could be used in order to obtain a better accuracy. The numerical results show excellent agreement with plane stress finite element and plane strain exact solutions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The <b>axial</b> <b>displacement</b> fault {{has very}} little {{indication}} before taking place and the fracture of oil film between thrust disk and tilt pads mainly contributes to this breakdown. Usually this fracture {{was caused by the}} contamination of oil or decrease of oil supply pressure which result in losing load bearing capacity of oil film. Also the increase of axial force caused by fluctuation of operation condition can result in the oil film fracture. Both of the above reasons can lead to tilt pads abrasion and emergency shutdown of machine. The method presented in this paper monitors the stiffness of oil film and identifies the reason of <b>axial</b> <b>displacement</b> increasing. By introducing the mechanism of <b>axial</b> <b>displacement</b> fault self-recovering and taking the <b>axial</b> <b>displacement</b> as the control objectives, the axial forces on rotor was controlled on-line and the minimum oil film thickness was ensured in real time.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a full-scale laboratory {{study of the}} axial sliding behaviour of a trenched pipeline surrounded by sand backfill. Cyclic <b>axial</b> <b>displacements</b> are applied to a heavy pipe buried in a narrow trench (less than three pipe diameters wide), using various backfill cover depths and two different soils: dry Hostun sand and a damp silty sand. A novel testing tank is employed, with compressible foam seals to allow the pipe to settle as it moves axially, and a pressure bag system to simulate backfill depths exceeding {{the height of the}} tank. The test pipe is instrumented to measure (a) the axial soil resistance developed on an isolated central section of pipe (thus avoiding tank boundary effects), and (b) the normal and shear contact stresses at a number of points around the pipe circumference. The results indicate that both the axial resistance and the normal stress distribution around the pipe can undergo considerable changes when a pipeline experiences cyclic <b>axial</b> <b>displacements.</b> An extreme case identified here is the potential for a compacted damp sand backfill to ‘arch’ completely over the pipe as a result of differential settlement, leading to unexpectedly low axial resistance.

The reaction force remains practically constant from 2.8 mm <b>axial</b> <b>displacement</b> until concrete failure, shown by the sudden decrease in the reaction force at 5.3 mm <b>axial</b> <b>displacement.</b> The almost constant normal force in the column without stirrups is explained by a sectional level balance between the exponential softening behaviour of concrete and the non-linear hardening behaviour of steel in the uniaxial constitutive laws of the layers. Concrete fails in crushing when its ultimate strain (ϵ _u^c = 0.0053) is reached and only the steel reinforcement then contributes to the axial reaction force from this point on. Due to the uniaxial loading condition concrete failure occurs simultaneously in all layers, which also corresponds to the final structural failure.
