5|$|For years, stories {{circulated}} of <b>a</b> <b>treasure</b> {{being buried}} within the amphitheater. W. T. McWhorter {{was determined to}} find out if it was true, so he planned to dynamite the amphitheater on the day he was to transfer the deed to the CoE. Spectators attended the planned explosion, but it was stopped just in time by CoE attorney David Waid.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 1993, a Coroner's inquest {{was held}} at Lowestoft, and the hoard was {{declared}} <b>a</b> <b>treasure</b> trove, meaning that it was deemed to have been hidden {{with the intention of}} being recovered at a later date. Under English common law, anything declared as such belongs to the Crown if no one claims title to it. However, at the time, the customary practice was to reward anyone who found and reported <b>a</b> <b>treasure</b> trove promptly with money equivalent to the market value of the treasure, with the money being provided by the national institution that wished to acquire the treasure. In November 1993, the Treasure Trove Reviewing Committee valued the hoard at £1.75 million (today £), which was paid to Lawes, as finder of the treasure. He shared his reward with the farmer, Peter Whatling. Three years later, the 1996 Treasure Act was enacted, which allowed for the finder, tenant and landowner to share in any reward.|$|E
50|$|Michael Stadther is {{an author}} {{best known for his}} book <b>A</b> <b>Treasure's</b> Trove: <b>A</b> Fairy Tale about Real Treasure for Parents and Children of All Ages.

5|$|Red Rackham's Treasure (1944) {{tells of}} the {{adventure}} Tintin and his friends undertake to recover the lost treasure of the pirate Red Rackham, believed by Tintin to be aboard the shipwrecked Unicorn. Sir Francis had built three models of the Unicorn and had hidden <b>a</b> <b>treasure</b> map inside each one. The adventure, told across both books, leads Tintin to the Unicorn and to the lost treasure.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} an {{individual}} – signified by the tolling of the bell – is thus <b>a</b> <b>treasure</b> buried {{at the bottom of}} a mine: only of value if it is given to someone who makes good use of it. In this he refers to the work of Augustine of Hippo, specifically On Christian Doctrine, in which Augustine describes the knowledge of pagans as gold and silver: something that can be involved in Christian purposes if appropriated properly. Donne, twisting this idea, is arguing that the {{death of an}}y individual is something others can learn from, should they understand it properly.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} portrayed a {{different}} persona of Madonna, rather than her film character {{for which it}} was released. Like the song, it incorporated Hispanic culture and portrayed her dressed in Spanish style as a young lady in search of <b>a</b> <b>treasure.</b> Madonna has performed the song on her Who's That Girl World Tour (1987) and on the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–2016). The song has been covered by many artists and has appeared in compilations and tribute albums.|$|E

5|$|According to the legend, the raskovnik could unlock any gate or padlock, {{regardless}} of its size, material or key. It could also uncover treasures buried in the ground: in Bulgarian beliefs, it could split {{the ground at the}} place where <b>a</b> <b>treasure</b> lay so that people could locate it. In some regions of Serbia, the treasure itself was a black man in chains who requested that a raskovnik be brought to him. The raskovnik would break the chains and the man would disappear into the ground {{to be replaced by a}} cauldron filled with gold coins. Other supernatural properties attributed to the herb by Bulgarians include the alchemic ability to transmute iron into gold, the more general ability to make the one who picked it forever happy or wealthy. In some interpretations, the raskovnik is a wonderful plant that makes true whatever its owner desires.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 70,000 Roman coins {{from all}} periods {{were found in}} Poland, starting with the 2nd century BC silver denarii. <b>A</b> <b>treasure</b> {{of these and other}} coins, some as early as the 1st century AD, was found in Połaniec, Staszów County, probably a booty captured around 19 AD from King Marbod of the Marcomanni. Greater waves of Roman money found their way to Poland throughout 1st and 2nd centuries and then again during 4th and 5th centuries, this time as bronze and golden solidi. The barbarians did not use them for commerce; they were being accumulated in dynastic treasuries of rulers and occasionally used for ceremonial gift exchange. The chiefs also kept large golden Roman medallions or their local imitations. The largest barbarian medallion, an equivalent of 48 solidii, {{is a part of the}} gold and silver treasure found in Zagórzyn near Kalisz.|$|E
5|$|Captain Archibald Haddock (Capitaine Haddock in Hergé's {{original}} version) is a Merchant Marine sea {{captain and}} Tintin's best friend. Introduced in The Crab with the Golden Claws, Haddock is initially {{depicted as a}} weak and alcoholic character, but later evolves to become genuinely heroic and even a socialite after he finds <b>a</b> <b>treasure</b> from his ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock (Chevalier François de Hadoque in the original version). The Captain's coarse humanity and sarcasm act as a counterpoint to Tintin's often-implausible heroism; he is always quick with a dry comment whenever the boy reporter seems too idealistic. After he and Tintin find Red Rackham's treasure, Captain Haddock lives in the luxurious mansion Marlinspike Hall (Le château de Moulinsart in the original French).|$|E

In mid-2007, Cadbury announced that it would be cutting around 7,500jobs. An internal memo which later leaked revealed that many of the jobs would be moved to Poland, causing an outcry from the manufacturers' trade unions.|$|E

5|$|The Action of 16 October 1799 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{during the}} French Revolutionary Wars between a squadron of British Royal Navy frigates and two frigates of the Spanish Navy close to the Spanish naval port of Vigo in Galicia.

Sighted by British frigate HMS Naiad enforcing the blockade of Vigo late on the 15 October, the Spanish ships were in the last stages of their journey.

5|$|The {{first book}} of Blyton's Five Find-Outers series, The Mystery of the Burnt Cottage, was {{published}} in 1943, as was the second book in the Faraway series, The Magic Faraway Tree, which in 2003 was voted 66th in the BBC's Big Read poll to find the UK's favourite book. Several of Blyton's works during this period have seaside themes; John Jolly by the Sea (1943), a picture book intended for younger readers, {{was published in}} a booklet format by Evans Brothers. Other books with a maritime theme include The Secret of Cliff Castle and Smuggler Ben, both attributed to Mary Pollock in 1943; The Island of Adventure, {{the first in the}} Adventure series of eight novels from 1944 onwards; and various novels of the Famous Five series such as Five on <b>a</b> <b>Treasure</b> Island (1942), Five on Kirrin Island Again (1947) and Five Go Down to the Sea (1953).|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins as}} three {{boys from the}} small Potos village disobey their Elder's {{instructions}} and trespass into a local waterfall, where <b>a</b> <b>treasure</b> {{is said to be}} kept. One of the boys stumbles and falls into the lake, where he finds a rusty sword embedded in a stone. Guided by a disembodied voice, he pulls the sword free, inadvertently unleashing monsters in the surrounding countryside of the village. The villagers interpret the sword's removal as a bad omen and banish the boy from Potos forever. A traveling knight named Jema recognizes the blade as the legendary Mana Sword and encourages the hero to re-energize it by visiting the eight Mana Temples.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} about a seaside town which was damaged by a cataclysm and consequently {{sunk into the}} depths of the earth. A town named Rogueport was later built at this site, with the fortunes of the lost kingdom fabled to exist behind the eponymous Thousand-Year Door, located in the ruins of the old town. Mario becomes involved when Princess Peach contacts him about <b>a</b> <b>treasure</b> map that she bought in Rogueport, but becomes part of a larger adventure after learning that Peach has gone missing. With the help of Goombella and Professor Frankly, Mario learns that the map can potentially reveal the location of the 7 legendary Crystal Stars, which are required to unlock the Thousand-Year Door. Under the assumption that Peach herself is trying to find the Crystal Stars, he uses the map in an attempt to locate her.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{platform}} format was {{a departure}} from the original ToeJam & Earl, <b>a</b> <b>treasure</b> hunt game with randomly generated levels, inspired by the game Rogue. Creators Greg Johnson and Mark Voorsanger originally began designing a game built on the concepts of the original, but changed to a more generic type of game {{due to a lack of}} support for their vision on the part of Sega. The game was critically well received, with reviewers praising the graphics, soundtrack, fluid action and two-player mode. It was also a commercial success, but fans of ToeJam & Earl were disappointed and confused by the radical change in direction.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{persistent}} rumours of <b>a</b> <b>treasure</b> hidden by Richard II {{somewhere in the}} castle grounds. Richard {{is supposed to have}} hidden part of his personal wealth at Beeston on his journey to Chester in 1399, before boarding a ship to Ireland to suppress a rebellion there. On his return, Richard was deposed by Henry, Duke of Lancaster, the future Henry IV, and his treasure is said to have remained undiscovered. Many searches have been carried out, most of them focusing on the deep well in the inner bailey, but nothing has ever been found. The rumour of hidden treasure may not be well-founded, as Henry IV is recorded as having recovered Richard's gold and jewellery from its various hiding places.|$|E
5|$|Senel and {{his team}} are joined by <b>a</b> <b>treasure</b> hunter named Norma as well as Moses, who has decided to atone for his earlier actions.

After being forced to escape when they are confronted by Vaclav's underlings, the Terrors, the party regroups and meets an amnesiac women named Grune and boy named Jay who joins the team and accompanies them to the Legacy's bridge. They confront Vaclav once more, who plans to use Shirley and Stella's latent Merines powers to activate a giant laser cannon located on the ship to destroy the Ferines' village and later subjugate other countries around the world. Although the party is victorious, Vaclav sets the cannon to fire in his final moments, with Stella in turn awakening her powers {{just in time to}} fly into the path of the beam, sacrificing herself.|$|E
