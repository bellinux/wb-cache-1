40|$|ABSTRACT: In acute lung injury, a {{decrease}} in surface-active large <b>aggregates</b> {{and an increase in}} the less surface-active small surfactant <b>aggregates</b> are observed. The objective of the current study was to determine if the increase in small <b>aggregates</b> interfered with the function of large <b>aggregates,</b> thereby independently contributing to lung dysfunction. Isolated large <b>aggregates,</b> small <b>aggregates,</b> and large aggregatezsmall <b>aggregate</b> combinations were analysed for in vitro surface activity utilizing a pulsating bubble surfactometer. Subsequently, large <b>aggregates,</b> small <b>aggregates,</b> and large aggregatez small <b>aggregate</b> combinations were administered to surfactant-deficient, adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Physiological parameters were measured during 1 h of ventilation. After sacrifice, the whole lung lavage was analysed for protein concentration, and surface activity of the recovered large <b>aggregates.</b> The minimum surface tension of the large aggregatezsmall <b>aggregate</b> preparations (10 mN?m- 1) was significantly higher than large <b>aggregates</b> alone (1 mN?m- 1), but lower than small <b>aggregates</b> alone (21 mN?m- 1) after 100 pulsations. In vivo, rats receiving large aggregateszsmall <b>aggregates</b> showed immediate increases in oxygena-tion, similar to animals given large <b>aggregates,</b> whereas animals given small <b>aggregates</b> and control animals maintained low oxygenation values. In conclusion, small <b>aggregates</b> interfered with large <b>aggregates</b> function in vitro, but this was not observed in vivo in this experimental model...|$|R

This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the mechanical properties of fly ash artificial geopolymer <b>aggregates</b> with natural <b>aggregate</b> (rock) in term of its impact strength, specific gravity and water absorption. The raw materials used were fly ash, sodium hydroxide, sodium silicate and natural <b>aggregate.</b> After the artificial geopolymer <b>aggregate</b> has been produced, its water absorption, specific gravity and <b>aggregate</b> impact test has been done. All results obtained were compared to natural <b>aggregate.</b> The result shows that the fly ash geopolymer <b>aggregate</b> are lighter than natural <b>aggregate</b> in term of its specific gravity. The impact value for fly ash artificial geopolymer <b>aggregate</b> slightly high compared to natural <b>aggregate</b> while it has high water absorption value compared to natural <b>aggregate.</b> As conclusion, the fly ash artificial geopolymer <b>aggregate</b> can be used as one of the construction materials in concrete as an alternative for coarse <b>aggregate</b> besides natural <b>aggregate</b> with more lightweight properties...|$|R

5|$|Each {{chromatophore}} contains pigment of {{only one}} colour. In fish and frogs, colour change is mediated {{by the type of}} chromatophores known as melanophores that contain dark pigment. A melanophore is star-shaped; it contains many small pigmented organelles which can be dispersed throughout the cell, or <b>aggregated</b> near its centre. When the pigmented organelles are dispersed, the cell makes a patch of the animal's skin appear dark; when they are <b>aggregated,</b> most of the cell, and the animal's skin, appears light. In frogs, the change is controlled relatively slowly, mainly by hormones. In fish, the change is controlled by the brain, which sends signals directly to the chromatophores, as well as producing hormones.|$|E
