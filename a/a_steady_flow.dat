In August 1279, in preparation for resuming his offensive against Michael along the Via Egnatia, Charles appointed as his vicar-general in Albania the Burgundian Hugo de Sully. Over the next year, Sully received <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>flow</b> of supplies, siege equipment and reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|During sexual arousal, the {{clitoris}} and {{the whole}} of the genitalia engorge and change color as the erectile tissues fill with blood (vasocongestion), and the individual experiences vaginal contractions. The ischiocavernosus and bulbocavernosus muscles, which insert into the corpora cavernosa, contract and compress the dorsal vein of the clitoris (the only vein that drains the blood from the spaces in the corpora cavernosa) and the arterial blood continues <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>flow</b> and, having no way to drain out, fills the venous spaces until they become turgid and engorged with blood. This is what leads to clitoral erection.|$|E

5|$|Alexander I Aldea (14311436) was {{the first}} Romanian ruler {{to be forced to}} render {{military}} service to the Ottomans. Two decades later, Vlad III the Impaler (1448, 14561462, 1476), notorious as the model for the Dracula legend, turned against the Ottoman Empire. He carried out a series of attacks across the Danube in the winter of 14611462. The response was a massive invasion led by Mehmed II who drove Vlad III from the throne and replaced him with his brother, Radu III the Fair (14621475). Due to the frequent military operations, the Wallachian Plain was heavily depopulated {{after the end of the}} 14thcentury.

5|$|Various {{concepts}} were mooted for the A-4's deployment in a March 1942 {{study by}} Walter Dornberger, {{the head of}} the A-4 development project at the Peenemünde Army Research Center. He suggested that the missiles should be based in heavily defended fixed sites of a bunker-style design similar to the massive submarine pens then under construction in occupied France and Norway. The rockets could be stored in such sites, armed, fuelled from an on-site LOX production plant, and launched. This offered significant technical advantages; not only would the LOX loss be minimised, but the complex process of pre-launch testing would be simplified. A high rate of fire could be sustained as the facility could effectively operate like a production line, sending <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>flow</b> of missiles to the launch pads.|$|E
5|$|Vigorous {{degassing}} {{of carbon}} dioxide occurs from several vents in two bogs near Nazko Cone. These vents are {{in the form of}} small isolated travertine mounds on the bog surface. A mound with a partially submerged vent had been identified in 2013 with <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>flow</b> {{of carbon dioxide}}. Several new vents with no travertine mound were actively releasing carbon dioxide gas in 2015. Analysis of the carbon-13 isotope in the carbon dioxide gas emissions suggest a magmatic origin. This has led to the possibility of a volcanic geothermal system, the existence of which has been investigated by Geoscience BC as part of their Targeting Resources for Exploration and Knowledge project. The lack of hot springs and geothermal evidence on the surface suggest that the heat source of such a system would be very deep underground.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1925, Pflueger {{designed}} a , 28-story, step-back skyscraper made of brick framed with steel, {{along the lines}} of his just-completed Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company Building. Its main decorative theme was neo-Gothic, expressed strongly in the three Gothic arches which formed the main street-level entrance for the church. The Great Hall, the large worship area located within the second, third and fourth floors was to seat 1,500 churchgoers and a smaller chapel was designed for 125 more. A grand pipe organ from Skinner Organ Company was installed with four manuals controlling 3,881 pipes. A stained glass window was placed 80 feet above the sanctuary, representing Faith, Love and Hope in three tall, narrow panels. Two assembly halls could be combined to hold 1,100 attendees for theatrical or athletic events. Some 500 guest rooms and 32 tower apartments were intended to bring <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>flow</b> of visitors and a source of profit to the church. Though never the tallest building in San Francisco, it was to be the tallest hotel on the Pacific Coast for many decades.|$|E

The work was carried on both in a 1 -foot diameter model tunnel and in a 5 -foot full-size tunnel, and wherever possible comparison was made between them.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{stability}} of a rigid body in <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> rotational <b>flow</b> of <b>an</b> inviscid incompressible fluid.

Arnold's method is exploited to obtain sufficient conditions for linear stability of an equilibrium of a body in <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> rotational <b>flow.</b> We first establish a new energy-type variational principle which is a natural generalization of the well-known Amold's result (1965 a, 1966) to the system "body + fluid.
