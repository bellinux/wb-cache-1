60|$|The celebrated sculptor, Mr. Woolner, informs me of {{one little}} {{peculiarity}} {{in the external}} ear, which he has often observed both in men and women, and of which he perceived the full significance. His attention was first called to the subject whilst at work on his figure of Puck, {{to which he had}} given pointed ears. He was thus led to examine the ears of various monkeys, and subsequently more carefully those of man. The peculiarity consists in a little blunt point, projecting from the inwardly folded margin, or helix. When present, it is developed at birth, and, according to Prof. Ludwig Meyer, more frequently in man than in woman. Mr. Woolner made an exact model of one such case, and sent me the accompanying drawing. (Fig. 2). These points not only project inwards towards the centre of the ear, but often a little outwards from its plane, so as to be visible when the head is viewed from directly in front or behind. They are variable in size, and somewhat in position, standing either a little higher or lower; and they sometimes occur on one ear and not on the other. They are not confined to mankind, for I observed a case in one of the spider-monkeys (Ateles beelzebuth) in our Zoological Gardens; and Mr. E. Ray Lankester informs me of another case in a chimpanzee in the gardens at Hamburg. The helix obviously consists of the extreme margin of the ear folded inwards; and this folding appears to be in some manner connected with the whole external ear being permanently pressed backwards. In many monkeys, which do not stand high in the order, as baboons and some species of macacus (32. See also some remarks, and the drawings of the ears of the Lemuroidea, in Messrs. Murie and Mivart's excellent paper in 'Transactions of the Zoological Society,' vol. vii. 1869, pp. 6 and 90.), the upper portion of the ear is slightly pointed, and the margin is not at all folded inwards; but if the margin were to be thus folded, a slight point would necessarily project inwards towards the centre, and probably a little outwards from the plane of the ear; and this I believe to be their origin in many cases. On the other hand, Prof. L. Meyer, in an able paper recently published (33. 'Uber das Darwin'sche Spitzohr,' Archiv fur Path. Anat. und Phys., 1871, p. 485.), maintains that the whole case is one of mere variability; and that the projections are not real ones, but are due to the internal cartilage {{on each side of the}} points not having been fully developed. I am quite ready to admit that this is the correct explanation in many instances, as in those figured by Prof. Meyer, in which there are several minute points, or the whole margin is sinuous. I have myself seen, through the kindness of Dr. L. Down, the ear of a microcephalous idiot, on which there is a projection on the outside of the helix, and not on the inward folded edge, so that this point can have no relation to a former <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear.</b> Nevertheless in some cases, my original view, that the points are vestiges of the tips of formerly erect and pointed ears, still seems to me probable. I think so from the frequency of their occurrence, and from the general correspondence in position with that of the tip of a pointed ear. In one case, of which a photograph has been sent me, the projection is so large, that supposing, in accordance with Prof. Meyer's view, the ear to be made perfect by the equal development of the cartilage throughout the whole extent of the margin, it would have covered fully one-third of the whole ear. Two cases have been communicated to me, one in North America, and the other in England, in which the upper margin is not at all folded inwards, but is pointed, so that it closely resembles the pointed ear of an ordinary quadruped in outline. In one of these cases, which was that of a young child, the father compared the ear with the drawing which I have given (34. 'The Expression of the Emotions,' p. 136.) of the ear of a monkey, the Cynopithecus niger, and says that their outlines are closely similar. If, in these two cases, the margin had been folded inwards in the normal manner, an inward projection must have been formed. I may add that in two other cases the outline still remains somewhat pointed, although the margin of the upper part of the ear is normally folded inwards--in one of them, however, very narrowly. [Fig.3. Foetus of an Orang(?). Exact copy of a photograph, shewing the form of the ear at this early age.] The following woodcut (No. 3) is an accurate copy of a photograph of the foetus of an orang (kindly sent me by Dr. Nitsche), in which it may be seen how different the pointed outline of the ear is at this period from its adult condition, when it bears a close general resemblance to that of man. It is evident that the folding over of the tip of such an ear, unless it changed greatly during its further development, would give rise to a point projecting inwards. On the whole, it still seems to me probable that the points in question are in some cases, both in man and apes, vestiges of a former condition.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{enzootic}} {{focus of}} vesicular stomatitis virus New Jersey serotype (VSV-NJ) exists on Ossabaw Island, Georgia. Many questions regarding <b>the</b> epizootiology <b>of</b> this virus at this focus still exist, but {{evidence suggests that}} the vector for this virus is a phlebotomine sand fly (Lutzomyia shannoni), with feral swine serving as a potential source <b>of</b> virus for <b>the</b> sand fly and for other swine via contact transmission. We conducted 2 experimental trials in domestic swine using VSV-NJ isolated from a sand fly from Ossabaw Island to determine if route of inoculation or immunosuppression via steroid administration affected <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> disease, viremia, viral shedding, or the neutralizing antibody response. In a third trial, we studied the potential for contact transmission among swine using this isolate. Virus isolations were made from nasal cavity or palatine tonsil <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soft palate, and VSV-NJ neutralizing antibodies developed when pigs were inoculated intradermally in <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snout, <b>ear,</b> or coronary band, intravenously, intranasally, or via scarification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snout or coronary band.

Steroid treatment did not potentiate <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> secondary vesicles and did not prolong <b>the</b> period <b>of</b> virus shedding from VSV-NJ-infected swine. Contact transmission, as determined by shedding <b>of</b> virus from <b>the</b> tonsil <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soft palate and <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> VSV-NJ neutralizing antibodies, occurred in pigs in contact with animals inoculated in <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snou...|$|R

50|$|The dorsal pelage of the white-sided jackrabbit {{is short}} and coarse. The color is pale {{cinnamon}} color heavily mixed with black. The underparts are white with traces of colored patches {{in front of the}} thighs. The tail has black hairs tipped with white on the upper surface and is all white on the underside. The sides are distinguishable from other species in that they are pure white, the source of their name. The rump and thighs are also white and lined with a few black hairs. A median black line concealed by sooty, brownish, and white-tipped hairs divides the rump. The limbs are white, but their outer surfaces are stained a buff color. The gular pouch is also buffy while the sides of the neck and shoulders become more ochraceous in color. The head is a cream buff color, mixed with black, with whitish areas around the sides of the eyes. The ears are covered with short yellowish-brown hairs that are mixed with black anteriorly and white posteriorly. The <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> is white-tipped. Below the <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> is a tuft of black hair. The long fringes on the anterior edge of the ear are ochraceous buff, while the fringes of the tip of the ear and posterior edge are white. The inner surface of the ear is almost bare except for a dusky spot on the posterior border. The nape is ochraceous buff in color.|$|E
40|$|If the kernels {{from the}} base of the ear are selected, the most {{vigorous}} pollens are indirectly being selected, considering that seeds placed at the base of the ear will have a better genetic constitution, because they are pollinated by more vigorous gametes. The length of the silk from the embryo sacs at the base is longer, compared to the length of those placed in the <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> since each inflorescence receives thousands of pollen grains that certainly compete against each other. To test this hypothesis, the objective of the present work was to verify if the position of the kernel in the ear affected the grain yield and other traits of the plant differently and if that difference could be enlarged among the selective cycles. For this, in 1995 / 1996, 3. 000 plants of the CMS- 39 population were sowed in isolation and 300 ears were selected randomly. From each ear, kernels were collected from approximately three centimeters of the extremities. The ones from the apex were mixed and the same was done with those {{from the base}}. This procedure was repeated in five selective cycles in a similar way. The 10 subpopulations, five from the apex and five from the base, were evaluated in trials carried out in 2000 / 2001 and 2001 / 2002. The experimental design used randomized blocks with six replications in a split-plot scheme. The plots constituted the five selective cycles and the subplots the origin of the kernels, apex or base. The traits evaluated were the number of days for male and female flowering, ear height and grain yield. It was verified that the origin of the kernels from apex or base did not alter the expression of the evaluated traits. It was not possible, from the experimental precision obtained, to detect among all the considered traits, the effect of the indirect selection on the pollen vigor based on the position of the kernels in the ear...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} <b>the</b> amplitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subcoracoid space under maximum {{internal and}} external rotations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> humeral head and measure the distance between <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coracoid process and the following anatomical structures: (a) point <b>of</b> entry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> musculocutaneous nerve and its branches into the coracobrachial muscles and into <b>the</b> short head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biceps brachii muscle; (b) acromial artery; (c) lesser tubercle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> humerus. METHOD: Thirty shoulders of fresh cadavers, without any kind of shoulder pathology, (9 males and 6 females) were dissected, and the distances (in mm) were measured between the anatomical structures defined above and <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coracoid process. RESULTS: The mean distance between <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coracoid process and the musculocutaneous nerve was 49. 2 mm (in all specimens a proximal branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nerve was identified 34. 2 mm away from <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coracoid process), which was not significantly different between the sexes or body sides; the mean distance between <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coracoid process and the acromial artery was 12. 4 mm, which was not significantly different between the sexes or body sides; the mean distance between <b>the</b> <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coracoid process and <b>the</b> lesser tubercle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> humerus, with the humeral head under internal rotation, was 10. 6 mm in men and 8. 6 mm in women, values that were significantly different between the sexes.
