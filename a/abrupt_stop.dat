5|$|The Reformation brought Roskilde's {{development}} to an <b>abrupt</b> <b>stop.</b> While the cathedral {{continued to be}} the preferred location for the entombment of the Danish monarchs, {{most of the other}} religious institutions disappeared. For the next three centuries, the city suffered a series of disasters including the effects of the Dano-Swedish War which terminated with the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, the plague in 1710 and 1711, and a series of fires in 1730. Conditions improved in 1835 when the city became the Assembly of the Estates of the Realm (Rådgivende Stænderforsamling) and in 1847 with the railway connecting Copenhagen and Roskilde.|$|E
5|$|Alcohol {{detoxification}} or 'detox' for alcoholics is an <b>abrupt</b> <b>stop</b> {{of alcohol}} drinking {{coupled with the}} substitution of drugs, such as benzodiazepines, that have similar effects to prevent alcohol withdrawal. Individuals who are only at risk of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be detoxified as outpatients. Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome {{as well as those}} who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients. Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism, and it is necessary to follow up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for alcohol dependence or abuse to reduce the risk of relapse. Some symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as depressed mood and anxiety typically take weeks or months to abate while other symptoms persist longer due to persisting neuroadaptations. Alcoholism has serious adverse effects on brain function; on average it takes one year of abstinence to recover from the cognitive deficits incurred by chronic alcohol abuse.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, 2006 at 4:45 pm, a {{structural}} {{failure in the}} 'Rose Bowl' section of the ride created a bump on the track that caused a train {{to come to an}} <b>abrupt</b> <b>stop.</b> Twenty-seven injuries were reported in the accident and rescue units were required to evacuate the riders. Most of the injuries were of the chest or neck. Seventeen people were released from the hospital within five hours of the accident, and two were admitted. None of the injuries were life-threatening. After an inspection the following day, the park stated that the accident was caused by a crack or split in the wood. The ride was shut down {{for an extended period of}} time, while the park worked with the State of Ohio to complete a full investigation. The park completed repairs of the ride but the state asked for extensive testing to be done to ensure it would not happen again. The park indicated that the ride would not reopen until the 2007 season.|$|E

25|$|Beginners tend {{to point}} with the rod {{to where they}} want to throw, but the {{movement}} of the hand has to be a controlled speed-up and then come to an <b>abrupt</b> <b>stop.</b> The rod will then start to unfurl and the tip of the rod will reach a high speed in the required direction. The high speed of the rod tip toward the target gives the impulse to make the cast, the <b>abrupt</b> <b>stop</b> and retreat of the rod tip is essential for the formation of a loop. Experienced fishermen also improve the speed of the line leaving the rod tip by a technique called hauling, applying a quick fast pull with the hand holding the line. At the end of the cast when the line is stretched the line as a whole will still have speed and the fisherman can let some extra line through their fingers making a false throw, either forward or backward or to finish the cast and start fishing.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the use of}} the Aimsun microsimulation program to simulate vehicle violating behaviors and observe their impact on road traffic crash risk. Plugins for violations of speeding, slow driving, and <b>abrupt</b> <b>stopping</b> were developed using Aimsun's API and SDK module. A safety analysis plugin for investigating probability of rear-end collisions was developed, and a method for analyzing collision risk is proposed. A Fuzzy C-mean Clustering algorithm was developed to identify high risk states in different road segments over time. Results of a simulation experiment based on the G 15 Expressway in Shanghai showed that <b>abrupt</b> <b>stopping</b> had the greatest impact on increasing collision risk, and the impact of violations increased with traffic volume. The methodology allows for the evaluation and monitoring of risks, alerting of road hazards, and identification of hotspots, and could be applied to the operations of existing facilities or planning of future ones...|$|R
25|$|Another {{cause of}} {{delirium}} tremens is <b>abrupt</b> <b>stopping</b> of tranquilizer drugs of the barbiturate or benzodiazepine classes {{in a person}} with a relatively strong addiction to them. Because these tranquilizers' primary pharmacological and physiological effects stem from their manipulation of the GABA chemical and transmitter somatic system, the same neurotransmitter system affected by alcohol, delirium tremens can occur upon abrupt decrease of dosage in those who are heavily dependent. These DTs are much the same as those caused by alcohol and so is the attendant withdrawal syndrome of which they are a manifestation. That is the primary reason benzodiazepines are such an effective treatment for DTs, despite also being the cause of them in many cases. Because ethanol and tranquilizers such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines function as positive allosteric modulators at GABAA receptors, the brain, in its desire to equalize an unbalanced chemical system, triggers the <b>abrupt</b> <b>stopping</b> of the production of endogenous GABA. This decrease becomes more and more marked as the addiction becomes stronger and as higher doses are needed to cause intoxication. In addition to having sedative properties, GABA is an immensely important regulatory neurotransmitter that controls the heart rate, blood pressure, and seizure threshold among myriad other important autonomic nervous subsystems.|$|R
40|$|The {{operation}} of a large high-speed engine under transient loading conditions was investigated, using a detailed simulation code {{in conjunction with a}} model capable of predicting compressor surging. Engine loadings were applied, which were considered dangerous for initiating compressor surging and cases where compressor surging could occur were identified. A means of avoiding compressor surging by opening a bypass valve connected between the compressor outlet and turbine inlet was examined. Finally, the case of engine <b>abrupt</b> <b>stopping</b> by rapidly closing the engine emergency shutdown valve, located down-stream of the compressor, was also investigated...|$|R
25|$|Nylon mania {{came to an}} <b>abrupt</b> <b>stop</b> {{at the end of}} 1941 {{when the}} USA entered World War II. The {{production}} capacity that had been built up to produce nylon stockings, or just nylons, for American women was taken over to manufacture vast numbers of parachutes for fliers and paratroopers. After the war ended, DuPont went back to selling nylon to the public, engaging in another promotional campaign in 1946 that resulted in an even bigger craze, triggering the so-called nylon riots.|$|E
25|$|The project {{came to an}} <b>abrupt</b> <b>stop</b> on December 7, 1941, {{with the}} bombing of Pearl Harbor by Japanese forces. The United States entered into World War II. Bids for the {{reconstruction}} of the McLean House were reopened on November 25, 1947 and work continued. Eighty four years after the historic surrender, reuniting the country, the McLean House was opened by the National Park Service {{for the first time to}} the public on April 9, 1949. In front of a crowd of approximately twenty thousand people a speech was given by Pulitzer Prize winning historian Douglas Southall Freeman. A ribbon was cut by the guests of honor at the dedication ceremony by Major General Ulysses S. Grant III and Robert E. Lee IV on April 16, 1950.|$|E
25|$|Coins {{can also}} be spun {{on a flat surface}} such as a table. This results in the {{following}} phenomenon: as the coin falls over and rolls on its edge, it spins faster and faster (formally, the precession rate of the symmetry axis of the coin, i.e., the axis passing from one face of the coin to the other) before coming to an <b>abrupt</b> <b>stop.</b> This is mathematically modeled as a finite-time singularity – the precession rate is accelerating to infinity, before it suddenly stops, and has been studied using high speed photography and devices such as Euler's Disk. The slowing down is predominantly caused by rolling friction (air resistance is minor), and the singularity (divergence of the precession rate) can be modeled as a power law with exponent approximately −1/3.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{introduction}} of the VHS format, VHS tape rewinders were developed. These devices served the sole purpose of rewinding VHS tapes. Proponents of the rewinders argued that the use of the rewind function on the standard VHS player would lead to wear and tear of the transport mechanism. The rewinder would rewind the tapes smoothly and also normally do so at a faster rate than the standard rewind function on VHS players. However some rewinder brands did have some frequent <b>abrupt</b> <b>stops,</b> which occasionally led to tape damage.|$|R

2500|$|The {{absolutely}} unambiguous {{evidence and}} unanimous {{agreement of the}} early Muslim sources is that the Arabs <b>abrupt</b> <b>stop</b> was caused solely and exclusively by the superb military resistance of the Christian Nubians[...]. the Nubian Dam. The array of those early sources includes {{the two most important}} chronicles of early Islam, al-Tabari (d. 926) and al-Yaqubi (d. 905); the two best extant books on the Muslim conquests, al-Baladhuri (d. 892) and Ibn al-A tham al-Kufi (d. 926); the most central encyclopedic work of al-Masudi (d.956); and the two best early sources dedicated specifically to Egypt, Ibn Abd al-Hakim (d. 871) and al-Kindi (961).. All of the above-cited sources attribute Nubian success to their superb archery.. To this central factor should be added the combination of the Nubians' military prowess and Christian zeal; their acquaintance of the terrain; the narrowness of the front line that they had to defend; and, quite possibly, the series of cataracts situated at their back, and other natural obstacles.. The Nubians fought the Muslims very fiercely. When they encountered them they showered them with arrows, until all of them were wounded and they withdrew with many wounds and gouged eyes. Therefore they were called [...] "the marksmen of the eye." ...|$|E
50|$|With the AK-47's {{long-stroke}} piston gas system, {{the piston}} is mechanically {{fixed to the}} bolt group and moves through the entire operating cycle. The primary disadvantage to this system is the disruption of the point of aim due {{to the center of}} mass changing during the action cycle and energetic and <b>abrupt</b> <b>stops</b> {{at the beginning and end}} of bolt carrier travel. However, the AK-47's heavier weight and slower rate-of-fire do a good job of mitigating any disadvantage. In addition, newer AK-47 type rifles use a muzzle brake or compensator to reduce recoil. Some AK type rifles also have vertical foregrips to improve handling characteristics and to counter the effects of recoil.|$|R
