METHODS: <b>Absorbe</b> dose measurements {{were made at}} SSD= 95 cm distance, 10 x 10 cm standart cone and reference depth. Electron energies was measured with five different cylindirical chambers and three different paralel plate chambers. Polarity and recombination effects were measured for all ionization chambers and energies before absorbed dose measurements. RESULTS: After the measurements, calculations were made according to three different protocols. For Marcus parallel plate chambers, the ratio of <b>absorbe</b> dose protocols was between - 2. 04 % to 2. 64 %. Except from Marcus for other parallel plate chamber difference was between 0. 11 % to 3. 38 % for 6 MeV, 0. 33 % to 1. 37 % for 8 MeV, 0. 12 % to 1. 71 % for 10 MeV, 1. 35 % to 0. 23 % for 12 MeV, 1. 69 % to 0. 24 % for 15 MeV and 0. 22 % to 1. 74 % for 18 MeV.

For small values of ϵ a critical-like behaviour could be observed, when the acceleration due to radiation pressure and the deceleration induced by the increasing self-gravity of the brane roughly compensate each other, and cosmological evolution is approximately the same as without radiation. Lighter (heavier) branes than those with the critical energy density will recollapse slower (faster). This feature is obstructed at high values of ϵ, where the overall effect of the radiation is to speed-up the recollapse. We determine the maximal value of the transmission rate for which the critical-like behaviour is observed.

Since CH 2 O could be progressively increased with {{no evidence of a}} maximal rate during loading with hypotonic (2. 5 %) mannitol, it was concluded that there is no limit on distal tubular sodium transport during mannitol loading. In contrast, during hypotonic (0. 45 %) saline loading CH 2 O rose initially, but as urine flow (V) exceeded 25 % of the filtered load CH 2 O attained maximal levels (up to 20 % of the filtered load) and remained stable as V increased to 50 % of the filtered load. It was concluded that saline loading progressively inhibits proximal sodium reabsorption. Initially, the distal tubule <b>absorbes</b> a large fraction of the proximal rejectate and sodium excretion rises slightly.

This gives rise to suitable algebraic notions of Poisson homology and cohomology for an arbitrary Poisson algebra. A geometric version thereof includes the canonical homology and Poisson cohomology of a Poisson manifold introduced by Brylinski, Koszul, and Lichnerowicz, and <b>absorbes</b> the latter in standard homological algebra by expressing them as Tor and Ext groups, respectively, over a suitable algebra of differential operators. Furthermore, the Poisson structure determines a closed 2 -form in the complex computing Poisson cohomology. This 2 -form generalizes the 2 -form defining a symplectic structure on a smooth manifold; moreover, the class of that 2 -form in Poisson cohomology generalizes the class in de Rham cohomology of a symplectic structure on a smooth manifold and appears as a crucial ingredient for the construction of suitable linear representations of A, viewed as a Lie algebra; representations of this kind occur in quantum theory. To describe this class and to construct the representations, we relate formal concepts of connection and curvature generalizing the classical ones with extensions of Lie algebras. We illustrate our results with a number of examples of Poisson algebras and with a quantization procedure for a relativistic particle with zero rest mass and spin zero. Comment: 56 page...|$|R

In addition, there has been made calculations of heat gained by the solar system {{in the course of a}} day. The effect of reduced transmission at an increasing angle of incidence, has been discussed. Comparisons of the two models show a minor improvement in efficiency in the latest solar collector models. Comparing daily energy gain for the system show the similar result. The difference is seen most clearly when considering efficiency per. A solar heating system consists of a solar collector, a heat store and a heat distribution system. The system examined in this thesis, has water as a heat carrier medium, and a pump that circulates the water through the solar collectors. The essential elements of a solar collector are the collector plate which can transfer energy from the sun to the water, and a cover sheet. The latter’s function is to prevent heat loss from the collector plate, and as such it makes the solar collectors function as a green house. Efficiency is an indicator of how well the solar collector, eventually the entire system, manages to exploit solar energy. In the thesis, efficiency has been analysed using a calorimetric method. Here the large storage tank holding almost 500 litres is used as a calorimeter. An easy way of measuring efficiency is looking at the increase in temperature in the heat store, and total radiation in the course of one day. Studies of the new solar collectors show that as much as 50 % of the energy received by the solar collectors in the course of a day is useful energy. The flow rate tells us how fast the water flows through the collector plates. The water <b>absorbes</b> energy from the collector plates, which are heated by the sun.

Dans certaines conditions d'utilisation, celui-ci subit une dégradation de ses propriétés mécaniques et physico-chimiques initiales. Des échanges de matières s'établissent entre le matériau et le fluide transporté : des composés constitutifs du fluide (eau, hydrocarbures) peuvent être <b>absorbés</b> par le polyamide {{tandis que}} le principal additif du matériau (le plastifiant) est extrait. Cette étude, entreprise pour déterminer l'influence de la composition du milieu chimique sur les propriétés du polyamide 11, a permis : 1) De développer une nouvelle méthode d'analyse des matières diffusant dans le polyamide 11. Le principe de cette méthode consiste à réaliser une thermodésorption des différentes matières présentes dans le polymère et à les analyser en ligne par spectrométrie de masse à moyenne résolution (résolution = 3000). Cette méthode permet l'analyse quantitative simultanée du plastifiant résiduel, de l'eau et des hydrocarbures <b>absorbés</b> ainsi que la détermination de la répartition par familles chimiques de ces hydrocarbures. 2) De proposer un modèle prédictif du vieillissement du polyamide 11 dans des milieux modèles constitués d'eau, d'une coupe gazole principalement aliphatique et d'une coupe gazole principalement aromatique. La composition de ces différents milieux de vieillissement a été choisie à l'aide d'un plan d'expériences appliqué aux mélanges. L'influence de l'eau sur les propriétés mécaniques (diminution de l'allongement à la rupture) et physico-chimiques (diminution de la masse moléculaire moyenne et augmentation du taux de cristallinité) a été mise en évidence. Par ailleurs, {{quel que soit}} le milieu de vieillissement, à 140 °C, le plastifiant est extrait du polyamide. L'influence du milieu aromatique sur la plastification du matériau a été démontrée et a pu être attribuée à certains types d'hydrocarbures dont la nature a été précisée. Les résultats obtenus ont permis de conclure que le phénomène principal mis en jeu au cours du vieillissement est une hydrolyse causée par l'eau absorbée dans le matériau et qui entraîne une coupure des chaînes macromoléculaires et la fragilisation du polymère. 3) D'étendre l'application du modèle établi avec des coupes gazoles au cas d'un vieillissement dans un pétrole brut et de vérifier son caractère prédictif. Polyamide 11 {{is used as a}} leakproof sheath inside flexible flowlines for petroleum products. Under some operating conditions, this polymer undergoes a degradation of its original physicochemical and mechanical properties, which may be assimilated with a phenomenon of aging. Material exchanges occur between polyamide 11 and the fluid transported. The components present in the fluid (water, hydrocarbons) may be absorbed, and the principal additive of the material (the plasticizer) is extracted. This study was carried out to determine the influence of the composition of the chemical environment of aging on the properties of polyamide 11. In the first phase, a new analysis method was developed for quantifying diffusing materials in polyamide 11. Effectively, several techniques can be used for determining such materials. However, interference problems may be encountered when the polymer is in contact with oil containing sulfur-bearing products. Likewise, none of these techniques is capable of simultaneously making a complete analysis of all the materials. The principle of the method developed consists in performing a thermodesorption of the different materials present in the polymer and in analyzing them on line by medium-resolution mass spectrometry (resolution = 3000). This resolution is also capable of determining the distribution, by chemical families, of the hydrocarbons absorbed. The method was checked with aged polyamide 11 samples containing either a single type of material or several materials. These materials were analyzed at the same time by thermodesorption coupled with mass spectrometry and by other techniques. The results obtained show that this new method is capable of quantitatively and simultaneous determining : (1) the residual plasticizer content, (2) the water and absorbed-hydrocarbon content, and (3) the distribution, by chemical families, of the absorbed hydrocarbons (alkanes, cycloalkanes, aromatics). In the second phase, since polyamide 11 has varying affinity for the different chemical families present in a petroleum environment, we tried to determine the influence of each type of compound on the mechanical properties (ultimate elongation) and physicochemical properties (rate of crystallinity, molecular weight, contents of diffusing materials). Aging was performed in the laboratory in model environments made up in varying proportions, i. e. water, a gas-oil cut composed mainly of aromatic hydrocarbons, a gas-oil cut composed mainly of aliphatic hydrocarbons. The composition of these different aging environments was chosen by means of an experimental plan applied to the mixtures, and a polynomial mathematical model has been postulated. The conditions of temperature, pressure and aging time were set at a constant level for all the tests, i. e. 140 °C, 6 bar of nitrogen, 15 days. The model obtained was used to plot isoresponse curves and to predict the properties analyzed {{as a function of the}} composition of the environment. The influence of water on the degradation of the mechanical properties (decrease in ultimate elongation) and the physicochemical properties (reduction of the molecular weight and increase in the rate of crystallinity) was revealed. Likewise, it was shown that, no matter what the aging environment was at 140 °C, the plasticizer is extracted and the aromatic environment influences the plastication of the material. By means of mass spectrometry, the chemical nature of the aromatic hydrocarbons absorbed preferentially, and having a pasticating role, was determined. These are two-cycle aromatics (alkylnaphthalenes, acenaphthenes, diphenyls, acenaphthylenes, fluorenes) and sulfur-containing aromatics (benzothiophenes and dibenzothiophenes). The different results led to the conclusion that the principal phenomenon involved in aging is a hydrolysis caused by the presence of absorbed water in the material, which leads to the cutting of the macromolecular chains and embrittlement of the polymer. Lastly, the model created with gas-oil cuts was applied to a case of aging of a crude oil, and this led to the satisfactory prediction of how the mechanical and physicochernical properties of the polymer evolve in such an environment...|$|R
40|$|L'ingestion de la caséine par des souris à raison de 100 mg/jour entraine une réponse lymphoblastique in vitro. Les {{processus}} d'hydrolyse par les enzymes digestives n'éliminent pas les déterminants antigéniques de la caséine. La production d'igg totale n'est pas accompagnée par la production d'igg spécifiques. Il n'existe pas d'indication de production d'ige par les souris. Cependant, l'accumulation d'histamine dans les mastocytes a été observée. Les résultats des expériences d'absorption intestinale en utilisant les sacs intestinaux retournés de souris montrent des passages des antigènes issus des caséines et de leurs hydrolysats obtenus par l'action des enzymes digestives. L'absorption de fragments issus de la caséine et de ses hydrolysats de poids moléculaires inferieurs à 3000 da a été mise en évidence. Ces fragments ainsi <b>absorbés</b> contiennent toujours des sites antigéniques. L'antigenicite des caséines natives et de leurs hydrolysats est retrouvée dans les fractions clhp testées. Les étapes de la sensibilisation par les caséines peuvent être résumées comme suit : consommation des caséines (antigènes) [...] -> absorption des peptides antigéniques (p. m. 3000 da) [...] -> sensibilisation des lymphocytes. Feeding 100 mg/day of casein in mice {{resulted in}} in vitro lymphoblastic {{responses in the}} presence of the anttgen and total IgG production in the plasma as well as in the culture supernatants. This sensibilization was evaluated by lymphoblastic transformation test (LIT) where the presence of casetn in the culture medium stimulated lymphocytes 3 H-thymidine incorporation. Casein ingestion at younger age (before 2 months) sensitized the mice more rapidly and intensively. Lymphocytes sensitized by casein ingestion recogntzed in vitro not only casein but its digestive enzyme hydrolysed fragments, which signifled that the hydrolysts processes by the three enzymes did not eliminate the antigents determinant of casein. Plasma and cultured lymphocyte total IgG productions were not accompanied by the production of specific IgG anti casein. In addition, there was no indication of IgE production in the fed mice, as was shown by the negative results of mastocyte histamine antigenic liberation test and cutaneous test. However, mastocyte histamine accumulation was observed in the fed mice. Since lymphocyte sensttization and mastocyte histamine accumulation caused by casein ingestion are important factors in allergie reactions, the results of this study should be considered in casein feeding practice. The results of intestinal absorption experiments using mouse everted intestinal sacs revealed the passage of antigens issued from casein and its peptic (P) and peptic-tryptic-chymotryptic (PTC) hydrolysates. Further analysis by electrophoresis and autoradiography showed only the absorption of fragments derived from P hydrolysate, which had a molecular wetght around 2500 Da. However, identification by ultrafiltration method showed the absorption of peptides issued from casein and its hydrolysates having the molecular welght inferior to 3000 Da. These absorbed fragments sttll contained the anttgentc sites, as demonstrated by the results of the immunodotting and radioimmunodotting tests. The anttgentcity of casein and its hydrolysate HPLC fractions were determined by ELISA and immunodotting method [...] ...|$|R
