5|$|Overlordship was {{a central}} feature of Anglo-Saxon {{politics}} which began before Æthelberht's time; kings were described as overlords {{as late as the}} ninth century. The Anglo-Saxon invasion may have involved military coordination of different groups within the invaders, with a leader who had authority over many different groups; Ælle of Sussex may have been such a leader. Once the new states began to form, conflicts among them began. Tribute from dependents could lead to wealth. A weaker state <b>also</b> <b>might</b> ask or pay for the protection of a stronger neighbour against a warlike third state.|$|E
5|$|Understanding {{of how the}} Sun is {{expected}} to continue to evolve required an understanding of the source of its power. Arthur Stanley Eddington's confirmation of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity led to his realisation that the Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion reactions in its core, fusing hydrogen into helium. In 1935, Eddington went further and suggested that other elements <b>also</b> <b>might</b> form within stars. Fred Hoyle elaborated on this premise by arguing that evolved stars called red giants created many elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in their cores. When a red giant finally casts off its outer layers, these elements would then be recycled to form other star systems.|$|E
5|$|Whereas many {{pitchers}} throw with a three-quarter or sidearm motion, Koufax threw with {{a pronounced}} over-the-top arm action. This may have increased his velocity, but reduced the lateral movement on his pitches, especially {{movement away from}} left-handed hitters. Most of his velocity came from his strong legs and back, combined with a high kicking wind-up and long forward stretch toward the plate. Throughout his career, Koufax relied mostly on two pitches. His four-seam fastball gave batters the impression of rising as it approached them, due to underspin. It not only appeared to move very late but <b>also</b> <b>might</b> move two or three distinct times. His overhand curveball, spun with the middle finger, dropped vertically 12 to 24inches due to his arm action. Rob Neyer called it the best curve of all time. He also occasionally threw a changeup and a forkball.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{oscilloscopes}} have direct-coupled deflection amplifiers, {{which means}} the trace could be deflected off-screen. They <b>also</b> <b>might</b> have their beam blanked without the operator knowing it. To help in restoring a visible display, the beam finder circuit overrides any blanking and limits the beam deflected to the visible portion of the screen. Beam-finder circuits often distort the trace while activated.|$|E

These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated {{under the direction of}} four separate documents {{in the course of the}} state's constitutional history. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King Charles II of England through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.|$|E

25|$|Vaccines have {{historically}} been {{the most effective means}} to fight and eradicate infectious diseases. Limitations to their effectiveness, nevertheless, exist. Sometimes, protection fails because the host's immune system simply does not respond adequately or at all. Lack of response commonly results from clinical factors such as diabetes, steroid use, HIV infection or age. It <b>also</b> <b>might</b> fail for genetic reasons if the host's immune system includes no strains of B cells that can generate antibodies suited to reacting effectively and binding to the antigens associated with the pathogen.|$|E

Clean questions incorporate all {{or some of the}} client's specific phrasing and <b>might</b> <b>also</b> include other auditory components of the client's communication such as sighs, pitch, tonality, etc. The questioner <b>might</b> <b>also</b> draw attention to any non-verbal signals that coincide with the client's auditory output, e.g., a fist being raised simultaneously with a sigh, that <b>might</b> <b>also</b> represent elements of the client's metaphorical representation of experience.|$|R
25|$|The {{principal}} {{maritime customs}} ports were then: Tunis, Sfax, Mahdia, Jerba, and Gabés (all in Tunisia); Oran, Bougie (Béjaïa), and Bône (Annaba) (in Algeria); and Tripoli (in Libya). At such ports generally, the imports were off loaded {{and transferred to}} a customs area from where they were deposited in a sealed wharehouse, or funduq, until the duties and fees were paid. The amount imposed varied, usually five or ten percent. The Tunis customs service was a stratified bureaucracy. At its head was often {{a member of the}} ruling nobility or musharif, called al-Caid, who not only managed the staff collecting duties but <b>also</b> <b>might</b> negotiate commercial agreements, conclude treaties, and act as judge in legal disputes involving foreigners.|$|E
25|$|Data mining {{requires}} {{data preparation}} which can uncover information or patterns which may compromise confidentiality and privacy obligations. A common way {{for this to}} occur is through data aggregation. Data aggregation involves combining data together (possibly from various sources) {{in a way that}} facilitates analysis (but that <b>also</b> <b>might</b> make identification of private, individual-level data deducible or otherwise apparent). This is not data mining per se, but a result of the preparation of data before – and for the purposes of – the analysis. The threat to an individual's privacy comes into play when the data, once compiled, cause the data miner, or anyone who has access to the newly compiled data set, to be able to identify specific individuals, especially when the data were originally anonymous.|$|E
25|$|Full {{automation}} commonly {{defined as}} requiring no control or very limited control by the driver; such automation would be accomplished {{through a combination}} of sensor, computer, and communications systems in vehicles and along the roadway. Fully automated driving would, in theory, allow closer vehicle spacing and higher speeds, which could enhance traffic capacity in places where additional road building is physically impossible, politically unacceptable, or prohibitively expensive. Automated controls <b>also</b> <b>might</b> enhance road safety by reducing the opportunity for driver error, which causes a large share of motor vehicle crashes. Other potential benefits include improved air quality (as a result of more-efficient traffic flows), increased fuel economy, and spin-off technologies generated during research and development related to automated highway systems.|$|E

25|$|Below the {{substantial}} landholders were those engaged in subsistence agriculture, {{who made up}} the majority of the working population. Those with property rights included husbandmen, lesser landholders and free tenants. Below them were the cottars, who often shared rights to common pasture, occupied small portions of land and participated in joint farming as hired labour. Farms <b>also</b> <b>might</b> have grassmen, who had rights only to grazing. By the early modern era in Lowland rural society, as in England, many young people, both male and female, left home to become domestic and agricultural servants. Women acted as {{an important part of the}} workforce. As well as moving away from their families as farm servants, married women worked with their husbands around the farm, taking part in all the major agricultural tasks. They had a particular role as shearers in the harvest, forming most of the reaping team of the bandwin.|$|E
25|$|By {{the fourteenth}} century most farming {{was based on the}} Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, {{settlements}} of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams. These were allocated in run rigs to tenant farmers, who were usually known as husbandmen or bonders. The average amount of land used by a husbandman in Scotland, known as a husbandland, was 26 acres, or 2 oxgangs. They would also have had a share of hay meadow and common pasture. Below the husbandmen, lesser landholders and free tenants, were the cottars, who often shared rights to common pasture, occupied small portions of land and participated in joint farming as hired labour. Farms <b>also</b> <b>might</b> have grassmen, who had rights only to grazing. Pasture was often accessed by shieling-grounds, with shelters made of stone or turf, used for the grazing of cattle in summer. These would often be distant from the main settlements in the Lowlands, but might be relatively close in the more remote Highlands.|$|E
25|$|Buddhist monks {{traditionally}} {{were called}} upon to perform a number of functions in Cambodian life. They participated in all formal village festivals, ceremonies, marriages, and funerals. They <b>also</b> <b>might</b> have participated in ceremonies to name infants and in other minor ceremonies or rites of passage. Monks did not lead the ceremonies, however, because that role {{was given to the}} achar, or master of ceremonies; the monk's major function was to say prayers of blessing. They were often healers and, in traditional Khmer culture, they were the practitioners whose role was closest to that of modern psychiatrists. They might also have been skilled in astrology. The monk traditionally occupied a unique position in the transmission of Khmer culture and values. By his way of life, he provided a living model of the most meritorious behavior a Buddhist could follow. He also provided the laity with many opportunities for gaining merit. For centuries monks were the only literate people residing in rural communities; they acted as teachers to temple servants, to novices, and to newly ordained monks. Until the 1970s, most literate Cambodian males gained literacy solely through the instruction of the sangha.|$|E
