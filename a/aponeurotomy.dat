50|$|The main {{categories}} {{listed by}} the International Dupuytren Society {{in order of}} stage of disease are radiation therapy, needle <b>aponeurotomy</b> (NA), collagenase injection and hand surgery.|$|E
5000|$|Needle <b>aponeurotomy</b> is most {{effective}} at [...] "Stage I and Stage II" [...] of 6-90 degrees of deformation. However, it is also used at other stages.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of needle <b>aponeurotomy</b> is the minimal intervention without incision (done {{in the office}} under local anesthesia) and the very rapid return to normal activities without need for rehabilitation, but the nodules may resume growing. A study reported postoperative gain is greater at the MCP-joint level than {{at the level of}} the IP-joint and found a reoperation rate of 24%; complications are scarce. Needle <b>aponeurotomy</b> may be performed on fingers that are severely bent (stage IV), and not just in early stages. A 2003 study showed 85% recurrence rate after 5 years.|$|E
50|$|The patient burden after open {{surgery is}} high, {{therefore}} less invasive techniques may be preferred. New {{studies have been}} conducted for percutaneous release, extensive percutaneous <b>aponeurotomy</b> with lipografting and collagenase. These treatments show promise.|$|E
50|$|A {{technique}} {{introduced in}} 2011 is extensive percutaneous <b>aponeurotomy</b> with lipografting. This procedure also uses a needle {{to cut the}} cords. The difference with the percutaneous needle fasciotomy is, that the cord is cut at many places. The cord is also separated from the skin to make place for the lipograft that is taken from the abdomen or ipsilateral flank. This technique shortens the recovery time. The fat graft results in supple skin.|$|E
50|$|Needle <b>aponeurotomy</b> is a minimally-invasive {{technique}} {{where the}} cords are weakened through the insertion and manipulation {{of a small}} needle. The cord is sectioned at as many levels {{as possible in the}} palm and fingers, depending on the location and extent of the disease, using a 25 Gauge needle mounted on a 10 ml syringe. Once weakened, the offending cords can be snapped by putting tension on the finger(s) and pulling the finger(s) straight. After the treatment a small dressing is applied for 24 hours. After these 24 hours patient are able to use their hands normally. No splints or physiotherapy are given.|$|E
50|$|A {{comprehensive}} review {{of the results of}} needle <b>aponeurotomy</b> in 1,013 fingers was performed by Gary M. Pess, MD, Rebecca Pess, DPT and Rachel Pess, PsyD and published in the Journal of Hand Surgery April 2012. Minimal followup was 3 years. Metacarpophalangeal joint (MP) contractures were corrected an average of 99% and Proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) contractures an average of 89% immediately post procedure. At final follow-up, 72% of the correction was maintained for MP joints and 31% for PIP joints. The difference between the final corrections for MP versus PIP joints was statistically significant. When a comparison was performed between patients age 55 years and older versus under 55 years, there was a statistically significant difference at both MP and PIP joints, with greater correction maintained in the older group. Gender differences were not statistically significant. Needle <b>aponeurotomy</b> provided successful correction to 5° or less contracture immediately post procedure in 98% (791) of MP joints and 67% (350) of PIP joints. There was recurrence of 20° or less over the original post procedure corrected level in 80% (646) of MP joints and 35% (183) of PIP joints. Complications were rare except for skin tears, which occurred in 3.4% (34) of digits. This study showed that NA is a safe procedure that can be performed in an outpatient setting. The complication rate was low, but recurrences were frequent in younger patients and for PIP contractures.|$|E
50|$|Before the <b>aponeurotomy,</b> a liposuction {{is done to}} {{the abdomen}} and {{ipsilateral}} flank to collect the lipograft. The treatment can be performed under regional or general anesthesia. The digits are placed under maximal extension tension using a firm lead hand retractor. The surgeon makes multiple palmar puncture wounds with small nicks. The tension on the cords is crucial, because tight constricting bands are most susceptible to be cut and torn by the small nicks, whereas the relatively loose neurovascular structures are spared. After the cord is completely cut and separated from the skin the lipograft is injected under the skin. A total of about 5 to 10 ml is injected per ray.|$|E
40|$|Intervention {{with the}} {{continuity}} of the tendon and part of the muscle fibers allows investigation of myofascial force transmission. The present study investigates the effects of proximal <b>aponeurotomy</b> on length-force characteristics and the geometry of the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle, and compares those effects with the effects of both distal tenotomy (TT) and intramuscular fasciotomy (IF) of the EDL. After proximal <b>aponeurotomy,</b> the intramuscular connective tissue ruptured spontaneously below the location of intervention. Due to this rupturing, a gap developed within the proximal aponeurosis. The fibers that were continuous with the tendon at only one end were substantially shorter than before the intervention. Optimum muscle force was reduced by 29 %. After distal TT (of heads II-IV) a gap developed within the muscle belly. This gap increased at higher muscle lengths. However, the length of the gap was much smaller than after <b>aponeurotomy.</b> Despite the TT-related gap, there was no rupturing of intramuscular connective tissue at the interface between heads IV and V, as there was after proximal <b>aponeurotomy.</b> The effects of TT on length-force characteristics and on lengths of fibers continuous with the tendon at only one end were much less compared to the effects of <b>aponeurotomy.</b> Subsequent IF for two-thirds the length of the interface between heads IV and V resulted in changes similar to the effects of proximal <b>aponeurotomy</b> plus rupture. The contrast regarding the occurrence of intramuscular connective tissue rupture indicates increased failure strength of the intramuscular connective tissue at distal locations. It is hypothesized that for multitendoned muscles in vivo, local shear and stress deformations will initiate local adaptation of the intramuscular connective tissue. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Variables {{associated}} with recurrent Dupuytren’s disease, or a ‘diathesis’, have been investigated, but those {{associated with}} functional outcome and complications are less well studied. Outcomes 1 or 5 [*]years after an <b>aponeurotomy,</b> fasciectomy or dermofasciectomy were assessed by patient interview and examination at five UK centres. A total of 432 procedures were studied. The reoperation rate did not differ at 1 [*]year (p[*]=[*] 0. 396, Chi-square test with Monte Carlo simulation), but was higher after <b>aponeurotomy</b> in the 5 -year group (30 %, versus 6 % after fasciectomy and 0 % after dermofasciectomy, p[*]=[*] 0. 003, Chi square test with Monte Carlo simulation). Loss of function (DASH> 15) did not differ between procedures at 5 [*]years, even when reoperation and other variables were controlled. Diabetes, female gender and previous ipsilateral surgery were associated with poorer function in logistic regression analysis. The variables associated with poor function after treatments differ from diathesis variables. <b>Aponeurotomy</b> had lower complication rates than fasciectomy and dermofasciectomy. This may counterbalance the former’s higher recurrence rate and explain why <b>aponeurotomy</b> demonstrated similar long-term functional outcome compared with excisional surgery in this study...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{effects of}} {{intramuscular}} <b>aponeurotomy</b> on muscle force and geometry {{as a function}} to muscle length were studied in rat m. gastrocnemius medialis (GM). Acutely after <b>aponeurotomy,</b> activation of the muscle at increasing lengths (acute trajectory) showed a spontaneous and progressive but partial tearing of the connective tissue interface between the fibres inserting directly proximally and distally {{to the location of}} the section. After this the muscle consisted morphologically of a stable proximal and a distal part (post-aponeurotomy). Post-aponeurotomy mean active sarcomere length within fibres of the proximal part was shown to be unaffected. In contrast, mean sarcomere length within the distal part was reduced substantially after <b>aponeurotomy.</b> However active sarcomeres in the distal part were still attaining higher lengths with increasing muscle lengths (p < 0. 005), indicating myofascial force transmission through the intact part of the connective tissue interface of the muscle parts. Post-aponeurotomy optimum muscle force was reduced substantially to less than 45 % of pre-aponeurotomy values. During the acute trajectory the muscle yielded approximately 20 % higher forces than post-aponeurotomy, indicating that myofascial force transmission was related to the area of connective tissue interface. It is concluded that after <b>aponeurotomy</b> of the proximal aponeurosis of rat GM, fibres without direct myotendinous connection to the origin of the muscle are still able to contribute to muscle force. As the magnitude of reduction in muscle force can only be explained partially by the spontaneous rupture of the connective tissue interface between proximal and distal muscle part, other factors causing a decrease of muscle force are present. Clinical implication of acute effects of intramuscular <b>aponeurotomy</b> are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{location}} of <b>aponeurotomy</b> on the muscular mechanics of extramuscularly connected muscle were assessed. Using finite element modeling, extensor digitorum longus muscle {{of the rat}} was studied {{for the effects of}} <b>aponeurotomy</b> performed in each of three locations on the proximal aponeurosis: (1) a proximal location (case P), (2) an intermediate location (case I), and (3) a distal location (case D). Proximo-distal force differences were more pronounced for more proximal <b>aponeurotomy.</b> The location also affected proximally and distally assessed muscle length-force characteristics: (1) Muscle optimum length and active slack length shifted differentially to higher lengths, increasing slack to optimum length range (for D to P: distally by 15 - 44 %; proximally by 2 - 6 %). (2) Muscle forces decreased at all lengths (e. g., for D to P distal optimal force = 88 - 68 % and proximal optimal force = 87 - 60 % of intact values, respectively). Increased length range and force decreases were highest for case P, as were effects on muscle geometry: gap length within the proximal aponeurosis; decreased proximal fiber population pennation angle. Parallel, but not serial, heterogeneity of sarcomere length was highest in case P: (a) For the distal fiber population, sarcomere shortening was highest; (b) for the proximal population, sarcomeres were longer. It is concluded that if <b>aponeurotomy</b> is performed closer to the tendon, intended surgical effects are more pronounced. For bi-articular muscle, mechanics of both proximal and distal joints will be affected, which should be considered in selecting the location of <b>aponeurotomy</b> for optimal results at both joints.

40|$|<b>Aponeurotomy,</b> {{which is}} the transection of an {{aponeurosis}} perpendicular to its length, is performed to lengthen spastic and/or short muscles. During recovery, the cut ends of the aponeurosis are reconnected by new connective tissue bridging both ends. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the histological features of this new connective tissue as well as its mechanical properties after recovery from <b>aponeurotomy.</b> For this purpose, <b>aponeurotomy</b> was performed on the proximal aponeurosis of rat m. gastrocnemius medialis (GM), which was followed by six weeks of recovery. The lengths of aponeurotic tissues were measured as a function of active muscle length. The results are compared to a control group as well as to the acute effects and a sham operated group. Activation of the muscle at increasing lengths after <b>aponeurotomy</b> caused a gap between the cut ends of the aponeurosis. However, after recovery, new connective tissue is formed bridging the aponeurotic ends, consisting of thin collagen fibres, which are densely packed and generally arranged in the direction of the aponeurosis. The number of fibroblasts was three to five times higher than that of aponeurotic tissue of the intact parts as well as that of the acute and sham operated muscles. The strain of the new connective tissue as a function of active muscle length was shown to be about three times higher than that of the aponeurosis. It is concluded that the inserted new aponeurotic tissue is more compliant and that the aponeurosis becomes 10 - 15 % longer than in untreated muscle. As a consequence, the muscle fibres located distally to the new aponeurotic tissue will become shorter than prior to <b>aponeurotomy.</b> This explains a shift of the length-force curve, which favours the restoration of the range of joint motion. © 2004 Orthopaedic Research Society.

40|$|Background: Dupuytren‘s {{disease is}} {{progressive}} disorder, which affects the palmar fascia {{and results in}} irreversible flexion posture of the fingers. Etiology is unknown and significant risk factors include old age, male sex, white northern European extraction, presence of positive family history of Dupuytren’s disease, and diabetes mellitus. [1] Treatment is mainly surgical resection but it carries a long recovery period and significant rate of complications. Objective: To present our experience with a minimally invasive technique of percutaneous needle <b>aponeurotomy</b> (PNA) and lipografting Methods: The procedure of PNA and lipografting consists of percutaneus needle <b>aponeurotomy,</b> which is Lermisiaux modified technique and subdermal lipofilling. After the contracture release using a small hypodermic needle we inject the space between subcutaneous tissue and fascial cord with autologous lipoaspirate. We treated 15 patients with 22 rays. Primary outcome measures were total passive extension deficit improvement at one week and 4 th weeks. Results: The average total passive extension deficit (TPED) before treatment measured 86, 33 ° at ray and postoperative mean TPED measured 22, 13 °. Immediately after release the mean flexion contracture correction of metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint was from 44, 33 ° to 1, 38 ° degrees with 100...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Dupuytren’s disease (DD) {{is a type}} of fibromatosis which {{progressively}} {{results in}} the shortening and thickening of the fibrous tissue of the palmar fascia. This condition which predominantly affects white-northern Europeans has been identified since 1614. DD can affect certain activities of daily living such as face washing, combing hair and putting hand in a glove. The origin of Dupuytren’s contracture is still unknown, but {{there are a number of}} treatments that doctors have come across throughout the years. Historically surgery has been the mainstay treatment for DD but not the only one. The objective is to make a structured review of the most recent advances in treatment of DD including the surgical and medical interventions. We have looked at the most relevant published articles regarding the various treatment options for DD. This review has taken 55 articles into consideration which have met the inclusion criteria. The most recent treatments used are multi-needle <b>aponeurotomy,</b> extensive percutaneous <b>aponeurotomy</b> and lipografting, injecting collagenase Clostridium histolyticum, INF-gamma and shockwave therapy as well as radiotherapy. Each of these treatments has certain advantages and drawbacks and cannot be used for every patient. In order to prevent this condition, spending more time and money in the topic is required to reach better and more consistent treatments and ultimately to eradicate this disease...|$|E
40|$|Effects of extramuscular myofascial force {{transmission}} on the acute effects of <b>aponeurotomy</b> were studied using {{finite element modeling}} and implications of such effects on surgery were discussed.

The specific goal {{was to assess the}} alterations in muscle length-force characteristics in relation to sarcomere length distributions and to investigate how the mechanical mechanism of the intervention is affected if the muscle is not isolated. Major effects of extramuscular myofascial {{force transmission}} were shown on muscle length-force characteristics.

30|$|Results: Ten {{cases of}} snake bites were {{admitted}} during this period, boys accounted for 100 % {{of the study}} population. The average age was 3.5  years [11  months- 6.5  years]. All bites occurred during the day (40 % {{in the morning and}} 60 % in the afternoon). The average time to admission to intensive care was 10.2  h. The site of the bite was in the upper limb in 80 % and the limb inferior in 20 % of the cases. According to the classification of the envenomation— 60 % of the cases were of severity of grade 2 – 3 and 40 % of grade 0 – 1. All grade 2 – 3 envenomations had received antivenom serotherapy and antibiotic therapy, and only one case had an <b>aponeurotomy.</b> Changes were favorable in all children with an average hospital stay of 5  days.|$|E
30|$|A 49 -year-old woman, with no {{remarkable}} medical history, had fever, {{cough and}} myalgia of 2 -week duration. She {{was referred to}} the ED for acute dyspnea and circulatory failure. At admission, her blood pressure was 120 / 100  mmHg, pulse 137 /min and severe cardiogenic pulmonary edema required rapid intubation. TTE-measured LVEF was at 20 %. Antibiotics and oseltamivir were started for suspected fulminant myocarditis. Despite maximal inotropic support, adequate perfusion could not be achieved and femoral–femoral VA-ECMO was implanted, complicated {{a few hours later}} by acute right inferior limb ischemia with compartment syndrome. On day 2, partial hemodynamic improvement allowed ECMO removal and right limb <b>aponeurotomy.</b> Abdominal ultrasonography visualized a large right adrenal mass. LV systolic function recovered fully. Antihypertensive medications (prazosin and β-blockers) were started. Right adrenalectomy was performed 6  weeks later; histologic examination of the mass confirmed the pheochromocytoma diagnosis.|$|E
40|$|Effects of extramuscular myofascial force {{transmission}} on the acute effects of <b>aponeurotomy</b> were studied using {{finite element modeling}} and implications of such effects on surgery were discussed. Aponeurotomized EDL muscle of the rat was modeled in two conditions: (1) fully isolated (2) with intact extramuscular connections. The specific goal {{was to assess the}} alterations in muscle length-force characteristics in relation to sarcomere length distributions and to investigate how the mechanical mechanism of the intervention is affected if the muscle is not isolated. Major effects of extramuscular myofascial {{force transmission}} were shown on muscle length-force characteristics. In contrast to the identical proximal and distal forces of the aponeurotomized isolated muscle, substantial proximo-distal force differences were shown for aponeurotomized muscle with extramuscular connections (for all muscle lengths F dist > F prox after distal muscle lengthening). Proximal optimal length did not change whereas distal optimal length was lower (by 0. 5 mm). The optimal forces of the aponeurotomized muscle with extramuscular connections exerted at both proximal and distal tendons were lower than that of isolated muscle (by 15 and 7 %, respectively). The length of the gap separating the two cut ends of the intervened aponeurosis decreases substantially due to extramuscular myofascial force transmission. The amplitude of the difference in gap length was muscle length dependent (maximally 11. 6 % of the gap length of the extramuscularly connected muscle). Extramuscular myofascial force transmission has substantial effects on distributions of lengths of sarcomeres within the muscle fiber populations distal and proximal to the location of intervention: (a) Within the distal population, the substantial sarcomere shortening at the proximal ends of muscle fibers due to the intervention remained unaffected however, extramuscular myofascial force transmission caused a more pronounced serial distribution towards the distal ends of muscle fibers. (b) In contrast, extramuscular myofascial force transmission limits the serial distribution of sarcomere lengths shown for the aponeurotomized isolated muscle in the proximal population. Fiber stress distributions showed that extramuscular myofascial force transmission causes most sarcomeres within the aponeurotomized muscle to attain lengths favorable for higher force exertion. It is concluded that acute effects of <b>aponeurotomy</b> on muscular mechanics are affected greatly by extramuscular myofascial force transmission. Such effects have important implications for the outcome of surgery performed to improve impeded function since muscle in vivo is not isolated both anatomically and mechanically...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIntroductionThe etiology, treatment, {{and patient}} {{management}} {{in cases of}} chronic epicondylitis, within the legislation on occupational disease, remain highly controversial. HypothesisRecognition as an occupational disease has a negative influence on the functional result of epicondylitis treated with <b>aponeurotomy</b> and neurolysis of the motor branch of the radial nerve. Patients and methodsTwenty-eight patients (30 cases of epicondylitis) were operated between January 2007 and January 2008. There were nine men and 19 women whose mean age was 46. 1 years. A preoperative EMG found anomalies in the deep posterior interosseous nerve in all cases. Patients {{were divided into two}} groups: one group of patients recognized as having an occupational disease and a group of patients whose disease was not considered occupation-related. ResultsThe patients were seen at follow-up at a mean 21. 8 months. In the group of patients with occupational disease, there were six excellent, nine good, and five acceptable results; in the second group, there were six excellent, two good, and two acceptable results. ConclusionRecognition of epicondylitis as an occupational disease has a significant influence only on the time to pain relief and the result on strength. Level of evidenceLevel IV.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{an attempt}} to provide {{minimally}} invasive treatment for Dupuytren's disease, percutaneous disruption of the affected tissue followed by lipografting is being tested. Contractile myofibroblasts drive this fibroproliferative disorder, whereas stem cells have recently been implicated in preventing fibrosis. Therefore, the authors tested the role of stem cells in modulating myofibroblast activity in Dupuytren's disease. METHODS: The authors compared the effect of co-culturing Dupuytren's myofibroblasts with either adipose-derived or bone-marrow-derived stem cells on isometric force contraction and associated levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin mRNA and protein expression. The authors also tested {{the effect of these}} stem cells on Dupuytren's myofibroblast proliferation and assessed whether this was mediated by cell-to-cell contact or by a paracrine mechanism. RESULTS: Addition of adipose-derived stem cells to Dupuytren's myofibroblasts reduced the contraction of the latter, with a corresponding reduction of alpha-smooth muscle actin protein expression, probably through a dilution effect. In contrast, bone marrow-derived stem cells increased myofibroblast contractility. In addition, adipose-derived stem cells inhibit myofibroblast proliferation and mediate these effects by soluble factors, influenced by cell-to-cell contact-dependent signaling. CONCLUSION: Adipose-derived stem cells inhibit the contractile myofibroblast in Dupuytren's disease, and these findings lend support to the potential benefit of lipografting in conjunction with <b>aponeurotomy</b> as a novel strategy for the treatment of Dupuytren's disease...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe goal of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} hospitalization for treatment of Dupuytren's disease in France between 2002 and 2009. MethodsA repeated, annual, cross-sectional national survey of public and private French hospitals was performed between 2002 and 2009, with planned selection criteria for data extraction. Outcomes were age, sex, number of hospitalizations, length of stays, and types of surgical procedure. Types of surgical procedure included aponeurectomy, <b>aponeurotomy,</b> transplantation (skin graft), arthrolysis, amputation, arthrodesis, combined procedures. ResultsThe selected hospital stays represented 95 % to 97 % of all stays with Dupuytren's disease coded as the primary diagnosis. The hospitalizations involved mainly men in the 7 th decade. The mean number of hospitalizations for Dupuytren's disease was 16, 487, for between 7 and 8 / 10, 000 total hospitalizations each year. Most of the hospitalizations for Dupuytren's disease were one-day stays in private settings. Over time, the mean length of hospital stay significantly shortened and the proportion of one-day stays significantly increased. Aponeurectomy was the most reported treatment. The distribution of aponeurectomy of 1 finger or ≥ 2 fingers was balanced. The performance of arthrolysis, transplantation, amputation and arthrodesis was low. ConclusionsDespite of shortening of hospitals stays over time, hospitalization for surgery for Dupuytren's disease in France still represents a meaningful economic burden.

40|$|Epimuscular myofascial force {{transmission}} (EMFT) {{is a major}} determinant of muscle force exerted, as well as length range of force exertion. Therefore, EMFT is of importance in remedial surgery performed, e. g., in spastic paresis. We aimed to test the following hypotheses: (1) muscle lengthening surgery (involving preparatory dissection (PD) and subsequent proximal <b>aponeurotomy</b> (AT)) affects the target muscle force exerted at its distal and proximal tendons differentially, (2) forces of non-operated synergistic muscles are affected as well, (3) PD causes some of these effects. In three conditions (control, post-PD, and post-AT exclusively on m. extensor digitorum longus (EDL)), forces exerted by rat anterior crural muscles were measured simultaneously. Our results confirm hypotheses (1 - 2), and hypothesis (3) in part: Reduction of EDL maximal force differed by location (i. e. 26. 3 % when tested distally and 44. 5 % when tested proximally). EDL length range of active force exertion increased only distally. Force reductions were shown also for non-operated tibialis anterior (by 11. 9 %), as well as for extensor hallucis longus (by 8. 4 %) muscles. In tibialis anterior only, part of the force reduction (4. 9 %) is attributable to PD. Due to EMFT, remedial surgery should be considered to have differential effects for targeted and non-targeted synergistic muscles. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Even {{though no}} direct {{physiologic}} evidence proving that myo-tendinous junctions {{at the end}} of myofibers are sites of force transmission is available, these locations are accepted to support this function, because its specialized morphology resembles that of load-bearing membranes in structure and location: Its design is fit for force transmission of force exerted by myofibers to tendinous fibrous material. Shearing of the interface between these structures is thought to be stronger than direct tensile transmission. On the basis of morphological studies of ‘in-series fibered muscle’ and biomechanical modeling it has been argued previously that force could also be transmitted laterally from the tapered ends of myofibers onto in series myofiber via the intramuscular connective tissue component. Shearing of the interfaces between myofibers is hypothesized to be the mechanisms of transmission. The interfaces are made up of basal membranes of both myofibers and their common endomysium. The issue of lateral force transmission from myofibers has not been addressed for whole muscle, in which myofibers are attached at both ends to tendinous aponeuroses, nor is any direct experimental evidence available about possible functional importance of this phenomenon in whole muscle. The primary objective of this presentation is to review available literature on myo-tendinous and myo-fascial force transmission, present evidence from experiments involving tenotomy, fasciatomy and <b>aponeurotomy</b> regarding its importance and consider implications for our thinking about muscle(s) and movement...|$|E
40|$|Background:. Although the {{efficacy}} of collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) injections has been demonstrated by randomized clinical trials, the relative effectiveness of CCH remains uncertain. Our aim was to compare the outcomes of CCH with those of percutaneous needle <b>aponeurotomy</b> (PNA) in daily clinical practice. Methods:. We analyzed data from patients undergoing PNA or CCH between 2011 and 2014 at 7 practice sites in the Netherlands. We examined the degree of improvement in contracture and adverse effects at 6 – 12 weeks after surgery or the last injection. Additionally, we invited patients to complete the Michigan Hand Questionnaire before and at 6 – 12 months follow-up. To {{minimize the risk of}} bias, we used propensity score matching. Results:. Among 130 matched patients (93 % Tubiana I or II) undergoing PNA (n = 46) and CCH (n = 84), improvement in contracture was similar: 26 degrees (65 % improvement from baseline) for PNA versus 31 degrees (71 %) for CCH for affected metacarpophalangeal joints (P = 0. 163). This was 16 degrees (50 % improvement) versus 17 degrees (42 %) for affected proximal interphalangeal joints (P = 0. 395), respectively. No serious adverse effects occurred in either of the 2 treatment groups. Of the mild adverse effects, only skin fissures and sensory disturbances were seen in both groups. Through 1 -year follow-up, patients reported similar improvements in the overall Michigan Hand Questionnaire score (PNA 5. 3 points versus CCH 4. 9 points; P = 0. 912). Conclusions:. In patients with mild contractures (Tubiana I or II), CCH was as effective as PNA in reducing contractures. Both treatments were safe and improved hand function to a similar extent in daily practice...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's {{disease of}} the hand is a common {{condition}} affecting the palmar fascia, resulting in progressive flexion deformities of the digits and hence limitation of hand function. The optimal treatment remains unclear as outcomes studies have {{used a variety of}} measures for assessment. METHODS: A literature search was performed for all publications describing surgical treatment, percutaneous needle <b>aponeurotomy</b> or collagenase injection for primary or recurrent Dupuytren's disease where outcomes had been monitored using functional measures. RESULTS: Ninety-one studies met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-two studies reported outcomes using patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) ranging from validated questionnaires to self-reported measures for return to work and self-rated disability. The Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score was the most utilised patient-reported function measure (n= 11). Patient satisfaction was reported by eighteen studies but no single method was used consistently. Range of movement was the most frequent physical measure and was reported in all 91 studies. However, the methods of measurement and reporting varied, with seventeen different techniques being used. Other physical measures included grip and pinch strength and sensibility, again with variations in measurement protocols. The mean follow-up time ranged from 2 weeks to 17 years. CONCLUSIONS: There is little consistency in the reporting of outcomes for interventions in patients with Dupuytren's disease, making it impossible to compare the efficacy of different treatment modalities. Although there are limitations to the existing generic patient reported outcomes measures, a combination of these together with a disease-specific questionnaire, and physical measures of active and passive individual joint Range of movement (ROM), grip and sensibility using standardised protocols should be used for future outcomes studies. As Dupuytren's disease tends to recur following treatment as well as extend to involve other areas of the hand, follow-up times should be standardised and designed to capture both short and long term outcomes...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite the {{prevalence}} of complex ventral hernias, there is little agreement on the most appropriate technique or prosthetic to repair these defects, especially in contaminated fields. Our objective was to determine French surgical practice patterns among academic surgeons in complex ventral hernia repair (CVHR) with regard to indications, most appropriate techniques, choice of prosthesis, and experience with complications. METHODS: A survey consisting of 21 questions and 6 case-scenarios was e-mailed to French practicing academic surgeons performing CVHR, representing all French University Hospitals. RESULTS: Forty over 54 surgeons (74 %) responded to the survey, representing 29 French University Hospitals. Regarding the techniques used for CVHR, primary closure without reinforcement was provided in 31. 6 % of cases, primary closure using the component separation technique without mesh use in 43. 7 % of cases, mesh positioned as a bridge in 16. 5 % of cases, size reduction of the defect by using <b>aponeurotomy</b> incisions without mesh use in 8. 2 % of cases. Among the 40 respondents, 36 had experience with biologic mesh. There was a strong consensus among surveyed surgeons for not using synthetic mesh in contaminated or dirty fields (100 %), but for using it in clean settings (100 %). There was also a strong consensus between respondents for using biologic mesh in contaminated (82. 5 %) or infected (77. 5 %) fields and for not using it in clean setting (95 %). In clean-contaminated surgery, there was no consensus for defining the optimal therapeutic strategy in CVHR. Infection {{was the most common}} complication reported after biologic mesh used (58 %). The most commonly reported influences for the use of biologic grafts included literature, conferences and discussion with colleagues (85. 0 %), personal experience (45. 0 %) and cost (40. 0 %). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a lack of level I evidence, biologic meshes are being used by 90 % of surveyed surgeons for CVHR. Importantly, there was a strong consensus for using them in contaminated or infected fields and for not using them in clean setting. To better guide surgeons, prospective, randomized trials should be undertaken to evaluate the short- and long-term outcomes associated with these materials in various surgical wound classifications...|$|E
40|$|Finite element {{modeling}} of aponeurotomized rat extensor digitorium longus muscle {{was performed to}} investigate the acute effects of proximal <b>aponeurotomy.</b> The specific goal {{was to assess the}} changes in lengths of sarcomeres within aponeurotomized muscle and to explain how the intervention leads to alterations in muscle length-force characteristics. Major changes in muscle length-active force characteristics were shown for the aponeurotomized muscle modeled with (1) only a discontinuity in the proximal aponeurosis and (2) with additional discontinuities of the muscles' extracellular matrix (i. e., when both myotendinous and myofascial force transmission mechanisms are interfered with). After muscle lengthening, two cut ends of the aponeurosis were separated by a gap. After intervention (1), only active slack length increased (by approximately 0. 9 mm) and limited reductions in muscle active force were found (e. g., muscle optimum force decreased by only 1 %) After intervention (2) active slack increased further (by 1. 2 mm) and optimum length as well (by 2. 0 mm) shifted and the range between these lengths increased. In addition, muscle active force was reduced substantially (e. g., muscle optimum force decreased by 21 %). The modeled tearing of the intramuscular connective tissue divides the muscle into a proximal and a distal population of muscle fibers. The altered force transmission was shown to lead to major sarcomere length distributions [not encountered in the intact muscle and after intervention (1) ], with contrasting effects for the two muscle fiber populations: (a) Within the distal population (i. e. fibers with no myotendinous connection to the muscles' origin), sarcomeres were much shorter than within the proximal population (fibers with intact myotendinous junction at both ends). (b) Within the distal population, from proximal ends of muscle fibers to distal ends, the serial distribution of sarcomere lengths ranged from the lowest length to high lengths. In contrast within the proximal population, the direction of the distribution was reversed. Such differences in distribution of sarcomere lengths between the proximal and distal fiber populations explain the shifts in muscle active slack and optimal lengths. Muscle force reduction after intervention (2) is explained primarily by the short sarcomeres within the distal population. However, fiber stress distributions showed contribution {{of the majority of the}} sarcomeres to muscle force: myofascial force transmission prevents the sarcomeres from shortening to nonphysiological lengths. It is concluded that interfering with the intramuscular myofascial force transmission due to rupturing of the intramuscular connective tissue leads to a complex distribution of sarcomere lengths within the aponeurotomized muscle and this determines the acute effects of the intervention on muscle length-force characteristics rather than the intervention with the myotendinous force transmission after which the intervention was named. These results suggest that during surgery, but also postoperatively, major attention should be focused on the length and activity of aponeurotomized muscle, as changes in connective tissue tear depth will affect the acute effects of the intervention. © Springer-Verlag 2007...|$|E
