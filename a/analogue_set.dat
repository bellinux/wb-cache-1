The entire Cork analogue cable network was encrypted from late 1980s onwards. The Cork network also carried more channels than other cable networks in Ireland at that time. When digital cable was launched in Cork, UPC Ireland rapidly swapped <b>analogue</b> <b>set</b> top boxes for digital boxes and then shutdown the analogue service entirely. The network still carries analogue terrestrial channels, RTÉ1, RTÉ2, TV3 and TG4 {{in some parts of}} the network. This means that Cork is the first city in Ireland with an exclusively digital cable network. For analogue cable in Ireland there is no set frequency plan. Most cable networks for analogue use Harmonically related carriers (carrier frequencies of exact 8 MHz multiples). Some cable networks such as Limerick use Irish terrestrial channel alignments or even a mixture of the two-channel plans.|$|E

The {{concepts}} of Boolean metric space and convex combination {{are used to}} characterize polynomial maps A n − → A m {{in a class of}} commutative Von Neumann regular rings including p-rings, that we have called CFG-rings. In those rings, the study of the category of algebraic varieties (i. e. sets of solutions to a finite number of polynomial equations with polynomial maps as morphisms) is equivalent to the study of a class of Boolean metric spaces, that we call here CFG-spaces.

We conducted an experiment comparing a fully analogue to a semi-virtual DT workshop with overall 59 participants from 27 different countries and 11 different disciplines separated into an experimental- and control group. For the evaluation, we composed items from the psychological construct of Shared Mental Models (SMM) and discussed existing Media Theories in order to draw conclusions {{on the impact of}} performing DT semi-virtually in regard to using a digital whiteboard. Against our expectations and assumptions from theory, we reveal that a semi-virtual DT workshop can lead to high levels of shared understanding, satisfaction and perceived effectiveness. We argue that the applied digital whiteboard supports a creative semi-virtual collaboration due to its advanced functionalities, which supports the Media Richness Theory...|$|R
40|$|Reported {{biological}} {{activities of}} Stemona natural products, such as antitussive activity, inspired {{the development of}} synthetic methods to access several alkaloids within this family {{and in so doing}} develop a general route to the core skeleta shared by the class of natural products. The chemistry was subsequently adapted to afford a series of <b>analogue</b> <b>sets</b> bearing simplified, diverse Stemona-inspired skeleta. Over 100 of these analogues were subjected to general G protein-coupled receptor profiling along with the known antitussive compound, neostenine; this led to the identification of hit compounds targeting several receptor types. The particularly rich hit subset for sigma receptors was expanded with two focused library sets, which resulted in the discovery of a fully synthetic, potent chemotype of sigma ligands. This collaborative effort combined the development of synthetic methods with extensive, flexible screening resources and exemplifies the role of natural products in bioactivity mining...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} used {{functional}} analyses to prescribe interventions for severe behavior disorders. The {{majority of these}} {{studies have focused on}} behavior that is clearly maintained by socially mediated reinforcement, such as contingent access to attention, tangibles, or escape from instructional demands. However, a significant proportion of functional analyses do not yield conclusive results. We examined interventions for 3 children with severe disabilities following inconclusive functional analyses. First, preferred stimuli were identified for each child via a stimulus preference assessment. Second, a functional analysis was conducted for 2 of the 3 children. High rates of aberrant behavior were seen even (if not especially) in no-interaction sessions. The 3 rd child was observed for several consecutive no-interaction sessions; behavior persisted in this condition. Third, interventions based on environmental enrichment were analyzed in an <b>analogue</b> <b>setting.</b> For all of the children, environmental enrichment decreased aberrant behavior if preferred stimuli were used in the procedure. To obtain further reductions in aberrant behavior, explicit reinforcement of toy play was required for 2 children, and a brief (5 -s) time-out was necessary with 1 child. Finally, effects of treatment carried over to the school or home environment following teacher or family training. Results are discussed in the context of basic reinforcement principles and future directions for research...|$|R
40|$|Coarse {{crystalline}} cryogenic cave carbonates (CCC coarse) {{dated to}} the last glacial period are common in central European caves and provide convincing evidence of palaeo-permafrost during this time. Little is known, however, about {{the exact nature of}} the environment in which CCC coarse formed as no modern <b>analogue</b> <b>setting</b> is known. Here, we report the first findings of sub-recent, albeit inactive, CCC coarse from a cave of the Western Alps which is located in the present-day permafrost zone. The globular shape and the presence of ubiquitous euhedral crystal terminations are comparable to previously reported aggregates from the last glacial period and strongly suggest that these aggregates formed subaqueously in pools lacking agitation. Furthermore, stable isotope values of mm-sized spheroids point to calcite precipitation in a closed system with respect to CO 2, strongly supporting the hypothesis of a cryogenic origin associated with the freezing of water ponds. U-series analyses revealed three clusters of late Holocene calcite precipitation intervals between 2129 and 751 a b 2 k. These ages correlate with known periods of elevated summer temperatures, suggesting that warming and thawing of the frozen catchment above the cave allowed water infiltration into the karst system. The growth of CCC coarse resulted from the re-freezing of this water in the still cold karst cavities...|$|R

40|$|Many {{volcanic}} edifices {{are subject}} to sector collapse. Analogue models are here used to better understand specific modes of collapse. Four sets of experiments have been performed with a cone (volcano analogue) of dry sand (87 % in volume) and flour (13 %) simulating collapse through: A) basal failure, due to the horizontal sliding of a basal plate; B) unbuttressing, due to the horizontal movement of a lateral wall; C) summit growth, due to the addition of sand and flour {{on the top of}} the cone; D) injection, due to the intrusion of silicone (magma <b>analogue).</b> <b>Sets</b> A and B show common results, highlighting the influence of topography on the dip and strike of the collapse surfaces. In set C, the location and direction of collapse are controlled by the cone shape and occurrence of pre-existing collapses. In set D, if the silicone is injected eccentrically, it induces collapse on the nearest slope; this process leads to repeated collapse on the side of a pre-existing scarp, possibly triggering a feedback mechanism between magmatic activity and topography. In general, sets A and B induce deeper and wider collapse, whereas shallower and narrower collapse is observed in set C; set D shows intermediate geometries. Comparison with natural examples shows an overall similar distribution in the geometry of the sector collapses and their known triggering mechanisms. Similarities and discrepancies between each experimental set and corresponding cases in nature are discussed...|$|R
