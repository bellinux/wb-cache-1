25|$|You {{are asking}} me to „voluntarily {{surrender}} the fortress; otherwise you will be corrected in front of God and humanity“. What a beautiful and humane sentence? Do you believe in God? I doubt that you believe in Him and that love humanity, if you would, then you wouldn't lead his unfortunate soldiers right here to a senseless slaughter, and to certain death, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> spared them, their wives and children, and made them to live quietly at home instead of having led them such a distance because of the pernicious whims of your king.|$|E
500|$|Hughes {{said that}} he had Broderick in mind when he wrote the screenplay, saying Broderick was the only actor he could think of who could pull off the role, calling him clever and charming. [...] "Certain guys would have played Ferris <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> thought, 'Where's my wallet?'" [...] Hughes said. [...] "I had to have that look; that charm had to come through. Jimmy Stewart could have played Ferris at 15...I needed Matthew." [...] Other actors who were {{considered}} for the role included Jim Carrey, John Cusack, Tom Cruise and Michael J. Fox.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Book of Exodus, God {{hardened}} Pharaoh's heart so {{he would}} {{be strong enough to}} persist in his unwillingness to release the people, so that God could manifest his great power and cause his power to be declared among the nations, so that other people would discuss it for generations afterward. In this view, the plagues were punishment for the Egyptians' long abuse of the Israelites, as well as proof that the gods of Egypt were false and powerless. If God triumphed over the gods of Egypt, a world power at that time, then the people of God would be strengthened in their faith, although they were a small people, and would not be tempted to follow the deities that God proved false. Exodus 9:15–16 (JPS Tanakh) portrays Yahweh explaining why he did not accomplish the freedom of the Israelites immediately: [...] "I could have stretched forth My hand and stricken you [...] and your people with pestilence, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been effaced from the earth. Nevertheless I have spared you for this purpose: in order to show you My power and in order that My fame may resound throughout the world." ...|$|E
60|$|THE SHE-ANCIENT. That {{is where}} you are wrong, my child. If those two loathsome things had been rag dolls, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been amusing and lovable. The Newly Born here <b>would</b> <b>have</b> played with them; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> all <b>have</b> laughed <b>and</b> played with them too until you had torn them to pieces; <b>and</b> then <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> laughed more than ever.|$|R
60|$|GEOFFREY I know, dear. I was afraid. It mightn't {{have come}} off. <b>And</b> then <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been so disappointed.|$|R

6000|$|... "How is your side?" [...] {{asked the}} captain. [...] "Your escape was most wonderful. Another foot farther, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been drowned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Had <b>you</b> {{been true}} <b>and</b> honest <b>and</b> upright, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> known {{that as long}} as there was a doubt she ought to have been away from you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay," [...] {{said another}} collier; [...] "ask {{for the young}} queen's picture, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> soon <b>have</b> to put your shirt on, and go up the shaft." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "----useless to me, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> {{that which}} is without value to the giver. Oh! I string words ill, {{but they were not}} what I meant." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, {{it would}} be well I am sure, because you have ample means, and the house is large; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> his wife to love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye! <b>And</b> <b>you</b> just <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had {{to stand}} and see them go," [...] said Captain MacWhirr, showing a certain animation. [...] "It's a dead calm, isn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Say {{she had a}} nasty fall, {{which makes}} it {{undesirable}} to move her just yet. It is the simple truth, <b>and</b> what <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> naturally said but for this little communication of mine.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Considering his venerable age," [...] said he, [...] "and {{his past}} greatness and renown as a prince <b>and</b> commander, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done {{much better to}} have acted as his guards than as his executioners." ...|$|R

6000|$|Deringham {{appeared}} a trifle embarrassed. [...] "I'm {{not sure that}} you are indebted to me at all," [...] he said. [...] "I only seized his shoulder, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> expected me to look on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{sure if it}} hadn't {{been for}} me he <b>would</b> never <b>have</b> come to the house, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> never <b>have</b> known {{what he thought of}} you," [...] Mrs. Penniman rejoined, with a good deal of justice.|$|R

6000|$|... "If I did," [...] {{said the}} Duke {{in a low}} voice, [...] "you <b>and</b> all <b>you</b> believe, <b>and</b> all by which alone <b>you</b> live, <b>would</b> {{be the first to}} shrivel <b>and</b> perish. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> an instant to know the great Nothing before you died." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Truly, a {{neat and}} {{pleasant}} dwelling! <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> no objection, I guess, {{to give a}} handsome young gentleman some little sop of something just to remind him, you know, that it isn't dinner-time." ...|$|E
