40|$|This article {{deals with}} a Hub Location Problem arising in Telecommunication Network Design. The {{considered}} network presents two different kinds of nodes: <b>access</b> <b>nodes,</b> that represent source and destination of traffic demands but cannot be directly connected, and transit nodes, that have no own traffic demand but collect traffic from <b>access</b> <b>nodes</b> and route it through the network. Transit nodes {{are supposed to be}} fully connected. Given a set of <b>access</b> <b>nodes</b> and a set of potential locations for the transit nodes, the problem is to decide number and positions of the transit nodes to guarantee that all <b>access</b> <b>nodes</b> are allocated to a transit node, satisfying capacity constraints. The goal is to minimize the total cost of the network, which is the sum of connection costs and nodes fixed costs. The problem is a Hub Location Problem, which is known to be NP-hard. A local search approach is proposed, and different metaheuristic algorithms, such as tabu search, iterated local search and random multistart, have been developed, based on such local search. [A preliminary procedure has been developed in a research project joint with Telecom Italia (Turin Research & Innovation Laboratories) and a patent application has been filed to cover this issue. ...|$|R

50|$|First, {{we define}} for each node its {{preferred}} child, which informally is the most-recently touched child by a traditional {{binary search tree}} lookup. More formally, consider a subtree T, rooted at p, with children l (left) and r (right). We set r as the preferred child of p if the most recently <b>accessed</b> <b>node</b> in T is in the subtree rooted at r, and l as the preferred child otherwise.

50|$|This {{technique}} involves swapping an <b>accessed</b> <b>node</b> {{with its}} predecessor. Therefore, if any <b>node</b> is <b>accessed,</b> it is swapped with the node in front {{unless it is}} the head node, thereby increasing its priority. This algorithm is again easy to implement and space efficient and {{is more likely to}} keep frequently <b>accessed</b> <b>nodes</b> {{at the front of the}} list. However, the transpose method is more cautious. i.e. it will take many accesses to move the element to the head of the list. This method also does not allow for rapid response to changes in the query distributions on the nodes in the list.|$|R

30|$|A multi-commodity flow {{approach}} was adopted in[16] {{to maximize the}} number of virtual networks that could be accommodated on a single substrate network. The substrate has <b>access</b> <b>nodes,</b> which serve as sources and destinations for all traffic, and the core nodes {{are responsible for the}} routing of packets. A request for virtual network establishment consists of a list of <b>access</b> <b>nodes</b> of the substrate, as well as of a traffic matrix that represents the amount of traffic transferred between the <b>access</b> <b>nodes</b> listed. Although network capacity is considered, the processing capacity of the nodes is ignored. Furthermore, this approach assumes that the demands of a request are small compared to the available capacity of the network. Unlike[16], algorithms proposed here take into consideration various other characteristics, and no restrictions are imposed on the demands of virtual networks. Another difference is that the algorithm in[16] considers only the edge nodes of the virtual network. The algorithm in[7] is similar to that in[16], except that it is uses a mixed integer quadratic problems branch and bound approach[17] to map the requests.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe problem {{studied in}} this paper {{consists}} of two parts, a burst mode study and a packet scheduling algorithm applied to <b>access</b> <b>nodes</b> in a multiservice optical packet-switched network. The burst mode study aims {{to show how the}} performance of intermediate nodes is afected by the way in which packets are grouped or sequenced at the <b>access</b> <b>nodes</b> of the network.

Existing packet scheduling algorithms are typically designed to support delaysensitive applications in a high speed networking environment. In this work we present a new packet scheduling algorithm (so-called RMPS for Rate Monotonic Packet Scheduling) that reduces resource contentions at the core nodes of the network. Our algorithm is derived from RMS (Rate Monotonic Scheduling) algorithm which is designed at the origin for "process scheduling" in the kernel of operating systems. We use simulations to evaluate the performance of the network when using the proposed packet scheduling mechanis...|$|R

30|$|The {{efficiency}} of all CoMP schemes {{rely heavily on}} {{the properties of the}} control channels.
