5|$|By October 1914, many Ghadarites had {{returned}} to India and were assigned tasks like contacting Indian revolutionaries and organisations, spreading propaganda and literature, and arranging to get arms into the country. The first group of 60 Ghadarites led by Jawala Singh, left San Francisco for Canton aboard the steamship Korea on 29 August. They were to sail on to India, {{where they would be}} provided with arms to organise a revolt. At Canton, more Indians joined, and the group, now numbering about 150, sailed for Calcutta on a Japanese vessel. They were to be joined by more Ghadarites arriving in smaller groups. During September and October, about 300 Indians left for India in various ships like SS Siberia, Chinyo Maru, China, Manchuria, SS Tenyo Maru, SS Mongolia and SS Shinyo Maru. Although the Koreas party itself was uncovered and arrested on arrival at Calcutta, a successful underground network was established between the United States and India, through Shanghai, Swatow, and Siam. Tehl Singh, the Ghadar operative in Shanghai, is believed to have spent $30,000 for helping the revolutionaries to get into India. The Ghadarites in India were able to establish contact with sympathisers within the British Indian Army as well <b>as</b> <b>build</b> networks with underground revolutionary groups.|$|E

Players have the option to customize their weapons and vehicles, as well <b>as</b> <b>build</b> a wide assortment of items using collected recipes. Not only can the vehicles be used for racing, but, like all open-world sandbox games, they can be used for traveling from one location to the other with occasional attacks from enemy vehicles. There are also side missions and a number of other minor exploratory elements.|$|E
25|$|The Fort Belknap Indian Reservation {{was created}} in 1888 in Montana. It was created from {{what had once been}} a much larger area of land to be set aside for tribes. The 1888 {{agreement}} neglected to mention any water rights that were reserved for the reservation in relation to the Milk River. Soon there came a huge demand for water by non-Indian settlers which was an issue for the Fort Belknap American Indian reservation. As non-Indian settlers began moving closer to the Fort Belknap Reservation, the settlers claimed rights to the water. The settlers did things such <b>as</b> <b>build</b> dams and reservoirs which prevented the reservation from receiving water needed for agricultural purposes. The settlers used the terms of the Appropriative water system to support their actions claiming that they had appropriated the water before the American Indians living on the reservation had put the water to beneficial use.|$|E

25|$|In 1888, {{the young}} and ambitious Kaiser Wilhelm II became emperor. He could not abide advice, least of all from the most {{experienced}} politician and diplomat in Europe, so he fired Bismarck. The Kaiser opposed Bismarck's careful foreign policy and wanted Germany to pursue colonialist policies, as Britain and France had been doing for decades, as well <b>as</b> <b>build</b> a navy that could match the British. The Kaiser promoted active colonization of Africa and Asia for those areas that were not already colonies of other European powers; his record was notoriously brutal {{and set the stage}} for genocide. The Kaiser took a mostly unilateral approach in Europe with as main ally the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and an arms race with Britain, which eventually led to the situation in which the assassination of the Austrian-Hungarian crown prince could spark off World War I.|$|E
500|$|The {{composition}} of the molten rock (magma) that feeds volcanism in the Lassen volcanic area ranges widely in its content of silica or the higher the silica content, the greater {{the ability of the}} magma to trap and hold on to gas and water vapor. When high-silica (dacitic) magma rises to the Earth's surface, the trapped gases and vapors can erupt explosively to produce ash clouds and pyroclastic flows that consist of superheated gas, ash and volcanic fragments. Dacite magma that is extruded nonexplosively as lava forms lava domes because it is too viscous (sticky) to flow far away from its source. Low-silica (basaltic) magma is more fluid and usually erupts as lava in less explosive eruptions than dacite because gas and water vapor escape easily from it. Eruptions of basalt magma typically produce elongate lava flows, as well <b>as</b> <b>build</b> cinder cones (piles of small frothy lava fragments or 'cinders') around volcanic vents.|$|E

Successive {{internal}} builds over several months gradually integrated a lot of the fundamental work that had been done over the previous three years, but with much stricter rules about what code could be brought into the main builds. Builds in this period of time were described variously as Longhorn [...] "D1", [...] and as Milestone 8 / 9, depending on whether the new or old build tree was being worked on.

2500|$|Manhattan Valley has gentrified {{significantly}} {{since the}} 1980s. With this gentrification, rents {{in the area}} rose. The population of estimated Latino residents was fast dwindling by 1987. Meanwhile, nonprofit groups started to renovate many structures that were owned by the city, as well <b>as</b> <b>build</b> housing on previously vacant tracts of land. Reactions to this gentrification were mixed. In 1990, one resident stated, [...] "The crime situation is our biggest threat [...] but if {{we get rid of}} it, we're also faced with gentrification." [...] Coinciding with this gentrification in 1990, crime was declining steeply, although drug dealings were still common; one large drug arrest had been made in December of that year. The Frederick Douglass Houses, which had become frequented by drug dealers, was thought to be stymieing the development of new housing in the area, which included two apartment towers that had been constructed in the preceding two years.|$|E

2500|$|It was Vesey's {{respected}} {{position within}} the church and his friendship with the King that set about {{the start of a}} revival for Sutton Coldfield, spearheaded by Vesey. He had returned to the town in 1524 for the funeral of his mother to discover the town had further deteriorated. He decided to set up residence in the town again and in 1527 obtained two enclosures of land named Moor Yards and Heath Crofts, as well as [...] of land for him to construct his own home named Moor Hall. In the same year, he established a grammar school in the southwest corner of the parish churchyard, where 21 people were appointed Trustees to maintain the building and employ a teacher. On 16 December 1528, through the interests of Vesey, Henry VIII granted Sutton Coldfield a Charter of Incorporation, creating a new form of government for the town which was named the Warden and Society of the Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield. The society consisted of 25 of the most prominent local inhabitants who elected a new Warden from within them. Vesey's brother-in-law, William Gibbons, became the first Warden. All the town's inhabitants over the age of 22 were permitted to elect members to the Society. The charter had also given the inhabitants permission to hunt and fish freely in the manor grounds, as well <b>as</b> <b>build</b> a house, enclosing up to , within the manor grounds.

2500|$|Until 1997, {{contacts}} between tourists and Cubans were de facto outlawed by the Communist regime. Following {{the collapse of}} Cuba's chief trading partner the Soviet Union, and the resulting economic crisis known as the Special Period, Cuba's government embarked on a major program to restore old hotels, remaining old pre-communism American cars, and restore several Havana streets to their former glory, as well <b>as</b> <b>build</b> beach resorts to bolster the tourist industry {{in order to bring}} in much needed finance to the island. To ensure the isolation of international tourism from the state isolated Cuban society, it was to be promoted in enclave resorts where, as much as possible, tourists would be segregated from Cuban society, known to as [...] "enclave tourism" [...] and [...] "tourism apartheid". By the late 1990s, tourism surpassed Cuba's traditional export industry, sugar, as the nation's leading source of revenue. Visitors come primarily from Canada and western Europe and tourist areas are highly concentrated around Varadero, Cayo Coco, the beach areas north of Holguin, and Havana. The impact on Cuba's socialist society and economy has been significant. However, in recent years Cuba's tourism has decreased due to the economic recession, escalating foreign investment conflicts and fears, and internal economic restrictions. Since its reopening to tourism in the mid-1990s Cuba has not met the projected growth, has had relatively little restoration, and slow growth. A lack of foreign investment has also had a negative effect. Since then, the Dominican Republic has surpassed Cuba in tourism, new development, and investment.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2008, NFL draft expert Mel Kiper Jr. named Ringer as {{the best}} back {{in the class of}} 2009.

Ringer has said he has worked out at the combine with his knee at [...] "80%". Ringer skipped the 2009 Senior Bowl because of his injury. Despite the injury, Ringer chose to participate in the 40-yard dash at the NFL combine. He clocked in at 4.59. Ringer was quoted as saying [...] "I personally was disappointed because I know I'm a lot faster than that. But I was able to do that just coming off knee surgery, so if I look at it that way, I'm happy." [...] He finished third among running backs in the 20-yard shuttle (4.11 seconds) and fifth in the three-cone drill (6.87 seconds). During the combine, Ringer said he interviewed with 12 teams. ESPN.com ranked him as the 8th best running back in the draft. When Scouts Inc. graded Ringer, they gave him a 1 (Exceptional) in Character. They said of Ringer, [...] "No off-the-field issues we are aware of. Coaches and teammates have only positive things to say about him. Outstanding intangibles."
