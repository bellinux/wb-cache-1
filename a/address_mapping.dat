50|$|In general, NAT64 is {{designed}} to be used when the communication is initiated by IPv6 hosts. Some mechanisms, including static <b>address</b> <b>mapping,</b> exist to allow the inverse scenario.|$|E
50|$|An iconic {{example of}} virtual-to-physical address {{translation}} is virtual memory, where different pages of virtual <b>address</b> space <b>map</b> either to page file or to main memory physical address space. It {{is possible that}} several numerically different virtual addresses all refer to one physical address and hence to the same physical byte of RAM. It {{is also possible that}} a single virtual <b>address</b> <b>maps</b> to zero, one, or more than one physical address.|$|R
50|$|The Power ISA v3.0 allows 64 bits for an {{effective}} <b>address,</b> <b>mapped</b> to a segmented address with between 65 and 78 bits allowed, for virtual memory, and, {{for any given}} processor, up to 60 bits for physical memory.|$|R

50|$|A simple NAT64 {{installation}} may {{consist of}} a gateway with two interfaces connected to an IPv4 network and an IPv6 network, respectively. Traffic from the IPv6 network is routed via the gateway which performs all the necessary translations for transferring packets between the two networks. However, the translation is not symmetric, as the IPv6 address space is {{much larger than the}} IPv4 address space; thus, one-to-one <b>address</b> <b>mapping</b> is not possible. The gateway maintains IPv6-to-IPv4 <b>address</b> <b>mapping,</b> which may be established manually (stateless mapping) or automatically (stateful mapping) when the first packet from the IPv6 network reaches the NAT64 gateway.|$|E

Quark also has an asynchronous/synchronous message interface similar to Amiga's Exec kernel but adapted to the memory protected environment.|$|E
50|$|Simple QIOs, such as read {{or write}} requests, are either {{serviced}} by the kernel itself or by device drivers. Certain more complicated requests, specifically those involving tape drives and file-level operations, were originally executed by an Ancillary Control Processor (ACP) (a special purpose task with its own <b>address</b> <b>mapping).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The first [...] "4rd" [...] specification, {{unlike the}} current one of RFC 7600, used IPv4 {{encapsulation}} in IPv6 packets, the only known tunneling approach {{at that time to}} ensure complete IPv4 preservation across IPv6-only domains.

40|$|A {{virtual address}} cache memory, whose {{operation}} is controlled explicitly by software, is presented. Ad-hoc hardware mechanisms, including new machine instructions {{and a new}} operand addressing mode, reduce the complexity of cache management logic in favour of {{the capacity of the}} cache, and solve the major problem of virtual address cache organization: two or more virtual <b>addresses</b> <b>mapping</b> into the same real address...|$|R
50|$|This {{implies that}} after the {{hardware}} reset, the CPU will start execution at the physical address 0xFFFF0. In IBM PC compatible computers, This <b>address</b> <b>maps</b> to BIOS ROM. The memory word at 0xFFFF0 usually contains a JMP instruction that redirects the CPU to execute the initialization code of BIOS. This JMP instruction is absolutely the first instruction executed after the reset.|$|R
50|$|The PCD also {{provides}} a lot of useful debug information that can help the developers and the test engineers to understand what happened.

50|$|Dynamic NAT, {{just like}} static NAT, is not common in smaller {{networks}} but is found within larger corporations with complex networks. The way dynamic NAT differs from static NAT {{is that where}} static NAT provides a one-to-one internal to public static IP <b>address</b> <b>mapping,</b> dynamic NAT doesn't make the mapping to the public IP address static and usually uses a group of available public IP addresses.|$|E
50|$|A {{reference}} {{can be used}} {{to refer}} to an object with a specific identity. A reference contains the information that is necessary for the identity property to be realized in the programming language, and allows access to the object with the identity. A type of a target of a reference is a role. Typically, references are isomorphic to memory addresses. However, multiple such references can refer to the same object, if some form of <b>address</b> <b>mapping</b> is present (virtual addresses / page tables / memory segments).|$|E

In some areas sirens are still in use, sometimes even as the primary means of alerting firefighters.|$|R
40|$|Image {{compression}} {{methods for}} progressive transmission using optimal hierarchical decomposition, partition priority coding (PPC) and multiple distribution entropy coding (MDEC) are presented. In the proposed coder, a hierarchical subband/wavelet decomposition transforms the original image. The analysis lter banks are selected {{to maximize the}} reproduction delity ineachstage of progressive image transmission. An e cient triple state DPCM method {{is applied to the}} smoothed subband coe cients and the corresponding prediction error is Lloyd-Max quantized. Such aquantizer is also designed to t the characteristics of the detail transform coe cients in each subband, which are then coded using novel hierarchical PPC (HPPC) and predictive HPPC (PHPPC) algorithms. More speci-cally, given a suitable partitioning of their absolute range, the quantized detail coe cients are ordered based on both their decomposition level and partition and, then, are coded along with the corresponding <b>address</b> <b>map.</b> Space lling scanning further reduces the coding cost by providing a highly spatially correlated <b>address</b> <b>map</b> of the coe cients in each PPC partition. Finally, adaptive MDEC is applied to both the DPCM and HPPC/PHPPC output...|$|R

The scope {{of this paper is}} to present the synthesizer, its additive and spectral envelope control units, and the morphing they allow for. ...|$|R
50|$|The OP API is {{designed}} for controlling, connecting, and observing platforms. This API can be called from C, C++, or SystemC. The platform provides {{the basic structure of}} the design and creates, connects, and configures the components. The platform also specifies the <b>address</b> <b>mapping,</b> and software that is loaded on the processors. It is very easy with OP to specify very complex and complete platforms of many different processors, local and shared memories, caches, bus bridges, peripherals and all their complex address maps, interrupts and operating systems and application software.|$|E
50|$|In a data model, {{a virtual}} {{representation}} of each device is {{constructed in the}} SCADA software. These virtual representations (“models”) can contain not just the <b>address</b> <b>mapping</b> of the device represented, but also any other pertinent information (web based info, database entries, media files, etc.) {{that may be used}} by other facets of the SCADA/IoT implementation. As the increased complexity of the Internet of things renders traditional SCADA increasingly “house-bound,” and as communication protocols evolve to favor platform-independent, service-oriented architecture (such as OPC UA), it is likely that more SCADA software developers will implement some form of data modeling.|$|E
50|$|While {{malicious}} domain-name resolution {{can result}} from compromises in {{the large numbers of}} trusted nodes that participate in a name lookup, the most vulnerable points of compromise are near the leaves of the Internet. For instance, incorrect entries in a desktop computer's hosts file, which circumvents name lookup with its own local name to IP <b>address</b> <b>mapping,</b> is a popular target for malware. Once rewritten, a legitimate request for a sensitive website can direct the user to a fraudulent copy. Desktops are often better targets for pharming because they receive poorer administration than most Internet servers.|$|E
50|$|In computing, a ping sweep is {{a method}} that can {{establish}} a range of IP <b>addresses</b> which <b>map</b> to live hosts.|$|R
30|$|Maintaining {{different}} design representations is error-prone [22] when different teams work {{in parallel}} on different {{representations of the}} same block. To overcome this draw-back, the same person is typically in charge of maintaining all representations of a single block. On the system-level, automatic conversion scripts are employed to maintain important parameters such as data-types, word-lengths, and register <b>address</b> <b>maps</b> in a single database (Figure 2). This measure together with regular simulation runs helps to ensure consistency across different design representations.|$|R
50|$|While {{the basic}} concept was effective, the Penet remailer had several {{vulnerabilities}} which threatened {{the anonymity of}} its users. Chief among them was the need to store a list of real e-mail <b>addresses</b> <b>mapped</b> to the corresponding anonymous e-mail addresses on the server. A potential attacker needed only to access that list to compromise the identities of all of Penet’s users. The Penet remailer was on two occasions required by the legal system in Finland (the country where the Penet server hardware resided) {{to turn over the}} real e-mail <b>address</b> that was <b>mapped</b> to an anonymous e-mail address. Another potential vulnerability was that messages sent to and from the remailer were all sent in cleartext, making it vulnerable to electronic eavesdropping.|$|R
