Chuck D later said of the album in retrospect, [...] "If It Takes a Nation was our 'nation' record, Fear of a Black Planet was our 'world' record". With respect to hip hop, the album was important in the field of sampling, as copyright lawyers took notice of The Bomb Squad's production and such a sample-heavy work would not be cost effective in the future. Chuck D later said of its sampling issues, [...] "We got sued for everything. We knew that the door on sampling was gonna close". Subsequent use of sampled material, particularly the use of whole songs on top of a beat, by other hip hop artists prompted stricter sampling laws. Fear of a Black Planet was the group's commercial apex, with sales dropping off for their subsequent albums.

A two-part series Chuck Philips wrote for the Los Angeles Times in 2002, [...] "Who Killed Tupac Shakur?", based on police reports and multiple sources reported that [...] "the shooting {{was carried out by}} a Compton gang called the Southside Crips to avenge the beating of one of its members by Shakur a few hours earlier" [...] and that Wallace paid for the gun. His family publicly denied the report, producing documents purporting to show that the rapper was in New York and New Jersey at the time. The New York Times called the documents inconclusive, stating: The pages purport to be three computer printouts from Daddy's House, indicating that Wallace was in the studio recording a song called Nasty Boy on the night Shakur was shot. They indicate that Wallace wrote half the session, was In and out/sat around and laid down a ref, shorthand for a reference vocal, the equivalent of a first take.

And Louis Alfred, the recording engineer listed on the sheets, {{said in an interview that}} he remembered recording the song with Wallace in a late-night session, not during the day. He could not recall the date of the session but said it was likely not the night Shakur was shot. We would have heard about it, Mr. Alfred said." [...] Moreover, Philips' article was based on multiple sources. As the Assistant Managing Editor of the LA Times Mark Duvoisin wrote: [...] "Philips' story has withstood all challenges to its accuracy, ... remains the definitive account of the Shakur slaying." [...] Faith Evans remembered her husband calling her the night of Shakur's death and crying due to him being in shock. Evans added, [...] "I think it’s fair to say he was probably afraid, given everything that was going on at that time and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>hype</b> that was put on this so-called beef that he didn’t really have in his heart against anyone."
