40|$|The aim of {{my project}} is to {{optimize}} the level of Polyphenol content present in Green Tea at various temperatures. During the project various combinations of temperatures and time intervals were used to obtain the Green Tea extract and the polyphenol content of all these extracts were estimated. Both unfermented and <b>artificial</b> <b>fermentation</b> condtions were used to obtain the extract. The extracts were further used to screen the various contents of the extract both normally and after purifying the sample with PVP (Polyvinyl pyrrlidone). The extract with the highest content of polyphenols were further used to estimate the antioxidant property after purification with column chromatograph...|$|E
40|$|Mentor: Ulrike TschirnerAcetic {{groups have}} been known to reduce the {{production}} of ethanol during fermentation. Various chemical treatments were conducted on an <b>artificial</b> <b>fermentation</b> liquor in an attempt {{to reduce the amount of}} acetic groups in the solution. These treatments included calcium hydroxide and zeolites (aluminum and silicon structures). It was found that a zeolite with a silicon to aluminum ratio of 140 removed the most acetic groups (12. 52 %) and a zeolite with a silicon to aluminum ratio of 29 removed less (11. 33 %). However, the zeolite with the silicon to aluminum ratio of 29 managed to have a higher conversion of dextrose to ethanol than the zeolite with a silicon to aluminum ratio of 140...|$|E

40|$|Background: Propionic acid is {{a widely}} used {{preservative}} and has been mainly formed by <b>artificial</b> synthesis or <b>fermentation.</b> In the case of natural products, the presence of propionic acid {{is viewed as a}} sign that an additive has been introduced for antimicrobial effects. Methods: In this work, the propionic acid that occurs in Scutellaria baicalensis roots was studied. A quantification method was developed, validated, and showed good linearity, low limit of detection, and limit of quantification values, as well as fine precision and recovery rate. The developed method was applied to the analysis of S. baicalensis roots collected in South Korea and China. Results: The detection rate for all samples was 94. 0 %. The average concentration was 0. 41  ±  0. 24  mg/g from the China sample and 0. 76  ±  0. 28  mg/g from the Korea sample. Conclusion: This study is the first to report that propionic acid exists in S. baicalensis roots and also provides a useful ultra performance liquid chromatography analysis method for its quantification...|$|R
40|$|Artificial neural {{networks}} (ANN) and response surface methodology (RSM) {{were used to}} build a model to describe the effects of four independent variables (moisture content, concentrations of glucose, ammonium nitrate and methionine) on the yield of cephalosporin C (CPC) from Acremonium chrysogenum under solid state fermentation. The respective uses of RSM and ANN {{were found to be}} effective in locating the optimum conditions within the range fixed from the preliminary runs. When compared with the predictions given by RSM, ANN was found to be superior in describing the fermentation process for the production of CPC. When a global optimization routine was employed to optimize the equation resulted from the {{neural networks}}, the optimum predicted antibiotic yield was found to be 29. 4 mg/g which is 14. 8 % higher than the optimum value obtained from preliminary runs, and 9. 2 % higher than value obtained from Box-Behnken design of RSM.
