40|$|The venting of {{anthropogenic}} CO₂ emissions {{into the}} atmosphere at increasing rates is probably influencing global warming and climate change. The Tangguh LNG development project in Papua, Indonesia will produce significant volumes of CO₂, which might be vented {{into the atmosphere}}. The LNG process will necessitate the separation of CO₂, estimated at 2. 4 trillion cubic feet (TCF sc), from the natural gas reserves prior to liquefaction and shipping. This study screens and assesses the possible alternatives to <b>atmospheric</b> <b>venting,</b> and recommends subsurface CO₂ injection and sequestration/storage in saline aquifers. The study identifies specific subsurface locations for several Environmentally-Sustainable Sites for CO₂ Injection (ESSCI) in Bintuni Basin, where the Tangguh production fields are located. Alternatives to <b>atmospheric</b> <b>venting</b> of the estimated CO₂ volume at Tangguh include both non-geologic and geologic disposal options. Non-geologic options such as biosphere sinks (enhanced forest or agricultural growth), deep-ocean sinks (subsea dispersal), and direct commercial usage (e. g. use in beverage or fertilizer production, fire-retardant manufacturing) are impractical and of questionable impact in remote Papua, Indonesia. Several subsurface geological disposal options were investigated, but the most viable geologic disposal option for Tangguh CO₂ is injection into the downdip aquifer leg of the Roabiba Sandstone Formation hydrocarbon reservoir. Injected CO₂, at supercritical phase, is expected to migrate updip into the sealed structural traps at Vorwata or Wiriagar Deep, as the natural gas reserves are produced. A probabilistic ranking of data quality and quantity for five potential ESSCI reservoirs determined that the Middle Jurassic Roabiba Sandstone Formation has the highest likelihood of viable ESSCI sequestration/storage. A probabilistic ranking of data quality and quantity for eight ESSCI structural traps within the western flank of Bintuni Basin, determined that Vorwata, followed by Wiriagar Deep, are the most viable ESSCI structural traps at the Middle Jurassic reservoir level. Five potential ESSCI seals were evaluated and it was determined the best seal potential occurs in the Pre-Ayot Shales, directly overlying the Middle Jurassic reservoir at Vorwata. This unit is capable of holding a 3300 to 4660 foot (1006 to 1420 meter) CO₂_column. Seal integrity of the Pre-Ayot is very good {{because it is a}} relatively homogeneous deep-water shale that is composed primarily of ductile illite and kaolinite clays with a minor quartz and feldspar content. Sequence stratigraphy analysis suggests that the zone extends over the entire Vorwata three-way dip closure, with thickness between 17 feet (5 m) and 233 (71 m) feet. The maximum effective storage capacity of the Middle Jurassic reservoirs for each structure was calculated, taking into account irreducible water, trapped water, and trapped residual gas pore volumes. The Vorwata structure is capable of storing 19. 3 TCFsc supercritical CO₂ at reservoir temperature and pressure. The Wiriagar Deep structure has potential storage capacity of 3. 5 TCFsc, and Ubadari 2. 8 TCFsc, at their respective reservoir temperatures and pressures. A ‘Rating Product Ranking’ was developed to quantify the results of {{the quality and quantity of}} four factors: Reservoir Data, Structure Data, Seal Data, and Storage Ratio. Each structure, and the respective top and lateral seal overlying the Middle Jurassic reservoirs, was evaluated. The net result was that Vorwata rated a 0. 88 on a scale of zero to one, where 1. 0 represents 100 % confidence in ESSCI potential. Ubadari and Wiriagar Deep scored, respectively, 0. 52 and a 0. 45. Finally, the structures were evaluated for relative proximity to the proposed CO₂_source (i. e. the LNG plant location). With a weighted distance factor calculated with the Rating product for each potential injection site, Vorwata rated 0. 88 on a scale of zero to one, Wiriagar scored 0. 24, and Ubadari scored only 0. 09. The Middle Jurassic ‘Roabiba Sandstone Formation reservoir’ at the Vorwata structure has the greatest potential as an ESSCI storage site. The Middle Jurassic ‘Aalenian Sandstone Formation reservoir’ at the Wiriagar Deep is the second-best potential ESSCI storage site. The subsurface ESSCI injection location proposed for the ‘Roabiba Sandstone Formation’ aquifer, 10 km southeast and down-dip from the known gas-water contact (GWC), is on the southeast Vorwata plunging anticlinal nose. An alternate potential ESSCI injection location proposed for the ‘Roabiba Sandstone Formation’ aquifer is 6 km south of and down-dip from the known gaswater contact (GWC) on Vorwata structure southern flank. A key issue was to determine the possible risk of fault re-activation from CO₂_ injection. NE-SW striking vertical faults have the highest risk of re-activation requiring an increase of over ~ 1460 psi (103 kg/cc) over hydrostatic at 14, 000 ft TVDss (4267 m), for slippage to occur. The closest fault with a high risk of re- activation is 5 km northwest of the recommended ESSCI site location. Supercritical CO₂_ pressure is not expected to exceed the estimated pressure determined to cause fault re-activation. A 3 D geological model of the Mesozoic interval was constructed over a large area of western Bintuni Basin. The model was constructed so as to preserve as much geological heterogeneity as possible yet still have a manageable number of active cells. Faults were incorporated into the model as strike-slip vertical fault surfaces (or indexed fault polygons) as a separate attribute. The geo-cellular model was built suitable for importation into a reservoir simulator (VIP), and a 25 -year simulation run for natural gas production from the Vorwata Middle Jurassic reservoir, with concurrent CO₂ injection downdip into the Vorwata Middle Jurassic aquifer at the primary recommended ESSCI site location. The simulation verified the recommended location with the CO₂ slowly migrating into the Vorwata structural trap within the Middle Jurassic reservoir, and not compromising the hydrocarbon reserves or production. It is recommended that additional data be acquired such as conventional core, formation water samples, and specific logs such as dipole-sonic, multi-chambered dynamic formation testers (MDT), and mechanical rotary sidewall coring tools (MSCT). Lastly, several CO₂ monitoring methods and techniques are recommended for Tangguh to monitor CO₂ migration, pressures, and potential leakages. One such method is a vertical monitoring well at the recommended injection site. Other monitoring techniques include smart well completions, detection monitors at production wells with tracers injected prior to CO₂ injection. In addition, crosswell seismic surveys, electromagnetic methods, and electrical-resistance tomography techniques are suggested during the injection phase. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{injection}} {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) into saline formations {{for the purpose of}} limiting greenhouse gas emissions has been proposed {{as an alternative to the}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>venting</b> of carbon dioxide. In the evaluation process for selecting a potential target saline formation for the disposal of carbon dioxide, flow characterisation of the disposed plume should be undertaken by reservoir simulation of the target formation. The movement of injected carbon dioxide in the saline formation is influenced by many factors including the physics of carbon dioxide at deep formation depths and pressure, physical interactions with formation rock and pore water and variations in the rock flow pathways through changes in formation heterogeneity. This thesis investigates the roles of physical interactions on the disposal of carbon dioxide and the ability to contain the injected gas through evaluation of trapping mechanisms such as dissolution of CO 2 in formation water and residual gas trapping through the process of gas-water relative permeability hysteresis. Variable formation heterogeneity is evaluated for its impact on the migration of injected CO 2 plume movement and the role of formation heterogeneity in impeding or accelerating the immobilisation of injected carbon dioxide. Multiple reservoir simulation studies were conducted to evaluate, initially, the role of different trapping mechanisms in immobilising the movement of injected carbon dioxide and subsequently, the role of variations in formation rock in the migration and trapping of and injected plume of carbon dioxide. The major simulation study shows that the selection process for identifying appropriate saline formations should not only consider their size and permeability but should also consider their degree of heterogeneity endemic to the formation. A set of reservoir performance metrics were developed for the CO 2 disposal projects. The metrics were applied to compare plume migration of injected CO 2 (both vertically and laterally) and containment (through dissolution and residual phase trapping) in these studies. The findings demonstrate how formation heterogeneity has a significant impact on the subsurface behaviour of the carbon dioxide. Formation dip influences the rate of migration, with low formation dipping reservoirs having slower rates of vertical migration. Increasing the tortuousity of the migration flow path by either increasing the shale (non-reservoir) content or lengthening the shale baffles in the formation (corresponding to a gradual decrease in reservoir quality), can progressively inhibit the vertical flow of the plume whilst promoting its lateral flow. The increase in the tortuosity of the CO 2 migration pathway delays the migration of CO 2 and increases the residence time for the CO 2 in the formation. Thus, formation heterogeneity impedes the onset of residual gas trapping through hysteresis effects. Ultimately less carbon dioxide is likely to collect under the seal in heterogeneous formations due to increased reservoir contact and long residence times, thereby reducing the risk of seepage to overlying formations. Given sufficient permeability for economic {{injection of}} CO 2, then low to mid net-to-gross heterogeneous saline formations with low formation dip and lengthy intra-bedded shales are desirable for selection for the geological disposal of CO 2. Detailed reservoir characterisation of any potential geological disposal saline formations is required in order to accurately predict the range of outcomes in the long term flow characterisation of injected CO 2 into those formations...|$|R

In {{order to assess}} the {{selectivity}} of graphene-based gas sensing to various gases, measurements are performed in argon (Ar), nitrogen (N 2), oxygen (O 2), carbon dioxide (CO 2), and air by selectively venting the desired gas from compressed gas bottles into an evacuated vacuum chamber. The sensors provide a direct electrical readout in response to changes in high concentrations, from these bottles, of CO 2, O 2, nitrogen and argon, as well as changes in humidity from <b>venting</b> <b>atmospheric</b> air. From the signal response to each gas species, the relative graphene sensitivity to each gas is extracted as {{a relationship between the}} percentage-change in graphene's resistance response to changes in vacuum chamber pressure.

However, under atmospheric concentrations of CO 2, this cross-sensitivity effect is negligible – allowing for the use of graphene-based humidity sensing in atmospheric environments.
