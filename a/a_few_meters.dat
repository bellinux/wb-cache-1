5|$|Weh Island is {{also known}} for ecotourism. Underwater diving, hiking through the {{volcanic}} mountain and beach resorts are the main attractions. A small village, Iboih, {{is known as a}} location for scuba diving. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>meters</b> from Iboih is the Rubiah islet that is known for its coral reefs. There are also several dive operators in Gapang.|$|E
5|$|Many {{hundreds}} of smaller {{members of the}} family, some only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>meters</b> across, have been discovered since {{the launch of the}} SOHO satellite in 1995. None of these smaller comets have survived its perihelion passage. Larger sungrazers such as the Great Comet of 1843 and C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy) have survived their perihelion passage. Amateur astronomers have been successful at discovering Kreutz comets in the data available in real time via the Internet.|$|E
5|$|Strangelets {{are small}} {{fragments}} of strange matter—a hypothetical form of quark matter—that contain roughly {{equal numbers of}} up, down, and strange quarks and that are more stable than ordinary nuclei (strangelets would {{range in size from}} a few femtometers to <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>meters</b> across). If strangelets can actually exist, and if they were produced at the LHC, they could conceivably initiate a runaway fusion process in which all the nuclei in the planet would be converted to strange matter, similar to a strange star.|$|E

5|$|The {{skull of}} Apatosaurus was {{confused}} {{with that of}} Camarasaurus and Brachiosaurus until 1909, when the holotype of A. louisae was found, and a complete skull just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>meters</b> away {{from the front of}} the neck. Henry Fairfield Osborn disagreed with this association, and went on to mount a skeleton of Apatosaurus with a Camarasaurus skull cast. Until 1970, Apatosaurus skeletons were mounted with speculative skull casts, when McIntosh showed that more robust skulls assigned to Diplodocus were more likely from Apatosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Located on the Atlantic {{coast of}} the Sahara Desert, it lies {{on the west coast}} of Africa. With the {{exception}} of Friendship Port and a small fishing port, the coastal strip is mostly left empty and allowed to flood. The coastline includes shifting sandbanks and sandy beaches. There are areas of quicksand close to the harbour. Nouakchott is largely flat and only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>meters</b> above sea level. It is threatened by the sand dunes advancing from its eastern side which pose a daily problem. There have been efforts to save particular areas, including work by Jean Meunier. Owing to the rapid build-up, the city is quite spread out, with few tall buildings. Most buildings are one-story.|$|E
5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>meters</b> thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{has been}} {{reported}} from a depth of , the blacktip reef shark is usually found in water only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>meters</b> deep, and can often be seen swimming close to shore with its dorsal fin exposed. Younger sharks prefer shallow, sandy flats, while older sharks are most common around reef ledges and can also be found near reef drop-offs. This species has also been reported from brackish estuaries and lakes in Madagascar, and freshwater environments in Malaysia, though it is not able to tolerate low salinity to the same degree as the bull shark (C.leucas). At Aldabra in the Indian Ocean, blacktip reef sharks congregate in the channels between reef flats during low tide and travel to the mangroves when the water rises. There is equivocal evidence that sharks from the northern and southern extremes of its distribution are migratory.|$|E
5|$|The {{angle of}} Earth's axial tilt is {{relatively}} stable {{over long periods}} of time. Its axial tilt does undergo nutation; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6years. The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>meters</b> across Earth's surface. This polar motion has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the Chandler wobble. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.|$|E
