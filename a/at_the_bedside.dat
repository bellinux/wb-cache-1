5|$|People {{with poor}} {{clinical}} grade on admission, acute neurologic deterioration, or progressive enlargement of ventricles on CT scan are, in general, indications for {{the placement of}} an external ventricular drain by a neurosurgeon. The external ventricular drain may be inserted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> or in the operating room. In either case, strict aseptic technique must be maintained during insertion. In people with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage the EVD is used to remove cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and blood byproducts that increase intracranial pressure and may increase the risk for cerebral vasospasm.|$|E
5|$|Bache {{was born}} in Birmingham, the second-oldest son of {{well-known}} Unitarian minister Samuel Bache, who ran a private school in conjunction with his wife, Emily Higginson. His older brother, Francis Edward Bache, was a composer and organist, while his sister, Constance Bache, was a composer, pianist and teacher who would write a joint biography of both brothers under the title Brother Musicians. He received some rudimentary musical education at his father's school, but remained a carefree, undistinguished and funloving child until he followed in Edward's footsteps. Like Edward, he studied with Birmingham City Organist James Stimpson and in August 1858, aged 16, he travelled to Germany to attend the Leipzig Conservatory. His father was supposed to accompany him to the university, but was detained <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> of Edward, who was dying of consumption. Undeterred, he made the journey on his own, an early indication of his independence.|$|E

The HINTS test involves: the horizontal head impulse test, observation of nystagmus on primary gaze, and the test of skew. CT scans or MRIs are sometimes used by physicians when diagnosing vertigo.|$|E
25|$|A Greek born in Sicily, Stephen III {{was the son}} of a {{man named}} Olivus. Coming to Rome during the pontificate of Pope Gregory III, he was placed in the monastery of St. Chrysogonus, where he became a Benedictine monk. During the pontificate of Pope Zachary, he was ordained a priest, after which the pope decided to keep him to work at the Lateran Palace. Stephen {{gradually}} rose to high office in the service of successive popes, and was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> of the dying Pope Paul I as powerful factions began manoeuvring to ensure the election of their own candidate in late June 767.|$|E

30|$|Excluding the pregnancy-related procedures, {{hysterectomy}} is {{the most}} commonly performed gynecological procedure [1]. Since the 1990 s, {{there has been an}} increasing trend in the number of hysterectomy procedures performed in laparoscopic approach [2]. In the 2000 s, with the introduction of the daVinci surgical system, surgeons started performing robot-assisted hysterectomy [1],[3],[4]. During a robot-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy, the primary surgeon controls the robotic arms located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> patient’s <b>bedside</b> from <b>the</b> surgeon’s console, which is located away from the patient’s bed; <b>the</b> assistant surgeon <b>at</b> <b>the</b> patient’s <b>bedside</b> assists <b>the</b> primary surgeon in operating the uterus manipulator and using the accessory port of the daVinci system [3].|$|R
25|$|Treatment of a {{subdural}} hematoma {{depends on}} its size and rate of growth. Some small subdural hematomas can be managed by careful monitoring until the body heals itself. Other small subdural hematomas can be managed by inserting a temporary small catheter through a hole drilled through the skull and sucking out the hematoma; this procedure can be done <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside.</b> Large or symptomatic hematomas require a craniotomy, the surgical opening of the skull. A surgeon then opens the dura, removes the blood clot with suction or irrigation, and identifies and controls sites of bleeding. Postoperative complications include increased intracranial pressure, brain edema, new or recurrent bleeding, infection, and seizure. The injured vessels must be repaired.|$|E
25|$|O'Donoghue hid {{a number}} of unused grenades on the farm {{and the two men}} went their {{separate}} ways. At about 2AM at least eight armed men entered the house and went upstairs into the brothers' bedroom. The brothers got up and stood <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> and were asked their names. When they answered, the gunmen opened fire. Both brothers were shot dead and their elderly relative, William Dunlea, was wounded by gunfire. According to Daniel Delaney, the father of the brothers, the gunmen wore long overcoats and spoke with English accents. It is thought that, while searching the site of the ambush, the Auxiliaries had found a cap belonging to one of the volunteers and had used bloodhounds to follow the scent to the Delaney home.|$|E
25|$|Biofilms {{have been}} found to be {{involved}} in a wide variety of microbial infections in the body, by one estimate 80% of all infections. Infectious processes in which biofilms have been implicated include common problems such as bacterial vaginosis, urinary tract infections, catheter infections, middle-ear infections, formation of dental plaque, gingivitis, coating contact lenses, and less common but more lethal processes such as endocarditis, infections in cystic fibrosis, and infections of permanent indwelling devices such as joint prostheses, heart valves, and intervertebral disc. More recently it has been noted that bacterial biofilms may impair cutaneous wound healing and reduce topical antibacterial efficiency in healing or treating infected skin wounds. Early detection of biofilms in wounds is crucial to successful chronic wound management. Although many techniques have developed to identify planktonic bacteria in viable wounds, few have been able to quickly and accurately identify bacterial biofilms. Future studies are needed to find means of identifying and monitoring biofilm colonization <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> to permit timely initiation of treatment.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of these {{investigations}} and the examination in Rome of the results, on 2 April 1993, Pope John Paul II approved the pursual of the Roman phase of the cause, declaring Edmund Rice to be venerable. Two years later, the same Pope approved a miracle attributed to Edmund Rice's intercession. The miracle occurred in 1976, when Kevin Ellison of Newry, had been given only 48 hours to live due to complications from a gangrenous colon, and an apparent lack of viable colon tissue (a conclusion reached by five doctors after hours in surgery). A family friend, Christian Brother Laserian O'Donnell, gave Ellison's parents a relic of Edmund Rice. Many friends prayed for a miracle through the intercession of Rice and a special Mass was offered for Ellison's recovery. Only the relic of Edmund Rice was placed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> of the dying man. The latter survived the 48-hour period during which he was supposed to die, and more besides. Upon investigation, surgeons discovered a considerable length of previously undetected colon. Ellison fully recovered after a few weeks.|$|E
25|$|Often we {{encompass}} {{the record of}} an entire matter by one notation, a single image. For example, the prosecutor {{has said that the}} defendant killed a man by poison, has charged that the motive for the crime was an inheritance, and declared that there are many witnesses and accessories to this act. If in order to facilitate our defense we wish to remember this first point, we shall in our first background form an image of the whole matter. We shall picture the man in question as lying ill in bed, if we know his person. If we do not know him, we shall yet take some one to be our invalid, but not a man of the lowest class, so that he may come to mind at once. And we shall place the defendant <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside,</b> holding in his right hand a cup, and in his left hand tablets, and on the fourth finger a ram's testicles (Latin testiculi suggests testes or witnesses). In this way we can record the man who was poisoned, the inheritance, and the witnesses.|$|E

The horse {{suddenly}} bolted for no reason as the clock struck twelve. Mélisande bursts into tears and says she feels ill and unhappy in the castle. She wants to go away with Golaud. He asks her the reason for her unhappiness but she refuses to say. When he asks her if the problem is Pelléas, she replies {{that he is not}} the cause but she does not think he likes her. Golaud tells her not to worry: Pelléas can behave oddly and he is still very young. Mélisande complains about the gloominess of the castle, today {{was the first time she}} saw the sky. Golaud says that she is too old to be crying for such reasons and takes her hands to comfort her and notices the wedding ring is missing. Golaud becomes furious, Mélisande claims she dropped it in a cave by the sea where she went to collect shells with little Yniold. Golaud orders her to go and search for it at once before the tide comes in, even though night has fallen. When Mélisande replies that she is afraid to go alone, Golaud tells her to take Pelléas along with her.|$|E

25|$|During the 191415 season, on February 3, 1915, Sammy Lichtenhein's Montreal Wanderers {{were awarded}} a game by forfeit over the Shamrocks. The Shamrocks {{had told the}} league {{that they could not}} put a full team on the ice without George McNamara and Howard McNamara, who were <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> of their ill father. Livingstone asked for a postponement, but Lichtenhein refused and the league ruled the game forfeited. In a gesture of sportsmanship, Lichtenhein then made an offer to {{reschedule}} the game and play the Shamrocks on March 6, 1915. Shortly after, with the Wanderers and Ottawa in a tight two-way race for the league championship, Livingstone demanded that Lichtenhein follow through on his offer to play the forfeited game. Lichtenhein was incensed and threatened to have Livingstone thrown out of the NHA. The Wanderers and Ottawa ended the season tied for first place. The NHA executive met on March 4 and decided to recognize the forfeit and not order the Wanderers to play the Shamrocks (the Wanderers were told to pay the Shamrocks $300—the amount they saved by not having to travel to Toronto in February). Instead, a two-game, total-goals series was scheduled between Montreal and Ottawa to determine the champion. The league also rejected Lichtenhein's request to have Livingstone expelled from the NHA. Livingstone and Lichtenhein would continue to feud for years. At one meeting during the 191617 campaign, Lichtenhein grew so infuriated that he offered Livingstone $3,000 to abandon his team. Livingstone countered with a $5,000 bid for Lichtenhein to shut down his Wanderers.|$|E

5000|$|Pel {{shared the}} opinion of Sir William Osler, a {{contemporary}} of his, {{that the way to}} teach and train new physicians is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedsides</b> of patients, rather than at a desk listening to lectures. Osler considered bringing students out of classrooms and into hospital wards - to learn by experience - to be his greatest legacy, and he is credited today as the father of the modern medical residency. Pel gave his inaugural speech on <b>the</b> importance of <b>bedside</b> medical teaching, which serves as {{a good example of the}} level of importance he ascribed to the adoption of this practice. Additionally, Pel was quoted as saying, [...] "Whereas, formerly, the sick patient functioned primarily as an example or illustration of the dominating theoretical education, in the modern world the careful, objective examination of the patient warrants priority attention." ...|$|R

2500|$|However, [...] {{the value}} of {{simulation}} interventions to translating to clinical practice are is still debatable. As Nishisaki states, [...] "there is good evidence that simulation training improves provider and team self-efficacy and competence on manikins. There is also good evidence that procedural simulation improves actual operational performance in clinical settings." [...] However, {{there is a need}} to have improved evidence to show that crew resource management training through simulation. One of the largest challenges is showing that team simulation improves team operational performance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside.</b> Although evidence that simulation-based training actually improves patient outcome has been slow to accrue, today the ability of simulation to provide hands-on experience that translates to the operating room is no longer in doubt.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the largest}} factors that might impact the ability to have {{training}} impact the work of practitioners <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> {{is the ability to}} empower frontline staff (Stewart, Manges, Ward, 2015). Another example of an attempt to improve patient safety through the use of simulations training is patient care to deliver just-in-time service or/and just-in-place. This training consists of 20minutes of simulated training just before workers report to shift. One study found that just in time training improved the transition to the bedside. [...] The conclusion as reported in Nishisaki (2008) work, was that the simulation training improved resident participation in real cases; but did not sacrifice the quality of service. It could be therefore hypothesized that by increasing the number of highly trained residents through the use of simulation training, that the simulation training does in fact increase patient safety.|$|E
2500|$|Hospital paramedics are {{sometimes}} employed {{in either of}} the outpatient and inpatient areas. Emergency departments employ {{the largest number of}} paramedics working inside of hospitals. Considered ambulatory care, emergency departments are classified as an outpatient area of a hospital. Depending on their scope of practice and job description within the emergency department, paramedics are allowed to triage and assess incoming patients, provide analysis and interpretation of both labs and EKGs, intravenous therapy, drug administration, transportation of emergency department patients to diagnostic testing or their inpatient rooms. Paramedics are also employed indireclty in the inpatient areas of hospitals as well. [...] Paramedics are utilized in intensive care units assisting other licensed staff with ICU patients and they are utilized on high risk transport teams by providing transportation, continuation of care and assisting in sedation of patients during minimally invasive and invasive procedures <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> and in diagnostic areas. [...] Because of the nature and purpose of these teams, paramedics work closely with radiology, interventional radiology, nuclear medicine and anesthesiology.|$|E
