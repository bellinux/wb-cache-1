5000|$|In France the préfet (prefect) {{is a top}} ranking {{public servant}} who belongs to the {{so-called}} Corps préfectoral. The function was created on 17 February 1800 by Napoléon Bonaparte after his successful coup d'état of 9 November 1799 which made him Head of State with the title Premier Consul. The prefect's role at that time (until the reform of the function in the 1980s) {{was to be the}} top representative of the central government as well as the chief administrator in a département (which can be compared to a county in most English-speaking nations) [...] His <b>agency</b> <b>services</b> <b>as</b> well as his circumscription (=territory in which he is in charge) are called préfecture. Sub-prefects (sous-préfets, sous-préfecture) operate as assistants in the arrondissements (subdivisions of a département) under his authority and control.|$|E

40|$|This {{study will}} focus {{specifically}} on the transforming effects <b>service</b> <b>agencies</b> experience <b>as</b> they respond to the highly increased need in the surrounding community. A {{review of the literature}} reveals that recovery efforts cannot elicit the needed response and support without a sense of urgency that stems from the event(s) being considered an “emergency. ” The lack of longevity of the initial urgency threatens the resiliency of the agency as the availability of funding and necessary attention is not maintained. A qualitative, exploratory study was conducted by interviewing ten individuals involved in the Rhode Island emergency winter shelter crisis and five involved in recent Gulf Coast emergencies, all of whom had participated either as employees at a <b>service</b> <b>agency</b> or through other in-depth involvement in the recovery efforts. The findings from this study confirm that the emergency response is demanding not only on the community but also on the <b>service</b> <b>agencies</b> <b>as</b> they are challenged to maintain general operations and <b>service</b> <b>as</b> funding and attention are redirected to newly arising demands. Transformation and changes take place in the internal structure of <b>service</b> <b>agencies,</b> personnel in both numbers and assigned tasks, and overall areas of attention the <b>service</b> <b>agency</b> provide, leading to either more effective practice or the downfall of the <b>service</b> <b>agency</b> due to unmanageable demands. Implications of this research study encourage further collaboration between <b>service</b> <b>agencies</b> and community partners working to respond due to the vastly limited resources available and the frequent and superfluous duplication of services...|$|R

40|$|In {{disaster}} management, emergency <b>services</b> <b>agencies</b> such <b>as</b> {{police and}} state emergency services, are growingly using social media microblogging <b>services</b> <b>as</b> an additional channel to distribute {{information to the}} general public. How these emergency <b>services</b> <b>agencies</b> are using these social media channels is still insufficiently understood. This paper introduces Actor-Network-Theory {{as a means to}} understand the emergency <b>services</b> <b>agency</b> social media utilisation. Using the case of the Boston Marathon 2013 Bombing, we apply genre analysis in interpreting the Boston Police Department’s social media communication to understand whether the disaster typology or the social media channel characteristics have an influence on the microblogging utilisation of the emergency <b>services</b> <b>agency.</b> The findings imply that both the social media channel characteristics and the specific characteristics of a disaster influence how a social media channel is utilised...|$|R

40|$|Service {{selection}} {{is a key}} issue in the Future Internet, where applications are built by composing services and content offered by different service providers. Most existing service selection schemas only focus on QoS properties of <b>services</b> such <b>as</b> throughput, latency and response time, or on their trust and reputation level. By contrast, the risk of privacy breaches arising from the selection of component services whose privacy policy is not compliant with customers' privacy preferences is largely ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving Web service composition and selection approach which (i) {{makes it possible to}} verify the compliance between users' privacy requirements and providers' privacy policies and (ii) ranks the composite Web services with respect to the privacy level they offer. We demonstrate our approach using a travel <b>agency</b> Web <b>service</b> <b>as</b> an example of service composition...|$|R
