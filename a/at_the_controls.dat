5|$|The P2Vs {{would be}} first augmented, and then replaced, {{by the more}} capable North American AJ Savage as they became available. These could take off and land on a carrier, {{carrying}} a Fat Man. On 21 August 1950, Hayward was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>controls</b> of the first carrier landing and takeoff of an AJ-1 Savage heavy attack bomber, on the Coral Sea with the Commander of Naval Air Forces Atlantic Fleet (COMAIRLANT), Vice Admiral Felix Stump, in the back seat. However, by mid-December VC-5 still only had six AJ-1s.|$|E
5|$|The RLM had {{acquired}} {{an interest in}} rocket boosters fitted {{for the sake of}} simplicity below the wings of a heavily loaded bomber to cut down the length of runway needed for takeoff. Once in the air the booster canisters would be jettisoned by parachute for reuse. The firm of Hellmuth Walter, at Kiel, handled this development. The first standing trials and tests flights of the Walter HWK 109-500 Starthilfe liquid-fueled boosters were held in 1937 at Neuhardenberg with test pilot Erich Warsitz <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>controls</b> of Heinkel He 111E bearing civil registration D-AMUE.|$|E

5|$|In 1916, No. 43 Squadron {{was formed}} {{under the command}} of Major Sholto Douglas. Aircraft {{equipping}} the squadron included the Sopwith 1½ Strutter, built by the Fairey Aviation company, then in Hayes. The Strutter made its first test flight from Northolt in 1916 with Harry Hawker <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>controls.</b> Fairey conducted test flights at Northolt from 1917 until 1928 when the Air Ministry gave the company notice to vacate the aerodrome. Flights later resumed from the Great West Aerodrome owned by Fairey in Harmondsworth, which was eventually developed as Heathrow Airport. No.43 Squadron went on to fly sorties over France from 17 January 1917, taking part in the Battle of Vimy Ridge between 4 and 8 April 1917.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the shark}} attacks the other kids, hitting {{one of their}} boats, and causing most of them to capsize and crash into {{each other in the}} ensuing panic, {{throwing}} several of them, including Mike and Sean, into the water. The other teens help them out of the water while two of them pull Mike out as the shark goes for him and head back to get help. Sean and the others remain adrift on the wreckage of tangled boats. A Coast Guard marine helicopter that Brody contacted arrives to tow them to shore. Before the pilot can tow them, the shark attacks and sinks the chopper with the pilot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>controls.</b> It then knocks Sean into the water, but Marge sacrifices herself to save him.|$|E
5|$|The first Wellington N2960 {{took off}} from RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk at 09:27 with Wing Commander Richard Kellett <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>controls.</b> No. 9 Squadron {{took off from}} the nearby RAF Honington and formed up over King's Lynn and started out over the North Sea. Feltwell's No. 37 Squadron took off but missed the {{rendezvous}} and {{caught up with the}} main formation an hour later over the North Sea. Once over the Wash they set a course of 040° true, as far as latitude 55°north. The plan was to avoid heavy anti-aircraft artillery concentrations on the Frisian Islands. However, as they left England the cloud broke and they found themselves without cover in a bright crystal clear sky. Two bombers, N2984 and N2894, piloted by Duguid and Kelly turned back; the first due to engine trouble, the other escorting the troubled bomber back to base. The remaining bombers flew north past the Frisian Islands then turned due south, continuing their mission in perfect visibility which made it easy to be spotted by German aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Twenty {{years after}} the Falklands {{conflict}} Bravo November saw service in Iraq, being the first British helicopter to land Royal Marines ashore. After departing from , Bravo November landed the first Royal Marines on to the Al-Faw peninsula to seize oil-pumping facilities before Iraqi troops could destroy them. The second DFC for actions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>controls</b> of Bravo November was awarded to Squadron Leader Steve Carr {{for his role in}} an operation in Iraq. Bravo November was tasked with delivering the Marines to the landing sites marked by US special forces before returning for more troops, guns and freight. The aircraft was being flown at an altitude of less than 100ft with restricted visibility due to dust clouds thrown up by American armoured forces.|$|E
5|$|At 22:56 on 5June, 1944, the six gliders towed by Halifax bombers {{took off}} from RAF Tarrant Rushton. Horsa number one, {{the first of the}} three headed for the Caen Canal, carried Howard with Lieutenant Den Brotheridge's platoon, number two bore Lieutenant David Wood's platoon, and number three carried Lieutenant Smith's platoon. Priday with Lieutenant Hooper's platoon made for the river bridge aboard number four. Horsa number five {{carrying}} Lieutenant Fox's platoon was followed by number six bearing Tod Sweeney's platoon. Each glider also carried five Royal Engineers. Flying over the English Channel at , the bombers crossed the Normandy coast at 00:07 on 6June, 1944 and released their towed gliders. With Wallwork <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>controls,</b> the number one glider crashed into the barbed wire surrounding the canal bridge defences at 00:16. The other two gliders followed at one-minute intervals. The number two glider broke in half and came to halt {{at the edge of a}} large pond. One of the men fell into the water and drowned, becoming the first casualty of the operation. Brotheridge and Smith's platoons headed for the bridge, while Wood's platoon moved towards the trenches on its north east side.|$|E
5|$|Live BBC {{television}} coverage at 08:15 {{the following morning}} showed that although the whole train had been derailed, the rear carriages were standing nearly vertically on the sleepers and ballast. Standard class, the front five carriages, were the worst affected, and the rear four first class carriages were in better condition. The leading carriage, a driving motor coach, had headed down the embankment, and turned end-for-end as it fell. It was lying on its side {{at the foot of}} the embankment. The second carriage had jack-knifed against the first, breaking the coupling, and so had not followed it down the bank. This second carriage came to rest some distance further along the track, at a steep angle with one end in the air. The middle part of the train toppled sideways down the embankment. All the partially friction stir welded carriages remained structurally intact, with damage mainly confined to the crumple zones at their ends. None of the windows broke, and lighting remained in all the carriages. Most injuries occurred in the front two carriages. The driver, who had stayed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>controls</b> (but had little option to move once the accident had started and had no prior indication of derailment), was trapped for about an hour while specialist cutting equipment was used to free him from his cab. The other three members of the crew were in the rear first class section of the train.|$|E

5|$|The first {{successful}} flight of Zveno-1, using a Tupolev TB-1 mothership and two Tupolev I-4 fighters mounted {{on top of}} the wings, took place on 3 December 1931. An error in the sequence of opening the latches by the bomber crew resulted in one of the fighters prematurely separating, but the TB-1 with an I-4 attached to one of the wings remained in controlled flight and the second fighter was soon uneventfully deployed. After latch control was fully moved into the fighters, the normal launch procedure consisted of pilots opening the tail lock and then pulling on the control stick to open the front locks and separate from the bomber. As predicted, the presence of docked fighters had a minimal impact on performance of the mothership, and Zveno-2 Tupolev TB-3 carrying three Polikarpov I-5 fighters handled the same as an ordinary bomber. To mount the aircraft on the wings, they were pushed up special ramps but the centerline aircraft had to be lifted {{on top of the}} fuselage by hand. This was so cumbersome that the centerline I-5 became a permanent fixture on top of the Zveno-2 TB-3 and never started in the air. At one point, the centerline I-5, still with a pilot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>controls</b> to operate the engine, had the wings and the tail surfaces removed and was used purely as fifth powerplant for the bomber mothership.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the propagated sensation along meridians (PSM) produced respectively by acupuncture at a specific acupoint of right-side Quchi (LI 11), a nonacupoint on meridian (control meridian point), and neither meridian nor acupoint (<b>control</b> point). All <b>the</b> stimulated points were on the right brachioradialis along the large intestine meridian of hand Yangming. Surface electromyography (sEMG) was used to reflect {{the activity of the}} brachioradialis along the large intestine meridian of hand Yangming. The PSM rate of LI 11 (59. 21 %) and <b>the</b> <b>control</b> meridian point (53. 95 %) were significantly higher than <b>the</b> <b>control</b> point (38. 16 %) (P< 0. 05). After acupuncture, the brachioradialis sEMG amplitude was 5. 08 ± 2. 93 [*]uV at LI 11, 3. 08 ± 1. 18 [*]uV <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> point, and 2. 77 ± 1. 36 [*]uV <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> meridian point. <b>The</b> amplitude of LI 11 was significantly higher than both <b>the</b> <b>control</b> meridian point and <b>the</b> <b>control</b> point (P< 0. 05). When the sEMG activity of brachioradialis returned to the stable base line, brachioradialis sEMG duration at LI 11 (265 ± 87. 87 [*]s) was significantly longer than that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> meridian point (91. 69 ± 42. 98 [*]s) and <b>the</b> <b>control</b> point (83. 31 ± 32. 76 [*]s) (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, acupuncture activated PSM at all points but showed an acupoint specificity at LI 11 and a meridian specificity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> meridian point...|$|R
