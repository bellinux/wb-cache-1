5|$|A bailey, {{also called}} <b>a</b> <b>ward,</b> was a {{fortified}} enclosure. It {{was a common}} feature of castles, and most had at least one. The keep {{on top of the}} motte was the domicile of the lord in charge of the castle and a bastion of last defence, while the bailey was the home {{of the rest of the}} lord's household and gave them protection. The barracks for the garrison, stables, workshops, and storage facilities were often found in the bailey. Water was supplied by a well or cistern. Over time the focus of high status accommodation shifted from the keep to the bailey; this resulted in the creation of another bailey that separated the high status buildings– such as the lord's chambers and the chapel– from the everyday structures such as the workshops and barracks.|$|E
