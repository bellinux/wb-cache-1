Media will often reprint what has been published, especially when it <b>appears</b> <b>in</b> <b>reputable</b> publications. ‘Flutie factor’ is a short, alliterative way to describe something that is complicated to explain. But what makes a good term is not always the literal truth.” ...|$|R

40|$|Late this summer, a front page, New York {{times article}} on teacher {{education}} led with this statement: A {{growing number of}} states and school districts are short-circuiting the usual route to teacher certification with their own crash courses that put new teachers in the classroom after as little as three weeks [...] . (Zernike, 2000, p. A 1). The article went on to describe the predicted shortage of qualified teachers if we are held to current models of teacher preparation. The tone of the article was harsh, describing schools and colleges of education as having "done more harm than good, " being "cumbersome, " and offering "mind-numbing courses. " Quoting policy makers who "express near hostility to teacher education schools, " the article called for new programs in teacher preparation to address the projected teacher shortage and concerns of quality. I'm uncertain why the article troubled me so much. Certainly I'm used to criticisms of teacher preparation and, too often, I find that some are warranted.
