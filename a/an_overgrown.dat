5|$|In {{this period}} Ruisdael started {{painting}} coastal scenes and sea-pieces, influenced by Simon de Vlieger and Jan Porcellis. Among {{the most dramatic}} is Rough Sea at a Jetty, with a restricted palette of only black, white, blue and a few brown earth colours. However, forest scenes remain a subject of choice, such as the Hermitage's most famous Ruisdael, A Wooded Marsh, dated 1665, which depicts a primeval scene with broken birches and oaks, and branches reaching for the sky amidst <b>an</b> <b>overgrown</b> pond.|$|E
5|$|On {{hearing the}} ambush in the distance, Dodge hurried on toward Fort Hamilton (present-day Wiota, Wisconsin) where he {{gathered}} together {{a company of}} 29 mounted volunteers and sped off to intercept the attackers. He led the chase through tangled underbrush until, breaking into prairie, his force {{caught sight of the}} raiding party. The Kickapoo crossed the Pecatonica River within sight of the pursuing militia, and entered into <b>an</b> <b>overgrown</b> swamp. The militia followed across the swollen river and dismounted when they reached the swamp.|$|E
5|$|In Lillesand, the {{right-of-way}} {{has been}} converted to a road around the city center, although parts have been converted to a pedestrian path. Other parts have been reverted to agricultural land. From Storemyr, the route went through a forest, and has become <b>an</b> <b>overgrown</b> forestry road. From Eikeland to Tveite, the line {{has been converted}} to a hiking trail. At Birkleland, there are few remains of the line, although when leaving the village, part of the line {{is used as a}} pathway. Further along, the route is disused, but fenced in. The station buildings at Tveite and Flaksvand have been kept, the building at Lillesand has been preserved, while the station at Birkeland was dismounted because it was {{in the way of a}} new road.|$|E

5|$|The only track {{left after}} the {{demolishing}} {{was a short}} section at Lier Station, which remained until the station closed in 1973. The old Lier Station has been preserved. The section between Reenskaug, located a few hundred meters (yards) from Lier Station, to Landfald has become the suburban street Lijevegen. From Landfall to Egge, the right-of-way is <b>an</b> <b>overgrown</b> path. From Egge to Muggerud, the right-of-way is used as the street Banevegen. In 1993, the right-of-way from Muggerud to Rønningen was rebuilt as a hiking and riding path. The branch towards Tronstad Bruk has been converted to a street, {{although most of the}} right-of-way north of Rønning has disappeared, as it has been reclaimed as agricultural land, particularly north of Sylling. The station area at Svangstand in intact, with the station building looking just like it did in 1904. Other station buildings have been converted to homes or commercial buildings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 20th century Janáček {{composed}} choral church music including Otčenáš (Our Father, 1901), Constitutes (1903) and Ave Maria (1904). In 1901 the first part of his piano cycle On <b>an</b> <b>Overgrown</b> Path was published, and gradually became one of his most frequently performed works. In 1902 Janáček visited Russia twice. On the first occasion he took his daughter Olga to St.Petersburg, where she stayed to study Russian. Only three months later, he returned to St. Petersburg with his wife because Olga had become very ill. They took her back to Brno, but her health worsened. Janáček expressed his painful feelings for his daughter in a new work, his opera Jenůfa, in which the suffering of his daughter had transfigured into Jenůfa's. When Olga died in February 1903, Janáček dedicated Jenůfa to her memory. The opera was performed in Brno in 1904, with reasonable success, but Janáček felt this was no more than a provincial achievement. He aspired to recognition by the more influential Prague opera, but Jenůfa was refused there (twelve years passed before its first performance in Prague). Dejected and emotionally exhausted, Janáček went to Luhačovice spa to recover. There he met Kamila Urválková, whose love story supplied the theme for his next opera, Osud (Destiny).|$|E

25|$|In 2011, a Maine Forest Service {{employee}} {{found an}} ejection seat from the aircraft near <b>an</b> <b>overgrown</b> logging road while hunting. In May 2012 {{he returned to}} the site to take photos and record identification numbers to confirm it came from the ill-fated B-52. A recovery team retrieved the mostly intact ejection seat. Researchers claim that it is most likely the pilot's seat and remarkably similar to the seat at the snowmobile clubhouse in Greenville. It is the third seat recovered from the crash and preserved for public viewing. The other is in a Bangor museum.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s a {{group of}} American astronomers became {{interested}} in the higher peaks of the Gammons as possible sites for an observatory, and several parties camped for some time on the summits of Mount McKinlay and Benbonyathe Hill (vehicle tracks were also graded to the summits), but nothing further was done (a large observatory is located at Arkaroola, about a hundred kilometres to the northeast). Relics from these camps remain on the summits of the two hills, and there is reportedly still <b>an</b> <b>overgrown</b> vehicle track {{along the top of the}} Blue Range in places.|$|E

25|$|In time {{of actual}} war, great {{discretionary}} powers are constantly {{given to the}} Executive Magistrate. Constant apprehension of War, has the same tendency to render the head too large for the body. A standing military force, with <b>an</b> <b>overgrown</b> Executive, will not long be safe companions to liberty. The means of defense against foreign danger, have been always the instruments of tyranny at home. Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to excite a war, whenever a revolt was apprehended. Throughout all Europe, the armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the people.|$|E
25|$|Edwin Link had {{developed}} a passion for flying in his boyhood years, but {{was not able to}} afford the high cost of flying lessons. So, upon leaving school in 1927, he started developing a simulator, an exercise which took him 18 months. His first pilot trainer, which debuted in 1929, resembled <b>an</b> <b>overgrown</b> toy airplane from the outside, with short wooden wings and fuselage mounted on a universal joint. Organ bellows from the Link organ factory, the business his family owned and operated in Binghamton, New York, driven by an electric pump, made the trainer pitch and roll as the pilot worked the controls.|$|E
25|$|The story {{takes place}} in Spain in May–June 1944, {{five years after the}} Spanish Civil War, during the early Francoist period. The {{narrative}} intertwines this real world with a mythical world centered on <b>an</b> <b>overgrown</b> abandoned labyrinth and a mysterious faun creature, with whom the main character, Ofelia, interacts. Ofelia's stepfather, the Falangist Captain Vidal, hunts the Spanish Maquis who fight against the Francoist regime in the region, while Ofelia's pregnant mother Carmen grows increasingly ill. Ofelia meets several strange and magical creatures who become central to her story, leading her through the trials of the old labyrinth garden. The film employs make-up, animatronics, and CGI effects to bring life to its creatures.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the Harlem River and Port Chester {{tracks were}} {{maintained}} by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. New stations designed by Cass Gilbert were opened in 1908, but the line's stations were all closed by 1937, having suffered from low ridership. The company went bankrupt in 1968, merging with Penn Central Transportation Company. Penn Central itself went bankrupt and merged with Conrail in 1976, and Amtrak bought the old Harlem River and Port Chester tracks, integrating the route into its Northeast Corridor. The station house for the line's Bartow station still exists, albeit as a deteriorated shell; the station's roof burned down after it was closed. <b>An</b> <b>overgrown</b> path leads from the bridle trail to the former station site.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, DNA {{analysis}} {{confirmed that}} Grüner Veltliner {{was a natural}} crossing of Savagnin (Traminer) and obscure Austria grapevine {{from the village of}} Sankt Georgen am Leithagebirge located outside Eisenstadt in Burgenland region of eastern Austria. The vine was first found in 2000 in <b>an</b> <b>overgrown</b> part of a pasture in a location where there had not been any vineyard since the late 19th century, and is assumed to have been the last vine in this location for over a century. Local experts were not able to determine the variety of the vine. Only when it was threatened to be ripped out in 2005 additional samples were taken and later analyzed at Klosterneuburg. Genetic analysis in the following years by Ferdinand Regner was able to determine that St. Georgener-Rebe is a parent variety to Grüner Veltliner.|$|E
25|$|Further churchyard grave markers are to {{the murdered}} parish constable Henry Trigg; to Thomas Beard (died 1800?); and to Mary Ann Griffin (died 1899 aged 34), wife of Lewis Phillips of Berden Hall. The Beard stone {{contains}} a serpentine moulding at {{each side of the}} top meeting a central circular moulded device, defining three engraved fields, and all with carved pictorial details, the central an angel holding an anchor. <b>An</b> <b>overgrown</b> slab running from the stone contains a similar circular engraved device. The Griffin stone is chamfered-arch topped with inset floral carving, semi-circular side columns topped with floriate capitals, and inlaid inscriptions. Near to the Griffin stone is a plinth tomb with moulded base, and overhanging top with dentils below and a pyramid top. It is to members of the Roberts family, one of whom was Roland Brandram Roberts of Kirimetiya Estate, Ceylon (died 1910 aged 46), who was cremated at Golders Green, with his ashes interred in Berden graveyard. Two marble and granite sarcophagus-style tombs {{are to the}} north of the church; one to George Seabrook (died 1885); the other Thomas Seabrook (died 1847) and his wife, Elizabeth (died 1871). George and Thomas Seabrook were of Berden Priory. A further headstone is to Brigadier Sir Francis Smith Reid and his wife. Reid was a senior British Army officer during and after the Second World War, and Secretary to the Speaker of the House of Commons.|$|E

25|$|Several BFS {{personnel}} were honoured for their work. Jack Owen, a BFS officer and former Royal Marine, was awarded an MBE in 1963 following a tense incident at Bohldamm near Lüchow in Lower Saxony. The border ran along a stream, but its precise location was disputed. The West Germans considered {{the far side}} of the stream to be the location of the border, while the East Germans regarded the border as lying in the middle of the stream. <b>An</b> <b>overgrown</b> cobbled footbridge crossed the stream but was blocked by the East Germans with a movable barbed wire trestle barrier situated at the far end of the bridge. One day in 1962 the East Germans moved the barrier to the middle of the bridge, despite protests from West German border guards and customs officials. The situation escalated when the East Germans warned that they would shoot anyone who touched the trestle and backed up their warning by emplacing machine guns and armoured cars on their side of the stream. The West Germans called up a BFS platoon and a British Army section to back them up. Owen called the East Germans' bluff by walking onto the bridge with two British soldiers and carrying the trestle back to the eastern side of the stream. He then stood by it for the next eight hours to make sure that it would not be moved again.|$|E
