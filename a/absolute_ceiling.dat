The company started converting five aircraft as the Mustang Mk X.

While these aircraft's <b>absolute</b> <b>ceiling</b> {{is much higher}} than standard operational purposes—in Concorde's case, it was tested to 68,000 ft—it is impossible to reach for most (because of the vertical speed asymptotically approaching zero) without afterburners or other devices temporarily increasing thrust.

It is informative, ingenious, and constructive. But its proposal for extending emissions targets and enlarging the number of countries to which they apply is deeply flawed, partly by carrying forward the flaws inherent in the Kyoto Protocol (KP hereafter). This comment will address the intellectual framework of the proposal, identify three fatal flaws (all inherent in the Kyoto Protocol), and suggest an alternative approach.

Policy analysts should acknowledge this from the outset.

Reliance on heritage can ensure redundant success but will diminish advancements {{in science and technology}} that are integral to the success of future missions.

Since the pre-phase A design stage mandates that system engineers establish complex and crucial decisions governing the mission design, system engineers would greatly benefit from an apples-to-apples comparison of the mass and cost benefits from different technologies across a range of performance parameters. The Cost and Mass Evaluation of Technology (CoMET) removes the “hand-waving” arguments in EDL technology benefits, and identifies possible points of diminishing returns for the advancement of specific technologies. Ultimately, CoMET: EDL is a design-to-cost model that answers the following question: Would further technology development just be “polishing the cannonball?” EDL sub-systems include, but are not limited to, aeroshell and thermal protection entry systems; parachute systems; powered descent and landing systems; power systems; and in-situ exploration systems of aerobots. CoMET explores the technology trades between mass and cost in the collaborative engineering environment regarding key technology areas and launch vehicle considerations. To demonstrate CoMET’s potential in confronting future mission concepts that require new operational approaches and technology advancements, a planetary probe mission is designed around the exploration of Saturn’s moon, Titan. In January 14, 2005, the planetary probe Huygens befell Titan’s surface in search of life’s origins. On the Titan-Huygens probe, the limitations of communications relay geometry and battery power vastly restricted the operational time, scientific goals, and total returns of this mission. Without the improvement of battery efficiency or the evolution of nuclear power systems, state of the art technology will always restrict planetary scientists to short-duration missions and miniscule data sampling. Furthermore, to capitalize on each planet’s or moon’s unique environment, future probes will require innovative systems of in-situ exploration, such as blimps for mobility in dense atmospheres. This paper explores mass, cost, and technology trade-offs of an airship among several EDL technologies within general mission requirements of a mission to Titan.

5000|$|Using up the {{effectiveness}} of Traits that way can be interpreted in many different ways, depending on the Trait itself: firing all of one's ammunition, burning up energy, fuel, magical power, electricity, mental endurance or confidence, decreasing the character's calm, faith, concentration, “chi” or whatever. The only thing in the game that “saves” a Trait from becoming less effective after one usage is the Trait possessing a bonus feature that explicitly allows using that Trait {{several times in the}} same scene. While no rules for building your own Traits were given in the Quickstart Preview, the Core Rulebook explained this as a feature requiring a specific number of points in character creation. This is called a Signature. Players can buy up to two levels of [...] "Signature" [...] per Trait. Three usages per scene are the <b>absolute</b> <b>ceiling</b> before a player must switch to another Trait or start taking Detriment Dice. In the game stats for the characters, some of the Traits can be used with the same default power, or likelihood of success, of 1d12 twice or three times in the same scene, while others move either up or down in terms of power: It is possible to have a Trait that will start out using a best-of-three roll with 3d12, then using only the better of 2d12 on the second usage, and a single d12 on the third. The reverse is also possible: a single d12 for the first usage, the better of two d12 results for the second one, and best of three for the third, representing a character that gets increasingly powerful or skillful over a short period of time. The Core Rulebook establishes these bonuses as so-called Regulated Signatures, Diminishing Signatures, and Power-Up Signatures accordingly. All can be taken as one or two levels, but only one type of Signature is allowed per Trait (i.e. the player must decide whether he wants it to be Regulated, Diminishing, or Power-Up).|$|E

40|$|Although the {{application}} of a ring cowl to an airplane with an air-cooled engine increases the maximum L/D and the high speed to an appreciable extent, the performance in climb and ceiling is not increased as much as one would expect without analyzing the conditions. When a ring cowl is installed on an airplane, the propeller is set at a higher pitch to allow the engine to turn its rated r. p. m. at the increased high speed. V/nD is increased and the propeller efficiency at high speed is increased slightly. The ratio of r. p. m. at climbing speed, V(sub c), to the r. p. m. at maximum speed, V (sub m) is dependent upon the ratio of V(sub c) to V(sub m). The increase in V(sub c) for all airplane with ring cowl i s not as great as the increase in V(sub m), so that the ratio V(sub c) /V(sub m) is less than for the airplane without ring. Consequently the r. p. m. and full throttle thrust power available are less at V(sub c) for the airplane with ring cowl and in spite of the increase in L/D due to the installation of the ring, the excess thrust power available for climbing is not appreciably changed. The same method of reasoning accounts for the small increase in <b>absolute</b> <b>ceiling</b> in spite of a large increase in L/D maximum...|$|E

Sequence {{differences}} in the tRNA-proline (tRNApro) end of the mitochondrial control-region of three species of Pacific butterflyfishes accumulated 33 – 43 times more rapidly than did changes within the mi-tochondrial cytochrome b gene (cytb). Rapid evolution in this region was accompanied by strong transition/ transversion bias and large variation in {{the probability of a}} DNA substitution among sites. These substitution con-straints placed an <b>absolute</b> <b>ceiling</b> on the magnitude of sequence divergence that could be detected between in-dividuals. This divergence ‘‘ceiling’ ’ was reached rap-idly and led to a decay in the relative rate of control-region/cytb b evolution. A high rate of evolution in this section of the control-region of butterflyfishes stands in marked contrast to the patterns reported in some other fish lineages. Although the mechanism underlying rate variation remains unclear, all taxa with rapid evolution in the 58 -end of the control-region showed extreme transi-tion biases. By contrast, in taxa with slower control-region evolution, transitions accumulated at nearly the same rate as transversions. More information is needed to understand the relationship between nucleotide bias and the rate of evolution in the 58 -end of the control-region. Despite strong constraints on sequence change, phy-logenetic information was preserved in the group of re-cently differentiated species and supported the clustering of sequences into three major mtDNA groupings. Within these groups, very similar control-region sequences were widely distributed across the Pacific Ocean and were shared between recognized species, indicating a lack of mitochondrial sequence monophyly among species...|$|E
