50|$|Thin {{films of}} hafnium oxides, used in modern {{semiconductor}} devices, are often deposited with an <b>amorphous</b> <b>structure</b> (commonly by atomic layer deposition). Possible {{benefits of the}} <b>amorphous</b> <b>structure</b> have led researchers to alloy hafnium oxide with silicon (forming hafnium silicates) or aluminium, which were found to increase the crystallization temperature of hafnium oxide.|$|R

5000|$|The primary {{methods used}} to make {{mesoporous}} organosilicas are evaporation-induced self-assembly, surfactant-mediated synthesis, post-synthetic grafting, and co-condensation. Organosilicas with <b>amorphous</b> <b>structures</b> are typically made by functionalizing organic groups rather than directly integrating the functional groups in the framework, which produces a periodic structure. [...] Furthermore, basic hydrolytic conditions typically produce a periodic structure because of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions between hydrolyzed precursors that then self-assemble.|$|E
30|$|All of the ALD-deposited nano-oxide {{thin films}} on silicon {{substrates}} {{in this study}} have an <b>amorphous</b> <b>structure</b> according to the XRD analysis shown in Table  1. The <b>amorphous</b> <b>structure</b> of all samples probably resulted from low deposition temperature [33], high aluminum content [34], and thin thickness [35]. In Table  2, with nano-oxide thin film thicknesses increasing from 91.5 to 249.3  nm, the uniformities decrease slowly from 2.26 % to 1.07 %. This probably can be explained with {{the relationship between the}} structure and surface roughness of ZnO:Al 2 O 3 film. The percentage of ZnO cycle is 75 % in this study, and the XRD results show the <b>amorphous</b> <b>structure</b> for all samples suggesting that the ZnO nanocrystal growth is interrupted by the Al 2 O 3 layers and the <b>amorphous</b> <b>structure</b> results in smoother surface when thickness increases [22].|$|R

50|$|Data on the {{corrosion}} behaviour of CMCs {{are scarce}} except for oxidation at temperatures above 1000 °C. These properties {{are determined by}} the constituents, namely the fibres and matrix. Ceramic materials in general are very stable to corrosion. The broad spectrum of manufacturing techniques with different sintering additives, mixtures, glass phases and porosities are crucial for the results of corrosion tests. Less impurities and exact stoichiometry lead to less corrosion. <b>Amorphous</b> <b>structures</b> and non-ceramic chemicals frequently used as sintering aids are starting points of corrosive attack.|$|E
50|$|The {{production}} of amorphous alloys requires a manufacturing technology that operates {{on the basis}} of the necessary cooling rates, which is known as rapid solidification, or melt spinning technology. <b>Amorphous</b> <b>structures</b> are characterized by the absence of a crystal lattice or a long range order. With this random, spatially uniform arrangement of the constituent atoms, their structure is similar to that of liquids.The nature of this production process is the reason why amorphous alloys are offered only in the form of thin, ductile metal foils. Subsequently, tapes, parts and preforms can be made by e.g. slitting, cutting, stamping and etching.|$|E
50|$|Although {{electroless}} nickel {{is widely considered}} an engineering coating it does not compare well to other coatings in terms of certain mechanical properties. Ductility is one of these. Electroless nickel is considered a very strong yet brittle material. The relatively low ductility {{is due to the}} various microcrystalline and <b>amorphous</b> <b>structures</b> that limit plastic deformation, i.e. the ability to “stretch” without fracture. It is not uncommon for heavy build deposits (in excess of 25 µm) to crack when exposed to severe loads. This is especially evident in lower phosphorus films or those plated from older baths (in excess of 150 g/l of orthophosphate) with high tensile stress.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to their}} non-crystalline (<b>amorphous)</b> <b>structures,</b> Liquidmetals are harder than alloys of {{titanium}} or aluminum of similar composition. The zirconium and titanium based Liquidmetal alloys achieved yield strength of over 1723 MPa, {{nearly twice the}} strength of conventional crystalline titanium alloys (Ti6Al4V is ~830 MPa), and about the strength of high-strength steels and some highly engineered bulk composite materials (see tensile strength {{for a list of}} common materials). However, the early casting methods introduced microscopic flaws that were excellent sites for crack propagation which led to Vitreloy being fragile like glass. Although strong, these early batches shattered easily when struck. Newer casting methods, adjustments of the alloy mixtures and other changes have improved this.|$|E
50|$|A {{heterojunction}} is {{the interface}} that occurs between two layers or regions of dissimilar crystalline semiconductors. These semiconducting materials have unequal band gaps {{as opposed to}} a homojunction. It is often advantageous to engineer the electronic energy bands in many solid-state device applications, including semiconductor lasers, solar cells and transistors ("heterotransistors") to name a few. The combination of multiple heterojunctions together in a device is called a heterostructure, although the two terms are commonly used interchangeably. The requirement that each material be a semiconductor with unequal band gaps is somewhat loose, especially on small length scales, where electronic properties depend on spatial properties. A more modern definition of heterojunction is the interface between any two solid-state materials, including crystalline and <b>amorphous</b> <b>structures</b> of metallic, insulating, fast ion conductor and semiconducting materials.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} <b>amorphous</b> <b>structures</b> in the laser cladding. A kind of Ni-Cr-Al alloy was sprayed on the substrate, which was ZL 111 alloy, {{to be the}} coating material. The coating was clad by a 5 kW {{transverse}} flow CO 2 laser. The observation of SEM and TEM revealed that in the laser cladding there were <b>amorphous</b> <b>structures</b> which appeared two different morphologies: one was space curved flake-like, which existed in the white web-like structures; the other was fir leaf-like, which existed in the grain-like structures.

We found that the total electronic energy of the <b>amorphous</b> <b>structure</b> was the smallest {{as a function of}} the number of atoms contained by the structure. As the total electronic energy is linked to the toughness of the structure, we may say that the structure of such hybrid polymer has the highest toughness for the <b>amorphous</b> <b>structure.</b> Comment: 4 figures 1 table 11 page...|$|R

5|$|Thermoplastics, by contrast, form long {{molecular}} chains, {{which are}} often coiled or intertwined, forming an <b>amorphous</b> <b>structure</b> without any long-range, crystalline order. Some thermoplastics may be fully amorphous, while others have a partially crystalline/partially <b>amorphous</b> <b>structure.</b> Both <b>amorphous</b> and semicrystalline thermoplastics have a glass transition, above which welding can occur, but semicrystallines also have a specific melting point which is above the glass transition. Above this melting point, the viscous liquid will become a free-flowing liquid (see rheological weldability for thermoplastics). Examples of thermoplastics include polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride (PVC), and fluoroplastics like Teflon and Spectralon.|$|R

40|$|Electropulsing {{by means}} of {{discharge}} of a condenser with the decay time (τ) of ms causes the athermal crystallization of metallic glasses when the initial current density (id 0) {{is higher than the}} threshold value (id 0,c). It is indicated that the major local <b>amorphous</b> <b>structures</b> in Zr 50 Cu 50 are the <b>amorphous</b> <b>structures</b> with the short range order (SRO) similar to crystalline cubic (c) ZrCu which is the equilibrium crystalline phase above 988 K, although the mixture of crystalline Zr 2 Cu and Zr 7 Cu 10 is the equilibrium phase below 988 K. Electropulsing tests on Zr 50 Cu 50, Zr 50 Cu 40 Al 10 and Zr 50 Cu 35 Al 10 Ni 5 metallic glasses indicate that the <b>amorphous</b> <b>structures</b> with SRO similar to cZrCu are the major local <b>amorphous</b> <b>structures</b> in these metallic glasses, and their volume fractions decrease in the order of Zr 50 Cu 50, Zr 50 Cu 40 Al 10 and Zr 50 Cu 35 Al 10 Ni 5. The amount of the <b>amorphous</b> <b>structures</b> with SRO similar to cZrCu may govern the thermal stability of these metallic glasses. Further in Zr 50 Cu 50 metallic glasses, the inverse transformation from the electropulsing-induced fine crystallites to the amorphous phase for subsequent electropulsing with increasing id 0, and the Ostwald-ripening-like phenomenon under electropulsing were observed...|$|E

40|$|Lithium thiophosphate-based {{materials}} are attractive as solid electrolytes in all-solid-state lithium batteries because glass or glass-ceramic structures of these {{materials are}} associated with very high conductivity. In this work, we modeled lithium thiophosphates with <b>amorphous</b> <b>structures</b> and investigated Li+ mobilities by using molecular dynamics calculations based on density functional theory (DFT-MD). The structures of xLi 2 S-(100 - x) P 2 S 5 (x = 67, 70, 75, and 80) were created by randomly identifying appropriate compositions of Li +, PS 4 3 -, P 2 S 7 4 -, and S 2 - and then annealing them with DFT-MD calculations. Calculated relative stabilities of the <b>amorphous</b> <b>structures</b> with x = 67, 70, and 75 relative to crystals with the same compositions were 0. 04, 0. 12, and 0. 16 kJ/g, respectively. The implication is that these <b>amorphous</b> <b>structures</b> are metastable. There was good agreement between calculated and experimental structure factors determined from X-ray scattering. The differences between the structure factors of <b>amorphous</b> <b>structures</b> were small, except for the first sharp diffraction peak, which was affected by the environment between Li and S atoms.
