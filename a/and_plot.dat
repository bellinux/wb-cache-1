40|$|AbstractThe {{watercourse}} section surveying {{has become}} more and more important in engineering reconnaissance nowadays, and based on ever urgent social demand for watercourse section surveying, the paper analyzed the subject of how to improve the watercourse section surveying <b>and</b> <b>plotting</b> efficiency. Through studying the opposite side surveying procedure inside the total station and the section surveying <b>and</b> graph <b>plotting</b> method in CASS, an integration of field and office working pattern for section surveying was summarized.

5|$|Beneath a Steel Sky is a 2D {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. The player uses a point-and-click interface {{to interact with}} the environment and to guide protagonist Robert Foster through the game's world. To solve puzzles and progress in the game, the player collects items that may be combined with one another, used on the environment, or given to non-player characters (NPCs).

Unlike in most adventure games at the time, the protagonist's death is possible, after which the player starts from the last save point. In the remastered iOS version, the point-and-click interface is replaced with a touch user interface, a hint system is added, and hotspots are highlighted.|$|E
