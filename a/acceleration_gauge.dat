40|$|The dynamic dipole polarizabilities for {{the four}} lowest triplet states (2 ^ 3 S, 3 ^ 3 S, 2 ^ 3 P and 3 ^ 3 P) of helium are {{calculated}} using the B-spline configuration interaction method. Present values of the static dipole polarizabilities in the length, velocity and <b>acceleration</b> <b>gauges</b> are in good agreement with the best Hylleraas results. Also the tune-out wavelengths {{in the range from}} 400 nm to 4. 2 μm {{for the four}} lowest triplet states are identified, and the magic wavelengths in the range from 460 nm to 3. 5 μm for the 2 ^ 3 S → 3 ^ 3 S, 2 ^ 3 S → 2 ^ 3 P, and 2 ^ 3 S → 3 ^ 3 P transitions are determined. We show that the tune-out wavelength of 2 ^ 3 S state is 413. 038 28 (3) nm, which corroborates the value of Mitroy and Tang (Phys. Rev. A 88, 052515 (2013)), and the magic wavelength around 1066 nm for the 2 ^ 3 S → 3 ^ 3 P transition can be expected for precision measurement to determine the ratio of transition matrix elements (2 ^ 3 S → 2 ^ 3 P) / (3 ^ 3 P→ 6 ^ 3 S).

40|$|Since their {{discovery}} in 1880, piezoelectric devices have found widespread use in engineering applications {{due to their}} simplicity and ease of application. High {{on the list of}} applications is their versatility in sensor technology applications particularly as the key element in modern day accelerometers. Furthermore, recent advances in piezoelectric crystals have made them even more cost effective for use in low cost sensors for condition monitoring of structure. Traditional methods utilising <b>acceleration</b> and strain <b>gauge</b> signals for detecting an incipient failure in structures suffer from inherent difficulty due to massive damping characteristics of the structures which results in minute fault signals being buried in dominant background signal components. In this paper, common PZT materials such as PZT- 5 A and PZT- 5 H were used in the construction of piezoceramic (PZT) sensors. Experimental tests were performed to evaluate the performance of the PZT sensors in detecting a simulated bearing crack operating at low speeds (100 rpm) and comparisons made with a commercial accelerometer and an ultra-sound prob. The results show that the PZT sensor is a more sensitive device compared to a commercial sensors in detecting a minute crack of a rolling element bearing operating at low speeds. Work is in progress in using the PZT sensors for condition monitoring of bridge structures...|$|R
40|$|Herein I {{propose a}} multi-scale {{dynamical}} analysis {{to facilitate the}} physical interpretation of tide gauge records. The technique uses graphical diagrams. It is applied to six secular-long tide gauge records representative of the world oceans: Sydney, Pacific coast of Australia; Fremantle, Indian Ocean coast of Australia; New York City, Atlantic coast of USA; Honolulu, U. S. state of Hawaii; San Diego, U. S. state of California; and Venice, Mediterranean Sea, Italy. For comparison, an equivalent analysis {{is applied to the}} Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index and to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) index. Finally, a global reconstruction of sea level and a reconstruction of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index are analyzed and compared: both sequences cover about three centuries from 1700 to 2000. The proposed methodology quickly highlights oscillations and teleconnections among the records at the decadal and multidecadal scales. At the secular time scales tide gauge records present relatively small (positive or negative) accelerations, as found in other studies. On the contrary, from the decadal to the secular scales (up to 110 -year intervals) the tide <b>gauge</b> <b>accelerations</b> oscillate significantly from positive to negative values mostly following the PDO, AMO and NAO oscillations. In particular, the influence of a large quasi 60 - 70 year natural oscillation is clearly demonstrated in these records. The multiscale dynamical evolutions of the rate and of the amplitude of the annual seasonal cycle of the chosen six tide gauge records are also studied. Comment: 11 figure, 3 tables, 16 pages.

40|$|Errors in {{applying}} regression models and wavelet filters {{used to analyze}} geophysical signals are discussed: (1) multidecadal natural oscillations (e. g. the quasi 60 -year Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)) {{need to be taken}} into account for properly quantifying anomalous <b>accelerations</b> in tide <b>gauge</b> records such as in New York City; (2) uncertainties and multicollinearity among climate forcing functions prevent a proper evaluation of the solar contribution to the 20 th century global surface temperature warming using overloaded linear regression models during the 1900 - 2000 period alone; (3) when periodic wavelet filters, which require that a record is pre-processed with a reflection methodology, are improperly applied to decompose non-stationary solar and climatic time series, Gibbs boundary artifacts emerge yielding misleading physical interpretations. By correcting these errors and using optimized regression models that reduce multicollinearity artifacts, I found the following results: (1) the sea level in New York City is not accelerating in an alarming way, and may increase by about 350 mm from 2000 to 2100 instead of the previously projected values varying from 1130 mm to 1550 mm estimated using the methods proposed by Sallenger et al. (2012) and Boon (2012), respectively; (2) the solar activity increase during the 20 th century contributed about 50 % of the 0. 8 K global warming observed during the 20 th century instead of only 7 - 10 % (IPCC, 2007; Benestad and Schmidt, 2009; Lean and Rind, 2009). These findings stress the importance of natural oscillations and of the sun to properly interpret climatic changes. Comment: 21 pages, 10 Figure...|$|R
40|$|The Thomas–Reiche–Kuhn sum rule, {{within the}} <b>acceleration</b> <b>gauge</b> for the {{transition}} dipole moment, is used to partition {{the total number of}} electrons in a molecule and to define atomic populations, which can be related to corresponding experimental estimates of atomic polar tensors from IR intensities. As a bond dipole moment can only be defined for diagonal atomic polar tensors, it is shown that the assumption of a C–H bond moment, transferable from molecule to molecule in the alkane series, is physically unreliable. From experimental IR intensities of methane we infer that, for the equilibrium geometry, µC–H = 0. 339 D, directed C−H+. Accordingly, it is argued that the theoretical bond dipole moments, estimated for the C–H bond in methane via localization procedures of SCF wave functions, are questionable, as they predict the opposite polarity. Finally, a resolution of the electric dipole moment into atomic contributions is suggested...|$|E
40|$|Atomic {{populations in}} a {{molecule}} have been defined via the 'Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule for oscillator strengths written within the <b>acceleration</b> <b>gauge.</b> These atomic populations {{are related to}} nuclear electric shieldings, i. e., to geometrical derivatives of electric dipole moment, and can therefore be connected with observable infrared intensities. A number of relationships can be considered to test a priori the quality of calculated electronic charges and to assess their physical meaning. It is shown via extended numerical tests on the first members of the alkane series that the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn populations are consistent with a (small) polarity C+-H- of carbon-hydrogen bond in methane, for which a bond dipole moment can be exactly defined. Although the idea of bond dipole cannot be extended to the C-H fragments belonging to other alkane molecules {{in the absence of}} local C- 3 v symmetry, the calculations prove that the same electron charge polarization should characterize the whole homologous series.

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{arguments}} put forward by van Enk et al, we discuss aspects {{of the theory of}} atom-laser field interactions as they relate to the calculation of properties for which free-free transitions play a significant role. Our conclusion is that: (i) according to the standard definition of the electric dipole approximation, which is what has been employed until now in all non-perturbative calculations of multiphoton processes, the on-energy shell singularity for the length and velocity gauges is real when the one-electron continuum is represented rigorously by energy-normalized scattering functions. On the other hand, the <b>acceleration</b> <b>gauge</b> does not give rise to this singularity. (ii) When the full coupling operator A(r) · p + 1 / 2 A 2 (r) rather than A(r) · p is used, the singularity persists for the electric dipole {{as well as for the}} higher multipoles. (iii) The use of box-normalized basis sets only leads to a model space whereby even repeated (and computationally expensive) calculations with increasing box size lack intrinsic rigour and the certainty that convergence implies accuracy...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{represents the}} effort of several physicists, presently engaged in numerical simulations on computers of the APE 100 family. The document intends to present {{a wide spectrum of}} projects, that will become possible with the realization of a parallel computer in the one TeraFlops range. Based on previous experience, several common demands have emerged. Besides computer power, good performances can be achieved if the new machine will have: 1. a compact structure, with a small number of nodes per direction and the minimum possible total number of nodes; 2. more than 120 data registers per node; 3. a local memory of 20 [...] 30 GigaWords; 4. I/O performances of at least 60 MegaBytes/sec; 5. availability of double precision floating point operations; 6. integer, arithmetic and logical operations on MADmille; 7. local addressing capability, i. e. the processing nodes may access their own memories using different local addresses. The reasons for the above requirements will be clearer from the discussion in secs. 2 [...] 9 and will be summarized in the conclusion. Here, we only want to add a few words about 7., which will not be discussed any more in the following. Many physical studies require processing of large matrices both by rows and columns. A typical example is a multi-dimensional Fourier transform, which finds many applications, such as Fourier <b>acceleration</b> in lattice <b>gauge</b> theories, proposed by R. K. Wilson and collaborators, metereology, climatology, signal analysis, etc. In these cases, one requires a "data transposition phase", that reshuffles the data among the nodes of the machine from a "cut along the row" distribution toward a "cut along the column" one. A local addressing capability allows a high efficiency implementation for matrix transposition on a 3 D intercon [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Herein I discuss common {{errors in}} {{applying}} regression models and wavelet filters {{used to analyze}} geophysical signals.

(2012) and Boon (2012), respectively; (2) the solar activity increase during the 20 th century contributed at least about 50 % of the 0. 8 °C global warming observed during the 20 th century instead of only 7 - 10 % (e. g. : IPCC, 2007; Benestad and Schmidt, 2009; Lean and Rind, 2009; Rohde et al., 2013). The first result was obtained by using a quadratic polynomial function plus a 60 yr harmonic to fit a required 110 yr-long sea level record. The second result was obtained by using solar, volcano, greenhouse gases and aerosol constructors to fit modern paleoclimatic temperature reconstructions (e. g. : Moberg et al., 2005; Mann et al., 2008; Christiansen and Ljungqvist, 2012) since the Medieval Warm Period, which show a large millennial cycle that is well correlated to the millennial solar cycle (e. g. : Kirkby, 2007; Scafetta and West, 2007; Scafetta, 2012 c).
