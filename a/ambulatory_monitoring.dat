40|$|Forty-four {{patients}} with primary ventricular fibrillation or recurrent ventricular tachycardia were stabilized on an antiarrhythmic drug regimen before electrophysiologic study and 24 to 72 hours of <b>ambulatory</b> electrocardiographic <b>monitoring</b> were performed. The longterm predictive {{value of these}} two tests was then compared retrospectively for a 12 to 32 month (mean 18) follow-up period, during which all patients continued receiving the same antiarrhythmic drug regimen. Electrophysiologic testing induced ventricular tachycardia (≥ 3 beats) in 26 patients; 23 had a poor clinical outcome (positive predictive value 88 %), defined as sudden death or sustained ventricular tachycardia. In 18 {{patients with}} a negative electrophysiologic test, only 1 had a poor clinical outcome (negative predictive value 94 %). <b>Ambulatory</b> electrocardiographic <b>monitoring</b> accurately predicted outcome in 7 of 10 patients with a positive recording (positive predictive value 70 %), defined as three or more consecutive ventricular extrasystoles, and in 17 of 34 patients with negative <b>ambulatory</b> <b>monitor</b> recordings (negative predictive value 50 %).

We hypothesised that the discomfort during cuff inflation {{would increase the}} heart rate (HR) measured with 24 -h <b>ambulatory</b> BP <b>monitoring</b> compared to a following HR measurement with a 24 -h Holter monitor. Methods: The study population (n = 56) were recruited from the outpatient&rsquo;s clinic at the Department of Nephrology, Aalborg Hospital, Aarhus University Hospital at Aalborg, Denmark. All the patients had chronic kidney disease (CKD). We compared HR measured with a 24 -h Holter monitor with a following HR measured by a 24 -h <b>ambulatory</b> BP <b>monitoring.</b> Results: We found a highly significant correlation between the HR measured with the Holter monitor and HR measured with 24 -h <b>ambulatory</b> blood pressure <b>monitoring</b> (r = 0. 77, p &lt;&nbsp; 0. 001). Using the Bland-Altman plot, the mean difference in HR was only 0. 5 beat/min during 24 hours with acceptable limits of agreement for both high and low HR levels. Dividing the patients into groups according to betablocker treatment, body mass index, age, sex, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment, statins treatment, diuretic treatment, or calcium channel blocker treatment revealed similar results as described above. Conclusion: The {{results indicate that the}} discomfort induced by cuff inflation during 24 -h <b>ambulatory</b> BP <b>monitoring</b> does not increase HR.

50|$|Home {{monitoring}} is a {{cheap and}} simple alternative to ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, {{although it does}} not usually allow assessment of blood pressure during sleep which may be a disadvantage.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{research}} and guidelines recommend the routine use of <b>ambulatory</b> blood pressure <b>monitoring</b> for {{the diagnosis of}} hypertension, so accuracy of such monitors {{is more important than}} ever. AIM: : To systematically review the literature regarding the accuracy of <b>ambulatory</b> <b>monitors</b> currently in use. METHODS: Medline, Embase, Cinahl, the Cochrane database, Medion and the dabl Educational Trust website were searched until February 2011. No language or publication date limits were applied. Data were extracted separately by two independent reviewers. Methodological quality was assessed by whether a validation protocol had been used and followed correctly. RESULTS: From 5420 journal articles identified, 108 met the inclusion criteria. Excluding studies assessing monitors no longer in use, 40 relevant studies were found using 21 different monitors. Thirty-eight (95 %) studies used a validation protocol of which 28 studies assessed a monitor in the general population. Of these, protocols were passed in 24 of 28 studies, but 12 of 24 (50 %) found a difference of at least 5 mmHg systolic between the test device and the reference standard for 30 % or more of the readings. Of the 10 studies conducted in special population groups (e. g. pregnancy, elderly people), only four devices passed the protocols. Only six (16 %) studies correctly adhered to the protocols. CONCLUSION: Published validation studies assessed most <b>ambulatory</b> <b>monitors</b> as accurate, but many failed to adhere to the underlying protocols, undermining this conclusion and peer review standards. Furthermore, most monitors which 'passed' validation showed significant variation in blood pressure from the reference standard, highlighting inadequacies in older validation protocols.

5000|$|Optimal blood {{pressure}} fluctuates over a 24-hour sleep-wake cycle, with values {{rising in the}} daytime and falling after midnight. The reduction in early morning {{blood pressure}} compared with average daytime pressure {{is referred to as}} the night-time dip. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring may reveal a blunted or abolished overnight dip in blood pressure. This is clinically useful information because non-dipping blood pressure is associated with a higher risk of left ventricle hypertrophy and cardiovascular mortality. By comparing the early morning pressures with average daytime pressures, a ratio can be calculated which is of value in assessing relative risk. Dipping patterns are classified by the percent of drop in pressure, and based on the resulting ratios a person may be clinically classified for treatment as a [...] "non-dipper" [...] (with a blood pressure drop of less than 10%), a [...] "dipper," [...] an [...] "extreme dipper," [...] or a [...] "reverse dipper," [...] as detailed in the chart below.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Computerized {{adaptive}} tests (CATs) have abundant theoretical {{advantages over}} established static instruments, which could improve <b>ambulatory</b> <b>monitoring</b> of patient-reported outcomes (PROs).

METHODS: We reviewed {{the literature and}} evaluated existing data to discuss the potential of CATs for use in <b>ambulatory</b> <b>monitoring</b> outside clinical facilities. RESULTS: Computerized adaptive tests are not being used for <b>ambulatory</b> <b>monitoring,</b> but initial results from their use in health care research allow for discussion of some issues relevant to ambulatory care. Evidence shows that CATs can capture the most relevant health outcomes as well as established static tools, with substantially decreased respondent burden. They can be more precise than static tools of similar length and can reduce floor and ceiling effects. Computerized adaptive tests can reliably measure a construct over time with different items, which yields the potential of introducing item exposure control in <b>ambulatory</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Studies have shown that CATs can {{be at least as}} valid as well-designed static tools in group comparisons, but further investigation is needed to determine whether psychometric advantages lead to increased responsiveness of CATs. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Ambulatory</b> <b>monitoring</b> of PROs demands short, yet very precise measurements, which can be repeated up to many times a day. Computerized adaptive tests may address several present shortcomings in <b>ambulatory</b> <b>monitoring</b> of PROs efficiently.

It is not known whether anti-ischemic drugs exert similar effects on ischemia during <b>ambulatory</b> <b>monitoring</b> and exercise treadmill testing. Methods. Patients with stable coronary artery disease and ischemia during treadmill testing and <b>ambulatory</b> <b>monitoring</b> were randomized to receive amlodipine (n = 51) or atenolol (n = 49). Each group underwent a counterbalanced, crossover evaluation of single drug and placebo, followed by evaluation of the combination. Results. Amlodipine and the combination prolonged exercise time to 0. 1 -mV ST segment depression by 29 % and 34 %, respectively (p < 0. 001) versus 3 % for atenolol (p = NS). During <b>ambulatory</b> <b>monitoring,</b> the frequency of ischemic episodes decreased by 28 % with amlodipine (p = 0. 083 [NS]), by 57 % with atenolol (p < 0. 001) and by 72 % with the combination (p < 0. 05 vs. both single drugs; p < 0. 001 vs. placebo). Suppression of ischemia during exercise testing and <b>ambulatory</b> <b>monitoring</b> was similar in patients with and without exercise-induced angina. Exercise time to angina improved by 29 % with amlodipine (p < 0. 01), by 16 % with atenolol (p < 0. 05) and by 39 % with the combination (p < 0. 005 vs. placebo, atenolol and amlodipine).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{diagnosis}} of hypertension {{has traditionally been}} based on blood-pressure measurements in the clinic, but home and ambulatory measurements better correlate with cardiovascular outcome, and <b>ambulatory</b> <b>monitoring</b> is more accurate than both clinic and home monitoring in diagnosing hypertension. We aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of different diagnostic strategies for hypertension. METHODS: We did a Markov model-based probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis. We used a hypothetical primary-care population aged 40 years or older with a screening blood-pressure measurement greater than 140 / 90 mm Hg and risk-factor prevalence equivalent to the general population. We compared three diagnostic strategies-further blood pressure measurement in the clinic, at home, and with an ambulatory monitor-in terms of lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life years, and cost-effectiveness. FINDINGS: <b>Ambulatory</b> <b>monitoring</b> was the most cost-effective strategy for the {{diagnosis of}} hypertension for men and women of all ages. It was cost-saving for all groups (from -£ 56 [95 % CI - 105 to - 10] in men aged 75 years to -£ 323 [- 389 to - 222] in women aged 40 years) and resulted in more quality-adjusted life years for men and women older than 50 years (from 0 · 006 [0 · 000 to 0 · 015] for women aged 60 years to 0 · 022 [0 · 012 to 0 · 035] for men aged 70 years). This finding was robust when assessed {{with a wide range of}} deterministic sensitivity analyses around the base case, but was sensitive if home monitoring was judged to have equal test performance to <b>ambulatory</b> <b>monitoring</b> or if treatment was judged effective irrespective of whether an individual was hypertensive. INTERPRETATION: <b>Ambulatory</b> <b>monitoring</b> as a diagnostic strategy for hypertension after an initial raised reading in the clinic would reduce misdiagnosis and save costs. Additional costs from <b>ambulatory</b> <b>monitoring</b> are counterbalanced by cost savings from better targeted treatment. <b>Ambulatory</b> <b>monitoring</b> is recommended for most patients before the start of antihypertensive drugs.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Most {{transplant}} centers exclude prospective living kidney donors with hypertension from donation.

We therefore conducted a prospective study to determine the impact of routine <b>ambulatory</b> BP <b>monitoring</b> on diagnosis of hypertension in potential donors and the value of other baseline characteristics in predicting ambulatory BP results. Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements: We compared classification of hypertension status by clinic BP and by <b>ambulatory</b> BP <b>monitoring</b> in 178 potential living kidney donors. Results: Of 63 individuals with hypertension by clinic BP, 62 % had white-coat hypertension by ambulatory BP and were therefore eligible to donate. Of 115 individuals who were normotensive by clinic BP, 17 % had masked hypertension by ambulatory BP and were excluded from donation. Individuals with masked hypertension were older, were more likely to be male, and had a somewhat higher clinic BP than individuals with sustained normotension. Individuals with white-coat hypertension had a somewhat lower clinic diastolic BP than individuals with sustained hypertension. Conclusions: Routine <b>ambulatory</b> BP <b>monitoring</b> may identify a large number of individuals with white-coat hypertension and a smaller but significant number of individuals with masked hypertension, ensuring adequate protection of potential donors and accurate assessment of donor risk. Differences in baseline characteristics are small and are not clinically useful in distinguishing individuals with masked hypertension from individuals with sustained normotension or individuals with white-coat hypertension from individuals with sustained hypertension, demonstrating the importance of <b>ambulatory</b> BP <b>monitoring</b> in this population...|$|R
