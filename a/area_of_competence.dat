5000|$|Business, {{information}} and infrastructure architectures {{share a common}} goal: to provide optimum support for an organisation's operations. This is impossible without input from, and feedback between, the three architectural disciplines. To act effectively within the architectural process {{and at the same}} time be sufficiently responsive, each discipline must follow the dynamics and structures which underline their own respective <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence.</b> This certainly applies to infrastructure architecture, which must make its role easily recognisable by clarifying the terms it uses within the infrastructure domain. The easiest way to do this is to describe infrastructure solutions in logical and functional terms. DYA|Infrastructure defines the [...] "capability" [...] of a solution with a set of quality attributes. Quality attributes also have an important role in harmonizing the architectural process across the three architectural disciplines, because regardless of the underlying (technological) structure, quality attributes can be reconciled across the domains and be used throughout the entire solution. At the same time, they also provide input for the engineering, creation and testing of solutions within their own <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence.</b> That is why quality attributes are a recurring theme throughout the different phases and activities of infrastructure architecture and why it is of the utmost importance to choose and define quality attributes carefully. At the very least, they must illustrate the unique and inherent quality of an infrastructure solution.|$|E
