40|$|Background: To date, {{clinical}} trials have reported inconsistent {{results on the}} efficacy of the combination therapy of Memantine plus an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) over a single-drug therapy in the treatment of <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> disease. This meta-analysis aim is to assess {{the efficacy of the}} combination therapy of Memantine plus an AChEI in the treatment of <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> disease compared with a single-drug therapy using an AChEI. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library databases were searched through December 2013. Seven randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. A random-effects meta-analysis was used. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed. Results: A combination therapy of an AChEI with memantine was associated with modestly better effects in terms of cognition and global function compared to a monotherapy with an AChEI. The effects of the combination therapy were no better than a monotherapy for daily living activity. However, the combination therapy showed benefits over a monotherapy for the behavioral outcome and the effect was independent of the stage of the disease. Moreover, the rate of adverse effects did not differ between a combination therapy and a single therapy. Conclusions: The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that the combination therapy is more appropriate and should be administered for patients in more advanced stages. However, not all patients may benefit from the combination treatment. Identification of subgroups of patients with <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> disease who will benefit more from the combination treatment is needed...|$|E

We investigated potential connections between these two observations at the membrane level by testing the hypothesis that A? 1 42 relocates membrane cholesterol. Results Oligomers of A? 1 42, but not the monomeric peptide, inserted into cholesterol containing phosphatidylcholine monolayers with an anomalously low molecular insertion area, suggesting concurrent lipid rearrangement. Membrane neutron diffraction, including isomorphous replacement of specific lipid hydrogens with highly scattering deuterium, showed that A? 1 42 insertion was accompanied by outward displacement of membrane cholesterol, towards the polar surfaces of the bilayer. Changes in the generalised polarisation of laurdan confirmed that the structural changes were associated with a functional alteration in membrane lipid order. Conclusion Cholesterol is known to regulate membrane lipid order, and this can affect a wide range of membrane mechanisms, including intercellular signalling.

40|$|Phosphoinositides are {{important}} components of eukaryotic membranes {{that are required}} for multiple forms of membrane dynamics. Phosphoinositides are involved in defining membrane identity, mediate cell signalling and control membrane trafficking events. Due to their pivotal role in membrane dynamics, phosphoinositide de-regulation contributes to various human diseases. In this review, we {{will focus on the}} newly emerging regulation of the PIKfyve complex, a phosphoinositide kinase that converts the endosomal phosphatidylinositol- 3 -phosphate [PI(3) P] to phosphatidylinositol- 3, 5 -bisphosphate [PI(3, 5) P 2) ], a low abundance phosphoinositide of outstanding importance for neuronal integrity and function. Loss of PIKfyve function is well known to result in neurodegeneration in both mousemodels and human patients. Our recent work has surprisingly identified the amyloid precursor protein (APP), the central molecule in <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> disease aetiology, as a novel interaction partner of a subunit of the PIKfyve complex, Vac 14. Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} APP modulates PIKfyve function and PI(3, 5) P 2 dynamics, suggesting that the APP gene family functions as regulator of PI(3, 5) P 2 metabolism.

It is axonally transported, endocytosed and sorted to different cellular compartments where amyloid beta, Aβ, is produced. However, the mechanism of APP trafficking remains unclear. We present evidence that huntingtin associated protein, HAP, may reduce Aβ production by regulating APP trafficking to the non-amyloidogenic pathway. HAP, and APP are highly colocalized in a number of brain regions, with similar distribution patterns in both mouse and human brains. They are associated with each other, the interacting site is the, of HAP,. APP is more retained in cis-Golgi, trans-Golgi complex, early endosome and ER-Golgi intermediate compartment in HAP, neurons. HAP, deletion significantly alters APP endocytosis and reduces the re-insertion of APP into the cytoplasmic membrane.

Antioxidant nutrients may help to protect these brain regions. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether plasma vitamin C and E status is lowered in subjects with AD and dementia. DESIGN: A case control {{study was conducted in}} 93 institutionalized subjects aged 65 + yrs. The dementia group (N = 43) included 15 subjects with <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> Disease (AD) and 28 subjects with senile dementia, while the control group included 50 subjects with no cognitive impairment. Subjects with uncontrolled hypertension and/or diabetes were excluded from the study. Plasma vitamin C and E was determined using the 2, 6 - dichlorophenolindophenol and the HPLC methods, respectively.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the influence of two neurotoxic <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> disease peptide analogues with different lengths and amino acid compositions, amyloid b 25 35 and amyloid b 22 40, on the dynamics of phospholipid membranes by means of quasi elastic neutron scattering in the picosecond time domain. Samples of pure phospholipids DMPC DMPS and samples with embedded amyloid b peptides have been compared. The peptide concentration was 3 mol for both amyloid b peptides. The sample temperature was set to 320 K, where the samples are in the liquid crystalline phase, which is the physiologically relevant phase of biological membranes. The data have been analyzed with a purely phenomenological model, which combines two different motions with different time constants. These two motions have been assigned to a long range translational diffusion and a spatially restricted localized diffusion. The different lengths of the peptides leads to different positions and orientations inside the membrane bilayers. Thus, different influences on the dynamics are also expected. Both amyloid b peptides significantly affected the ps dynamics of oriented lipid membranes. Mainly, they accelerated the long range translational diffusion even though the peptide concentration was quite low. This finding is of relevance {{for all kinds of}} protein protein interactions, which are strongly influenced by the lateral diffusion, such as signal transduction cascades and energy transfer.

40|$|Neurodegeneration is a chronic, {{progressive}} and debilitating condition that affects {{majority of the}} World 2 ̆ 7 s elderly population who are at greater risk. Numerous scientific studies suggest {{that there could be}} a common underlying molecular mechanism that promotes the degeneration and the subsequent neuronal loss, however so far the progress in this direction is rather limited. Abnormal protein misfoldings, as well as protein plaque formations in the brain, are some of the hallmark characteristic features of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). Genetic and environmental factors, oxidative stress, excessive reactive oxygen species formation, mitochondrial dysfunction, energy depletion and autophagy disruption etc. are some of the widely suspected mechanisms that manifest the cognitive, motor and emotional symptoms of these NDDs. Motivated by some molecular traits found in common in several NDDs, network-based systems biology tools and techniques were used in this study to identify critical molecular players and underlying biological processes that are common for Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s,</b> <b>Alzheimer</b> 2 ̆ 7 s and Huntington 2 ̆ 7 s disease. Utilizing multiple microarray gene expression datasets, several biomolecular networks such as direct interaction, shortest path, and microRNA regulatory networks were constructed and analyzed for each of the disease conditions. The network-based analysis revealed 26 genes of potential interest in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s,</b> 16 in <b>Alzheimer</b> 2 ̆ 7 s and 30 in Huntington 2 ̆ 7 s disease. Many new microRNA-target regulatory interactions were identified. For each disorder, several routes for possible disease initiation and protection scenarios were uncovered. A unified neurodegeneration mechanism network was constructed by utilizing the significantly differentially expressed genes found in common in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s,</b> <b>Alzheimer</b> 2 ̆ 7 s and Huntington 2 ̆ 7 s microarray datasets.

40|$|Protein aggregation, {{arising from}} {{the failure of the}} cell to {{regulate}} the synthesis or degradation of aggregation-prone proteins, underlies many neurodegenerative disorders. However, the balance between the synthesis, clearance, and assembly of misfolded proteins into neurotoxic aggregates remains poorly understood. Here we study the effects of modulating this balance for the amyloid-beta (Ab) peptide by using a small engineered binding protein (ZAb 3) that binds with nanomolar affinity to Ab, completely sequestering the aggregation-prone regions of the peptide and preventing its aggregation. Co-expression of ZAb 3 in the brains of Drosophila melanogaster expressing either Ab 42 or the aggressive familial <b>Alzheimer</b> 9 <b>s</b> disease (AD) associated E 22 G variant of Ab 42 abolishes their neurotoxic effects. Biochemical analysis indicates that monomer Ab binding results in degradation of the peptide in vivo. Complementary biophysical studies emphasize the dynamic nature of Ab aggregation and reveal that ZAb 3 not only inhibits the initial association of Ab monomers into oligomers or fibrils, but also dissociates pre-formed oligomeric aggregates and, although very slowly, amyloid fibrils. Toxic effects of peptide aggregation in vivo can therefore be eliminated by sequestration of hydrophobic regions in monomeric peptides, even when these are extremely aggregation prone.

40|$|<b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> disease (AD) is {{the most}} common form of dementia. It is {{progressive}} and unrecovered. Memory loss is the earliest and important syndrome. AD is characterized by a progressive accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. Evidence suggests that the increased production or decreased clearance of amyloid ? (A?) which is the main constituent of amyloid plaques triggers a cascade that ultimately leads to <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> pathology, making it a promising target for the treatment of AD. One strategy targeting A? that has shown promise is increasing its clearance by binding A? peripherally, either by immunization or treatment with agents that bind A? creating a peripheral sink that shifts the equilibrium of free A? from the central nervous system (CNS) to the periphery, then reduce A? burden in the brain and increase the clearance of A?. One such agent is a protein named plasma gelsolin, which has 6 subunits. Evidence shows that gelsolin can bind to A? to prevent A? deposits and disassemble A? fibrils. Furthermore, even delivery of the plasmid of the gene for plasma gelsolin, which can be expressed peripherally, in a mouse model of <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> disease can decrease A? burden in the brain. But there still are some questions around the treatments of AD. For example, in 2008, more than 100 clinical trials of AD failed, including the treatments targeting A?. And we notice that most treatments need multiple dosing because the traditional medicines are not reproducible by themselves. In order to found an ideal treatment method for one dose life long term treatment, we develop a new gene therapy method for AD by focusing on the promising target A?. We packaged the coding sequence for human plasma gelsolin into an AAV- 8 (Associate Adeno Virus) vector. Then we peripherally delivered, via the tail vein, this vector into APP/PS 1 mice, a kind of AD mouse model. After behavior training, we find that peripheral expression of plasma gelsolin retards the memory loss in treated mice compare with control mice. We found that treatment reduced A? burden in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that the reduced memory loss in treated mice may be due to reduced A? burden in the brain. These results show that we may have developed a new method for one dose life long term treatment for AD which has been characterised with A? burden in the brain...|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to explore}} how {{prospective}} and retrospective memory are affected by health in old age. In this regard, we have focused on dementia disorders, depressive symptomatology, and thyroid functions. Prospective memory involves remembering to perform actions, such as paying bills or taking one s medication. Retrospective memory involves remembering previous events or previously learned information, such as the content of a book. The memory process {{can be divided into}} three stages: encoding (forming new memories), storage (consolidation of information), and retrieval (remembering what we have previously encoded). In Study I, three groups were included: persons with <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> disease, persons with vascular dementia, and healthy control persons. The groups were compared on prospective and retrospective memory tasks. The two dementia groups were impaired compared to controls on both prospective and retrospective memory, and the impairment was evident for all stages of the memory process (i. e., encoding, storage and retrieval). However, there were no differences between the two dementia groups regarding the extent or pattern of memory deficits. Study II examined how prospective and retrospective memory were affected during the so called preclinical phase of <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> disease (i. e., before the disorder had progressed so much that it could be diagnosed). Both prospective and retrospective memory was impaired three years prior to diagnosis. In addition, the results showed that more people at risk of developing <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> disease could be identified when the combined results from the two memory tasks were taken into account, compared to using only one task at the time. The unique contributions of both memory measures indicate that they are, at least in part, separable entities. When studying retrospective memory in more detail, we found that the impairment in preclinical <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> disease was present across all three memory stages. Study III examined how depressive symptoms affected prospective and retrospective memory. Depressive symptoms refers to a continuum, ranging from states (such as mild dysphoria) that are common also among healthy persons to severe depressive disorders. The results showed that retrospective memory was negatively affected by depressive symptoms. The effect was evident for storage and retrieval, whereas there was a non-significant trend in the same direction for encoding. Prospective memory, however, was unaffected by depressive symptoms. If these results are valid, this can help us separate persons with depression from persons with early stage dementia, which in many cases is difficult. Study IV examined the effect of thyroid functioning on prospective memory. Thyroid function was measured through serum levels of two hormones: thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T 4). All participants were free from thyroid disorders. In spite of this, the results revealed that persons with higher TSH levels performed better on the prospective memory task. T 4 levels were not related to memory performance. Previous research has shown a corresponding association between TSH and retrospective memory. The conclusion is that thyroid functioning has an impact on cognition, {{even in the absence of}} overt disease. To summarize, both prospective and retrospective memory are sensitive cognitive abilities, easily affected by disorders and other factors related to health. There are, however, some differences with regard to when, and how, these two forms of memory are affected. It is important to investigate this issue further, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the cognitive challenges that persons with different disorders or symptoms are facing. This can, in turn, lead to the development of new cognitive aids. In addition, cognitive psychology research can in some cases help us make faster and more accurate diagnoses...|$|E

40|$|The {{confirming}} {{diagnosis of}} Alzheimer's disease includes {{an assessment of}} the concentration of neuritic plaques in the temporal lobe of the brain. The presence of abnormal levels of neurotrophic factors in Alzheimer's disease is one possible explanation for the increased concentration of aggregates of overgrown neurites in the neuritic plaques of Alzheimer's disease. The protein S 100 beta, a neurotrophic factor produced by astroglia in the brain, induces neurite outgrowth in cerebral cortical neurons. The generation of specific S 100 beta antibodies, the cloning of a full-length cDNA encoding the S 100 beta mRNA, {{and the development of a}} neurite extension assay system for S 100 beta allowed testing of the hypothesis that <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease <b>S</b> 100 beta expression is elevated in brain temporal lobe where neuritic plaques are concentrated.

The cells containing the increased S 100 beta were reactive astrocytes; the neuritic plaques were surrounded by S 100 beta-containing astrocytes. The elevated levels of S 100 beta provides a link between the prominent reactive gliosis and neuritic plaque formation in this common disease of the elderly and raises the possibility that S 100 beta contributes to Alzheimer's disease neuropathology...|$|R

40|$|<b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> disease (AD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common forms of {{neurodegenerative}} disorders connected with gradual loss of cognitive functions such as episodic memory.

The aim of this thesis is to investigate the potential use of combining multivariate analysis with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to monitor disease and treatment in AD. Due to the complexity of <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> disease, we hypothesized, that considering patterns of disease markers is more useful for the evaluation of patients or a study outcome, than making decisions based on single biomarkers alone. Studies I and II combine multivariate analysis with MRS to monitor disease and treatment effects in two different mouse models.

Study IV investigates the added value of MRS in the early diagnosis of AD. In this study the multivariate models were built combining both MRI and MRS variables. The methods could successfully be applied in both animals and humans. Metabolic fingerprints of disease and treatment could be identified as well as patterns of atrophy.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Patients with Alzheimers Disease (AD) have {{substantial}} impairment in many cognitive domains, including language processing. The most obvious and best studied language problems in <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> patients are in production: {{the frequency and}} nature of word-finding difficulties in AD {{have been the subject}} of much research (e. g., Bayles, Tomoeda & Trosset, 1990; Huff, Corkin & Growdon, 1986; Kempler, Andersen & Henderson, 1995). By comparison, relatively little research has addressed the comprehension problems which also impair Alzheimer patients abilities to answer questions, follow instructions, and participate in conversations. Because the language comprehension problems in AD occur in the context of memory and other cognitive impairments, it is difficult to determine the underlying cause of the comprehension impairments.

40|$|International audienceIn <b>Alzheimer</b> 3 <b>s</b> disease (AD), the {{hippocampus}} {{is an early}} site of tau pathology and neurodegeneration. Histological {{studies have shown that}} lesions are not uniformly distributed within {{the hippocampus}}. Moreover, alterations of different hippocampal layers may reflect distinct pathological processes. 7 T MRI dramatically improves the vi-sualization of hippocampal subregions and layers. In this study, we aimed to assess whether 7 T MRI can detect volumetric changes in hippocampal layers in vivo in patients with AD. We studied four AD patients and seven control subjects. MR images were acquired using a whole-body 7 T scanner with an eight channel transmit– receive coil. Hippocampal subregions were manually segmented from coronal T 2 *-weighted gradient echo images with 0. 3 × 0. 3 × 1. 2 mm 3 resolution using a protocol that distinguishes between layers richer or poorer in neuronal bodies. Five subregions were segmented in the region of the hippocampal body: alveus, strata radiatum, lacunosum and moleculare (SRLM) of the cornu Ammonis (CA), hilum, stratum pyramidale of CA and stratum pyramidale of the subiculum. We found strong bilateral reductions in the SRLM of the cornu Ammonis and in the stratum pyramidale of the subiculum (p b 0. 05), with average cross-sectional area reductions ranging from − 29 % to − 49 %. These results show {{that it is possible to}} detect volume loss in distinct hippocampal layers using segmentation of 7 T MRI. 7 T MRI-based segmentation is a promising tool for AD research...|$|R
40|$|Selenoprotein R (SelR) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in maintaining intracellular redox balance by reducing the R-form of methionine sulfoxide to methionine. As SelR is highly expressed in brain and closely related to <b>Alzheimer</b> 9 <b>s</b> disease (AD), its biological functions in human brain become a research focus. In this paper, the selenocysteine-coding TGA of SelR gene was mutated to cysteine-coding TGC and used to screen the human fetal brain cDNA library with a yeast two-hybrid system. Our results demonstrated that SelR interacts with clusterin (Clu), a chaperone protein. This protein interaction was further verified by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP), and pull-down assays. The interacting domain of Clu was determined by co-IP to be a dynamic, molten globule structure spanning amino acids 315 to 381 with an amphipathic-helix. The interacting domain of SelR was investigated by gene manipulation, ligand replacement, protein over-expression, and enzyme activity measurement to be a tetrahedral complex consisting of a zinc ion binding with four Cys residues. Study on the mutual effect of SelR and Clu showed synergic property between the two proteins. Cell transfection with SelR gene increased the expression of Clu, while cell transfection with Clu promoted the enzyme activity of SelR. Co-overexpression of SelR and Clu in N 2 aSW cells, an AD model cell line, significantly decreased the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, FRET and co-IP assays demonstrated that Clu interacted with b-amyloid peptide, a pathological protein of AD, which suggested a potential effect of SelR and Ab with the aid of Clu.

40|$|Background ⁄ Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess gait {{characteristics}} during simple and dual task in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and compare them with those of healthy elderly subjects and mild <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> disease (AD) patients. Methods: We proposed a gait analysis to appreciate walking (simple task and dual task) in 14 MCI, 14 controls and six AD subjects who walked at their preferred speed. A 20 -second period of stabilized walking was used to calculated stride frequency, stride length, symmetry and regularity. Speed walking was measured by electrical photocells. Results: Variables measured during simple and dual tasks showed an alteration of motor function as well in mild AD patients as in MCI patients. Conclusion: At the end of this preliminary study, we defined a specific gait pattern for each cognitive profile. Further researches appear necessary to enlarge the study cohort. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Alzheimer</b> <b>s</b> disease (AD) is {{the most}} common form of {{dementia}} among elder. Neuropathological hallmarks include amyloid plaque formation, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal and synaptic loss. The deposit of senile plaques is consistent with induction of oxidative stress, and since free radical scavengers can alleviate amyloid-beta-induced oxidative stress markers, this study aims to identify the neuroprotective effects of the selenium compounds (ebselen and diphenyl diselenide) on the neurotoxicity of amyloid-beta in primary cultures of murine hippocampal neurons. Samples were subjected to immunocytochemistry and western blotting techniques to determine what influence the treatments may have on synaptic protein SNAP- 25 and neuronal death. There was a strong increase in relative cell viability associated with ebselen and diphenyl diselenide treatment. Significant increases were observed in the level of synaptic marker synaptosomal-associated protein SNAP- 25 with both selenium compounds treatment. Although demonstrated the potential protective effect of selenium compounds in the course of AD, further investigations of synaptic function are important as a therapeutic strategy for A...|$|E

An emerging explanation of the molecular mechanism, which results in neurodegeneration, places the cause of neurotoxicity of the amyloid peptides on their potentially negative interaction with neuronal membranes. It is known that amyloid amp; 946; peptides interact with the membrane, modifying the membrane s structural and dynamic properties. We present a series of X ray diffraction experiments on anionic model lipid membranes containing various amounts of cholesterol. These experiments provide experimental evidence for an interaction of both the full length amyloid amp; 946; 1 42 peptide, and the peptide fragment amyloid amp; 946; 22 40 with anionic bilayer containing cholesterol. The location of the amyloid amp; 946; peptides was determined from these experiments, with the full length peptide embedding into the membrane, and the peptide fragment occupying 2 positions on the membrane surface and embedded into the membrane cor...|$|E
40|$|The {{zebrafish}} (Danio rerio), {{a tropical}} {{fresh water fish}} originally found in the rivers of India and Bangladesh has become a popular vertebrate model system over the last decade. The rapid sequencing of the zebrafish genome together with the latest advances in forward and reverse genetics has made this model organism more fascinating {{as it can be}} used to decipher the genetic mechanisms involved in the vertebrate development. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) regulates the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis in response to stress. Alteration in the production of CRH can lead to Cushing s syndrome, anxiety-related disorders and other neurodegenerative disorders such as <b>Alzheimers</b> <b>s</b> disease, Parkinson s dementia and Huntington s disease. In mammals it was reported that a POU class III gene by name Brn- 2 is essential for the development of specific neuroendocrine cell types. Brn- 2 can also regulate the transcription of corticotropinreleasing hormone by binding to its promoter. Corroborating the above fact, knockout studies in mice have shown that deletion of Brn- 2 affects the development of corticotropinreleasing hormone producing neurons in addition to oxytocin and vasopressin synthesizing neurons. In order to understand the genetic mechanisms involved in the development of zebrafish neuroendocrine hypothalamus, we attempted to characterize the developmental expression profile of brn 1. 2 and crh in zebrafish. Zebrafish crh gene has not been characterized before and only a partial sequence of brn 1. 2 was reported earlier. We screened the zebrafish EST database for brn 1. 2 and crh through a blast search and identified EST s for crh and brn 1. 2 that contained their full ORF. We used non-quantitative RT-PCR to analyze embryonic and post-embryonic expression pattern of crh. Expression of crh mRNA was detected from 1 dpf and it remained stable through 5 dpf. RT-PCR analysis of the tissues revealed strong expression of crh mRNA in the brain, eye, gills and weak expression in the testis. Spatial expression pattern of both the genes were analyzed by whole mount in situ hybridization. Expression of crh was detected in different parts of the embryonic brain including telencephalon, hypothalamus, posterior tuberculum, thalamus, preoptic area, epiphysis, midbrain tegmentum, hindbrain and in the retina. Localization of CRH transcripts in the preoptic area is consistent with its role as a hypophysiotropin in zebrafish. Zebrafish POU class III genes include brn 1. 2, zp 47, zp 12, zp 23 and zp 50. zp 47 and brn 1. 2 are found to be the direct homologs of the mammalian Brn- 2 gene. Expression of brn 1. 2 begins at tailbud stage. From 5 -somite stage on, brn 1. 2 is detected in the midbrain, hindbrain and weakly in the spinal cord. At 24 hpf brn 1. 2 is widely expressed in the diencephalon, midbrain and hindbrain but not detected in the telencephalon. At later stages of development brn 1. 2 transcripts were found in the hypothalamus, preoptic area, ventral thalamus, dorsal thalamus, pretectum, tectum, cerebellum and hindbrain. Additionally, brn 1. 2 was also detected in the otic vesicle at 48 hpf. In this study we have described the developmental expression pattern of brn 1. 2 and crh. Future studies will include a complete analysis of the function of brn 1. 2 in the specification of the hypothalamic neurons and also identification of other candidate genes that are required for the development these neurons...|$|R

Moreover, EEG theta frequency activity is quite different in these groups. This study investigated the correlation between biomarkers and memory performance. Methods: EEG α 3 /α 2 power ratio and cortical thickness were computed in 74 adult subjects with prodromal Alzheimer’s disease. Twenty of these subjects also underwent assessment of blood perfusion by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Pearson’s r was used to assess the correlation between cortical thinning, brain perfusion, and memory impairment. Results: In the higher α 3 /α 2 frequency power ratio group, greater cortical atrophy and lower regional perfusion in the temporoparietal cortex was correlated with an increase in EEG theta frequency. Memory impairment was more pronounced in the magnetic resonance imaging group and SPECT groups. Conclusion: A high EEG upper/low alpha power ratio was associated with cortical thinning and less perfusion in the temporoparietal area. Moreover, atrophy and less regional perfusion were significantly correlated with memory impairment in subjects with prodromal Alzheimer’s disease. The EEG upper/lower alpha frequency power ratio could be useful for identifying individuals at risk for progression to Alzheimer’s dementia and may be of value in the clinical context.

40|$|In the {{community-based}} Amsterdam Study of the Elderly, {{a sample}} of 3, 778 nondemented persons, 65 - 84 yrs old, was divided into 2 cognitive categories: normal, and borderline and impaired. At baseline, {{the presence or absence}} of memory complaints was assessed with a single question. At follow-up, incident cases of Alzheimer's disease were diagnosed in a 2 -step procedure. After an average of 3. 2 yrs, 2, 169 persons were reevaluated, of whom 77 had incident Alzheimer's disease. Analyses showed that memory complaints were associated with incident <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease in <b>Ss</b> with normal baseline cognition but not in Ss with impaired baseline cognition. Findings suggest that memory complaints are a relatively strong predictor of incident Alzheimer's disease in older persons in whom cognitive impairment is not yet apparent. Also, they suggest that older persons may be aware of a decline in cognition at a time when mental status tests are still unable to detect a decline from premorbid functioning.
