50|$|If the Committee {{finds that}} locally-proven {{technologies}} are available, it asks farmers experienced {{with the technology}} {{to help them with}} community-wide training. If however, Committee members <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> what will work locally, then they then work with their facilitator or extension agent to design an experiment that will compare several unproven solutions. These may be of local or external origin. Farmer Research Committee experiments typically begin with several treatments compared with local practice tested on a very small scale. Over time, the number of treatments is reduced {{and the size of the}} experimental plots is increased until one or more technologies are being validated at commercial scale. Committee experiments are usually replicated on the members own farms but the Committee members may also ask other farmers to join in and plant or evaluate experiments.|$|E

50|$|Tseng, a {{successful}} young politician, {{wants to start}} a family but his wife, Yi-hsi, opposes his decision because she has emotional problems and feels that she cannot accept the responsibility of motherhood. He manages to convince her to adopt a girl called Tien, but they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> the child's background. The girl behaves strangely and hardly speaks, except to a doll she carries with her all the time. Once, the housekeeper throws away the doll after it caused the washing machine to be jammed, but she is attacked by a strange force and ends up in hospital later. On another occasion in school, two boys try to bully Tien but the teacher, Ms Chung, finds the bullies tied up together by red strings later. The horrified bullies claim that Tien's doll was the one who tied them up. Ms Chung's mother, a spiritualist, begins to have visions about Tien and she manages to unravel the mystery. Tien comes from a broken family and her elder brother, You, {{was the only one who}} cared about her.
