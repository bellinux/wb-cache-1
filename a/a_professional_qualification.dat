5|$|Turunen {{enrolled}} in 2000 at the German music university Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe to gain <b>a</b> <b>professional</b> <b>qualification</b> as a soloist with further specialization in art song. In {{addition to the}} good reputation of the university, Turunen chose to go to Karlsruhe because some people at the Finnish university did not take her seriously as a classical singer due to her commitment in a metal band. While there, she recorded vocals for Nightwish's 2002 album Century Child and for Beto Vázquez Infinity. As with the other albums, Holopainen wrote the pieces and sent Turunen the lyrics and a demo recording of the prerecorded instrumental tracks by mail. Using the demo, Turunen designed her vocal lines and the choral passages.|$|E
