5|$|Gerald Fischbach {{spent nine}} {{years at the}} Washington University School of Medicine, where he served as the Edison Professor of Neurobiology and Head of the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology. During his time here, Fischbach {{continued}} {{his work on the}} ARIA protein. When ARIA isolated from chick embryo brain was applied to chicken myotubes, which are developing chicken muscle fibers, it was shown to increase the rate of insertion of acetylcholine receptors into chicken myotube membranes. This indicated ARIA could play a role in <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptor</b> insertion in neuromuscular junctions. Additionally, it was demonstrated that ARIA stimulated the transcription of α <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptor</b> subunits leading to an increase in α subunit messenger RNA (mRNA) and precursors, but had no effect on the mRNA levels of the γ or δ <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptor</b> subunits. This indicated that the amount α <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptor</b> subunit limits the synthesis and subsequent insertion of acetylcholine receptors into chicken myotube membranes.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{preclinical}} {{research with}} animal and human proteins, bupropion {{has been characterized}} as a weak norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It has also been found {{to act as a}} releasing agent of dopamine and norepinephrine (NDRA), similarly to other cathinones. However, when ingested orally by humans, bupropion is extensively converted in the body into several active metabolites with differing activities and influences on the effects of the drug during first-pass metabolism. These metabolites are present in much higher concentrations in the body compared to bupropion itself. The most important example is the major metabolite of bupropion, hydroxybupropion, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (and likely releasing agent) and nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptor</b> (nAChR) antagonist that lacks significant dopaminergic actions, and which, with oral bupropion treatment, can reach area under the curve (AUC) plasma concentrations that are as much as 16–20times greater than those of bupropion itself. Hence, the effects of bupropion cannot be understood unless its metabolism is also considered.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray and its relatives {{are used as}} model organisms for biomedical research, because their electric organs contain an abundance of important nervous system proteins such as nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptor</b> and acetylcholinesterase. In the 1970s and 1980s, acetylcholine receptors from this species and the marbled {{electric ray}} (T.marmorata) became the first neurotransmitter receptors to be isolated and sequenced, in what {{is considered to be}} a landmark success in the field of neurobiology. This led to a number of further advances, one of the most significant being the elucidation of the pathophysiology underlying the disease myasthenia gravis. A small commercial fishery in southern California supplies Pacific electric rays for research purposes; as of 2005 this fishery may have employed as few as two fishers. Otherwise, this ray has no economic value. It is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries, and on hook-and-line by sport anglers. These activities appear to have little impact on its population, leading it to be listed under Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Fishing for this ray is not managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council.|$|E

40|$|Antibodies in the sera of {{patients}} with myasthenia gravis are believed {{to play an important}} role in the pathogenesis of the disorder. They have recently been shown to accelerate the degradation of <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> in cultured mammalian skeletal muscle and at intact neuromuscular junctions. To elucidate the mechanism of the antibody-accelerated degradation process, we have prepared cultures in which one set of <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> was exposed to myasthenic immunoglobulin while a second set of <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors,</b> newly incorporated after exposure to the immunoglobulins, was not. The set of <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> with bound myasthenic immunoglobulin was degraded at 2 to 3 times the normal rate, while the second set of <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> without bound immunoglobulin was degraded at the control rate. This suggest that the binding of antibody from myasthenic patients alters the <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> in some way that causes them to be selected for preferential degradation by the muscle cells. New synthesis and incorporation of the acetyl-choline receptors into the surface membrane of cultured skeletal muscle was unaffected by exposure to myasthenic immunoglobulin...|$|R
5|$|There is no antidote, and {{supportive}} care is {{the mainstay of}} further treatment for intoxication. Though {{sometimes referred to as}} a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from A. muscaria and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptor</b> site, and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended. If a patient is delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures. Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol. Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required. Serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation. Hemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary. With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.|$|E
5|$|Fischbach {{began his}} {{research}} {{career at the}} National Institutes of Health, where {{he served as a}} senior surgeon at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) before becoming a fellow at the National Institute of Child Health from 1966 to 1973. Much of Fischbach’s research concentrated on the mechanisms controlling action potentials and synapses, from which he pioneered the use of neuron and muscle cell culture to study neuromuscular junctions. Fischbach used this technique to reconstruct neuromuscular junctions from dissociated spinal cord and muscle cells from chick embryos to show that functional synaptic connections reformed and were capable of sending spontaneous or induced action potentials. However, cultures containing isolated spinal cord cells were unable to send similar action potentials. This technique proved to be an important model for further studies to determine the essential mechanisms controlling neuromuscular junction development and maintenance. Towards the end of his tenure at the National Institutes of Health, Fischbach began to search for motor neuron molecules responsible for regulating the number of acetylcholine receptors on postsynaptic cells. This research project culminated in 1993 with the isolation of the ARIA (<b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptor</b> inducing activity) protein, which {{is a member of the}} neuregulin family and is responsible for stimulating the production of acetylcholine receptors in postsynaptic muscle tissue.|$|E

50|$|Myasthenia gravis {{occurs when}} <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> (nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> or AChRs) fail to {{function}} properly.

25|$|Metabolites of {{ketamine}} including dehydronorketamine, hydroxynorketamine, and norketamine {{have been}} found to act as negative allosteric modulators of the α7 nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptor</b> in the KXa7R1 cell line (HEK293 cells transfected with rat nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptor</b> genes) with subanesthetic and nanomolar potencies (e.g., IC50 = 55nM for dehydronorketamine), whereas ketamine itself was inactive at the same concentrations (< 1nbsp&µM). These findings suggest that metabolites may contribute importantly to the pharmacodynamics of ketamine.|$|E

40|$|Phylogenetic {{differences}} in <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> from skeletal neuromuscular synapses of various species of snakes and lizards have been investigated, using the snake venom alpha-neurotoxins alpha-atratoxin (cobrotoxin) and alpha-bungarotoxin. The <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> of the phylogenetically primitive lizards, like those {{from all other}} vertebrates previously tested, are blocked by these alpha-neurotoxins. In contrast, receptors from snakes and advanced lizards are insensitive to {{one or both of}} the toxins. It is suggested that toxin-resistant <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> appeared early in the evolution of Squamata and preceded the appearance of alpha-neurotoxins...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCyclic imine {{neurotoxins}} {{constitute an}} emergent family of neurotoxins of dinoflagellate origin that are potent antagonists of nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors.</b> We developed a target-directed functional method {{based on the}} mechanism of action of competitive agonists/antagonists of nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> {{for the detection of}} marine cyclic imine neurotoxins. The key step for method development was the immobilization of Torpedo electrocyte membranes rich in nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> on the surface of microplate wells and the use of biotinylated-α-bungarotoxin as tracer. Cyclic imine neurotoxins competitively inhibit biotinylated-α-bungarotoxin binding to Torpedo-nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> in a concentration-dependent manner. The microplate-receptor binding assay allowed rapid detection of nanomolar concentrations of cyclic imine neurotoxins directly in shellfish samples. Although highly sensitive and specific for the detection of neurotoxins targeting nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> as a class, the receptor binding assay cannot identify a given analyte. To address the low selectivity of the microplate-receptor binding assay, the cyclic imine neurotoxins tightly bound to the coated Torpedo nicotinic receptor were eluted with methanol, and the chemical nature of the eluted ligands was identified by mass spectrometry. The immobilization of Torpedo electrocyte membranes on the surface of microplate wells proved to be a high-throughput format for the survey of neurotoxins targeting nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> directly in shellfish matrixes with high sensitivity and reproducibility...|$|R
40|$|The rat {{nucleus accumbens}} {{contains}} acetylcholine-releasing interneurons, presumed {{to play a}} regulatory role in the electrical activity of medium spiny output neurons. In order to examine this issue in detail, we made electrophysiological recordings in rat nucleus accumbens slices. These experiments showed that γ-aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibition of the output neurons might be facilitated by activation of nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors,</b> {{in addition to being}} suppressed via activation of muscarinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors.</b> In contrast, glutamatergic excitation of output neurons appeared to be inhibited by activation of muscarinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> and to be insensitive to activation of nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors.</b> The spontaneous firing frequency of cholinergic neurons appeared to be under control of both a muscarinic and a nicotinic pathway in a bi-directional manner. Finally, we made paired recordings in which the functional connection between cholinergic neurons and output neurons was monitored. Driving the cholinergic neurons at physiological firing frequencies stimulated γ-aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibition of the output neurons, via activation of nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors.</b> The onset of this effect was slow and lacked a fixed delay. These data indicate that activation of nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> in rat nucleus accumbens may mediate the facilitation of γ-aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibition of medium spiny output neurons. Possible mechanisms of neurotransmission, mediating this cholinergic modulation are discussed...|$|R

25|$|MG is an {{autoimmune}} synaptopathy. The disorder {{occurs when}} the immune system malfunctions and generates antibodies that attack the body's tissues.

40|$|Nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> {{are members}} of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily, that {{includes}} also gamma-amino-butiric-acid(A), glycine, and 5 -hydroxytryptamine(3) <b>receptors.</b> Functional nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> result from the association of five subunits each contributing to the pore lining. The major neuronal nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> are heterologous pentamers of alpha 4 beta 2 subunits (brain), or alpha 3 beta 4 subunits (autonomic ganglia). Another class of neuronal receptors that are found both in the central and peripheral nervous system is the homomeric alpha 7 receptor. The muscle receptor subtypes comprise of alphabetadeltagamma (embryonal) or alphabetadeltaepsilon (adult) subunits. Although nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> are not directly involved in the hypnotic component of anesthesia, it is possible that modulation of central nicotinic transmission by volatile agents contributes to analgesia. The main effect of anesthetic agents on nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> is inhibitory. Volatile anesthetics and ketamine are the most potent inhibitors both at alpha 4 beta 2 and alpha 3 beta 4 receptors with clinically relevant IC(50) values. Neuronal nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> are more sensitive to anesthetics than their muscle counterparts, {{with the exception of the}} alpha 7 receptor. Several intravenous anesthetics such as barbiturates, etomidate, and propofol exert also an inhibitory effect on the nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors,</b> but only at concentrations higher than those necessary for anesthesia. Usual clinical concentrations of curare cause competitive inhibition of muscle nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> while higher concentrations may induce open channel blockade. Neuronal nAChRs like alpha 4 beta 2 and alpha 3 beta 4 are inhibited by atracurium, a curare derivative, but at low concentrations the alpha 4 beta 2 receptor is activated. Inhibition of sympathetic transmission by clinically relevant concentrations of some anesthetic agents is probably one of the factors involved in arterial hypotension during anesthesia...|$|R
