5|$|Best {{remembered the}} Indra as being <b>a</b> <b>depressing</b> {{place that was}} filled with a few tourists, and having heavy, old, red {{curtains}} that made it seem shabby compared to the larger Kaiserkeller, a club also owned by Koschmider and located nearby at 36 Grosse Freiheit. After the closure of the Indra because of complaints about the noise, the Beatles played in the Kaiserkeller, starting on 4 October 1960.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles first {{played a}} full show with Best on 17 August 1960 at the Indra club in Hamburg, {{and the group}} slept in the Bambi Kino cinema in a small, dirty room with bunk beds, a cold and noisy former {{storeroom}} directly behind the screen. Upon first seeing the Indra, where they were booked to play, Best remembered it as <b>a</b> <b>depressing</b> place filled with a few tourists, and having heavy, old, red curtains that made it seem shabby compared to the larger Kaiserkeller. As Best {{had been the only}} group member to study O-Level German at school, he could talk with the club's owner, Bruno Koschmider, and the clientele. After the Indra closed due to complaints about the noise, the group started a residency in the Kaiserkeller.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the younger version of Clarkson sitting at {{the back seat of}} a station wagon. Singing the first verse, she {{witnesses}} <b>a</b> <b>depressing</b> scene of her brother quarreling with her sister who are scolded by their mother. She slowly clasps both her hands before the video shifts to the present day where Clarkson is seen arriving on the red carpet with her publicist for the world premiere of The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. After posing for the photographers, she enters the cinema and watches the film. The next scene switches back to the younger Clarkson who is sitting and looking around her neighborhood at her house's rooftop as a plane is seen flying across the sky. The video switches back to the older Clarkson who is now watching the aforementioned film in her laptop inside the plane as it goes through a mild turbulence. Clarkson is also seen reminiscing about her past job as a worker in a movie theater, singing with her co-workers. The next scene shows Clarkson singing with her band in a backyard party which is shown alternately with scenes from the film, as well as a montage of her family and co-workers waving away from her. In the final scene, the younger Clarkson is shown praying by her bedside.|$|E
40|$|The {{correlation}} between depression and dysfunctional marital interaction is well documented, {{but only a}} few studies have examined gender-related differences in marital interaction patterns of couples with <b>a</b> <b>depressed</b> partner. In this paper we examined differences in observed marital communication in a sample of 62 Swiss couples presenting for treatment of depression. There were 16 maritally distressed couples with <b>a</b> <b>depressed</b> wife, 21 maritally nondistressed couples with <b>a</b> <b>depressed</b> wife, 18 maritally distressed couples with <b>a</b> <b>depressed</b> husband, and 7 maritally nondistressed couples with <b>a</b> <b>depressed</b> husband. Marital interaction behavior was found to depend on gender, depression, marital distress, as well as gender of the depressed partner. Our results suggest the need for a gender-sensitive model of the link between marital interaction and depression...|$|R

25|$|A morale {{boosting}} 5-wicket {{victory against}} South Australia followed. Allan Lamb and tour debutant James Whitaker hit centuries while spinner John Emburey found form. It also {{marked the end}} of <b>a</b> <b>depressing</b> run of fourteen losses for the England team (including Test and tour matches). Parkinson, another left-arm fast bowler, took 5/87 in England's first innings. Experts began to question England's vulnerability against left-arm fast bowling.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1940s, during <b>a</b> <b>depressing</b> lull in {{his career}} (his radio show Blue Ribbon Town had failed, he failed to sell his {{proposed}} sitcom The Flotsam Family only to see it become a huge hit as The Life of Riley with William Bendix in the title role, and the Marx Brothers as film performers were well past their prime), Groucho was scheduled to appear on a radio show with Bob Hope.

25|$|The Indian team's Test match averages and {{aggregates}} in <b>a</b> <b>depressing</b> series were a {{long way}} below those of the England players. Eight England team members who batted three or more times in the series averaged more than 50 runs per innings; three bowlers took 14 or more wickets and averaged less than 20 runs per wicket. Brian Statham had the unusual distinction of heading both batting and bowling averages, though his average of 70 with the bat reflected {{the fact that he}} was dismissed only once in three innings. Fred Trueman, scourge of the Indian cricket team in England in 1952, took most wickets with 24 at 16.70.|$|E
25|$|In {{place of}} Riesling, the easier {{cultivated}} Müller-Thurgau grape (14.7%) and other Riesling crossings like Kerner (4.6%) were planted {{in large quantities}} on the sites that were not suitable for Riesling, and which in many cases had been previously used for other agricultural purposes. A negative consequence of these large-scale plantings is that the wine produced from these sites are typically of a lower quality than Riesling wines {{which in turn has}} <b>a</b> <b>depressing</b> economic effect on the prices of all Mosel wines. While consumers have benefited with top quality Riesling wines being underpriced in comparison with some of the world's other great wines from places like Bordeaux, Burgundy and California, the economic hardship created by the prices has caused some of the smaller Mosel vineyards to go out of business.|$|E
25|$|By 1883 the {{membership}} of the SLP had fallen to an estimated 1500 members in just 30 Sections, <b>a</b> <b>depressing</b> atrophy which had led to the abandonment of the organization in April of that year even by its nominal head, Corresponding Secretary Philip Van Patten. Two individuals filled the role on a temporary basis {{for the rest of the}} year, culminating in the party's 4th National Convention in December 1883. There the 16 delegates, in an effort to forge links with non-party revolutionary socialists in an effort to keep them out of the camp of the rival anarchist movement, decided to steer the organization on a leftward course, curtaining the authority of the governing National Executive Committee and abolishing the centralizing post of Corresponding Secretary altogether in an effort to render the SLP a more decentralized organization amenable to the revolutionary left.|$|E

25|$|Barrington had flu at {{the start}} of the season, made <b>a</b> <b>depressing</b> pair against Derbyshire and withdrew from the First Test due to back trouble, which Australia won. He {{returned}} for the Second Test at Lord's and made a patient 75 after having retired hurt on 61 with a broken finger from Garth McKenzie. This stood him in good stead that evening when he turned the wrong way down a one-way street and was stopped by the police as after enquiries into his finger he was allowed to proceed. The Queen also asked about his finger when the teams were presented to her, as is traditional at Lord's. In freakish weather conditions including several stops for rain and a hailstorm that turned the ground white Australia were out for 78, but they survived the follow on as the weather forced a draw. The Third Test at Edgbaston was Cowdrey's 100th and he celebrated with a century, but Barrington was caught lbw by Eric Freeman and the game was another rained-off draw. Both Cowdrey and Bill Lawry we ill for the Fourth Test at Headingley, and the stand in captains settled for a third successive draw, with Barrington making 49 and 46 not out. Needing to win at the Oval to share the series the slow-scoring Barrington was dropped, but England won the Fifth Test with five minutes to spare. Barrington was named for the tour of South Africa in 1968–69, but this was cancelled when Basil d'Oliveira was belatedly included and the South African government refused to allow him to play.|$|E
500|$|For Rain or Shine (1930), Milton Ager and Jack Yellin {{composed}} [...] "Happy Days Are Here Again". The {{song was}} repeated sarcastically by characters in several {{films such as}} Under Eighteen (1931) and 20,000 Years in Sing Sing (1933). Less comical was {{the picture of the}} United States' future presented in Heroes for Sale that same year (1933), in which a hobo looks into <b>a</b> <b>depressing</b> night and proclaims, [...] "It's the end of America".|$|E
500|$|Much of the comic's {{dark humor}} {{is derived from}} its {{contrasts}} with Half-Life 2: in <b>a</b> <b>depressing,</b> dark vision of a conquered humanity's future, Gordon Freeman becomes a hero and savior; the similarly named Gordon Frohman, on the other hand, is just an average person, improbably cheerful {{to the point of}} stupidity, and somewhat naïve as to what is actually going on around him. [...] For instance, Frohman fails to realize that his return-addressed letters to Doctor Breen reveal his location, and so result in that location being invaded, bombed, or otherwise compromised.|$|E

500|$|City Lights {{had been}} a success, but Chaplin was unsure if he could make another picture without dialogue. He {{remained}} convinced that sound would not work in his films, but was also [...] "obsessed by <b>a</b> <b>depressing</b> fear of being old-fashioned." [...] In this state of uncertainty, early in 1931, the comedian {{decided to take a}} holiday and ended up travelling for 16 months. In his autobiography, Chaplin recalled that on his return to Los Angeles, [...] "I was confused and without plan, restless and conscious of an extreme loneliness". He briefly considered retiring and moving to China.|$|E
500|$|Karno {{selected}} his {{new star}} {{to join the}} section of the company, one that also included Stan Laurel, that toured North America's vaudeville circuit. The young comedian headed the show and impressed reviewers, being described as [...] "one of the best pantomime artists ever seen here". His most successful role was a drunk called the [...] "Inebriate Swell", which drew him significant recognition. The tour lasted 21 months, and the troupe returned to England in June 1912. Chaplin recalled that he [...] "had a disquieting feeling of sinking back into <b>a</b> <b>depressing</b> commonplaceness" [...] and was, therefore, delighted when a new tour began in October.|$|E
500|$|The Japanese struck first, {{landing at}} Buna in July, and at Milne Bay in August. The Australians repulsed the Japanese at Milne Bay, but {{a series of}} defeats in the Kokoda Track {{campaign}} had <b>a</b> <b>depressing</b> effect back in Australia. On 30 August, MacArthur radioed Washington that unless action was taken, New Guinea Force would be overwhelmed. He sent Blamey to Port Moresby to take personal command. Having committed all available Australian troops, MacArthur decided to send American forces. The 32nd Infantry Division, a poorly trained National Guard division, was selected. A series of embarrassing reverses in the Battle of Buna–Gona led to outspoken criticism of the American troops by the Australians. MacArthur then ordered Lieutenant General Robert L. Eichelberger to assume command of the Americans, and [...] "take Buna, or not come back alive." ...|$|E
40|$|<b>A</b> <b>depressed</b> {{scapular}} alignment {{could lead}} to prolonged and repetitive stress or compression of the brachial plexus, resulting in sensitization of neural tissue. However, no study has investigated the influence of alignment of the scapulae on sensitization of upper limb neural tissue in otherwise asymptomatic people. In this case-control study, we investigate the influence of <b>a</b> <b>depressed</b> scapular alignment on mechanosensitivity of the upper limb peripheral nervous system as well as pressure pain thresholds (PPT). Asymptomatic individuals with neutral vertical scapular alignment (n = 25) or depressed scapular alignment (n = 25) participated. We measured the upper limb neurodynamic test (ULNT 1), including assessment of symptom response and elbow range of motion (ROM), and PPT measured over upper limb peripheral nerve trunks, the upper trapezius muscle and overlying cervical zygapophyseal joints. Subjects with <b>a</b> <b>depressed</b> scapular reported significantly greater pain intensity (t = 5. 7, p < 0. 0001) and reduced elbow extension ROM (t = − 2. 7, p < 0. 01) during the ULNT 1 compared to those with a normal scapular orientation. Regardless of the location tested, the group presenting with <b>a</b> <b>depressed</b> scapular had significantly lower PPT compared to those with a normal scapular orientation (PPT averaged across all sites: normal orientation: 3. 3 ± 0. 6 kg/cm 2, depressed scapular: 2. 1 ± 0. 5 kg/cm 2, p < 0. 00001). Despite being asymptomatic, people with <b>a</b> <b>depressed</b> scapular have greater neck and upper limb neural tissue mechanosensitivity when compared to people with a normal scapular orientation. This study offers insight into the potential development of neck-arm pain due to <b>a</b> <b>depressed</b> scapular position. SIN FINANCIACIÓNNo data (2016) UE...|$|R

500|$|Allen revisits some of {{the themes}} he had {{explored}} in Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989), such as the existence of justice in the universe. Both films feature a murder of an unwanted mistress, and [...] "offer <b>a</b> <b>depressing</b> view on fate, fidelity, {{and the nature of}} man". That film's protagonist, Judah Rosenthal, is an affluent member of the upper-middle class having an extramarital affair. After he tries to break the affair off, his mistress blackmails him and threatens to go to his wife. Soon, Rosenthal decides to murder his mistress, but is racked with guilt over violating his moral code. Eventually, he learns to ignore his guilt and go on as though nothing has happened. Philip French compared the two films' plots and themes in The Observer, and characterised Match Points as a [...] "clever twist on the themes of chance and fate".|$|E
500|$|Reaction to {{the episode}} by news media {{organizations}} was extremely negative and caused controversy, criticizing the episode for its portrayal of domestic violence. A. J.

[...] In the same interview, Hammer asked television host Wendy Walsh of The Doctors about the storyline, to which she responded, [...] "The main theme of the show was about this poor 'stupid' woman who was too dumb to leave her relationship. And domestic violence is far more complicated than that. We're watching someone rationalize a domestic violence relationship {{and this is the}} kind of thought process that actually goes on in real life. It’s not satire anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|Pete Garceau {{designed}} the cover art for the American release, which one critic said was [...] "a {{thick layer of}} sugar-coated sweetness {{in an effort to}} not alarm potential readers.

[...] The Canadian version, designed by Ellen Cipriano, is similar to the American version but with a photo illustration rather than the disarming cartoon illustration. Cover art for the international releases contrast the natural environment with a decaying built environment. Adam Grupper voiced the ten-hour-long, unabridged English language audiobook which was published by Macmillan Audio and BBC Audiobooks, and released simultaneously with the hardcover book. AudioFile gave the audio presentation its Earphones Award, called Grupper's reading sincere and balanced, and wrote, [...] "Never veering into sensationalism, always objective and phlegmatic, Grupper takes what could be <b>a</b> <b>depressing</b> topic and makes it a book you just can't stop listening to".|$|E
