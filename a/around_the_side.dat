25|$|The most upscale residences are the townhouses {{found on}} Franklin Square, Church and Woodlawn streets and {{portions}} of Clinton and Van Dam streets. Usually two stories tall, they show the greatest {{attention to the}} forms of popular contemporary styles and the most elaborate ornamentation, sometimes including surfaces of brick or stone in sections. They often have a generous setback from the street and a porch, sometimes wrapping <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1953 and 1954, Bel Airs {{could be}} ordered in convertible, hardtop coupe, two- and four-door sedans, and, for 1954, the Beauville station wagon which {{featured}} woodgrain trim <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> windows. Many new options, once {{available only to}} more expensive luxury cars, became offered starting in 1953, including power steering and the Guidematic headlight dimmer in 1953; and power brakes, power 2-way front seat and power front windows in 1954. All 1954 models equipped with the standard transmission used the 1953 Powerglide engine.|$|E
25|$|The track {{climbs up}} through the forest. On the {{northern}} {{side of the mountain}} there is no bamboo zone, so the forest gradually turns into moorland covered with giant heather. The track ends at Old Moses Camp and becomes a path. This continues up the hill before splitting into two routes. To the left, the least used path goes <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the Barrow, to Likii North Hut. The vegetation becomes more sparse, with giant lobelia and groundsels dotted around. The path climbs over a ridge, before rejoining the main path ascending the Mackinder Valley. Shipton's Cave {{can be found in the}} rock wall to the left of the steep path just before reaching Shipton's Camp.|$|E
500|$|After {{his request}} {{to return to}} the fleet was approved, Basilone was {{assigned}} to [...] "C" [...] Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Marine Regiment, 5th Marine Division. On February 19, 1945, the first day of invasion of Iwo Jima, he was serving as a machine gun section leader on Red Beach II. While the Marines landed, the Japanese concentrated their fire at the incoming Marines from heavily fortified blockhouses staged throughout the island. With his unit pinned down, Basilone made his way <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the Japanese positions until he was directly on top of the blockhouse. He then attacked with grenades and demolitions, single-handedly destroying the entire strong point and its defending garrison.|$|E

500|$|The {{powerful}} central {{light source}} creates a chiaroscuro effect. The light illuminating the scene {{has been described}} as [...] "so brilliant it could only be the light of revelation". The single source of light is obscured behind the bowl on the table; some hint of a lamp glass can be seen <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the bowl, but David Hockney has suggested that the bowl itself may contain sulphur, giving a powerful single light source that a candle or oil lamp would not. In the earlier study a candle holder is visible, and the flame is reflected in the bowl. Hockney believes that many of the Old Masters used optical equipment to assist in their painting, and suggests that Wright may have used lenses to transfer the image to paper rather than painting directly from the scene, as he believes the pattern of shadows thrown by the lighting could have been too complicated for Wright to have captured so accurately without assistance. It may be observed, however, that the stand on which the pump is situated casts no shadow on the body of the philosopher, as it could be expected to do.|$|E
2500|$|This {{article was}} sparked {{because of a}} chance {{encounter}} on the ice near Resolute, in the Canadian Arctic {{in the autumn of}} 1983. According to Kenn Harper he met a man wearing a hat with bold letters <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the hat saying [...] "HANS ISLAND, N.W.T." [...] This man was a scientist with Dome Petroleum who had just spent the summer on the island doing ice research. Dome Petroleum did research on and around the island from 1980 to 1983.|$|E

2500|$|SR 26 {{begins at}} the {{intersection}} of Pike Street and Acme Street in Marietta. Pike Street is also designated SR 7. In 2014, the previous routing for SR 26 through Marietta was abandoned and SR 26 was rerouted onto Acme Street. After following Acme Street for about 1,000ft, SR 26 turns east onto Greene Street. The route heads <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of a hill before passing under Interstate 77 and crossing the Duck Creek, SR 26 heads into more hilly terrain generally following valleys formed by streams and rivers. Upon entering the Wayne National Forest, the route generally parallels the Little Muskingum River. About [...] from the terminus, SR 26 encounters its first state highway, SR 260. SR 26 and SR 260 form a [...] concurrency. Upon exiting Washington County and entering Monroe County, SR 26 heads in a more northerly direction and no longer parallels the Little Muskingum River. After intersecting SR 537's eastern terminus, SR 26 climbs a hill and passes through the village of Graysville. After briefly following the Little Muskingum River again, SR 26 reaches SR 800 and the two routes together head north towards Woodsfield. In Woodsfield, SR 26 and SR 800 travel along Main Street, exit the Wayne National Forest, and intersect SR 78 (Court Street) in the center of town.|$|E
