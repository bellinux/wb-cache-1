25|$|The 2008–09 season {{preparations}} began {{much earlier}} than past seasons, with Perth Glory going on a three-game tour of China in March, consisting of matches against Changchun Yatai, Changsha Ginde and Guangzhou. The tour {{was used as an}} opportunity for the club to assess potential signings, including state league players Josip Magdić (Floreat Athena), Mark Lee, (footballer, now coach at Pro Football Training) (ECU Joondalup), Callum Roberts (Fremantle) and Marc Anthony (Stirling Lions). Eugene Dadi, whose mooted move to the Glory last season was stalled due to Hapoel Acre's refusal to release him, also made the trip. The Glory lost all three matches; the first match went to Changchun 3–0, the second match to Changsha 2–0 and Guangzhou won the final game 3–1. Callum Roberts scored the Glory's only goal on the tour. Perth Glory also made four new signings in their off-season. Eugene Dadi was granted release from his former club to sign for Perth Glory. Adriano Pellegrino and Adrian Trinidad joined the club in early May. Jimmy Downey also had his contract extended by a further year. Josip Magdić and Naum Sekulovski had also re-joined the Glory for season 2008/09. Stan Lazaridis is the most notable departure, having been told by the club he is no longer required after two seasons hampered by injury, suspension and poor form. In July 2008, Glory announced the signing of Brazilian international midfielder Amaral. The defensive midfielder has played with some of the great clubs around the globe including Brazilian giants Palmeiras and Corinthians, perennial Portuguese championship contenders Benfica and successful Italian Serie A outfits Parma and Fiorentina. He has also represented Brazil 31 times during a long and successful career before joining Perth on their pre-season tour of Indonesia. Glory had been keeping a close eye on youngsters Scott Bulloch (Sorrento), Anthony Skorić (Western Knights) and Andrija Jukić (Perth SC) who were <b>all</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> coming players in the WA State league. Bulloch signed with the Glory's senior team in August, while Skorić and Jukić joined Glory's Youth Team. In September, Wayne Srhoj returned to Australia after five seasons in Romania, to sign with the Glory {{for the rest of the}} season. Perth finished the season in 7th place, with 22 points. Glory once again started the season poor, though they did however finish the second half of the season strongly, winning 4 matches and drawing 3, securing 15 points in the last 11 rounds since November. In November, Head Coach Dave Mitchell signed a contract extension securing his services till the end of the 2010/11 season. Mitchell's contract extension, despite Glory's slow start, showed the new direction Glory's club was heading, of vision, but built on stable foundations. Promising signs on and off the field were shown this season and things progressed further with Tony Sage taking sole ownership of the club at season's end.|$|E

The following year, on 18 October 2008, Coulter's publicist issued a statement that they had separated due to [...] "distance and time apart". In an interview with Herald Suns Jonathan Moran, {{three years after the}} marriage ended, Coulter revealed that she had experienced depression during her relationship with Babbington. [...] "I was living my dream but behind closed doors my personal life was a mess. [...] I felt alone, I bottled it <b>all</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> it made things worse. I wanted to give up everything. I wouldn't leave the house for days at a time. I'd sit in the house all day and do nothing".|$|E
500|$|Henry Jackman {{returned}} from Winter Soldier to score the sequel. He found {{the movie to}} be tonally different from the previous one, which necessitated a much more symphonic and orchestral score. This culminates in the final fight between Captain America, Winter Soldier, and Iron Man, the music for which Jackman described as [...] "somewhat operatic and ... almost classical in its style". Though Jackman reprised and developed his themes for Captain America and the Winter Soldier from the previous film, and introduced motifs for the new characters Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Zemo, he was wary of pushing the audience {{to one side of}} the central conflict or the other by using character-specific music; Jackman composed a new main theme for the film to represent the Civil War, [...] "a generic theme to balance everything out", [...] "toward which all the characters can gravitate. It wrapped them <b>all</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> it helped to bind the movie together rather than do endless disparate themes." [...] Jackman also wrote a thriller theme that appears whenever the mystery surrounding Zemo's plan is explored. This was inspired by the works of Jerry Goldsmith. The score was released on a soundtrack album by Hollywood Records on May 6, 2016.|$|E

[...] A bootleg album of the concert appeared, under the title JL-YO-EC, thanks to an audience recording, which was released {{a few months after the}} official album. After Lennon's death, the album, along with seven other Lennon albums, was reissued by EMI as part of a box set, which was released in the UK on 15 June 1981. The album was reissued in the US in 1982, on Capitol, and again in the same country on the same label, in 1986. The album was originally scheduled to appear on CD for the first time in June 1989, but the plan was scrapped. Ono, with the help of Rob Stevens from Quad Recording, supervised a remixing of Live Peace in Toronto 1969 for its compact disc issue, released on 1 May 1995. Two of the remixed tracks feature a variation in Ono's vocals: while [...] "Dizzy Miss Lizzy" [...] has additional backing vocals from Ono, [...] "Money" [...] has fewer backing vocals from Ono. The CD booklet included a 1995 calendar, mimicking the original release. The album is also available from the audiophile label Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab., utilizing the same remix. The booklet for the 2006 Mobile Fidelity release also included a current calendar.|$|E
500|$|Crash's {{aesthetic}} {{design in}} the games developed by Radical Entertainment has received mixed reactions from reviewers. Brian Rowe of Game Revolution noted that Crash's fingerless gloves have been replaced with [...] "equally outdated" [...] tribal tattoos and that Crash's personality had been altered from his [...] "obnoxiously extreme attitude" [...] {{to that of a}} [...] "bluthering, googly-eyed idiot". Although Rowe wondered when and why the change happened, he concluded that [...] "it's better than the popular goatee-of-rage that so many other platform giants are sporting these days". Arnold Katayev of PSX Extreme, while admitting that the character detail on Crash was [...] "pretty nice", expressed unhappiness with the artistic choices made for the character; he described Crash's tribal tattoos as [...] "a little pretentious" [...] and noted that the increased definition on his mohawk patch made Crash come off as [...] "trying too hard to be cool". He added that Crash's new fighting style begot a stance that consists of Crash [...] "putting up his dukes like a boxer", which he deemed [...] "out of character" [...] for Crash. Finally, while critiquing the voice acting in Crash of the Titans, he remarked that Crash [...] "especially sounds awful, largely because he doesn't actually speak - he just blabs annoying gibberish, which makes him sound like he's an infant". Matt Keller of PALGN also criticized Crash's voice, which he said made Crash sound [...] "like a confused baby". Louis Bedigian of GameZone stated that [...] "Crash's character design has gone from cool to goofy and now to the dreaded place of being dorky" [...] and said that the minute and gradual changes made to Crash's design throughout the series [...] "have really hurt Crash's appearance as a leading game character". GamePro named Crash's new design as the second worst video game character makeover ever. Craig Harris of IGN was more positive on Crash's new appearance and noted that Crash [...] "looks a little floofier and a lot edgier, gaining a spikier Mohawk and trading in his fingerless gloves for tribal ink <b>all</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down his arms" [...] while comparing his incoherent squawking vocalizations to Kazooie of the Banjo-Kazooie series. He concluded that [...] "ultimately he's been changed for the better. He looks a little cooler and more appealing than his more 'Japanese-inspired' edits over the years".|$|E

He referred to Ludwig van Beethoven, who had a lot of worries, but wrote more and more beautiful music.

2500|$|Concerning {{the central}} {{conflict}} of the film, Jackman {{found that he}} was in [...] "constant danger of tipping it too much" [...] and pushing the audience to one side or the other, so he composed a new main theme for the film to represent that Civil War, which he called [...] "a generic theme to balance everything out", and [...] "a narrative theme toward which all the characters can gravitate. It wrapped them <b>all</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> it helped to bind the movie together rather than do endless disparate themes." [...] The second major theme in the film is a thriller theme, that appears whenever the central mystery surrounding several character's pasts and Zemo's plan is teased or explored. It consists of a flute motif tied to the Winter Soldier's Russian handlers and a rising adagio that represents Zemo's twisted determination, and was inspired by the works of Jerry Goldsmith. Of the character themes from previous films that Jackman did use, [...] "where appropriate", he evolved them to fit the tone and style of the new score. Captain America's theme could not be too prominent or heroic, as that would suggest that he was the hero of the film when the Russos were trying to create an ambiguity surrounding the main conflict—this does change throughout the film though, becoming more heroic when Captain America [...] "turns out to be right all along". For the Winter Soldier, Jackman took a [...] "rising string rhyme" [...] that was buried underneath [...] "the chaos and the industrial stuff" [...] in the end of the character's suite from The Winter Soldier, and developed that into a much more symphonic theme for the character, in keeping with his much more human portrayal in this film.|$|E
2500|$|The Tom Leykis Show had {{its last}} regular {{terrestrial}} broadcast on Friday, February 20, 2009, and ended at 5 p.m., {{the middle of}} its usual time slot. Leykis took calls until the last five minutes. At that point, the host mentioned that people had {{asked him how he}} was going to end the show. Saying [...] "Let's tell the truth", Leykis commented that he knew since the previous summer that it was possible the flagship station (KLSX, which originated the broadcast of the show) would switch format. Saying he [...] "tossed and turned", he thought about it and asked himself: [...] "What could I say that would wrap this <b>all</b> <b>up?</b> <b>And</b> then I one day heard this song … and I realized – the lyrics of this song … are about me." [...] With that, Leykis rolled into Joe Jackson's [...] "I'm the Man" [...] (the title track of Jackson's 1979 album). By the time the song was over, the studio was filled with people—as could be seen by the live online video broadcast on the station website. The host thanked his producers, the program director, the crowd in the studio, and everyone in southern California who made it [...] "12 great years", and he finished with [...] "Let's do this thing one more time..." [...] The crowd yelled [...] "Blow me up, Tom" [...] one last time to end the show and mark the end of KLSX as [...] "The FM Talk Station" [...] in what coincidentally became a strikingly appropriate catch phrase to be had: The phrase [...] "blow up the station" [...] is a radio term for ending a particular format or station run. After a much longer than usual explosion sound effect, the crowd cheered and KLSX changed format from hot talk to CHR/Top 40.|$|E
