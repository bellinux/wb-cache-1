5|$|Now back in Austria, Metternich {{witnessed}} {{first hand}} the Austrian army's defeat at the Battle of Wagram. Stadion tendered his resignation <b>as</b> <b>Foreign</b> Minister in the aftermath, and the Emperor immediately offered the post to Metternich. Metternich, worried that Napoleon would seize on this to demand harsher peace terms, instead agreed {{to become a}} minister of state (which he did on 8 July) and to lead negotiations with the French on the understanding that he would replace Stadion <b>as</b> <b>Foreign</b> Minister at a later date. During peace talks at Altenburg, Metternich put forward pro-French proposals to save the Austrian monarchy. Napoleon, however, disliked {{his position on the}} future of Poland, and Metternich was gradually displaced from the proceedings by Prince Liechtenstein. He soon regained influence, however, on 8 October, <b>as</b> <b>Foreign</b> Minister (and additionally that of Minister of the Imperial Household). In early 1810 Metternich's earlier affair with Junot became public but, because of Eleonore's understanding, the scandal was minimal.|$|E

5|$|After {{the sudden}} and {{unexpected}} death of Carneiro Leão in September 1856, his cabinet only {{managed to survive}} him by a few months. The Emperor, although critical {{of the way the}} Conciliation had been implemented, had learned to appreciate its merits and was eager that it continue. PedroII's support gave the Conciliation another chance, and allowed Paranhos to return to government once more <b>as</b> <b>Foreign</b> Minister on 12 December 1858. The most pressing issue facing Paranhos was the Paraguayan government's persistent refusal to allow Brazilian ships access to Mato Grosso province. At that time, the best and fastest way to reach that distant Brazilian province was to travel via the Atlantic and from there up the rivers which flow between the nations south of Brazil. One of the reasons for Brazil's war against Argentina in 1851 was to assure the free passage of its ships. The crisis between Brazil and Paraguay had dragged on since Paranhos's tenure <b>as</b> <b>Foreign</b> Minister in Carneiro Leão's cabinet. On 12 February 1858, Paranhos signed a treaty with Paraguay which allowed Brazilian ships unrestricted navigation of Paraguayan rivers. This prevented the outbreak of war—or at least deferred the conflict until 1864.|$|E
