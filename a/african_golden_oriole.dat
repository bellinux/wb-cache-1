50|$|The Indian <b>golden</b> <b>oriole</b> (Oriolus kundoo) is {{a species}} of oriole found in the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia. The species was {{formerly}} {{considered to be a}} subspecies of the Eurasian <b>golden</b> <b>oriole,</b> but is now considered a full species. Adults can be told apart from the Eurasian <b>golden</b> <b>oriole</b> by the black of the eye stripe extending behind the eye.|$|R
50|$|The Eurasian <b>golden</b> <b>oriole</b> {{or simply}} <b>golden</b> <b>oriole</b> (Oriolus oriolus) {{is the only}} member of the oriole family of {{passerine}} birds breeding in Northern Hemisphere temperate regions.

50|$|Formerly, the Indian <b>golden</b> <b>oriole</b> was {{considered}} as a subspecies of the Eurasian <b>golden</b> <b>oriole</b> until split in 2011 based on differences in morphology, plumage, calls {{and the fact that}} the two do not intergrade.

50|$|The orioles are a mainly {{tropical}} group, {{although one}} species, the Eurasian <b>golden</b> <b>oriole,</b> breeds in temperate regions.|$|R
50|$|The Indian <b>golden</b> <b>oriole</b> is {{very similar}} to the Eurasian <b>golden</b> <b>oriole</b> but has more yellow in the tail and has a paler shade of red in the iris and bill. The male has the black eye stripe {{extending}} behind the eye, a large carpal patch on the wing and wide yellow tips to the secondaries and tertiaries. The streaks on the underside of females is more sharp than in the females of the Eurasian <b>golden</b> <b>oriole.</b> The European species is larger with a wing length of 149-162 mm in adult males compared to 136-144 mm in O. kundoo. The wing formula is also different with primary 2 longer than 5 in O. oriolus while primary 5 is longer than 2 in O. kundoo.|$|R

5000|$|Like all New World orioles, {{this species}} {{is named after}} an unrelated, {{physically}} similar family found in the Old World: the Oriolidae. [...] "Oriole" [...] ultimately derives from Latin aureolus, [...] "golden". The genus name Icterus is from Ancient Greek ikteros, a yellow bird, usually taken to be the Eurasian <b>golden</b> <b>oriole,</b> the sight of which was thought to cure jaundice. The specific galbula is the Latin name for a yellow bird, again usually assumed to be the <b>golden</b> <b>oriole.</b>|$|R
50|$|Species seen in Poland: red-backed shrike, corncrake, <b>golden</b> <b>oriole,</b> hawfinch, white stork, aquatic warbler, white-winged black terns, great snipe, flycatchers (pied, spotted, {{collared}} and red-breasted).|$|R
50|$|The Indian <b>golden</b> <b>oriole</b> inhabits a {{range of}} {{habitats}} including open deciduous forests, semi-evergreen forests, woodland, forest edge, mangroves, open country with scattered trees, parks, gardens orchards and plantations.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "oriole" [...] {{was first}} {{recorded}} (in the Latin form oriolus) by Albertus Magnus in about 1250, and was stated to be onomatopoeic, from {{the song of}} the <b>golden</b> <b>oriole.</b>|$|R
50|$|The black-naped oriole (Oriolus chinensis) is a bird of the oriole {{family and}} {{is found in}} many parts of Asia. There are several {{distinctive}} populations within the wide distribution range of this species and in the past the slender-billed oriole (Oriolus tenuirostris) was included as a subspecies. Unlike the Indian <b>golden</b> <b>oriole</b> which only has a short and narrow eye-stripe, the black-naped oriole has the stripe broadening and joining {{at the back of the}} neck. Males and females are very similar although the wing lining of the female is more greenish. The bill is pink and is stouter than in the <b>golden</b> <b>oriole.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are various}} bird species. The <b>golden</b> <b>oriole,</b> nightingale, Sardinian warbler, whitethroat, common blackbird, Eurasian jay, common {{chaffinch}} {{nest in the}} reserve, as well as different species of falcons, woodpeckers and many others.|$|R

40|$|We report {{densities of}} spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) and <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf (Canis anthus) in Enderta {{district}} in northern Ethiopia with high human and low natural prey densities. We estimated spotted hyaena and <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf abundance and characterized their spatial distribution with three methods: we surveyed four road-transects for 66 nights during dry (n= 41) and wet (n= 25) seasons, we used 34 calling stations and we mapped all active spotted hyaena dens {{at the time}} of the survey. The density of spotted hyaena and <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf increased with proximity to towns where human density was higher. A total of 562 spotted hyaena and 63 <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf responded to calling stations, leading to estimates of 1, 145 spotted hyaena and 166 <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf in Enderta district. This method also found a significantly higher spotted hyaena and <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf abundance in high human density areas. Maximum response radius was 2. 8 km for spotted hyaena and 2. 5 km for <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf, and response probability was 0. 83 for spotted hyaena and 0. 8 for <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf, respectively. We found 40 active spotted hyaena dens with 1, 507 remnants of prey, and the majority of the dens were located close to rivers and villages. Our findings show a positive relationship between spotted hyaena, <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf and human concentrations that might demonstrate a case of exceptional coexistence of humans and carnivores, both at high densities. We suggest further investigations into co-adaptations between humans and predators in the study area...|$|R
50|$|The forested {{areas are}} home to such animal species as Bonelli's eagle, golden eagle, short-toed snake eagle, common bent-wing bat, finch and greenfinch, whilst the fruit trees are host to such species as titmice, sparrow, blackbird, <b>golden</b> <b>oriole,</b> wren, nightingale, Cetti's warbler and wagtail, among others.|$|R
50|$|The genus name Icterus as used by {{classical}} authors, {{referred to}} a bird with yellow or green plumage. In modern times this {{has been identified as}} the <b>golden</b> <b>oriole.</b> Brisson re-applied the name to the New World birds because of their similarity in appearance.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} {{flying lizard}} has many predators including arboreal snakes and birds. Two species of bird {{that have been}} observed to feed on them include the Indian <b>golden</b> <b>oriole</b> and the black-capped kingfisher. Lion-tailed macaques have been noted to feed on them as well.|$|R
50|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{history of this}} group of orioles is complex {{and there may be}} more cryptic species within the group. The subspecies are very closely related and the group forms a clade in which the Eurasian <b>oriole</b> and Indian <b>golden</b> <b>oriole</b> are also nested.|$|R
5000|$|The yellow-throated vireo (Vireo flavifrons) {{is a small}} American songbird."Vireo" [...] is a Latin word {{referring}} to a green migratory bird, perhaps the female <b>golden</b> <b>oriole,</b> possibly the European greenfinch. The specific flavifrons is from the Latin words flavus, [...] "yellow", and frons, [...] "forehead".|$|R
50|$|The {{classification}} and phylogenetic {{relationships of}} the <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> cat has remained in dispute. It {{has historically been}} placed under Catopuma, Felis or Profelis. However, studies in 2006 and 2009 have showed that the <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> cat has a particularly {{close relationship with the}} caracal (Caracal caracal). These two species, together with the serval (Leptailurus serval), form one of the eight lineages of Felidae. This lineage evolved nearly 8.5 Mya. More recently, the <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> cat has been considered a species of Caracal. The <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> cat resembles the Asian golden cat, but are not closely related.|$|R
