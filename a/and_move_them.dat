5|$|Although {{the player}} has no direct {{control over the}} patients, they have some {{influence}} over whether to evict them from the hospital and in determining {{what to do with}} them when given a choice by the staff. The player can pick up any staff member in the building <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>them</b> (mainly to reassign them to another room or send them to get rest), or dismiss them if they argue about pay or are no longer required. The player may force patients to take a chance at a cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis is complete (at the risk of killing the patient), and rearrange queues.|$|E
5|$|Takanohana was the {{youngest}} ever {{to reach the top}} division at just 17, and he set a number of other age-related records. He had a solid but aggressive style, looking to get a right hand grip on his opponents' mawashi <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>them</b> quickly out of the ring. He won over half his bouts by a straightforward yori-kiri, or force out. In his later career he suffered increasingly from injuries, and he retired in January 2003 at the age of 30. He is now the head coach of Takanohana stable and {{a senior member of the}} Japan Sumo Association.|$|E

5|$|By 1943, the Japanese {{maintained}} separate {{army and}} navy headquarters at Rabaul which cooperated {{with each other}} but were responsible to different higher authorities. Naval forces came under the Southeast Area Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral Jinichi Kusaka. Army forces came under General Hitoshi Imamura's Eighth Area Army, consisting of the XVII Army in the Solomon Islands, Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi's XVIII Army in New Guinea, and the 6th Air Division, based at Rabaul. As {{a result of the}} destruction of a convoy carrying reinforcements in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, the Japanese decided not send any more convoys to Lae, but instead to land troops at Hansa Bay and Wewak <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>them</b> forward to Lae by barge or submarine. In the long run they hoped to complete a road over the Finisterre Range and thence to Lae through the Ramu and Markham Valleys.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} from injury {{in time for}} the start of the 2001–02 season and once again he became an established member of the team during the start of the campaign. He was dropped from the side for a period of time following an FA Cup defeat to Northampton Town in November 2001, during which he missed an open goal. He returned to the first team in January 2002 and scored on his second game back in the starting eleven as Torquay defeated Bristol Rovers. Two months later, he scored a vital goal in a 2–0 victory over Lincoln City, which helped Torquay to only their second home victory in four months <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>them</b> 13points clear of the relegation zone. Torquay finished the season only two places higher than their previous campaign, but 15points above relegated Halifax Town. During his disrupted three seasons with Torquay, Brandon amassed 83appearances with ten goals to his credit, before he moved to Chesterfield in July 2002 on a free transfer.|$|E

5|$|The Las Vegas {{situation}} {{was one of}} a bevy of developments that absorbed the league in the 1994 to 1995 offseason. The team was not officially disbanded until April 1995 but not before the league damaged its credibility by twice giving provisional approval to a relocation to Jackson, Mississippi, {{to the point where the}} Mississippi team was included on the 1995 internal schedule and had hired a general manager and coaching staff, only to have the deal collapse amid squabbles with the Las Vegas corporation that owned the Posse. A group from Miami, Florida tried to convince the league to let it buy the remains of the Posse <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>them</b> to South Florida as the Miami Manatees in the Miami Orange Bowl. An exhibition game between Birmingham and Baltimore was held there in June 1995 to gauge support, which drew a decent crowd just above 20,000.|$|E
25|$|Before 1795 {{the town}} on the island was called Sherburne. The {{original}} settlement was near Capaum Pond. At that time the pond was a small harbor, whose entrance silted up, forcing the settlers to dismantle their houses, <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>them</b> northeast by two miles to the present location.|$|E
25|$|The chosen {{location}} {{was occupied by}} an open-air market {{that had been in}} continuous operation since 1853. After loud complaints and much negotiation, the railroad agreed to purchase the markets for $1million <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>them</b> to a new structure: the Reading Terminal Market, located to the rear (north) of the headhouse at 12th and Filbert Streets. This required the trainshed and all of its tracks to be constructed one story above street level, with the Ninth Street Branch to bring trains in and out.|$|E
50|$|In November 2011, Colombian {{entrepreneur}} Carlos Mejía {{bought the}} Tecolotes de Nuevo Laredo <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>them</b> to Campeche, giving the state two baseball teams alongside the Piratas de Campeche.|$|R

25|$|The video {{starts with}} Lightbody, {{who wears a}} dark coat, a grey polo neck sweater, and trousers. He sings as he pushes an old {{motorcycle}} across a farmer's field at dusk. As darkness falls, he abandons the bike and enters a wood. He walks through it, until he descends a short hill and stays in a stream. As the chorus begins, Lightbody lights a distress firelight, he moves it in circles as he sings. In a bridge behind him, two members from Snow Patrol light two flares <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>them</b> as well. When the chorus ends, Lighbody throws his flare to the water, in which it continues shining. Lightbody returns to the forest and he sings while he walks. Later, he ascends to a plain, where another two members ignite two distress firelights as the second verse ends. With the flares, they run <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>them</b> in circles, and then, they throw them to each other. Nathan Connolly, who wears a grey hoodie, appears riding the motorcycle Lightbody dumped. He drives it in zigzag with the other men. As the video ends, {{he goes to the}} stream, where the motorbike starts to throw smoke; Connolly gets off it, and it fires. The burning bike rolls downhill and it falls into the stream, where it sinks, with the fire being extinguished.|$|E
25|$|During the Build Phase the {{two teams}} are {{restricted}} to their own side of the map and cannot use any weapons. The only equipment is the Gravity Gun, used to freeze and unfreeze blocks, pick them up <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>them.</b> Each side has access to {{a limited number of}} blocks (default of 50, but can be set to any value), which can be spawned (using buttons in a spawn bay) and then picked up with the gravity gun and used. Blocks come in five different shapes (2x1x1 oblong, 5x1 panel, 3x2 panel, 2x2 panel, and 2x1 panel) which enable the players to create a wide variety of structures, which include crawl tunnels, sky forts, sprint ramps and walls.|$|E
25|$|In early August, Chicago {{businessman}} Arnold Johnson {{stepped forward}} with a complicated $3.375 million plan to buy the Athletics <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>them</b> to Kansas City. He owned Blues Stadium, home to the New York Yankees' top minor-league affiliate, but intended {{to sell it to}} the city for upgrading to major league standards. Roy, Earle and Connie Mack, Sr. would get about $1.5 million, plus Johnson would pay off the remaining mortgage and assume the $400,000–$800,000 debt to the concessionaires. Very little of Johnson's own cash would be involved: the deal depended on real estate and the eagerness of the Kansas City town fathers to take on debt to snag a major league franchise.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, the Victorian Parliamentary Inquiry into {{abuse of}} {{children}} was told by Archbishop Hart that Little had covered up paedophile priests <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>them</b> to other parishes where they would abuse again.|$|R
50|$|Skalbania {{himself would}} {{ultimately}} become an NHL owner {{a year after}} the merger when he fronted a Calgary-based ownership group that purchased the Atlanta Flames <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>them</b> north, where became the Calgary Flames.|$|R
50|$|In 2013 and 2014, Panaya {{laid off}} more than 25% of the company. In 2016, Panaya shut down their Israeli-based sales {{development}} <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>them</b> to Boston <b>and</b> the United Kingdom and replaced their CEO.|$|R
25|$|People with BPD {{are also}} {{especially}} sensitive {{to feelings of}} rejection, criticism, isolation, and perceived failure. Before learning other coping mechanisms, their efforts to manage or escape from their very negative emotions may lead to emotional isolation, self-injury or suicidal behavior. They are often aware of the intensity of their negative emotional reactions and, since they cannot regulate them, they shut them down entirely. This can be harmful to people with BPD, since negative emotions alert people {{to the presence of}} a problematic situation <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>them</b> to address it which the person with BPD would normally be aware of only to cause further distress. People with BPD may feel emotional relief after cutting themselves.|$|E
25|$|When Custer {{reached the}} {{junction}} of Adams Road and Brooks Road with Pennington's and Capehart's brigades, he found Ayres's division of Warren's corps had arrived at that location about dawn. Due to the wet ground, Merritt decided to deploy Custer's men dismounted <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>them</b> cross country to turn the Confederate right flank. Custer moved his men forward with Pennington's brigade {{on the left and}} Capehart's on the right, with Chamberlain's Bed and Bear Swamp to the cavalrymen's left. Custer's troopers captured a few Confederate stragglers and drove off a patrol guarding the Scott Road crossing of Bear Swamp. When Custer's men approached within several hundred yards of the Confederate defensive line at White Oak Road, he decided not to attack the apparently strong defenses but to send out combat patrols to test the line. They could not find a weak spot in the line so Custer told his men to hold their ground.|$|E
25|$|In {{the higher}} groups with two {{functional}} pairs of wings, both pairs are linked together mechanically in various ways, and {{function as a}} single wing, although {{this is not true}} in the more primitive groups. There are also exceptions to be found among the more advanced Neoptera; the ghost moth is able to unlock its pair of wings <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>them</b> independently, allowing them to hover like dragonflies. What all Neoptera share, however, is the way the muscles in the thorax work: these muscles, rather than attaching to the wings, attach to the thorax and deform it; since the wings are extensions of the thoracic exoskeleton, the deformations of the thorax cause the wings to move as well. A set of dorsal longitudinal muscles compress the thorax from front to back, causing the dorsal surface of the thorax (notum) to bow upward, making the wings flip down. A set of tergosternal muscles pull the notum downward again, causing the wings to flip upward.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, Gilbert {{purchased}} the NBADL's New Mexico Thunderbirds, <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>them</b> to Canton, Ohio (about an hour drive south of Cleveland) renaming them the Canton Charge, {{and making them}} the Cavaliers' new D-League affiliate.|$|R

25|$|On January 2, 2015, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution {{reported}} that Atlanta Spirit, then-owners of the Atlanta Hawks, {{would put the}} team up for sale. Initially, only majority owner Bruce Levenson would put his stake in the team up for sale; however, the remaining minority owners announced that they would sell their stakes as well. On January 6, 2015, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer {{reported that}} Chris Hansen and film producer Thomas Tull (the latter a minority owner of the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers) would put in separate bids to acquire the Hawks <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>them</b> to Seattle. However, the NBA stated that the Hawks were to remain in Atlanta {{as a condition of}} their sale; additionally, any attempt to move the Hawks would have incurred a $75 million penalty from the city of Atlanta and Fulton County for breaking the Hawks' lease at Philips Arena before 2017. The Hawks were sold to a group led by Tony Ressler on June 24, 2015.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s, the National Football League {{had grown}} to rival Major League Baseball {{as one of the}} most popular {{professional}} sports leagues in the United States. One franchise that did not share in this newfound success of the league was the Chicago Cardinals, owned by the Bidwill family, who had become overshadowed by the more popular Chicago Bears. The Bidwills hoped to relocate their franchise, preferably to St. Louis but could not come to terms with the league on a relocation fee. Needing cash, the Bidwills began entertaining offers from would-be investors, and one of the men who approached the Bidwills was Lamar Hunt, son and heir of millionaire oilman H. L. Hunt. Hunt offered to buy the Cardinals <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>them</b> to Dallas, where he had grown up. However, these negotiations came to nothing, since the Bidwills insisted on retaining a controlling interest in the franchise and were unwilling to move their team to a city where a previous NFL franchise had failed in 1952. While Hunt negotiated with the Bidwills, similar offers were made by Bud Adams, Bob Howsam, and Max Winter.|$|E
25|$|Released on September 12, 2002 in Japan and September 24 in North America, The Document of Metal Gear Solid 2 is an {{interactive}} database for the PS2 that documents {{the development of}} Metal Gear Solid 2. It contains a gallery of all the 3D models of characters, scenery and objects {{that were used in}} the game (as well as unused assets), along with corresponding concept art when available. All the real-time cutscenes (or polygon demos) are also available to view (without audio), with the option to pause them at any point, change the camera angle <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>them</b> frame by frame. Other content include storyboards, behind-the-scenes footage, preview trailers, music tracks (with the option to play alternate patterns when applicable), the finalized screenplay, Hideo Kojima's original draft (available in Japanese only), a development timeline, and a gallery of Metal Gear Solid related products and merchandise. The disc also includes a sampler selection of VR training missions that were later featured in Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance. In Europe, the disc was bundled as a bonus with the PS2 version of Substance instead of having a stand-alone release. It was also included in the Japanese 20th Anniversary re-release of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty on July 2007.|$|E
50|$|Around 1994, Mojena {{decided to}} cancel the show, and Sunshine Logroño took all the actors on the show <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>them</b> to Televicentro, {{creating}} El Condominio ("The Condominium"). This move would later on prove to be very controversial.|$|R
