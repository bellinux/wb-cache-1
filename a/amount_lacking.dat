Children performed a paired comparison task with positive and negative numbers during an fMRI session. As previously shown in adults, both pre-instruction fifth graders and post-instruction seventh graders demonstrated typical behavioral and neural distance effects to negative numbers, where response times and parietal and frontal activity increased as comparison distance decreased. We then determined the factors impacting the distance effect in each age group. Behaviorally, the fifth grader distance effect for negatives was significantly predicted only by positive comparison accuracy, indicating that children who were generally better at working with numbers were better at comparing negatives. In seventh graders, negative comparison accuracy significantly predicted their distance effect, indicating that children who were better at working with negative numbers demonstrated a more typical distance effect. Across children, as age increased, the negative number distance effect increased in the bilateral IPS and decreased frontally, indicating a frontoparietal shift consistent with previous numerical development literature. In contrast, as task accuracy increased, the parietal distance effect increased in the left IPS and decreased in the right, possibly indicating a change from an approximate understanding of negatives’ values to a more exact, precise representation (particularly supported by the left IPS) with increasing expertise. These shifts separately indicate the effects of increasing maturity generally in numeric processing and specifically in negative number understanding...|$|R

The increase in crop productivity as a result of various factors like increased human labour-use, rise in manure application and increased moisture availability have been translated into higher farm income in nominal as well as real terms.

This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the values of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and Simplified Acute Physiologic Score (SAPS II) models in prediction of 1 -month mortality of critically ill patients. Methods: The present prospective cross sectional study was performed on critically ill patients presented to emergency department during 6 months. Data required for calculation of the scores were gathered and performance of the models in prediction of 1 -month mortality were assessed using STATA software 11. 0. Results: 82 critically ill patients with the mean age of 53. 45 ± 20. 37 years were included (65. 9 % male). Their mortality rate was 48 %. Mean SAPS II (p < 0. 0001) and APACHE II (p = 0. 0007) scores were significantly higher in dead patients. Area under the ROC curve of SAPS II and APACHE II for prediction of mortality were 0. 75 (95 % CI: 0. 64 - 0. 86) and 0. 72 (95 % CI: 0. 60 - 0. 83), respectively (p = 0. 24).

40|$|Plasma {{electrolytic}} oxidation coatings were produced on AM 50 Mg alloy in alkaline phosphate based electrolyte with montmorillonite clay additives employing current densities of 30, 60, and 120 mA/cm(2). The effect of current density on the microstructure and corrosion {{properties of the}} coating was investigated. The clay additives got melted and reactively incorporated into the coating forming an amorphous phase, at all the current densities. However, the coating was predominantly amorphous only at 30 mA/cm(2) and with increasing current density, increasing fractions of crystalline phases were formed. Higher current densities resulted in increased thickness of the coating, but reduced the compactness of the coatings. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests in 0. 5 wt. % (0. 08 M) and 3. 5 wt. % (0. 6 M) NaCl solution revealed that the coatings processed at 30 mA/cm(2) exhibited a relatively better initial corrosion resistance owing to its relatively defect-free barrier layer and compactness of the coating. However, the presence of amorphous phases in significant <b>amounts</b> and <b>lack</b> of MgO in the coating resulted in increased rate of dissolution of the coatings and degradation of corrosion resistance. Coatings produced at higher current densities exhibited initial inferior corrosion resistance due to a more defective barrier layer and increased porosity in pore band and outer porous layer. However, the increased amount of crystalline phases and an increased amount of MgO, which resisted dissolution, counterbalanced the negative effects of defective barrier and increased porosity resulting in a relatively lower rate of the degradation of the corrosion resistance. Thus, the corrosion resistance of all the coatings continuously decreased with time and became similar after prolonged immersion in NaCl solution. Increasing current density, therefore, did not prove to be beneficial for the improvement of the corrosion performance of the PEO coatings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
