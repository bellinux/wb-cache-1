5|$|Over {{the course}} of his life, Rakoto Frah was commemorated by fellow artists and by the {{government}} of Madagascar, which issued him numerous awards and commendations throughout his career. The design for the 1,000Malagasy franc (200ariary) banknote first printed by the Central Bank in 1983 depicted Rakoto Frah dressed in a traditional straw hat and lamba and playing the sodina. He is the only artist to have been featured on a Malagasy banknote. According to a representative of the Central Bank, the artist was selected because he was the most representative of the Malagasy identity. After the Rakoto Frah banknote design was discontinued in the 1990s it became a rare collector's item valued in 2011 at over 100,000ariary, more than 500 times its face value. The artist was also invited by international filmmakers to feature in two French films: the Madagascar documentary L'Ile Rouge released in 1992 by French director Jean-Michel Carré, and an eponymous documentary <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> himself, produced by director Camille Marchand in 1997.|$|E

25|$|Lowry {{claimed to}} have only ever used five colours: Flake White (Lead White), Ivory Black, Vermillion Red, Prussian Blue and Yellow Ochre, all from the art-supply firm Winsor & Newton, but expert {{analysis}} of the paint used in Darby and Joan showed that it contained traces of Zinc White. However, the programme revealed a photograph of Lowry's studio in the 1950s which showed that he did have both Titanium White and Zinc White. The same painting was also plainly visible in a contemporary BBC documentary film <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist,</b> which included shots of his studio. All three works were judged to be genuine {{by a panel of}} experts, and the total value of the paintings was estimated to be in excess of £200,000.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, O'Brien {{started writing}} a book on Madonna, where she wanted to look at her life and work, as the artist was {{approaching}} the age of fifty. She believed that the general public was eager to know the real-self of Madonna, and she concentrated on finding that out. According to her, [...] "the popular negative stereotype <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> is that of a publicity-hungry, manipulative ball-breaker, while for many woman she is a beacon of feminism. I have always found her work clear and autobiographical, but her personality complex and disarmingly changeable." ...|$|E

But {{none of the}} art Homer sees serves to inspire him; he feels inadequate when he sees what other artists have done, and it only worsens the situation when he takes a nap and has a nightmare of various paintings attacking him. He goes back home, discouraged, but is soon given another suggestion by Lisa. She tells him <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> Christo, causing Homer to try doing something similarly groundbreaking. He and Bart flood Springfield by opening all the fire hydrants (having covered the sewer drains with the city's doormats, including their own) and putting snorkels in the animals of the zoo (so {{that they do not}} drown). Surprisingly, Astrid Weller and even the whole town of Springfield is impressed with Homer's work, and enjoy the newly made [...] "Grand Canals of Springfield" [...] along with the swimming zoo animals.

2500|$|Art critic Brian Sherwin {{lashed out}} at O’Shea’s {{criticism}} of Mark Vallen by saying that O’Shea’s SUPERTOUCH article {{was nothing more than}} [...] "damage control". Sherwin questioned O’Shea’s defense of Fairey, noting that Fairey is a SUPERTOUCH author and business associate of O’Shea. Sherwin suggests that O’Shea has a [...] "vested" [...] interest in making sure that Fairey is viewed positively by the public since he has curated art exhibits involving Fairey and has written extensively <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist.</b> Sherwin wrote that O’Shea once served as editor in chief for Juxtapoz and has worked as a creative director hired by corporate art collections as a corporate liaison for acquisitions. Sherwin concluded that the public will [...] "question the artist who says to question everything," [...] regardless of O’Shea’s Mark Vallen [...] "damage control" [...] on SUPERTOUCH. Sherwin implied that O'Shea's critique of Vallen was selective because key negative facts about Fairey's history were left out in the article.

6000|$|Mr. Bellamy {{has many}} ingenious {{arrangements}} {{to meet the}} needs of people who want to be singers or actors or writers,--in other words, who do not want to work. They may sing or act as much as they like, provided that enough other people will hand over enough of their food cards to keep them going. But if no one wants to hear them sing or see them act they may starve,--just as they do now. Here the author harks back unconsciously to his nineteenth century individualism; he need not have done so; other socialist writers would have it that one of the everlasting boards would [...] "sit on" [...] every aspiring actor or author before he was allowed to begin. But we may take it either way. It is not the major point. There is no need to discuss the question of how to deal with the artist under socialism. If the rest of it were all right, no one need worry <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist.</b> Perhaps he would do better without being remunerated at all. It is doubtful whether the huge commercial premium that greets success to-day does good or harm. But let it pass. It is immaterial to the present matter.|$|E
6000|$|But I ought n't {{to talk of}} mouldy alleys, or yet of azure distances, as if {{they formed}} the main appeal to taste in this {{accomplished}} little city. In the Sala del Cambio, where in ancient days the money-changers rattled their embossed coin and figured up their profits, you may enjoy one of the serenest aesthetic pleasures that {{the golden age of}} art anywhere offers us. Bank parlours, I believe, are always handsomely appointed, but are even those of Messrs. Rothschild such models of mural bravery as this little counting-house of a bygone fashion? The bravery is Perugino's own; for, invited clearly to do his best, he left it as a lesson to the ages, covering the four low walls and the vault with scriptural and mythological figures of extraordinary beauty. They are ranged in artless attitudes round the upper half of the room--the sibyls, the prophets, the philosophers, the Greek and Roman heroes--looking down with broad serene faces, with small mild eyes and sweet mouths that commit them to nothing in particular unless to being comfortably and charmingly alive, at the incongruous proceedings of a Board of Brokers. Had finance a very high tone in those days, or were genius and faith then simply as frequent as capital and enterprise are among ourselves? The great distinction of the Sala del Cambio is that it has a friendly Yes for both these questions. There was a rigid transactional probity, it seems to say; there was also a high tide of inspiration. <b>About</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> himself many things come up for us--more than I can attempt in their order; for he was not, I think, to an attentive observer, the mere smooth and entire and devout spirit we at first are inclined to take him for. He has that about him which leads us to wonder if he may not, after all, play a proper part enough here as the patron of the money-changers. He is the delight of a million of young ladies; but who knows whether we should n't find in his works, might we [...] "go into" [...] them a little, a trifle more of manner than of conviction, and of system than of deep sincerity? ...|$|E
