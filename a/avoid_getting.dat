5|$|My {{interpretation}} {{is that she}} isn’t {{trying to keep the}} secret. That she doesn’t care. She changed her last name to <b>avoid</b> <b>getting</b> kidnapped, but really, if anyone figured it out and asked her, she’d just probably be like “Yeah, shut up!” or whatever. I feel like everyone at ISIS is so self-involved and so concerned with furthering their own agenda that it would never occur to them to think that anyone else has anything else going on.|$|E

His parents {{separated}} when he was 14 years old and consequently {{he lived with his}} father at his grandmother's house on a different estate.

His father, also named Joseph, worked as a roofer and played football semi-professionally for Northwich Victoria. Barton enjoyed physical education at his school, St Thomas Becket, which he represented in various sports and was a talented rugby league prospect. He left school with ten GCSEs.|$|E

Between him being suspected, more New Gen murders occurring, and Shogun supposedly targeting him, Takumi finds himself experiencing hallucinations and paranoia, and is unsure of what is real and who he can trust.

When local police officer Hal Jackson visits the Dixons and learns that Alan's license has arrived, he sits down and tells Alan ways to drive safely and <b>avoid</b> <b>getting</b> into accidents.

During production, assistance was provided by staff of the National Safety Council, along with the Idaho State Police and the Colorado State Patrol.|$|E
5|$|Abdulwahab Hussain {{was also}} a member of Al Wefaq who {{resigned}} in 2005. Unlike Mushaima and al-Singace, Hussain left politics in 2005. He returned in 2009 when he co-founded Al Wafa' opposition group and became its official spokesperson. He played a bigger role in the uprising; he was not arrested when the uprising began nor was he outside the country. Hussain led the first demonstration in the uprising {{in the early hours of}} 14 February. He is also credited with suggesting autonomous action and total decentralization of the protest movement which was adopted by February 14 Youth Coalition, the group behind the call for an uprising in order to <b>avoid</b> <b>getting</b> infiltrated by government.|$|E
5|$|In San Francisco, {{particularly}} in the Castro District, gay community activists such as Bill Kraus and Cleve Jones found a new direction in gay rights when so many men came down with strange illnesses in 1980. The San Francisco Department of Public Health began tracing the disease, linked it to certain sexual practices, and made recommendations—stop having sex—to gay men to <b>avoid</b> <b>getting</b> sick, a directive that defied the chief reason why many gay men had migrated to the Castro, and for what gay rights activists in San Francisco had fought for years. Kraus and Jones often found themselves fighting a two-fronted battle: against city politicians who would rather not deal with a disease that affected gay men, who were seen as an undesirable population, and the gay men themselves, who refused to listen to doomsday projections and continued their unsafe behavior.|$|E

He is a retired gentleman who drives an obsolete Renault 4CV and lives {{in the suburbs of}} Paris, France. He maintains a wide range of contacts in government and scientific circles as well as with many experts in fields outside the mainstream such as ufology, telepathy, and sorcery.

Unlike Valérian he tries to <b>avoid</b> <b>getting</b> involved {{in the thick of the}} action and never acts impulsively, always preferring to take his time about things. He enjoys the finer things in life: gourmet cuisine, fine wines and likes to take things easy.|$|E
5|$|Rabban Bar Sauma, a Nestorian Christian Uyghur Turk born in Zhongdu (later Khanbaliq, Beijing, {{capital of}} the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty), China, was sent to Europe in 1287 as an {{ambassador}} for Arghun, ruler of the Ilkhanate and grandnephew of Kublai Khan. He was preceded by Isa Kelemechi, an Assyrian Nestorian Christian {{who worked as a}} court astronomer for Kublai Khan in Khanbaliq, and was sent by Arghun to Pope Honorius IV in 1285. A decade earlier, Bar Sauma had originally set out on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, passing through Gansu and Khotan in Northwest China, yet spent time in Armenia and Baghdad instead to <b>avoid</b> <b>getting</b> caught up in nearby armed conflicts. He had been accompanied by Rabban Markos, another Uyghur Nestorian Christian from China who was elected as the Patriarch of the Eastern Church and advised Arghun Khan to have Bar Sauma lead the diplomatic mission to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Dot holds a {{birthday}} party for Dotty, inviting Tiffany (Maisie Smith) and Liam Butcher (James Forde), {{but they do not}} want to attend. The next day, Tiffany tells Dotty she is not invited to her birthday party. Dotty tells Dot that Tiffany is not having a party and asks if they can invite her round.

Dotty takes Tiffany's bridesmaid's dress and MP3 player, after Tiffany does not allow her to try the dress on, and runs away with them, throwing the MP3 player into a bin. Dotty pushes Tiffany into the bin as she tries to retrieve it. Dotty then runs away to <b>avoid</b> <b>getting</b> in trouble, and when Tiffany is found, Bianca visits Dot, who is unsure about Bianca's claims. Dotty tells Dot she knows nothing about the dress but Dot then finds it in Dotty's school bag. Dot returns the dress to Bianca without Dotty's knowledge. The next day, Dotty is left alone with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) who is recovering from a stroke. She pours water on him to make it seem he has wet himself, but Dot catches her.

25|$|The {{disclosure}} of adverse events {{is important in}} maintaining trust {{in the relationship between}} healthcare provider and patient. It is also important in learning how to avoid these mistakes in the future by conducting quality improvement reviews, or clinical peer review.

50|$|Jeffrey Joseph as Willie Dawson, a {{football}} star {{at the same}} high school Scott attends, and the only other male usher at the Majestic.

Often he shows up late to work because of football practice, but invariably <b>avoids</b> <b>getting</b> caught by Mr. Brown.|$|R
25|$|Death feigning {{may also}} play a role in reproduction, For example, in the nursery web spider, the male {{sometimes}} feigns death to <b>avoid</b> <b>getting</b> eaten by females during mating. In some cases, death feigning is used by a predator. For example, the predatory cichlid Haplochromis livingstoni lies on its side on the bottom sediments until approached by scavengers attracted to {{what appears to be a}} dead fish, whereupon H. livingstoni abandons the pretence, rights itself and attacks the scavenger.|$|E
25|$|An injured Pritilata {{was trapped}} by the British police. She {{swallowed}} cyanide to <b>avoid</b> <b>getting</b> arrested. The next day, the police found her body and identified her.

25|$|Water {{sensitive}} {{objects are}} masked {{in plastic wrap}} to <b>avoid</b> <b>getting</b> wet. A slurry of precipitated (pharmaceutical grade) calcium carbonate and deionized water is created and rubbed onto the silver piece with a cotton rag or cotton ball. It is recommended that the slurry be tested on the bottom or in a non-visible area of the silver for abrasiveness. If the slurry is too abrasive it will scratch the surface and increase the potential for future tarnishing. The polish is applied with a soft cloth and polished in a circular motion.|$|E
25|$|The virus circulates between ticks and rodents, {{with humans}} being the {{secondary}} hosts. People {{at risk for}} catching the disease are hikers and campers {{that are in the}} risk areas. Also, April, May, and June are when the infections mainly occur, because this is the time when the adult ticks are prevalent in the environment. Unfortunately, this is also when the weather is pleasant for hiking and camping. The best way to <b>avoid</b> <b>getting</b> bitten and catching this disease is wearing long sleeves or pants, avoiding high tick-infested areas, and wearing tick repellent.|$|E
25|$|Israelites were {{forbidden}} to charge interest on loans made to other Israelites, but allowed to charge interest on transactions with non-Israelites, as the latter were often amongst the Israelites {{for the purpose of}} business anyway; but in general, it was seen as advantageous to <b>avoid</b> <b>getting</b> into debt at all, to avoid being bound to someone else. Debt was to be avoided and not used to finance consumption, but only taken on when in need; however, the laws against usury were among many laws which the prophets condemn the people for breaking.|$|E
5000|$|The {{indifferent}} (previously called impoverished) style (1,1): evade and elude. In this style, {{managers have}} low concern for both people and production.

The main {{concern for the}} manager {{is not to be}} held responsible for any mistakes, which results in less innovation decisions.|$|R
