40|$|Traceback schemes aim at {{identifying}} the source(s) of {{a sequence of}} packets and the nodes these packets traversed. This is useful for tracing the sources of high volume traffic, e. g., in Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. In this paper, {{we are interested in}} Probabilistic Packet Marking (PPM) schemes, in which intermediate nodes probabilistically mark packets with information about their identity and the receiver uses information from several packets to reconstruct the paths traversed by these packets. The main idea of the paper is a network coding-based approach that marks packets with random linear combinations of the router ids instead of individual router ids. We show that this approach decreases significantly the number of packets required to reconstruct the attack paths. We also show that it is implementable in practice using a small number of under-utilized bits on the IP packet header; our proposed practical scheme optimizes the tradeoff in the bit-budget allocation, naturally raised by the network coding marking approach, and reconstructs the attack graph with low computational complexity, high accuracy and low delay. We also combine the network coding <b>marking</b> approach with <b>adjusting</b> the <b>marking</b> probabilities of different routers and show that this further improves the performance. Along the way, we accurately model the performance of our proposed as well as of prior PPM schemes based on the coupon collector’s problem with unequal probabilities. We show the significant benefit of our proposed schemes through comparison to several baseline schemes, under the same bit-budget, and considering various attack topologies. The ideas of network coding-based <b>marking</b> and <b>adjusted</b> <b>marking</b> probabilities are orthogonal to and can be combined with several existing PPM schemes to improve the overall performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background A {{potential}} problem of clinical examinations {{is known as}} the hawk-dove problem, some examiners being more stringent and requiring a higher performance than other examiners who are more lenient. Although the problem has been known qualitatively for at least a century, we know of no previous statistical estimation {{of the size of the}} effect in a large-scale, high-stakes examination. Here we use FACETS to carry out a multi-facet Rasch modelling of the paired judgements made by examiners in the clinical examination (PACES) of MRCP(UK), where identical candidates were assessed in identical situations, allowing calculation of examiner stringency. Methods Data were analysed from the first nine diets of PACES, which were taken between June 2001 and March 2004 by 10, 145 candidates. Each candidate was assessed by two examiners on each of seven separate tasks. with the candidates assessed by a total of 1, 259 examiners, resulting in a total of 142, 030 marks. Examiner demographics were described in terms of age, sex, ethnicity, and total number of candidates examined. Results FACETS suggested that about 87 % of main effect variance was due to candidate differences, 1 % due to station differences, and 12 % due to differences between examiners in leniency-stringency. Multiple regression suggested that greater examiner stringency was associated with greater examiner experience and being from an ethnic minority. Male and female examiners showed no overall difference in stringency. Examination scores were adjusted for examiner stringency and it was shown that for the present pass mark, the outcome for 95. 9 % of candidates would be unchanged using adjusted marks, whereas 2. 6 % of candidates would have passed, even though they had failed on the basis of raw marks, and 1. 5 % of candidates would have failed, despite passing on the basis of raw marks. Conclusion Examiners do differ in their leniency or stringency, and the effect can be estimated using Rasch modelling. The reasons for differences are not clear, but there are some demographic correlates, and the effects appear to be reliable across time. Account can be taken of differences, either by <b>adjusting</b> <b>marks</b> or, perhaps more effectively and more justifiably, by pairing high and low stringency examiners, so that raw marks can be used in the determination of pass and fail. </p...|$|E

40|$|IP traceback {{is one of}} {{the defense}} {{mechanisms}} for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. However, most traceback schemes consume extensive resources such as CPU, memory, disk storage and bandwidth and require a large amount of IP packets to reconstruct sources, which makes them impractical and ineffective. In this paper, we present a new flexible IP traceback scheme called Flexible Deterministic Packet Marking (FDPM). The flexibilities of FDPM are in two ways, one is that it can adjust the length of marking field according to the network protocols deployed, thus it can work well even in an environment with different network protocols; the other is that it can <b>adjust</b> the <b>marking</b> rate according to the load of participating router, while it still can maintain the marking function. In order to verify the effectiveness of FDPM for DDoS defense in terms of marking efficiency, maximum forwarding rate, and number of packets for reconstruction, we tested FDPM by both simulation and Linux router implementation with an emphasis on the latter. The experiments demonstrate that the built-in overload prevention mechanism, flow-based marking, can isolate and mark the most possible DDoS attack packets, while keeping the load of the participating router in a reasonably low degree. The real hardware implementation confirms that this flexible capability is important when traceback mechanisms are used in a real DDoS defense scenario...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new approach, called Flexible Deterministic Packet Marking (FDPM), to perform a {{large-scale}} IP traceback to defend against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. In a DDoS attack the victim host or network is usually attacked by {{a large number of}} spoofed IP packets coming from multiple sources. IP traceback is the ability to trace the IP packets to their sources without relying on the source address field of the IP header. FDPM provides many flexible features to trace the IP packets and can obtain better tracing capability than current IP traceback mechanisms, such as Probabilistic Packet Marking (PPM), and Deterministic Packet Marking (DPM). The flexibilities of FDPM are in two ways, one is that it can adjust the length of marking field according to the network protocols deployed; the other is that it can <b>adjust</b> the <b>marking</b> rate according to the load of participating routers. The implementation and evaluation demonstrates that the FDPM needs moderately {{only a small number of}} packets to complete the traceback process; and can successfully perform a large-scale IP traceback, for example, trace up to 110, 000 sources in a single incident response.

Today’s typical bowler comes from a broader swath of the middle-class, and is unlikely to bowl in a league. Non-league bowlers bowl less often. And when they do bowl, they expect nicer amenities - automatic scoring, a variety of food and beverage options, and more attractive facilities.” As evidence of the shift, the company noted that, “according to the United States Bowling Congress, in 1998 the nation’s three largest league bowling organizations had over 4.1 million members. Just a decade later, membership had declined by 36% to 2.6 million.” To respond to the change in the average bowling customer, AMF constructed nine upscale 300 Centers with “high-end bars and lounges designed with a modern décor” that drew “significant business through group events.” However, the Great Recession of 2008 eroded AMF's ability to maintain and enhance its 262 existing US bowling centers and meant that people were bowling less often.

We carried out a series of box flume experiments (65 cm long, 30 cm wide), to explore the importance of mean discharge and substrate strength on the form and migration of knickpoints in a cohesive homogenous substrate. The retreat rate of knickpoints is independent of mean discharge, with knickpoints retreating faster through a weaker substrate. Despite an order of magnitude increase in discharge during our experiments, the bed shear stress remains almost constant due to a self-regulatory response of channel width to higher discharge, leading to no change in the upstream retreat rate of the waterfalls. These experiments challenge the established assumption in models of landscape evolution that a simple relationship exists between knickpoint retreat and discharge/drainage area, and we hypothesise that the correlation between knickpoint retreat and drainage area identified in some landscapes is caused by increasing bedload flux (the ‘tools’ for erosion) with drainage area. Knickpoint retreat modelling approaches should therefore be re-evaluated, and greater attention paid to the role of bedload flux and connectivity between river channels and hillslopes...|$|R

Unadjusted analysis showed students who took an iBSc before their third year achieved significantly higher end of year marks than those who did not with a mean score difference of 4. 4 (0. 9 to 7. 9 95 % CI, p = 0. 01). (overall mean score 238. 4 "completed iBSc" students versus 234. 0 "not completed", range 145. 2 - 272. 3 out of 300). There was however a significant difference between the two groups in their prior second year exam marks with those choosing to intercalate before their third year having higher <b>marks.</b> <b>Adjusting</b> for this, the difference in overall exam scores was no longer significant with a mean score difference of 1. 4 (- 4. 9 to + 7. 7 95 % CI, p = 0. 66). (overall mean score 238. 0 " completed iBSc" students versus 236. 5 "not completed"). Conclusions Once possible confounders are controlled for (age, sex, previous academic performance) undertaking an iBSc does not influence third year exam results. One explanation for this confounding in unadjusted results is that students who do better in their second year exams are more likely to take an iBSc before their third year. </p...|$|R
