5|$|Next in the line, to the north, was Quinn's Post, {{defended by}} the 15th Battalion and the 2nd Light Horse Regiment.

This lasted for about an hour when the Turks went over the top and assaulted the post. As elsewhere, they were stopped by the weight of the Australian fire, not only from the trench they were attacking, but also by the defenders at Pope's and from the 2nd New Zealand Artillery Battery. Three more Turkish attacks were also repulsed in a similar fashion.|$|E

5|$|On 15 July 2010, despite Octopus' {{claims to}} have never sold data, a former {{employee}} of the CIGNA insurance company claimed CIGNA purchased records for 2.4 million Octopus users. On 20 July, Octopus acknowledged selling customers' personal details to Cigna and CPP, and started an internal review of their data practices.

Outgoing Privacy Commissioner Woo pledged to finish a preliminary report on the Octopus privacy abuse before his term ends, and called for a new law making it a criminal offence for companies to sell personal data.|$|E
