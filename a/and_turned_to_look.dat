2500|$|In 1996 Valdobrev {{married his}} high school love Jana. [...] "We have many shared {{memories}} as childhood sweethearts in Stara Zagora. We were 10 when we first met. Our parents were coming back from an excursion, we {{got off the bus}} at the same station and headed in different directions. After a few meters I stopped <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back. She had stopped too and was looking at me. We stood like that for a few moments, staring at each other, our parents holding our hands. Growing up with someone's memories and making that journey through adulthood together is probably what makes a relationship strong. No one knows me better than Jana." [...] In 1998 Jana gave birth to their daughter Maria. Three weeks after that Valdobrev had a terrible car accident that almost cost him his life and kept him immovable and out of action for a year. For that reason he couldn’t join Regis Wargnier’s Oscar-nominated film production East/West, for which he'd been cast to play opposite Catherine Deneuve and Sandrine Bonnaire.|$|E
2500|$|At Woodstock in 1969, Hoffman {{reportedly}} interrupted The Who's {{performance to}} attempt to speak against the jailing of John Sinclair of the White Panther Party. He grabbed a microphone and yelled, [...] "I {{think this is a}} pile of shit while John Sinclair rots in prison..." [...] Pete Townshend was adjusting his amplifier between songs <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Hoffman over his left shoulder. Townshend shouted [...] "Fuck off! Fuck off my fucking stage!" [...] and reportedly ran at Hoffman with his guitar and hit Hoffman in the back, although Townshend later denied attacking Hoffman. Townshend later said that while he actually agreed with Hoffman on Sinclair's imprisonment, he would have knocked him offstage regardless of the content of his message, given that Hoffman had violated the [...] "sanctity of the stage," [...] i.e., the right of the band to perform uninterrupted by distractions not relevant to the show. The incident took place during a camera change, and was not captured on film. The audio of this incident, however, can be heard on The Who's box set, Thirty Years of Maximum R (Disc 2, Track 20, [...] "Abbie Hoffman Incident").|$|E
60|$|In sheer amazement M. Binet {{checked in}} his stride, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at his companion.|$|E
50|$|In the Batcave, Carrie disembarks {{from the}} Batmobile and {{approaches}} the Batcomputer terminal. Bruce Wayne stands {{there with a}} crutch <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at her with an unreadable expression.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Rembrandt's 1660 {{depiction}} of Peter's Denial. Jesus, {{in the upper}} right hand corner, is at the high priest's house, his hands bound behind him, <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Peter.|$|R
60|$|Then, slowly {{dragging}} his feet, stumbling, half-blinded, <b>turning</b> <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back, the boy groped {{his way out}} through the trees toward that sound; and, as he went, that dark spirit-elf, abandoned, clasping her own lithe body with her arms, never moved her gaze from him.|$|R
60|$|He put {{his coat}} on again, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for some drift-wood {{with which to}} make a raft.|$|E
60|$|He {{gripped his}} knees <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at me again. For half a minute, perhaps, he stared silently.|$|E
60|$|James {{shrugged his}} shoulders, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Mary, who was coming towards him with letters in her hand.|$|E
5000|$|I {{watch him}} hit the ground, <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for more Boche, {{but there is}} not a plane in the sky; so I point my machine home and am greeted by hand shakes and cheers. [...] "Oh yes we saw the beggar go down in flames, so we came home." ...|$|R
6000|$|EILEEN (walks weakly up the road, but, as {{she passes}} the signpost, she {{suddenly}} stops <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> again at Murray, who has not moved or lifted his eyes. A great shuddering sob shatters her pent-up emotions. She runs back to Murray, her arms outstretched, with a choking cry). Stephen! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certitude of what, Sire?" [...] {{she asked}} {{suddenly}} pausing {{in the dance}} <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> him straight in the eyes. [...] "I humbly crave your Majesty's pardon, but meseems {{that we are at}} cross-purposes, and that your Majesty speaks of something which I, on the other hand, do not understand." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{straightened}} his tie {{in front of}} the looking-glass <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at her with something like wonder in his eyes.|$|E
60|$|The {{adjutant}} saluted and retired. The colonel ground {{his heel}} {{into the earth}} <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> again at the enemy's guns.|$|E
60|$|Sir Crispin's ballad {{broke off}} short, whilst the lad {{paused in the}} act of quitting the room, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> to him for direction.|$|E
60|$|The Major gave an {{involuntary}} start, <b>and</b> then <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him curiously.|$|R
60|$|A picador {{passes on}} horseback in his uncouth clothes, <b>and</b> all <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him.|$|R
50|$|The {{camera is}} usually {{stationary}} throughout the film, but {{this trend is}} sometimes contrasted by abrupt, rapid movements of the camera. The sudden movements are always accompanied by a loud sound effect, usually an explosive gunshot. A notable exception is the final crane shot, which moves gently away from the Butcher's window <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> down an empty street.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't know," [...] said Button-Bright, who {{was half}} scared. Polly whirled {{away to a}} {{distance}} <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the copper man in a fright.|$|E
60|$|He {{reined in}} <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at her; her horse moved on a pace or two, then {{came to a}} halt, {{apparently}} of its own accord.|$|E
60|$|The latch clicked upward, {{and out of}} {{the night}} our {{pedestrian}} appeared upon the door-mat. The shepherd arose, snuffed two of the nearest candles, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him.|$|E
60|$|The cashier glared {{fiercely}} at Sam for an instant, <b>and</b> then <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{steadily in}} another direction.|$|R
60|$|It was as well, however, {{that the}} rescue did {{not depend on}} his sole prowess. Indeed, {{by the time the}} brother and sister were {{clinging}} together <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> round, the first shock was over, and the retainers of Albany, probably fancying the attack made by a much larger troop, were either in full flight, or getting decidedly the worst in their encounters with their assailants.|$|R
30|$|Balaram ran {{his eyes}} coldly over him. Certainly not, he snapped, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> back <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Bhudeb Roy’s house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Kurt, indeed I do--very dearly," [...] she replied, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> up {{into his}} face. It was transfigured. Lenore's heart swelled as a deep and {{profound}} emotion waved over her.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{a strange}} {{delusion}} is this!" [...] I thought to myself, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at my companions, when I found all looking, {{one at the}} other, as if to ask a common explanation.|$|E
60|$|The others stopped <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{upon the}} {{encounter}} with no particular show of interest. It was as though one of the party had paused to readjust a sandal and the others merely waited until {{he was ready to}} march on again.|$|E
60|$|I {{walked to}} the door, waited a moment before I opened it, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> round <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at her again.|$|R
6000|$|He took it curiously, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> it <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the signature. [...] "Aha!" [...] he said, [...] "my golden idol {{has been}} making mischief, has she?" ...|$|R
50|$|The retrospective-prospective {{structure}} is a two-part structure {{that begins with}} a consideration of past events <b>and</b> then <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> ahead <b>to</b> the future or else look a present situation differently.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why didn't you fling it {{over the}} wall, as I did the cat?" [...] asked Mr. Dover, smiling, as he shut up the truant fowl, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the rosy, breathless child, whose pink frock bore the marks of many a tumble on grass and gravel.|$|E
60|$|For a time Dr. Martineau desisted. He went to {{the window}} <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> again at the impassive figure on the bed. Did Sir Richmond fully understand? He made a step towards his patient and hesitated. Then he brought a chair and sat down at the bedside.|$|E
60|$|But on the {{threshold}} she paused. Milor was sitting at a gigantic escritoire placed squarely {{in front of the}} window. He had obviously been writing; at the slight sound of the creaking door and the swish of Lydie's skirts, he raised his head from his work <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at her.|$|E
60|$|Jim hurried Nell {{toward the}} bushes where Wingenund's tall form could dimly be seen. Mr. Wells {{followed}} them. On {{the edge of}} the clearing Jim <b>and</b> Nell <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back.|$|R
60|$|With {{the first}} {{rays of the}} sun he set forth, and {{travelled}} through deserts and over mountains and across rivers, and all befell him which had befallen Kynon, till he stood under the leafless tree listening to the song of the birds. Then he heard the voice, <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> found the knight galloping to meet him. Fiercely they fought till their lances were broken, and then they drew their swords, and a blow from Owen cut through the knight's helmet, and pierced his skull.|$|R
