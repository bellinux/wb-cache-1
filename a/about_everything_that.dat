25|$|All the storylines collide when Brad's house catches fire. While {{the fire}} trucks {{get stuck in}} a traffic jam, Tommy comes on his bicycle {{to put out the}} fire, which {{incidentally}} trapped Dawn inside. As he saves her life, the two fall in love. Meanwhile, Brad despairs at the destruction of his house, the symbol of his material success. Albert attains a sort of enlightenment when he synthesizes the two opposing outlooks of the Jaffes and Vauban to realize the cosmic truth of everything. Brad, meanwhile, is fired from Huckabees, leaving him rudderless. Albert reveals to Brad that he burned Brad's jet skis, and the fire spread to the house. Albert understands that he and Brad are no different, that everything really is inextricably connected, but that these connections necessarily arise from the often senselessly painful reality of human existence. Having realized this, he refers Brad to Caterine, hoping she will help him as she did Albert and Tommy. Albert and Tommy talk later <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> has happened. As the two talk, Caterine and the Jaffes watch them, concluding that they can close both of their cases.|$|E

He looked like Rupert of Hentzau, and had all of that worthy's cold, sinister resolution <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> he did." ...|$|E

I heard his voice, that's what it sounded like – full of wonderment and confusion <b>about</b> <b>everything.</b> <b>That,</b> to me, was Hugh." [...] Following his appearance in the episode, he later pitched a couple of story ideas to the producers to feature the return of Hugh. He was happy when the character later returned in the [...] finale/ opener [...] "", which he felt was similar to his previous ideas.|$|E

In the ensuing media circus, {{a press conference}} is held, where they lie <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> has {{happened}} on the island, going as far as {{saying that they are}} the only living survivors of the plane crash. Sometime later, Hurley's dad (Cheech Marin) gives Hurley his newly rebuilt 1970s Camaro, at a surprise birthday party. Hurley, however, becomes panicked and runs away when he notices that the car's odometer displays the numbers.

500|$|Spider-Man 2 {{opened in}} US theaters on June 30, 2004. This entry focuses on Peter Parker's struggles, {{as he tries}} to manage both his {{personal}} life and his duties as Spider-Man. He also has to stop the film's main villain, Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina), a man who becomes insane after an experiment of his goes haywire. Spider-Man 2 [...] was less successful in its first week of release, taking first place at the box office with around $88 million at 4,152 locations. Nonetheless, the sequel set several box office records at the time and broke the record for best opening day title ever, previously held by the preceding Spider-Man film. It eventually made more than $783 million worldwide but still stands as the lowest-grossing in the trilogy. However, it also stands as the best received film in the franchise. Movie critics believed the second installment had better humor and action sequences than its predecessor and that it was [...] "unusually good" [...] for its genre. A writer for website IGN said this film had [...] "a better flowing storyline, more emotional depth, and a less ridiculous looking supervillain, Spider-Man 2 elevated the series to just <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> comic fans love about the character." [...] The website also ranked Spider-Man 2 as being the third best superhero film of all-time on their 2005 list. Time magazine also named the sequel the third best superhero movie on their top-ten list published in 2011.|$|E
5000|$|Robbie Russell from VRS Mag said; [...] "The EP {{in general}} is a genre defying romp through just <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that’s</b> been popular on the {{internet}} in the past 10 years. Melding house, hip-hop and trap; Zhu is {{able to create a}} body of work that not only doesn’t have a face, but doesn’t have a category to be dumped into either." [...] and concluded with [...] "it's... odd but it works".|$|R
5000|$|... "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] is a feel-good, radio-friendly {{song about}} good vibes and 'doing your thing'. [...] "I'm a lover, not a fighter.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Tonight, Rihanna explained the tour's title. She stated, [...] "I {{like to think about}} myself as 'The Last Girl on Earth' because sometimes people make decisions based on the outlook of others and, you know, to me, my life is my life. It's my world, and I'm going to live it the way I want to. That's how I think <b>about</b> <b>everything,</b> <b>that</b> way I'm focused on me, and my work.

2500|$|The {{religious}} {{faith of the}} Huichols is still based on a “trinity” of veneration of the deer, corn and peyote. The last is ritually gathered each year on a long pilgrimage to the desert area of San Luis Potosí, where the people {{are said to have}} originated and used by shamans. [...] The importance of this and the pantheon of gods is seen in their stylistic representations on just <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> the Huichol decorate. They did not have a written language until recently, so these symbols were and are the primary form of preserving the ceremonies, myths and beliefs of ancient Huichol religion.|$|E
2500|$|The scholastic-philosophical {{approach}} to morality stemming largely from Thomas Aquinas was {{used during the}} papacy of John Paul II to give most attention to the [...] "intrinsic evil" [...] of abortion. But the misuse of the term to determine the gravity of an evil, along with the narrow delimitation of intrinsic evils, has been noted by theologians. Francis has criticized those homilies [...] "which should be kerygmatic but end up speaking <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> has a connection with sex, ... {{whether or not to}} participate in a demonstration against a draft law in favor of the use of condoms". He adds: [...] "We end up forgetting the treasure of Jesus alive, the treasure of the Holy Spirit present in our hearts, the treasure of a project of Christian life that has many implications that go much further than mere sexual questions".|$|E

Andrea reveals to him that she's going to Brown in the fall and Todd is surprised at how smart she actually is. They attempt to have sex, but they can't because Todd is unable to get an erection.

2500|$|Truex {{was happy}} with his team's performance, [...] "I'm so proud of the team – all {{the guys on the}} team and {{everybody}} at MWR. Clint (Bowyer) and Brian (Vickers) were up front all day long. This just says a lot <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> everybody at MWR has done over the off season – working hard, giving us good race cars. We got off in the mid-part of the race, but had the race strategy at the end and a fast enough car to stay up there.” Earnhardt regretted colliding with team-mate Jeff Gordon, “I’m mad because I screwed myself on pit road speeding. I’m pretty upset about that. Otherwise, I feel bad about running into Jeff’s car. I had a good day other than that. I had a good time. … I feel bad about what happened with Jeff, but damn, we were just racing." ...|$|E
2500|$|During her {{reign as}} Miss America Williams was criticized in some venues for winning. She later stated that [...] "there {{were a lot}} of people that did not want me to be {{representative}} of the United States and Miss America. And not just white people alone. There {{were a lot of}} people who had issues [...] I was too light. My eyes were the wrong color. My hair wasn't the right texture and getting criticism for being who I was." [...] She was also the target of persistent racist hate mail and death threats (which she documented in her memoir, You Have No Idea). Thirty years later, when Miss America 2014 Nina Davuluri (who was also a former Miss New York and Miss Syracuse) became the target of a racist social media backlash, Williams recounted the similarities with her own experiences, stating that she [...] "wrote a book <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> I went through, and I spent a lot of time talking about the death threats, the FBI, the sharpshooters ... it was a graver situation and more dangerous years ago—the change that was happening and the uproar because of the color of my skin." ...|$|E
2500|$|The anime {{adaptation}} of the series has received critical acclaim by reviewers. Jacob Hope Chapman from Anime News Network praised the cast and studio Bones' work. Additionally, he liked the consistency in quality and commented [...] "The contiguous threads laced through these episodic adventures are beginning to converge fast, and while I can't see the full picture yet, I know Rie Matsumoto is building the anime-original material of Leo's romance into something special. The animation continues to be jaw-dropping. The music continues to be soul-warming. There's never enough time in one writeup to talk <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> makes the episode so damn good. Blood Blockade Battlefront continues to be The Very Best." [...] Jarius Taylor from the Fandom Post called it [...] "both ridiculously cool and ridiculously weird" [...] and praised the cast like Chapman. In a later review he said [...] "It’s still not entirely clear what this show is going for yet but for now it’s a good ride and I have more than enough faith in the people behind it to believe the destination will be worthwhile." [...] Rachael Verret, a writer from The Mary Sue, gave the series a perfect score having pointed out its [...] "energy and joviality" [...] seen through the cast and the ending sequences which reminded her of another series, Baccano!. Similarly, Chapman wrote an article titled [...] "Three Reasons Why Blood Blockade Battlefront is the Best Show of the Spring" [...] commenting [...] "It's the coolest, cutest, and cleverest anime I've {{seen in a long}} time, easily the best new show of the Spring 2015." ...|$|E
