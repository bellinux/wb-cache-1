5|$|If these {{conditions}} <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> multinational corporations will transfer via their offshore subsidiaries or to their offshore suppliers, the specific production technologies and market linkages necessary {{to participate in}} the global economy. By themselves, developing countries, even if well-educated, cannot produce at the quality levels demanded in high-value-added industries and cannot market what they produce even in low-value-added industries such as textiles or shoes. Put bluntly, multinational companies possess a variety of factors that developing countries must have if they are {{to participate in the}} global economy.|$|E
5|$|In practice, {{different}} {{data collection}} mechanisms {{are used by}} different transport operators, depending {{on the nature of}} their business. The MTR equips its stations with local area networks that connect the components that deal with Octopus cards—turnstiles, Add Value Machines, value-checking machines and customer service terminals. Transactions from these stations are relayed to the MTR's Kowloon Bay headquarters through a frame relay wide area network, and hence onwards to the central clearing house system (CCHS) for clearing. Similar arrangements <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> for retailers such as 7-Eleven. Handheld devices are used to scan offline mobile readers, including those installed on minibuses. Buses either use handheld devices or a wireless system, depending on operator.|$|E

5|$|The insect {{was once}} {{commonly}} {{found throughout the}} Palearctic and was recognised across Eurasia, from France and England to China, but it was mainly in Central Europe where it was common enough to make its industrial use economically viable. Excessive economic exploitation {{as well as the}} shrinking and degradation of its habitat have made the Polish cochineal a rare species. In 1994, it was included in the Ukrainian Red Book of endangered species. In Poland, where it was still common in the 1960s, there is insufficient data to determine its conservation status, and no protective measures <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
5|$|Weston's first pier, Birnbeck Pier, {{standing}} on a small island {{to the north of}} the bay is currently closed to the public. The current owners, Manchester-based company Urban Splash purchased the pier in 2006. A competition was held as a means to encourage redevelopment of the site for commercial use. To date, no firm plans <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> and the future of Birnbeck Pier is uncertain. The pier houses Weston-super-Mare Lifeboat Station.|$|E
5|$|Muslim {{residents}} of Israel and Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are normally {{allowed to enter}} the Temple Mount and pray at the al-Aqsa Mosque without restrictions. Due to security measures, the Israeli government occasionally prevents certain groups of Muslims from reaching al-Aqsa by blocking the entrances to the complex; the restrictions vary from time to time. At times restrictions have prevented all men under 50 and women under 45 from entering, but married men over 45 are allowed. Sometimes the restrictions are enforced {{on the occasion of}} Friday prayers, other times they are {{over an extended period of}} time. Restrictions are most severe for Gazans, followed by restrictions on those from West Bank. The Israeli government states that the restrictions <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> for security reasons.|$|E

5|$|The birds breed {{easily in}} captivity and can lay eggs every 3 weeks between February and November. Once the female has one egg in her nest, {{she will not}} lay another. An egg takes about 30 days to hatch. The eyes of the young open around 3 weeks and the yellow down will show black pin {{feathers}} at about 6 weeks. The best time for hand raising is at about 10 weeks when their black feathers <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> but the tail feathers are still short. Young birds fledge after about 4 months and both sexes have the colouring of their mother. Mature male birds will become aggressive to young male birds at puberty (4 years); they must be separated if caged.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} age-related RMS decline in humans {{has been the}} subject of {{significant}} debate. The decline of neurogenesis in and migration from the hippocampus in humans has already been well documented. Furthermore, age-related declines in the activities of SVZ stem cells, which migrate to the OB via the RMS, <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> by middle age in rodents. In elderly mice, studies showed that the population of actively dividing SVZ cells and the rate of interneuron replacement in the OB are both drastically reduced, indicating an age-related decline in neuronal proliferation and migration through the RMS. This decline was shown to be due to neuronal stem cell quiescence in the SVZ even by middle age, and not destruction, much like in the hippocampus.|$|E
