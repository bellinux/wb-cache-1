40|$|AbstractEvery citizen has {{to right}} to move {{throughout}} a city safely and independently. The term accessibility refers this right in built environment mostly for public uses. In {{the beginning of}} 20 th century, accessibility started from a restricted application but nowadays it became more comprehensive due {{to a better understanding}} of physical barriers in the world. According to a recent research, designers are not aware of how <b>architectural</b> barriers restrict <b>accessibility</b> for different users. It should not be forgotten that accessibility for everyone will increase the whole citizens’ quality of life. Thus, the paper tries to show importance of raising awareness in design studios for better implementing accessibility for all people. In our urban design studio, a strong relationship has been found between accessible design solutions and students’ awareness about physical barriers. The paper concludes that there is an immediate need to elaborate design courses with universal design principles...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} related with a {{research}} that was aimed to better define urban quality and sustainability at a district scale (4000 - 10000 inhabitants), specifically referred to European towns and settlements. An innovative set of indicators (72) has been developed, starting from and {{taking into consideration}} also existing literature, {{both in terms of}} indicators and sets of indicators (OECD, UN, Agenda 21, and existing European databases as CRISP), four “thematic” areas have been defined dealing with <b>architectural</b> quality, <b>accessibility,</b> environment and services. Within each of these areas some macroindicators and micro-indicators have been defined. The aim is to translate something that is usually considered subjective into something “objective” and finally defined with a number (0 - 100). Microindicators and macro-indicators are weighted thanks to a mathematical method based on symmetrical matrixes, so that there is a correct balance between different areas. Indicators are both qualitative and quantitative, so they are not just referred to urban planning procedures. The research has been already successfully applied to some Italian districts in towns as Lodi, Genova and Milano. The set of indicators was needed also to work within a multi disciplinary team that has already included engineers, architects, planners as well as doctors and physicians. As a matter of fact the results in terms of urban quality have been compared with medical results concerning health and wellness perception (using SF- 36 international recognized questionnaires) by users (inhabitants), finding (non linear) relationships between urban quality and well being perception by inhabitants. The results of this research can be used to: better define design strategies (by designers) accordingly to users wellness, or evaluate ex-post the results of design activities (by municipalities or public authorities) ...|$|R

To perform this task, the system needs a set of georeferenced data that is dense enough and trustworthy enough to avoid false positives and negatives, e. g. to prevent users from encounter on their path an unknown barrier or a non-existing facility. In order to reach this goal, we propose a trustworthiness assessment which combines accuracy of sensors, source credibility of the crowd and the authority of experts. To evaluate the effectiveness of our trustworthiness assessment, we conducted a set of simulations by exploiting OSM data and we have obtained interesting results...|$|E

40|$|To our colleagues: Access Compliance {{has put the}} {{statutes}} and regulations contained in this publication together for your convenience. We hope that this book of regulations and statutes together will help clarify the obligations for <b>architectural</b> <b>accessibility</b> in California. While reading {{the statutes}}, {{keep in mind that}} these are only a partial listing of the statutory sections, and are included here because of their important role in setting forth the legislative ambition to provide and maintain an access code. Such statutes promulgate building regulations by a formal public consensus process, and are designed to carry out the intent of the legislature. Therefore, compliance with both statutes and regulations are necessary for complete implementation of the scheme for access in California. When the statutes indicate a performance obligation and the regulations are not sufficiently prescriptive, or where the regulations themselves are not clearly specific, remember that the overall solution should recognize the intent of statute. In other words, performance obligations set out in the statutes should be given due consideration, and the general trend is that a liberal application of the regulations should be taken to effect the purpose of statute...|$|E
40|$|Designing {{software}} architectures {{to facilitate}} accessible Web applications The Web application is increasingly {{a platform of}} choice for complex business software and online services. However, it remains a challenge {{to ensure that the}} Web application is easy, efficient, and effective for people with disabilities. Accessibility requires that users with disabilities, including those who are blind, have low vision, or have mobility impairments, are able to use the applications effectively and with a reasonable amount of effort. Although there has been important progress in recent years in describing the relationship between architecture and usability, the topic of <b>architectural</b> support for <b>accessibility</b> has not been adequately addressed. Based on our experience in designing Web applications for the United States Social Security Administration, we have begun to identify guidelines for architectures that support accessibility. This paper describes common accessibility problems encountered in Web applications and explains how architecture can help address these problems through reusable accessible objects, supplementing information in links, buttons, and labels, assisting in access to Web page visual information, handling errors, and providing time-out notification and recovery. It also discusses the critical role of architecture in supporting the best way of meeting the needs of diverse user groups: multiple dynamic views of the user interface...|$|R
40|$|Urbanization brings {{substantial}} {{pressure on}} housing {{production in the}} Helsinki metropolitan area {{over the next few}} decades. City growth logic has also changed towards densification urban structure. The densification of the urban structure affects in many ways the existing residential areas. One of the main issues of the urban growth is how the quality factors can be maintained or how they can be improved, while new housing will be built in different areas. The price of dwelling is generally considered to be a sum of the three main group of factors - location, structural characteristics and quality of neighborhood of the dwelling. This dissertation studies three factors affecting housing prices: urban natural amenities, <b>architectural</b> quality and <b>accessibility.</b> Contribution of the various features of the apartment housing prices can be examined empirically using the so-called hedonic price method. As regards urban natural amenities, the research focuses on green space and recreational areas as well as unbuilt areas in general. In addition to land use variables, the price effects of urban natural amenities are analysed through distance-based variables. Despite the abundance of green space in Helsinki, urban nature can be identified to have a clear positive effect on housing prices. Concerning architectonic quality, the results indicate that architectonic landmarks, for example, {{have a positive effect on}} prices of dwellings in their vicinity. The appreciation of the Art Nouveau style (Jugendstil) is also confirmed by the results. With regard to the accessibility of workplaces, the two alternative measures to the conventional CBD distance – accessibility to all workplaces and the number of workplaces within a 30 -minute travel time range – each produce results that have approximately the same explanatory power. A significant finding is that accessibility to workplaces by public transport has a considerably stronger impact on housing prices compared to accessibility by car...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho objetivou conhecer a forma como pessoas com deficiÃncia visual sentem, pensam e agem na cidade de Fortaleza. A deficiÃncia foi abordada como uma construÃÃo social e nÃo apenas como uma limitaÃÃo sensorial. Com base nos aportes teÃricos da Psicologia social e {{ambiental}} compreende-se o homem como ser histÃrico, social e ativo que interrelaciona-se com seu entorno sÃcio-fÃsico transformando-o e sendo por ele transformado. O estudo questionou o impacto das vivÃncias urbanas das pessoas com deficiÃncia visual como afetos potencializadores ou despotencializadores de sua aÃÃo na cidade. A teoria da afetividade e o conceito de estima de lugar orientaram a compreensÃo da relaÃÃo dos indivÃduos com a cidade, apontando inclusive para a escolha da metodologia de investigaÃÃo. A partir da aplicaÃÃo do Instrumento Gerador dos Mapas Afetivos (Bomfim, 2003) propÃs-se a construÃÃo de imagens tÃteis da cidade utilizando-se materiais para modelagem e montagem, tais como algodÃo, canudos, barbante, massa de modelar dentre outros. Foram consultadas 37 pessoas com deficiÃncia visual total e parcial de ambos os sexos. Os resultados indicaram a construÃÃo de quatro imagens de Fortaleza: InseguranÃa, Contraste, DestruiÃÃo e Agradabilidade. As mÃs condiÃÃes de acessibilidade arquitetÃnica e atitudinal em Fortaleza foram enfatizadas como elementos que trazem mais inseguranÃa aos participantes do que a violÃncia e a criminalidade, gerando medo de deslocar-se pela cidade. Apesar da elevada incidÃncia de sentimentos despotencializadores os respondentes tambÃm identificaram pontos positivos em suas experiÃncias, os quais estÃo ligados principalmente ao gosto pelos locais pÃblicos como praias e shoppings; pelos lugares de intimidade, integrantes das vivÃncias cotidianas dos participantes e pela convivÃncia social com pessoas prÃximas e com os demais habitantes da cidade. Conclui-se que a riqueza de informaÃÃes obtidas a partir de referÃncias nÃo visuais permite uma compreensÃo integral da cidade, ainda que a pesquisa tenha evidenciado que o pÃblico consultado tem leituras e necessidades especÃficas quanto ao ambiente urbano, que nÃo sÃo supridas em Fortaleza, visto que a estima de lugar despotencializadora obteve mais respostas do que a estima de lugar potencializadora. This paper aims {{to study}} the way visually impaired people feel, think and act {{in the city of}} Fortaleza. The impairment has been considered as a social subject and not only as a sensorial restriction. Based on the theoretical inputs of social and environmental Psychology, this work considers the individual as a historical, social and emotional being, who establishes a relationship with his/her physical and social environment, transforming it and being transformed by it. This study questions the impact of the urban experiences from visually impaired people as emotional intensifiers (or not) of their actions in the city. The affective theory and the concept of esteem of place have guided the comprehension of the individualsâ relationship with the city, inclusively guiding us in the choice of the study methodology. By applying the generator instrument of affective maps (Bomfim, 2003), we proposed the construction of tactile images of the city, using molding and assembly materials, such as cotton, straws, strings, play dough and others. Thirty-seven visually impaired people with complete and partial blindness, from both genders, were consulted. The results indicated the construction of four images of the city of Fortaleza: Insecurity,Contrast, Destruction and pleasantness. The bad conditions on <b>architectural</b> and attitude <b>accessibility</b> in Fortaleza were emphasized as elements that cause much more insecurity to the contestants than the violence or the crime rate, causing a fear of moving through the city. Despite of the high occurrence of disempowering feelings, the respondents also identified positive aspects on their experiences, which are especially connected with the taste for public places, such as beaches and shopping malls; and for intimacy places, {{that are part of the}} contestantsâ daily experiences and with social living with close friends and other in habitants of the city. The study concludes that the abundance of information which was gotten by the non-visual references allows us to have a full understanding of the city, even though the research had highlighted that the contestants have specific comprehensions and needs in relation to the urban environment, that are not fulfilled on Fortaleza, since the negative esteem of place has obtained more answers than the positive esteem of the place...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} disability, which is well {{accepted}} {{around the world}} and seem to be a statement of positive discrimination at first, requires to become a current issue as an equality problem in architecture and society today. In fact, the definition of disability and its intellectual basis are major and still invisibile obstacles to obtain equal rights for everyone regarding <b>architectural</b> <b>accessibility</b> and participation in social life. In this study, the intellectual basis of the concept of disability in social understanding has been explored to identify the main problem. It has been realised that this understanding, which is to be seen also in architectural practices, has occured as an issue of power and ideology. On one hand, the society itself generates the definitions, classifies people and creates hegemony based on consent, {{and on the other hand}} speaks up for resolving the problems caused by this classifications with a total inactivity. Strong ideologies, which ignore the problems of existing definitions, forms absolute truths and minds unable to question. Therefore, the definition of “disabled” becomes approved by the entire society, although it does not include inseperable parts of society such as children, patients or elderly. These ideologies result in a communal power created by free will insted of enforcement. In this manner, even individuals classified as “disabled” accept the legitimacy of this authority. However, existing of such an accepted definiton causes otherizing and ignorance in society. It also affects architectural perception and plays a significant role in creating isolation projects such as “disabled-friendly houses” or “libraries for disabled”. These projects show that people defined as “disabled” are the dark subconsciousness of society willing to be forgotten. When it is realised that the unity of differences creates the society, the classification will be forgotten, environments and mentallities will be shaped accordingly and designs will be created for everyone instead of designing for disabled. Bringing an accurate and fair point of view into existence, which is based on the mentioned facts, is the only way to solve the current problems in architectural practices and social inequalities...|$|E
