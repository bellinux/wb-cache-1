Exchange is studied especially as the way of acquisition of periodical publications, together with the methods and dealings used in the process of exchange. The "rules" which would facilitate a successful and high quality exchange are analyzed, and it is stated that it should follow the direction of developing library holdings and the needs of the user. The need for improving this part of business through introduction of automation and the transparency of information about exchange via announcement on web pages of the institutions/ libraries is especially emphasized. The exchange in the University Library in Zadar is presented and analyzed. It shows the share of exchange in the total acquisition and its successfulness according to the library holdings profile and the needs of the user. It is concluded that good organization and the strategy of exchange among libraries can be a very important factor in the development of collections of periodical publications.

40|$|Formal <b>acquisitions</b> <b>profiles</b> {{are widely}} used by {{academic}} libraries {{in the management of}} their collections; {{for the most part they}} are regarded as not only useful but essential. In the mid- 1990 s there was a boom in the standardization of acquisitions criteria, initiated by the Collections Development Group of the German Library Institute and incorporating the American Conspectus model, employing individual subject-based indicators. The following paper will highlight several aspects of formal <b>acquisitions</b> <b>profiles</b> currently under discussion, drawing on a number of selected examples. It will be shown that such policies are much more than a mere aid to literature selection. They are a planning instrument and can form the basis of the library’s public relations activities. Funding bodies, users, other libraries and the library itself are targeted by the acquisitions programme in equal measure. A 21 st century <b>acquisitions</b> <b>profile</b> is a collections management instrument, incorporating stock evaluation capability, cooperative acquisitions potential and special aspects concerning digital resources whilst ensuring that the library maintains a visible presence within the research landscape.

40|$|In last decades {{microfluidics}} {{has gained}} an increasing interest by {{the scientific community}} due to its capability of control liquids on the microscale. Especially, droplet microfluidics technology provides a high manipulation level on very small volumes of fluids. This feature makes it a promising candidate for biological, medical and chemistry applications. With a compact and simple microfluidic device, droplets can be coalesced, mixed, sorted and employed either as micro chemical reactors or as carriers of biological sample. From the experimental point of view {{there are many ways}} to produce and see micro droplets. The device used for this thesis consists of an opto-microfluidic chip made of lithium niobate, in which are integrated a microfluidic circuit and an optical waveguide, normal to the channel and produced by titanium diffused in lithium niobate. Droplets flowing in the channel are detected using a laser light transmitted in the optical waveguide. After having illuminated the microfluidic channel, where a ”train” of water droplets in oil pass through, the light is collected by another waveguide facing on the other side of the channel: the intensity transmitted is recorded by way of a tailored electronic circuit. The water droplet in oil makes the signal of the light transmitted beam change in intensity, from a fixed value, relative to oil, to another basically due to the different refractive index of the droplet respect the surrounding flux. The signal variation is not sharp, but is preceded by a peak of intensity. Thus, the <b>acquisition</b> <b>profile</b> of the transmitted light intensity identifies the phenomenon of droplet passage, but up to now no studies were reported from a theoretical point of view. In this thesis, we aimed to clarify this aspect and provide a fine comprehension of it. Therefore, we correlated the curves obtained to some physical parameters of the droplets and to give a theoretical explanation to the shape of such a profile. Since the length and the velocity of the droplets are proportional to the ratio of the liquids’ fluxes flowing in the microfluidic channel, it is possible to measure and analyse the effect of the droplet passage and find new physical observables to identify the droplet, its shape and relative velocity. In particular, since the optical transmitted light across the droplet presents intensity modulation, great care was devoted to identifying their origin and their systematic behaviour. The aim was that of relating the modulation intensity peaks to the meniscus of the droplet and then to investigate all the other zones in its middle with an accurate phenomenological analysis. The idea that features in the light transmitted intensity signal could be related with the meniscus of the droplet, as well as intuitive, has never proved in literature and has confirmed by a simulation carried out in the frame of this thesis. In fact, a theoretical analysis of this phenomena is made: assuming ray optic, two-dimensional version of the problem and after having chosen the best shape for the source, a program that simulate the passage of a droplet in the microfluidic channel was written. After having simulates the physical interaction between the droplet that advances in the channel and the light exiting the waveguide, the software computes the transmitted intensity in order to reproduce the <b>acquisition</b> <b>profile.</b> The numerical profiles thus obtained are reported and commented, also by varying the parameters of the simulation. Finally, comparisons between the results of the simulations and the experimental profiles enable us to understand better the shape of the droplet. Based on these results we analysed also the shape that the interface water-oil should be in order to reproduce the low transmitted intensity typical of the droplet's centre. Performing an accurate analysis over a wide range of the fluxes ratio ϕ=Q_oil/Q_water also the role of the so called "secondary peaks" is investigated and fingerprints for a detailed description of the transmitted intensity profile are provided. This, up to our knowledge, has not been investigated yet. Finally, we can identify the droplet passage, so that to estimate its length with perspectives of setting up an automatized and fast data analysis procedure. This feature exploits an integrated opto-microfluidic device, independent from the standard imagining processes and with the possibility to perform a feedback loop with manipulation stages. Moreover, the same measures, with a one-to-one comparison with synchronous acquisitions of microscope images of the droplets, let us investigate also the sensibility of the optical transmitted light from the overall geometrical shape of the droplet. New physical observables in the <b>acquisition</b> <b>profile</b> allow us to describe and identify the transition from different production regimes of the droplets, also in different geometrical configuration of the microchannels, in a more accurate way than other imaging technique presented in literature...|$|E
40|$|While {{there has}} been {{research}} on the diffusion of {{a particular type of}} innovation, few if any studies have examined the acceptance of a set of innovations (behavioral innovativeness) over time. This study using the Rasch methodology found evidence that computer hardware innovations are adopted in a particular order. The same could not be said for computer software, whose acceptance may be application based. This study applied a theoretical framework based on the diffusion of innovation literature (See Rodgers 1995). Data was collected via a telephone survey of 302 computer users. Scores obtained from Rasch analysis were used as the dependent variable (that of behavioral innovativeness) in a regression analysis, against factors such as overall innovativeness, use innovativeness, opinion leadership/acceptance, product class knowledge and use of sources of information. Determinates of the level of behavioral innovativeness were found to be personality traits of innovateness, (a willingness to trial new technology) and use innovateness (how innovatively existing information technology was used). The level of recent purchases in the last month of information technology items, a measure of leading edge use was also positively associated with acceptance of new technology. The research findings suggest that computer hardware manufacturers can assume that there is an order of acceptance of new technology and so can predict from the knowledge of existing hardware the acceptance of innovations in the future. Computer manufacturers can also effectively target early adopters of their technology given the results of this study. Rasch modeling can also be beneficial for organizations wishing to market diverse computer packages to users, as it allows a numerical scoring of a users <b>acquisition</b> <b>profile</b> or use of information technologies. 17 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{examines}} {{the production of}} definite and indefinite articles in English-speaking typically developing (TD) children and children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). Twenty four English-speaking children with SLI (mean age: 7; 5), twenty nine TD age-matched (TD-AM) children (mean age: 7; 5) and eleven younger (mean age: 5; 5) TD vocabulary-matched (TD-VM) children participated in a production task involving short stories without picture props based on Schafer and de Villiers (2000). Article production was examined in two different semantic contexts for the definite article, namely in the anaphoric and the bridging context. In the anaphoric condition, definiteness is established via linguistic means, whereas in the bridging condition via shared world knowledge. Indefinite article production was examined in the referential specific, non-referential predicational, and non-referential instrumental contexts. The referential specific context involves [+speaker, −hearer] knowledge and the non-referential predicational and instrumental [−speaker, −hearer] knowledge. Results showed that in the definite article contexts, all three groups performed better on the bridging compared with the anaphoric condition; in the indefinite article contexts, they had better performance on the non-referential predicational vs. the referential specific and the non-referential instrumental conditions. In terms of errors, the TD-VM children and the children with SLI produced significantly more substitutions than the TD-AM children in the definite article contexts. In the indefinite article contexts, the three {{groups did not differ}} in terms of accuracy or error patterns. The present results point towards problems in the discourse integration of entities {{that are part of the}} speaker's and hearer's knowledge in children with SLI and TD-VM controls, especially in definite articles.
