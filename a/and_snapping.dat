5|$|Adult {{pelicans}} rely on visual {{displays and}} behaviour to communicate, particularly using their wings and bills. Agonistic behaviour consists of thrusting <b>and</b> <b>snapping</b> at opponents with their bills, or lifting and waving their wings in a threatening manner. Adult pelicans grunt when at the colony, but are generally silent elsewhere or outside breeding season. Conversely, colonies are noisy as chicks vocalise extensively.|$|E
5|$|The American white ibis is territorial, {{defending}} the nesting and display sites against intruders. Agonistic or threat displays include lunging {{forward with the}} bill in a horizontal posture, and standing upright <b>and</b> <b>snapping</b> the bill opposite another bird engaging in the same display. Birds also lunge and bite, often holding onto an opponent's head or wings.|$|E
5|$|The apex nest predators of the American {{black duck}} include American crows, gulls and raccoons, {{especially}} in tree nests. Great horned owls {{are also a}} major predator of adults. Bullfrogs <b>and</b> <b>snapping</b> turtles eat many ducklings. Ducklings often catch diseases caused by protozoan blood parasites transmitted by bites of insects such as blackflies. They are also vulnerable to lead shot poisoning, known as plumbism, due to their bottom-foraging food habits.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} estimate the Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Autonomic Nervous System components (SNAS <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> respectively) by using an indicator obtained from surface ECGs. The long-term goal of the project is to quantitatively analyze the ratio between SNAS <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> {{in order to better}} characterize certain pathologies. An approach based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA), which exploits the di erent activation delays of SNAS <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> is proposed <b>and</b> applied to a database with normal subjects and diabetic patients. Preliminary results show a good separation, in the frequency domain, of SNAS <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> dynamics, including a di erentiation of SNAS <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> in the low-frequency band. Results are promising for a better quanti cation of the autonomic state of the patients...|$|R
5000|$|SNIP <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> - A pair of robo-Snorks, with SNIP being male <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> female.

After {{successfully}} framing Corky and making him leave, they allow Bigweed and Lil Seaweed to take over Snorkland. Then with a change of heart <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> being dismantled by a furious Lil Seaweed, SNIP helps Corky and Allstar's gang get rid of Bigweed and Lil Seaweed.

After the game, NFL owners approved the sale of the team by Lerner to Jimmy Haslam, a truck-stop magnate, for about $1 billion. In his first move as owner, Haslam announced that Holmgren would retire after the season and that Joe Banner, a former Eagles executive, would be appointed as the team's chief executive.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} wildflower {{species in the}} uplands and rock outcroppings of the Turkey Hill Oxbow. These include white baneberry, northern maidenhair fern, spikenard, blue cohosh, foamflower, false Solomon's seal, purple trillium, and wild columbine. Animals inhabiting the areas surrounding the pools include pickerel frogs, green frogs, wood ducks, <b>and</b> <b>snapping</b> turtles. Plants in this location include broadleaf arrowhead, northern blueflag, manna grasses, water starwort, and several varieties of sedges. Japanese knotweed has been seen near Interstate 80 on the northern edges of the Turkey Hill Oxbow.|$|E
5|$|Until {{recently}} {{it was thought}} that albatrosses were predominantly surface feeders, swimming at the surface <b>and</b> <b>snapping</b> up squid and fish pushed to the surface by currents, predators, or death. The deployment of capillary depth recorders, which record the maximum dive depth undertaken by a bird, has shown that while some species, like the wandering albatross, do not dive deeper than a metre, some species, like the light-mantled albatross, have a mean diving depth of almost 5m and can dive as deep as 12.5m. In addition to surface feeding and diving, they have also been observed plunge diving from the air to snatch prey.|$|E

5|$|Visual {{displays}} mostly {{occur in}} agonistic situations. Elephants {{will try to}} appear more threatening by raising their heads and spreading their ears. They may add to the display by shaking their heads <b>and</b> <b>snapping</b> their ears, as well as throwing dust and vegetation. They are usually bluffing when performing these actions. Excited elephants may raise their trunks. Submissive ones will lower their heads and trunks, as well as flatten their ears against their necks, while those that accept a challenge will position their ears in a V shape.|$|E
5|$|At 13:00, {{two ships}} {{emerged from the}} gloom {{to the east and}} Lacrosse turned away rather than risk his {{passengers}} in a pointless engagement. The ships persisted and were soon revealed to be the frigates Indefatigable under Captain Sir Edward Pellew, and Amazon under Captain Robert Carthew Reynolds, which had taken on supplies at Falmouth and then returned to their station off Brest. As Droits de l'Homme steered southwest, the winds increased once more and the sea became choppy, preventing Lacrosse from opening the gunports on his lower deck without severe risk of flooding <b>and</b> <b>snapping</b> his topmasts, which reduced his ship's stability. Realising his opponent's difficulties, Pellew closed with the larger ship and began a heavy fire. At 18:45, Amazon came within range and the frigates combined to repeatedly rake the French ship. The combat continued throughout the night, punctuated by short breaks in which the more mobile British ships repaired their battle damage out of range of Lacrosse's guns.|$|E
5|$|Like all Australasian robins, {{the flame}} robin is a perch and pounce hunter, mainly eating insects, and often {{returning}} to a favourite low perch several times to stand erect and motionless, scanning the leaf-litter for more prey. They are typically seen in pairs (during {{the spring and summer}} breeding season) or in loose companies in more open country in winter, when they more commonly feed on the ground. A field study in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales found no significant difference in foraging behaviour between male and female flame robins. Birds have been recorded foraging for insects in furrows in freshly ploughed fields. In Deniliquin, a flame robin was observed holding one foot forward and pattering the ground repeatedly to disturb ground-dwelling insects, and then watching <b>and</b> <b>snapping</b> up any which emerged; this behaviour is otherwise seen in waders.|$|E

50|$|On Ethernet, the 8 octets {{occupied}} by the LLC <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> headers {{reduce the size of}} the available payload for protocols such as the Internet Protocol to 1492 bytes, compared {{to the use of the}} Ethernet II framing; therefore, for protocols that have EtherType values, packets are usually transmitted with Ethernet II headers rather than with LLC <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> headers. On other network types, the LLC <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> headers are required in order to multiplex different protocols on the link layer, as the MAC layer doesn't itself have an EtherType field, so there's no alternative framing that would have a larger available payload.|$|R
5|$|Spinner sharks feed {{primarily}} on small bony fish, including tenpounders, sardines, herring, anchovies, sea catfish, lizardfish, mullets, bluefish, tunas, bonito, croakers, jacks, mojarras, and tongue-soles. They {{have also been}} known to eat stingrays, cuttlefish, squid, and octopus. Groups of spinner sharks are often found pursuing schools of prey at high speed. Individual prey are seized and swallowed whole, as this shark lacks cutting dentition. This species employs an unusual tactic when feeding on schools of small fish; the shark charges vertically through the school, spinning on its axis with its mouth open <b>and</b> <b>snapping</b> all around it. The shark's momentum {{at the end of}} these spiraling runs often carries it into the air, giving it its common name. The blacktip shark also performs this behavior, though not as often. Off Madagascar, spinner sharks follow migrating schools of mackerel, tunas, and jacks. Like blacktip sharks, they congregate around shrimp trawlers to feed on the discarded bycatch, and may be incited into feeding frenzies.|$|E
5|$|Newly hatched New Guinea {{crocodiles}} feed on aquatic insects, spiders, tadpoles, freshwater snails, frogs, {{fish and}} small mammals. As they grow, {{so does the}} size of their prey and their consumption of fish rises, but they still will eat anything of a worthwhile size that they can find. An adult's diet is largely fish, caught by sweeping the snout sideways <b>and</b> <b>snapping</b> at the prey, but also includes shrimps, crabs, frogs, snakes, birds and medium-sized mammals. A crocodile catches its prey by stealth with a flick of its head, impaling it with its sharp teeth and gripping and crushing it. The jaws cannot move sideways to chew the food; instead, the crocodile's head is tossed to move the prey {{to the back of the}} mouth before the prey is swallowed whole. This crocodile is surprisingly agile and can lunge its body upward into the air to catch bats, flying birds, and leaping fish. It can also probe into the mud at the bottom of a river or swamp with its snout to search for crabs and molluscs.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{continued}} northeast, becoming {{large and}} wedge-shaped. It then passed {{just north of}} Fairview, completely destroying multiple homes and debarking numerous hardwood trees. Pieces of debris were found speared through vehicles in this area. The tornado then briefly passed through a section of Morgan County {{near the town of}} Hulaco, destroying several older block-foundation homes <b>and</b> <b>snapping</b> numerous large trees off at the base. The tornado then crossed into Marshall County and impacted the rural community of Ruth, just north of Arab. A large but poorly-anchored brick home was swept completely away in this area, with the debris scattered 100 yards from the foundation. Several large trees on the property were ripped out of the ground and missing, along with a trailer that was unable to be located {{at the time of the}} survey. Multiple other homes and structures were impacted in the Ruth area, and a gas station was completely destroyed. A shed was destroyed with pieces of large farm machinery stored inside thrown up to 20 yards away, a storage trailer was tossed 100 yards and found impaled by multiple planks of wood, and concrete power poles in the area were bent over. Arab's power grid was completely crippled by the tornado's effects, and many roads in the area were obstructed by downed trees and power lines. The tornado damaged and destroyed several other homes, garages, and sheds north of Union Grove before it crossed the Tennessee River, snapping numerous trees in a forested area before dissipating.|$|E

40|$|The hormones {{atrial natriuretic peptide}} (ANP) {{and brain}} natriuretic peptide (BNP) are stored and {{secreted}} by cardiac myocytes. To date, there is little information reported regarding the cellular mechanisms regulating the release of these hormones. Recent studies have identified soluble N-ethyl-maleimide-sensitive-fusion attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) in the trafficking, docking and fusion of ANP and BNP secretory vesicles. In this study, I characterized the expression profiles of the three SNARE proteins (syntaxin 5 A, syntaxin 18, <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> 29), implicated in constitutive exocytosis, in atrial and ventricular cardiac myocytes. My results suggest that syntaxin 5 A, syntaxin 18 <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> 29 are not important in the constitutive secretion of ANP and {{may play a role}} in another protein trafficking pathway. Syntaxin 1 A <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> 25, two SNARE proteins previously characterized in atrial cardiac myocytes, form a complex in adults that has been implicated in the exocytosis of ANP. I investigated the protein expression and promoter activity of these two SNARE proteins in neonatal and adult atrial and ventricular cardiac myocytes. The functional role of syntaxin 1 A <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> 25 was assessed using botulinum neurotoxin C (BoNT/C) and BoNT/A which cleave these SNARE proteins, respectively. Treatment of cardiac myocytes with BoNT/A and BoNT/C suggest that syntaxin 1 A <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> 25 regulate ANP secretion in neonatal cardiac myocytes, albeit low levels. Lastly, I examined the influence of forskolin and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) on the syntaxin 1 A <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> 25 promoter. The lack of effect of these agents on gene reporter activity suggests that the CRE element in the syntaxin 1 A <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> 25 promoter do not significantly affect transcriptional activity. Overall, my studies demonstrate the developmental changes in SNARE protein expression in the heart, and their potential role in ANP secretion...|$|R
