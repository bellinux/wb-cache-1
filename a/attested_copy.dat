60|$|This is what {{concerns}} assent in matters wherein testimony is made use of: concerning which, I think, {{it may not}} be amiss to take notice of a rule observed in the law of England; which is, That though the <b>attested</b> <b>copy</b> of a record be good proof, yet the copy of a copy, ever so well attested, and by ever so credible witnesses, will not be admitted as a proof in judicature. This is so generally approved as reasonable, and suited to the wisdom and caution to be used in our inquiry after material truths, that I never yet heard of any one that blamed it. This practice, if it be allowable in the decisions of right and wrong, carries this observation along with it, viz. THAT ANY TESTIMONY, THE FURTHER OFF IT IS FROM THE ORIGINAL TRUTH, THE LESS FORCE AND PROOF IT HAS. The being and existence of the thing itself, is what I call the original truth. A credible man vouching his knowledge of it is a good proof; but if another equally credible do witness it from his report, the testimony is weaker: and a third that attests the hearsay of an hearsay is yet less considerable. So that in traditional truths, each remove weakens the force of the proof: and the more hands the tradition has successively passed through, the less strength and evidence does it receive from them. This I thought necessary to be taken notice of: because I find amongst some men the quite contrary commonly practised, who look on opinions to gain force by growing older; and what a thousand years since would not, to a rational man contemporary with the first voucher, have appeared at all probable, is now urged as certain beyond all question, only because several have since, from him, said it one after another. Upon this ground propositions, evidently false or doubtful enough in their first beginning, come, by an inverted rule of probability, to pass for authentic truths; and those which found or deserved little credit from the mouths of their first authors, are thought to grow venerable by age, are urged as undeniable.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} three papers {{investigating the}} mechanisms surrounding {{the exchange of}} petty bribes prevalent {{in many parts of}} the developing world. The first two papers utilise laboratory experiments to investigate the efficacy of a self-reporting mechanism in deterring the exchange of a petty bribe. In the final paper I conduct a natural field experiment in New Delhi, India where we directly observe bribes being requested. In the first paper my co-author and I investigate whether offering a monetary reward to whistle-blowers who report their own involvement in petty bribery is able to destabilise trust and deter agents from offering or accepting a bribe. The mechanism is not dissimilar to laws instituted in the United States and EU that extend full or partial leniency to whistle-blowers who report on their organisation’s involvement in forming a cartel. We conduct a laboratory study to test this mechanism and find the mechanism approximately halves the number of bribes being exchanged. This outcome arises despite the participants engaging with the same partners over several periods and potential payouts being significantly higher for agents to exchange bribes and favours over several periods without self-reporting. In the second paper I investigate whether the monetary reward for whistle-blowing is as effective in scenarios where agents do not anticipate interacting with one another repeatedly. This is more reflective of many interactions where individuals pay bribes to public officials but even if bribery is routine they seldom interact with the same public official repeatedly. As trust is more difficult to establish in such scenarios the base level of bribery exchange was anticipated to be lower which allowed the possibility that a reward for whistle-blowing would not further erode trust. The results reveal the whistle-blowing mechanism again approximately halves the level of bribes being exchanged despite a lower baseline incidence of bribes. In the final paper my co-authors and I directly approach notaries public in New Delhi and request they <b>attest</b> a <b>copy</b> of a document as being genuine. In a control treatment we check whether prices above the legal rate are demanded for legitimate requests. In further treatments we request the attestation be backdated (mildly illegitimate request) and certified when the copy is shown to be augmented from the original (highly illegitimate request). We observe only a low degree of overcharging in the control treatment but substantial bribes being demanded in the backdating treatment. About half of the notaries refuse to attest the augmented document but those who consent demand significantly higher bribes. We also study the effect of competition by comparing notaries at court (high competition) and in isolated home offices (low competition). Surprisingly, notaries with high competition demand higher bribes. We attribute this effect to the crowding out of altruism by competition...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{comparative analysis}} {{of the names of}} North Germanic origin in the Primary Chronicle. In Section 1, the author analyses the spelling of the names of the ambassadors who participated in the conclusion of the Treaty of Prince Igor with Byzantium (944) as <b>attested</b> in several <b>copies</b> of the Chronicle and suggests approximate reconstructions of the names’ Cyrillic spellings. Section 2 deals with the “Varangian” names from the Chronicle which have sound reflexes different from the known Scandinavian ones. In addition to the names of the ambassadors of 944, the author involves other North Germanic names found in the Primary Chronicle. The author argues that such deviations may reflect phonetical peculiarities of the North Germanic dialect spoken by the northern Germans who served in the “Scandinavian” druzhina of the Southern (Kievan) Russian princes until the 12 th century. Table 2 includes the “Varangian” names with the features of the postulated “Russian Varangian” dialect as compared to the Proto-Norse reconstructions and the known North Germanic names. Section 3 provides comparative analysis of phonetics of the “Varangian” names. The author concludes that most of these names do not belong to any of the known North Germanic languages. The phonology of the “Varangian” names indicates an early separation of the “Russian Varangian” dialect from the Proto-Norse stem. Table 4 presents regular reflexes of the Proto-North Germanic vowels in the “Russian Varangian” dialect. Section 4 is devoted to the annalistic names of Scandinavian origin that have vocalic reflexes different from the “Russian Varangian” ones. The author provides comparative analysis of this group of names as attested in the Primary Chronicle and Novgorod birchbark manuscripts (Tables 5 and 6). Finally, Table 7 represents an index “From Proto-North Germanic reconstructions to the ‘Varangian’ names” which includes both “Russian Varangian” names and annalistic names reflecting the phonology of other North Germanic languages and dialects of the 10 th– 12 th centuries...|$|R
