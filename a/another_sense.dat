25|$|Driscoll {{adheres to}} Reformed or Calvinist theology, {{although}} he characterizes his position specifically as New Calvinism to differentiate {{himself from the}} more cessationist and non-missional aspects associated historically with Calvinism. Driscoll denies the orthodox Calvinist view of limited atonement and believes instead that Jesus died for all people in some sense, and for some people (the elect) in <b>another</b> <b>sense.</b> He thinks this position was what John Calvin believed, saying in a humorous tone: 'Calvinism came after Calvin... I {{will argue that the}} Calvinists are not very Calvin. I will argue against Calvinism with Calvin... What kind of Calvinist are you? I'm a Calvin, not a Calvinist, that came later'. Driscoll also believes that this position (or slight variations thereof) was held by men like Charles Spurgeon, John Bunyan, Martin Luther, and Richard Baxter.|$|E

25|$|When {{it is not}} {{possible}} for a law to be authentically interpreted, recourse must be had to what is called magisterial, or doctrinal, interpretation, for which rules of law have been formulated. The words of a law must be understood according to their usual signification, unless it is certain that the legislator intended them to be taken in <b>another</b> <b>sense,</b> or the rules of law dictate another interpretation. In all interpretations, however, the meaning of the words is to be preferred which favours equity rather than strict justice. The provisions of a previous statute are not presumed to be changed beyond the express meaning of the words of a new law. No words of a law are ever presumed to be superfluous. In interpreting a law the words must be considered in their context. When the words of a law are doubtful the presumption is in favour of the subjects, not of the lawgiver.|$|E
25|$|Eventually {{the modern}} theory of quantum {{mechanics}} came to picture light as (in some sense) both a particle and a wave, and (in <b>another</b> <b>sense),</b> as a phenomenon which is neither a particle nor a wave (which actually are macroscopic phenomena, such as baseballs or ocean waves). Instead, modern physics sees light as {{something that can be}} described sometimes with mathematics appropriate to one type of macroscopic metaphor (particles), and sometimes another macroscopic metaphor (water waves), but is actually something that cannot be fully imagined. As in the case for radio waves and the X-rays involved in Compton scattering, physicists have noted that electromagnetic radiation tends to behave more like a classical wave at lower frequencies, but more like a classical particle at higher frequencies, but never completely loses all qualities of one or the other. Visible light, which occupies a middle ground in frequency, can easily be shown in experiments to be describable using either a wave or particle model, or sometimes both.|$|E

30|$|Au–Ag {{bimetallic}} catalysts have concerned {{much attention}} {{in recent years}} owing to their electronic, optical, and catalytic properties which {{differ from those of}} individual Au and Ag mono metals. Au–Ag bimetallic catalysts have been widely used for catalytic applications [44]. Reduced graphene oxide supported Au–Ag bimetallic catalyst was found to have higher electrocatalytic activity for glucose compare Au and Ag monometal catalysts [45]. In another study, grapheme was used for supporting of sonochemical synthesis of Au–Ag bimetallic nanoparticles to improve the catalytic activity of graphene oxide for investigation of 4 -nitrophenol [46]. Au–Ag alloy catalyst was also supported on mesoporous aluminosilicate for use in low-temperature CO oxidation with high stability [47].

[...] First among these he listed the peripatetic-thomist observation mentioned above, but he further observed that this link between sensory perception and intellectual conception is a two-way street. [...] That is, it can be taken to say that whatever we find in the intellect is also incipiently in the senses. [...] Hence, if theories are theory-laden then so are the senses, and perception itself {{can be seen as a}} species of abductive inference, its difference being that it is beyond control and hence beyond critique – in a word, incorrigible. [...] This in no way conflicts with the fallibility and revisability of scientific concepts, since it is only the immediate percept in its unique individuality or [...] "thisness" [...] – what the Scholastics called its haecceity – that stands beyond control and correction. [...] Scientific concepts, on the other hand, are general in nature, and transient sensations do in <b>another</b> <b>sense</b> find correction within them.

Lindsay did well in the early Arizona caucus, coming in second place behind Edmund Muskie of Maine and ahead of eventual nominee George McGovern of South Dakota. Then in the March 14 Florida primary, he placed a weak fifth place, behind George Wallace of Alabama, Muskie, Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, and Scoop Jackson of Washington (though he did edge out McGovern). Among his difficulties was New York City's worsening problems, which Lindsay was accused of neglecting; a band of protesters from Forest Hills, Queens, who were opposed to his support for a low income housing project in their neighborhood, followed Lindsay around his aborted campaign itinerary to jeer and heckle him. His poor showing in Florida effectively doomed his candidacy. New York City politician Meade Esposito called for Lindsay to end his campaign with the much-publicized comment [...] "I think the handwriting is on the wall; Little Sheba better come home."
