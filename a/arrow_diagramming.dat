An automated interpretation of <b>arrow</b> <b>diagrams</b> would be highly desirable in pen-based interfaces. This paper develops a method for deducing possible interpretations of <b>arrow</b> <b>diagrams,</b> which is composed of a uni-directional arrow symbol and one or more components. Based on {{a study of the}} use of <b>arrow</b> <b>diagrams,</b> we classify their semantics into properties, annotations, actions, and conjunctions. Then, we discuss the structural requirements of <b>arrow</b> <b>diagrams</b> for illustrating each class of semantics, as well as the structural rules for adding optional components.

40|$|The Critical Path Method (CPM) is {{a widely}} used tool {{throughout}} the construction industry. Since its creation, the use and application of the Critical Path Method has grown tremendously. Up to date, three studies have been performed on how Engineering News Record’s (ENR) Top 400 Contractor use CPM. The first study was performed by Edward Davis in 1974 and the second was performed by Amir Tavakoli and Roger Riachi in 1990. This paper is {{a summary of the}} third survey, which took place in 2003. The results from the three studies indicate that CPM use by the Top 400 Contractors is growing and the areas of use are expanding. The number one use of CPM throughout the years is detailed planning before the start of construction. Periodic control during construction is another large area of CPM use and has been a large area of growth due to the advances in technology, which make updating a schedule during construction easier and faster than was possible with a mainframe computer in the past. Another area of CPM growth is estimating and bidding for several reasons: use in this area has jumped from 19 % to 54 % in the past 30 years. An area of concern lately in CPM is the use of precedence diagramming instead of <b>arrow</b> <b>diagramming.</b> Despite the debate, the responding companies found precedence diagrams easier to read, provide more flexibility, and allow for easier use of “smart ” relationships (i. e. start-start). ii...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{traditional}} {{techniques for}} project scheduling such as <b>Arrow</b> <b>Diagramming</b> Method (ADM) and Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM) are continuously undergoing improvisation {{in order to}} replicate real-time construction scenario. Quite often, these methods are criticized for their limited information capturing ability. Relationship Diagramming Method (RDM) proposed by Plotnick in the recent past, is an improved variant of PDM, which can store additional information on relationships that would improve the scheduling process. In addition to basic data on the activities, additional information can be represented through five codes in RDM. Sequencing of activities in a construction project is primarily driven by the construction logic and/or the availability of resources. There is scope for arriving at alternate sequences with varying availability of resources to achieve the objectives of project scheduling {{as long as the}} construction logic is preserved. In order to achieve such a resource-constrained project scheduling, additional information on the restraints of the activities are necessary, which can be modelled using RDM through one of the five codes of RDM. The objective {{of this paper is to}} explore and exploit the Reason/Why code of RDM. The Reason and Why codes are associated with a restraint and for recording the description respectively. An activity's dependence on a resource has been captured using Reason/Why code in this study. It has been attempted to understand the impact of varying resource availability using an empirical equation on sequencing such resource dependent activities and its effect on critical path. The proposed concept is tested with data from a repetitive high rise construction project. The preliminary results have been well received...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the goals}} of systems biology is to reverse {{engineer}} in a comprehensive fashion the <b>arrow</b> <b>diagrams</b> of signal transduction systems. An important tool for ordering pathway components is genetic epistasis analysis, and here we present a strategy termed Alternative Inputs (AIs) to perform systematic epistasis analysis. An alternative input is defined as any genetic manipulation that can activate the signaling pathway instead of the natural input. We introduced the concept of an "AIs-Deletions matrix" that summarizes the outputs of all combinations of alternative inputs and deletions. We developed the theory and algorithms to construct a pairwise relationship graph from the AIs-Deletions matrix capturing both functional ordering (upstream, downstream) and logical relationships (AND, OR), and then interpreting these relationships into a standard <b>arrow</b> <b>diagram.</b> As a proof-of-principle, we applied this methodology to a subset of genes involved in yeast mating signaling. This experimental pilot study highlights the robustness of the approach and important technical challenges.

Then fuzzy logic was used for increase the yield of information of these tools. All three tools shown up to be flexible for fuzzy approach application. As the first, an application of an <b>arrow</b> <b>diagram</b> with a support of fuzzy logic to solution of mobile phone functionality problem at a service center for repair of mobile phones is presented. For the smooth course of negotiation between a client and the mobile phone reparation service {{there is a need}} to estimate the time of the problem solution as precisely as possible. Fuzzy logic as a supporter for an <b>arrow</b> <b>diagram</b> was used in order to determine the time interval of mobile reparation process more accurately in comparison with a standard approach. Better estimation of the time of a step “Diagnostics with the goal to find a cause of a problem” using the fuzzy logic is demonstrated. Then, an affinity diagram formed for a process of adhesive assembly of electronic components on the printed circuit board was constructed. Fuzzy approach showed the degree of an influence of the failures in some operations of the process to the failures in the following operations of this process. Non-obvious failures that could be met during a testing step were estimated and their significance was calculated. Process decision program chart (PDPC) created for assembly of electronic components on a printed circuit board based on wave soldering was also presented. The process decision program chart was constructed to identify risks and develop counter-measures (preventive actions). Volume of information, which should be involved into such the diagram, is very high. Fuzzy approach was used to find information of lower importance, which can occur, and thereby reduce the amount of entering information for processing of the PDPC diagram. The use of fuzzy logic is, with respect to the range of the thesis, documented on selected steps used in the processing of selected managerial quality control tools. The approach is generic and can be used for any technological or other type of an operation or a process to obtain deeper insight into the problem and better estimation of the course of an event under analysis.

40|$|Two new {{techniques}} for analyzing retinotopic maps— <b>arrow</b> <b>diagrams</b> and visual field sign maps—are demonstrated {{with a large}} electrophysiological mapping data set from owl monkey extrastriate visual cortex. An <b>arrow</b> <b>diagram</b> (vectors indicating receptive field centers placed at cortical coordinates) provides a more compact and understandable representation of retinotopy than does a standard receptive field chart (accompanied by a penetration map) or a double contour map (e. g., isoeccentricity and isopolar angle {{as a function of}} cortical x, y-coordinates). None of these three representational techniques, however, make separate areas easily visible, especially in data sets containing numerous areas with partial, distorted representations of the visual hemrfield. Therefore, we computed visual field sign maps (non-mirror-image vs mirror-image visual field representation) from the angle between the direction of the cortical gradient in receptive field eccentricity and the cortical gradient in receptive field angle for each small region of the cortex. Visual field sign is a local measure invariant to cortical map orientation and distortion but also to choice of receptive field coordinate system. To estimate the gradients, we first interpolated the eccentricity and polar angle data onto regular grids using a distance-weighted smoothing algorithm. The visual field sign technique provides a more objective method for using retinotopy to outline multiple visual areas. In order to relate these arrow and visual field sign maps accurately to architectonic features visualized in the stained, flattened cortex, we also developed a deformable template algorithm for warping the photograph-derived penetration map using the final observed location of a set of marking lesions...|$|R
