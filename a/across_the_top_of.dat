5|$|When {{manifested}} as a water horse {{the creature}} {{is able to}} gallop <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> lochs; the beating noise of the creature's hooves on the water {{is the same as}} if it were galloping on solid ground.|$|E
5|$|A {{generally}} malevolent entity, the boobrie typically preys on livestock being transported on ships, {{but it is}} also fond of otters, {{of which}} it consumes a considerable number. In its manifestation as a water horse the creature is able to gallop <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> lochs as if on solid ground. During the summer months it is seen infrequently as a large insect, sucking the blood of horses.|$|E
5|$|<b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> {{the ravine}} from Cave 1 {{on the other}} Stupa hill is a large hall known as Sitabai's temple cave. The portico has four pillars and two pilasters. The hall has 3 {{chambers}} at the back, the central one a shrine and the rest for monks or priests. The door of the central shrine has pilasters and a frieze, with the threshold decorated with lion figures. The sanctum has no image now, but is similar to Linga shrine on the island.|$|E
5000|$|Decorative garlanding hangs <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four poles, bearing summer fruits, {{especially}} {{grapes and}} peaches.|$|R
5000|$|A {{relatively}} recent {{addition to the}} site was {{the construction of a}} naturally composting pit toilet with a magnificent view down the Macalister River Valley and <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> nearby snowgums and mountain ridges. [...] The site is listed in the Victorian Heritage Register.|$|R
6000|$|... [91] The {{architrave}} {{is properly}} the horizontal piece of stone laid [...] <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pillars in Greek buildings, and commonly [...] marked with horizontal lines, obtained by slight projections of its [...] surface, {{while it is}} protected above in the richer orders, by a [...] small cornice.|$|R
5|$|The cloth {{support is}} visible {{in areas where the}} paint was thinly applied. Rusty nail holes {{can be seen in the}} lower border and <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the picture in an area of sky that was {{initially}} covered by frame. They indicate that the woodworking was positioned much lower than Bouts had intended; generally works painted on commission were placed by professional joiners who worked independently of the painter. The low placing of the frame however protected the underlying colours over the centuries from light; they are preserved as first laid down. The panel was originally attached to its frame by pegs and nails; the nails would have been used to attach the linen to the underlying wooden frame.|$|E
5|$|The {{head has}} {{a less than}} {{triangular}} shape with a blunt and rounded snout. Still, the head is much wider than the neck. The rostral scale is small. The circumorbital ring consists of 10–16 scales. <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the head, there are 7–11 interocular scales. 3–4 scales separate the suboculars and the supralabials. There are 12–17 supralabials and 13–17 sublabials. The first 3–4 sublabials contact the chin shields, of which {{there is only one}} pair. Often, there are two fangs on each maxilla and both can be functional.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{watertight}} bulkheads extended {{well above}} the water line, they were not sealed at the top. If too many compartments were flooded, the ship's bow would settle deeper in the water, and water would spill from one compartment to the next in sequence, rather like water spilling <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> an ice cube tray. This was what happened to Titanic, which had suffered damage to the forepeak tank, the three forward holds and No.6 boiler room, {{a total of five}} compartments. Titanic was only designed to float with any two compartments flooded, but it could remain afloat with certain combinations of three or even four compartments (the first four) open to the ocean. With five compartments, the tops of the bulkheads would be submerged and the ship would continue to flood.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Closeup {{of current}} {{position}} near perihelion, passing <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> side <b>of</b> this view ...|$|R
50|$|The motif {{was later}} used in neo-classical {{architecture}} and decorative arts, especially ceramics {{and the work}} of silversmiths. Variations on the exact design are plentiful; for example, the ribbons can be suspended either from a decorated knot, or held in the mouths of lions, or suspended <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> bucrania as in the Temple of Vesta at Tivoli.|$|R
60|$|They {{ran up the}} {{staysail}} and set the mizzen. Cayman leaped {{forward and}} the spray blew from her plunging bows. Her white wake trailed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seas astern, and the water that bubbled through the scuppers crept up her lee deck. For all that, the captain was not satisfied and he looked to windward, knitting his brows.|$|R
5|$|The HTC Dream was {{the first}} ever {{smartphone}} to ship with the Android operating system. The operating system heavily integrates with, and provides apps for various Google services, such as Gmail (with push email support), Maps, Search, Talk, and YouTube, while the contacts and calendar apps can sync with the online Google Contacts and Google Calendar services respectively. The device also ships with an email app supporting other POP3 and IMAP-based mail services, an instant messaging app with support for multiple services, and a WebKit-based web browser. A notification system displays icons for certain events (such as e-mails and text messages) {{on the left side}} of the status bar <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the screen; dragging down from the top of the screen exposes a tray with more detailed information for each notification. The Android Market can be used to download additional apps for the device. The G1 as sold by T-Mobile also shipped with an Amazon MP3 app, allowing users to purchase DRM-free music online, and download them straight to the device via Wi-Fi.|$|E
25|$|As both {{title and}} headline, Censorship Is The Shield Of The Corrupt appears <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> {{the black and}} white, banner-like composition.|$|E
25|$|Running {{hydration}} packs are {{the smallest}} and lightest, many under 2 litres and most under six litres. They sit low on your back. Compression straps <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> your body are common as are hip belts.|$|E
5000|$|Circular in design, this {{royal blue}} patch is edged {{with a black}} border. The {{prominent}} feature is a lunging, silver, three-headed dog. Behind the dog are three red columns resting on a red pedestal. <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> columns is a red lintel bearing the word [...] "Cerberus." [...] Silver bands edge the base and <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three columns. Behind the columns is a yellow fire accented with red.|$|R
50|$|Gutter guards (also called gutter covers, gutter {{protection}} or leaf guards) {{are primarily}} aimed at preventing damage caused from clogged gutters {{and reducing the}} need for regular gutter cleaning. They are a common add-on or included as an option for custom-built homes. Forms include wire mesh <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> guttering, lengths of spiked plastic, or reverse curves in the gutter design to catch water but not falling objects.|$|R
5000|$|Resting on {{the columns}} is the entablature which {{itself can be}} split into three main parts. The architrave, the main {{spanning}} beam <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pillars. Above the architrave is the frieze, the central patterned section. Then the cornice is the upper part which projects outwards. Finally, the pediments are the triangular facings {{at each end of}} the Monument. One of the pillars contains a spiral staircase to a walkway around <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monument.|$|R
25|$|After {{withdrawing}} from the most exposed positions on the hill, the new front line ran <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the hill {{from east to west}} and was held by the 4th Battalion Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, the Wellington, Canterbury and Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiments.|$|E
25|$|After the dam's {{reconstruction}} in 1926, {{workers and}} local people {{were permitted to}} walk <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the dam {{as a means of}} getting to work and school. For security reasons, the Montana Power Company closed the dam to such foot traffic during World War II and never allowed it to resume afterward.|$|E
25|$|Horsemen in the Sassanid cavalry {{lacked a}} stirrup. Instead, {{they used a}} war saddle which had a cantle at the back and two guard clamps which curved <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the rider's thighs. This allowed the {{horsemen}} {{to stay in the}} saddle at all times during the battle, especially during violent encounters.|$|E
5000|$|Late 1990s - An English Heritage {{investigation}} found that Milecastle 9 {{was one of}} only 14 milecastles on cultivated land and that only it and Milecastle 19 were being damaged by farming. [...] Milecastle 9 suffered plough scores <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surviving walls (the south side lying under a farmer's field). [...] It was concluded {{that the only way to}} prevent future plough damage is to take the land out of cultivation.|$|R
5000|$|The term {{can also}} be applied to all sides, {{including}} the vertical members, of a frame with mouldings around a door or window. The word architrave {{is also used to}} refer more generally to a style of mouldings (or other elements) framing <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a door, window or other rectangular opening, where the horizontal [...] "head" [...] casing extends <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertical side casings where the elements join (creating a butt joint, as opposed to a miter joint).|$|R
40|$|Photograph of John Parkinson residence, St. Paul Street & 6 th Street, ca. 1910. The {{rectangular}} {{house with}} flat roof and jutting eaves sits atop a rise. A long set of stairs {{lead up to}} the house from the sidewalk. A garage or carriage house sits to the left. Trees run <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rise adjacent to the 2 -story house. A gated drive curves up the rise between the garage and the stairs.; Streetscape.

25|$|The public {{used to be}} able to walk <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> Holter Dam (which {{provided}} {{easy access}} to both sides of the river), but the dam was closed to the public after the September 11 attacks. Holter Dam was one of the last two such PPL dams to be closed. In 2014, PPL sold Holter Dam and their other Montana dams to NorthWestern Corporation.|$|E
25|$|Head {{distinct}} from neck, snout very short and rounded. The nostril between three shields, and head covered with small keeled scales, among which an enlarged supraocular is sometimes present. There are 9-14 interocular scales <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> {{the head and}} 14-21 circumorbital scales. 1-3 rows of scales separate the eye from the supralabials. There are 10-12 supralabials, the fourth usually largest, and 10-13 sublabials.|$|E
25|$|Ballet {{shoes are}} soft, pliable shoes made of canvas or leather, with either {{continuous}} or two-part sole (also called split-sole), used for ballet dancing. The sole is typically made of leather, with thicker material under {{the ball and}} heel of the foot, and thinner and thus more flexible material under the arch so that the foot can be easily pointed. They are typically secured by elastics <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the foot.|$|E
50|$|Weed-wiping {{may also}} be used, where a wick wetted with {{herbicide}} is suspended from a boom and dragged or rolled <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> taller weed plants. This allows treatment of taller grassland weeds by direct contact without affecting related but desirable shorter plants in the grassland sward beneath. The method has the benefit of avoiding spray drift. In Wales, a scheme offering free weed-wiper hire was launched in 2015 {{in an effort to}} reduce the levels of MCPA in water courses.|$|R
2500|$|Media organisations {{carried out}} {{protests against the}} shootings. Libération, Le Monde, Le Figaro, and other French media outlets used black banners {{carrying}} the slogan [...] "Je suis Charlie" [...] <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> their websites. <b>The</b> front page of Libérations printed version was a different black banner that stated, [...] "" [...] ("We are all Charlie"), while Paris Normandie renamed itself Charlie Normandie for the day. The French and UK versions of Google displayed a black ribbon of mourning {{on the day of}} the attack.|$|R
50|$|The Standby screen {{displays}} the network type, signal strength, Location setting, and battery condition <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top.</b> <b>The</b> background <b>of</b> the screen {{can be set}} to a slide show of images, a Flash animation, a video, or an image. The Standby screen can also display a translucent date/time bar of your choosing.|$|R
25|$|In 1608, Henry Hudson made {{a second}} attempt, {{trying to go}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> Russia. He made it to Novaya Zemlya but was forced to turn back. Between 1609 and 1611, Hudson, after several voyages on behalf of English merchants to explore a {{prospective}} Northern Sea Route to India, explored the region around modern New York City while looking for a western route to Asia {{under the auspices of}} the Dutch East India Company (VOC).|$|E
25|$|All {{species in}} the genus Zaprionus are easily {{identified}} by the longitudinal white stripes bordered by black stripes running <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the head and thorax. Species of the subgenus Zaprionus have 4 or 6 white stripes while the species of the subgenus Anaprionus have 5 or 7 white stripes. The general body color varies across species from yellowish to dark brown. Several species of the subgenus Zaprionus have one or more stout and sometimes composite spines on the forelegs.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{requirement}} to operate at an altitude of 24,000m (78,700ft) for 48 hours, Grob designed a twin-engined aircraft with a straight, very high aspect ratio wing of 56.5m (185ft 4½in) span. The wings featured winglets, and were mounted <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the fuselage which terminated in a T-tail configuration. The aircraft was designed to be crewed by two pilots, and could accommodate two scientists and associated mission equipment in a pressurised cabin. A galley, rest facilities and a toilet were provided.|$|E
50|$|It {{is found}} in creek beds and on {{floodplains}} in the Kimberley region of Western Australia growing in alluvium and sandy soils. It extends <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern Territory.|$|R
5000|$|Furthermore, {{male and}} female workers of B. affinis also differ {{in terms of their}} {{appearance}} and body size. Male workers are typically slightly larger than females (13 - 17.5 mm in length), and have a few off-white/pale hairs present on <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> their heads. [...] They also have black hair which sometimes streaks <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> their abdomens (which are typically yellow). [...] Finally, males can even have pale yellow hair on their abdomens, as opposed to the normal shade of yellow observed in females and queens.|$|R
