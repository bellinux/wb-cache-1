40|$|We {{introduce}} Rokhlin {{properties for}} certain discrete group <b>actions</b> <b>on</b> C^*-correspondences {{as well as}} on Hilbert bimodules and analyze them. It turns out that the group <b>actions</b> <b>on</b> any C^*-correspondence E with Rokhlin property induces group <b>actions</b> <b>on</b> the associated C^*-algebra O_E with Rokhlin property and the group <b>actions</b> <b>on</b> any Hilbert bimodule with Rokhlin property induces group <b>actions</b> <b>on</b> the linking algebra with Rokhlin property. Permanence properties of several notions such as nuclear dimension and D-absorbing property with respect to crossed product of Hilbert C^*-modules with groups, where group actions have Rokhlin property, are studied. We also investigate a notion of outerness for Hilbert bimodules. Comment: 25 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1401. 6852 by other author...|$|R

In {{this article we}} develop a conceptual approach to the classification of cohomogeneity one <b>actions</b> <b>on</b> Riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type in terms of orbit equivalence. As a consequence, we find many new examples of cohomogeneity one <b>actions</b> <b>on</b> Riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type. We apply our conceptual approach to derive explicit classifications of cohomogeneity one <b>actions</b> <b>on</b> some symmetric spaces. Comment: 28 page...|$|R

Although they have been used with less frequency recently due to the decrease of Kabaraikin Suits and increase of the use of other ADR procedures, they have a good reputation among their users and have successfully eased the burden on judges of district courts regardless of budget constraint.
