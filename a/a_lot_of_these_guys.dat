By no means do I mean it disrespectfully toward any other fighters because I think they do a great job. But hopefully Zuffa and the UFC will start paying them a little better."

5000|$|Tom Verducci, {{longtime}} Sports Illustrated baseball writer, reminisced about Carter {{following his}} death, [...] "I cannot conjure a single image of Gary Carter with {{anything but a}} smile on his face. I have no recollection of a gloomy Carter, not even as his knees began to announce a slow surrender ... Carter played every day with the joy {{as if it were the}} opening day of Little League." [...] "Gary actually took a lot of grief from his teammates for being a straight arrow. It wasn't the cool thing to do but on the same token, I think he actually served as a role model for <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> as they aged. He was the ballast of that team. They did have a lot of fun, there's no question about that, but they were also one of the fiercest, most competitive teams I've ever seen and obviously their comebacks from the '86 postseason defines that team. Carter was a huge part of that." ...|$|E
5000|$|Writer Matt Bondurant {{wrote the}} {{historical}} novel The Wettest County in the World (2008), {{based on the}} Prohibition-era bootlegging activities of his grandfather Jack Bondurant and his grand-uncles Forrest and Howard. Producers Douglas Wick and Lucy Fisher optioned the book in 2008 {{and sent it to}} director John Hillcoat. [...] Hillcoat later commented, [...] "Bootlegging sort of drew Bondurants into this crazy kind of world of corruption and lawlessness ironically, but then mostly they survived, they got through it all and actually went on to have businesses and children. And traditionally the gangster film teaches us that we've got to pay for our sins. Usually the gangster is shot down in a blaze of glory and doesn't get up again."Hillcoat and screenwriter Nick Cave, who had worked together on the Western film The Proposition (2005), were attracted to the story by the success of the Bondurants. Hillcoat also said, [...] "we also loved the idea that it sort of touched on the whole immortality that <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> start to feel when they do survive so many strange experiences." ...|$|E

5000|$|The race {{restarted}} with 20 laps to go. Johnson was {{no match}} for Kenseth on old tires who passed him with ease for the lead. However, Joey Logano was hot on his tail in the closing laps. Kenseth blocked Logano's advance going into turn 3 with six laps to go. Coming to five to go, Kenseth ran into lap traffic and it allowed Logano to close in and Kenseth went up the track to block him again. Rounding turn 1, Logano turned him and send him spinning. This brought out the seventh caution of the race with five to go. After the race, Logano said that the incident was [...] "good hard racing. He raced me hard, so I raced him hard back. The fact that we’re the only team that can relax now is going to pay big dividends going into Martinsville. To make <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> nervous going into Talladega is part of the strategy." [...] Kenseth spoke on the incident saying that it's difficult [...] "to drive a car with the rear tires off the ground. I was moving around the best I could, Joey (Logano) was a lot tighter, a lot faster on the short run, but we were so much better on the long run. I could still kind of get up to the top and get a run and get around him. We caught those two lapped cars, ‘Crazy’ (spotter) told me I was clear and I was, I {{pulled up in front of}} him and he just lifted my tires off the ground and he wrecked us." ...|$|E
