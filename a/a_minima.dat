The most widely distributed species, A.horrida, occurs both in tropical dry forest and in more humid forest types, {{but there is a}} gap in its distribution which coincides with the wettest forests of the upper Amazon Basin. Two other species, <b>A.</b> <b>minima</b> and A.eggersii, are also found in drier environments; A.eggersii is found in areas receiving as little as [...] of precipitation annually. The remaining species are found in montane forests at high elevations or in wet—often very wet—lowland forests, including areas receiving as much as [...] of annual precipitation.|$|E

5000|$|Aiphanes {{species have}} a long history of human use. The remains of {{carbonised}} seeds thought to belong to A. horrida have been found in archaeological sites in Colombia dating back to about 2800 BP; seeds of this species are still consumed and are traded in local markets. Aiphanes horrida is also widely planted as an ornamental, as is <b>A.</b> <b>minima.</b> [...] The fruit or seeds of A. deltoidea, [...] A. eggersii, A. linearis and <b>A.</b> <b>minima</b> are all consumed locally. The palm heart of A. macroloba is consumed by the Coaiquer people of northwestern South America. Aiphanol, a compound isolated from A. horrida, has shown significant inhibitory activity against cyclooxygenases; inhibition of these enzymes can provide relief from the symptoms of inflammation and pain.|$|E

They recognised that if Macroanthera was reduced to three species (A. horrida, A. eggersii and <b>A.</b> <b>minima)</b> it could form a viable grouping, but that this would leave Brachyanthera overly heterogeneous.

50|$|Two {{species are}} characterised by an acaulescent growth habit—A. acaulis and A. spicata.

Aiphanes grandis and <b>A.</b> <b>minima</b> are single-stemmed palms which grow {{to be more}} than 10 m tall, while the remainder are multi-stemmed understorey species. Multi-stemmed palms range from plants with a single main stem and a few basal suckers to caespitose clumps of 20 densely packed stems. A variety of growth forms can exist within a single species and this appears to be influenced by habitat and environmental conditions.|$|E
