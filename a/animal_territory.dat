50|$|An <b>animal</b> chooses its <b>territory</b> by {{deciding}} {{what part of}} its home range it will defend. In selecting a territory, the size and quality play crucial roles in determining an <b>animal's</b> habitat. <b>Territory</b> size generally tends to be no larger than the organism requires to survive, because defending a larger territory incurs greater energy, time and risk of injury costs. For some <b>animals,</b> the <b>territory</b> size {{is not the most}} important aspect of territoriality, but rather the quality of the defended territory.|$|R

50|$|A {{home range}} {{is the area}} in which an animal lives and moves on a {{periodic}} basis. It is related to the concept of an <b>animal's</b> <b>territory</b> which is the area that is actively defended. The concept of a home range was introduced by W. H. Burt in 1943. He drew maps showing where the animal had been observed at different times. An associated concept is the utilization distribution which examines where the animal is likely to be at any given time. Data for mapping a home range used to be gathered by careful observation, but nowadays, the animal is fitted with a transmission collar or similar GPS device.|$|R

Burdon {{is often}} listed as The Party Boys' seventh vocalist, however a Burdon fansite {{suggests}} that they were his backing group on the Australian leg of his tour promoting the 1988 solo album, I Used to Be an Animal. The line-up for this version was Burdon, Christie, Mal Eastick on guitar (Stars), Mal Logan on keyboards (Healing Force, Renée Geyer Band) and Warren McLean on drums (Machinations, I'm Talking). Garry Raffaele of The Canberra Times caught their July gig in Queanbeyan, [...] "a two-hour concert which certainly rocked along — loud, aggressive, brash, with the odd nod {{in the direction of}} John Lee Hooker, Jerry Lee Lewis, Richie Valens, Memphis Slim".

Done with a direct, outgoing joy that almost carried off the night. But not quite. Even rock and roll; the wild child of music, needs the hills and valleys, the peaks and troughs".|$|E
40|$|In {{territorial}} contests, {{not only}} acoustic or other signals, {{but also the}} movements of a territorial intruder are likely to influence the response of a resident. 2. We tested this movement hypothesis by simulating moving vs. stationary intruders into the territories of winter wrens Troglodytes troglodytes, using the same non-interactive song playbacks in both treatments. 3. Male winter wrens showed a different long-term singing reaction {{in response to a}} moving than to a stationary intruder. 4. One day after experiencing an intruder that was switching between three locations, residents started to sing earlier before sunrise, and they sang more and longer songs at dawn than before the intrusion. 5. Residents receiving the same playback from one location only reacted by starting to sing later relative to sunrise, and by singing fewer and shorter songs than before the intrusion. 6. We could not discriminate between the treatments when examining the short-term singing reactions during and immediately after the playbacks. However, our results clearly demonstrate an effect of the spatial behaviour of territorial intruders on the long-term territory defence of residents at dawn, about 24 h after an intrusion. 7. We argue that spatial behaviour of territorial intruders should {{be an integral part of}} the study of <b>animal</b> <b>territory</b> defence behaviour. Investigating long-term changes in territory defence at dawn is a sensitive tool for discriminating between different types of intruders...|$|E
40|$|Survival {{estimation}} {{forms the}} basis of much ecological research, and usually requires data on marked animals. In population studies of territorial animals, however, data are often collected on <b>animal</b> <b>territory</b> occupancy without identification of individuals. Previously, these data {{could not be used}} to estimate demographic parameters such as survival. 2. We developed a hierarchical site-occupancy model for estimating survival from territory occupancy data without individual identification. We defined survival as the probability that an individual occupying a territory survives until the next reproductive period and settles in the same territory again. To evaluate our model, we used simulated data as well as real data from a long-term study on nightingales Luscinia megarhynchos, from which mark-recapture data and territory occupancy data were available. 3. When applied to simulated data sets on territory occupancy, with parameter settings that are typical for different monitoring programmes (i. e. 10 years duration, three or eight visits per season, and 55 or 200 territories surveyed), our model yielded unbiased estimates of survival if the probability of detecting an occupied territory during a single visit was p = 0 center dot 5 or p = 0 center dot 7. 4. When applied to the data on nightingale territory occupancy, estimates of survival from our model were very similar to the estimates obtained from a traditional mark-recapture model (Cormack-Jolly-Seber model) applied to the ringing data from the same nightingale population. 5. Synthesis and applications. Data collection for mark-recapture analysis is usually invasive and labour intensive, and suitable data are rarely available from large-scale monitoring programmes covering entire regions or countries. Applying our model to territory occupancy data from such monitoring programmes could make large amounts of data available for research on animal demography...|$|E

Our approach applies not only to fixed dimension problems, but also to variable dimension problems, in which the number of cells in the tessellation is unknown. We illustrate our methods with two real examples. The first relates to reconstructing <b>animal</b> <b>territories,</b> represented by the individual cells of a tessellation, from observation of an inhomogeneous Poisson point process.

40|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>territories</b> {{that differ}} in the {{availability}} of food resources will require (all other things being equal) different levels of effort for successful reproduction. As a consequence, breeding performance may become most strongly dependent on factors that affect individual foraging where resources are poor. We investigated potential links between foraging behaviour, reproductive performance and morphology in a goshawk Accipiter gentilis population, which experienced markedly different resource levels in two {{different parts of the}} study area (rabbit-rich vs. rabbit-poor areas). Our analyses revealed (1) that rabbit abundance positively affected male reproductive output; (2) that age, size and rabbit abundance (during winter) positively affected different components of female reproductive output; (3) that foraging movements were inversely affected by rabbit abundance for both sexes (for females, this may mainly have reflected poor provisioning by males in the rabbit-poor area); (4) that younger breeders (both in males and females) tended to move over larger distances than older individuals (which may have reflected both a lack of hunting experience and mate searching); and (5) that male body size (wing length) showed some covariation with resource conditions (suggesting possible adaptations to hunting agile avian prey in the rabbit-poor area). Although we are unable to establish firm causal relationships with our observational data set, our results provide an example of how territory quality (here, food abundance) and individual features (here, age and morphology) may combine to shape a predator's foraging behaviour and, ultimately, its breeding performance...|$|R
