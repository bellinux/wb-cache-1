25|$|If {{it is so}} {{difficult}} to define terms such as 'psychology' with such precision, why bother? Why not just <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> all have at least a rough idea of what psychology is, and take {{the rest of the afternoon}} off? After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of some aspect of the world or our fellow people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, what difference does it make whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, or what have you? This raises the question of what definitions in general are good for.|$|E
2500|$|... "We, the undersigned, do <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{will not}} play the third match between All-England and Sussex, which is {{intended}} to be played at Brighton in July or August unless the Sussex bowlers bowl fair – this is, abstain from throwing".|$|E
2500|$|Tebbit privately said of John Major on 17 November 1994: [...] "He has the mulishness of a weak {{man with}} stupidity". When asked {{what would it}} take for him to support Major, Tebbit responded: [...] "Have an entirely new department, the sole job of which would be to deal with the Brussels {{machinery}} in every aspect. I <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> don't want to leave the EU, but we've got to manipulate it and block every single advance we don't like. No, no, no must be his weapon. Veto everything he disapproves of or that we disapprove of".|$|E
60|$|So we parted, {{it being}} <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were to start upon our journey on the {{following}} morning.|$|R
60|$|TANNER. [subsiding] It's all right, then. He's {{not going}} to act up to his principles. It's <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> all stand by Violet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you {{forgotten}} what we agreed on, Godfrey, when {{you spoke to}} me in the country? <b>We</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were to be cousins, and nothing more." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "And I {{am going}} to urge that we bring back those bills, maybe reconfigure them to center on mental health, which is {{a point where we}} can <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> need more {{resources}} to make the country healthier {{and to make sure that}} these kinds of horrific, insane, mad occurrences are stopped. And the Congress will be complicit if we fail to act."California Senator Dianne Feinstein blamed the National Rifle Association's [...] "stranglehold" [...] on gun laws for the attack and said [...] "shame on us" [...] in Congress for failing to do something about it. Pennsylvania Congressman Timothy F. Murphy, a clinical psychologist, said his bipartisan mental health overhaul would be a solution and urged Congress to pass it.|$|E
2500|$|Statements of President Chávez over a {{potential}} coup {{involvement of the}} United States are varied. Shortly before the coup attempt, Chávez dismissed possible hostility from the United States, since [...] "times had changed." [...] After the coup, however, Chávez asserted numerous times that United States government officials knew about plans for a coup, approved of them, and assumed they would be successful, alleging that [...] "two military officers from the United States" [...] {{were present in the}} headquarters of coup plotters. Chávez would also state after the coup that there was [...] "little evidence" [...] that the United States orchestrated the plan. Rear Admiral Carlos Molina, a central leader of the coup, later said that [...] "We felt we were acting with US support... we <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can’t permit a communist government here. The US has not let us down yet." [...] However, the United States repeatedly informed the Venezuelan opposition {{that they would not be}} supported if there were a coup and President George W. Bush denied the United States' involvement.|$|E
6000|$|... "He won't be {{back for}} some time, and I expect he'll <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> don't need help. I think you had better stick to your Hamburg friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Patsy, [...] "it is all arranged, and I'm the captain. And is it <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> won't lisp {{a word to}} Mr. Watson or Louise?" ...|$|R
60|$|Comparing {{views in}} the train, <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had lost the game by two points to one; and George, who was evidently disappointed, threw the book out of window.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Secretary of State for Defence has <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{will remain}} in the European Defence Agency for a period of two years, then we will review the status of our membership".|$|R
6000|$|... "I fear {{you were}} not born a diplomat, sir," [...] says Patty. [...] "You <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are beautiful, yet to hear that {{one of us is}} more so is small consolation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, what sad words!" [...] said Dorothea, with a {{dangerous}} tendency to sob. Then trying to smile, she added, [...] "We used to <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were alike in speaking too strongly." ...|$|E
60|$|Three invalids.—Sufferings of George and Harris.—A {{victim to}} one hundred and seven fatal maladies.—Useful prescriptions.—Cure for liver {{complaint}} in children.—We <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are overworked, and need rest.—A week on the rolling deep?—George suggests the River.—Montmorency lodges an objection.—Original motion carried by majority of three to one.|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{will our}} having an office-boy {{increase}} our circulation?" [...] demanded Peter Hope. [...] "Besides, it was <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{could do without}} one for the first year. Why suggest more expense?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> cannot surrender?" [...] and Mark {{asked the}} {{question}} in an angry tone, as if expecting she would refuse to view {{the situation in the}} same light he did.|$|R
6000|$|... “You know <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{must make}} the best of everything,” Will said. “If we work as we are doing we can’t but please our overseers, and shall save {{ourselves}} from blows.” ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{laid her}} hand lightly on his arm. 'Whether he did or not,' {{she said with}} an earnestness that was almost an entreaty, 'of course, you MUST <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{every one of us}} have some such experience--that kind of visitor, once at least, in a lifetime.' 'Ah, but,' began Lawford, turning forlornly away, 'you didn't see, you can't have realized--the change.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have been}} talking it over, and all <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> must wait until he can be moved. Inconstant as Charles is, {{there can be no}} fear of a change in his {{friendly}} intentions now. He has already closed all the gates of Paris save two, and everyone who goes in or out is closely questioned, and has to show his papers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Especially as we know,' said Fanny, 'that there {{certainly}} is a tone in the place to which you have been so true, which does belong to it, and which does make it different from other aspects of Society. So kiss me once again, Amy dear, and we will <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> may both be right, and {{that you are a}} tranquil, domestic, home-loving, good girl.' ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> knew {{something}} in that way, but inquired how I {{should have gone to}} work in getting up the imposts on the lintels of even the little palace at Carnac.|$|R
5000|$|For example, one {{reported}} note by Provenzano read [...] "I met 512151522 191212154 and <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{will see}} each other after the holidays..." [...] This name was decoded as [...] "Binnu Riina".|$|R
60|$|Harris said {{he thought}} it was a very fine maze, so far as he was a judge; and <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> would try to get George to go into it, on our way back.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{ought to}} let {{sentiment}} interfere with our judgment in this matter. The question is simply: How are our pockets {{going to be}} affected? I came here with some misgivings, but {{the attitude of the}} chairman has been such as to remove them; and I shall support the proposition." [...] The secretary thought: 'That's all right--only, he said it rather queerly--rather queerly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are all against that," [...] Field said positively. [...] "We {{have talked}} {{it over and}} <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall {{never be able to}} fix on one. Suppose our votes were divided between four and five I don't think we should feel more {{comfortable}} afterwards. We would rather put all the names in a hat and draw one out, just leaving it to chance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We do {{not want}} to go there at all, but my husband will go to wind up his affairs, and sell his house there. We have been talking it over, and <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should never like {{to go back to the}} estate again. Even if things did quiet down the {{memories}} are too terrible; and, besides, having once broken out, the blacks might do so again at any time." ...|$|E
5000|$|Chapter 7. [...] "That a synod be held twice a year." [...] In view {{of various}} obstacles, however, it was {{unanimously}} <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should meet {{once a year}} on the first of August at Clofeshoch.|$|R
6000|$|... "My son Alfred and I," [...] he said, [...] "talked it {{over last}} night and <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can run the car ourselves, or make a shot at it anyway. After all, it's war time." ...|$|R
60|$|It was <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{had fallen}} into Logan's Pond from a raft: my suggestion. Well, said Tom, the Petrel hadn't proved much better than a raft, after all. I {{was in no mood}} to defend her.|$|R
6000|$|Though {{lying there}} alone, the poor creetur was as well {{taken care of}} as could be hoped, and would have been quite {{unconscious}} of any one's sitting by him then. I got the Major to say that we were not going away at present and that I would come back to-morrow and watch a bit by the bedside. But I got him to add--and I shook my head hard to make it stronger--"We <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> never saw this face before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't wonder," [...] {{answered}} Margaret, [...] "that {{they are}} getting tired; they have found the pole, {{and they want to}} come home. That is natural enough. But, for my part, I am very glad we can't run up there. Even if we had another Dipsey I should decidedly oppose it. I might <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should go to Cape Tariff, but I would not agree to anything more. You may discover poles if you want to, but you must do it by proxy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was much}} {{impressed}} {{by what you}} said in your sermon to-day as to the need of insisting upon authority in religious matters," [...] he declared, [...] "and I quite <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should have a chapel of some size at the settlement house for that reason. Those people need spiritual control. It's what the age needs. And when I think {{of some of the}} sermons printed in the newspapers to-day, and which are served up as Christianity, there is only one term to apply to them--they are criminally incendiary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] cried Molly. [...] "You're wrong. You're quite wrong. When you saw us, <b>we</b> {{were just}} <b>agreeing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{should be very}} good friends. That was all. I broke off the {{engagement}} before that. I--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well you see, Harry, <b>we</b> have <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{neither of}} us are in a {{position}} rightly to estimate the value of this £10,000 at present. Now Agnes, on the contrary, {{is in a position to}} appreciate it keenly." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>That</b> {{afternoon}} <b>we</b> held {{a conference}} {{at which it}} was <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should begin our return journey to Beza Town at once, as {{the place where we}} were camped was very malarious and there was always a risk of the Pongo paying us another visit.|$|R
