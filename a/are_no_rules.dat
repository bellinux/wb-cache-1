5|$|A big celebration {{is held by}} the city's {{population}} as the Simpsons are officially evicted from Springfield. When the family drives out {{into the middle of}} nowhere at night with no place to stay, they come across a man who takes them to a county called The Outlands, which is a dirty, run-down place where there <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>rules</b> and regulations. The Simpsons settle in The Outlands and meet Julian Assange—their unfriendly next-door neighbor who operates the WikiLeaks Headquarters there.|$|E

25|$|The {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to capture the opponent's emperor and prince (or princes). When the last of these is captured, the game ends. There <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>rules</b> for check or checkmate; however, in practice a player resigns when checkmated.|$|E

25|$|Workington in Cumbria holds three Uppies and Downies matches {{over the}} Easter period. There <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>rules,</b> except those {{suggested}} by cunning and skill, while brute force {{is of the}} greatest importance. The goals are about a mile apart. The Uppies attempt to hail the ball {{at the gates of}} Workington Hall while the Downies hail at the capstan at the harbour side.|$|E
25|$|UFC 1 – Although the {{advertising}} said There <b>Are</b> <b>No</b> <b>Rules,</b> {{there were in}} fact some rules: no biting, no eye-gouging and no groin attacks. Fights ended only {{in the event of}} a knockout, submission or the corner throwing in the towel. Despite this, the first match in UFC 1 was won by referee stoppage, even though it was not officially recognized as such at the time.|$|E
25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>rules</b> for {{how many}} species should make a genus, a family, or any other higher taxon (that is, a taxon in a {{category}} above the species level). It should be a natural group (that is, non-artificial, non-polyphyletic), as judged by a biologist, using all the information available to them. Equally ranked higher taxa in different phyla are not necessarily equivalent (e.g., it is incorrect to assume that families of insects are in some way evolutionarily comparable to families of mollusks). For animals, at least the phylum rank is usually associated with a certain body plan, which is also, however, an arbitrary criterion.|$|E
50|$|There can be {{informal}} agreements or alliances {{between the}} players, but there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>rule</b> {{to prevent any}} betrayal.|$|R

500|$|Lawson {{has adopted}} a casual {{approach}} to cooking, stating, [...] "I think cooking should be about fun and family. ... I think part of my appeal is that my approach to cooking is really relaxed and not rigid. There <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>rules</b> in my kitchen." [...] One editor, highlighting the technical simplicity of Lawson's recipes, noted that [...] "her dishes require none of the elaborate preparation called for by most TV chefs".|$|E
500|$|Project 86's {{music is}} {{characterized}} by heavy rock and Schwab's [...] "loud, eerie, and atmospheric" [...] vocal style. Their sound has been likened to rock groups Helmet, Rage Against the Machine, and Tool. The moniker [...] "intense" [...] has frequently {{been used as a}} description. Rick Anderson of Allmusic called the music [...] "dense and crunchy", while Albuquerque Journal writer Ron Gonzales declared it a [...] "blisteringly heavy sound." [...] Commenting on their musical style, Schwab said, [...] "Our goal as a band has been to never make the same record twice. The only rule is that there <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>rules.</b> If there is a rule, it's that we try not to over-think things, that the music that comes out is honest and real, spontaneous and from our heart." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{those of}} most sports, {{baseball}} playing fields can vary significantly {{in size and}} shape. While {{the dimensions of the}} infield are specifically regulated, the only constraint on outfield size and shape for professional teams following the rules of Major League and Minor League Baseball is that fields built or remodeled since June 1, 1958, must have a minimum distance of [...] from home plate to the fences in left and right field and [...] to center. Major league teams often skirt even this rule. For example, at Minute Maid Park, which became the home of the Houston Astros in 2000, the Crawford Boxes in left field are only [...] from home plate. There <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>rules</b> at all that address the height of fences or other structures {{at the edge of the}} outfield. The most famously idiosyncratic outfield boundary is the left-field wall at Boston's Fenway Park, in use since 1912: the Green Monster is [...] from home plate down the line and [...] tall.|$|E

500|$|... c. [...] In 1890 Prus wrote: [...] "When I was {{starting}} {{out as a}} writer, I wrote in part instinctively, in part by inadvertent imitation. [...] My productions were a collection of haphazard observations, put together no doubt {{against the backdrop of}} what I had read. [...] Every beginning author does the same. [...] To be sure, this kind of work was to me a great mortification. [...] Then I began asking older authors, and they told me that 'there <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>rules,</b> nor can there be any, for the art of novel-writing.' [...] Then , brought to desperation, I set about trying to resolve for myself the question: [...] 'Can literary art be reduced to general rules?' [...] After several years of observing and thinking, the matter began to get clearer for me, and as early as August 1886 I set down my first notes [...] and, God willing, I hope to publish a scientific theory of literary art. [...] I expect that it will contain some fairly new things." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the outing of newly deceased multimillionaire Malcolm Forbes by the lesbian and gay news magazine, OutWeek, Petrelis said of the tactic, [...] "Outing is a very complicated issue. There <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>rules</b> for outing. Politicians give up a lot of their privacy. Their lives are lived in a fishbowl." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to capture the opponent's king(s) and prince(s). [...] When the last of these is captured, the game ends. There <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>rules</b> for check or checkmate; however, in practice a player resigns when checkmated. Unlike standard shogi, pieces may not be dropped back into play after being captured.|$|E
25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>rule</b> {{governing}} {{the strength of}} the 'ava. If the root is plentiful, the drink is naturally made several degrees stronger than if it is in short supply.|$|R

2500|$|Stamps can be {{displayed}} {{according to the}} collector's wishes, by country, topic, or even by size, which can create a display pleasing to the eye. There <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>rules</b> and it is entirely a matter for the individual collector to decide. [...] Albums can be commercially purchased, downloaded or created by the collector. [...] In the latter cases using acid free paper provides better long-term stamp protection.|$|E
2500|$|Students enroll {{through a}} lottery system {{and can be}} entered into this lottery {{as early as the}} sixth grade. [...] The only way to get into DSA is through the school lottery. Students living near the school do not {{automatically}} gain enrollment, although many have made it into the school through the official lottery. Most students are admitted in 6th grade, though there <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>rules</b> prohibiting entrance after that age, as there is some turnover in higher grades. [...] The primary year for turnover is 9th grade, when many students transfer to other area high schools.|$|E
2500|$|The game {{consists}} of each panellist in turn announcing a landmark or street, most often a tube {{station on the}} London Underground system. The apparent aim {{is to be the}} first to announce [...] "Mornington Crescent", a station on the Northern line. Interspersed with the turns is humorous discussion amongst the panellists and host regarding the rules and legality of each move, as well as the strategy the panellists are using. Despite appearances, however, there <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>rules</b> to the game, and both the naming of stations and the specification of [...] "rules" [...] are based on stream-of-consciousness association and improvisation. Thus the game is intentionally incomprehensible.|$|E
50|$|While {{filling a}} bat with cork makes it lighter, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>rule</b> that {{prevents}} a player from using a lighter, uncorked bat. However, lighter wood bats are shorter than heavier bats.|$|R

2500|$|On October 8, 2013, Gambino {{released}} a teaser video for the album, which he announced as being titled Because the Internet {{and that it}} would be released in December 2013. Gambino told MTV that singer Beck gave him the idea for the album title. He explained the title, saying: [...] "Because the internet I'm here, because of the internet we're all here. It's the language of earth. Everyone keeps saying by this or that year, Mandarin or Spanish will be the most dominant language, but the internet is already a language we are all connected to; even my dad can understand the meme format. But the thing is, there <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>rules,</b> which is also the awesome thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Massimo Pigliucci on the Rationally Thinking podcast, Baggott stated that science is a human endeavor with a [...] "fuzziness around the edges". He {{went on to say}} that there <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>rules</b> and, when training to be a scientist, no one gives you an instruction book on how to do science. [...] "We kinda make it up as we go along... and it is perfectly reasonable for the scientific community to want to change those rules." [...] Science writer Philip Ball, in a review of Farewell in The Guardian, stated that Baggott was right [...] "although his target is as much the way this science is marketed as what it contains." [...] Ball cautioned Baggott about criticising scientists that speculate because [...] "conjecture injects vitality into science." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rather than {{intending}} to communicate a single or concrete meaning with his work, Pinsky anticipated that his poetry would change {{depending on the}} particular subjectivity of each reader. Embracing the idea that people's individuality would fill out the poem, he has said, [...] "The poetry I love is written with someone’s voice and I believe its proper culmination is to be read with someone’s voice. And the human voice in that sense is not electronically reproduced or amplified; it’s the actual living breath inside a body—not necessarily the second life of reception—not necessarily the expert’s body or the artist’s body. Whoever reads the poem aloud becomes the proper medium for the poem." [...] Pinsky observes 'the kind of poetry I write emphasizes the physical qualities of the words' for poetry to Pinsky, is a vocal art, not necessarily performative,but reading to one self or recalling some lines by memory. Pinsky comments 'all language is necessarily abstract ' [...] No aspect of a poem, he observes, is more singular, more unique, than its rhythm, for there <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>rules.</b>|$|E
