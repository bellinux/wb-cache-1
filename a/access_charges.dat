25|$|Latest {{engineering}} studies of 'the Gap' {{have produced a}} design for a single-track link (difficult to justify the additional cost for double-track) - previously proposing to utilize two, ex-Network Rail, single-track bridges (removed {{as part of the}} Reading Station upgrade), now to be utilized to bridge the Preci-Spark Car Park and Railway Terrace. The latest design proposes to re-instate the bridge over the Midland Main Line utilizing a new-build single span bridge, complying with electrification clearances for the recently announced electrification project. This will cost significantly more than the original proposal, but has the benefits of reduced future maintenance and <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> for the previously proposed central pillar. The additional cost is somewhat offset by the use of the 'Reading Bridges' at the locations mentioned.

50|$|One {{consequence}} of the breakup was that local residential service rates, which were formerly subsidized by long distance revenues, began to rise faster than the rate of inflation. Long-distance rates, meanwhile, fell both due {{to the end of}} this subsidy and increased competition. The FCC established a system of <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> where long distance networks paid the more expensive local networks both to originate and terminate a call. In this way, the implicit subsidies of the Bell System became explicit post-divestiture. These <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> became a source of strong controversy as one company after another sought to arbitrage the network and avoid these fees. In 2002 the FCC declared that Internet service providers would be treated as if they were local and would not have to pay these <b>access</b> <b>charges.</b> This led to VoIP service providers arguing {{that they did not have}} to pay <b>access</b> <b>charges,</b> resulting in significant savings for VoIP calls. The FCC was split on this issue for some time; VoIP services that utilized IP but in every other way looked like a normal phone call generally had to pay <b>access</b> <b>charges,</b> while VoIP services that looked more like applications on the Internet and did not interconnect with the public telephone network did not have to pay <b>access</b> <b>charges.</b> However, an FCC order issued in December 2011 declared that all VoIP services would have to pay the charges for nine years, at which point all <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> would then be phased out.|$|E

40|$|Market {{structure}} and the incentive to invest in telecommunication infrastructure This paper addresses {{the question of how}} the competitive situation in a downstream market, the services, influences the innovative activity in an upstream market, the network infrastructure. To attend to the two-level-structure of the market presented above, the structure of the model follows models from the patent licensing literature. To adapt to the telecommunication sector this paper considers an integrated network provider that developed a new technology which reduces the production costs of the service providers. To permit the service providers to use the technology he can <b>charge</b> an <b>access</b> fee. It can be shown that the network provider’s profit increases with the number of competitors given the <b>access</b> <b>charge</b> is sufficiently high. The effect persists even if the <b>access</b> <b>charge</b> is set lower than the network supplier would set it. Hence it exists a range of the <b>access</b> <b>charge</b> where increasing competition in the service market yields more innovative investment in the network infrastructure...|$|R
