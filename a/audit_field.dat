40|$|PurposeThis study aims {{to examine}} the {{association}} between auditor {{and chief financial officer}} (CFO) gender and earnings quality, utilising data from Sweden. This study also {{aims to examine}} whether interactions between auditor and CFO, which may affect a firm’s earnings quality, are associated with their gender. These aims are inspired by the notion that gender differences will be overruled by the rewards and socialisation into the occupational roles as suggested by the structural approach to gender. Design/methodology/approachThis study uses a multivariate regression model to test its hypotheses. The sample consists of 976 firm-year observations covering the period 2008 to 2013. FindingsThe results show that gender of the auditor and CFO is not associated with earnings quality, and the interactions between auditors and CFOs, which may affect earnings quality, are not associated with their gender. Consequently, the results give tentative support for the structural approach in gender studies in the accounting and <b>auditing</b> <b>field.</b> Research limitations/implicationsThis study indicates that future research in gender studies should consider the structural approach based on the argument of gender similarities. This approach contends that work-related behaviour of women will more resemble men, and this is caused by the socialisation process into the occupational role and the structure where they work (e. g. organisational and professional culture, work conditions, a compensation scheme, national culture, etc.) instead of gender. Originality/valueThis study contributes to the understanding whether gender – auditor and CFO gender – is associated with firms’ earnings quality and standing whether the interactions between auditor and CFO are associated with their gender, something that, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, has not been tested previously.

40|$|Business Risk Audit (BRA) methodologies {{have been}} {{promoted}} {{by a number}} of the large audit firms in response, they claim, to the challenges of the information age and corporate clients' needs for assurance. This paper subjects their claim to critical scrutiny, drawing on the perspectives of neo-institutional theories of legitimacy, the sociology of professional knowledge and the sociology of science and technology. To bring into play new Business Risk Audit methodologies a number of the larger firms have sought, through their auditing practice, to renegotiate the bases of their professional identity and status within audit firms and to widen their jurisdictional claims over other areas of expertise. These moves have been accompanied by the legitimation and embedding of Business Risk Audit in revised constructions of the market for audit, in abstract academic knowledges, reforms of professional education, and professional regulations. In providing a constructivist account of Business Risk Audit technologies, we argue for a theory of audit change that recognises (i) the centrality of legitimation processes and (ii) the co-construction of audit technology and the <b>audit</b> <b>field.</b> (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|The {{results of}} the survey {{revealed}} that auditors were typically satisfied with how they plan, execute, and accomplish tasks. Auditors usually followed standard procedures for accomplishing tasks. However, the <b>audit</b> <b>field</b> assignment was executed {{on the basis of}} task units. Because the knowledge and skills of auditing are complex, audit quality and performance rely on the specialization and audit environment. The auditing process usually concludes with a report, which is a compilation of reports from each member of the field task unit. Thus, teamwork affects the quality of audit reporting and requires that team leaders guide every member. Leaders should recognize that developing cooperative relationships among team members promotes team effectiveness. Therefore, teamwork has been proven to be a significant factor affecting the quality of an audit report. By contrast, an effective audit recommendation should be based on evidence that practically resolves issues in accordance with regulations. When auditors lack on-the-job training, they are incapable of issuing a fair judgment and thus cannot deliver a report, which would otherwise present opinions on how to effectively use a budget. Performance management can be improved by developing visionary thinking and providing constructive recommendations in an audit report. An audit report can provide information and useful references for further improving the performance of executive branches, thus preventing redundant “mosquito” museums, harbors, and facilities from being built.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{attempts}} at jurisdictional expansion in the <b>audit</b> <b>field.</b> Specifically, the authors critically analyse the professional implications of "new audit spaces", that is, novel auditing and assurance services that have emerged at intersections between audit and other fields such as the environment, the public sector, sport and education. The purpose is two-fold. First, to better understand the dynamics of new audit spaces, and second, to highlight the major challenges and adaptations prompted by these dynamics. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on Bourdieu’s theory of practice, the authors highlight and problematise four issues central to the construction of new audit spaces: independence; reporting; professional accreditation; and the nature of the audit role. Findings - The audit profession has experienced mixed success in seeking to annex new audit spaces; in some instances, practices initially located at the margins of auditing have moved towards its centre, while elsewhere projects have been abandoned, colonised by others or remain in flux. In these ventures, the accounting profession is brought into competition with other bodies of expertise and modes of practice. In new audit spaces, core elements of auditing, as conventionally conceived, are transmogrified as they travel. Originality/value - This analysis calls into question some of the "sacred cows" of auditing and challenges the transferability of the capitals and habitus of the accounting profession in other domains.

In particular, the study comes to evaluate the audit quality attributes and the client satisfaction with audit services in various sectors in Jordan. In addition, the study outlines the possible procedures necessary to enhance the quality of audit services. Furthermore, the study tests the relationship between audit quality attributes and client satisfaction. Based on 48 useable questionnaires, clients see that audit firms have the necessary technical competence, experience and expertise to conduct of <b>audit</b> <b>field</b> work effectively. Thus, findings indicate that clients are satisfied with audit services in Jordan to a considerable extent. A significant, positive relationship has been found between “field work conduct and technical competence ” factor and client satisfaction.

A consensus in the perception of clients from different sectors toward the evaluation of audit quality attributes and satisfaction with audit services has been found. The results indicate that more emphasis should be given to some audit quality attributes (i. e. responsiveness, independence and executive involvement) to enhance the overall satisfaction of clients with audit service in Jordan. In addition, the study findings revealed that providing better training for auditors and compliance with corporate governance code for auditing are important procedures to improve audit quality in Jordan...|$|E
40|$|An {{inherent}} {{aspect of}} an audit {{is the level}} of task complexity that junior auditors (staff and senior level associates) endure on a daily basis. This complexity directly impacts an auditor’s ability to form an appropriate problem representation, which in turn impacts judgment performance. One of the key components of this process is having sufficient knowledge for purposes of problem representation; without it, the auditor’s problem representation and ultimately judgment performance are negatively impacted. Conversely, audit teams can positively influence the conciseness of problem representation and performance by way of effective task-specific knowledge transfer. Knowledge transfer in the <b>audit</b> <b>field</b> occurs during three distinct phases: when an auditor reviews prior and/or current year workpapers; when an auditor requests help; and/or during the workpaper review process. For purposes of efficiency and increasing (i. e. improving) problem representation, prior to any deleterious effects, it’s critical that the audit profession understand how to maximize the knowledge transfer as soon as possible after the auditor’s initial assignment of the task. Because auditors commonly will immediately refer to audit programs in the current year documentation in the electronic audit file to gain an understanding of the task, maximizing the knowledge transfer within the electronic audit file is critical to increasing auditor judgment performance. I propose utilizing media richness theory to establish an increased media rich transfer of knowledge via the electronic audit file from the audit managers (expert) to junior auditors (novice). Procedure screens within the electronic audit file would likely be categorized as “written, formal” mediums within the media richness theory, because the source of information is impersonal. However, if audit firms can successfully transform the transfer of information within the audit files from being solely formal document screens to also incorporate personal source characteristics, they will successfully increase the information richness, which will allow for a more successful transfer of knowledge and subsequently the ability for the auditor to more effectively form a problem representation...|$|E
