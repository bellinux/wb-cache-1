5000|$|Ser/Thr {{ligation}} (STL) {{was introduced}} into protein chemical synthesis {{as an alternative}} ligation strategy. STL involves merger of a side-chain unprotected peptide segment containing a C-terminal salicylaldehyde (SAL) ester and another peptide segment with an N-terminal Ser or Thr residue. The chemoselective reaction between the peptide SAL ester and 1,2-hydroxylamine group of Ser or Thr leads {{to the formation of}} an N,O-benzylidene acetal linked intermediate, which undergoes <b>acidolysis</b> to afford a natural peptidic Xaa-Ser/Thr linkage. This method does not involve the use of unnatural amino acids, and it is simple to operate. Ser/Thr ligation provides a complementary method for protein chemical synthesis and semisynthesis.|$|E
50|$|Peptides can be cyclized on a solid support. A {{variety of}} cylization {{reagents}} {{can be used}} such as HBTU/HOBt/DIEA, PyBop/DIEA, PyClock/DIEA. Head-to-tail peptides can {{be made on the}} solid support. The deprotection of the C-terminus at some suitable point allows on-resin cyclization by amide bond formation with the deprotected N-terminus. Once cyclization has taken place, the peptide is cleaved from resin by <b>acidolysis</b> and purified. The strategy for the solid-phase synthesis of cyclic peptides in not limited to attachment through Asp, Glu or Lys side chains. Cysteine has a very reactive sulfhydryl group on its side chain. A disulfide bridge is created when a sulfur atom from one Cysteine forms a single covalent bond with another sulfur atom from a second cysteine in {{a different part of the}} protein. These bridges help to stabilize proteins, especially those secreted from cells. Some researchers use modified cysteines using S-acetomidomethyl (Acm) to block the formation of the disulfide bond but preserve the cysteine and the protein's original primary structure.|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} {{between the}} oils and the enzyme causes the fatty acids of the triglycerides to exchange positions to the -1 and -3 glycerides, thereby altering the chemical composition and physical {{properties of the}} fat. Using a 1,3-specific enzyme, only the fatty acids in the 1,3 positions are shifted around, and the 2-position is untouched. Unsaturated fatty acids in the 2-position are more often found naturally in plant lipids or vegetable oil sources. Allowing the rearrangement of the saturated fatty acids {{to occur in the}} 1-position and 3-position increases the amount of bioavailable unsaturated fatty acids. Enzymes most suitable for this process are esterase; acylase; those enzymes that facilitate <b>acidolysis</b> reactions, transesterification reactions, ester synthesis or ester interchange reactions; enzymes having phospholipase or protease activity, including thermostable and thermotolerant hydrolase activity; and polynucleotides. From the two original fats, six different structures are produced during enzymatic Interesterification. A fixed bed system is the most common commercial process used for enzymatic interesterification. In a fixed bed process, the blended liquid oil and solid (hard fat) oil flow through a system consisting of an oil purification bed and an enzyme bed. The oil purification bed removes impurities from the oil blend so that the enzyme activity can be maintained at its highest performance. The enzyme bed allows for the enzymatic interesterification of the oil blend as the blend passes through the bed.|$|E

40|$|Ester interchange, alcoholysis, and <b>acidolysis</b> of polypivalolactone (PPVL) {{were studied}} by melting PPVL with {{bisphenol}} diacetates, 1, 4 -butanediol, or aromatic diacids.

Melting PPVL with 10 mol-% of bisphenol-Adiacetate {{in the presence of}} 0, 5 wt. % tetrabutylorthotitanate resulted in an incorporation of 33 % of the diacetate in the polymer chains, whereas the logarithmic viscosity number decreased by 81 %. The ester interchange was suggested to proceed by an initial cleavage of ester bonds in the polymer chain of PPVL, resulting in the formation of shorter chains, followed by a reaction between the newly formed ester end-groups and initially present hydroxyl chain ends. The <b>acidolysis</b> of PPVL with the diacids proved to be less effective; in the case of the <b>acidolysis</b> of PPVL with 10 mol-% isophthalic acid, less than 1 % of the diacid was incorporated in the polymer chains and a decrease in the logarithmic viscosity number of only 22 % was found.

The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the effect of <b>acidolysis</b> on final bleached brightness for kraft and soda-AQ (SAQ) hardwood pulps. The increase in final brightness due to <b>acidolysis</b> at 110 °C was twice as high for a eucalyptus SAQ pulp as compared to the kraft pulp. An oxygen delignified maple C-SAQ pulp (carbonate pre-treated SAQ) was acidolyzed at 120 °C and pH 2. 6 for 30 min. When 1. 60 % ClO 2 + 0. 25 % H 2 O 2 on pulp was used in DEPD final bleaching of the control sample a brightness of 91. 5 % was achieved. When only 1. 00 % ClO 2 + 0. 25 % H 2 O 2 on pulp was used for the acidolyzed sample a brightness of 92. 0 % was attained. Analyses of the maple pulp after the <b>acidolysis</b> showed no major change in lignin content, brightness, or pulp yield. The minor changes suggest that a facile reaction such as benzyl ether cleavage was responsible for the improved bleachability. Preliminary research involving a lignin model compound and commercial birch xylan showed that lignin-carbohydrate condensation products were generated under SAQ cooking conditions.

40|$|Generally biorefineries convert {{lignocellulosic}} biomass into a {{range of}} biofuels and further value added chemicals. However, conventional biorefinery processes focus mainly on the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions and therefore produce only low quality lignin, which is commonly burnt to provide process heat. To make full use of the biomass, more attention needs to be focussed on novel separation techniques, where the lignin can be isolated in a high quality suitable for further valorisation into aromatic chemicals and fuel components. In this paper, three types of lignocellulosic biomass (softwood, hardwood and herbaceous biomass) were processed by microwave-assisted <b>acidolysis,</b> to produce high quality lignin. The lignin from the softwood was isolated largely intact in the solid residue after <b>acidolysis.</b> For example, a 10 min treatment, microwave-assisted <b>acidolysis</b> produced a lignin with a purity of 93 % and yield of 82 %, superior to other conventional separation methods reported. Furthermore, the py-GC/MS analysis proved that the isolated lignin retained the original structure as native lignin in the feedstock without severe chemical modification. This is a large advantage, and the purified lignin is suitable for further chemical processing. To assess the suitability of this methodology {{as part of a}} biorefinery system, the aqueous phase, produced after <b>acidolysis</b> of the softwood, was characterised and assessed for its suitability for fermentation. The broth contained some mono- and disaccharides but mainly organic acids, oligosaccharides and furans. While this is unsuitable for S. cerevisiae and other common ethanol producing yeasts, two oleaginous yeasts with known inhibitor tolerances were selected; Cryptococcus curvatus and Metschnikowia pulcherrima. Both yeasts could grow on the broth, demonstrating suitable catabolism of the oligosaccharides and inhibitors over 7 days. In addition, both yeasts were shown to be able to produce an oil with a similar composition to palm oil.

The effects of substituent groups in the transition state involved not only electron transfer to the peroxy radical but electron delocalization in the aromatic ring.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{synthesis}} of triacylglycerols (TAGs) rich in palmitic acid (PA) at sn- 2 position from palm stearin (PS), a vegetable oil highly rich in PA (60 %, but only 12. 8 % of this is located at sn- 2 position). These PA rich TAGs were obtained by lipase-catalyzed <b>acidolysis</b> of this oil with free fatty acids (FFAs) highly rich in PA, such as commercial PA (98 % PA) and a FFA extract obtained by saponification of PS (60 % PA). PA has a melting point of 63 ºC and during the <b>acidolysis</b> reaction the substrates, highly rich in this acid, must remain liquid; therefore high temperatures or solvents must be used. An important objective of this work was to operate without solvent and at the lowest possible temperature. In this <b>acidolysis</b> reaction four factors were firstly studied: type of lipase, temperature, solvent amount {{and the intensity of}} treatment (IOT = lipase amount × reaction time/PS amount). The influence of these variables was studied in a stirred tank reactor (STR). The lipases tested were Novozym 435 from Candida antarctica (immobilized on a macroporous acrylic resin), and lipases QLC (immobilized on diatomaceous earth), and QLM (non immobilized), both from Alcaligenes sp., and the one selected was lipase QLC. According to the manufacturer the optimum temperature for this lipase is 65 - 70 ºC, which allows it to operate without solvent. The best results with lipase QLC (TAGs with 80 % PA, both total and at sn- 2 position) were obtained with commercial PA, at 65 ºC, a 3 : 1 FFA/PS molar ratio (1 : 1 w/w), without solvent and an IOT = 7 g lipase × h/g PS (for example 2. 5 g PS, 2. 5 g commercial PA, 0. 75 g lipase and 24 h). These results were the basis for establishing the operational conditions to obtain PA rich TAGs with the lipase immobilized in a packed bed reactor (PBR), operating by recirculation of the reaction mixture through the lipase bed. In this system TAGs with 75 % PA were obtained at an IOT = 8 g lipase × h/g PS. This result and the apparent kinetic constants obtained in both reactors show that the reaction rate is lower in the PBR than in the STR. Subsequently, PA enriched TAGs were separated from FFAs by two procedures: the first one at room temperature and in presence of hexane and the second one at 65 ºC and without hexane. Using the first procedure, 95 % of TAGs in the <b>acidolysis</b> reaction mixture were recovered with a purity of 99 %. Using the second one, 98 % pure TAGs were obtained with a recovery yield of 80 %. Therefore, these highly rich PA TAGs can be obtained by <b>acidolysis</b> of PS and PA rich FFAs in solvent-free media, and then these TAGs also can be purified to 98 % in absence of hexane, using only a hydroethanolic KOH solution.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{synthesis}} of triacylglycerols (TAGs) rich in palmitic acid (PA) at position 2, from palm oil stearin (POS), a vegetable oil highly rich in this acid (60 %). The developed process consists of two steps: (1) obtaining PA enriched free fatty acids (FFAs), and (2) enrichment of POS in PA by <b>acidolysis</b> of this oil with PA enriched FFAs, catalyzed by lipase Novozym 435. In step (1) two PA enriched FFA mixtures were obtained: one by saponification of POS, and a PA concentrate (75. 1 % PA) obtained by crystallization at low temperature in solvents. The latter was obtained carrying out two crystallizations in acetone at - 24 and - 20 ºC, from which PA was recovered in the solid phases with a total yield of 84 %. These PA enriched FFA mixtures were used in step (2) of <b>acidolysis</b> of POS, along with commercial PA (98 % PA). In this <b>acidolysis</b> step four factors were studied: temperature, hexane/reaction mixture ratio, FFA/POS molar ratio {{and the intensity of}} treatment (IOT = lipase amount × reaction time/POS amount). The best results (TAGs with 79 % PA and 75 % PA at position 2) were obtained with commercial PA, at 37 ºC, 10 mL hexane/g reaction mixture, a FFA/POS molar ratio 3 : 1 (1 : 1 w/w) and an IOT = 9. 6 g lipase × h/g POS (for example 48 h, 10 g lipase and 50 g POS). PA enriched TAGs were purified neutralizing the FFAs by KOH hydroethanolic solutions and extracting the TAGs with hexane. In this way 99 % pure acylglycerols (TAG+DAG) were obtained; the recovery yield of this purification step was 95 %. The experiments carried out with POS demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} use only this oil (60 % PA, 23 % PA at position 2) as a source of PA to obtain a TAG with 70. 7 % PA and 70. 5 % PA at position 2. This process consists of four steps: (1) saponification of POS, (2) crystallization of FFAs to obtain PA enriched FFAs (75. 1 % PA), (3) <b>acidolysis</b> of POS with these FFAs, catalyzed with Novozym 435, to produce PA enriched TAGs at position 2 (70. 5 % PA) and (4) purification of TAGs to obtain approximately 95 % purity and yield. These PA enriched TAGs could be used to obtain structured TAGs rich in PA at position 2 and in oleic acid at positions 1 and 3 (OPO), which is the principal TAG of human milk fat.

40|$|Several lipases from {{microbial}} and plant, i. e Rhizomucor miehei, Pseudomonas sp., Candida antartica, rice bran, and Carica papaya latex (CPL) {{were examined}} for synthesis of omega- 3 (n- 3) PUFA-rich glyceride by hydrolysis and <b>acidolysis</b> reaction. Tuna oil {{was used in}} hydrolysis reaction, whereas tuna and palm oils were used as source of triglyceride (TAG) molecules and n- 3 PUFA concentrate from tuna oil as source of EPA and DHA in <b>acidolysis</b> reaction. For hydrolysis reaction, the rice bran and CPL lipases showed the lowest hydrolytic activity of the tuna oil, whereas the R. miehei lipase showed the highest hydrolytic activity {{but was unable to}} hydrolyze EPA and DHA. On the contrary, the C. antartica and Pseudomonas sp. lipases acted stronger on hydrolysis of DHA ester bond than EPA. For <b>acidolysis</b> reaction, all the lipases showed ability to incorporate n- 3 PUFA into tuna and palm oils. C. antartica lipase had the maximum DHA incorporation into tuna and palm oils, rice bran lipase had relatively similar ability with R. miehei lipase, and the CPL lipase had the lowest ability. This study proved that rice bran and CPL lipases also had transesterification activity and showed the feasibility of the rice bran lipase to be a biocatalyst for n- 3 PUFA-rich glyceride production. Increasing the substrate ratio, of n- 3 PUFA concentrate and tuna or palm oil, could increase the EPA and DHA incorporation. The R. miehei, rice bran, and CPL lipases unabled to incorporate DHA into DHA-containing glyceride molecule, whereas C. antartica lipase had the capability in high ratio of n- 3 PUFA concentrate to oil. Therefore, the lipases were easier to incorporate n- 3 PUFA into palm oil than tuna oil, since the TAG molecules of palm oil was not as complex as tuna oil. It could be suggested that the lipases did not only have acyl chain and positional specificity, but also the whole glyceride structure specificity...|$|E
