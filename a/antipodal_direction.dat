50|$|M37 {{is located}} in the <b>antipodal</b> <b>direction,</b> {{opposite}} from the Galactic Center as seen from Earth. Estimates of its age range from 347 million to 550 million years. It has 1,500 times the mass of the Sun and contains over 500 identified stars, with roughly 150 stars brighter than magnitude 12.5. M37 has at least a dozen red giants and its hottest surviving main sequence star is of stellar classification B9 V. The abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term metallicity, is similar to, if not slightly higher than, the abundance in the Sun.|$|E
40|$|A {{resonant}} scattering {{model for}} photon reprocessing in a pulsar accretion column is presented. The accretion column is optically thin to Thomson scattering and optically thick to resonant scattering at the cyclotron frequency. Radiation from the neutron star surface propagates freely through the column until the photon energy equals the local cyclotron frequency, {{at which point}} the radiation is scattered, much of it back toward the star. The radiation pressure in this regime is insufficient to stop the infall. Some of the scattered radiation heats the stellar surface {{around the base of the}} column, which adds a softer component to the spectrum. The partial blocking by the accretion column of X-rays from the surface produces a fan beam emission pattern. X-rays above the surface cyclotron frequency freely escape and are characterized by a pencil beam. Gravitational light bending produces a pencil beam pattern of column-scattered radiation in the <b>antipodal</b> <b>direction,</b> resulting in a strongly angle-dependent cyclotron feature...|$|E

40|$|Experiments with thermal {{demagnetization}} {{of the samples}} from Site 770 of Ocean Drilling Leg 124 indicate that the samples have two magnetic components. An assumption that the low-temperature component, which is removed between 100 °C and 200 °C, is the secondary magnetization acquired in Brunhes normal chron, gives a core orientation. The oriented high-temperature component directions were tightly clustered around a pair of <b>antipodal</b> <b>directions.</b> The change of declination of the high-temperature component shows that the Celebes Sea was rotated counterclockwise about 60 ° during Eocene and Oligocene time...|$|R
40|$|New {{high-resolution}} {{data from}} the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) have provided detailed topographic maps for {{the north and south}} polar regions. These new data allow one to compare the overall topography and geologic histories of the two polar regions and to highlight some specific outstanding questions in Mars polar studies, following earlier comparisons using Viking and Mars Global Surveyor data. The new data show that the centers of symmetry of the polar cap deposits in map view (which include both the lay-ered terrain and residual ice) are offset from the current rotational pole in <b>antipodal</b> <b>directions.</b> Offset in the north appears to be due to retreat of the polar materials from predominantly one direction (180 ◦ W). Lines of evidence for movement and melting in different forms (e. g., lobes in young craters, kettle-like depressions, candi-date residual mantles overlying polar layered terrain, and possible eskers) have been seen at both poles. The exact timing and causes o...|$|R
40|$|Miocene {{and younger}} {{volcanic}} rocks from Syria show both normal and reversed polarities after thermal demagnetisation. Similarities in site mean directions {{may be used}} to establish lavas erupted at similar times. The observed polarities suggest that some Quaternary volcanics are older than previously mapped. The site mean directions of reversed and intermediate polarity sites are more scattered than for normal polarity sites, and the overall scatter is larger than would be expected from models of secular variation simulated by westward or eastward drift of the present non axial dipole field. The normal sites are also twice as strongly magnetised as the reversed and intermediate polarity sites. The mean direction of the Quaternary sites is consistent with an axial geocentric dipole model, but the Miocene sites, while having <b>antipodal</b> <b>directions</b> for the two polarities, have a mean inclination that is shallower than the axial dipole field and may indicate persistent geomagnetic effects or possibly regional tilting...|$|R
40|$|Ginga and Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) {{observations}} {{have allowed}} an unprecedented {{view of the}} recurrent systematic pulse shape changes associated with the 35 -day cycle of Hercules X- 1, a phenomenon currently unique among the known accretion-powered pulsars. We present observations of the pulse shape evolution. An explanation for the pulse evolution {{in terms of a}} freely precessing neutron star is reviewed and shown to have several major difficulties in explaining the observed pulse evolution pattern. Instead, we propose a phenomenological model for the pulse evolution based upon an occultation of the pulse emitting region by the tilted, inner edge of a precessing accretion disk. The systematic and repeating pulse shape changes require a resolved occultation of the pulse emission region. The observed pulse profile motivates the need for a pulsar beam consisting of a composite coaxial pencil and fan beam but the observed evolution pattern requires the fan beam to be focused around the neutron star and beamed in the <b>antipodal</b> <b>direction.</b> The spectral hardness of the pencil beam component suggests an origin at the magnetic polar cap, with the relatively softer fan beam emission produced by backscattering from within the accretion column, qualitatively consistent with several theoretical models for X-ray emission from the accretion column of an accreting neutron star.

40|$|The {{alignment}} of the CMB Cold Spot and the Eridanus supervoid suggests a physical connection between these two relatively rare objects. We use galaxy catalogues with photometric (2 MPZ) and spectroscopic (6 dF) redshift measurements, supplemented by low-redshift compilations of cosmic voids, {{in order to improve}} the 3 D mapping of the matter density in the Eridanus constellation. We find evidence for a supervoid with a significant elongation in the line-of-sight, effectively spanning the total redshift range z< 0. 3. Our tomographic imaging reveals important substructure in the Eridanus supervoid, with a potential interpretation of a long, fully connected system of voids. We improve the analysis by extending the line-of-sight measurements into the <b>antipodal</b> <b>direction</b> that interestingly crosses the Northern Local Supervoid at the lowest redshifts. Then it intersects very rich superclusters like Hercules and Corona Borealis, in the region of the Coma and Sloan Great Walls, as a possible compensation for the large-scale matter deficit of Eridanus. We find that large-scale structure measurements are consistent with a central matter underdensity δ_ 0 ≈ - 0. 25, projected transverse radius r_ 0 ^≈ 195 Mpc/h with an extra deepening in the centre, and line-of-sight radius r_ 0 ^∥≈ 500 Mpc/h, i. e. an ellipsoidal supervoid. The expected integrated Sachs-Wolfe imprint of such an elongated supervoid is at the Δ T_ ISW≈ - 40 μ K level, thus inappropriate to accounting for the Cold Spot pattern in the CMB.

40|$|The {{dynamic of}} a {{cavitation}} bubble inside a water drop is investigated in microgravity {{in order to}} analyze {{the interaction between the}} collapsing bubble and a quasi-spherical free surface. Tests are carried in the frame of the 42 nd parabolic flight campaign organized by the European Space Agency (ESA). High-speed visualization revealed a significant influence of isolated, finite liquid volumes and spherical free surfaces on the bubble growth and collapse In particular; collapsing bubbles eject two liquid jets escaping from the drop in <b>antipodal</b> <b>directions.</b> The bubble lifetime is significantly shortened in good accordance with a herein derived analog of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation for bubbles in water drops. The spherical free surface leads to a broader counter jet than previously studied for flat free surfaces. The shock waves generated at the bubble collapse are spatially confined, which leads to the formation {{of a large number of}} transient micro bubbles. This phenomenon is hardly visible in the ground based experiments when bubbles are collapsing near a flat free surface within a large liquid volume...|$|R
40|$|The Meishucun secton {{has been}} {{recommended}} {{as an international}} candidate stratotype secton of the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary. The paper deals with the palaeomagnetic study on the section. A total of 159 palaeomagnetic samples were successively collected from the platform-facies sequence of carbonates and phosphates at the section. Thermal demagnetization results indicate a {{great majority of the}} rocks at the section have been strongly overprinted by recent magnetic field, but 57 samples have preserved remanent magnetization with <b>antipodal</b> <b>directions</b> (mean D / 1 = 4. 2 ° / 7. 1 °, K= 9, Α 95 = 6. 6 °). Baaed on calculation, the location of the palaeomagnetic pole was at 68. 8 ° N and 270. 7 ° E, which is different from any palaeopoles obtained from younger Phanerozoic rocks in South China. The results reveal a polarity zonation which includes at least 9 reversal events. A comparison of China' s magnetostratigraphic records with those from Siberia, Australia and the western U. S. A. shows that all the sections are characterized by frequent polarity reversals'...|$|R
40|$|Characteristic magnetizations from Middle Jurassic dacitic to andesitic subaerial volcanics (the Fulstone and Artesia Formations) in the Buckskin Mountain Range, western central Basin and Range Province, are well-grouped, {{generally}} display univectorial decays to {{the origin}} in demagnetization and have hematite blocking temperatures restricted almost entirely to above 620 [deg]C. Petrographic, rock magnetic and electron microprobe investigations confirm that nearly pure hematite {{is the essential}} magnetic phase (up to about 10 vol. %) occurring as a replacement of coarse titaniferous magnetite phenocrysts and fine groundmass particles, as a secondary alteration product of ferromagnesian phenocrysts and as a mobilized phase filling cracks and other open spaces. The presence of <b>antipodal</b> <b>directions</b> in each flow unit and in interbedded volcanoclastic units (some having retained magnetite as a major magnetic phase) and magnetite-dominated remanences in time-equivalent intrusives cutting the flows indicates that the volcanics acquired their hematite remanence, a faithful record of the geomagnetic field, in high-temperature, deuteric oxidation during and following their emplacement, not during a later thermal event such as regional metamorphism. The remanence is probably a thermochemical remanent magnetization, although part may be of thermoremanent origin...|$|R
40|$|Sampling of an {{industrial}} drill string from the northeastern Paris Basin (Montcornet, France) provides early Jurassic magnetostratigraphic data coupled with biochronological control. About 375 paleomagnetic samples {{were obtained from}} a 145 m thick series of Pliensbachian rocks. A composite demagnetization thermal up to 300 C and an alternating field up to 80 mT were used to separate the magnetic components. A low unblocking temperature component (< 250 degreesC) with an inclination of about 64 is interpreted as a present-day field overprint. The characteristic remanent component with both normal and reversed <b>antipodal</b> <b>directions</b> was isolated between 5 and 50 mT. Twenty-nine polarity intervals were recognized. Correlation of these new results from the Paris Basin with data from the Breggia Gorge section (Ticino, southern Alps, Switzerland), which is generally considered as the reference section for Pliensbachian magnetostratigraphy, reveals almost identical patterns of magnetic polarity reversals. However, the correlation implies significant paleontological age discrepancies. Revised age assignments of biostratigraphic data of Breggia {{as well as an}} objective evaluation of the uncertainties on zonal boundaries in both Breggia and Moncornet resolve the initial discrepancies between magnetostratigraphic correlations and biostratigraphic ages. Hence, the sequence of magnetic reversals is significantly strengthened and the age calibration is notably improved for the Pliensbachian, a stage for which sections combining adequate magnetic signal and biostratigraphic constraints are still very few.

40|$|We {{perform an}} {{analysis}} of the CMB temperature data taken by the Planck satellite investigating if there is any significant deviation from cosmological isotropy. We look for differences in the spectrum between two opposite hemispheres and also for dipolar modulations. We propose a new way to avoid biases due to partial-sky coverage by producing a mask symmetrized in <b>antipodal</b> <b>directions,</b> in addition to the standard smoothing procedure. We also properly take into account both Doppler and aberration effects due to our peculiar velocity and the anisotropy of the noise, since these effects induce a significant hemispherical asymmetry. We are thus able to probe scales all the way to ell = 2000. After such treatment we find no evidence for significant hemispherical anomalies (i. e. deviations are less than 1. 5 sigma when summing over all scales). Although among the larger scales there are sometimes higher discrepancies, these are always less than 3 sigma. We also find results on a dipolar modulation of the power spectrum. Along the hemispheres aligned with the most asymmetric direction for 2 <= ell <= 2000 we find a 3. 3 sigma discrepancy when comparing to simulations. However, if we do not restrict ourselves to Planck's maximal asymmetry axis, which can only be known a posteriori, and compare Planck data with the modulation of simulations along their respective maximal asymmetry directions, the discrepancy goes down to less than 1 sigma (with, again, almost 3 sigma discrepancies in some low-ell modes). We thus conclude that no significant power asymmetries seem to be present in the full data set. Interestingly, without proper removal of Doppler and aberration effects one would find spurious anomalies at high ell, between 3 sigma and 5 sigma. Even when considering only ell < 600 we find that the boost is non-negligible and alleviates the discrepancy by roughly half-sigma.
