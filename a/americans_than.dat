5|$|Both {{candidates}} {{believed that}} the states of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut would determine the election. In New York, Blaine received less support than he anticipated when Arthur and Conkling, still powerful in the New York Republican party, failed to actively campaign for him. Blaine hoped {{that he would have}} more support from Irish <b>Americans</b> <b>than</b> Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine’s mother was Irish Catholic, and he believed his career-long opposition to the British government would resonate with the Irish. Blaine’s hope for Irish defections to the Republican standard were dashed late in the campaign when one of his supporters, Samuel D. Burchard, gave a speech denouncing the Democrats as the party of “Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.” The Democrats spread the word of this insult {{in the days before the}} election, and Cleveland narrowly won all four of the swing states, including New York by just over one thousand votes. While the popular vote total was close, with Cleveland winning by just one-quarter of a percent, the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219–182.|$|E
25|$|After two trials, BiDil was {{licensed}} {{exclusively for}} use in African American patients. Critics have argued that this particular licensing was unwarranted, since the trials did not in fact show that the drug was more effective in African <b>Americans</b> <b>than</b> in other groups, but merely {{that it was more}} effective in African <b>Americans</b> <b>than</b> other similar drugs. It was also only tested in African American males, but not in any other racial groups or among women. This peculiar trial and licensing procedure has prompted suggestions that the licensing was in fact used as a race-based advertising scheme.|$|E
25|$|The Reconstruction Era {{played out}} {{differently}} in Indian Territory and for Native <b>Americans</b> <b>than</b> {{for the rest}} of the country. In 1862, Congress passed a law that allowed the president, by proclamation, to cancel treaties with Indian Nations siding with the Confederacy (25 USC 72).|$|E

25|$|In an {{interview}} with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Paul asserted that racism is incompatible with his beliefs and that he sees people as individuals, not as part of collectives. He also dismissed the attack {{as an attempt to}} accuse him of racism by proxy, claiming that he had collected more money among African <b>Americans</b> <b>than</b> any other Republican candidate.|$|E
25|$|Although most {{governments in}} the world are, as they always have been, autocracies {{of one kind or}} another, no idea hold greater sway in the mind of educated <b>Americans</b> <b>than</b> the belief that it is {{possible}} to democratize governments, anytime, anywhere, under any circumstances... (But) decades, if not centuries, are normally required for people to acquire the necessary disciplines and habits.|$|E
25|$|Israel {{applied to}} join the US government's Visa Waiver Program in 2005. The program permits {{citizens}} of selected countries to enter the US for up to 90 days without having to apply for an entry visa. The Senate rejected the bid because not all Israeli citizens own a biometric passport, the entry visa rejection rate for Israelis exceeded 3%, and Israel insists on stricter security checks for Palestinian <b>Americans</b> <b>than</b> other American citizens.|$|E
25|$|For {{groups of}} years, some style guides prefer 1960s to 1960’s and 90s or ’90s to 90’s or ’90's. This {{use of an}} {{apostrophe}} may be more acceptable in <b>American</b> <b>than</b> in British English.|$|R

50|$|However, American-Jewish {{literature}} has also strongly celebrated American life. It has been primarily more an <b>American</b> <b>than</b> a Jewish literature. Perhaps the preeminent {{example of this}} is the great breakthrough novel of Saul Bellow The Adventures of Augie March.|$|R
25|$|In August 2012, Romney {{indicated}} that he might retain parts of Obamacare such as coverage for pre-existing conditions, but this was quickly clarified as only ensuring insurance coverage for people who already had insurance coverage. In September 2012, Romney highlighted his success in providing government subsidizes to ensure medical coverage for all the children of Massachusetts. And in October the Romney campaign questioned the assumptions behind a Commonwealth Fund report that Romney's policies would provide health care insurance for 45 million fewer <b>Americans</b> <b>than</b> Obama's policies.|$|E
25|$|Like many abolitionists, Douglass {{believed}} that education would be crucial for African Americans {{to improve their}} lives. This led Douglass to become an early advocate for school desegregation. In the 1850s, Douglass observed that New York's facilities and instruction for African-American children were vastly inferior to those for whites. Douglass called for court action to open all schools to all children. He said that full inclusion within the educational system was a more pressing need for African <b>Americans</b> <b>than</b> political issues such as suffrage.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{compelling}} reason for increasing the emphasis on this southern drive {{had more to do}} with the actions of <b>Americans</b> <b>than</b> those of Germans. While Montgomery was carefully and cautiously planning for the main thrust in the north, complete with massive artillery preparation and an airborne assault, American forces in the south were displaying the kind of basic aggressiveness that Eisenhower wanted to see. On 7 March, Lieutenant General Courtney Hodges's U.S. 1st Army captured the last intact bridge over the Rhine at Remagen and steadily expanded the bridgehead.|$|E
5000|$|According to a 2011 {{columnist}} in The Rafu Shimpo of Los Angeles, [...] "Younger Japanese Americans {{are more}} culturally <b>American</b> <b>than</b> Japanese" [...] and [...] "other than some vestigial cultural affiliations, a Yonsei or Gosei is simply another American." ...|$|R
40|$|Possible {{permanent}} down {{regulation of}} oestrogen receptor expression during fetal life {{and breast cancer}} risk Sir Oestrogen production rates in blood levels are higher among white <b>American</b> <b>than</b> among Chinese women (Bernstein et al, 1990) and higher oestrogen levels {{have been associated with}} higher risk for breast cancer (Lipworth et al, 1996; Toniolo, 1997). Thus, the recent finding (Lipworth et al, 1999) that oestrogens during pregnancy are higher among Chinese <b>than</b> among white <b>American</b> women appears to contradict the hypothesis that pregnancy oestrogens are positively associated with breast cancer risk in the offspring, because the incidence of breast cancer is five times higher among <b>American</b> <b>than</b> among Chinese women. A possible explanation, however, for the apparent contradiction is down-regulatio...|$|R

500|$|In December 2013, Johnson {{announced}} {{the founding of}} his own Super PAC, Our America Initiative PAC. The Super PAC is intended to support libertarian-minded causes.

500|$|Cha Woo-jin, a South Korean music critic, told The Chosun Ilbo that [...] "Gangnam Style"'s {{sophisticated}} rendering and arrangement {{has made}} it very appealing to the general public. Choe Kwang-shik, the South Korean Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism, told reporters that [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] had {{played an important role in}} introducing the Korean culture, language, and lifestyle to the rest of the world. However, some have criticized the song for failing to accurately represent South Korean culture. Oh Young-Jin, managing editor of The Korea Times, wrote that the dance has more to do with <b>Americans</b> <b>than</b> Koreans.|$|E
500|$|As ready workers, the Swedes were {{generally}} welcomed by the Americans, who often singled them {{out as the}} [...] "best" [...] immigrants. There was no significant anti-Swedish nativism {{of the sort that}} attacked Irish, German and, especially, Chinese newcomers. The Swedish style was more familiar: [...] "They are not peddlers, nor organ grinders, nor beggars; they do not sell ready-made clothing nor keep pawn shops", wrote the Congregational missionary M. W. Montgomery in 1885; [...] "they do not seek the shelter of the American flag merely to introduce and foster among us... socialism, nihilism, communism... they are more like <b>Americans</b> <b>than</b> are any other foreign peoples." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{the sixth}} day of Mr. Direck's {{first visit to}} England, and {{he was at his}} acutest {{perception}} of differences. He found England in every way gratifying and satisfactory, and more of a contrast with things <b>American</b> <b>than</b> he had ever dared to hope.|$|R
6000|$|... "So I {{have been}} told; but, as no loss has fallen on any {{who are very}} near to me, my public virtue {{has been able to}} resist private feeling. My brother, as you may have seen, is less of an <b>American</b> <b>than</b> I am myself." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Tampico" [...] is {{the title}} of a 1945 song {{composed}} by U.S. artists Allan Roberts and Doris Fisher and produced by jazz musician and conductor Stan Kenton, with lead vocals by June Christy.

500|$|The {{electoral votes}} of closely contested New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut would {{determine}} the election. In New York, the Tammany Democrats {{decided that they}} would gain more from supporting a Democrat they disliked than a Republican who would do nothing for them. Blaine hoped {{that he would have}} more support from Irish <b>Americans</b> <b>than</b> Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine's mother was Irish Catholic, and he had been supportive of the Irish National Land League while he was Secretary of State. The Irish, a significant group in three of the swing states, did appear inclined to support Blaine until a Republican, Samuel D. Burchard, gave a speech pivotal for the Democrats, denouncing them as the party of [...] "Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion." [...] The Democrats spread the word of this implied Catholic insult {{on the eve of the}} election. They also blistered Blaine for attending a banquet with some of New York City's wealthiest men.|$|E
500|$|Although Harding's first {{address to}} Congress called for passage of anti-lynching legislation, he {{initially}} seemed inclined to {{do no more}} for African <b>Americans</b> <b>than</b> Republican presidents of the recent past had; he asked cabinet officers to find places for blacks in their departments. Sinclair suggested {{that the fact that}} Harding received two-fifths of the Southern vote in 1920 led him to see political opportunity for his party in the Solid South. On October 26, 1921, Harding gave a speech in Birmingham, Alabama, to a segregated audience of 20,000 whites and 10,000 blacks. Harding, while stating that the social and racial differences between whites and blacks could not be bridged, urged equal political rights for the African American. Many African Americans at that time voted Republican, especially in the Democratic South, and Harding stated he did not mind seeing that support end if the result was a strong two-party system in the South. He was willing to see literacy tests for voting continue, if applied fairly to white and black. [...] "Whether you like it or not," [...] Harding told his segregated audience, [...] "unless our democracy is a lie, you must stand for that equality." [...] The white section of the audience listened in silence while the black section cheered.|$|E
500|$|Kala was {{met with}} {{widespread}} critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 87, based on 37 reviews. In the Los Angeles Times, Ann Powers wrote that Kala succeeded at embodying disenfranchised characters in the dissonant Third World with [...] "truly multi-vocal" [...] music whose [...] "every sound signified something different, driving the music's meaning into some new corner". Andy Battaglia from The A.V. Club said the music ventured far enough where it served as both a party album and a progressive aural assault, while AllMusic's Andy Kellman felt that Kala was better for intensifying Arulars qualities and [...] "mixing cultures with respectful irreverence". Barry Walters of Spin credited M.I.A. with evoking both the social demands and percussive sounds of the Third World, while finding the album relevant {{at a time when}} [...] "more <b>Americans</b> <b>than</b> ever feel like outsiders in their own country". Writing for MSN Music, Robert Christgau said the lyrics were [...] "cannier politically" [...] than Arular, and the music was more decisive in embodying the imagination and recreation of [...] "an unbowed international underclass that proves how smart it is just by stating its business, which includes taking your money". He later said that he had [...] "pressed" [...] the editors of Rolling Stone to let him give Kala four-and-a-half stars in his review for the magazine, wishing he [...] "had the foresight to fight for five" [...] because the album [...] "kept growing on me till I even dug the Timbaland remnant [...] ".|$|E

2500|$|In March 2017, Price {{endorsed}} the American Health Care Act of 2017, a bill proposed by House Republicans that would repeal the individual mandate and make several other major {{changes to the}} Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. When the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the American Health Care Act would insure 24 million fewer <b>Americans</b> <b>than</b> the Affordable Care Act by 2026 and reduce the federal deficit by $337 billion in the same span, Price said he disagreed [...] "strenuously" [...] with the report and found it [...] "not believable".|$|E
2500|$|In that piece, Kirkpatrick {{mentioned}} {{what she}} saw as a difference between authoritarian regimes and the totalitarian regimes such as the Soviet Union; sometimes, {{it was necessary to}} work with authoritarian regimes if it suited American purposes: [...] "No idea holds greater sway in the mind of educated <b>Americans</b> <b>than</b> the belief {{that it is possible to}} democratize governments, anytime and anywhere, under any circumstances... Decades, if not centuries, are normally required for people to acquire the necessary disciplines and habits. In Britain, the road [...] took seven centuries to traverse...
