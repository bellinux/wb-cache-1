In the present study, we have used fluorescence photobleaching recovery (FPR) to quantify the effects of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and immune interferon (IFN-gamma) on the lateral mobilities of class I major histocompatibility complex protein, of an abundant 96, 000 Mr mesenchymal cell surface glycoprotein (gp 96), and of a phospholipid probe in cultured human endothelial cell (HEC) membranes. Class I protein and gp 96 were directly labeled with fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibodies; plasma membrane lipid mobility was examined with the phospholipid analogue fluorescein phosphatidylethanolamine (Fl-PE). In untreated, confluent HEC monolayers, diffusion coefficients were 30 x 10 (- 10) cm 2 s- 1 for class I protein, 14 x 10 (- 10) cm 2 s- 1 for gp 96, and 80 x 10 (- 10) cm 2 s- 1 for Fl-PE. Fractional mobilities were greater than 80 % for each probe. Cultures treated at visual confluence for 3 - 4 d with either 100 U/ml TNF or 200 U/ml IFN-gamma did not exhibit significant changes in protein or lipid mobilities despite significant changes in cell morphology and membrane <b>antigen</b> <b>composition.</b> In HEC cultures treated concomitantly with TNF and IFN-gamma, however, diffusion coefficients decreased by 71 - 79 % for class I protein, 29 - 55 % for gp 96, and 23 - 38 % for Fl-PE. Fractional mobilities were unchanged. By immunoperoxidase transmission electron microscopy, plasma membranes of untreated and cytokine-treated HEC were flat and stained uniformly for class I antigen. "Line" FPR measurements on doubly treated HEC demonstrated isotropic diffusion of class I protein, gp 96, and Fl-PE. Finally, although TNF and IFN-gamma retarded the growth of HEC cultures and disrupted the organization of cell monolayers, the slow diffusion rates of gp 96 and Fl-PE in confluent doubly treated monolayers were not reproduced in sparse or subconfluent untreated monolayers. We conclude that the slowing of protein and lipid diffusion induced by the combination of TNF and IFN-gamma is not due to plasma membrane corrugations, to anisotropic diffusion barriers, or to decreased numbers of cell-cell contacts.

40|$|Latent {{autoimmune}} diabetes {{of adults}} (LADA) is {{a variant of}} autoimmune diabetes mellitus. Its clinical feature not typical for classical DM 1 {{despite the presence of}} positive autoantibodies is characterized by the low rate of autoimmune destruction that accounts for the late development of insulin dependence. Similar to classical DM 1, LADA is associated with the loss of immune tolerance to autoantibodies. However, the quantitative and functional activity of Treg as key regulators of the immune response and main agents of immune tolerance remain as poorly known as their relationship with characteristics of apoptosis. Aim. To elucidate qualitative and functional changes at the level of immunity regulation in patients with LADA of different duration and their relationships with characteristics of apoptosis, immunological and genetic markers. Materials and methods. The study included 64 patients (45 men and 19 women) with LADA and 56 control subjects. The methods included HLA genotyping, detection of autoantibodies against GAD, insulin, tyrosine phosphatase, islet cell <b>antigens,</b> <b>composition</b> of CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 38 +, HLA DR+, CD 25 +, CD+ 25 +, CD 95, CD 95 L lymphocyte subpopulations, FoxP 3 and C-peptide expression, HbA 1 c levels. Results. FoxP 3 expression at the onset of LADA was similar to that in control subjects while the relative amount of CD 425 +high T-lymphocytes increased. In contrast to DM 1, FoxP 3 expression began to decrease 6 - 12 months after the onset of LADA when the amount of CD 425 +high T-lymphocytes lowered to become normal with the progress of the disease. Within 1 - 5 years after the onset of LADA, FoxP 3 expression became normal again but significantly increased when its duration exceeded 5 years. Expression of apoptosis markers (CD 95 and CD 95 L) on lymphocytes and of their soluble forms in all LADA patients was comparable with control. Conclusion. We for the first time determined intensity of FoxP 3 expression and the amount of CD 425 +high T-lymphocytes in patients with different duration of LADA. FoxP 3 expression varies periodically while functional deficit of Treg is delayed and appears to be compensated by a rise in their number. Increased population of Treg within 6 months after the onset of LADA may reflect their regulatory role (suppression of autoimmunity) accounting for the gradual development of the disease...|$|R

Thus far, attempts to develop effective leptospirosis vaccines, both for humans and animals, have failed to induce immune responses capable of conferring protection and simultaneously preventing renal coloni-zation. In this study, we evaluated the protective immunity induced by subunit vaccines containing seven different recombinant Leptospira interrogans outer membrane proteins, including the carboxy-terminal portion of the immunoglobulinlike protein A (LigAC) and six novel antigens, combined with aluminum hydroxide (alum) or Salmonella flagellin (FliC) as adjuvants. Ham-sters vaccinated with the different formulations elicited high antigen-specific antibody titers. Immunization with LigAC, either with alum or flagellin, conferred protective immunity but did not prevent renal colonization. Similarly, animals immunized with LigAC or LigAC coadministered with six leptospiral proteins with alum adjuvant conferred protection but did not reduce renal colonization.

Brief review: The Hymenoptera species, which are most important in the context of venom allergy, include the common wasp (Vespula vulgaris), German wasp (Vespula germanica), and the honey bee (Apis mellifera). Depending on the population, systemic allergic reactions occur in 1. 5 – 8. 9 % of cases. Every year, anaphylactic reactions cause about 40 deaths in the United States and approximately 100 deaths in Europe. Although venoms of various insects differ in terms of their <b>antigen</b> <b>composition,</b> they can show cross-reactivity. Allergic reactions are classified as local or systemic. The IgE-dependent reaction constitutes the most frequent mechanisms responsible for insect venom hypersensitivity.

Intramuscular injection of adrenaline is the procedure of choice in the case of anaphylactic reaction. Immunotherapy has an established the efficacy in the prevention of an anaphylactic reaction in individuals who are sensitive to Hymenoptera venoms.

To elucidate the recogni-tion pattern of melanoma TILs both stud-ies used a recently generated library of all published T cell epitopes of relevance for melanoma that includes 175 MHC-class I peptides restricted to HLA-A 1, A 2, A 3, A 11 and B 7. 2 Screening of peptide-specific T cell responses was conducted by MHC-multimers, generated by peptide exchange from conditional ligand-HLA complexes and combinatorially encoded with dif-ferent fluorescence molecules to generate unique two-color codes allowing parallel detection of large numbers of different The <b>antigen</b> specific <b>composition</b> of melanoma tumor infiltrating lymphocytes?

40|$|Cajal bodies (also {{known as}} coiled bodies) are {{subnuclear}} organelles that contain specific nuclear antigens, including splicing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and {{a subset of}} nucleolar proteins. Cajal bodies are localized in the nucleoplasm and are often found at the nucleolar periphery. We have constructed a stable HeLa cell line, HeLaGFP-coilin, that expresses the Cajal body marker protein, p 80 coilin, fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP-coilin). The localization pattern and biochemical properties of the GFP-coilin fusion protein are identical to the endogenous p 80 coilin. Time-lapse recordings on 63 nuclei of HeLaGFP-coilin cells showed that all Cajal bodies move within the nucleoplasm. Movements included translocations through the nucleoplasm, joining of bodies to form larger structures, and separation of smaller bodies from larger Cajal bodies. Also, we observed Cajal bodies moving to and from nucleoli. The data suggest {{that there may be}} at least two classes of Cajal bodies that differ in their size, <b>antigen</b> <b>composition,</b> and dynamic behavior. The smaller size class shows more frequent and faster rates of movement, up to 0. 9 μm/min. The GFP-coilin protein is dynamically associated with Cajal bodies as shown by changes in their fluorescence intensity over time. This study reveals an unexpectedly high level of movement and interactions of nuclear bodies in human cells and suggests that these movements may be driven, at least in part, by regulated mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Human macrophages play a {{key role}} in {{atherogenesis}} and are believed to be the progenitors of the cholesteryl ester (CE) -laden foam cells present in early atherosclerotic lesions. Several mechanisms by which macrophages accumulate CE have been recently described. One involves a perturbation in LDL metabolism subsequent to macrophage activation. Thus, we decided to study the effect of macrophage activation by immune complexes on N-LDL metabolism. Initially, LDL-containing immune complexes (LDL-IC) were chosen, since increased plasma levels of these IC have been reported in patients with coronary heart disease. Human macrophages stimulated for 22 h with LDL-IC (250 micrograms/ml) and incubated afterwards for 20 h with 10 micrograms/ml 125 I-N-LDL showed a six- and fourfold increase in the accumulation and degradation, respectively, of 125 I-N-LDL over the values observed in nonstimulated cells. Scatchard analysis of 125 I-N-LDL-specific binding suggests an increase (20 -fold) in the number of LDL receptors in macrophages stimulated with LDL-IC. We studied other immune complexes varying in size and <b>antigen</b> <b>composition.</b> Some of the IC were able to stimulate, although to a lesser degree, the uptake of N-LDL by macrophages. Lipoprotein IC are more efficient and have the greatest capacity to increase N-LDL uptake and CE accumulation. We conclude that human macrophage activation by LDL-IC leads to an increase in LDL receptor activity and promotes in vitro foam cell formation...|$|E
40|$|Atrophic {{rhinitis}} (AR) is {{a widespread}} and economically important disease of swine caused by Bordetella bronchiseptica and Pasteurella multocida. It can be controlled by vaccination. This study investigates the effect of altering the composition (adjuvants and/or addition of formalin-inactivated P. multocida toxin, fPMT) of conventional vaccines on the serological profile and on protection against AR in swine. A significantly higher B. bronchiseptica specific antibody titre was detected for vaccines with novel immunostimulants, the best being Montanide IMS 1313 (1 : 630 compared to 1 : 274 obtained with alum). The highest B. bronchiseptica antibody titre was demonstrated for a combination of B. bronchiseptica — fPMT, while PMT antibody titre was highest for monovalent fPMT (both adjuvanted with IMS 1313). The AR-specific antibodies were transmitted from dams to their offspring in similar titres and with the same hierarchy of effectiveness. After a B. bronchiseptica — P. multocida bacterial challenge, piglets from dams vaccinated with fPMT combined with B. bronchiseptica or B. bronchiseptica — P. multocida bacterins showed the lowest nasal lesions scores (4. 5 and 3. 2, respectively, {{out of a possible}} maximum score of 18). These combinations, both of which were adjuvanted with IMS 1313, gave the best protection against experimentally induced AR. Our results show that the adjuvant and the <b>antigen</b> <b>composition</b> of the vaccine strongly affect seroconversion, and that the AR-specific antibody titre does not necessarily correlate with the degree of protection...|$|E
40|$|Cutaneous {{hypersensitivity}} {{responses to}} brucella <b>antigens</b> of different <b>composition</b> were studied in guinea pigs sensitized by infection with smooth brucella or immunization with killed rough brucella in adjuvant. These animals had circulating antibodies to smooth lipopolysaccharide or protein antigens, respectively. Intradermal skin tests, active cutaneous anaphylaxis, passive cutaneous anaphylaxis, and immunodiffusion tests were performed. Delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions uncomplicated by accompanying antibody-mediated reactions were seen only in infected guinea pigs with protein antigen that was entirely free of lipopolysaccharide. In the adjuvant-immunized animals, the protein antigen evoked overlapping antibody-mediated and delayed-type reactions. Lipopolysaccharide and polysaccharide preparations contained varying amounts of protein components. In infected animals, reactions of these antigens were clearly antibody mediated, but participation of delayed-type hypersensitivity {{could not be}} excluded. In adjuvant-immunized animals, the antibody-mediated reaction to the lipopolysaccharide preparation was caused by its protein component...|$|R
40|$|Current {{thinking}} {{attributes the}} balance between T helper 1 (Th 1) and Th 2 cytokine response patterns in immune responses {{to the nature of}} the <b>antigen,</b> the genetic <b>composition</b> of the host, and the cytokines involved in the early interaction between T cells and antigen-presenting cells. Here we introduce glutathione, a tripeptide that regulates intracellular redox and other aspects of cell physiology, as a key regulatory element in this process. By using three different methods to deplete glutathione from T cell receptor transgenic and conventional mice and studying in vivo and/or in vitro responses to three distinct antigens, we show that glutathione levels in antigen-presenting cells determine whether Th 1 or Th 2 response patterns predominate. These findings present new insights into immune response alterations in HIV and other diseases. Further, they potentially offer an explanation for the well known differences in immune responses in “Th 1 ” and “Th 2 ” mouse strains...|$|R
40|$|Carbohydrate-based {{vaccines}} {{have shown}} therapeutic efficacy for infectious disease and cancer. The mushroom Ganoderma lucidum (Reishi) containing complex polysaccharides {{has been used}} as antitumor supplement, but the mechanism of immune response has rarely been studied. Here, we show that the mice immunized with a l-fucose (Fuc) -enriched Reishi polysaccharide fraction (designated as FMS) induce antibodies against murine Lewis lung carcinoma cells, with increased antibody-mediated cytotoxicity and reduced production of tumor-associated inflammatory mediators (in particular, monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1). The mice showed {{a significant increase in the}} peritoneal B 1 B-cell population, suggesting FMS-mediated anti-glycan IgM production. Furthermore, the glycan microarray analysis of FMS-induced antisera displayed a high specificity toward tumor-associated glycans, with the antigenic structure located in the nonreducing termini (i. e., Fucα 1 - 2 Galβ 1 - 3 GalNAc-R, where Gal, GalNAc, and R represent, respectively, D-galactose, D-N-acetyl galactosamine, and reducing end), typically found in Globo H and related tumor <b>antigens.</b> The <b>composition</b> of FMS contains mainly the backbone of 1, 4 -mannan and 1, 6 -α-galactan and through the Fucα 1 - 2 Gal, Fucα 1 - 3 / 4 Man, Fucα 1 - 4 Xyl, and Fucα 1 - 2 Fuc linkages (where Man and Xyl represent d-mannose and d-xylose, respectively), underlying the molecular basis of the FMS-induced IgM antibodies against tumor-specific glycans.
