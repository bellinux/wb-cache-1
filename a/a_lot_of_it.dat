[...] KutMasta Kurt also recounts a conversation with Thornton on a European flight in December 2006, in which Thornton stated that The Return of Dr. Octagon does not sound like a Dr. Octagon album. Thornton himself said that he liked the album's production, but that the album hurt his reputation as a musician. According to Thornton, [...] "I'm not mad. But I don't repeat words when I rap.

500|$|Chamber pop {{was part}} of a larger trend which {{involved}} musicians who rejected traditional rock conventions, such as Tortoise and Stereolab, although those specific bands are not considered ork-pop. [...] The genre's orchestration is typically more complex than rock music, making extensive use of brass and strings. It drew from the 1990s lounge music revival but avoided any influence from other contemporary styles like grunge, electronica, or alternative music, particularly the lo-fi hiss and distortion of the last. Although modern rock groups like Smashing Pumpkins, Oasis, and R.E.M. occasionally used strings, their approach was considerably less intricate. The High Llamas were one of the first to anticipate the easy-listening fad with their 1993 debut album Gideon Gaye. O'Hagan felt that [...] "There is this whole misconception that American college rock with twisted baseball hats and checked shirts is adventurous, but it's the most conformist, corporate thing out there.... All these bands sound like Nirvana and Pearl Jam. It's a shame that it couldn't be discovered from the get-go for what it is. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is just very simple dumb-guy rock." ...|$|E

[...] In terms of her own personal style, Sevigny cited the Australian film Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), which features schoolgirls dressed in elaborate Victorian clothing, as a major inspiration; she has also cited it as one of her favorite films. She has also been outspoken in her favoritism of vintage clothing over designer pieces: [...] "I still prefer to buy vintage over spending it all on one designer", she told The Times. [...] "I'll go to Resurrection or Decades and be like, 'Oh, I'm going to buy everything,' but <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is extremely expensive, so I'll go to Wasteland and satisfy that urge and it's not too hard on the pocketbook.

500|$|All of Ecstasys seven {{tracks were}} written and {{composed}} by Kevin Shields, with Colm Ó Cíosóig credited as the co-writer of three tracks—"The Things I Miss", [...] "Clair" [...] and [...] "(Please) Lose Yourself in Me". Regarding the lyrical {{content of the}} album {{in contrast to the}} music, Shields said that [...] "the songs may sound sweet, but the subject matter isn't necessarily very nice. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is relationship-based, but it's always vague, and never just boy-meets-girl. It could easily be boy-meets-boy, or girl-meets-girl. Then there's hate, and whimsical thoughts you get from nowhere". Ó Cíosóig remarked that [...] "it's more weird perversions of feeling you get in a relationship" [...] and referred to the lyrics as being marked by [...] "extremes, because we're entertained by extreme things". Shields noted that the lyrics were a progression from the band's earlier releases as [...] "the idea of composing a sweet pop song that sugar-coated some lyrical horror and sending it hurtling up the charts appealed to our sense of humour" [...] and considered the songwriting process for Ecstasy as [...] "fresh after having made pure noise earlier".|$|E

Bannon witnessed a younger sorority sister's unabashed infatuation with the older sister. She recalls it was an awkward situation, even though the older sorority sister was [...] "unfailingly gracious" [...] to the younger one. In recognizing the younger woman's attractions, she began to suspect her own sexuality. She said, [...] "I saw <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> happening and I didn't {{know what to make}} of it. I don't even know how to put it—I was absolutely consumed with it, it was an extraordinary thing." [...] Another sorority sister was physically remarkable, very tall—almost , with a husky voice and boyish nickname, that Bannon imagined was a blend of Johnny Weissmuller and Ingrid Bergman. She recalled entering the communal restroom and seeing the sister, [...] "both of us in underwear, and experienc(ing) a sort of electric shock", and trying not to stare at her. In 1954, she graduated with a degree in French and soon married an engineer whose job made them relocate frequently.|$|E

[...] When asked about a possible reunion in an interview that year, Avory stated, [...] "A reunion would not be possible with the originals, for a start due to ill health. But it would be possible with the Kast Off Kinks plus Ray. In any event Ray would record new material. We have some old tracks from the 80s as well." [...] In March 2010, Avory reported that the band were planning on releasing an album of unreleased and new material. He stated that they had [...] "eight tracks" [...] ready for the album, but that the Davies brothers had to settle their differences before the project could progress.

What makes them soar is not the imaginative staging of the future, but Leto's performance. His acting talent really comes into full view in his scenes as the last dying man on Earth." [...] He also praised Regbo and Temple, saying [...] "Regbo, as the teenage Nemo, and Juno Temple, as the teenage Anna, are impressive, bringing the hormonal battles of adolescence vividly to life." [...] Film critic Eric Lavallée listed Regbo as one of his [...] "Top 10 New Faces & Voices" [...] of 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. He notes that [...] "newbie Toby Regbo might easily be Mr. Nobody's most [...] "alive" [...] character.

500|$|In {{an early}} {{review by the}} trade {{magazine}} The Hollywood Reporter, Todd McCarthy said that, [...] "After nearly crashing and burning on his last solo flight in 2010, Iron Man returns refreshed and ready for action in this spirited third installment... benefits immeasurably from the irreverent quicksilver humor of co-writer and director Shane Black. Calling the film [...] "darker and more serious than its predecessors," [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times credited Black for [...] "chang this billion-dollar-plus franchise's tone for the better while keeping the same actor as Tony Stark. ... There is {{quite a bit of}} Black's trademark attitude and humor here as well, things like a throwaway reference to the sci-fi classic Westworld and a goofy character who has Tony Stark's likeness tattooed on his forearm. Black and company throw all kinds of stuff at the audience, and though it doesn't all work, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> does and the attempt to be different and create unguessable twists is always appreciated." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday characterized Iron Man as [...] "the anti-Batman, all zip and zingers. He's also, suddenly, rather family-friendly. Some of the movie's best moments are shared by Stark and latchkey kid Harley (Ty Simpkins), who mock their budding father-son relationship while acting it out." [...] Psychology Today concluded that the film presented an accurate portrayal of Tony Stark's posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.|$|E

O'Brien said that [...] "the biggest pressure was actually completing [...] We weren't given any deadlines and we had complete freedom to do what we wanted. We were delaying it because we were a bit frightened of actually finishing stuff." [...] Yorke was satisfied with the quality of the recordings made at the location, and enjoyed working without audio separation, meaning that instruments were not overdubbed separately. O'Brien was similarly pleased with the recordings, estimating that 80 per cent of the album was recorded live, and said: [...] "I hate doing overdubs, because it just doesn't feel natural.... Something special happens when you're playing live; <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is just looking at one another and knowing there are four other people making it happen."
