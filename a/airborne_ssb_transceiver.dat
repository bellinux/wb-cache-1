50|$|A {{standalone}} ALE radio combines an HF <b>SSB</b> radio <b>transceiver</b> with {{an internal}} microprocessor and MFSK modem. It is programmed {{with a unique}} ALE address, similar to a phone number (or on newer generations, a username). When not actively in contact with another station, the HF <b>SSB</b> <b>transceiver</b> constantly scans through a list of HF frequencies called channels, listening for any ALE signals transmitted by other radio stations. It decodes calls and soundings sent by other stations and uses the bit error rate to store a quality score for that frequency and sender-address.|$|R
50|$|Generally, email {{communications}} over amateur {{radio in}} the 21st century is now considered normal and commonplace. Email via High frequency (HF) can be used nearly everywhere on the planet, and is made possible by connecting an HF single sideband (<b>SSB)</b> <b>transceiver</b> system to a computer, modem interface, and appropriate software. The HF modem technologies include PACTOR, Winmor, and Automatic Link Establishment (ALE).|$|R
50|$|Fldigi, the Fast Light Digital modem application, is a {{free and}} {{open-source}} program which allows an ordinary computer's sound card {{to be used as}} a simple two-way data modem. The software is mostly used by amateur radio operators who connect the microphone and headphone connections of an amateur radio <b>SSB</b> <b>transceiver</b> or an FM two way radio to the computer's headphone and microphone connections, respectively.|$|R
50|$|Herbert G. Johnson, W6QKI, founded Swan Engineering. Johnson {{built the}} first ten largely vacuum tube type design single {{sideband}} (<b>SSB)</b> <b>transceivers</b> in a garage in Benson, Arizona, in 1960-1961. The more expensive Collins KWM-2 {{was the only other}} competing transceiver at the time. The operation moved to Oceanside, California, where, at one point, more than 400 radios per month were being manufactured, and some estimates say that more than 80,000 transceivers were sold during the company's lifetime.|$|R
50|$|It {{does not}} require {{stations}} to adopt the USB dial frequencies of 5354, 5357, 5360 and 5363 kHz but these frequencies provide a good fit with the American channel on 5357 kHz, and UK stations which can use 5354 and 5363 kHz (but not the middle two). Also, it is only by using these exact frequencies {{that there will be}} enough room for four simultaneous SSB conversations without mutual interference, assuming the 2.8 kHz de facto standard bandwidth of typical <b>SSB</b> <b>transceivers.</b>|$|R

25|$|A PSK31 {{operator}} typically uses a single-sideband (<b>SSB)</b> <b>transceiver</b> {{connected to}} the sound card of a computer running PSK31 software.

50|$|For Canadian and U.S Amateurs {{with perfect}} transmitters, the highest usable {{frequency}} in the 80m band for lower side band phone is 3.999 MHz. Depending on quality and condition of radio, audio characteristics, and proper adjustments {{the bulk of}} emissions on lower sideband will typically occupy 3.997-3.9997 MHz. All <b>SSB</b> <b>transceivers</b> have third and fifth order products of significant level, typically only 30-35 dB below PEP for third order intermodulation. This means any operation above 3.998 MHz LSB comes with some risk of illegal emissions, even with good equipment.|$|R

5000|$|Compression is used {{in voice}} {{communications}} in amateur radio that employ SSB modulation. Often {{it is used to}} make a particular station's signal more readable to a distant station, or to make one's station's transmitted signal stand out against others. This occurs especially in pileups where amateur radio stations are competing for the opportunity to talk to a DX station. Since an SSB signal's amplitude depends on the level of modulation, the net result is that the average amplitude of the signal and hence average transmitted power would be stronger than it would be had compression not been used. [...] Most modern amateur radio <b>SSB</b> <b>transceivers</b> have speech compressors built in.|$|R
50|$|EICO was {{established}} in New York City in 1945 by radio repair business owner Harry Ashley to manufacture electronic test equipment in kit form. His first product, advertised in the July 1946 Radio News, was the model 113 VTVM/audible signal tracer. A wide variety of test equipment remained the company's mainstay during {{the time it was}} in the electronics business, however EICO often augmented their product lines with what was thought fashionable. For example, in the late 1940s it offered Geiger counters in response to public interest in uranium prospecting. Sales by December 1956 were said to be over one million instruments. Their largest secondary market was audio equipment. EICO produced amateur radio equipment often in kit form, such as the EICO 720 and 730 transmitters. Later in the 1960s they made the EICO 753 <b>SSB</b> <b>transceiver</b> for amateur radio use. They also sold specialty test equipment for the ham radio market, including signal generators and grid dip oscillators.|$|R
50|$|Rather than {{produce a}} {{transmitter}} {{to match the}} 2B, Drake designed {{a new line of}} equipment beginning with an <b>SSB</b> <b>transceiver,</b> the TR-3, in 1963. Again emphasizing size efficiency, the TR-3 was designed as a complete SSB station in a small package. Other design innovations included crystal bandwidth filters and a permeability tuned oscillator (PTO) capable of extremely linear, stable tuning and a dial resolution of better than 1 kHz across all amateur HF (shortwave) bands. Its size was so small, in part, because the power supply was in a separate chassis, connected to the transceiver with a multi-conductor cable. The AC-3 power supply could be installed inside a matching speaker cabinet, later designated the MS-4. An optional remote VFO (PTO), the RV-3 could be added to the system to enable split frequency operation (i.e., transmitting on a frequency different from the receiving frequency). The RV-3 (and, later, the RV-4) also contained a speaker.|$|R
50|$|AO-6 had a 1.3 watt {{transmitter}} into a {{half-wave dipole}} antenna. AO-6's receiver input sensitivity was approximately -100dbm (2 uv per meter) {{and had an}} AGC that provided up to 26 dB of gain reduction optimized for <b>SSB</b> modulation. The <b>transceiver</b> team consisted of Karl Meinzer DJ4ZC, Wallace Mercer W4RUD, Dick Daniels WA4DGU and Jan King W3GEY.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{design of}} a {{radio-frequency}} transmitter that can operate in two bands while employing a minimal number of external components entails many challenges at both the architecture and the circuit levels. This paper describes the {{design of a}} 900 -MHz/ 1. 8 -GHz transmitter implemented in CMOS technology for dual-band applications. Configured as a two-step architecture, the circuit generates the first upconverted signal in quadrature form and subsequently performs single-sideband modulation to produce the output in two bands. Fabricated in a 0. 6 -&quot;m digital CMOS technology, the transmitter exhibits unwanted spurs 40 dB below the carrier while drawing 75 mW from a 3 -V supply.

5000|$|...Yaesu FT-7 is a rugged, {{solid state}} and modular built HF amateurband radio transceiver, {{suitable}} for fixed and for mobile operation. The set {{was built by}} the Yaesu Corporation in Japan in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Its first Japanese release was in 1976. This transceiver was very small for its time; by current modern standards however it is a large mobile set. It is a low-power (QRP) <b>SSB</b> and CW <b>transceiver</b> of which transmitting power is adjustable up from 10 to about 20W. The set is built up with pre-dated synthesisers and microprocessors, has an excellent receiver and a perfect dynamic range with good close-in noise performance which makes tuning across the noisy 80 or 40m bands at night very easy. All features, coupled to a price of $260- (in 1976) made sure that the [...] "Fox Tango 7" [...] as it was known became very popular in the HAM world.|$|R
