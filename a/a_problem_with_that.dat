2500|$|And here we are, {{someone who}} the CIA knows is a fraud, the U.S. Government knows is a fraud, {{is allowed to}} {{sit in front of}} the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and give {{testimony}} as an expert witness. I got <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> I got a problem with the American media, and I've told them {{over and over and over}} again that this man is a document-able fraud, a fake, and yet they allow him to go on CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, and testify as if he actually knows what he is talking about.|$|E
2500|$|Martin {{began by}} reiterating the government's main argument: that the scheme had been continuing, that dealers {{were able to}} resell the cars with altered odometers {{and went back to}} Schmuck for more and thus the title {{applications}} furthered his scheme. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked if the government had any evidence to support that claim; when Martin restated his argument another justice indicated he had <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> as well. [...] "he evidence would support a finding here that the existence of title laws which he could circumvent, {{figure out a way to}} get around, actually had a lulling effect," [...] he claimed.|$|E
2500|$|During Bucharest's annual GayFest in June 2007, Becali {{seemed to}} have {{tempered}} his homophobic stance. He declared {{in an interview that}} [...] "I love them [...] {{in the same way that}} I love all other people. They can marry at the City Hall, every day, 10 of them if they want to. But in church, they don't have a place." [...] When\ questioned about homosexuality in another interview conducted during the 2007 GayFest, he stated, [...] "They can do what they want... marry... I don't have anything against that". On the question of whether he would accept a gay person in the New Generation Party (Romania)New Generation Party of which he is president, Becali replied [...] "But why would I have <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>that?</b> Who knows how many there already are?" ...|$|E

2500|$|During a December 3, 2009 {{interview}} on Rusty Humphries' radio talk show, Humphries asked Sarah Palin {{if she would}} make Barack Obama's birth certificate a campaign issue in 2012, should she decide to run. Palin responded, [...] "I think the public rightfully is still making it an issue. I don't have <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> I don't know if I would have to bother {{to make it an}} issue, because I think that members of the electorate still want answers." [...] Humphries followed up, asking whether she thinks Obama's birth certificate is a fair question to be looking at. Palin answered, [...] "I think it's a fair question, just like I think past association and past voting records– all of that is fair game. The McCain–Palin campaign didn't do a good enough job in that area." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to Lakin officially violating {{his order}} to deploy, former Republican U.S. Senator Bob Smith, {{who founded the}} American Patriot Foundation, said: [...] "...my {{personal}} belief is that when an officer has a constitutional question I don't have <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> being answered, that's his legal right to have that answered, but I'm not involved in it." [...] Three retired United States generals expressed support for Lakin. [...] The first was retired Army Major General Paul E. Vallely, a senior military analyst for Fox News. [...] In an interview, Vallely stated [...] "I think many in the military – and many {{out of the military}} – question the natural-birth status of Barack Obama." [...] Following Vallely's announcement, retired Army Major General Jerry Curry and retired Air Force Lieutenant General (and Fox News analyst) Thomas McInerney also expressed public support for Lakin.|$|E
2500|$|Idol {{producer}} Nigel Lythgoe, who was unimpressed {{with the}} evidence presented on the Primetime Live special, called it [...] "shoddy journalism". [...] Regarding Clark's possession of Abdul's phone number, Lythgoe said, [...] "And I {{know for a fact}} that a lot of the contestants have got Paula's phone number and contact her and she contacts them. Paula's the den mother. ... I don't have <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> She's been a star and now she can help them and that's more than Simon [...]" [...] Lythgoe also addressed Clark's claim that he sent Abdul a secret message by singing [...] "I owe it all to you" [...] on the show by explaining that the serenade was choreographed by the producers. [...] Lythgoe also questioned why it took two years for Clark to reveal his alleged affair with Abdul, fueling speculation that Clark was merely attempting to gain publicity for his upcoming album.|$|E

[...] She also stated that the questions were 'fair play' because, [...] "the weird conspiracy theory freaky thing that people talk about that Trig isn't my real son– 'You need to produce his birth certificate, you need to prove that he's your kid,' which we have done.

50|$|When the {{war ended}} the {{interest}} in making fighter planes went down and SAAB needed something to use all the aluminum sheets they had stored.

Hence, the seemingly targetless syllables may represent grammatical morphemes.
