First, the <b>acoustical</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficients of porous concrete materials with various aggregate types, gradations, fibre contents, and compaction indexes are measured in the laboratory. The laboratory results show that porous concrete that uses a composite of expanded perlite and slag as aggregate can not only obtain good <b>acoustical</b> <b>absorption</b> properties but also satisfy mechanical requirements. Also, the gradation of the combined aggregate has {{a significant effect on}} the acoustic absorption performance of the porous concrete, with an optimal aggregate gradation of 1 ~ 3 [*]mm. Furthermore, the fibre content and compaction index affect both the strength and the acoustic absorption property of the porous concrete, with the optimum value of 0. 3 % and 1. 6, respectively. Then, the findings from the laboratory studies are used to make porous sound-absorbing concrete slabs, which are applied in a test section. The measurements indicate that porous sound-absorbing concrete slabs can significantly reduce railway noise at different train speeds and that the amount of the noise reduction changes roughly linearly with speed when the train is traveling at less than 200 [*]km/h.

Allard method took the elasticity of material into account and transfer matrices were able to characterize the whole structure as a combination of single layers. Results were close to experimental values and predicted the path and resonances very well. Further analyzes were conducted by Allard method and derived that having a fiber layer backed by an air gap was better than leaving the same gap in between that layer. The explanation was that, in the first arrangement, the sound field impacted a solid layer with higher thickness and followed a longer transmission path which caused a higher <b>acoustical</b> <b>absorption.</b> Furthermore, it was noticed that a reasonable thickness of backing air gap improved the overall sound absorption. Increase in the gap thickness produced more peaks and moved them to lower frequencies which caused better absorption in low frequencies. The cause of this phenomenon was increase in impedance of the panel due to rise in the air-gap thickness. This moved the acoustical resonances to lower frequencies and improved the sound absorption in this frequency span. Finally, {{it was concluded that}} other acoustic absorption techniques such as adding perforated plate may be combined with coir fiber-air gap structure to improve the low frequency acoustic absorption coefficient without any need to highly increase the air gap thickness.

The main goal was to illustrate how critical a choice of the <b>absorption</b> <b>factor</b> for simulations is and to indicate {{the importance of the}} possible modification of the absorption ability by using either active or lossy impurities. The spectra of A, T, and R are strongly sensitive to the location of the polaritonic gap with respect to the photonic pass and stop bands connected with periodicity that enables the efficient combination of the effects of material and structural parameters. It will be shown that the spectra can strongly depend on the utilized value of the material <b>absorption</b> <b>factor.</b> In particular, both narrow and wide absorption bands may appear owing to a variation of the material parameters with a frequency {{in the vicinity of the}} polaritonic gap. The latter are often achieved at wideband suppression of transmission, so that an ultra-wide stop band can appear as a result of adjustment of the stop bands having different origin. The results obtained at simultaneous variation of the <b>absorption</b> <b>factor</b> and frequency, and angle of incidence and frequency, indicate the possibility of the existence of wide ranges of tolerance, in which the basic features do remain. This allows for mitigating the accuracy requirements for the <b>absorption</b> <b>factor</b> in simulations and promises the efficient absorption of nonmonochromatic waves and beams with a wide angular spectrum. Suppression of narrowband effects in transmission is demonstrated at rather large values of the <b>absorption</b> <b>factor,</b> when they appear due to either the defect modes related to structural defects or dispersion inspired variations of the material parameters in the vicinity of the polaritonic gap.

40|$|The {{selection}} pressure from echolocating bats has driven {{the development of}} a diverse range of anti-bat strategies in insects. For instance, several studies have proposed that the wings of some moths absorb {{a large portion of the}} sound energy contained in a bat's ultrasonic cry; as a result, the bat receives a dampened echo, and the moth becomes invisible to the bat. To test the hypothesis that greater exposure to bat predation drives the development of higher ultrasound absorbance, we used a small reverberation chamber to measure the ultrasound absorbance of the wings of nocturnal (Bombycoidea: Saturniidae) and diurnal moths (Chalcosiinae: Zygaenoidea: Zygaenidae). The <b>absorption</b> <b>factor</b> of the nocturnal saturniids peaks significantly higher than the <b>absorption</b> <b>factor</b> of the diurnal chalcosiines.

A strategically sculpted elastomer topology is geometrically constrained and embedded in a poroelastic matrix to realize the metamaterial platform. Finite element model analyses guide design of the embedded hyperdamping inclusions while experimental studies on dynamic force transmissibility and <b>acoustical</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficient provide conclusive evidence that hyperdamping phenomena facilitate wideband energy dissipation in a lightweight material system that is not subject to the limitations of conventional resonance- or bandgap-based attenuation effects.

30|$|By {{investigating}} <b>absorption</b> {{and transmission}} <b>factor</b> for TM and TE waves, another research {{revealed that the}} conversion of evanescent waves into propagating waves in FSL results from excitation of SPPs supported by the metallic grating. Incident TM waves scattered at the exit surface excite SPP modes, giving rise to large <b>absorption</b> <b>factor</b> [74]. Meanwhile, {{it was announced that}} SPPs play a negative role in p[*]=[*] 0 transmission [81]. From these two facts, evanescent waves in the negative diffraction order are strongly transmitted compared to propagating waves in the order 0, enabling sub-diffraction imaging.|$|R

It {{is the first}} time that the K shell <b>absorption</b> jump <b>factor</b> and jump ratio have been discussed for present elements using two different methods. To detect K X-rays, a high resolution Si(Li) detector was used. The experimental results of K shell <b>absorption</b> jump <b>factors</b> and jump ratios were compared with the theoretically calculated ones.
