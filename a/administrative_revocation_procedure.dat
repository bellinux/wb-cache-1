50|$|The new Articles 105a, 105b and 105c EPC (of the EPC 2000) {{form the}} legal {{basis of the}} {{limitation}} and <b>revocation</b> <b>procedures.</b> These procedures are applicable since 13 December 2007 to all European patents, whether already granted or granted after that date.|$|R
50|$|The European patent can be revoked {{under the}} laws of a Contracting State on certain grounds (specified in EPC Articles 138 and 139) with effect only in that State. A central time-limited {{opposition}} procedure and central limitation and <b>revocation</b> <b>procedures</b> before the EPO are available however. The opposition procedure allows a third party, i.e. any person except the patent proprietor, to oppose a granted European patent {{in an attempt to}} have the EPO reconsider the grant of the patent and possibly revoke or amend the patent. The opposition procedure may only be initiated within nine months of the grant of the European patent. The limitation and <b>revocation</b> <b>procedures</b> allow the patent proprietor to centrally request the limitation or revocation of his own European patent.|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the unified character of a European patent application, a granted European patent has, in effect, no unitary character, except for the centralized opposition procedure (which can be initiated within 9 months from grant, by somebody else than the patent proprietor), and the centralized limitation and <b>revocation</b> <b>procedures</b> (which can only be instituted by the patent proprietor). In other words, a European patent in one Contracting State, i.e. a [...] "national" [...] European patent, is effectively independent of the same European patent in each other Contracting State, except for the opposition, limitation and <b>revocation</b> <b>procedures.</b> The enforcement of a European patent is dealt with by national law. The abandonment, revocation or limitation of the European patent in one state {{does not affect the}} European patent in other states.|$|R

50|$|In European patent law, the {{limitation}} and <b>revocation</b> <b>procedures</b> before the European Patent Office (EPO) are post-grant, ex parte, administrative procedures allowing any European patent to be centrally limited by an amendment {{of the claims}} or revoked, respectively. These two procedures were introduced in the recently revised text of the European Patent Convention (EPC), i.e. the so-called EPC 2000, which entered into force on 13 December 2007.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} presents these broad {{policy areas}} involving the growing population of older drivers and offers specific policy {{recommendations to the}} Wisconsin Department of Transportation, Safety Division. Through research and conversations with transportation professionals, we narrowed {{the focus of this}} analysis to three primary issues: 1) Transportation System Design Standards and Practices, primarily focused on driving issues, 2) Alternative Licensing Practices, targeted specifically to renewal or <b>revocation</b> <b>procedures,</b> and 3) Alternative Transportation Opportunities on a local scale. Each is presented as a brief chapter. ...|$|R
50|$|Almost all {{attributes}} of a European patent in a Contracting State, i.e. ownership, validity, and infringement, are determined independently under respective national law, {{except for the}} opposition procedure, limitation <b>procedure,</b> and <b>revocation</b> <b>procedure</b> as discussed above. Though the EPC imposes some common limits, the EPC expressly adopts national law for interpretation of all substantive {{attributes of}} a European patent in a Contracting State, with a few exceptions. Thus, almost all post-grant proceedings - including renewal, revocation proceedings (when initiated by somebody else than the proprietor), and infringement enforcement are determined under national law.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper proposes hybrid voting {{systems as}} a {{solution}} for the vote buying and voter coercion problem of electronic voting systems. The key idea is to allow voters to revoke and overrule their electronic votes at the polling station. We analyze the potential and pitfalls of such <b>revocation</b> <b>procedures</b> and give concrete recommendations on {{how to build a}} hybrid system offering coercion-resistance based on this feature. Our solution may be of interest to governments, which aim at integrating paper-based and electronic voting systems rather than replacing the former by the latter. ...|$|R
50|$|All probationers in the United States who incur a {{violation}} or multiple violations are guaranteed certain hearings before any permanent, punitive action is taken. A Gagnon I hearing {{occurs when a}} probationer is taken into custody for an alleged violation hearing; this first hearing determines if the probation should remain in custody or be released back into the community. A Gagnon II hearing is the final <b>revocation</b> <b>procedure.</b> A determination {{on the status of}} the probation is made, and if the probationer is found in violation, a sentence (resentence) for the original criminal charge is handed down by the Judge.|$|R
50|$|Patents granted {{under the}} European Patent Convention (EPC) are called European patents. Those are granted {{following}} a unified grant procedure {{based on a}} single patent application, in one language. After grant however, a European patent is not a unitary right, but becomes a bundle of essentially independent nationally-enforceable, nationally-revocable patents -subject to central revocation or narrowing as a group pursuant to two types of unified, post-grant procedures: a time-limited opposition procedure, which can be initiated by any person except the patent proprietor, and limitation and <b>revocation</b> <b>procedures,</b> which can be initiated by the patent proprietor only.|$|R
5000|$|General Parole <b>Revocation</b> <b>Procedures.</b> This measure {{changed the}} board's parole <b>revocation</b> <b>procedures</b> for {{offenders}} {{after they have}} been paroled from prison. Under a federal court order in a case known as Valdivia v. Schwarzenegger, parolees were previously entitled to a hearing within 10 business days after being charged with violation of their parole to determine if there was probable cause to detain them until their revocation charges were resolved. The measure extended the deadline for this hearing to 15 days. The prior order also required that parolees arrested for parole violations have a hearing to resolve the revocation charges within 35 days. This measure extended this timeline to 45 days. It also provides for the appointment of legal counsel to parolees facing revocation charges only if the board determines, on a case-by-case basis, that the parolee is indigent because of the complexity of the matter or because of the parolee's mental or educational incapacity, the parolee appears incapable of speaking effectively in his or her defense. Because this measure does not provide for counsel at all parole revocation hearings, and because the measure does not provide counsel for parolees who are not indigent, a federal judge held it was in conflict with the Valdivia court order, which requires that all parolees be provided legal counsel. However, in March 2010, the Federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the lower court ruling and directed it to reconcile its ruling with Proposition 9.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we propose a {{solution}} to enable an accurate terminal revocation in the Extended Access Control (EAC). Chaabouni and Vaudenay in [CV 09] pointed out the need for an accurate <b>revocation</b> <b>procedure,</b> but failed to provide a complete solution description. We aim at filling this gap. Our solution relies on augmenting terminal authentication with a t-out-of-ℓ threshold signature provided by neighboring terminals. These terminals will be in charge of checking the revocation status of the requested terminal. As Terminals have a real clock embedded and more computational power than Machine Readable Travel Documents (MRTDs), they are better suited for checking revocation status. ...|$|R

25|$|According to {{information}} {{obtained from the}} Israeli Department of Defense, Israel revoked the residency status of more than 100,000 residents of the Gaza Strip and of around 140,000 residents of the West Bank during the 27 years between Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967 {{and the establishment of}} the Palestinian Authority in 1994. Working in secret, the Israeli government revoked the residency status of Palestinians who studied or lived abroad for longer than a period of time and the revocations have barred nearly {{a quarter of a million}} Palestinians and their descendants from returning to Israel/Palestine. Israel is now employing a similar residency right <b>revocation</b> <b>procedure</b> for Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem.|$|R
40|$|Anonymity {{services}} in the EU may be forced by the new EU data retention directive to collect connection data and deanonymise some of their users in case of serious crimes. For this purpose, we propose a new privacy-friendly solution for incorporating revocation in an anonymous communication system. In contrast to other known methods, our scheme does not reveal {{the identity of a}} user to any other entity involved in the <b>revocation</b> <b>procedure</b> but the law enforcement agency. Another advantage is, that no user will need to provide more identifying information than his connection (IP) address, that is what he needs to communicate with the system anyway. The proposed scheme is based mainly on threshold group signatures and threshold atomic proxy re-encryption...|$|R
40|$|If {{there are}} many {{displaced}} workers in a company, then a person who goes for job hunting might not select this company. That is, the number of members who quit is quite negative information. Similarly, in revocable group signature schemes, if one knows (or guesses) the number of revoked users (say r), then one may guess the reason behind such circumstances, and it may lead to harmful rumors. However, no previous <b>revocation</b> <b>procedure</b> can achieve hiding r. In this paper, we propose the first revocable group signature scheme, where r is kept hidden, which we call r-hiding revocable group signature. To handle this property, we newly define the security notion called anonymity {{with respect to the}} revocation which guarantees the unlinkability of revoked users...|$|R
50|$|The European Patent Convention (EPC), {{also known}} as the Convention on the Grant of European Patents of 5 October 1973, is a {{multilateral}} treaty instituting the European Patent Organisation and providing an autonomous legal system according to which European patents are granted. The term European patent is used to refer to patents granted under the European Patent Convention. However, a European patent is not a unitary right, but a group of essentially independent nationally-enforceable, nationally-revocable patents, subject to central revocation or narrowing as a group pursuant to two types of unified, post-grant procedures: a time-limited opposition procedure, which can be initiated by any person except the patent proprietor, and limitation and <b>revocation</b> <b>procedures,</b> which can be initiated by the patent proprietor only.|$|R
50|$|There {{are only}} two types of {{centrally}} executed procedures after grant, the opposition procedure and the limitation and <b>revocation</b> <b>procedures.</b> The opposition procedure, governed by the EPC, allows third parties to file an opposition against a European patent within 9 months of the date of grant of that patent. It is a quasi-judicial process, subject to appeal, {{which can lead to}} maintenance, maintenance in amended form or revocation of a European patent. Simultaneously to the opposition, a European patent may be the subject of litigation at a national level (for example an infringement dispute). National courts may suspend such infringement proceedings pending outcome of the opposition proceedings to avoid proceedings running in parallel and the uncertainties that may arise from that.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Group {{signature}} schemes allow a {{group member}} to sign messages anonymously {{on behalf of}} the group. During last decade, group signature schemes have been intensively investigated in the literature and applied to various applications. Especially, as noted in [3], the complexity of member deletion stands in the way of real world applications of group signatures. In this paper, we propose a group signature scheme with an efficient member <b>revocation</b> <b>procedure.</b> The proposed scheme is based on the scheme [18], which was turned out to be flawed [21]. We modify the scheme in [18] so as to obtain secure and efficient member revocation and unlinkability of signatures. Our revocation method is an improvement over the work of Camenisch and Lysyanskaya [9], which is known to be the most efficient scheme so far. ...|$|R

It also would examine if revocation has a legal basis, as well as real cases to provide the impact of this principle in administrative law...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Signcryption is a {{cryptographic}} primitive {{which offers}} authentication and confidentiality simultaneously with a cost lower than signing and encrypting the message independently. Ring signcryption enables a user to signcrypt a message {{along with the}} identities {{of a set of}} potential senders (that includes him) without revealing which user in the set has actually produced the signcryption. Thus a ring signcrypted message has anonymity in addition to authentication and confidentiality. Ring signcryption schemes have no group managers, no setup <b>procedures,</b> no <b>revocation</b> <b>procedures</b> and no coordination: any user can choose any set of users (ring), that includes himself and signcrypt any message by using his private and public key as well as other users (in the ring) public keys, without getting any approval or assistance from them. Ring Signcryption is useful for leaking trustworthy secrets in an anonymous, authenticated and confidential way. To the best of our knowledge, seven identity based ring signcryptio...|$|R
50|$|In {{the state}} of Texas, <b>Administrative</b> License <b>Revocation</b> is a process by which an {{individual}} who is arrested for Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) {{has his or her}} driver's license administratively suspended. This program went into effect on January 1, 1995, and is administrated by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS). DPS records indicate that 103,168 notices of suspension were served during calendar year 2003. During that time period the agency processed 95,495 suspensions.|$|R
5000|$|License {{suspension}} or revocation traditionally follows {{conviction for}} alcohol-impaired or drunk driving. However, under administrative license suspension (ALS) laws, sometimes called <b>administrative</b> license <b>revocation</b> or <b>administrative</b> per se, licenses are confiscated and automatically suspended independent of criminal proceedings whenever a driver either (1) refuses {{to submit to}} chemical testing (blood, breath or, in some states, urine), or (2) submits to testing with results indicating a blood alcohol content of 0.08% or higher.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} courts have shown more {{recognition}} {{of the rights of}} parolees and probationers. Spurred by a Supreme Court decision that certain due process protections were applicable to parole <b>revocation</b> <b>procedures,</b> <b>revocation</b> hearings are now providing parolees and probationers some of the procedural protections available to criminal defendants at trial. Policy considerations have dictated, however, that the protections available at revocation hearings must fall far short of conferring upon the accused 2 ̆ 2 the full panoply of rights due a defendant 2 ̆ 2 at trial. As a result of the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s emphasis on the difference between revocation hearings and criminal proceedings, lower courts have held that some constitutional protections available to defendants at trial do not apply at revocation hearings. Thus, the exclusionary rule has been held inapplicable to revocation hearings. This is in contrast to a recent district court decision, Standlee v. Rhay, where it was held that because of the punitive nature of a revocation hearing, it should be treated in some respects as equivalent to a criminal proceeding. These contrasting results are not as inconsistent as they may seem at first glance, but may be harmonized, to some extent, through an analysis of the principles underlying the respective doctrines. Although revocation hearings often present both exclusionary rule and collateral estoppel problems, these are essentially distinct legal concepts...|$|R

Using difference-in-differences estimators of U.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the sensitivity of}} policy conclusions that are derived from crash models using various specifications. Our analyses compare models specified as crash rate or population normalized models (i. e., fatalities per capita or per vehicle miles traveled) adjusted to account for serial correlation in the error term with negative binomial count models with {{the total number of}} fatalities as the dependent variable. Our analyses focus on the interpretation of key policy variables, especially the association between safety-belt laws and <b>administrative</b> license <b>revocation</b> laws on fatalities. Evaluation of statistical significance of parameters, elasticities derived from the models and total fatalities associated with changes in key variables are examined. Results suggest that negative binomial models tend to be more robust and display less variation in results than those linear regression models that account for serial correlation. From a policy perspective, we found no evidence that passage of <b>administrative</b> license <b>revocation</b> laws that automatically suspend the license of a drunk driver have been effective while laws requiring safety-belt usage have been effective. Our results suggest that providing confidence intervals on elasticity estimates and estimated fatalities would provide policy makers with greater confidence in the results of model estimates.

40|$|The authors {{compared}} US {{motor vehicle}} and motorcycle mortality rates during periods when each of several alcohol-related laws were in effect with mortality rates during other periods. During the period 1980 – 1997, there were 792, 184 deaths due to motor vehicle crashes and 63, 052 deaths due to motorcycle crashes. An estimated 26 % and 49 % of these fatalities, respectively, were attributable to alcohol use. The incidence of alcohol-related mortality in motor vehicle crashes was lower when laws specifying a {{blood alcohol concentration}} of 0. 08 g/dl per se (laws stating {{that it is a}} criminal offense to drive with a blood alcohol concentration above the state’s legal limit) were in effect (adjusted rate ratio (RR) = 0. 86, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 83, 0. 88). For motorcycle deaths, the adjusted rate ratio was 0. 87 (95 % CI: 0. 79, 0. 95). The incidence of alcohol-related mortality in motor vehicle crashes was also lower during periods when two other types of laws were in effect: zero tolerance laws (adjusted RR = 0. 88, 95 % CI: 0. 86, 0. 90) and <b>administrative</b> license <b>revocation</b> laws (adjusted RR = 0. 95, 95 % CI: 0. 93, 0. 98).

40|$|Citizenship {{provides}} benefits, guarantees, and {{protections of}} great value and emotional significance. The vast importance of citizenship {{has been referred to}} as the very “right to have rights. ” The law creates a complex framework for how one becomes a citizen, proves citizenship, and potentially loses citizenship. This Note focuses on three documents purporting to establish proof of citizenship: the passport, the certificate of citizenship, and the certificate of naturalization. These three documents {{are at the center of}} 22 U. S. C. § 2705, a foundational proof of citizenship statute. Courts are split on whether § 2705 allows a person to conclusively prove citizenship with a passport. The Fifth, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits have interpreted § 2705 to designate a passport as conclusive proof of citizenship; the Third Circuit, however, held that § 2705 designates a passport as conclusive proof of citizenship only if the passport had been issued to a U. S. citizen. This Note argues that § 2705 unambiguously denotes a passport as conclusive proof of citizenship. Nevertheless, this Note also argues that this area is ripe for legislative change based on an ineffective <b>revocation</b> <b>procedure,</b> differing levels of scrutiny, and the potential for conflict created by the three documents...|$|R
