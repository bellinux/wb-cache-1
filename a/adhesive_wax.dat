60|$|The next morning, early, Dick and Surajah {{set to work}} {{to perfect}} their disguises. They had, before, {{appeared}} simply as two young traders, well to do, and of a class above the ordinary peddling merchant. They now fitted on the ample beards {{that had been made}} at Tripataly. These were attached so firmly to their faces, by an <b>adhesive</b> <b>wax,</b> that they could not be pulled off without the use of a good deal of force. With the same stuff, small patches of hair were fastened on, so as to hide the edge of the foundation of the beard. Tufts of short grey hair were attached to their eyebrows; a few grey lines were carefully drawn {{at the corner of the}} eyes, and across the foreheads; and when this was done, they felt assured that no one was likely to suspect the disguise.|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} simple, {{low-cost}} and detachable microfluidic chip incorporating easily accessible paper, glass slides or other polymer films as the chip materials along with <b>adhesive</b> <b>wax</b> as the recycling bonding material. We use a laser {{to cut through}} the paper or film to form patterns and then sandwich the paper and film between glass sheets or polymer membranes. The hot-melt <b>adhesive</b> <b>wax</b> can realize bridge bonding between various materials, for example, paper, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) film, glass sheets, or metal plate. The bonding process is reversible and the wax is reusable through a melting and cooling process. With this process, a three-dimensional (3 D) microfluidic chip is achievable by vacuating and venting the chip in a hot-water bath. To study the biocompatibility and applicability of the wax-based microfluidic chip, we tested the PCR compatibility with the chip materials first. Then we applied the wax-paper based microfluidic chip to HeLa cell electroporation (EP). Subsequently, a prototype of a 5 -layer 3 D chip was fabricated by multilayer wax bonding.

40|$|In {{this body}} of work we have been {{developing}} and characterizing paper based microfluidic fabrication technologies to produce low cost biological analysis. Specifically we investigated the performance of paper microfluidics that had been bonded using wax or acrylic glue, and characterized the affect {{of these and other}} microfluidic materials on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We report a simple, low-cost and detachable microfluidic chip incorporating easily accessible paper, glass slides or other polymer films as the chip materials along with <b>adhesive</b> <b>wax</b> or cyanoacrylate-based resin as the recycling bonding material. We use a laser to cut through the paper or film to form patterns and then sandwich the paper and film between glass sheets or polymer membranes. The hot-melt <b>adhesive</b> <b>wax</b> or simple cyanoacrylate-based resin can realize bridge bonding between various materials, for example, paper, polymethylmethacrylate film, glass sheets, or metal plate. The wax bonding process is reversible and the wax is reusable through a melting and cooling process. With this process, a three-dimensional (3 D) microfluidic chip is achievable by evacuating the channels of adhesive material in a hot-water. We applied the wax-paper based microfluidic chip to HeLa cell electroporation. Subsequently, a prototype of a 5 -layer 3 D chip was fabricated by multilayer wax bonding. To check the sealing ability and the durability of the chip, green fluorescence protein recombinant E. coli bacteria were cultured, with which the chemotaxis of E. coli was studied {{in order to determine the}} influence of antibiotic ciprofloxacin concentration on the E. coli migration. The chip bonded with cyanoacrylate-based resin was tested by measuring protein concentration and carrying out DNA capillary electrophoresis. To study the biocompatibility and applicability of our microfluidic chip fabrication technology, we tested the PCR compatibility of our chip materials along with various other common materials employed in the fabrication of microfluidic chips including: silicon, several kinds of silicon oxide, glasses, plastics, wax, and adhesives, etc. Two-temperature PCR was performed with these materials to determine their PCR-inhibitory effect. In most of the cases, addition of bovine serum albumin effectively improved the reaction yield. We also studied the individual PCR components from the standpoint of adsorption. Most of the materials did not inhibit the DNA, whereas they did show noticeable interaction with the DNA polymerase. This work provides a simple low cost fabrication method for creating microfluidic devices for biological analysis. Example assays were undertaken and the biocompatibility of our technology was studied, both of which demonstrated the utility of our approach...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{effect of}} apical Patency on apical seal is very {{important}} in canal preparation. The effect of apical Patency on seal of this area was evaluated in this study. Methods and Materials: In this experimental in vitro study, 90 single rooted mature intact human teeth were cut at CEJ and were divided in two test groups with 40 each and two control groups with 5 each. Canal preparation was done by step back technique; without Patency file in group 1 and with Patency file in group 2. Then the canals were obturated by lateral condensation. No instrumentation or obturation was done on control groups. The root surfaces of two test groups and positive control group were covered with one layer of <b>adhesive</b> <b>wax</b> and two layers of nail varnish except for apical 2 mm. Then they were placed in black ink at 37 ºc in an incubator for 5 days. Thereafter the roots were split into halves and leakage of dye was measured by a stereomicroscope. The data was analyzed by t-student test. Results: Mean dye penetration was 10 : 125 mm in group 1 and 6, 3 mm in group 2. This difference was statistic-cally significant. Conclusion: Apical seal could be increased with the maintenance of apical Patency during canal preparation...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess whether}} palatal mini-implants are {{effective}} as direct anchorage for distal {{movement of the}} upper molars. METHODS: It was used an acrylic model of the upper dental arch. After making a groove in the region corresponding to dental alveolus, acrylic teeth were fixed in groove with # 7 wax, with the roots being previously immersed in <b>adhesive</b> <b>wax.</b> The orthodontic appliance was placed according to the Edgewise technique and then a mini-implant (SIN, São Paulo, Brazil) was inserted at the site corresponding to the palatal raphe. A 0. 019 x 0. 025 -in stainless steel archwire was made and attached to the upper arch with elastics. A transpalatal arch bar (0. 019 x 0. 025 in) was mounted and two hooks were soldered to {{it in order to}} retain chain elastics (Unitek, Brazil) to be connected to the mini-implant under a force of 1. 5 N on each side. The maxillary model was immersed in water 40 times and photographed after each immersion, for observation of dental movements. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's test were employed for analyzing the obtained data. RESULTS: Molars displaced distally 3. 1 mm, in average, with distal inclination ranging from 3 to 5 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Molar movements occurred due to distal inclination, with a slight rotation and no extrusive effect...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to develop a {{procedure}} {{for the analysis of}} trace concentration of phthalate esters (PEA) in coffee brew stored in plastic cups. Phthalates are esters of phthalic acid, generally have high boiling points, lowvolatility are insoluble in water andpredominantly fat-soluble. Phthalates with higher molecular weights, such as bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) are largely used as additives and plasticizers in plastic material (PVC), while those with lower molecular weights are components of solvents, <b>adhesive,</b> <b>wax,</b> ink, pharmaceutical products, insecticide materials and cosmetic. Dimethyl phthalate and diethyl phthalate are present in plastics based on cellulose esters such as cellulose acetate and butyrate. The widespread use of these products resulted in their presence in various environmental matrices such as water, soil and food. Phthalate esters have endocrine disrupting properties. Several studies have shown that phthalate esters are estrogenic and have reproductive effects in mammals. Considering that the potential health impact on humans, the European Commission, for example, is proposing a ban on the use of phthalate esters in soft PVC materials for making baby toys. In the present work, considering the large daily consumption of coffee, we optimized a reliable analytical methodand investigated the levels, distribution of 17 analyte incoffee brew samples. This method is based on liquid–liquid extraction of brew; the determination is carried out by GC– MS using SIM acquisition data. The method is more selective, rapid and economical than those described in the literature for similar matrices, which are based on SPE. The method detection limits for the 17 phthalate esters were between 10 µg l− 1 and 90 µg l− 1 and recovery rates between 65...|$|E
40|$|Here we {{demonstrate}} {{the use of}} microstereolithography (MSL), a 3 D direct manufacturing technique, as a viable method to produce small-scale microfluidic components for electrochemical flow detection. The flow cell is assembled simply by resting the microfabricated component on the electrode of interest and securing with thread! This configuration allows {{the use of a}} wide range of electrode materials. Furthermore, our approach eliminates the need for additional sealing methods, such as <b>adhesives,</b> <b>waxes,</b> and screws, which have previously been deployed. In addition, it removes any issues associated with compression of the cell chamber. MSL allows a reduction of the dimensions of the channel geometry (and the resultant component) and, compared to most previously produced devices, it offers a high degree of flexibility in the design, reduced manufacture time, and high reliability. Importantly, the polymer utilized does not distort so that the cell maintains well-defined geometrical dimensions after assembly. For the studies herein the channel dimensions were 3 mm wide, 3. 5 mm long, and 192 or 250 ?m high. The channel flow cell dimensions were chosen to ensure that the substrate electrodes experienced laminar flow conditions, even with volume flow rates of up to 64 mL min? 1 (the limit of our pumping system). The steady-state transport-limited current response, for the oxidation of ferrocenylmethyl trimethylammonium hexaflorophosphate (FcTMA+), at gold and polycrystalline boron doped diamond (pBDD) band electrodes was in agreement with the Levich equation and/or finite element simulations of mass transport. We believe that this method of creating and using channel flow electrodes offers a wide range of new applications from electroanalysis to electrocatalysis...|$|R

40|$|DE 102006013517 A 1 UPAB: 20071108 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} {{providing a}} carrier (5) with a surface electrode (12), and arranging a substrate (15) e. g. paper foil, between the electrode and another surface electrode (20). Voltage is applied between the electrodes such that polarizable molecules of the substrate are polarized, and the substrate is {{fixed to the}} carrier. The electrode (20) is flexible and is removed by peeling such that a pull off force works along a line, where the substrate remains fixed at the carrier. An insulation layer (11) is arranged between the substrate and the electrode (12) and/or the electrode (20). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a device for treating a substrate, which has polarizable molecules. USE - Used for treating a substrate such as plastic foil, paper foil or metal foil, which is utilized {{for the production of}} an electronic system, flexible display, flexible solar cell and flexible light surface. ADVANTAGE - The insulating layer improves retention force and prevents an electrical intersection, thus offering the substrate with high retention force with good laminar surface pressure. The carrier ensures a very even contact between the substrate and a mother board. The method facilitates fixing and detaching of the substrates to be performed in a very fast, simple, automated and problem-free manner. The method eliminates additional sticking processes, and avoids contamination with chemicals or solvents from <b>adhesives</b> or <b>wax,</b> thus avoiding cleaning after the removal of the substrate from the carrier...|$|R
