5|$|Taking {{refuge from}} another angry mob in a crypt, the Monster spies Pretorius <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cronies</b> Karl (Dwight Frye) and Ludwig (Ted Billings) {{breaking}} open a grave. The henchmen depart as Pretorius stays {{to enjoy a}} light supper. The Monster approaches Pretorius, and learns that Pretorius plans to create a mate for him.|$|E
25|$|A {{day before}} the race, Ilderim prepares his horses. Judah {{appoints}} Malluch to organize his support campaign for him. Meanwhile, Messala organizes his own huge campaign, revealing Judah Ben-Hur's former identity to the community as an outcast and convict. Malluch challenges Messala <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cronies</b> to a large wager, which, if the Roman loses, would bankrupt him.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} as acting president, Burnet {{dismissed}} several of Lamar's appointees, angering the president. At the conclusion of Lamar's term, Burnet agreed to run for president. Lamar <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cronies</b> only reluctantly supported Burnet after they could not entice Rusk to run. Burnet's primary competition was Houston, and the campaign was dominated by insults and namecalling. Houston questioned Burnet's honesty, accusing him of taking a $250,000 bribe from Santa Anna and calling him a 'political brawler' and a 'canting hypocrite.' Houston also accused Burnet of being a drunk. Burnet again challenged Houston to a duel, and, again, Houston refused. Houston won the election, with 7,915votes to Burnet's 3,619.|$|E
60|$|Ham paid no {{attention}} to the last words. He <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>crony</b> were looking at Tommy. Now they whispered together.|$|R
6000|$|... "I rather guess I know," [...] {{answered}} Pepper, {{and looked}} around for Ritter and Coulter, but the bully <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>crony</b> had disappeared.|$|R

500|$|Noman spoke over Radio San'a, {{offering}} {{reconciliation and}} inviting [...] "all tribes of all persuasions" [...] {{to meet with}} him the following week at Khamir, 50 miles north of San'a, to achieve [...] "the one thing which we all prize over anything else: peace for the nation." [...] In order to convince al-Badr to come the conference, Noman announced that he personally would head the republican delegation at Khamir, and that Sallal would stay in San'a. Al-Badr and his ranking chiefs did not attend the conference, but a handful of pro-royalist sheiks were present. The conference named a committee of five tribal and four religious leaders who were charged with seeking out the [...] "beguiled brothers", al-Badr and his friends. Noman's effort, including a private promise to reach a withdrawal of Egyptian troops, was backed by Nasser. Radio Cairo hailed the Khamir conference as the [...] "dawn of a new era." [...] Sallal called the talks [...] "a complete success", while al-Badr stated that [...] "It is essential that the conflict which has devastated our beloved country be brought to an end by peaceful negotiations between the Yemeni people themselves." [...] However, by early June, when Noman said that Egypt's 50,000 troops would have {{to be replaced by a}} joint royalist-republican [...] peace force, the Nasserites lost interest in the deal. After Noman flew to Cairo to protest directly to Nasser, Sallal threw seven civilian [...] Cabinet ministers into jail. Noman resigned, saying [...] "It is obvious that Sallal <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cronies</b> are more interested in war than [...] peace". Sallal soon named a new Cabinet to replace Noman's, with 13 military men and two civilians.|$|E
500|$|... "Irresistible" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly rated [...] "Irresistible" [...] a B+, {{saying it was}} based on [...] "an unsettling concept to begin with" [...] that was reinforced by [...] "Chinlund's skin-crawling one-man show". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club rated the episode A, praising the acting, particularly of Chinlund as Pfaster, and describing it as [...] "legitimately scary, a sign of a show that was pushing itself in new and interesting directions". The only criticism was for the scenes where Scully hallucinates Pfaster shapeshifting as [...] "pretty silly, almost feeling like an attempt to make sure something vaguely paranormal is in the episode so the fans don't get bored with what is ultimately a very good episode". Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode a B+ grade. Writing for Den of Geek, Nina Sordi ranked [...] "Irresistible" [...] the sixth best X-Files episode, saying that [...] "excluding CSM <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cronies,</b> Pfaster has got to be the most disturbing villain that our favorite agents have encountered". Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named it the [...] "finest" [...] stand-alone episode of the second season, describing it as [...] "a genuinely creepy 45-minute horror movie". Connie Ogle of Popmatters listed Pfaster among the best monster-of-the-week characters of the series, and IGN's Christine Seghers ranked Chinlund the seventh best guest star {{in the history of the}} show, considering that [...] "what makes him all the more frightening is how downright passive and polite he is up until the moment he's going to kill; the perfect camouflage for a modern-day monster." [...] TV Guide listed Pfaster among the [...] scariest X-Files monsters describing him as [...] "evil incarnate".|$|E
2500|$|Adams' [...] "White to Play and Win" [...] thesis {{was widely}} ridiculed. Larry Evans wrote that [...] "Mr. Adams <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cronies</b> {{may be linked}} to the radical right wing of chess. ... Weaver is not content with such halfway {{measures}} as equality. All or nothing—right-wing logic, true to form." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What's {{the meaning}} of this?" [...] spluttered Nat Poole, when he found himself <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>crony</b> in {{dormitory}} No. 12, and with the door closed and locked.|$|R
60|$|A {{portion of}} the {{provisions}} was left at the camp and then Ham Spink <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>crony</b> crossed the lake, while Jed Sanborn remained with Snap and the others.|$|R
2500|$|Hazlitt never mellowed in his {{attitude}} toward Gifford {{as he did}} toward his [...] "apostate" [...] former friends, {{but as a result}} he created a sketch that has come to be recognized as a [...] "masterpiece of invective". Some have thought of Hazlitt as merely [...] "getting even" [...] in this essay. But, increasingly, his treatment of Gifford has come to be seen as understandable as it is accurate, in view of the savage nature of the politically motivated criticism of that age as well as the damage inflicted by Gifford <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cronies</b> on Hazlitt and other liberal-minded literary figures. To the critic Walter Jackson Bate, who named the attack on Gifford in the Letter to William Gifford as [...] "one of the half-dozen most sustained pieces of invective in English", the sketch of Gifford in The Spirit of the Age is [...] "even more effective".|$|E
2500|$|The L.A. Times {{announced}} {{the winners of}} its in-house editorial awards May 2011. The paper's Pulitzer Prize-winning Bell coverage won in the [...] "investigations" [...] category {{as well as the}} Publisher's Prize. The Times publisher Eddie Hartenstein said of his paper's Bell coverage: [...] "Robert Rizzo <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cronies,</b> I think, savored their windfall and knew all too well what they were doing and knew they had to keep it secret. And if anyone was bold enough to uncover it, it was some of our folks here. They went to ask the city clerks at Bell, Calif., and the response they got repeatedly was 'Those records aren't available; come back in two weeks.' But they wouldn't accept that ... hen [...] finally came off the Bell salary scandal, it was not because of a grand jury or a conscience-stricken official or anything like that. It was because of two intrepid L.A. Times reporters." ...|$|E
2500|$|BBC {{diplomatic}} correspondent Bridget Kendall in her 2007 article, after {{describing the}} [...] "scarred decade" [...] of the 1990s with [...] "rampant hyperinflation", harsh Yeltsin's policies, population decrease rate {{like that for}} a nation in a war, the country turning [...] "from superpower into beggar", wonders: [...] "So who can blame Russians for welcoming the relative stability Putin has presided over during the past seven years, even if other aspects of his rule have cast an authoritarian shadow? In the back-to-front world of Russian politics, it is not too little democracy that many people fear, but too much of it. This, I discovered, is why some are calling for Putin to stay on for a third term. Not because they admire him—privately, many say that he <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cronies</b> are just as corrupt and disdainful of others as their communist predecessors were—but because they mistrust the idea of democracy, resent the West for pushing it, and fear what might happen as a result of next year's elections. Recent experience has taught them that change is usually for the worse and best avoided." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe I {{had better}} tell Slugger and Nappy first {{and see what}} they've got to say about it," [...] he reasoned. He went to the bully <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>crony</b> with everything.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm so {{glad you}} got here!" [...] exclaimed Ruth in a low voice, {{and she looked at}} Jack appealingly and then let her eyes rove in the {{direction}} of the bully <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>crony.</b>|$|R
60|$|With caution, {{the bully}} <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>crony</b> {{made their way}} over the snow, and then slipped inside the {{entrance}} to the cave. Ahead of them they saw the flicker of a lantern which Uncle Barney had lit.|$|R
2500|$|Just as the feud {{was about}} to reach its heated highlight, the Junkyard Dog left Mid-South and signed with the World Wrestling Federation without informing booker Bill Watts of his decision. This meant that the {{federation}} was without their biggest face and the shows had to be hastily rebooked. Watts brought in [...] "Master G" [...] (journeyman wrestler George Wells) to take JYD’s place but the feud between Reed and “Master G" [...] never took off forcing Watts to rethink his options. When [...] "General" [...] Skandor Akbar entered the Mid-South and started to build a stable of heels, he presented Buddy Landel with a golden Rolex watch {{with the understanding that}} it wasn’t actually for Landel but for someone else Akbar was trying to recruit. When Landel tried to give the watch to Reed, he became incensed, in the storyline, stomped on the watch, and started to brawl with his former partner. Akbar <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cronies</b> came to ringside, which prompted Reed to rant on them getting the crowd behind him as he told them he didn’t need back-up. When “Hacksaw" [...] Jim Duggan came to his rescue from a 3 on 1 attack, Reed’s face status was cemented. The two Hacksaws feuded with Akbar’s army of Landel, Ted Dibiase, Steve Williams, and Hercules. The two Hacksaws were successful at first, until Reed came up against Kamala. He proved to be too much for Reed, beating him all over the Mid-South territory before Reed quietly left.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, I--er----" [...] stammered Gus. [...] "I--that is----" [...] He did {{not know}} how to proceed. He did not dare deny his guilt, not knowing but what the {{assistant}} teacher might have seen him <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>crony</b> light the tar-barrels.|$|R
60|$|They {{were walking}} along {{the main street of}} Cedarville when they chanced to look into the {{principal}} candy store. There, in front of the soda fountain, were the bully of the Hall <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>crony.</b> They were drinking soda and talking to a young girl who had served them.|$|R
60|$|About an {{hour after}} Lew Flapp <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cronies</b> left camp, Dick Rover and his {{brothers}} received permission to do likewise.|$|E

6000|$|A wordy war lasting {{several minutes}} followed.

60|$|The dude <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>crony,</b> {{as well as}} Larkspur, {{were still}} down upon the Rovers, but for the present they kept quiet, the reason being that they were behind in their lessons and {{had to work hard}} to make up.
