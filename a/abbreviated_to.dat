5|$|All females {{recorded}} in the French Herd Book are controlled under this system, which focuses mainly on maternal qualities derived from measurements of calving ease, and growth and structure of calves. Females that achieve the best indexes for particular traits are then examined in detail by HBL technicians who assign grades based on morphology. The best females receive the qualification Reproductive Recognised (in French Reproductrice Reconnue, <b>abbreviated</b> <b>to</b> RR), which is awarded to the top 10%, or Reproductive Recommended (in French Reproductrice Recommandée, <b>abbreviated</b> <b>to</b> RRE) awarded to the top 1%. The qualifications aid the identification of superior animals.|$|E

5|$|Male progeny go to {{a station}} in Pépieux {{in the south}} of France, where they are fed a ration of corn silage before being {{slaughtered}} at the age of 16 months. In addition to evaluations of growth and conformation in the live animals, carcases, including fat composition, are evaluated. The best bulls identified in progeny testing are formally given the award Young Beef Cattle (in French Viande Jeunes Bovins, <b>abbreviated</b> <b>to</b> JB). Female progeny go to a test station in Moussour in Corrèze, where they are inseminated with the same bulls and calve at two years in confinement before being put out to pasture with their calves. The test station evaluates weight, growth, morphology, fertility, calving ability and milking ability in order to assess their maternal qualities. The best bulls following the tests on their daughters are identified as Maternal Qualities (in French Qualités Maternelles, <b>abbreviated</b> <b>to</b> QM).|$|E

It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of total war, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. According to the {{topology}} of Wireless Mesh Sensor Networks (<b>abbreviate</b> <b>to</b> WMSN), and {{the channel}} access strategy of alternately listening/sleeping scheme, this paper study a neighbor-based adaptive listening/sleeping mechanism for WMSN. Based on the theory of queuing, the paper designed an algorithm named neighbor-based listening and sleeping algorithm (<b>abbreviate</b> <b>to</b> NLS) which can adaptively arrange the duty cycle of transmission frame. On the account of three typical topology for WMSN and consider the neighbor number of Mesh routers and sensor nodes, the performance of proposed scheme are simulated and studied under NS- 2. The study {{results show that the}} combination of the WSN and WMN can be constructed to achieve full interconnection of heterogeneous mesh topology network. Application of queuing theory to establish the WMSN network multi-hop data transmission model can dynamically adjust listening time of different nodes. Using NLS algorithm, the throughput, delay and energy-efficiency of WMSN network are all improved to some extent...|$|R

5|$|At his 1st dan judo examination, Abbe {{had caught}} the {{attention}} of Shotaro Tobata from the Butoku Kai, who had been refereeing at the event. Tobata had suggested to Nakamoto and Abbe that the young man should apply for entry to the renowned Budo Senmon Gakko (<b>abbreviated</b> <b>to</b> 'Busen,' and sometimes referred to as 'Busen College'), a specialist college for martial artists. With the additional help of a teacher named Nakano, Abbe now prepared for the entrance examination in Kyoto. Out of all the candidates, of which there were around 300 that year, 20 would be accepted into the judo programme and 20 into the kendo programme. Abbe performed well and was accepted into both programmes.|$|E
5|$|For males, {{selection}} of the best breeders is more complex. The first step is weaning, when the morphology of calves and the known qualities of their parents are used to make an initial {{selection of}} animals that receive the qualification Reproductive Hope (in French Reproducteur Espoir, <b>abbreviated</b> <b>to</b> Espoir). Annually in excess of about 700 bull calves are then selected to enter the national evaluation station at , close {{to the city of}} Limoges in central France, just after weaning, when they are about seven months old. At Lanaud the animals are grouped together to compare their performance under identical feeding and environmental conditions to the age of 13–14 months. The differences observed between the animals are then related principally to their genetics, which is of interest to breeders because this is what is transmitted to a bull's progeny.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Abbe began {{learning}} judo from Kazohira Nakamoto, {{a former}} police officer. That same year, {{he was promoted to}} the rank of 1st dan in the art and, unusually, he reached 2nd dan the next year, and 3rd dan the year after that. Thus, at the age of 16, he became the youngest judo student ever promoted to 3rd dan—an honour he received directly from Shohei Hamano, an instructor of the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai (<b>abbreviated</b> <b>to</b> 'Butoku Kai' or 'Butokukwai'), which was the official governing body for Japanese martial arts. Abbe also became champion of the Tokushima High School Judo League that year. During his fifth year at the school, Abbe entered a regional tournament involving 30 towns, serving as captain for the team from the town of Kawashima. His speed and agility helped him to many victories, and he received the nickname 'Pegasus' accordingly.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Matt and Jeff {{created their}} own wrestling promotion, The Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (frequently <b>abbreviated</b> <b>to</b> OMEGA Championship Wrestling, or simply OMEGA), in which Matt competed under the name High Voltage. The Hardys {{launched}} the promotion because, at the time, there weren't many places to wrestle, nor did they know anyone who could help. Both Matt and Jeff would take apart the ring {{and put it back}} together at every event they had, while Matt sewed all the costumes worn in OMEGA. The promotion would fold in October 1999, after both Matt and Jeff signed with the World Wrestling Federation. Eight years later in 2007, Highspots.com produced a two-disc DVD set entitled OMEGA: Uncommon Passion, chronicling the history of the promotion, including matches and interviews with many OMEGA wrestlers.|$|E
