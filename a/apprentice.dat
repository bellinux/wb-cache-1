30|$|The {{demands and}} {{responsibilities}} placed on <b>apprentices</b> increase {{the speed of}} their maturation process. <b>Apprentices</b> see deadlines within the workplace as real and as affecting {{the viability of the}} firm and its jobs, unlike the artificial deadlines set by teachers. <b>Apprentices</b> learn from mentors to take pride in their work; Rose (2004) points to electrical <b>apprentices</b> who emulate their instructors’ pride in laying proper electrical wiring though the work will never be seen. <b>Apprentices</b> aspire to mastery in an occupation and becoming part of a community of practice.|$|R
40|$|Employing novel data on over 400 <b>apprenticed</b> {{orphaned}} {{boys from}} the Dutch cities of Leiden and Utrecht, this article explores the functioning of apprenticeship {{during and after the}} guilds. Although the mobility of <b>apprentices</b> was high and contracts were uncertain, no complaints arose from masters or guilds. Wages paid to these <b>apprentices</b> demonstrate that their labour made a gradually increasing contribution to the workshop from the start of their term. This enticed masters to take on <b>apprentices</b> and removed the need for contract enforcement. After the guilds were abolished, the number of <b>apprenticed</b> orphans in the crafts grew, suggesting that guilds previously hampered access to training. Additional data collected for regular (non-orphan) <b>apprentices</b> corroborates these findings...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Apprentices</b> Act {{enacted in}} 1961 and was {{implemented}} effectively in 1962.

30|$|<b>Apprentices</b> {{typically}} {{spend some}} fraction {{of their time}} in the workplace engaged in unskilled (or low-skilled) tasks. As unskilled workers usually receive higher pay than <b>apprentices,</b> there is a possible concern that firms may exploit <b>apprentices</b> by offering low pay and having them perform unskilled tasks – while not providing a sufficient amount of training. A simulation-exercise in Wolter and Ryan (2011, 547) shows that firms could significantly increase their profits if <b>apprentices</b> were to only perform unskilled work. Thus, training regulations need to be in place to prevent the exploitation of <b>apprentices.</b> Ensuring that firms provide educational content in the workplace may, however, be a superior strategy for preventing the exploitation of <b>apprentices,</b> whereas the introduction of general and high minimum wages may in turn provide even more incentives for firms to use <b>apprentices</b> for unskilled labour and provide even less education in the workplace 10.|$|R

5|$|Once a kit {{has reached}} six moons old, they become ‘apprentices’. As {{a mark of}} this, each kit is now given the suffix ‘paw’. For example, ‘Graykit’ would become ‘Graypaw’. An <b>apprentice</b> is then {{assigned}} to a ‘mentor’. Mentors are often carefully chosen {{in order to fulfill}} an apprentice’s full potential; for example, a rather highly-strung <b>apprentice</b> would be given to a calmer mentor, whilst a more timid <b>apprentice</b> would be given to a mentor known for their bravery. It is the job of a mentor to train their <b>apprentice</b> for any given situation, teaching them to hunt, fight, and patrol borders. Apprentices move out of the nursery and sleep in their own separate den. In addition to training, apprentices are also tasked with keeping the camp clean.|$|E
