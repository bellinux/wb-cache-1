40|$|The {{thesis is}} based on the {{assumption}} that the shelters are used by people dependent on addictive substances. Asylum houses provide shelter to those in need to improve their quality of life, but do not provide professional assistance to persons dependent on addictive substances. The objective of my work is to analyze the possibilities to applicate an <b>addictologist</b> in a shelter for the homeless. I also examined the rules for entry and stay in the facility, typical patterns of drug use, and how employees of the shelter works with people with addictions, or how they cooperate with addictology services. To the data acquisition were used two methods of a conversation with the staff of the shelter open and half-structured. Another method was participant observation, study of internal rules and informative emails of the shelter. This is a case study of the one particular shelter. Most users of the shelter shows signs of addiction and <b>addictologist</b> would have applied here. Employees are very skeptical to treat addictions of users in the shelter, but <b>addictologist</b> could be applied in other activities that would focus on the needs of this target group. Such as education, motivation and user administration crisis interventions. The priority of employees in the shelter is the solution of the social situation [...] ...|$|E
40|$|My {{rigorous}} paper {{deals with}} the problematics of virtual background and internet addiction {{which is a very}} current topic both in popular and professional magazines. Primarily, the paper is oriented on risk identification. These risks can later lead to development of internet addiction. The author describes internet background and its influence on identity of an adolescent. The empiric research, carried out amongst 15 year old primary school pupils, shows on necessity to dedicate more time to internet addiction not only as part of non-specific but also specific primary prevention. The paper gives practical recommendations for performing specific primary prevention and also serves as methodological material for pedagogical workers - preventionists, or for social pedagogists - <b>addictologist.</b> Keywords: internet addiction, social deviation, pubescence, prevention, identit...|$|E
40|$|Backrounds: The main {{resources}} of this bachelor's thesis are {{the current situation}} and the system of school-based primary prevention {{and the fact that}} the addictology as an independent scientific discipline is still relatively a new field and its professional position in the labor market is not fully secured. However in the field of preventive measures addictology deals with a similar content as the school prevention and at the same time as the multidisciplinary scientific field with its overlap sees this problem in a very complex way. Objectives: The examined subject and the main point of this thesis is assessing the compatibility of the curriculum of Bachelor's and Master's degree program of the addictology at the 1 st Faculty of Medicine of Charles University with the 4 -level model qualification requirements for workers of the primary prevention in the education. The subsequent aim of this thesis is then possible recommendations for the authors of curricula and accreditation writings of addictilogy studies in terms of completion of education on the basis of which might be in the future made deeper, more effective and to the maximum extent <b>addictologist</b> professional involvement in prevention activities, including the proposal of its implementation. Methods: The theoretical analysis, structured and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Basics: The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} {{the topic of the}} project Revolution Train. It is a primarily preventive program {{in the form of a}} train with six wagons. Among <b>addictologists</b> there are many disagreements about the project. Some see it as a poor quality and inefficient project in the area of influencing risk behavior. Research Goals: The aim of the thesis is to evaluate the Revolution Train project according to the Standards of Professional Competence of Providers of Primary Prevention of Risk Behaviour, analyze opinions of experts in addictology and educationalists. Files and methods: The research used the comparison with the requirements of Standards of Professional Competence of Providers of Primary Prevention of risk Behavior. Furthermore, through interviews with addictology experts and educationalists of the elementary schools in the Ústí region who visited the Revolution Train. A qualitative method is used for this research, in the form of a case study. Results: Opinions of experts and educationalists differ mainly in their view on the story. According to the evaluation by the Standards of Professional Competence of Providers of School Primary Prevention of Risk Behavior, the Revolution Train would not stand. Conclusion and recommendations: The Revolution Train has strengths and [...] ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAIM: To {{determine}} {{the evolution of}} transient elastography (TE) in patients with alcoholic liver disease according to alcohol cessation or continuation. METHODS: We retrospectively selected in our local database all patients who had two TE between June 2005 and November 2010 with chronic alcohol excessive consumption and excluded those with associated cause of liver disease. TE was performed at least one week apart by senior operator. TE examinations with less than ten successful measures or with an interquartile range above 30 % were excluded. We retrospectively reviewed file of all patients to include only patient followed up by trained <b>addictologist</b> and for which definite information on alcohol consumption was available. Concomitant biological parameters [aspartate amino transferase (AST), alanine amino transferase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) ] within 4 wk of initial and final TE were recorded. Putative fibrosis score according to initial and final TE were determined with available cut-off for alcoholic liver disease and hepatitis C. Initial and final putative fibrosis score were compared according to alcohol consumption during follow-up. RESULTS: During the study period 572 patients had TE examination for alcoholic liver disease and 79 of them had at least two examinations. Thirty-seven patients met our criteria with a median follow-up of 32. 5 wk. At {{the end of the}} study, 13 (35 %) were abstinent, and 24 (65 %) relapsers. Eight patients had liver biopsy during follow-up. TE decreased significantly during follow-up in 85 % of abstinent patients [median (range) : - 4. 9 (- 6. 1,- 1. 9) ], leading to a modification of the putative fibrosis stage in 28 %- 71 % of patient according to different cut-off value. In relapsers TE increased in 45 % and decreased in 54 % of patient. There was no statistical difference between initial and final TE in relapsers. In the overall population, using 22. 6 kPa as cut-off for cirrhosis, 4 patients had cirrhosis at initial TE and 3 patients had cirrhosis at final TE. Using 19. 5 kPa as cut-off for cirrhosis, 7 patients had cirrhosis at initial TE and 5 patients had cirrhosis at final TE. Using 12. 5 kPa as cut-off for cirrhosis, 16 patients had cirrhosis at initial TE and 15 patients had cirrhosis at final TE. Evolution of biological data was in accordance with the relapse or abstinent status: abstinence ratio (duration of abstinence/duration follow-up) was correlated with AST ratio (r = - 0. 465, P = 0. 007) and GGT ratio (r = - 0. 662, P < 0. 0001). GGT was correlated with initial (r = 0. 488, P = 0. 002) and final TE (r = 0. 49, P < 0. 005). Final TE was correlated with AST (r = 0. 362, P < 0. 05). Correlation between TE ratio and AST ratio (r = 0. 44, P = 0. 01) revealed that TE varied proportionally to AST for all patients irrespective of their alcohol status. The same relationship was observed between TE ratio and GGT ratio (r = 0. 65, P < 0. 0001). Evolution of TE was significantly correlated with the ratio of time of abstinence to observation time (r = - 0. 387, P = 0. 016) and the evolution of liver enzymes. CONCLUSION: TE significantly decreased with abstinence. Results of TE in alcoholic liver disease cannot be interpreted without taking into account alcohol consumption and liver enzymes...|$|E
