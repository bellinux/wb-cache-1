5|$|After {{five years}} since its {{original}} release, 30 Seconds to Mars was made available in Australia on April 7, 2007 on Virgin Records. EMI re-issued <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> edition of the album in Japan on December 2, 2009. To commemorate the 10th anniversary of the album, Thirty Seconds to Mars hosted an event called MarsX on August 27, 2012. It was broadcast worldwide through the online platform VyRT and included live playback and commentary of the record with the band, interactive discussion focused on the formation of Thirty Seconds to Mars, and exclusive acoustic performances. The album was also re-issued as <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> edition picture disc. To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the long-playing vinyl, Universal Music re-issued a double LP of 30 Seconds to Mars on September 23, 2016. A re-release on red translucent vinyl was pressed the following year in <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> edition for the 15th anniversary of the album.|$|E

5000|$|This {{definition}} {{differs from}} that of <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> point, in that for <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> point it is required that every open set containing [...] contains at least one point of A different from x.

An adherent point which is not <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> point is <b>an</b> isolated point.|$|R

40|$|Misconceptions of {{the limit}} concept were {{examined}} in 130 pre-engineering students in Dilla Universities. Questionnaire and Interview were deigned to explore students understanding {{of the idea of}} <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> of <b>a</b> function and to explore the cognitive schemes for the limit concept. The study employed a quantitative-descriptive or survey design. The empirical investigation was done in two phases. A questionnaire on the idea of <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> was given to 130 students during the first phase. During the second phase 14 interviews were conducted. Then, the results indicated that students in the study see <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> as unreachable, see <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> as <b>an</b> approximation, see <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> as <b>a</b> boundary, view <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> as <b>a</b> dynamic process and not as a static object, and are under the impression that a function will always have <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> at <b>a</b> point. Regarding the relationship between a continuous function and <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> were: Students think that a function has to be defined at a point to have <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> at that point. A function that is undefined at a certain point does not have a limit; Students think that when a function has <b>a</b> <b>limit,</b> then it has to be continuous at that point. Other misconceptions were: The limit is equal to the function value at a point, i. e. <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> can be found by a method of substitution, when one divides zero by zero, the answer is zero, Most of the students know that any other number divided by zero is undefined. The study concluded that many students’ knowledge and understanding rest largely on isolated facts, routine calculation, memorizing algorithm, procedures and that their conceptual understanding of limits, continuity and infinity is deficient.
