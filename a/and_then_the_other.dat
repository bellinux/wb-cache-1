25|$|Hermaphroditism {{occurs when}} a given {{individual}} in a species possesses {{both male and female}} reproductive organs, or can alternate between possessing first one, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Hermaphroditism is common in invertebrates but rare in vertebrates. It can be contrasted with gonochorism, where each individual in a species is either male or female, and remains that way throughout their lives. Most fish are gonochorists, but hermaphroditism is known to occur in 14 families of teleost fishes.|$|E
25|$|The {{last two}} metrics appear {{for example in}} routing a machine that drills a given set of holes in a printed circuit board. The Manhattan metric {{corresponds}} to a machine that adjusts first one co-ordinate, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> so the time {{to move to a}} new point is the sum of both movements. The maximum metric corresponds to a machine that adjusts both co-ordinates simultaneously, so the time to move to a new point is the slower of the two movements.|$|E

25|$|Female P. californicus and P. apacheanus are {{unusual in}} that they perform an {{acceptance}} dance just before the male touches them.

25|$|Sometime between 10:15 and 11:15 pm, a drunk McGreavy became infuriated {{with the}} Ralph children, {{beginning}} with the baby, Samantha, who had been crying for her bottle. McGreavy violently killed Samantha <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two children, each in a different manner. Eight-month-old Samantha died from a fractured skull, 2-year-old Dawn had her throat slit and 4-year-old Paul was strangled. After killing the three children, McGreavy {{went down to the}} basement and retrieved a pickaxe. He further mutilated their bodies with the pickaxe before impaling the three bodies on the spikes of a wrought iron fence in a neighbour's yard. He then left the home.|$|E
25|$|The {{other type}} of {{exchange}} {{is known as a}} bike-to-bike exchange. The only reason that a team would use this type of exchange is if the team members are not all approximately the same height. More often than not, it is because one member of the team is shorter than the rest because most cyclists in the race are fairly tall. This exchange is far simpler than the other. The first rider only has to come in and tap the next rider's shoulder or arm <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> racer can begin. While this is much easier than the other exchange, it is significantly slower because the second racer is starting from a dead stop, while riders performing the man-to-man exchange have some forward momentum.|$|E

2500|$|The {{execution}} of Dorrego generated a huge controversy in Buenos Aires. Varela wrote a new mail to Lavalle, instructing him to forge documents {{to make things}} seem {{as if he had}} conducted a trial in Navarro, but Lavalle kept this mail as well. The federals saw Dorrego as a martyr and increased their rejection for the military government. The National Convention in Santa Fe (the highest national authority at the time) rejected the coup and the {{execution of}} Dorrego as crimes of high treason against the state, and appointed Estanislao López the leader of the troops that would be sent to remove the government in Buenos Aires. The provinces of Córdoba and Entre Ríos joined <b>the</b> offensive, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> <b>The</b> government in Buenos Aires began a campaign of political repression against all federals. Lavalle was soon reinforced by general José María Paz [...] The number of deaths caused by the political repression was so high that in 1829 Buenos Aires had a higher number of deaths than births.|$|R
25|$|The inner pair of this {{triple star}} system, Lambda Tauri AB, orbit {{around each other}} with a period of 3.95days and a low {{eccentricity}} of about 0.025. Their orbital plane is inclined by around 76° to the line of sight from the Earth, so it is being viewed from nearly edge on and the two stars form an Algol-like eclipsing binary system. The combined brightness of the pair varies from magnitude +3.37 to +3.91 as first one star <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> pass in front of its companion. The primary member, λ Tau A, undergoes a decrease of 0.435 ± 0.050 in magnitude during an eclipse, while the secondary component, λ Tau B, decreases by 0.09–0.10 in magnitude. The mean physical separation between these two stars is estimated at 21.91 times the radius of the Sun, or 0.1Astronomical Units.|$|E
25|$|On 22 July 1974, {{during the}} Turkish {{invasion}} of Cyprus, {{a pair of}} Greek F-5Αs intercepted a pair of Turkish F-102 near Agios Efstratios. The aircraft engaged in a dogfight, during {{which one of the}} Turkish pilots fired a Falcon missile against one of the F-5s piloted by Thomas Skampardonis. Skampardonis managed to evade the missile <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Greek pilot Ioannis Dinopoulos, who up to that point was undetected by the Turks, fired two AIM-9B missiles. The first AIM-9 missed its target but the second shot down one of the F-102s. The pilot of the remaining F-102 became disoriented and fled westwards. When he realized his mistake, he turned east towards the Turkish coast but run out of fuel. This forced him to ditch his aircraft, suffering fatal injuries.|$|E
25|$|Two {{companies}} of the 2/9th Battalion were to attack, covered by {{fire from the}} mortars and machine-guns on Ship Hill and the 4th RHA. The attack was to capture the southern redoubt <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two companies would attack along the flanks of the redoubt and D Company, 2/10th Australian Infantry Battalion, would advance from Brigadiers Hill to open a track across the marsh and shorten the supply route. The cavalry would mount a subsidiary attack from the northern approach down Pipsqueak Valley, to take the airfield. A sandstorm blew up and clogged weapons which needed to be cleaned, then in the afternoon the storm abated but was sufficient to obscure the Australian assembly. There were exchanges of fire and from Ship Hill, the Australian machine-gunners could hit the Italian defences around the oasis and suppressed several positions. An Italian sniper stalked the machine-gun posts to no effect.|$|E

500|$|The Orphanage was {{received}} very well by American critics on its original release. The film ranking website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 87% of critics {{had given the}} film positive reviews, based upon a sample of 168. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 74, based on 33 reviews. Critics praised the film for its lack of cheap scares. Film critic for the Chicago Sun Times Roger Ebert approved of the film claiming it to be [...] "deliberately aimed at viewers with developed attention spans. It lingers to create atmosphere, a sense of place, a sympathy with the characters, instead of rushing into cheap thrills". Bill Goodykoontz of the Arizona Republic echoed this statement noting, [...] "Bayona never lets The Orphanage descend into cheap horror. The scares here are expertly done and, placed {{in the context of}} Laura's state of mind, well-earned, perhaps even explainable (or not)." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star wrote, [...] "The year's best horror picture {{is also one of the}} simplest. The Orphanage makes little if any use of digital tricks to present its numerous terrors." [...] The casting of Chaplin and Rueda was praised while the role of Carlos was called dull. Goodykoontz noted the role of Carlos, saying [...] "Cayo is rather pedestrian as Carlos, but he isn't given that much to do". Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune shared this opinion saying, [...] "Rueda has a great pair of peepers for this assignment. When she looks one way <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> while skulking through the hallways of her childhood home, every nerve-wracking whatwasthat? registers, and how. Cayo is pretty dull by comparison, but Chaplin certainly is not." [...] Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail praised Rueda stating, [...] "The strongest appeal of the film is the brooding, intense performance by Spanish actress, Belen Rueda." ...|$|E
