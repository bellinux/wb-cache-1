5|$|Over time, {{training}} programs included greater {{cooperation between the}} Army's combat arms <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> services. A Combined Training Centre, also known as HMAS Assault, opened on 1 September 1942 at Nelson Bay, adjacent to Port Stephens, New South Wales, as a central establishment for the training staffs, beach parties and small boat crews. In July 1942, a Combined Training School was established at Bribie Island, Queensland, and nearby Toorbul Point for Army units. During 1943 and 1944, combined training with the RAAF and RAN was also carried out at Trinity Beach, near Cairns in preparation for amphibious operations in the South West Pacific as the Allies advanced.|$|E
5|$|The Stresemann's bushcrow nests either {{alone or}} in a small, loosely {{connected}} colony of three to five nests. It is monogamous and may form a lifelong pair bond. The bushcrow occasionally has a third bird, or in rare cases two to four more, help the breeding couple both build the nest {{and care for the}} young. The helpers may also not be restricted to helping one nest at a time, as they have been seen at nests across the loose colonies. Allofeeding and allopreening, where the birds feed or preen each other, takes place both between the pair <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> bushcrows in the colony. The bushcrow lays its eggs shortly after the first rains, which normally occur in late February and early March, leading to its eggs being laid in late March and early April.|$|E

Colonel Descoins informed the commission that they should sign a protocol. On December 10, 1916 Colonel Descoins and the commission signed a protocol, according to which an autonomous province would be established on the territories of Korçë, Bilishti, Kolonja, Opar and Gora. It was also agreed that the 14 members of the commission would make up the administrative council, responsible for maintaining order.|$|E

5|$|The film's locations, {{with the}} {{exception}} of scenes filmed at a museum and at a farmhouse, were built on the Montreal sound stage. Production designer James Chinlund and his crew built sets for The Fountain in a large warehouse in Montreal. The sets included the 16th century jungle settings and the bubble-shaped spacecraft containing the tree of life and its garden. The spacecraft set was placed against greenscreen, and the crew hung colored reflective material, which included green, black, gold, and silver, on three circular tracks around the set. One material would be moved into place instead of the heavy equipment, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> materials partitioned off, a light source was used with the preferred material. Silver was used for scenes in which the spacecraft moved through the stars, and gold was used for when it entered the nebula.|$|E

25|$|Tensions {{were high}} between the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and no {{representative}} from the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church attended the official recognition of the newly autocephalous body. However, the Ethiopian Church has recognized the Autocephalous status of the Church of Eritrea although it objected to the method in which the Coptic Church went about granting it. Eritrea's first two Patriarchs were originally Archbishops of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and the first Patriarch, Abune Phillipos did visit Addis Ababa during joint efforts by the two Churches to explore a possible resolution to a border conflict that had broken out {{between the two countries}} in 1998. The two churches, remain in full communion with each other <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Churches of Oriental Orthodoxy, although the Ethiopian Church, along with the Coptic Orthodox Church have not recognized the deposition of the third Patriarch of Eritrea, and the enthronement of the fourth Patriarch, Abune Dioskoros.|$|E
500|$|The {{apparent}} {{contradiction between}} {{the claim that}} [...] "all men are created equal" [...] {{and the existence of}} American slavery attracted comment when the Declaration was first published.

[...] Jefferson himself was a prominent Virginia slave holder, having owned hundreds of slaves.

500|$|The 1899 Australian tour saw Trumble score 1,183runs {{and take}} 142wickets; {{he was only}} the second Australian, after George Giffen, to score 1,000runs and take 100wickets in an English season {{as part of a}} touring team. In the Test series, Trumble took 15wickets at an average of 25.00 and made 232runs at an average of 38.66. [...] Wisden said of Trumble's batting that season, [...] " [...] played so {{consistently}} well as {{to make it clear that}} if he had not been a bowler he would have been a great batsman". Dry pitches saw his bowling average fall off a little from the 1896 tour but Wisden stated that he [...] "bowled quite as well as in 1896" [...] and [...] " [...] never seemed easy to hit, and whenever the ground gave him least advantage...he was deadly". Australia won the Second Test by 10wickets <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Tests finishing in draws, they retained the Ashes in a one Test to nil series victory. Trumble played particularly well in the Third Test at Headingley, where he took 5wickets for 60runs and was the highest run-scorer in the Australian second innings with 56. These efforts led him to achieve the number 1 ranking in ICC Test Bowler Rankings for the year 1899 (he retained it for the next 5 years).|$|E
500|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in 1833, {{the year}} in which the canal made its lowest profit since the death of the Duke. On 19July the Marquess of Stafford (now the 1st Duke of Sutherland) died and the profits from the canal passed to Francis Egerton. On 25September Bradshaw's son, Captain James Bradshaw, who had been acting as a deputy {{superintendent}} to the Trustees, and who had been expected to succeed his father as Superintendent, committed suicide. The agent for both Francis Egerton and his older brother, who was now the 2nd Duke of Sutherland, was James Loch. [...] The events that followed were [...] "stage-managed by Loch". He reported to Francis Egerton that Bradshaw was no longer fit to be Superintendent, and then persuaded Bradshaw to retire on his full salary. It had been expected that he would appoint his other son, William Rigby Bradshaw, as his successor, but Loch persuaded him to appoint James Sothern in the position; Sothern had been the principal agent of the Trust since December 1832. He took over the position of Superintendent on 3February 1834. [...] The appointment of Sothern was not a success. Charges were made against him of dishonesty and of nepotism. He entered into disputes and disagreements with Loch, with Francis Egerton, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two trustees. (Sir Archibald Macdonald had died in 1826; by this time his place had been taken by the 10th Earl of Devon). To avoid a costly lawsuit, at the end of 1836 Sothern agreed to retire on various conditions which included receipt of £45,000. On 1March 1837, he was succeeded as Superintendent by James Loch.|$|E
