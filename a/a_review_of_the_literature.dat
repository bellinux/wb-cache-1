25|$|Drinking in {{moderation}} {{has been found}} to help those who have suffered a heart attack survive it.

However, they noted that at present there have been no randomised trials to confirm the evidence which suggests a protective role of low doses of alcohol against heart attacks. However, moderate alcohol consumption is associated with hypertension. There is an increased risk of hypertriglyceridemia, cardiomyopathy, hypertension, and stroke if 3 or more standard drinks of alcohol are taken per day.|$|E
25|$|Establishing {{continued}} efficacy {{beyond a}} few weeks can be complicated by the difficulty in distinguishing between {{the return of the}} original insomnia complaint and withdrawal or rebound related insomnia. Sleep EEG studies on hypnotic benzodiazepines show tolerance tends to occur completely after one to four weeks with sleep EEG returning to pretreatment levels. The paper concluded, due to concerns about long-term use both toxicity and tolerance and dependence, as well as controversy over long-term efficacy, wise prescribers should restrict benzodiazepines to {{a few weeks}} and avoid continuing prescriptions for months or years. <b>A</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> found the nonpharmacological treatment options were a more effective treatment option for insomnia due to their sustained improvements in sleep quality.|$|E

2500|$|Certain {{aspects of}} {{religions}} and spirituality may, hypothetically, promote or hinder certain psychological virtues that increase resilience. Research has not established connection between spirituality and resilience. According to the 4th edition of Psychology of Religion by Hood, et al., the [...] "study of positive psychology {{is a relatively}} new development...there has not yet been much direct empirical research looking specifically at the association of religion and ordinary strengths and virtues". In <b>a</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> on the relationship between religiosity/spirituality and PTSD, amongst the significant findings, about half of the studies showed a positive relationship and half showed a negative relationship between measures of religiosity/spirituality and resilience.

2500|$|In Cannabis and driving: <b>a</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> and commentary, the United Kingdom's Department for Transport {{reviewed}} data on cannabis and driving, finding [...] "Cannabis impairs driving behaviour. However, this impairment {{is mediated}} in that subjects under cannabis treatment appear to perceive {{that they are}} indeed impaired. Where they can compensate, they do, for example ... effects of driving behaviour are present {{up to an hour}} after smoking but do not continue for extended periods". The report summarizes current knowledge about the effects of cannabis on driving and accident risk based on a review of available literature published since 1994 and the effects of cannabis on laboratory based tasks. The study identified young males, amongst whom cannabis consumption is frequent and increasing, and in whom alcohol consumption is also common, as a risk group for traffic accidents. The cause, according to the report, is driving inexperience and factors associated with youth relating to risk taking, delinquency and motivation. These demographic and psychosocial variables may relate to both drug use and accident risk, thereby presenting an artificial relationship between use of drugs and accident involvement.|$|E
2500|$|Once formed, first {{impressions}} {{tend to be}} stable. <b>A</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> on the accuracy and impact of {{first impressions}} on rater-based assessments found that raters' first impressions are highly correlated with later scores, but it is unclear exactly why. One study tested stability by asking participants to form impressions people based purely on photographs. Participants' opinions {{of the people in}} photographs did not significantly differ after interacting with that person a month later. One potential reason for this stability is that one's first impressions could serve as a guide for his/her next steps, such as what questions are asked and how raters go about scoring. More research needs to be done on the stability of first impressions to fully understand how first impressions guide subsequent treatment, self-fulfilling prophecies, and the halo effect. Assessment tools can influence impressions too, for example if a question provides only a dichotomous [...] "yes" [...] or [...] "no" [...] response or if a rater uses a scale (ratio). Although this study was conducted with the intention of improving rating methods in medical education, the literature review was sufficiently broad enough to generalize.|$|E
