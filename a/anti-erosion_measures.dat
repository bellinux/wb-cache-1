40|$|Loss {{of water}} and {{nutrients}} through runoff are major agriculture problems for inherent poor fertile soils in semiarid West Africa. The intensification of crop production requires an integration of soil, water and nutrient management that is locally acceptable and beneficial for smallholder farmers. To that end, two semi-permeable {{soil and water conservation}} measures (stone rows, grass strips) and two nitrogen inputs (compost, urea) applied alone or in combination were studied on the Central Plateau of Burkina Faso. Stone rows greatly reduce runoff, soil erosion and improve soil moisture. Under unfertilised continuous sorghum cropping, stone rows induced limited effect on soil fertility improvement. During erratic rainfall years in the Sahelian zone, stone rows alone doubled sorghum yield compared to plots without stone rows and therefore, can reduce risks of crop failure. During well-distributed rainfall years, stone rows alone did not induce significant yield increase. Grass strips of Andropogon gayanus was also an efficient <b>anti-erosion</b> <b>measure</b> and could be an interesting alternative to stone rows, especially in stone-limiting areas. However, Andropogon grass must be managed properly to alleviate shading and other effects of competition on crops near to the strips. The sole applications of compost or urea improved nutrient uptake and crop biomass production that subsequently demands more available water for transpiration. Combining stone rows or grass strips with compost in intensified crop production systems resulted into substantial crop yields and economic benefits. This integrated water and nutrient management may help to alleviate poverty and may empower smallholder farmers to invest in soil management for better crop production in West Africa...|$|R

It is shown that Vetiver grass is able to establish a full-stop of bank erosion caused by rapid drawdown. Therefore it provides us with strong indications that it is highly suitable as an <b>anti-erosion</b> <b>measure.</b> A combination of cohesive soil and Vetiver grass provides the best protection against erosion, which implies that it is highly suitable for banks in delta areas, which consist pre-dominantly of cohesive soil. A single hedge of Vetiver grass planted on the outer slope of a dike can reduce the wave run-up volume by 55 %, in contrary with sod-forming grasses that give no reduction. Planting multiple hedges along the contour of the outer slope might result in even more reduction. The application of Vetiver grass on existing dikes may provide a substantial reinforcement of these dikes. The advantages of Vetiver grass above conventional methods with the use of stone are numerous: · Vetiver grass is sustainable. Vetiver hedges of over 100 years old have been found. Vetiver grass is not invasive and no significant diseases are known. Vetiver grass will, in contrary with traditional methods, increase in strength in time. · Vetiver grass is an economic attractive solution. In most countries in South-East Asia Vetiver grass can be planted for less than $ 3 per meter, while solutions consisting of stone and concrete are expensive in delta areas. Vetiver grass allows people to protect their own property. Since the costs are low and it is easy to use local initiatives can be easily achieved.

40|$|Soil erosion on {{agricultural}} land {{is a growing}} problem in Western Europe and constitutes a threat to soil quality and {{to the ability of}} soils to provide environmental services. The off-site impacts of runoff and eroded soil, principally eutrophication of water bodies, sedimentation of gravel-bedded rivers, loss of reservoir capacity, muddy flooding of roads and communities, are increasingly recognised and costed. The shift of funding in the European Union (EU) from production-related to avoidance of pollution and landscape protection, raises issues of cross-compliance: public support for agriculture has to be seen to give value-for-money. In this context risk-assessment procedures have been introduced to help farmers recognise sites where either certain crops should not be grown or <b>anti-erosion</b> <b>measures</b> are required. In England, Defra [Defra, 2005 a. Controlling Soil Erosion: a Manual for the Assessment and Management of Agricultural Land at Risk of Water Erosion in Lowland England. Revised September 2005. Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, London] sets out a system of risk-assessment, including ranking of crops susceptible to erosion and <b>anti-erosion</b> <b>measures,</b> that may be selected. We assess this system using field data for an area of erodible soils in the Rother valley, Sussex. The Defra approach correctly identifies most at-risk fields and, taken together with land-use maps, allows non-compliance with advice to be highlighted. We suggest a simple extension to the system which would further identify at-risk fields in terms of possible damage to roads and rivers from muddy runoff. The increased risk of erosion in the study area is associated with certain crops: potatoes, winter cereals, maize and grazed turnips and seems unlikely {{to be the result of}} changes in rainfall which over the last 130 years are minimal. We have not evaluated proposed <b>anti-erosion</b> <b>measures</b> in the area because few have been put into practice.

The paper presents a sample analysis of the possibilities of increasing water retention in the agricultural loess catchments with periodic streams. The scope of the study included the determination of physical parameters of selected sub-catchments (geometry, soil cover, land use, etc.) and of the sources of threat to water resources, resulting from construction and geomorphological conditions. Pre-design assumptions of dammings were developed, taking into account <b>anti-erosion</b> protective <b>measures,</b> and treatments increasing the landscape retention of water were proposed. Creating surface retention objects should be an important source of water in simplified agroecosystems, especially in regions, where productivity to a great extent depends on natural weather conditions. Proper management of the fourth-order loess basin of the Ciemięga River (area of about 150 km 2, the presence of 50 lateral valleys) could give a temporary reservoir retention reaching 500 thousand m 3.

40|$|Erosion {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of declining soil {{fertility}} and productivity in ACP countries and farmers often avoid <b>anti-erosion</b> <b>measures</b> because of the labour required. One exception is the successful soil and water conservation strategy being implemented by farmers of the Machakos district in Kenya. Machakos farmers adopted bench-terracing as long ago as 1948, when soldiers resuming from service in the British army experimented with techniques that they had seen in India. Though bench-terracing is laborious, because it requires dug soil to be thrown uphill, farmers have found that manuring is more effective on terraced land, since it is not washed off. Manuring also helps to improve water infiltration and therefore bench terraces are more effective for water conservation. Machakos farmers have found that manuring and terracing are the two most effective ways of maintaining and even improving soil productivity and, despite relatively low rainfall in the area, they are able to grow traditional food crops and vegetable crops for sale in Nairobi. Historically the Machakos district was prone to drought and food shortages. In the 1930 s there were despairing reports on the eroded grazing land and arable fields and food shirtages were experienced in fourteen out of twenty years 1942 and 1962. The first attempts to combat erosion and conserve moisture were through the compulsory digging of contour ditches, narrow based terracing where soil is thrown downhill. The initiative failed due to lack of farmer commitment, and even resistance, to the imposed contour construction. It was 20 years later, when farmers could see the value of benchterracing for themselves, that voluntary effort transformed the communiity. By 1978, most of the arable land in the older settled areas had been terraced. However, population growth forced resource-poor farmers into newer areas. These farmers were provided with toois and training for leaders of farmers groups by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA), the European Community-supported Machakos Integrated Development Programme (MIDP) and the local Catholic Diocese. By 1990 most of the land that needed terracing had been terraced.

Earlier studies showed that smallholders are constrained in doing so {{because of lack of}} incentives, high risks, production problems and lack of an entrepreneurial mindset. Deterioration and improvement of the natural resource base impact these constraints. In this paper we not only focus on soil fertility decline and the available measures to combat this decline but also on the reasons smallholders have for applying them or not. 94 % of the 232 smallholders we interviewed in this study report a decline of their soil fertility. During interviews smallholders in northern Ghana gave their reasons for (not) applying the soil fertility enhancing measures manure use, use of household waste, compost making, use of mineral fertilizer, fallowing, improved fallow, use of cover crops, use of human excreta, crop rotation, <b>anti-erosion</b> <b>measures,</b> and non-burning practices.

The impact of River Ntahangwa on the water quality of this part of Lake Tanganyika was compared with that of an unpolluted river, the Mugere. A shallow bay, not influenced by a river, was used as a reference station. Chemical analyses were carried out at four week intervals during nearly a year. Samples were taken at different distances from the shore and at different depths. River impact was detected up to 100 m from both river mouths. Even at 50 m from the mouth of the polluted River Ntahangwa, no important decrease of dissolved oxygen was detected. Chlorophyll-a maxima were found 100 m from the Ntahangwa mouth, but this was also the case 100 m from shore in the unpolluted bay. Lake water at 60 m depth was saturated with oxygen during the dry season, as it used to be in 1956. The rivers studied descent initially within the lake due to greater sediment load and lower water temperature.

Intensification involves limiting the area of cultivation, and maintaining, if not restoring, soil fertility {{by the use of}} fertilizers or manure. But, are the peasant farmers of this area ready to proceed in this direction? A study by the Rural Production Systems Research Division of Mali's Institute for Rural Economy records the behaviour of nine peasant farmers typical of the Kouiala and Sikasso circles {{in the heart of the}} Southern Mali cotton growing zone between 1977 and 1987. Such a small sample might suggest that the results should be treated with caution, nevertheless/he study appears to demonstrate that such an intensification is possible for the larger cotton producers who can afford to take risks. On the other hand, this kind of intensification seems to be of little interest to small-scale farmers who seek only their own and their family's survival rather than increased yield, and will pursue this survival objective by whatever means they can. The Royal Tropical Institute (KIT) of Amsterdam, the publishers of this study, 'Agricultural Intensification in Southern Mali: fact or fantasy?', has devoted a further publication to the area with the title 'From <b>anti-erosion</b> <b>measures</b> in the fields to rural land management.

40|$|An {{overview}} {{is given}} on the predictive quality of spatially distributed runoff and erosion models. A summary is given {{of the results}} of model comparison workshops organized by the Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems Focus 3 programme, as well as other results obtained by individual researchers. The results concur with the generally held viewpoint in the literature that the predictive quality of distributed models is moderately good for total discharge at the outlet, and not very good for net soil loss. This is only true if extensive calibration is done: uncalibrated results are generally bad. The more simple lumped models seem to perform equally well as the more complex distributed models, although the latter produce more detailed spatially distributed results that can aid the researcher. All these results are outlet based: models are tested on lumped discharge and soil loss or on hydrographs and sedigraphs. Surprisingly few tests have been done on the comparison of simulated and modelled erosion patterns, although this may arguably be just as important in the sense of designing <b>anti-erosion</b> <b>measures</b> and determining source and sink areas. Two studies are shown in which the spatial performance of the erosion model LISEM (Limburg soil erosion model) is analysed. It seems that: (i) the model is very sensitive to the resolution (grid cell size); (ii) the spatial pattern prediction is not very good; (iii) the performance becomes better when the results are resampled to a lower resolution and (iv) the results are improved when certain processes in the model (in this case gully incision) are restricted to so called 'critical areas', selected from the digital elevation model with simple rules. status: publishe...|$|E
