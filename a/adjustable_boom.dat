50|$|The LifeChat LX-3000 is a wired headset {{that connects}} to a PC by a USB cable. The headset {{features}} a microphone on an <b>adjustable</b> <b>boom</b> that can rotate up and down. The headset {{also has an}} in-line volume control switch with a mute button and a Windows Live Call button that activates voice calls in Microsoft Windows. The LX-3000 uses the CM108 USB audio chip from C-Media.|$|E
5000|$|Boom - use an <b>adjustable</b> <b>boom</b> with a winch {{to recover}} {{vehicles}} from a ditch, over an embankment, or any place the vehicle cannot be safely reach backing-up. Some booms are fixed, some heavy pivoting A-frames, others hydraulic-powered telescoping tubes. In the past boom trucks used a [...] "hook and chain" [...] system where chains are looped around the vehicle frame or axle, then lifted by a boom winch. A towbar with heavy rubberized mats connects {{the truck and}} vehicle, {{so it can be}} towed on its other axle. [...] "Slings" [...] and [...] "belt lifts" [...] are an evolution, with rubber straps replacing part of the chains. Slings are not used much today because they can scratch the bumpers of cars. But they are sometimes used for towing vehicles that have been in an accident or have {{one or two of the}} front or rear wheels missing or for pickup trucks and other vehicles that have steel bumpers. Cars equipped with all-wheel drive cannot be towed with a sling, since it can cause problems with the car's drivetrain.|$|E
40|$|Acoustic {{reflection}} technique is a non-invasive method of measuring vocal tract anatomy. It {{is useful in}} studying a number of conditions including sleep apnea and speech disorders. Current studies at the Vocal Tract Lab of the University of Wisconsin seek to compare acoustic {{reflection technique}} data with information from medical imaging studies. The current protocol for Acoustic Reflection Technique calls for the wave tube device {{to be held in}} the hands of a researcher throughout the duration of the scans. This is inducing variability in the data. For this reason it has been proposed to design an adjustable stand for the acoustic reflection wave tube device in an effort to improve accuracy and repeatability of scans. Several designs were considered and evaluated. The final design incorporates a miniature <b>adjustable</b> <b>boom</b> stand attached to a custom high density polyethylene base that is used to hold the wave tube device. This design also features rubber strapping and a silicone lining to firmly hold the wave tube in place. Further development of this device may include modifications made to improve the range of possible test subjects as well as a counterweight system to prevent tipping under al...|$|E
40|$|Spring clamp fixture holds small {{electronic}} components in a desired position {{while they are}} being soldered on a circuit board. The spring clamp is clipped {{on the edge of}} the circuit board and an <b>adjustable</b> spring-steel <b>boom</b> holds components against the board. The felt pad at the end of the boom is replaced with different attachments for other holding tasks...|$|R
40|$|Headsets for speech {{communication}} {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of applications. The basic idea is to allow hands-free speech communication, leaving both hands available for other tasks. One typical headset application is aircraft pilot communication. The pilot must be able to communicate with personnel on the ground and at the same time use both hands to control the aircraft. Communication headsets usually consist of a pair of headphones and a microphone attached with an <b>adjustable</b> <b>boom.</b> Headphone design varies widely between different manufacturers and models. In its simplest form, the headphone has an open construction providing little or no attenuation of the environmental noise. In headsets designed for noisy environments, the headphones are mounted in ear cups with cushions that provide some attenuation. The microphone is primarily designed to pick up the speech signal, but if the headset is used in a noisy environment, the background noise will also be picked up and transmitted together with the speech. As a consequence, speech intelligibility at the receive end will be reduced, possibly to zero. To increase the speech-to-noise ratio, it is common to use a directional microphone that has a lower sensitivity to sound incident from other directions than the frontal direction. In addition to this, the microphone electronics are usually equipped with a gate function that completely shuts off the microphone signal if its level drops below a threshold value. The purpose of the gate is to open the channel for transmission only when a speech signal is present. Headsets are frequently used in noisy environments where they suffer from problems of speech intelligibility. Even if an ear-cup type headset is used, the attenuation is relatively poor for low frequencies. Low frequency noise has a masking effect on speech, which significantly reduces the speech intelligibility. Several cases have been reported in which the sound level of the communication signal was increased to hazardous levels by the user to overcome this low frequency masking effect [1, 2]. Ear exposure to the communication system resulted in hearing damage, such as hearing loss, tinnitus and hyperacusis...|$|E
