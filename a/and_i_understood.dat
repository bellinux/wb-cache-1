[...] Public messages of condolence were made by McCartney and Starr, with the former saying [...] "She was a lovely lady who I've known since our early days together in Liverpool. She was a good mother to Julian and will be missed by us all ..." [...] and the latter [...] "Peace and love to Julian Lennon God bless Cynthia". Ono also issued a statement, emphasizing the position she held in common: [...] "Being a single parent of a strong and intelligent boy is never easy. Cynthia <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> each other in that way, wishing well for our sons and their future." [...] Beatles biographer Hunter Davies, who had spent considerable time with her and John in the 1960s while researching his book, remembered her as [...] "a lovely woman ... She was totally different from John in that she was quiet, reserved and calm." ...|$|E
500|$|Because of his {{enormous}} commitment to Steven Spielberg's Hook, which opened {{the same month}} as JFK, composer John Williams {{did not have time}} to compose a conventional score for the entire film. Instead he composed and conducted six musical sequences in full for JFK before he saw the film in its entirety. Soon after recording this music, he traveled to New Orleans where Stone was still shooting the film and saw approximately an hour's worth of edited footage and dailies. Williams remembers, [...] "I thought his handling of Lee Harvey Oswald was particularly strong, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> some of the atmosphere of the film – the sordid elements, the underside of New Orleans." [...] Stone and his team then actually cut the film to fit Williams' music after the composer had scored and recorded musical cues in addition to the six he had done prior to seeing the film. For the motorcade sequence, Williams described the score he composed as [...] "strongly kinetic music, music of interlocking rhythmic disciplines." [...] The composer remembered the moment he learned of Kennedy's assassination and it stuck with him for years. This was a significant factor in his deciding to work on the film. Williams said, [...] "This is a very resonant subject for people of my generation, and that's why I welcomed the opportunity to participate in this film." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, O'Donnell made a cameo in Pitch Perfect 2, {{playing a}} co-host on The View. Deadline called the cameo [...] "a bit that already seems dated." [...] That same year, she {{appeared}} in an episode Empire, playing Pepper O'Leary, [...] "a tough criminal who shared a cell for years with Cookie Lyon." [...] In preparation for the role, she hired an acting coach and stated, [...] "I prepared for this like I've never prepared for anything in my career, because I didn't want to disappoint <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> the pace at which they work." [...] O'Donnell also appeared as herself in two documentaries that same year. In April 2015, Roseanne For President! was released, a film about Roseanne Barr's presidential bid in 2012. O'Donnell appeared in the film alongside Michael Moore and Sandra Bernhard. In September 2015, the documentary Everything Is Copy was released, a film by Jacob Bernstein about his mother Nora Ephron. O'Donnell appeared in the documentary to help [...] "bring his mother into focus" [...] along {{with a number of}} other celebrities.|$|E
2500|$|John McNamara, Esq., gave {{evidence}} {{that on the}} evening of 7 April, he believed at some time after eleven o'clock, {{he came out of the}} playhouse with Martha Ray, and having seen her [...] "in some difficulties at the playhouse", offered his help in handing her to her carriage. She took his arm. As they came out of the passage into the Covent Garden playhouse and were two steps from the carriage, he heard the report of a pistol, while Miss Ray was still holding his right arm with her left hand. She fell instantly. He thought the pistol had been [...] "fired out of wantonness" [...] and that Miss Ray had fainted. He knelt to help her, but found blood on his hands, and got her into the Shakspeare tavern. He did not see Hackman at the time, but after he had been arrested, asked him what had possessed him, and he answered [...] "that it was not a proper place to ask that question, or something to that effect... I asked him his name, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> from him that his name was Hackman; I think he pronounced his name with an H. I asked him if he knew anybody. He said, he knew a Mr. Booth, in Craven-street in the Strand, and desired he might be sent for. He desired to see the lady. I did not tell him she was dead; somebody else did. I objected to his seeing her at that time. I had her removed into another room. From the great quantity of blood I had about me I got sick, and was obliged to go home. I know no more about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Next morning, Thursday, Sasun Eff. {{came in at}} 10; I {{took him}} {{straight}} to Sir Percy and left them. Half an hour later, he returned {{and told me that}} he had accepted <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> the full significance of the Nunc Dimittis. He asked me what he could now do to help and I sent him straight to the Naqib. The leading Shi'ah of Baghdad had also refused to join the Council and it was essential to get him in. In the midst of this talk Sir Percy sent for me. I left Sasun to Mr Philby and went to consult with Sir Percy. We agreed that I should send at once for Ja'far, tell him what had happened and bid him bestir himself. It was past one o'clock before I caught Ja'far. We had the most extraordinary conversation. He told me he had come into the Cabinet, only to defeat Talib, that he distrusted and loathed him and regarded it as shameful that he should be one of the leading persons of Mesopotamia. I said that the Mesopotamians themselves had made him, by their fear and their servility, and that it was for them to unmake him if they wished. We then discussed how to win over the extremists, I assured him that that was Sir Percy's chief desire and taking heart, he asked if he might talk to Sir Percy. I took him at once to Sir Percy and left them together, with the assured conviction that Sir Percy was the best exponent of his own policy.”… “Oh, if we can pull this thing off! rope together the young hotheads, and the Shi'ah obscurantists, and enthusiasts like Ja'far, polished old statesmen like Sasun, and scholars like Shukri—if we can make them work together and find their own salvation for themselves, what a fine thing it will be. I see visions and dream dreams. But as we say in Arabic countless times a day [...] "Through the presence of His Excellency the Representative of the King, and with the help of the Great Government, all please God, must be well!" ...|$|E
