In 1995 {{as a member}} of that group, she supported the action of a group of Somali women who denounced requests for sexual favors by the CGIL trade union in exchange for concessions in the allocation of food, but the CGIL denied the circumstances and Dacia Valent was found guilty of defamation after a Court trial. In April 1995 she was arrested for the attempted murder of Luc Tchombé Mutshail, a citizen of Zaire with whom she had a child; Tchombé was injured by Valent with a knife during a fight. Later in 2002, she was sanctioned by the Italian Comptroller and Auditor General for improper administration of the money invested from the Italian Government into SCORE which was meant instead to be used to build temporary sojourn and <b>assistance</b> <b>centres</b> for illegal immigrants.

Thanks {{to the spread}} of handheld hardware and software technology, such as PDAs (Personal Digital Assistant) and smartphones, wireless communication, TTS (Text To Speech) and database software for mobile devices, we were able to build a portable, easy to use orientation and navigation aid which still has great development possibilities. The cost effectiveness is due to the recovery of RFID identity tags used for tracing after cattle slaughtering: these tags are then burrowed to create the grid used for navigation. SesamoNet can also give the user environmental information such as nearby shops ’ names presence of steps or obstacles, bus stops, tube entrances or crossings.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{communication}} between Italian midwives and migrant patients, {{in which the}} midwives deal with the patients’ limited proficiency in Italian language. The paper presents a study conducted in two women’s health <b>assistance</b> <b>centres</b> in an Italian province, {{and is based on}} 7 hours of audiotaped and transcribed interactions between midwives and migrant patients during prenatal check-ups. The analysis concerns those actions in which the midwives (1) formulate patients’ previous utterances in order to check their own understanding and then provide explanations or continue their inquiry, and (2) reformulate their own utterances in order to solve explicit or expected problems of understanding on the part of patients. The paper illustrates how formulations and reformulations are used by midwives to try to overcome language barriers in healthcare interactions and give meanings to medical terms and patients’ health problems. The analysis shows that formulations and reformulations can enhance both a patient-centred form of communication and a form of midwives’ authority, discussing how these forms establish conditions and meanings of intercultural communication. An analysis of this kind can be useful to raise awareness and promote training among healthcare providers, particularly regarding situations and conditions of effective communication with migrant patients...|$|E
30|$|The {{analysis}} {{also includes}} variables {{at the level}} of the district where the individuals live (the sample comprises individuals living in 422 districts). As stressed in Lei et al. (2014), communities are institutions that can have important effects on their members, particularly on health outcomes. There is a large disparity in the level of socioeconomic development and infrastructure among Peruvian localities, and therefore, it is important to control for this heterogeneity when analysing health outcomes. The variables for the district are taken from the National Institute of Statistics and the 2012 National Registry of Municipalities (Registro Nacional de Municipalidades, RENAMU), which is a census of municipalities. We include the altitude of the district’s capital and the standard deviation from the district’s mean altitude of the altitude of village, as a measurement of elevation and terrain ruggedness, because these are the principal determinants of climate and crop choice in Peru (Dell 2010). With regard to infrastructure, we include the number of social <b>assistance</b> <b>centres,</b> hospitals and social centres for elderly individuals in the district, whether 50 % or more of the district’s capital households are covered by electricity and water networks and whether the district has a sewage system. Lastly, the official monetary poverty rate for the district in the period 2012 – 2013 is also included (INEI 2013).|$|E
