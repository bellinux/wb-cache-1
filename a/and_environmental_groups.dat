25|$|Even {{though many}} studies have been {{undertaken}} in this area, neither position has yet claimed a consensus view in the academic literature. Recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} direct rebound effects are significant (about 30% for energy), but that there is not enough information about indirect effects to know whether or how often back-fire occurs. Economists tend to the first position, but most governments, businesses, <b>and</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>groups</b> adhere to the second. Governments <b>and</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>groups</b> often advocate further research into fuel efficiency and radical increases in the efficient use of energy as the primary means for reducing energy use and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (to alleviate the impacts of climate change). However, if the first position more accurately reflects economic reality, current efforts to invent fuel-efficient technologies may not much reduce energy use, and may in fact paradoxically increase oil and coal consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions, over the long run.|$|E
25|$|Industry is {{the core}} force of oil sands development. The first major players, Suncor Energy and Syncrude, {{dominated}} the market until the 1990s.

25|$|Industrialisation of the Kurnell Peninsula {{continues}} to be an ongoing problem amongst community groups and environmentalists. Plans for further development at the site has been cause for continual public protest between developers, locals <b>and</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>groups.</b> A proposal to build a chemical plant by the German pharmaceutical company, Bayer in 1986 resulted in public protests, environmental objections and a Commission of Inquiry, chaired by John Woodward. The plan never went ahead on the grounds of both environmental and economic issues.|$|E
25|$|The 1992 {{campaign}} also {{marked the}} entry of Ralph Nader into presidential politics as a candidate.

As a result, several thousand Democrats and Republicans wrote-in Nader's name. Despite supporting mostly liberal legislation during his career as a consumer advocate, Nader received more votes from Republicans than Democrats.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the initial}} {{approval}} of the system from the public, local and national government, <b>and</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>groups,</b> Metrolink {{has become something of}} a victim of its own popularity. Many routes are extremely busy, especially at peak times, and prices have risen at far above the rate of inflation. The network has also gained a reputation for being somewhat unreliable.

Prominent NSRL supporters include former Governor Michael S. Dukakis (Democrat) and former Governor William F. Weld (Republican), who have made joint public appearances regarding this issue. Based on their advocacy, MassDOT agreed to fund a $2 million study in February 2016.|$|E

After all, those with an interest in a single land use decision could include petroleum producers, Aboriginal communities, landowners, farmers, ranchers, loggers, trappers, campers, sports <b>and</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>groups,</b> and others.

In May 2008, under a court order, the EPA lowered its ozone standard from 80 nmol/mol to 75 nmol/mol. The move proved controversial, since the Agency's own scientists and advisory board had recommended lowering the standard to 60 nmol/mol. Many public health <b>and</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>groups</b> also supported the 60 nmol/mol standard, and the World Health Organization recommends 51 nmol/mol.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} plan for Trump International Golf Links, Scotland (TIGLS) included two 18-hole courses, a 5-star hotel, golf villas, holiday homes, and a golf academy. It was strongly supported by local business leaders but met opposition from local residents, campaigners <b>and</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>groups</b> anxious {{to preserve the}} 4,000-year-old sand dunes that are designated an SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). Though recommended for approval by Aberdeenshire Council officials the development was initially rejected by a local subcommittee of elected members. However it was subsequently approved following a controversial planning inquiry ordered by the Scottish Government in June 2008, at which Trump personally testified. Work began on the site in July 2010.|$|E

25|$|The {{high-rise}} {{buildings of}} Brooklyn constitute a third, much smaller skyline. The high-rise buildings in downtown Brooklyn are centered around a major NYC subway hub. Downtown Brooklyn is also experiencing an extensive building boom, with new high rise luxury residential towers, commercial {{space and a}} new arena in the planning stages. The building boom in Brooklyn has {{had a great deal}} of opposition from local civic <b>and</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>groups</b> which contend that Brooklyn needs to maintain its human scale. The borough of Queens has also been developing its own skyline in recent years with a Citigroup office building (which is currently the tallest building in NYC outside Manhattan), and the Queens West development of several residential towers along the East River waterfront.|$|E
25|$|Extensive {{upgrades}} over {{a recent}} eighteen-month interval {{have addressed the}} life safety issues, including replacement of the football players' facilities, and an extensive seismic retrofit of those sections not subject to fault shearing. The work {{was the subject of}} several lawsuits from neighborhood <b>and</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>groups,</b> who were concerned about such extensive construction on top of a major fault. During the reconstruction, the Cal Bears have played at AT Park in San Francisco for one season. The modifications completed in Summer 2012 involved the cutting of the stadium into four independent sections, followed by the demolition of the two segments directly over the rubble zone. The north and south ends are formed of new bridging sections that rest upon floating mats (foundations that do not penetrate the surface, rather sitting upon plastic sheets over level graded gravel and sand) where they pass over and near the fault, with appropriate sliding connections between the sections for the safety of spectators and the ability to absorb the relative rotation between the east and west fixed sections and the new north and south mobile sections.|$|E
