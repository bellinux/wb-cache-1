40|$|Abstract. The <b>Aircraft</b> <b>mass</b> {{estimation}} and {{the associated}} 'balancing ' of the layout {{are two of the}} main decision areas in the project phase of the design. The initial crude 'guesstimates ' at the aircraft take-off weight will be progressively refined as more details of the aircraft configuration and systems are settled. How the mass estimation process is progressed and how details of the configuration and systems are related to the total <b>aircraft</b> <b>mass</b> is discussed. After an initial explanation of the factors which affect mass, a simplified method to determine the first estimate of aircraft take-off mass is presented together with an example calculation. A more detailed mass estimation method is then described together with formulae and expressions to predict each of the main components of the aircraft. After this, the items is list in a standardized mass statement for the aircraft. The form of this list is described and the various sub-groupings is shown...|$|E

40|$|<b>Aircraft</b> <b>mass</b> is {{a crucial}} piece of {{information}} for studies on aircraft performance, trajectory prediction, and many other ATM topics. However, {{it is a common}} challenge for researchers who have no access to this proprietary information. Previously, several studies have proposed methods to estimates aircraft weight, most of which are focused on specific parts of the flight. Often due to inaccurate input data or biased assumptions, a significant number of estimates can result outside of the weight limitation boundaries. This paper proposes an approach that makes use of multiple observations to get a better estimate for a complete flight. By looking at flight data from a complete trajectory and calculating <b>aircraft</b> <b>mass</b> at different flight phases based on different methods, together with fuel flow models, multiple observations of aircraft initial mass can then be derived. Using the Bayesian inference method, final estimates can be made with a higher level of confidence. Control & Simulatio...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} the {{estimation}} of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>mass</b> in ground-based applications. Mass is a key parameter for climb prediction.

There is hope that the <b>aircraft</b> <b>mass</b> might become widely available someday, {{but in the meantime}} it is possible to estimate an equivalent mass from the data already available, assuming the thrust to be known (maximum or reduced climb thrust for example). In a previous paper ([1]), two mass estimation methods were compared using simulated data. In this paper, we compare these two mass estimation methods using Mode-C radar data. Both methods estimate the <b>aircraft</b> <b>mass</b> by fitting the modeled energy rate (i. e. the power of the forces acting on the aircraft) with the energy rate observed at several points of the past trajectory. The first method, proposed by Schultz et al. ([2]), dynamically adjusts the weight parameter so as to fit the energy rate, using an adaptive sensitivity parameter to weight each observation. The second method, introduced in one of our previous publications ([1]), estimates the mass by minimizing the quadratic error on the observed energy rate, taking advantage of the polynomial expression of the modeled power when using the BADA model. The actual mass is unavailable in our radar data. However, we can use the estimated mass to compute a trajectory prediction. This prediction is then compared to the actual trajectory giving us some insight on the accuracy of the estimated mass. We have compared the obtained predictions with the ones obtained using the BADA reference mass. The root mean square error on the predicted altitude is reduced by 45 % using the least squares method.

30|$|The VarMission {{software}} considers taxiing on the ground, take-off, climb, {{cruise and}} descent flight phases. The fuel consumption of a flight is calculated iteratively, reducing the <b>aircraft</b> <b>mass</b> (due to fuel burn) in each calculation step. Since the take-off mass of a flight is initially unknown, the program performs the calculation process “backwards”, i.e. starting with the aircraft’s empty weight plus payload, considering reserve fuel quantities and analysing all flight phases in reverse order. The flight distance of each flight was estimated by applying an empirical “inefficiency” factor to the great-circle distance between origin and destination airports. The factor ranges from 1.06 on short-range flights (up to 500  km) to around 1.03 on long-range missions.|$|E
