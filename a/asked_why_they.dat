5|$|For the 2009 remake, {{stuntman}} Derek Mears {{was hired}} to portray Jason Voorhees at the recommendation of makeup special effects supervisor Scott Stoddard. Mears's pleasant demeanor had the studio worried {{about his ability to}} portray such a menacing character on screen, but Mears assured them {{he would be able to}} perform the role. When Mears auditioned for the role he was <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> should hire an actor over just another guy in a mask. As Mears explained, portraying Jason is similar to Greek mask work, where the mask and the actor are two separate entities, and, based on the scene, there will be various combinations of mask and actor in the performance.|$|E
25|$|According to a Gallup Poll taken February 911 2007, {{responders}} {{who supported}} Giuliani were <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> supported him. The {{results showed that}} 13% of supporters did so because of Giuliani's strong leadership and 53% did so because of leadership related topics such as time as mayor and handling of 9/11. Another poll taken by Marist showed that 42% of Giuliani supporters believed that leadership {{is the most important}} quality for a candidate, compared to 34% of McCain supporters who believed the same.|$|E
25|$|The Crathie was a steamer {{of about}} 475 tons gross and 272 net. She left Rotterdam with general cargo for Aberdeen on January 29, 1895 {{carrying}} just 12 hands. The Craithie was also badly damaged in the collision {{and returned to}} Rotterdam flying signals of distress. When later <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> had not stayed on to help the Elbe and her passengers, the captain, Alexander Gordon, said that he feared that his ship would sink, {{and in any case}} he did not hear any cries for help coming from the liner. It appeared to him that the Elbe was steaming away from his position.|$|E

25|$|The social {{sharing of}} {{emotions}} {{is an important}} source of interpersonal interaction, social integration, and forming positive and durable relationships. In fact, many people engage in sharing behaviors in order to have such social interactions and strengthen their relationships (as described above). However, this might not result from the sharing of certain emotional events. When <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> would keep an emotional event a secret, the most frequent reasons cited were: wanting to avoid hurting someone, preserving one’s image in the eyes of others, protecting one’s private life, and protecting one’s self. Such reasons, which together constituted the responses of over 75% of participants, all concern one thing: protection. According to Baumeister and Leary, this idea of protection pertains to protection from undesirable consequences {{in the realm of the}} social sphere, namely that the revelation of such secrets would be harmful to social relationships. Therefore, instead of social integration and the strengthening of relationships, the revelation of certain emotional events could be harmful to a relationship and could thus result in social disintegration and deterioration of relationships.|$|E
25|$|Schur {{found himself}} lonely after {{the flight of}} many of his {{students}} and the expulsion of renowned scientists from his previous place of work. Only Dr. Helmut Grunsky had been friendly to him, as Schur reported in the late thirties to his expatriate student Max Menachem Schiffer. The Gestapo was everywhere. Since Schur had announced to his wife his intentions to commit suicide in case of a summons to the Gestapo, in the summer of 1938 his wife took his letters, and with them a summons from the Gestapo, sent Issai Schur to a relaxing stay in a home outside of Berlin and went with medical certificate allowing her to meet the Gestapo in place of her husband. There they flatly <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> were still staying in Germany. But there were economic obstacles to the planned emigration : Emigrating Germans had a pre-departure Reich Flight Tax to pay, which was a quarter of their assets. Now Schur's wife had inherited a mortgage on a house in Lithuania, which because of the Lithuanian foreign exchange determination could not be repaid. On the other hand, Schur was forbidden to default or leave the mortgage to the German Reich. Thus the Schurs lacked cash and cash equivalents. Finally, the missing sum of money was somehow supplied, and to this day {{it does not seem to}} be clear who were the donors.|$|E

Wyman stated they {{were more interested in}} consequences, such as the repercussions of having both Olivias back in their own worlds. Pinkner explained, [...] "We're always more interested in the 'And then what?' After 'Entrada,' what are the consequences of what we witnessed for the first eight episodes?

[...] However, the Cayuse party was imprisoned and transported to Oregon City. When the group was <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> offered themselves to the militia, Tiloukaikt stated [...] "Did not your missionaries teach us that Christ died to save his people? So die we to save our people." [...] At a military court Tiloukait and the four other Cayuses, Tomahas, Klokamas, Isaiachalkis, and Kimasumpkinhese, were found guilty and hanged on June 3, 1850, at Oregon City.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{recording}} session, Hanton {{had a fight}} {{with the rest of}} the group and quit. Lowe too lost contact with the group after leaving Liverpool Institute, leaving the Quarrymen as just a trio of guitarists: Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. Lennon's mother was killed in a road accident on 15 July 1958, dealing him a devastating emotional blow. The group remained mostly inactive throughout the summer, as Lennon took up a job in a restaurant at the Liverpool Airport. McCartney and Harrison, meanwhile, went on holiday hitchhiking in Wales, playing with a local skiffle group called the Vikings. Although Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison remained extremely close, the trio only performed a handful of times in the last months of 1958. When <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> had neither a drummer or a bass player, they would respond [...] "The rhythm's in the guitars." ...|$|E
500|$|Brown and {{his wife}} Phyllis {{separated}} in August 1995. Phyllis filed for divorce in Kentucky in 1996, but withdrew the petition amid settlement talks with her husband. After Brown reportedly cut off much of his wife's financial support, she filed a second divorce petition in 1997, this time in Broward County, Florida where her husband was living at the time. After a brief legal fight over whether the proceedings should take place in Kentucky or Florida, the divorce became final in 1998. Later that year, he married former Mrs. Kentucky Jill Louise Roach, 27 years his junior, but they divorced in 2003 for reasons not released. When <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> divorced he stated [...] "I do have great love for Jill, but something which cannot be overlooked has come up in our marriage. I will always love her and her children, but it seems a divorce is our only option now." ...|$|E

500|$|The United States, in this case, {{decided not}} to turn Brown over to the Japanese {{authorities}} before he was formally indicted and restricted Brown to base on Camp Courtney. [...] On December 9, the JNP filed formal charges against Brown and, on December 19, he was formally indicted on charges of attempted rape and destruction of private property. [...] The next day, Brown, escorted by U.S. Marine Corps military police, {{was turned over to}} the custody of Japanese police at the Naha detention center. [...] When <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> had waited ten days after the formal charges to indict Brown, Japanese Deputy Chief Prosecutor Junichi Okumura stated that they wanted to give Brown a chance to apologize (called jidan in Japanese) to the victim. [...] Since that apparently did not occur and V. N. still expressed a desire to press charges, the Japanese authorities went ahead with the indictment.|$|E
500|$|As July {{approached}} {{and came to}} its close, Tancredo's standing improved somewhat with the looming Ames Straw Poll. His strategy to focus on Iowa continued, {{and the number of}} grassroots supporters in the state increased. On July 31, the campaign developed an interesting new strategy, offering a trip to Washington, D.C. and a tour of the capitol to anyone who brought 25 Tancredo supporters to the straw poll. On the day before, supporters in Iowa distributed T-shirts which read [...] "I'm a Member of Tom's Army Against Amnesty." [...] Interviewed supporters were <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> supported the candidate, they replied, [...] "He really has the concerns of America at heart, he's concerned about the culture of America itself. What's happening to the bedrock of American culture." [...] Tancredo finished in fourth place at the Ames Straw poll with over 14% of the vote. It was won by former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.|$|E
500|$|After having long denied foreign media {{access to}} the {{self-immolation}} victims, in April 2002 the Government arranged for foreign press to interview the purported survivors of the self-immolation {{in the presence of}} state officials. The interviewees refuted claims that the self-immolation was staged, showing their burn injuries as evidence, and denounced Falun Gong while expressing support for the authorities' handling of the group. When <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> set themselves on fire, Hao Huijun replied that she had realised the futility of writing letters and demonstrating by waving banners, [...] "so finally, we decided... to make a big event to show our will to the world.... We wanted to show the government that Falun Gong was good." [...] At the time of the interview, Chen Guo and her mother were said to still be in the hospital, both having lost their hands, ears and noses. Both her mother's eyes were covered with skin grafts.

500|$|On {{the night}} of 11 April, Lennon, Harrison and Mardas sat up late {{discussing}} their views of the Maharishi and {{decided to leave the}} next morning. They packed hurriedly, while Mardas went to Dehradun to find taxis. Lennon was chosen to speak to the Maharishi. When <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> were leaving, Lennon replied [...] "If you're so cosmic, you'll know why". Paul Mason, a biographer of the Maharishi, later interpreted Lennon's statement as a challenge to the Maharishi's claim of cosmic consciousness. Lennon said that his mind was made up when the Maharishi gave him a murderous look in response. According to Mardas: [...] "John Lennon and I went to the Maharishi about what had happened... he asked the Maharishi to explain himself"; and the Maharishi answered Lennon's accusation by saying, [...] "I am only human". But Lennon said he was [...] "a bit rough to him" [...] and the Maharishi responded by saying [...] "I don't know why, you must tell me." [...] While waiting for Mardas to return, Lennon wrote the song [...] "Maharishi", which was later renamed [...] "Sexy Sadie" [...] because Harrison advised Lennon that was potentially libellous. According to Harrison, Lennon [...] "had wanted to leave anyway" [...] and this gave him a [...] "good reason to get out." ...|$|E
500|$|Trouble struck when Marty Katz {{was sent}} to New Zealand. Spending four months there, he told Miramax that the films {{were more likely to}} cost $150million, and with Miramax unable to finance this, and with $15million already spent, they decided to merge the two films into one. On 17 June 1998, Bob Weinstein {{presented}} a treatment of a single two-hour film version of the book. He suggested cutting Bree and the Battle of Helm's Deep, [...] "losing or using" [...] Saruman, merging Rohan and Gondor with Éowyn as Boromir's sister, shortening Rivendell and Moria as well as having Ents prevent the Uruk-hai from kidnapping Merry and Pippin. Upset by the idea of [...] "cutting out half the good stuff" [...] Jackson balked, and Miramax declared that any script or work completed by Weta Workshop was theirs. Jackson went around Hollywood for four weeks, showing a thirty-five-minute video of their work, before meeting with New Line Cinema's Mark Ordesky. At New Line Cinema, Robert Shaye viewed the video, and then <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> were making two films when the book was published as three volumes (this was later corrected: New Line only made this choice out of economical reasons); he wanted to make a film trilogy. Now Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens had to write three new scripts.|$|E
500|$|When {{choosing}} {{candidates for}} the Tatsunoko and Capcom character rosters, the development team was free to nominate any character it wished. However, the team faced limitations on its Tatsunoko candidates; Niitsuma explained, [...] " [...] had to consider licensing issues. Once we had that list we {{had to figure out}} how to make a balanced fighting game. On top of that we wanted a good balance between male and female characters." [...] Selection emphasis was placed on main characters, rather than on villains. Certain characters were denied by Tatsunoko Production without explanation to Capcom. [...] "We weren't privy to a lot of their decision making process. They didn't share a lot of reasons with us. When they said no and we <b>asked</b> <b>why,</b> <b>they</b> wouldn't tell us, but would give us another suggestion," [...] Niitsuma said. They disallowed characters from Genesis Climber MOSPEADA or Samurai Pizza Cats, despite the high number of fan requests for the latter. The eponymous characters of Tatsunoko's Muteking, The Dashing Warrior and Nurse Witch Komugi were among those planned for inclusion, but were eventually scrapped. The finalized Tatsunoko cast consists of characters that the team enjoyed in their youth. The development team hoped to include Capcom's Phoenix Wright and Franziska von Karma from the Ace Attorney series, but, while the latter's use of a whip made her easy to incorporate, the team struggled to find appropriate attacks for Phoenix. Since Phoenix doesn't move from the waist down in his original game environment, the team considered adding tires to his desk and having the entirety move as a single character. However, this was abandoned due to potential collision issues. Though they envisioned an attack that used his catch-phrase [...] "", with the letters themselves used to attack the opponent, they found that localization would have changed the Japanese four-character phrase (in kanji) to a ten-letter word in English, unbalancing the game. Arthur from Ghosts 'n Goblins, and Ingrid from Capcom Fighting Evolution were also scrapped.|$|E
