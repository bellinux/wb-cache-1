25|$|Ahalyoddharaṇam (Sanskrit: अहल्योद्धरणम्). Janaka fixes {{the day of}} Sītā's Svayaṃvara after {{counseling}} {{with his}} ministers and priests. Meanwhile, in Ayodhyā, Daśaratha starts thinking about Rāma's marriage. The sage Viśvāmitra is interrupted <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> his sacrifice by the female demon Tāṭakā. Viśvāmitra arrives in Daśaratha's court and asks for Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa for protecting his sacrifice from demons. Daśaratha is reluctant and desolate {{at the thought of}} Rāma leaving him, but Vasiṣṭha convinces him to relent. Viśvāmitra takes Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to his forest where Rāma kills Tāṭakā when she attacks the three by raining trees and rocks at them. Viśvāmitra grants the two Vidyās names Balā and Atibalā to Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, which will enable them to survive without drinking, eating or sleeping. Viśvāmitra also surrenders all his divine weapons to Rāma. Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa protect the sacrifice of Viśvāmitra for six days and six nights. On the seventh day, the demon brothers Mārīca and Subāhu attack the sacrifice with a large army. Rāma uses the Mānavāstra to throw the elder brother Mārīca across the ocean, while he burns Subāhu to death by the Āgneyāstra. In the meantime Lakṣmaṇa kills the entire army of demons. Viśvāmitra is freed from the fear of demons and decides to take Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to Mithilā for the Svayaṃvara of Sītā. On the way, Rāma sights Ahalyā, who has been cursed by her husband Gautama for her adulterous transgression, {{in the form of a}} rock. Viśvāmitra narrates the history of Ahalyā to Rāma. Rāma touches Ahalyā by his foot and Ahalyā is freed of her curse and sin. Ahalyā praises Rāma with tears in her eyes and departs to the abode of Gautama.|$|E

500|$|<b>Again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> her writings, {{speeches and}} interviews, Ursula Franklin insists that war and its {{violence}} {{are not only}} morally wrong, but also ineffective, impractical, and costly. During a radio interview broadcast {{two days after the}} September 11 attacks in the U.S., Franklin argued that violence nowadays is always unsuccessful even for the powerful who try to use it. [...] "Nothing has been resolved by violence over the past fifty years," [...] Franklin said. [...] "The rational thinking that force does not work, even for the enforcer, is staring us in the face." [...] In a newspaper article published just before the first anniversary of 9/11, Franklin wrote, [...] "It is crucial to recognize that war and war measures are fundamentally dysfunctional instruments of problem-solving. Violence begets more violence, war begets further wars, more enemies and more suffering." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{two sides}} to Poulenc's musical nature caused {{misunderstanding}} during his life and have continued to do so. The composer Ned Rorem observed, [...] "He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested {{in the works of}} younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, [...] "Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez's Le marteau sans maître with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today." [...] Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, [...] "There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after Sacre [...] It was not progress." [...] Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: [...] "You are truly good, and that is what I find <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> your music".|$|E

[...] This painting's patron was likely Sir Christopher Hatton (his heraldic badge of the white hind appears on the sleeve of one of the courtiers in the background), and the work may express opposition to the proposed marriage of Elizabeth to François, Duke of Anjou.|$|E

2500|$|... "The try Australia scored {{towards the}} end of the first half was relayed {{endlessly}} on television and, I predict, will be shown <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> years to come. It was Lynagh, running towards the blind side, who set things in motion. Noticing that the New Zealand backs were lined up flat, he chipped the ball into the gap behind the winger. The New Zealand fullback, Kieran Crowley, was regarded by the Australians as being a little slow off the mark, and no doubt Lynagh had this in mind when he chose to kick in front of him. Campese was bearing down on the ball, and I think Crowley was undecided whether to go in for the ball or wait for the bounce and try to stop Campese. His slight hesitation gave Campese the fraction of a second he needed to scoop up the ball and flash past him. Campese's running then was superb. He drew two defenders and had a third one chasing him, all of whom thought he was a threat. Campese saw Tim Horan behind him out of the corner of his eye and flipped the ball back over his shoulder. Horan did well to catch it before going on to score." ...|$|E
2500|$|The other cult {{leader was}} Sara Aldrete, a honors student and {{cheerleader}} at Texas Southmost College. She was the girlfriend of Gilberto Sosa, {{a drug dealer}} linked to the Hernández clan that Constanzo wanted an introduction to. In 1987, she met Constanzo and eventually became the cult's main recruiter. Investigators believed that Aldrete's physical attractiveness and charm helped her lure men to join the cult or to set them up to get abducted and killed. [...] She recruited people by first showing them the 1987 thriller film The Believers, which was about a New York City-based cult that practiced human sacrifice for money and influence. Constanzo's members were forced to see the film <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> order to indoctrinate them to the necessity of human sacrifice. Students and teachers at her college in Brownsville recalled her as a friendly and studious physical education student who {{showed no signs of}} abnormal behavior or involvement with a religious cult. Across the border in Matamoros, however, Aldrete was involved in drug smuggling operations and in cult activities. Some of her former classmates found it suspicious that she drove a 1989 vehicle with an embedded telephone, while others recall she preferred to dress in black. Investigators believed that her proximity to the U.S.-Mexico border allowed for Aldrete to keep her two lives separate for years. Because of her contradictory lifestyle, law enforcement believed that Aldrete was living a double life and showed signs and symptoms of having a multiple personality disorder.|$|E
