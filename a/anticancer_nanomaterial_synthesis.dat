40|$|International audienceIn {{the current}} context of {{conventional}} fossil resource depletion, {{global warming and}} rising waste, thermal plasma appears as an interesting alternative compared to conventional thermochemical processes (combustion, gasification, pyrolysis, cracking…) {{in the fields of}} energy and <b>nanomaterial</b> <b>synthesis.</b> The particular processing conditions due to thermal plasma (i. e. high temperatures and high enthalpy densities) allow using raw materials with Low Heating Value such as organic wastes (dried sewage sludge, plastics, used tires, sawdust…) or biomass (liquid, solid or gaseous) in the fields of energy and <b>nanomaterial</b> <b>synthesis.</b> This paper reviews the last developments of a 3 -phase AC plasma technology for the treatment of domiciliary and industrial wastes for <b>nanomaterial</b> <b>synthesis,</b> particularly the preliminary results reached for the production of carbon blacks and fullerenes from thermochemical processing by plasma of plastics (HDPE pellets) and carbon black soot resulting from tire pyrolysis.

40|$|Solution-based {{chemical}} <b>synthesis</b> of <b>nanomaterials</b> has a {{long history}} and has dominated the nanosphere with established protocols for synthesizing particles with excellent control over shape, size, and properties. With the development of chemical methods, the concern for a negative impact on the environment is also heightened. This has led scientists to develop "green" environment friendly routes for <b>nanomaterials</b> <b>synthesis.</b> Interestingly, nature has evolved numerous strategies for fabricating materials at the nanoscale through elegant and artistic ways that show high level of hierarchical ordering. One of such strategies evolved in nature is the important role of microbes in bioremediation. Microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, algae, and plants are known for their inherent ability to withstand high concentrations of toxic metal ions through specific resistance mechanisms and therefore these are commonly employed toward remediation of different metal ions. Conversely relatively few organisms are known to produce nanomaterials in their natural habitats with examples including accumulation of gold in algal and bacterial cells, magnetite in magnetotactic bacteria, ZnS in sulfate reducing bacteria, etc. Although, these biological organisms are known for withstanding high concentrations of metal ions, the possibility of deliberately exploring these microbes as "nano-factories" (similar to the commercially applied fermentation technology that is now used for large-scale synthesis of enzymes, drugs, etc.) for <b>nanomaterials</b> <b>synthesis</b> is a recent phenomenon. A great deal of work has been performed in this emerging area of bionanotechnology with organisms like bacteria, fungi, and plants being regularly employed for the synthesis {{of a wide variety of}} nanomaterials ranging from metals and metal oxides to metal sulfides.

We have revealed that nanocatalyst size can be rationally tailored by adjusting the interaction between copper precursors and ligands and metal sequestration time. Ordered arrays of copper nanocatalysts derived from depositing a monolayer of solution micelles exhibit excellent thermal stability and do not agglomerate during the thermal treatment at 850 °C, typical growth temperature for 1 D nanomaterial using the chemical vapor deposition technique. High-density and aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes with uniform diameter have been synthesized using the chemical vapor deposition technique. The average diameter is 1. 4 nm, {{which is on the}} same order of catalyst size, around 2. 0 nm. The combination of tunable size and spacing with superb thermal stability and outstanding catalytic activity offered by this new copper nanocatalyst system will enable growth of high-yield 1 D nanomaterials with controllable diameter and spacing consistently and reproducible properties.
