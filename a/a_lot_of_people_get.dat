5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{installation}} of electricity in the village, residents began calling {{for the construction of}} a primary school. Mohit Kumar, a resident of Kashyap Colony, was quoted in a Times of India article addressing the issue, saying:"There seems to be a consensus in the village that we should demand a school after we get power lines running here. Not <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>get</b> to send their children to school. Children have to either go to Kanshi village, which is two kilometers away, or to Partapur town, which is around five kilometers away. This may not seem like a big distance to us, but it is considerable distance for primary school kids. Besides, there aren't enough schools for us since the village has a population of over 2,000 people here. There should at least be a primary school here."Pankaj Sharma of Meerut Nagrik Adhikar Manch (MNAM), a Meerut-based NGO, spoke of the ongoing effort to petition the local government:"It is good to see that the wires are being laid out in the village for the first time ever. It looks like they will have power by Diwali, maybe even before. This was a basic right of the villagers which they should have gotten long ago. Just like electricity, education too is a basic right. The village does not have a single school. Now that the villagers are more aware of their rights, they are also demanding a school. Villagers have said they even have space for a school here. We will meet officials soon and put this demand forward. Earlier, authorities ignored the people here but now they are forced to listen. That is because they are united and more organized than before." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "On My Own" [...] {{was written}} by Yasmin, Ian Greenidge and its {{producer}} Andre Williams, {{who goes by the}} stage name of Shy FX. Yasmin's DJ'ing experience enriched her with A&R knowledge which allowed her to choose and meet up with Shy FX to produce [...] "On My Own". She knew Shy FX from her time as a DJ and was a fan of his work, and later phoned him for a studio session. Speaking to Alex Andrews of Gigwise, Yasmin elaborated on her love for Shy FX's production style, [...] "I don't have to say much to him, he just knows exactly what to do." [...] She was then signed to Levels Entertainment and Ministry of Sound on 1 April 2010. She then achieved her first commercial success when she featured on Devlin's 2010 single [...] "Runaway", which peaked at number 15 on the UK Singles Chart. Inspired by these events leading up to the launch of her solo career, Yasmin wrote [...] "On My Own". The song was very personal to Yasmin as it represented her journey in the music industry. Writing about the independence themes of the song, Semper Azeez-Harris of Blues & Soul mentioned that Yasmin's path was not followed by the formulaic [...] "I {{always wanted to be a}} singer" [...] mould, adding, [...] "Whilst a love for music is the prerequisite for wanting to be a singer the fact that she chose the male dominated world of DJ'ing initially as a way to satiate that love of music, epitomises her independence streak." [...] Speaking to Azeez-Harris, Yasmin explained how she was constantly patronised when DJ-ing, [...] "In a lot of scenarios I have been at gigs where people have not heard me before but once I get on the decks people cannot tell me that I do not deserve to be on there." [...] She was also inspired by music of the 1990s during the song's development, naming Massive Attack, Madonna and All Saints as some of the acts which influenced the track. In the Daily Record report, Yasmin mentioned, [...] "1990s was a really cool time, with a lot of mood and vibe in the music, recently a lot music is very samey, it's nice to be able to go back to a mood and groove." [...] She wanted [...] "On My Own" [...] to be [...] "fresh but familiar, new school but old school." [...] Her experience as a DJ in Glasgow is manifested in the song's lyrics. One particular experience was explained by Yasmin, [...] "Because of being there I was not fazed by the flashy London business - champagne, footballers and models, ... you did it because you loved it but here <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>get</b> into it because they wanted that lifestyle." [...] Speaking to Live Magazine, Yasmin said that [...] "On My Own" [...] is about being brave, taking risks, looking after yourself and making things happen for yourself. She added: [...] "I think when someone is fine being on their own and being in their own company that's strong. My friend's mum always used to stay stuff to us, because my friend is a stylist and I was doing what I was doing so we would message each other and be like oh my god I'm just sitting for lunch on my own - how embarrassing but my friend's mum would say it takes a very strong person to sit in a restaurant on their own." [...] The bulk of the parent album for [...] "On My Own" [...] shares its theme of independence.|$|E
