5|$|Coakley {{summed up}} his {{prosecution}} case on September 22. His {{aim was to}} show the court that <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> had taken placethe mass of accounts from officers and men appeared to support the conclusion that ringleaders and agitators had forced a rebellion against authority. Veltmann pointed out that few of the accused had been ordered to load ammunition, meaning {{that they could not}} all be guilty of the charge of disobeying orders. Veltmann stressed that much of the testimony was hearsay and failed to establish <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> or a mutiny. The court, however, seemed to side with Coakley on all points, settling each objection in favor of the prosecution.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the law of}} tort, {{the legal}} {{elements}} necessary to establish <b>a</b> civil <b>conspiracy</b> are substantially {{the same as for}} establishing <b>a</b> criminal <b>conspiracy,</b> i.e. there is an agreement between two or more natural persons to break the law at some time in the future or to achieve a lawful aim by unlawful means. The criminal law often requires one of the conspirators to take an overt step to accomplish the illegal act to demonstrate the reality of their intention to break the law, whereas in <b>a</b> civil <b>conspiracy,</b> <b>an</b> overt act towards accomplishing the wrongful goal may not be required. Etymologically, the term comes from Latin con- [...] "with, together", and spirare [...] "to breathe".|$|R

5|$|There is no need, under Churchill v Walton, to {{show that}} the conspirators knew that their {{proposed}} course of conduct amounted to a crime, but they must have intended the consequences; if two people conspire to put poison in the victim's tea, this is not <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> to murder unless the poison was intended to kill the victim. The defendants will similarly not be found guilty if they are unaware that a crime will result; if two people agree to grow plants, unaware that the plants are illegal, they have not engaged in <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy.</b> On the other hand, if the two people believe the plants to be illegal even though they are not, they could be found guilty.|$|E

This caused Calhoun to believe that Jackson had approved the publication of the letters. Calhoun published them in the Telegraph. This gave the appearance of Calhoun trying to justify himself against <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> to damage him, and further enraged the President.|$|E
