ENGLISH ABSTRACT: In {{this study}} investors were {{informed}} {{of the benefits of}} diversification and the reduction of systematic risk when property is included in an asset allocation portfolio. It also provided investors with information that will assist them in deciding on asset class allocations, specifically including real estate within a mixed-asset portfolio for both the short and long term. The method applied to answer the research questions started with a detailed literature review in order to gain a thorough understanding of the topic. The second part involved a quantitative approach. The South African Property Index (SAPI), All Share Index (ALSI) and All Bond Index (ALBI) total returns were analysed using descriptive statistics in order to gain knowledge about the return (mean) and risk (standard deviation) performances of the three asset data series. The final part analysed the allocation weights of assets in a mixed portfolio to determine the optimal portfolio weights to either reduce risk or enhance returns. It was found for the period under review that property quarterly returns outperformed equity and bonds. The compound annual growth rate for the period was calculated and it was found that property had a growth rate of 26. 1 per cent, equity a growth rate of 17. 9 per cent and bonds a growth rate of 10. 9 per cent. The risk rate for property was also determined and it was higher than for equity and bonds. The study also found a correlation between bonds and properties, meaning that <b>adding</b> <b>bonds</b> to a real estate portfolio would not give much diversification benefit. Equity to bonds had a negative correlation, showing diversification benefits of <b>adding</b> <b>bonds</b> to an equity portfolio. However, equity to property had a low correlation, meaning that adding property to an equity portfolio would reduce portfolio risk and increase returns. Should an investor not want to be exposed to more risk than simply holding one asset, namely bonds, a portfolio gives substantially higher returns without increasing the risk The study also observed the changes in the asset class returns during certain economic activities. Bonds were found to be the most resistant of the three asset classes and equity the most affected...|$|R

40|$|Many {{properties}} of disordered materials {{can be understood}} by looking at idealized structural models, in which the strain is as small as is possible {{in the absence of}} long-range order. For covalent amorphous semiconductors and glasses, such an idealized structural model, the continuous-random network, was introduced 70 years ago by Zachariasen. In this model, each atom is placed in a crystal-like local environment, with perfect coordination and chemical ordering, yet longer-range order is nonexistent. Defects, such as missing or <b>added</b> <b>bonds,</b> or chemical mismatches, however, are not accounted for. In this paper we explore under which conditions the idealized CRN model without defects captures the {{properties of}} the material, and under which conditions defects are an inherent part of the idealized model. We find that the density of defects in tetrahedral networks does not vary smoothly with variations in the interaction strengths, but jumps from close-to-zero to a finite density. Consequently, in certain materials, defects do not play a role except for being thermodynamical excitations, whereas in others they are a fundamental ingredient of the ideal structure.

At MP 2 level, the largest basis set used with a bond function (denoted aug-cc-pVDZf- 6 s 6 p 4 d 2 f) differs by only ∼ 0. 1 kcal/mol relative to the result obtained from the standard aug-cc-pVQZ basis calculation (without the bond function). The calculated potential energy curves from the bond function basis aug-cc-pVDZf- 6 s 6 p 4 d 2 f and the larger standard basis aug-cc-pVTZ are in excellent agreement with each other for all three configurations. The number of bond function basis aug-cc-pVDZf- 6 s 6 p 4 d 2 f is 526 compared to 828 of aug-cc-pVTZ and 1512 of aug-cc-pVQZ.

40|$|The tubulin homolog FtsZ is {{the major}} cytoskeletal protein in {{bacterial}} cytokinesis. It can generate a constriction force on the bacterial membrane or inside tubular liposomes. Several models have recently been proposed for how this force might be generated. These fall into 2 categories. The first {{is based on a}} conformational change from a straight to a curved protofilament. The simplest “hydrolyze and bend” model proposes a 22 ° bend at every interface containing a GDP. New evidence suggests another curved conformation with a 2. 5 ° bend at every interface and that the relation of curvature to GTP hydrolysis is more complicated than previously thought. However, FtsZ protofilaments do appear to be mechanically rigid enough to bend membranes. A second category of models is based on lateral bonding between protofilaments, postulating that a contraction could be generated when protofilaments slide {{to increase the number of}} lateral bonds.

He finds that M 2 B (M 2 plus bond funds) and M 2 + (M 2 plus bond and stock funds) are statistically significant in explaining past nominal GDP growth. Duca further shows that M 2 B and M 2 + each yield better forecasts of nominal GDP growth since 1990 than does M 2, but {{to a lesser extent}} when the federal funds rate and the ten-year Treasury note yield are included in his forecasting model. Because bond and equity mutual funds are less directly influenced by the Federal Reserve than M 2, Duca cautions that, relative to M 2, M 2 B and M 2 + are likely to be less controllable by the Federal Reserve.; Given these findings, Duca argues that M 2 B and M 2 + show promise as information variables that the Federal Reserve may use along with other economic indicators in setting monetary policy. Recent forecast results and anecdotal information suggest that if equity funds continue to become more substitutable for nontransactions deposits, M 2 + may prove to be increasingly helpful in this capacity.

In this work we introduce the first open source structure generator, Open Molecule Generator (OMG), which for a given elemental composition produces all non-isomorphic chemical structures that match that elemental composition. Furthermore, this structure generator can accept as additional input one or multiple nonoverlapping prescribed substructures to drastically reduce the number of possible chemical structures. Being open source allows for customization and future extension of its functionality. OMG relies on {{a modified version of the}} Canonical Augmentation Path, which grows intermediate chemical structures by <b>adding</b> <b>bonds</b> and checks that at each step only unique molecules are produced. In order to benchmark the tool, we generated chemical structures for the elemental formulas and substructures of different metabolites and compared the results with a commercially available structure generator.

For elemental compositions containing C, O, H, N, P and S, OMG produces all the chemically valid molecules while the other generator produces more, yet chemically impossible, molecules. The chemical completeness of the OMG results comes at the expense of being slower than the commercial generator. In addition to being open source, OMG clearly showed the added value of constraining the solution space by using multiple prescribed substructures as input. We expect this structure generator to be useful in many fields, but to be especially of great importance for metabolomics, where identifying unknown metabolites is still a major bottleneck...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{grounding}} {{is probably}} the most over-looke~ ignored, and misunderstood part of electrical energy source circuits. A faulty ground circuit am have lethal potential to the worker, can damage electrical equipment" or components, and can lead to higher consequences. For example, if the green-wire ground return circuit (in a three-wire power circuit) is fhulty or is open (someone cut the prong, etc.) a person can receive an electrical shock by touching the conductive enclosure, and the result can be lethal. If high explosives are involved m the process, sneak electrical energy paths may cause electrical threats that lead to ignition, which results to higher damage consequences. Proper electrical grounding is essential to mitigate the electrical hazard and improve work place safety. A designer must ask the question, "What grounding is proper?" continuously through a process design and in its application. This question must be readdressed with any process change, including tiom layout, equipment, or procedure changes. Electrical grounding varies ilom local work area grounding to the multi-point grounding found in large industrial areas.
