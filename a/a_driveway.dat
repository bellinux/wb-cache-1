5|$|Chris Brandkamp {{produced}} most of {{the ambient}} and incidental sounds in the game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp {{had to wait until}} the game's visuals were placed in context. Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in <b>a</b> <b>driveway,</b> because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then transposed to a lower pitch.|$|E
5|$|Beckford's Tower in Lansdown {{overlooking}} {{the city of}} Bath, was completed in 1827 for wealthy local resident William Beckford, to a design by Bath architect Henry Goodridge. Beckford was an English novelist, an art collector and patron of works of decorative art, a critic, travel writer and sometime politician, reputed at one stage in his life to be the richest commoner in England. In 1822 he sold Fonthill Abbey, and {{a large part of}} his art collection, to John Farquhar for £330,000, and moved to Bath, where he bought No. 20 Lansdown Crescent and No. 1 Lansdown Place West, joining them with a one-storey arch thrown across <b>a</b> <b>driveway.</b> In 1836 he also bought Nos. 18 and 19 Lansdown Crescent.|$|E
5|$|The {{entirety}} of SR357 exists {{within the confines}} of South Bass Island in Lake Erie. It is located within Put-in-Bay Township in Ottawa County. In 2012, between 490 and 590 vehicles travel on the road on average each day. SR 357 begins at West Shore Boulevard, and travels southwestward. The route passes by Oak Point State Park, and becomes part of Bayview Avenue. SR 357 then intersects County Route 163, which leads to the Put-in-Bay Airport, and the Put-in-Bay–Catawba Island ferry. The route later leaves Put-in-Bay, near Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial. SR 357 turns northeast to Columbus Avenue, and later ends at a dead end near the lake, next to <b>a</b> <b>driveway.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1654, when Michael Roberts was principal, {{the college}} {{accounts}} record payment {{for construction of}} a ball court. This was {{to the west of}} the principal's garden (which is to the north of the lodgings, alongside Ship Street), between a privy, stables, and the wall of the garden. Ball courts, bowling greens and groves were often added within the precincts of colleges during the 17th century so that undergraduates could amuse themselves under the watchful eyes of their tutors, rather than indulge in forbidden pursuits such as drinking in alehouses. In 1757, principal Thomas Pardo added the area of the ball court to the garden of the lodgings and had a coach-house built there, which was reached from an entrance on the corner of Turl Street and Ship Street along <b>a</b> <b>driveway</b> across the north of the garden.|$|E

25|$|In farming communities, each {{town had}} one or more small grain {{elevators}} that would serve the local growers.

Wooden cribbed elevators usually had <b>a</b> <b>driveway</b> with truck scale and office on one side, a rail line {{on the other side}} and additional grain storage annex bins on either side.|$|E

The entrance is on the north face, but the main façade is on the east side, fronting <b>a</b> <b>driveway</b> leading to the Brighton Road. The 1860s single-storey extension is on the west side, and has three bays with round-arched windows. The north side also has three bays.

25|$|From 1940–65, the University of Miami {{baseball}} team played their games at {{a field in}} {{the southwest corner of}} the block where the stadium sat.

There was also a softball field to the east across the driveway—during football season, the baseball and softball fields were both used for parking. The Hurricanes opened a new ballpark in 1973, and Miami Field's small seating area was demolished, with the land occupied by the two fields reconfigured into full-time parking areas.|$|E

When Lucinda Schaefer passed the van, Norris exchanged a few words with her before dragging her into the van and closing the door. Using a ruse they would repeat in most of their subsequent murders, Bittaker turned the radio to full volume as Norris bound the victim's {{arms and legs and}} gagged her with duct tape as Bittaker drove Schaefer to the fire road in the San Gabriel Mountains where, in April, the pair had previously switched the locks.|$|E
25|$|Ottawa {{has several}} older neighbourhoods {{clustered}} around the downtown core, including the Glebe, Sandy Hill, New Edinburgh, Centretown, Lower Town and Old Ottawa South. These areas were mainly built up {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries. The houses in these areas tend to be in Victorian or Queen Anne style, but rarely have any conspicuous ornamentation. These are usually two or three storey single homes. Recent infills in these neighbourhoods have often taken the form of townhouses. Red brick, sometimes painted other colours, is the dominant surface material. Most houses have sizable lots, with <b>a</b> <b>driveway</b> running to a shed, or a small lane way running behind the buildings. In the 1920s and 1930s new styles were imported, and many houses from this era take inspiration from the Arts and crafts and Prairie styles.|$|E
25|$|Kew, {{the area}} in which Kew Gardens are situated, {{consists}} mainly of the gardens themselves and a small surrounding community. Royal residences in the area which would later influence the layout and construction of the gardens began in 1299 when Edward I moved his court to a manor house in neighbouring Richmond (then called Sheen). That manor house was later abandoned; however, Henry VII built Sheen Palace in 1501, which, under the name Richmond Palace, became a permanent royal residence for Henry VII. Around the start of the 16th century courtiers attending Richmond Palace settled in Kew and built large houses. Early royal residences at Kew included Mary Tudor's house, which was in existence by 1522 when <b>a</b> <b>driveway</b> was built to connect it to the palace at Richmond. Around 1600, the land that would become the gardens was known as Kew Field, a large field strip farmed by one of the new private estates.|$|E

25|$|In 1828, {{construction}} on the C Canal commenced and was completed in 1850. Laborers were. primarily Irish immigrants Throughout the 19th century, agriculture dominated the economy in Montgomery County, with slaves playing a significant role, though {{the vast majority of}} farmers owned 10 slaves or less rather than large plantations. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, low tobacco prices and worn-out soil caused many tobacco farms to be abandoned. Crop production gradually shifted away from tobacco and toward wheat and corn. Prior to the Civil War, Montgomery County allied itself with other slaveholding counties in southern Maryland and the Eastern Shore. Montgomery County was important in the abolitionist movement, especially among the Quakers in the northern part of the county near Sandy Spring. Josiah Henson grew up as a slave on the Riley farm south of Rockville. He wrote about his experiences in a memoir which became the basis for Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852). A slave cabin where he is believed to have spent time still stands at the end of <b>a</b> <b>driveway</b> off Old Georgetown Road.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{expansion}} of the campus Swedish American Hospital now includes several separate and interconnecting structures. The main campus is bounded by East State Street (US 20) on its north and by East Charles Street on its south-southwest side. Intersecting Charles and State Streets at the hospital's west boundary is Ninth Street, to the east is Williams Park. The buildings within the main Swedish American complex include the 94 bed heart hospital, SwedishAmerican Regional Cancer Center, a state of the art radiology and oncology center, opened in July 2013, Camelot Tower, the Renaissance Pavilion, the two main wings, and two other buildings which are located {{on the periphery of the}} main campus. The Ninth Street Center is located across Ninth Street from Swedish American Hospital and the L.P Johnson Building is located in the complex's far northwest corner. The hospital also owns an 1873 Gothic Revival house, known as the Lake-Peterson House which was donated by the estate of Pehr August Peterson. The house stands on the main Swedish American campus and is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The emergency room entrance at Swedish American is located on the buildings west facade and is entered via <b>a</b> <b>driveway</b> that stretches from Charles Street, across the complex, to State Street.|$|E
