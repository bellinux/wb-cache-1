5|$|Spotted hyenas {{will follow}} packs of African wild dogs {{in order to}} {{appropriate}} their kills. They will typically inspect areas where wild dogs have rested and eat any food remains they find. When approaching wild dogs at a kill, solitary hyenas will approach cautiously and attempt to take off with <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> unnoticed, {{though they may be}} mobbed by the dogs in the attempt. When operating in groups, spotted hyenas are more successful in pirating dog kills, though the dog's greater tendency to assist each other puts them at an advantage against spotted hyenas, who rarely work in unison. Cases of dogs scavenging from spotted hyenas are rare. Although wild dog packs can easily repel solitary hyenas, on the whole, {{the relationship between the two}} species is a one sided benefit for the hyenas, with wild dog densities being negatively correlated with high hyena populations.|$|E
500|$|This {{title of}} [...] "Spokesman of a Generation" [...] was viewed by Dylan with disgust in later years. He came {{to feel it}} was a label that the media had pinned on him, and in his autobiography, Chronicles, Dylan wrote: [...] "The press never let up. Once in a while I would have to rise up and offer myself for an {{interview}} so they wouldn't beat the door down. Later an article would hit the streets with the headline [...] "Spokesman Denies That He's A Spokesman".

500|$|One {{experiment}} {{designed to}} evaluate insight and problem-solving ability involved <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> {{attached to a}} string hanging from a perch. To reach the food, the bird needed {{to stand on the}} perch, pull the string up a little at a time, and step on the loops to gradually shorten the string. Four of five common ravens eventually succeeded, and [...] "the transition from no success (ignoring the food or merely yanking at the string) to constant reliable access (pulling up the meat) occurred with no demonstrable trial-and-error learning." [...] This supports the hypothesis that common ravens are 'inventors', implying that they can solve problems. Many of the feats of common ravens were formerly argued to be stereotyped innate behaviour, but it now has been established that their aptitudes for solving problems individually and learning from each other reflect a flexible capacity for intelligent insight unusual among non-human animals.|$|E

500|$|William Abler {{observed}} in 2001 that Albertosaurus tooth serrations resemble {{a crack in}} the tooth ending in a round void called an ampulla. Tyrannosaurid teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling flesh off a body, so when a tyrannosaur pulled back on <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat,</b> the tension could cause a purely crack-like serration to spread through the tooth. However, the presence of the ampulla distributed these forces over a larger surface area, and lessened the risk of damage to the tooth under strain. The presence of incisions ending in voids has parallels in human engineering. Guitar makers use incisions ending in voids to, as Abler describes, [...] "impart alternating regions of flexibility and rigidity" [...] to wood they work. The use of a drill to create an [...] "ampulla" [...] of sorts and prevent the propagation of cracks through material is also used to protect aircraft surfaces. Abler demonstrated that a plexiglass bar with incisions called [...] "kerfs" [...] and drilled holes was more than 25% stronger than one with only regularly placed incisions. Unlike tyrannosaurs, ancient predators like phytosaurs and Dimetrodon had no adaptations to prevent the crack-like serrations of their teeth from spreading when subjected to the forces of feeding.|$|E

500|$|Jezebel {{determined}} that Belle [...] "is often {{held up as}} the standard of the 'feminist' Disney princess." [...] According to Tales, Then and Now: More Folktales as Literary Fictions for Young Adults author Anna E. Altmann, Disney heavily promoted Beauty and the Beast as [...] "a feminist fairy tale" [...] due to Belle's characterization and role in the film. In his book Hearing a Film, Seeing a Sermon: Preaching and Popular Movies, author Timothy B. Cargal agreed that the character indicated [...] "Disney's ... continued efforts to reshape their heroines for a more feminist age." [...] According to Girl Culture: An Encyclopedia author Claudia Mitchell, Belle's feminism was influenced by third-wave feminism and the relatively new concept of girl power during the 1990s. Feminist critics have been generally mixed in their analyses of Belle, arguing {{over whether or not}} the character is in fact [...] "feminist enough." [...] Although Beauty and the Beast was initially lauded upon release for starring a [...] "forward thinking and feminist" [...] heroine, critics tend to agree that, in spite of Belle's independence and resentment towards Gaston, Beauty and the Beast essentially remains a romance about a girl who finally [...] "meets her ideal man." [...] Acknowledging that Belle [...] "represented significant change from [...] sweet, mop-wielding predecessors," [...] Twilight and History author Nancy Reagin observed that [...] "the end result of fulfillment through marriage has been maintained." [...] Kathleen Maher of The Austin Chronicle cited Belle as an example of [...] "pseudo-feminism" [...] because she rejects one man, Gaston, in favor of another, a prince. While commending Belle for [...] "seeing past the beast's appearance," [...] Judith Welikala of The Independent in the end accused the character of [...] "melting back into the role of wife when he turns back into a handsome prince." [...] Fairy Tale author Andrew Teverson referred to Belle as Disney's attempt to address [...] "feminist criticism of its representation of women in earlier films," [...] but ultimately criticized the character's curiosity for [...] "extend only to romance," [...] additionally accusing her of being [...] "a zealous individualist with a pathological hostility to common men and women." [...] Meanwhile, Stylist ranked Belle among the most feminist Disney characters, describing her as an [...] "incredibly intelligent" [...] woman who [...] "doesn't stand for a man who considers her as just <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> ... she wants someone who loves her for her mind too." [...] Acknowledging the character's [...] "feminist longings," [...] Daniel Eagen, author of America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry, cited Belle as Disney's [...] "modern-day corrective to Snow White." [...] Beyond Adaptation: Essays on Radical Transformations of Original Works author Phyllis Frus wrote that, initially, Beauty and the Beast does not seem [...] "remotely feminist." [...] However, the author did acknowledge Belle as [...] "an appealing character with a noticeable feminist streak," [...] but in the end criticized Disney's Consumer Products of reversing what the film had nearly accomplished by inducting the character into the Disney Princess franchise. In Refinery29's [...] "Definitive Ranking Of Disney Princesses As Feminist Role Models," [...] author Vanessa Golembewski ranked the character eighth but described her personality and ambitions as [...] "confusing." [...] Complex's Tara Aquino described Belle as [...] "a kinda feminist ... who's well-read, self-sufficient, and with standards high enough that she doesn't fall for the town's brain-dead pretty boy." ...|$|E
