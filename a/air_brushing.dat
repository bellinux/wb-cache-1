While tubes of this material have been prepared by extrusion, further improvements in oxygen transport performance may be gained by preparing thinner membranes on porous supports. In this paper, we will discuss the deposition of thick films by spray deposition and centrifugal casting, and thin films by pyrolysis of chemical precursors. For the chemically derived thin films, porous MgO supports were used as membrane supports. Three types of precursor solutions were employed for dipcoating: a Pechini type solution, a nitrate-based solution, and a citrate-based solution. To prevent the infiltration of the precursor into the support, the support was backfilled with a material that decomposed at higher temperatures than the precursors. Cracking due to the volume changes during drying and pyrolysis of the precursors is discussed. Thick films were prepared by spray coating and centrifugal casting. Spray deposition of thick film membranes was accomplished by <b>air</b> <b>brushing</b> SCF from a water-based suspension {{onto the surface of}} a porous MgO support. Films on the interior surface of the supports were prepared by centrifugal casting using a xylene/butanol-based SCF suspension. Unlike extruded tubes, thick films undergo constrained sintering due to the presence of the support, which greatly reduces the densification rate.

40|$|Chemical sensors {{based on}} arrays of polymer-coated surface {{acoustic}} wave (SAW) devices are required for defense applications that provide a combination of sensitivity, selectivity, portability and response time. The primary challenge {{in the development of}} these polymer-based microsensors is the need to reproducibly deposit high quality, defect-free polymer coatings onto microelectrodes. Coating methods such as <b>air</b> <b>brushing</b> and solvent casting have proven unreliable and I have investigated the possibility of depositing polymer films on microelectrodes using electrostatic processing methods. In this work AC electrospraying was used to deposit nanoscale polymer films onto the surface of microelectrodes. The alternating polarity of the electric field eliminates surface charge accumulation and the polymers were deposited uniformly across both electrically insulating and conducting surface regions. In a different work, DC electrospraying was used to deposit patterned organic coatings onto the surface of microelectrodes. The surface of the microelectrode array consisted of an alternating pattern of insulating, grounded-metallic and ungrounded metallic regions, each with a width of 15 µm. The charged particles were deposited only onto the grounded-metallic surface regions where there is an electrical path for charge dissipation. No polymer deposition was observed on the insulating or ungrounded-metallic regions due to the effects of surface charge accumulation. Also, I, DC electrodeposited organic molecules within the pores of ceramic film. Due to electrospraying, this film has a strong built-in electric field that induces Stark effect in the organic molecules, providing a unique new technology for bio and chemical sensing. Electrospinning has been used to produce polymer nanofibers with diameters ranging from a few microns to less than 100 nanometers. Due to mechanical oscillations of the electrically charged fibers during electrospinning, they are usually collected {{in the form of a}} non-woven mat without any significant fiber orientation. I have developed a new method for making highly aligned arrays of polymer nanofibers by using an AC coupled DC field to drive the electrospinning process. This new 2 ̆ 2 biased AC electrospinning 2 ̆ 2 method can be used to deposit aligned arrays of polymer nanofibers onto virtually any substrate. Potential applications of well-ordered nanofiber materials include tissue engineering, filtration, drug delivery and microelectronics...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is part of}} the Gender and Sport track. From a North American liberal feminist philosophical perspective based on a combination of Martha Nussbaum (1999) and Joy Desensi’s (1992) interpretations of liberal feminism, I will argue that science and technology in their general conception have negatively impacted women athletes and women’s sport. According to DeSensi, a general claim of liberal feminism is that the oppression of women is caused by unequal civil rights and educational opportunities due to prejudices related to sex, race and age. Liberal feminism demands reforms in both cultural and social life to take place. The goal of liberalism, according to Nussbaum, is to take a stand for what is good for people and to place individuals into a position of agency and choice. I will argue that because of various scientific technological advancements, we view women athletes and women’s sport to be a weaker product than its male counterpart. The sporting culture is not far removed from conceptual societal expectations and norms and often reinforces negative attitudes toward women athletes and their achievements. Consequently, gender norms that exist in society are usually reproduced and further perpetuated in sporting culture and vice versa. The paper will focus specifically on the concepts of sexualization and objectification. In order to ensure the narrow scope of this analysis, the underpinning and interconnecting argument of the problematic understanding of sexualization in connection with science and technology will be continually stressed and highlighted. Given the close relationship between sport and society, I will begin the argument with a brief glimpse into the past to demonstrate that women’s sexuality continues to be contested and perceived to be negative and troubling. A brief historical analysis detailing the origin of the vibrator and the treatment of women’s orgasms will help to support such a claim. The case of the vibrator will be connected to the criticisms women experienced when they first began to bicycle in the Victorian age. For instance, many believed that women should not bicycle because they might masturbate with the seat. This case helps to demonstrate the tension surrounding women’s sexuality and participation in athletics. Arguments will draw on Paul Davis (2001) and Martha Nussbaum’s (1999) theories surrounding the problematic understanding of sexualization and objectification in order to reinforce some of the impacts science and technology have had on women athletes and women’s sports at both the elite and recreational levels. Overall, there are two main components to this analysis. Firstly, I will argue that technologically advanced media coverage has resulted in an increase in the hypersexualization of women’s sport. I believe that the sexist images of women athletes commonly found in the media are an extension of the technological age of pornography culture. It should be emphasized that science and technology have enabled the photography industry to alter every tiny aspect of a person’s body to create a perfect, yet unattainable or unimaginable, reflection. Contemporary photographs of women contain no flaws, no blemishes, no pimples, no unwanted hair, or unsightly fat. New technologies in <b>air</b> <b>brushing</b> and photodoctoring give women the sense that scrutiny itself has become superhuman. No doubt, technology will continue to radically destabilize the social value of the female body and furthermore, I consider the destabilizing to be rooted in sexualization. Women athletes experience tension because of their struggle to uphold a desired heterosexual supermodel-like being. This has ultimately skewed our view of how we consume women’s athletics. For example, the popularity and relevancy of the “crotch cam” in women’s sport will be addressed to demonstrate the predominance of sexualization in sport. Secondly, because of the technological advancements in women’s sporting fashion and uniforms, I will argue that women are too often positioned as weak and fragile. More specifically, progress in clothing designs does not seem to promote the sentiment of moving freely; some garments, I will claim, actually hinder participation in physical activity and help to perpetuate the frailty myth in women’s athletics and greater society. I will refer to the case of Nike and its incredible investment in science and technology to develop the ultimate high heel shoe for women. I will argue that when a sporting company spends nearly fifteen years of technology and research effort in designing the most comfortable high heel, that this further perpetuates the sexualization of women. High heels share several similarities with other fashion-constricting items, such as corsets, which restrict and impede women’s ability to move. Granted, the shoe may be the most comfortable high heel on the market; however, it is fair to suggest that {{it would be difficult to}} run or even move quickly down the street or a flight of steep stairs in a four-inch heel. It seems that women’s victory within the sporting fashion market is celebrated in having a pair of comfortable high heels, for even Nike’s current advertising campaign proclaims, “everything you need is already inside of you. ” Overall, I will argue that for women athletes, more than just inner motivation and courage is needed; they are required to project a heterosexual, “sexy” image, which, I will argue throughout the paper, has ultimately been perpetuated and encouraged by scientific technological advancements...|$|E

Optical and rheological evaluations were performed and showed that parameters such as the amount of incorporated nanofibers, gellan gum concentration and calcium chloride (crosslinker) concentrations could be used to modulate material properties. Incorpo-ration of a small amount of nanofibers had a reinforcing effect and resulted in a hydrogel with rheological properties similar to the human nucleus pulposus (NP).

40|$|The {{research}} considers whether traditional {{approaches to}} easel paintings conservation {{are appropriate for}} the treatment of <b>air</b> <b>brush</b> paintings. The objectives were: -To investigate the aesthetic and technical history of the airbrush -To investigate surface changes in paint layers -To investigate the appropriateness of traditional conservation treatments for airbrush paintings and evaluate alternative approaches Although the first airbrush was introduced in 1883 it was initially rejected by many fine art circles as being too ‘mechanical’. Airbrush techniques have been little discussed in the field of fine art and the field of the conservation of fine art. A mixed methodology was followed for this research, qualitative through literature review carried out in line with the interdisciplinary nature of the research, and quantitative through various approaches including surveys. One survey was carried out in order to establish the use of <b>air</b> <b>brush</b> techniques by artists and its eventual acceptance as a fine art technique. A second survey was conducted to discover how well conservators understood the degradation characteristics of <b>air</b> <b>brush</b> paintings and their appropriate treatment. The research revealed that much of the eventual success of <b>air</b> <b>brush</b> painting resulted from the introduction of new types of paint in order to better manage the technique. It also revealed that there was a high level of uncertainty amongst practitioners in the field of paintings conservation with regard to the deterioration characteristics of <b>air</b> <b>brush</b> painting or their appropriate resolution. However the major concern with regard to conservation lay clearly within the field of image re-integration {{as a result of its}} characteristically smooth surface finish. Artificial light ageing was carried out on simulated mock ups in order to develop a clearer understanding of the type of surface changes that might be expected over time from a limited palette of colours. This was followed by technical visual examination and media analysis via FTIR and Py- GC-MS methods. It was found that there were changes in surface morphology in some colours, which appeared to further enhance the smooth surface finish of the paint layer. A range of approaches to image re-integration were trialled ranging from the traditional paint based approaches to the use of digital coloured light. The latter was of particular interest in offering a truly reversible none interventive approach to re-integration. The focus of the digital re-integration techniques was to evaluate the viability of its use in general practice. Due to the smooth surface as well as the build-up of multiple layers of colour the traditional approaches proved difficult to harmonise within the picture plain. The use of digital approaches using coloured light was more successful although further research is required in order to develop this approach for wide spread professional practice. The physical and chemical characteristics of the airbrushed paint layer present issues that are fundamentally different to those found in oil paintings. As yet these are not all fully understood and require further research. Until such time the use of none interventive, reversible image re-integration techniques such as coloured light would be recommended...|$|R

Problems of preferred orientation are effectively eliminated and the resulting X-ray powder patterns are completely reproducible by different operators. The importance of sample preparation for X-ray powder diffraction cannot be overemphasized (Brindley, 1984; Bish & Reynolds, 1989).
