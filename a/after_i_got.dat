500|$|Romney {{supported}} the American Civil Rights Movement while governor. [...] Although {{he belonged to}} a church that did not allow black people in its lay clergy, Romney's hardscrabble background and subsequent life experiences led him to support the movement. He reflected, [...] "It was only <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to Detroit that I got to know Negroes and began {{to be able to}} evaluate them and I began to recognize that some Negroes are better and more capable than lots of whites." [...] During his first State of the State address in January 1963, Romney declared that [...] "Michigan's most urgent human rights problem is racial discrimination—in housing, public accommodations, education, administration of justice, and employment." [...] Romney helped create the state's first civil rights commission.|$|E
500|$|Many rappers {{have taken}} note of Illmatics {{influence}} on their lyricism. Ghostface Killah recounted, “When I used to listen to Nas back in the days, it was like, ‘Oh shit! He murdered that.’ That forced me to get my pen game up... The whole Illmatic album forced you {{to go ahead and}} do shit... It was inspiration." [...] Detroit rapper Elzhi states, [...] "round the time Nas did Illmatic, it made me wanna step my game up... He's one of the reasons I did go off into storytelling because his pictures were so vivid. When he displayed his rhyme schemes and his word play and his songs, it made me wanna create visual pictures as well." [...] Casey Veggies also recounts the impact Nas' lyricism had on his own work as an underground rapper in the 2000s: “I [...] Illmatic when I was 14, 15. I didn’t get onto to it till late, but when I did, that's probably the only thing I listened to for six months to a year... <b>After</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> heavy on Illmatic, I put out Sleeping In Class (2010). That's when I really tried to sharpen my skills and get better.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In September 1948, as a captain, Griffin {{received}} sudden {{orders to}} report to the Strategic Plans Division (OP-30) in the Department of the Navy as officer in charge of special projects. [...] "That meant practically nothing to me when I heard this. It wasn't too long <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back there that I got head over heels into the business of the so-called revolt of the admirals -- the B-36 affair. I found that the special projects {{had to do with the}} preparation of statements for the chief of naval operations on very critical points." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 3 October 1870: [...] "Louise {{had gone}} with Janie, E., the Lord Chancellor, & Lord Lorne to Loch Muich & the Glassalt. They {{returned}} some time <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> home, & Louise came {{to speak to me}} & tell me, that while walking up to the Dhu Loch, Lord Lorne had told her of his feelings for her & had in fact proposed to her, & Knowing that I would approve & liked him, she had accepted him. I embraced her & gave her my blessing, but felt greatly agitated. I was not unprepared but did not expect it would come so quick. Of course nothing can be said till Lorne has heard from his Parents." ...|$|E
2500|$|Patton married Cristina Zuccatosta, an Italian artist, in 1994. The couple divided {{their time}} between San Francisco and Bologna, Italy, until their {{separation}} in 2001. Patton used {{to own a}} home in Bologna and speaks Italian. Regarding his close association with Italy, Patton stated, [...] "It happened <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> married. I married an Italian lady, and I had to get acquainted. Basically, it started with the language because her family and her parents didn't really speak English. I had to learn the language, so I did that. The longer you spend {{in a place like}} that, it really sucks you in. It really envelopes you and makes you feel like one of them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several {{members of}} the cast {{described}} Hustle's filming schedule as incredibly hectic. Vaughn said that [...] " [...] was offered to me, and I was told {{to get on a}} plane an hour <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the phone call and start shooting the following day." [...] Speaking in 2009 after filming four series of the show, Lester explained that [...] "when we start shooting Hustle we film two episodes concurrently, with the scenes out of sequence. Knowing where you are in the intricate plots at any one moment is... challenging". Murray, by contrast, claimed that the hardest scene to film was from the fourth episode, when Danny loses spectacularly to Stacie in strip poker and ends up entirely naked. [...] "It was the toughest scene for me of the entire six months we spent filming the series... Stacie is supposed to be calm, cool and collected... she looks down, checks him out and casually and suavely makes a comment. I kept looking down, dissolving into fits of laughter and was almost unable to deliver my line. So all you'll see is me laughing".|$|E
2500|$|Powers first appears {{publicly}} {{presenting the}} religion in February 1948 giving a talk in Los Angeles Bahá'í Center. That year he also publicly reflected on {{his career in}} law enforcement writing two articles for the Saturday Evening Post - a two part series Crime was my business. In it of his twenty five years in police work he said [...] "It's {{a long time to}} last without becoming a cynic" [...] and:During some of those years I was ridden by fear of being double-crossed out of my job by politicians. Often I dreaded that some situation would catch me unaware and daub me with the yellow mud of a coward's reputation. I worried that I'd lose my temper, go haywire and end up before the grand jury twisting my uniform buttons nervously and begging for mercy. There was the wear and tear of wondering if the chiefs I served under would let me down when I needed to be backed up. And <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to be chief, there was never a time when someone didn't hate my guts, and I had to be up on my toes to keep my enemies from feathering my back with knives.|$|E
2500|$|Tommy Lee of Mötley Crüe fame played drums on [...] "Meet the Creeper" [...] and [...] "The Ballad of Resurrection Joe and Rosa Whore".

And they asked me to play and I was like, 'I would love to play right now. I could really use ... you know, just kind of check out, really do some music' and I ended up playing like four tracks or so on the record."
