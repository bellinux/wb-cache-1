25|$|Usual {{practice}} {{was to have}} a drawhook fitted to only one of the mating couplers and train crews therefore carried spare drawhooks and drawhook pins on the locomotive. While <b>automatic</b> <b>coupling</b> is possible, this rarely happens and manual assistance is required during coupling. Uncoupling is done manually by lifting the drawhook by hand to release it. The coupler could be adapted to be compatible with the Johnston coupler by replacing the drawhook with a U-shaped adapter link, which was attached using the same drawhook pin.|$|E
2500|$|The Scharfenberg coupler (...) is {{probably}} the most commonly used type of fully <b>automatic</b> <b>coupling.</b> Designed in 1903 by Karl Scharfenberg in Königsberg, Germany (today Kaliningrad, Russia), it has gradually spread from transit trains to regular passenger service trains, although outside Europe its use is generally restricted to mass transit systems. The Schaku coupler is superior in many ways to the AAR (Janney/Knuckle) coupler because it makes the electrical and also the pneumatic connections and disconnections automatic. However, there is no standard for the placement of these electro-pneumatic connections. Some rail companies have them placed on the sides while others have them placed above the mechanical portion of the Schaku coupler. The main disadvantage to the Scharfenberg coupler is its low maximum tonnage, which makes it unsuitable for freight operations.|$|E

5000|$|Dodge is {{reported}} to have used the 1969 Charger as its inspiration for the remodeling. The engines include the [...] Chrysler 5.7 liter Hemi V8 and the [...] 3.6 liter V6. The V6 model is EPA-rated at 31MPG or 7.6L/100km which is claimed by the manufacturer to be the best in its class. The only transmission is the Chrysler eight-speed <b>automatic,</b> <b>coupled</b> with optional all-wheel drive. The all-wheel drive system will automatically remove drive to the front axle when not required, giving an improvement in fuel economy. The new electronic gearshift with optional paddle shift gives shift times of as little as 0.25 seconds in sport mode.|$|R
30|$|Concerning wagons, the {{question}} is whether development will be incremental or if it is possible to make a system change (see Table 1). An incremental change means successively higher axle loads, wider gauge, higher payload, better and more silent brakes and some electronic equipment. A system change will include electro-pneumatic brakes, disc brakes (from cast brakes) and full electronic control (from pneumatic) of wagons and load, and automatic central couplers (from screw couplers). Automatic couplers are the most critical component, not only to make shunting and marshalling safer and cheaper, but also because this will make it easier to operate longer trains. However, to introduce <b>automatic</b> <b>couples</b> it must be supported by a thorough cost-benefit analysis.|$|R

50|$|For {{the express}} {{passenger}} service between Johannesburg and Pretoria and long-distance passenger services to Cape Town, the CSAR also introduced passenger coaches with closed vestibules, concertina connections and Gould knuckle couplers. This <b>automatic</b> <b>coupling</b> system would only {{begin to be}} implemented on the South African Railways (SAR) in 1927. At the time, all this modern equipment placed the CSAR ahead of both the CGR and Natal Government Railways (NGR) in terms of technical advancement.|$|E

50|$|Production of the Scarab ceased in 1967 {{and it was}} {{replaced}} with the Scammell Townsman that now featured a fibreglass cab. Like that fitted to the Trunker, Handyman and Routeman, it was designed by Giovanni Michelotti. The Townsman utilised many developments in large vehicles including vacuum-assisted hydraulic brakes and although the same <b>automatic</b> <b>coupling</b> feature was used, this now used a vacuum-operated release mechanism rather than the hand lever found in earlier models. Despite numerous improvements, the Townsman was mainly sold to British Rail and the Royal Mail and production ended in 1968 as forthcoming construction and use regulations mandating dual-line brakes on articulated combinations could not be met.|$|E
