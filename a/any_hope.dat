5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the third}} quarter, <b>any</b> <b>hope</b> of victory was {{seemingly}} out of reach for Virginia Tech. Three quick plays after the kickoff resulted in a first down before time ran out, but at {{the end of the}} third quarter, Florida State still had a 273 lead.|$|E
5|$|Spindler {{was ordered}} to switch his attacks further south to try to force the British away from the river, {{isolating}} the British from <b>any</b> <b>hope</b> of reinforcement and allowing them to be destroyed. Despite their best efforts, however, they were unsuccessful, although the constant artillery and assaults continued to wear the British defences down further.|$|E
5|$|During their {{retreat from}} Quebec, the Americans {{carefully}} took or destroyed all ships on Lake Champlain that might prove {{useful to the}} British. When Arnold and his troops, making up the rear guard of the army, abandoned Fort Saint-Jean, they burned or sank all the boats they could not use, and {{set fire to the}} sawmill and the fort. These actions effectively denied the British <b>any</b> <b>hope</b> of immediately moving onto the lake.|$|E

Meanwhile, the Royal Navy captured Monmouth's ships, cutting off <b>any</b> <b>hope</b> of an escape back to the continent. The Royalist forces of Churchill, who was now in Chard, and of Feversham, in Bristol, also received reinforcements who had marched from London.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} at Alexandria, Cleomenes {{was greeted by}} Ptolemy, who welcomed him with smiles and promises. At first Ptolemy was guarded towards Cleomenes, but soon came to respect him and promised to send him back to Greece with an army and a fleet. He also promised to provide Cleomenes with an annual income of twenty-four talents. However, before he could fulfill his promise, Ptolemy died—and with him <b>any</b> <b>hope</b> for Cleomenes to return to Greece, as the weak Ptolemy IV ascended the throne.|$|E
5|$|At the Lannister army camp, Lord Tywin Lannister and his {{followers}} discuss their recent setbacks: not only have they lost an important battle, and Jaime, to the Starks, along with his entire army, but both Baratheon brothers now also threaten them. Because his grandson's execution of Ned Stark destroyed <b>any</b> <b>hope</b> to sue for peace between the Starks and the Lannisters, Tywin orders his son Tyrion to go to King's Landing in his stead as Hand of the King {{in order to keep}} Joffrey under control. Against his father's orders, Tyrion brings the prostitute Shae with him to the capital.|$|E

5|$|Gian Gastone {{arrived in}} Tuscany, without his wife, in 1708. The Emperor, {{thinking}} {{it unlikely that}} any male heirs were to be born to the Medici, prepared to occupy Tuscany, under the pretext of Medici descent. He intimated that upon the Grand Prince's death the Tuscans would rebel against Cosimo's autocratic government. Cosimo, {{in an act of}} desperation, had Francesco Maria, the Medici family cardinal, renounce his religious vows and marry Eleanor of Gonzaga, the youngest child of the incumbent Duke of Guastalla. Two years later, Francesco Maria died, taking with him <b>any</b> <b>hope</b> of an heir.|$|E
5|$|On 18 March the PAVN {{had taken}} Phuoc An, {{eliminating}} <b>any</b> <b>hope</b> of reaching Buôn Ma Thuột. Darlac Province {{in its entirety}} then fell under North Vietnamese control. ARVN forces began to rapidly shift positions {{in an attempt to}} keep the North Vietnamese from quickly pushing eastward to the coastal lowlands. In the final analysis, the blame for the fall of the highlands lies with General Phú, who refused to act on sound intelligence and when he realized his error, {{it was too late to}} get reinforcements to the scene.|$|E
5|$|On 22 May, Churchill {{ordered the}} BEF to attack southward in {{co-ordination}} with the French First Army under General Georges Blanchard {{to reconnect with}} {{the remainder of the}} French forces. This proposed action was dubbed the Weygand Plan after General Maxime Weygand, appointed Supreme Commander after Gamelin's dismissal on 18 May. On 25 May, Gort had to abandon <b>any</b> <b>hope</b> of achieving this objective and withdrew on his own initiative, along with Blanchard's forces behind the Lys Canal, part of a canal system that reached the sea at Gravelines. Sluice gates had already been opened all along the canal to flood the system and create a barrier (the Canal Line) against the German advance.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the fall}} of the Republic, the {{authority}} of the Roman Senate had largely eroded under the quasi-monarchical system of government established by Augustus, known as the Principate. The Principate allowed the existence of a de facto dictatorial regime, while maintaining the formal framework of the Roman Republic. Most Emperors upheld the public facade of democracy, and in return the Senate implicitly acknowledged the Emperor's status as a de facto monarch. The civil war of 69 had made it abundantly clear that real power in the Empire lay with control over the army. By the time Vespasian was proclaimed emperor in Rome, <b>any</b> <b>hope</b> of restoring the Republic had long dissipated.|$|E
5|$|The club {{continued}} to challenge for honours throughout the 1970s, finishing one point behind the league champions {{on two occasions}} and reaching {{the final of the}} 1974 League Cup. One of the matches from this period that is most fondly remembered by supporters of Manchester City is the final match of the 1973–74 season against arch-rivals Manchester United, who needed to win to have <b>any</b> <b>hope</b> of avoiding relegation. Former United player Denis Law scored with a backheel to give City a 1–0 win at Old Trafford and confirm the relegation of their rivals. The final trophy of the club's most successful period was won in 1976, when Newcastle United were beaten 2–1 in the League Cup final.|$|E
5|$|A {{friend of}} Eberhardt's {{gave her a}} letter of {{introduction}} to playwright Eugène Brieux, who opposed French rule in North Africa and supported Arab emancipation. He sent her a several-hundred-franc advance and tried to have her stories published, but could not find anyone willing to publish pro-Arab writing. Eberhardt, unfazed, continued writing; her morale lifted when Ehnni was transferred to a spahi regiment near Marseille in late August to complete his final months of service. He did not require permission from his military superiors to marry in France, and he and Eberhardt were married in October 1901. Shortly before they were married, Eberhardt and Augustin received the news that Trophimowsky's estate had finally been sold, though due to the mounting legal costs {{there was no money}} left for them to inherit. With this news, Eberhardt abandoned <b>any</b> <b>hope</b> of having a financially secure future. In February 1902 Ehnni was discharged, and the couple returned to Bône to live with his family.|$|E

5|$|Alonso {{returned}} to the team for the , where the engine was retuned to operate {{at a higher level}} of performance and the team introduced a range of aerodynamic updates including sidepod fins and a new front wing. However, Alonso and Button still qualified on the penultimate row of the grid ahead of the Manor Marussia drivers Roberto Merhi and Will Stevens. Both cars retired from the race with mechanical problems. The team did not score any points during the first round of flyaway races, struggling with poor reliability and a lack of engine performance; the Chinese Grand Prix was the only race where both cars were classified as finishing. Although Alonso repeated the team's best finish of eleventh place in Bahrain, <b>any</b> <b>hope</b> of improved performance was arrested with the start of the European season at the next round in Spain, where Button finished sixteenth and Alonso retired with brake problems.|$|E
5|$|By mid-morning, it was {{apparent}} that the failure of the New Zealanders to advance their section of the front exposed the left flank of the neighbouring 3rd Australian Division, which had secured its first objective and was pushing on to its second. Likewise, on the New Zealand Division's left, the 9th (Scottish) Division had managed to reach its final objective. Godley issued new instructions to the New Zealand Division; abandoning <b>any</b> <b>hope</b> of getting to the Green Line, it was to push on to the Blue Line in an attack timed for 3:00pm. However, by the early afternoon the flanking Scots had been pushed back while the Australians had failed to make further gains and were withdrawing due to enfilade gunfire on the flanks. Braithwaite, warned by his battalion commanders that capturing the Blue Line was impossible, twice pushed Russell for a cancellation of the attack. Russell's initial response was to instruct the Rifle Brigade to continue, but shortly before the attack was to begin, it was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Isa's {{situation}} in Armenia was precarious, however, {{as he was}} without <b>any</b> <b>hope</b> {{of support from the}} Abbasid government. Armenia was effectively left to its own devices, and the two great Christian dynasties of the Artsruni in the south and the Bagratuni in the north effectively partitioned the country and acted as independent princes. This necessitated a careful balancing act by Isa, who could not afford to alienate the various Armenian rulers, especially after his lieutenant in Azerbaijan, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahid al-Tamimi al-Yamami, rebelled in 877. Isa besieged Muhammad in the provincial capital, Bardha'a, but despite receiving aid from Ashot Bagratuni (the future King of Armenia), after 13 months of fruitless siege he was forced to abandon it. Isa then departed Armenia altogether, returning to Amid in the Diyar Bakr. Although regarded by the Armenian and Arab historians as nominal governor of Armenia until his death in 882/3, he never again left the Jazira.|$|E

5|$|Voldemort triumphantly announces Harry's {{apparent}} {{death to}} everyone at Hogwarts, and demands {{that they all}} surrender. As Neville gives a defiant response and draws the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat, Harry reveals he is still alive, causing the Malfoys and many other Death Eaters to abandon Voldemort as they realize he failed to kill Harry again, and <b>any</b> <b>hope</b> of victory for the Dark Lord is now a lost cause. While Harry battles Voldemort throughout the castle, Neville kills Nagini with the sword, leaving Voldemort vulnerable, and Molly Weasley kills Bellatrix in the Great Hall. Harry and Voldemort's battle ends with Voldemort's own Killing Curse rebounding and killing him, once and for all. After the battle, Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that the Elder Wand had recognised him as its true master because he had disarmed Draco, who earlier had disarmed its previous owner — Dumbledore — but, instead of claiming the Elder Wand, Harry breaks and discards it.|$|E
5|$|<b>Any</b> <b>hope</b> of {{resistance}} was centered on two young princes, Emperor Gong's brothers. The older boy, Zhao Shi, who {{was nine years}} old, was declared emperor on June 14, 1276, in Fuzhou. The court sought refuge in Quanzhou, seeking an alliance with the Superintendent of Maritime Shipping, the Muslim Pu Shougeng. However, he secretly formed an alliance with Kublai, so the Song court was forced to flee in 1277. The court then sought refuge in Silvermine Bay (Mui Wo) on Lantau Island. The older brother became ill and died on May 8, 1278 at age ten, and was succeeded by his younger brother who became Emperor Huaizong of Song, aged seven. The Sung Wong Toi monument in Kowloon commemorates his enthronement. On March 19, 1279 the Song army was defeated in its last battle, the Battle of Yamen, fought against the Yuan army led by the Chinese general Zhang Hongfan in the Pearl River Delta. Song Prime Minister Lu Xiufu {{is said to have}} taken the boy emperor in his arms and jumped from his sinking ship into the sea, drowning both of them.|$|E
5|$|Club {{competition}} {{paused in}} the last week of March, resuming over the first weekend of April. Benfica's first game was a visit to nearby Estádio da Reboleira to meet Estrela da Amadora. Referee Hugo Miguel called three penalties in the first half-hour: two for Benfica and one for Estrela. Cardozo converted both (in the fifth and 16th minutes), and Silvestre Varela scored for Estrela in a 2–1 final result. Sánchez Flores said that although Benfica played poorly, winning was what mattered. On 11 April, Benfica hosted Académica in another home loss; a 23rd-minute goal by William Tiero secured Académica's second consecutive away win against Benfica. The loss ended <b>any</b> <b>hope</b> of winning the title, since Porto had an eight-point lead. The race for second place (and a UEFA Champions League spot) also experienced a setback, since Sporting now had a four-point lead. The fans turned on Sánchez Flores, waving white handkerchiefs in the traditional request for resignation. The Spaniard realised that winning the Primeira Liga was nearly impossible, and Benfica should focus on qualifying for the Champions League. The club rebounded with an away win against Vitória de Setúbal. They started strong, scoring three goals in the first half for a final score of 4–0. Cardozo and Nuno Gomes scored two goals apiece. A week after Setúbal, Benfica hosted Marítimo for April's final match. By the 38th minute, the club was winning 3–0. Marítimo reacted, cutting Benfica's lead to 3–2 in the 60th minute, but the club defended their lead. Although Sánchez Flores was happy with the three points, he said that Benfica should have better controlled the game.|$|E
