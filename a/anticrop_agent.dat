5000|$|In August 1991, the UN {{carried out}} its first {{inspection}} of Iraq’s BW capabilities {{in the aftermath}} of the Gulf War. On 2 August 1991, representatives of the Iraqi government announced to leaders of UNSCOM's [...] "Team 7" [...] that they had conducted research into the offensive use of B. anthracis, botulinum toxins, and Clostridium perfringens toxins. Post-war inspections by UNSCOM, however, were confounded by misinformation and obfuscation. After Iraqi General Hussein Kamel al-Majid defected to Jordan in August 1995, the Iraqi government further disclosed that it had operated a robust BW program at six major sites since the 1980s. It was revealed that the Iraqi program conducted basic research on B. anthracis, rotavirus, camelpox virus, aflatoxin, botulinum toxins, mycotoxins, and an <b>anticrop</b> <b>agent</b> (wheat cover smut). It tested several delivery systems including aerial spray tanks and drone aircraft. The Iraqi government had weaponized 6,000 liters of B. anthracis spores and 12,000 liters of botulinum toxin in aerial bombs, rockets, and missile warheads before the outbreak of war in 1991. [...] These bio-weapons were deployed but never used.|$|E
2500|$|Stripe rust {{of wheat}} was also under investigation, {{and the usual}} {{screening}} program for chemical <b>anticrop</b> <b>agents</b> was continued. A gradual increase in {{the scope of the}} rest of the anti-crop program accompanied this development. Large scale greenhouse experiments on stripe rust of wheat yielded considerable information on the degree of crop injury in relation to the time and number of inoculations.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to Nixon’s 1969 decision, all antipersonnel biological warfare stocks were destroyed between 10 May 1971 and 1 May 1972. The laboratory at Pine Bluff Arsenal, Arkansas, was {{converted to a}} toxicological research laboratory, and was no longer under the direction or control of the DoD. Biological <b>anticrop</b> <b>agents</b> were destroyed by February 1973. Biological warfare demilitarization continued through the 1970s, with input provided by the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare; U.S. Department of the Interior; U.S. Department of Agriculture; and the Environmental Protection Agency. Fort Detrick and other installations involved in the biological warfare program took on new identities, and their missions were changed to biological defense {{and the development of}} medical countermeasures. The necessary containment capability, Biosafety Levels 3 and 4 (BSL-3 and BSL-4) continued to be maintained at USAMRIID.|$|R
5000|$|Stripe rust {{of wheat}} was also under investigation, {{and the usual}} {{screening}} program for chemical <b>anticrop</b> <b>agents</b> was continued. A gradual increase in {{the scope of the}} rest of the anti-crop program accompanied this development. Large scale greenhouse experiments on stripe rust of wheat yielded considerable information on the degree of crop injury in relation to the time and number of inoculations. Rocky Mountain Arsenal, from January 1962 to October 1969, [...] "grew, purified and militarized" [...] the plant pathogen wheat stem rust (Puccinia graminis, var. tritici) known as Agent TX for the Air Force biological anti-crop program. Agent TX-treated grain was grown at Edgewood Arsenal and from 1962-1968 in Sections 23-26 at Rocky Mountain Arsenal [...] The unprocessed agent was transported to Beale AFB in refrigerated trucks for purification and storage and was kept refrigerated until loaded into specialized bombs adapted from the Leaflet bombs used to deliver propaganda. [...] The M115 anti-crop bomb, also known as the feather bomb or the E73 bomb, was a U.S. biological cluster bomb designed to deliver wheat stem rust. [...] The deployment of the M115 represented the United States' first, though limited, anti-crop biological warfare (BW) capability.|$|R
