5|$|Finally, {{the supreme}} {{director}} Juan Martín de Pueyrredón appointed {{a commission to}} discuss the case of Saavedra. By this time, the Congress of Tucumán had made the Argentine Declaration of Independence <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>before.</b> The commission restored Saavedra with the military rank of brigadier, and ordered the payment of all the wages he did not receive during {{the time he was}} demoted. A second commission ratified the ruling. The payment was not enough to compensate Saavedra's losses, but he considered it a token of his restored prestige. He was appointed then to help with the protection of the frontier with the natives at Luján.|$|E

25|$|At {{certain times}} newsworthy events will occur (and be read out on KMVS, {{but not by}} the current DJ; instead by real life TV and radio news anchor Tony Guida). There are two {{broadcasts}} for each event: a prediction, which usually occurs <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> the actual event, and an actual bulletin. These generally shift the genre interests of the public when predicted and after occurring.|$|E

Over time the quality of Lüchow's food and service had taken a turn for the worse, with stemware abandoned in favor of short glasses, and no tablecloths at lunch, according to employees of the period.|$|E

25|$|Work on {{building}} the Great mill {{was started by}} the millwright Humphrey of Cranbrook in 1813. Owing {{to the nature of}} the ground the mill was built on it was necessary to lay deep foundations. Lack of funds meant that the mill was left as an unfinished base for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> Thomas Webb, who owned the Little Mill, bought the unfinished mill and financed its completion in 1816. A steam engine was added in 1889 as auxiliary power. The mill was worked by wind until 1905, when the sails and stage were removed. It worked by steam engine until 1918, and was demolished in 1924. The mill's brick base was left, serving as a corn store in the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Patient R.B. was a {{normally}} functioning man {{until the}} age of 52. At age 50, he had been diagnosed with angina and had surgery for heart problems on two occasions. After an ischemic episode (reduction of blood to the brain) that was caused from a heart bypass surgery, R.B. demonstrated a loss of anterograde memory, but almost no loss of retrograde memory, with the exception of <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> his surgery, and presented no sign of any other cognitive impairment. It wasn't until after his death that researchers had the chance to examine his brain, when they found his lesions were restricted to the CA1 portion of the hippocampus. This case study led to important research involving the role of the hippocampus and the function of memory.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} tenant {{of the oval}} was the North Melbourne Cricket Club. The cricket club first started playing at the ground in 1868. The cricket club began to share the oval with the football club in 1882, with the football club using the oval in winter, and the cricket club using the oval in the summer. Historically this arrangement has been difficult and the North Melbourne cricket and football clubs have not got along. In 2007, the cricket club moved its First and Second XIs playing base to J. J. Holland Park in neighbouring Kensington, but its Third and Fourth XIs remained at Arden Street; the club left Arden Street altogether in 2010, playing and training nomadically at Holland Park, Albert Park and Royal Park for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> moving permanently to the outer north-western suburb of Greenvale in 2013.|$|E

500|$|<b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>before,</b> Marcus had {{identified}} different roots underlying the band's merger {{of music and}} politics, arguing that they [...] "have absorbed from reggae and the Rastas {{the idea of a}} culture that will make demands on those in power which no government could ever satisfy; a culture that will be exclusive, almost separatist, yet also messianic, apocalyptic and stoic, and that will ignore or smash any contradiction inherent in such a complexity of stances." [...] Critic Sean Campbell has discussed how Lydon's Irish Catholic heritage both facilitated his entrée into London's reggae scene and complicated his position vis-à-vis the ethnically English working class—the background his bandmates had in common.|$|E

500|$|Cho {{was born}} on January 18, 1984, {{in the city of}} Asan, in South Korea's South Chungcheong Province. Cho and his family lived in a {{basement}} apartment in the South Korean capital of Seoul for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> immigrating to the United States. Cho's father was self-employed as a bookstore owner, but made minimum wages from the venture. Seeking better education and opportunities for his children, [...] Cho's father immigrated to the United States in September 1992 with his wife and three children. Cho was eight years old at the time. The family first lived in Detroit, then moved to the Washington metropolitan area after learning that it had one of the largest South Korean expatriate communities in the U.S., particularly in Northern Virginia. Cho's family settled in Centreville, an unincorporated community in western Fairfax County, Virginia about [...] west of Washington, D.C. Cho's father and mother opened a dry-cleaning business in Centreville. After the family moved to Centreville, Cho and his family became permanent residents of the United States as South Korean nationals. His parents became members of a local Christian church, and Cho himself was raised {{as a member of the}} religion, although he [...] "hated his parents' strong Christian faith." [...] According to one report, Cho had left a note in his dormitory which contained a rant referencing Christianity and denigrating [...] "rich kids". In a video that Cho mailed to the NBC headquarters in New York he stated, [...] "Thanks to you I die like Jesus Christ, to inspire generations of the weak and defenseless people." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{visits to}} Europe continued. Farmer moved there in 1968 and {{ultimately}} settled in Vienna, where he performed with The Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band {{and joined the}} Austrian Radio Orchestra. The latter job initially required only ten days a month of his time, so {{he was able to}} play with other well-known expatriates such as Don Byas, Dexter Gordon, and Ben Webster. As the orchestra's music gradually changed in style from jazz to simpler forms and took up more of Farmer's time, he found that it was {{getting in the way of}} his musical ambitions, so he left after three or four years. Pursuing these ambitions meant that Farmer traveled extensively worldwide. He said in 1976 that [...] "I'm traveling 90 percent of the time. I can live anywhere. It's just a matter of getting to the airport". A 1982 revival of the Jazztet, with Golson, led him to play more frequently in the United States than he had over the previous decade. In the 1980s Farmer also created a quintet, featuring saxophonist Clifford Jordan, that toured internationally. In the early 1980s, Farmer had also made some changes to his lifestyle. Interviewed for a 1985 article in The New Yorker, he reported losing 30 pounds in weight a couple of years earlier, and stopping smoking and drinking <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> that; Farmer [...] "used to think he couldn't play without drinking; now he couldn't play and drink", was the interviewer's summary of Farmer's habits, which appear to have avoided the drug-related problems of many of his contemporaries.|$|E

The last official race for factory GT1 Corvettes was the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans.|$|E
2500|$|Many ABA track {{operators}} were of {{the same}} opinion. [...] Also, since most track operators were businessmen themselves, they understood that the ABA filing for Chapter 11 protection wasn't the disastrous thing most laymen think it is. Many {{took it as a}} good thing since filing Chapter 11 would get rid of most of the executives who mismanaged the ABA in the first place, as was Gary Ellis Sr.'s opinion. They knew other companies in the industry that were in the same position as the ABA was but came out of it. The Van Doren Rubber Co., the maker of Vans tennis shoes that were then a favorite with BMX racers and freestylers and skateboarders alike, filed for bankruptcy <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> and eventually came out of it solvent. However, nearly 160 track operators did switch to the USBA, effectively splitting the world of BMX racing three ways.|$|E
