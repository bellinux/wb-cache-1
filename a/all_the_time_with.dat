James Elkins, commenting on discussions about the exact date of the {{transition}} from modernism to postmodernism, compares it to the discussion in the 1960s about the exact span of Mannerism and whether it should begin directly after the High Renaissance or later in the century. He makes the point these debates go on <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> respect to art movements and periods, {{which is not to}} say they are not important. The close of the period of postmodern art has been dated to the end of the 1980s, when the word postmodernism lost much of its critical resonance, and art practices began to address the impact of globalization and new media.|$|E

Michelle Erica Green watched the episode for TrekNation, saying that she enjoyed the episode on the whole and enjoyed the characterisation. However, she criticised the non-moving Beagle prop as it made her son think the dog was dead, which was then followed by [...] "what looks like a drowned dog in formaldehyde". Jamahl Epsicokhan reviewed the episode for his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews", giving it a score of one out of four.

500|$|As {{a result}} of the vast stores of {{information}} made accessible on the web, one hundred critics pointed to a decrease in the desire to recall certain types of information, indicating, they believed, a change in the process of recalling information, as well as the types of information that are recalled. According to Ben Worthen, a Wall Street Journal business technology blogger, the growing importance placed on the ability to access information instead of the capacity to recall information straight from memory would, in the long term, change the type of job skills that companies who are hiring new employees would find valuable. Due to an increased reliance on the Internet, Worthen speculated that before long [...] "the guy who remembers every fact about a topic may not be as valuable as the guy who knows how to find all of these facts and many others". Evan Ratliff of Salon.com wondered if the usage of gadgets to recall phone numbers, as well as geographical and historical information, had the effect of releasing certain cognitive resources that in turn strengthened other aspects of cognition. Drawing parallels with transactive memory — a process whereby people remember things in relationships and groups — Ratliff mused that perhaps the web was [...] "like a spouse who is around <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>with</b> a particular knack for factual memory of all varieties". Far from conclusive, these ruminations left the web's impact on memory retention an open question.|$|E

Potential sources include gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), core collapse supernovae (SNe), and flaring active galactic nuclei (AGNs). To enhance the sensitivity of ANTARES to such sources, a new detection method based on coincident observations of neutrinos and optical signals has been developed. A fast online muon track reconstruction is used to trigger a network of small automatic optical telescopes. Such alerts are generated twices per month for special events such as two or more neutrinos, coincident in time and direction, or single neutrinos of very high energy or in the specific directions of local galaxies. Alert triggers are followed by the TAROT, ROTSE and ZADKO optical telescopes and by the SWIFT/XRT telescopes.

40|$|The ANTARES {{observatory}} {{is currently}} the largest neutrino telescope in the Northern Hemisphere. It is well suited to detect high energy neutrinos produced in astrophysical sources as it can observe a full hemisphere of <b>the</b> sky at <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>with</b> a high duty cycle and an angular resolution about 0. 4 degrees. Due to its location in the South of France, ANTARES is sensitive to up-going neutrinos from many potential galactic sources in the TeV to PeV energy regime. Results from a time-integrated unbinned method {{as well as the}} sensitivity of the detector using 2007 - 2010 data are presented. Moreover, using a time-dependant search for the transient sources, the background rejection and point-source sensitivity can be drastically improved by selecting a narrow <b>time</b> window around <b>the</b> assumed neutrino production period. The gamma-ray light curves of blazars measured by the LAT instrument on-board the Fermi satellite reveal important time variability information. A strong correlation between the gamma-ray and the neutrino fluxes is expected in a hadronic scenario. First results on the search for ten bright and variable Fermi sources with the 2008 ANTARES data are also presented. PoS(EPS-HEP 2011) 04...|$|R

30|$|It {{is clear}} that {{periodic}} time scales are regular, so we can obtain some of their nice properties (such as the above closedness property), and introduce and study well-defined functions on them. However, most of time scales are not periodic; thus, it is necessary and meaningful to find {{an effective way to}} build bridges between periodic time scales and an arbitrary time scale. This will easily allow us to extract results known for periodic time scales to other types of time scales, and vice versa. Having this in mind, in this paper, we shall introduce a new concept, which we call ‘changing-periodic time scales’. This concept deals not only <b>with</b> almost periodic <b>time</b> scales, but also <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> scales <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bounded graininess function μ. In conclusion, we shall show that <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> scales <b>with</b> a bounded graininess function μ can be decomposed into a countable union of periodic time scales, i.e., we shall formulate a basic decomposition theorem of time scales. This result paves a way to study functions on an arbitrary <b>time</b> scale <b>with</b> bounded μ as conveniently as on periodic time scales. Next, based on changing-periodic time scales, we shall introduce ‘local-almost periodic’ and ‘local-almost automorphic’ functions and study some of their related properties. Finally, we shall apply these results to address local-almost periodicity and local-almost automorphy of solutions of dynamic equations on arbitrary <b>time</b> scales <b>with</b> bounded graininess function μ.|$|R
