40|$|Our goal is {{to measure}} blood {{viscosity}} non-invasively. We have chosen this project {{because we want to}} use our skills for the greater good of humanity. This century, there is significant research being done in the field of medical technology. The results of this research are improving {{the quality of life for}} people around the globe. Our education in engineering has given us the opportunity to participate in this cause. Objectives Currently, blood viscosity is measured by first using a needle to draw blood. This is followed by running tests on the blood sample in a lab. Our {{goal is to}} make the same measurement without the need for invasive procedures or <b>a</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>staff.</b> We will not be measuring blood viscosity directly. Instead, we will be measuring changes in blood oxygen saturation readings caused by an externally applied magnetic field. This will then lead to a measurement of blood viscosity. It must be made clear that the connection between blood oxygen saturation under a magnetic field and blood viscosity has not yet been made. This is not the focus of our project. Ultimately, we will quantify the difference in blood oxygen saturation by controlling an external magnetic field. The main components of our design are a pulse oximeter and two electromagnets.

40|$|Objective: Evidence {{shows that}} an {{elevated}} pulse pressure (PP) {{may lead to}} {{an increased risk of}} cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the effects of polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene on the PP after a first anterior acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods: Overall 116 patients with a first anterior AMI were included in this cross-sectional study. DNA was isolated from peripheral leukocytes. The ID status was determined by polymerase chain reaction by <b>a</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>staff</b> member who was unaware of the clinical details. Based on the polymorphism of the ACE gene, they were classified into 3 groups: Deletion/Deletion (DD) genotype (Group 1, n= 45), Insertion/Deletion (ID) genotype (Group 2, n= 58), Insertion/Insertion (II) genotype (Group 3, n= 13). Blood pressure measurements were performed in all patients within 10 minutes admitted to coronary care unit. The PP was calculated by subtraction of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from systolic blood pressure (SBP). Echocardiographic examinations were performed using the parasternal longitudinal axis and apical 4 -chamber windows in accordance with the recommendations of the American Echocardiography Committee. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Chi-square analyses were used to compare differences among subjects with different genotypes. Results: There were no significant differences among clinical parameters of patients. Pulse pressure was significantly higher in patients who have ACE DD and ID genotypes than in patients who have ACE II genotype (47 ± 16, 47 ± 14 and 39 ± 12, F= 3. 4, p< 0. 05). But SBP, DBP and heart rate were not significantly different among ACE DD, ACE ID and ACE II genotypes. Conclusion: Our results suggested that, ACE Gene I/D polymorphism D allele may affect PP in patients with a first anterior AMI...|$|E
40|$|A staff {{exchange}} was {{conducted for the}} mutual benefit of the Department of Energy, the Gas Research Institute (GRI), Vetco Pipeline Services Inc. (VPSI), and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. This {{staff exchange}} provided direct exposure by <b>a</b> <b>Laboratory</b> <b>staff</b> member knowledgeable in inspection, integrity assessment, and robotic capabilities of the Laboratory {{to the needs of}} the natural gas pipeline industry. The project included an assignment to the GRI Pipeline Simulation Facility (PSF) during the period preceding the commissioning of the flow loop. GRI is interested in exploiting advanced technology at the National Laboratories. To provide a sense of the market impact, it is estimated that $ 3 billion was spent in 1993 for the repair, renovation, and replacement of distribution piping. GRI has goals of saving the distribution industry $ 500 million in Operations and Maintenance costs and having an additional $ 250 M savings impact on transmission pipelines. The objectives of the project included: (1) For PNNL staff to present technology to GRI and PSF staff on non- destructive evaluation, robotics, ground penetrating radar, and risk based inspection guidelines for application to the operation and maintenance of natural gas pipelines. (2) For GRI and PSF staff to discuss with PNNL staff opportunities for improving the industrial competitiveness of operation and maintenance services. (3) To explore the basis for partnership with GRI and PSF staff on technology transfer topics. In this project, staff exchanges were conducted to GRI`s Pipeline Simulation Facility and to VPSI. PNNL. staff had access to the $ 10 M GRI Pipeline Simulation Facility (PSF) at West Jefferson, Ohio. The facility has a 4, 700 -ft. long pipe loop, an NDE laboratory, and a data analysis laboratory.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} continuously working blood culture systems in <b>a</b> discontinuous <b>laboratory</b> system. Methods: The systems used were BacT/Alert (Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC) and BACTEC NR 860 (Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Instruments, Sparks, Md) in a comparison in <b>a</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>staffed</b> 8 ½ h on Mondays to Fridays and 4 ½ h on Saturdays. Blood culture bottles (BacT/Alert aerobic and anaerobic, BACTEC NR 26 A and NR 27 A) were received thrice daily. Results: From 1824 pairs of blood culture vials, 110 clinically significant microorganisms were recovered by both BACTEC and BacT/Alert, 43 by BACTEC alone, and 33 by BacT/Alert alone. The differences between the systems in total recovery and in recovery of individual species were not statistically significant. The average detection times were 13. 36 h for BACTEC and 13. 93 h for BacT/Alert (P> 0. 1). These times represent only 35. 6 % (BACTEC) and 32. 6 % (BacT/Alert) of the total timespans from collection of blood to informing the ward of a positive result (tcrd, clinically relevant detection time). If 24 h per day blood culture processing conditions and continuous transport of vials to the laboratory had been available, these percentages would have risen to 87 % (BACTEC) and 87. 5 % (BacT/Alert). Under such ‘ideal’ conditions, ttrd could have been reduced by 22. 16 h using BACTEC and by 26. 81 h using BacT/Alert. The BacT/Alert system showed more false-positive results than the BACTEC system (80 (4. 39 %) versus 23 (1. 26 %), P< 0. 001). Conclusions: No time benefit for detection of positive blood cultures is gained with continuously measuring systems, if loading and processing of vials is organized discontinuously, as in our laboratory...|$|R

40|$|For several years, {{there have}} been discussions about using both Sanger and whole genome {{sequencing}} in clinical practice. In late 2009, the Medical College of Wisconsin initiated the infrastructure to streamline the delivery of current and emerging DNA technologies into state-of-the-art molecular diagnostics. The online publication of our initial case in Genetics of Medicine in late 2010 further intensified our efforts in this endeavor. However, being relatively new {{to the field of}} NextGen sequencing, we began with the addition of Sanger diagnostic sequencing to our already successful research core, which at that point had been in operation for almost ten years. This was a great undertaking, as typically, independent research laboratories performing cutting-edge science lack the financial resources and breadth of experience to launch their custom product or application to the diagnostic industry. An independent research laboratory is able to resolve these shortages by partnering with <b>a</b> core <b>laboratory</b> <b>staffed</b> with diagnostic expertise. Due to our lack of diagnostic experience, we quickly aligned the research core to a consortium of individuals with clinical experience to allow us to benefit from established diagnostic facilities on campus. Difficulties faced at the onset of diagnostic startup were many, including large issues such as accreditation program (CAP vs. CLIA), SOP generation and validation, competency and proficiency testing, and reimbursement, as well as smaller problems like semiannual pipette calibration, temperature monitoring, and inventory control. The purpose of this talk is to give insight into efficient ways to resolve these problems, both large and small, and transform a decade or more of research expertise into <b>a</b> viable diagnostic <b>laboratory...</b>|$|R

50|$|The Murgon butter factory's {{diversification}} into {{dairy products}} other than butter from the 1940s enhanced {{the longevity of}} SBCDA operations compared to other factories which became increasingly vulnerable to closure from the 1960s. Cheese making commenced at the factory in late 1942 in response to wartime demand, as occurred at the Kingaroy, Nanango and Wondai butter factories. While cheese making ended during or shortly after the war at most of these places, Murgon maintained this production until the 1990s. In 1948 pasteurised bottled milk sales commenced and in 1953, the earliest part of the complex was remodelled and a modern pasteurisation and bottling plant was installed. In 1950 the office was re-established in new brick and concrete premises opposite the factory in Macalister St, with the former office building operating as the co-operative's trading arm from 1951.
