The accents of {{the study}} fall upon the {{required}} form of the contemporary trends of consumer markets development necessary for expanding the conceptual base of after-sales marketing and its strategic orientation. A thorough analysis {{has been made of}} the <b>after-sales</b> <b>services</b> market as subject {{of the study}}. Identified are the aspects of after-sales consumer behavior on the market of <b>after-sales</b> <b>services.</b> Some directions and approaches to market segmentation oriented to after-sales phase are suggested. 1. THE MARKET FOR AFTER-SALE SERVICES AS A SUBJECT TO RESEARCH Current trends in development of consumer markets show a tendency towards active organization of the after-sale phase of exchange pursuing long-term commitment with consumers by fully satisfying their demands. Within the still prevailing tendency in "mainstream marketing " for strong emphasis on the before-sale phase and the sale phase itself, the necessity arises for studying the strategic and tactic dimensions of <b>after-sale</b> marketing of <b>services</b> on consumer markets. The issues related to the market for services as a whole, and that for <b>after-sale</b> <b>services</b> on the consumer market in particular, are quite different from those concerning the goods market. This difference stems from the conceptual characteristics of services such as their intangibility, inseparability of production and consumption, heterogeneity (or diversity), limited durability, etc. The growing competition on the market for <b>after-sale</b> <b>services</b> at consumer level makes it necessary to develop further the concept and the implements of the after-sale marketing of those services. The main driving force for such a development are the skills of marketing specialists, dealing with the service market sector. The marketing management of <b>after-sale</b> <b>services</b> on the consumer market sets three mutually related objectives [1]: A) To increase the competitive differentiation of <b>after-sale</b> <b>services.</b> What stands behind this is the urgent need for making the services of an organization different fro...|$|R

The two companies, with Rolls-Royce Deutschland, planned to obtain Western certification during 2008/9 and offer a Rolls-Royce BR715 powered aircraft for Western markets.

[...] However, little progress toward a Rolls-Royce version has been made since a joint study concluded in 2004 that because the intended BR715 engine would require extensive redevelopment due to weight and salt-water corrosion issues, break-even would require sales of too many aircraft.|$|E
