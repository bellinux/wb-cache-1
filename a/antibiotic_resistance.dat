5|$|In {{ordinary}} circumstances, transduction, conjugation, {{and transformation}} involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria {{of the same}} species, but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the transfer of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance.</b> In such cases, gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions. Gene transfer is particularly important in <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance</b> as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens.|$|E

5|$|Oral {{antibiotics}} {{are recommended}} for {{no longer than}} three months as antibiotic courses exceeding this duration {{are associated with the}} development of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance</b> and show no clear benefit over shorter courses. Furthermore, if long-term oral antibiotics beyond three months are thought to be necessary, it is recommended that benzoyl peroxide and/or a retinoid be used {{at the same time to}} limit the risk of P. acnes developing <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance.</b> Dapsone is not a first-line topical antibiotic due to higher cost and lack of clear superiority over other antibiotics. Topical dapsone is not recommended for use with benzoyl peroxide due to yellow-orange skin discoloration with this combination.|$|E
40|$|Background <b>Antibiotics</b> <b>resistance</b> is a {{major public}} health threat worldwide. Super bugs, for example, drug {{resistant}} tuberculosis or Staphylococcus aureus, are increasingly common in the communities. Hong Kong {{is one of the}} areas which have the highest antibiotics resistant strains prevalence rate in the world. Irrational use of antibiotics is an important contributing factor to the emergence of <b>antibiotics</b> <b>resistance.</b> Physician stewardship in the prescription of antibiotics is pivotal in the prevention of <b>antibiotics</b> <b>resistance</b> emergence. Medical students are going to be practicing doctors after graduation from medical school. But few studies had been conducted to investigate their knowledge and attitude towards <b>antibiotics</b> <b>resistance</b> and use, and relations with anticipated antibiotics prescription behaviour. Method 145 medical students at the University of Hong Kong were recruited in this study to complete a self-administered questionnaire. There were in total 14 questions in this questionnaire, covering 2 major themes 1. Self-report of current and past antibiotic use and behaviour; 2. Anticipated prescription behaviour of antibiotics upon graduation and practice in the future. Chi-square test was used to investigate the association between attitude and knowledge of antibiotics with their anticipated prescription behavior upon graduation and practice. Multivariable logistic regression model was used to adjust for potential confounders. Results 67. 6 % of the participants hold the correct knowledge of the proper use of antibiotics. Compare with the participants who hold the wrong knowledge, they were to 0. 18 times more likely to inappropriately prescribe antibiotics for non-complicated Upper respiratory tract infections (URTI). (OR: 0. 18, 95 % CI: (0. 08, 0. 43); p < 0. 001). Respectively 33. 6 % and 4. 9 % of all the participants perceived the severity of <b>antibiotics</b> <b>resistance</b> in Hong Kong as “Severe” and “Very severe “. Those who rated “Severe” or above were 0. 37 times more likely to inappropriately prescribe antibiotics for non-complicated URTIs compared with the participants who rated “Neutral” or below. (OR: 0. 37, 95 % CI: (0. 15, 0. 91); p = 0. 03). Logistic regression model was employed to test the interaction effect. Result showed that clinical training significantly interacted with antibiotics knowledge (p < 0. 01) and perceived severity of <b>antibiotics</b> <b>resistance</b> (p = 0. 02) in their relations with inappropriate prescription for non-complicated URTIs. Conclusion For the medical students who have received clinical training, those who were more aware of the severity of <b>antibiotics</b> <b>resistance</b> in Hong Kong were less likely to inappropriately prescribe antibiotics for non-complicated URTI. For the medical students who have not received clinical training, correct knowledge of antibiotic use is associated with less inappropriate antibiotics prescription behaviour. These suggest that knowledge and attitude towards <b>antibiotics</b> <b>resistance</b> and use are important factors that may impact on physician stewardship in antibiotics use in the community. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R

5|$|For {{those with}} {{recurrent}} infections, taking a short course of antibiotics when each infection occurs {{is associated with}} the lowest antibiotic use. A prolonged course of daily antibiotics is also effective. Medications frequently used include nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Methenamine is another agent used for this purpose as in the bladder where the acidity is low it produces formaldehyde to which resistance does not develop. Some recommend against prolonged use due to concerns of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|E
5|$|Horizontal gene {{transfer}} {{refers to the}} transfer of genetic material through a mechanism other than reproduction. This mechanism is a common source of new genes in prokaryotes, sometimes thought to contribute more to genetic variation than gene duplication.

5|$|A common {{claim of}} creationists is that {{evolution}} {{has never been}} observed. Challenges to such objections often come down to debates over how evolution is defined (see the Defining evolution section above). Under the conventional biological definition of evolution, {{it is a simple}} matter to observe evolution occurring. Evolutionary processes, in the form of populations changing their genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the evolution of fruit flies, mice, and bacteria in the laboratory, and of tilapia in the field. Such studies on experimental evolution, particularly those using microorganisms, are now providing important insights into how evolution occurs, {{especially in the case of}} <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|E
5|$|Biotechnology in {{the modern}} sense of genetic {{engineering}} began in the 1970s, with the invention of recombinant DNA techniques. Restriction enzymes were discovered and characterized in the late 1960s, following {{on the heels of}} the isolation, then duplication, then synthesis of viral genes. Beginning with the lab of Paul Berg in 1972 (aided by EcoRI from Herbert Boyer's lab, building on work with ligase by Arthur Kornberg's lab), molecular biologists put these pieces together to produce the first transgenic organisms. Soon after, others began using plasmid vectors and adding genes for <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance,</b> greatly increasing the reach of the recombinant techniques.|$|E
5|$|Combination therapy—using {{medications}} {{of different}} classes together, {{each with a}} different mechanism of action—has been demonstrated {{to be a more}} efficacious approach to acne treatment than monotherapy. The use of topical benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics together {{has been shown to be}} more effective than antibiotics alone. Similarly, using a topical retinoid with an antibiotic clears acne lesions faster than the use of antibiotics alone. Frequently used combinations include the following: antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide, antibiotic and topical retinoid, or topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide. The pairing of benzoyl peroxide with a retinoid is preferred over the combination of a topical antibiotic with a retinoid since both regimens are effective but benzoyl peroxide does not lead to <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|E

5|$|Geneticists {{often use}} viruses as vectors to {{introduce}} genes into cells {{that they are}} studying. This is useful for making the cell produce a foreign substance, or to study the effect of introducing a new gene into the genome. In similar fashion, virotherapy uses viruses as vectors to treat various diseases, as they can specifically target cells and DNA. It shows promising use {{in the treatment of}} cancer and in gene therapy. Eastern European scientists have used phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics for some time, and interest in this approach is increasing, because of the high level of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance</b> now found in some pathogenic bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Toxin-antitoxin {{systems are}} {{typically}} classified {{according to how}} the antitoxin neutralises the toxin. In a Type I toxin-antitoxin system, the translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) that encodes the toxin is inhibited by the binding of a small non-coding RNA antitoxin to the mRNA. The protein toxin in a type II system is inhibited post-translationally by the binding of another protein antitoxin. A single example of Type III toxin-antitoxin system has been described whereby a protein toxin is bound directly by an RNA molecule. Toxin-antitoxin genes are often transferred through horizontal gene transfer and are associated with pathogenic bacteria, having been found on plasmids conferring <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance</b> and virulence.|$|E
5|$|Adaptation {{may cause}} either the gain {{of a new}} feature, or the loss of an ancestral feature. An example that shows both types of change is {{bacterial}} adaptation to antibiotic selection, with genetic changes causing <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance</b> by both modifying {{the target of the}} drug, or increasing the activity of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell. Other striking examples are the bacteria Escherichia coli evolving the ability to use citric acid as a nutrient in a long-term laboratory experiment, Flavobacterium evolving a novel enzyme that allows these bacteria to grow on the by-products of nylon manufacturing, and the soil bacterium Sphingobium evolving an entirely new metabolic pathway that degrades the synthetic pesticide pentachlorophenol. An interesting but still controversial idea is that some adaptations might increase the ability of organisms to generate genetic diversity and adapt by natural selection (increasing organisms' evolvability).|$|E

5|$|Animals are {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} diseases and conditions that may affect their health. Some, like classical swine fever and scrapie are specific to one type of stock, while others, like foot-and-mouth disease affect all cloven-hoofed animals. Where the condition is serious, governments impose regulations on import and export, on the movement of stock, quarantine restrictions and the reporting of suspected cases. Vaccines are available against certain diseases, and antibiotics are widely used where appropriate. At one time, antibiotics were routinely added to certain compound foodstuffs to promote growth, but this practice is now frowned on in many countries because of the risk that it may lead to <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance.</b> Animals living under intensive conditions are particularly prone to internal and external parasites; increasing numbers of sea lice are affecting farmed salmon in Scotland. Reducing the parasite burdens of livestock results in increased productivity and profitability.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{transfer}} between species {{includes the}} formation of hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer. Horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring; this is most common among bacteria. In medicine, this contributes {{to the spread of}} <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance,</b> as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species. Horizontal transfer of genes from bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the adzuki bean weevil Callosobruchus chinensis has occurred. An example of larger-scale transfers are the eukaryotic bdelloid rotifers, which have received a range of genes from bacteria, fungi and plants. Viruses can also carry DNA between organisms, allowing transfer of genes even across biological domains.|$|E
5|$|H. pylori is a {{major cause}} of certain {{diseases}} of the upper gastrointestinal tract.

Researchers are studying different adjuvants, antigens, and routes of immunization to ascertain the most appropriate system of immune protection; however, most of the research only recently moved from animal to human trials. An economic evaluation of the use of a potential H. pylori vaccine in babies found its introduction could, at least in the Netherlands, prove cost-effective for the prevention of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer. A similar approach has also been studied for the United States.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Antibiotics</b> <b>resistance</b> poses a {{significant}} problem in today’s hospital care. Although large amounts of resistance data are gathered locally, they can-not be compared globally due to format and access diversity. We present an ontology-based integration approach serving an EU project in making <b>antibiotics</b> <b>resistance</b> data semantically and geographically interopera-ble. We particularly focus on EU-wide clinical data integration for real-time an-tibiotic resistance surveillance. The data semantics is formalized by multiple layers of terminology-bound description logic ontologies. Local database-to-RDF (D 2 R) converters, normalizers and data wrapper ontologies render hospi-tal data accessible to SPARQL queries, which populate a mediator layer. This semiformal data is then integrated and rendered comparable via formal OWL domain ontologies and rule-driven reasoning applications. The presented inte-gration layer enables clinical data miners to query over multiple hospitals which behave like one homogeneous ‘virtual clinical information system’. We show how cross-site querying can be achieved across borders, languages and differen...|$|R
