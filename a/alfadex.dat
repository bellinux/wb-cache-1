40|$|Release of {{nitric oxide}} and TNF-alpha, a toxic cytokine, have been {{reported}} to accelerate neuronal damage under several pathological conditions, such as trauma or ischemia in the central nervous system. In the present study, we tested the effect of alprostadil <b>alfadex,</b> a prostaglandin E I analog, on cultured microglia from the rat spinal cord. The cultured microglia were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 ng/ml), an endotoxin, for 24 h, then the released nitric oxide and TNF- alpha in the culture media was analyzed. The released nitric oxide was detected by the Griess reaction and released TNF- alpha was measured using ELISA method. The LPS-induced nitric oxide release was inhibited by the simultaneous addition of alprostadil <b>alfadex</b> in a dose-dependent manner (0. 1 - 100 muM). The LPS-induced TNF-alpha release was also inhibited by alprostadil <b>alfadex</b> addition (0. 1 - 100 muM). The IC 50 values of alprostadil <b>alfadex</b> on nitric oxide and TNF-alpha release were about 1 and 10 muM, respectively. These results suggest that prostaglandin El possibly protects spinal cord neurons from several types of neurodegenerative damage, not only via increased blood supply, but also via inhibition of pathological immunoreactions of activated microglia.

40|$|A 58 -year-old woman {{suffered}} from left pyelonephritis with diabetic triopathy on admission {{at which time}} a double J stent was inserted in the left ureter and was left untreated for a year. She was admitted due to fever,thirst,polydipsia,polyuria and,left 1, 2 -toe ulcer and vacuole. We diagnosed diabetic foot infections. We used 6 g of ampicillin-sulbactum and 40 Î¼g of alprostadil <b>alfadex</b> daily in addition to diet and insulin therapy for diabetes mellitus. As the toe lesion deteriorated, a left foot amputation was performed at the 11 th day. The subfever continued and the consciousness level deteriorated from alert to 100 on the Japan coma scale and acute respiratory failure occurred 21 days after operation. Whole body computed tomography showed invasive lesions in bilateral pulmonary lower lobes and renal pelvic dilatation and perirenal abscess in left kidney indicating renal abscess. Milk-like urine was excreted. Urine and blood culture detected Candida glabrata. Fundoscopic exam showed retinal exudates indicating mycotic endophthalmitis. We diagnosed candida glabrata sepsis from pyelonephritis. After using 200 mg of micafungin daily, the patient recovered. In addition to exchanging the stent, treatment of diabetes mellitus {{is important for the}} prevention of severe infection...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Adverse event reports (AERs) {{submitted}} to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were reviewed to assess the bleeding complications induced by the administration of antiplatelets and to attempt to determine the rank-order of the association. Methods: After a deletion of duplicated submissions and the revision of arbitrary drug names, AERs involving warfarin, aspirin, cilostazol, clopidogrel, ethyl icosapentate, limaprost <b>alfadex,</b> sarpogrelate, and ticlopidine were analyzed. Authorized pharmacovigilance tools {{were used for the}} quantitative detection of signals, i. e., drug-associated adverse events, including the proportional reporting ratio, the reporting odds ratio, the information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean. Results: Based on 22, 017, 956 co-occurrences, i. e., drug-adverse event pairs, found in 1, 644, 220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, 736 adverse events were listed as warfarin-associated adverse events, and 147 of the 736 were bleeding complications, including haemorrhage and haematoma. Both aspirin and clopidogrel were associated with haemorrhage, but the association was more noteworthy for clopidogrel. As for bleeding complications related to the gastrointestinal system, e. g., melaena and haematochezia, the statistical metrics suggested a stronger association for aspirin than clopidogrel. The total number of co-occurrences was not large enough to compare the association with bleeding complications for the other 5 antiplatelets. Conclusions: The data strongly suggest the necessity of well-organized clinical studies with respect to antiplatelet-associated bleeding complications. </p...|$|E
