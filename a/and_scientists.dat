5|$|For {{the most}} part the player battles through the game alone, but is {{occasionally}} assisted by non-player characters; specifically security guards <b>and</b> <b>scientists</b> who help the player; the guards will fight alongside the player, and both guards <b>and</b> <b>scientists</b> can assist in reaching new areas and impart relevant plot information. A wide array of alien enemies populate the game, including headcrabs, bullsquids, headcrab zombies, and Vortigaunts. The player also faces human opponents, in particular, Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (HECU) Marines and black ops assassins who are dispatched to contain the extra-dimensional threats and silence all witnesses.|$|E

5|$|Before modern whaling {{began in}} the late 19th century, blue whales were obscure and very poorly understood. They, along with other large whales were mythologized and indistinguishable from sea monsters. Even after the first {{specimens}} were described, the blue whale went by many names <b>and</b> <b>scientists</b> often described their specimens as new species. Descriptions and illustrations were inaccurate. The taxonomy was eventually resolved, but many mysteries remained.|$|E

5|$|Faced {{with these}} {{proposals}} to examine nuclear {{power as a}} possible response to climate change, anti-nuclear campaigners <b>and</b> <b>scientists</b> in Australia emphasised claims that nuclear power could not significantly substitute for other power sources, and that uranium mining itself could become {{a significant source of}} greenhouse gas emissions. Anti-nuclear campaigns were given added impetus by public concern about the sites for possible reactors: fears exploited by anti-nuclear power political parties in the lead-up to a national election in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Higher {{education}} in the city {{can be traced back}} to the second half of the eighteenth century, when the ownership of the city was inherited by Field Crown Hetman Jan Klemens Branicki.

5|$|Horticulturists <b>and</b> <b>scientists</b> Rodger Elliot and David L. Jones have {{proposed}} that cultivating the plant would aid in its conservation. Cultivating the plant would most likely require good water drainage, a sunny or part-shaded position and acidic soil. P.terminalis is hardy to heavy frosts, {{and is expected to}} fare better in a temperate rather than subtropical garden climate. Propagation would theoretically be by seed or by taking cuttings of new growth, though plants of the genus Persoonia as a genus are generally difficult to propagate by any means in cultivation.|$|E

5|$|In {{the decades}} after Otto Jesse's death in 1901, {{there were few}} new {{insights}} into the nature of noctilucent clouds.
