40|$|This study {{examined}} post-dispersal seed predation and soil seed reserves in four remnant populations of E. salmonophloia {{in the central}} wheatbelt of Western Australia {{to determine the effect}} of these factors on recruitment. Diurnal observations of post-dispersal seed predation at regular intervals of 2 months were undertaken over a 12 month period using <b>artificial</b> <b>baits.</b> Four species of ants were seen removing seeds from <b>artificial</b> <b>baits</b> regularly. Surveys of soil seed reserves revealed that E. salmonophloia does not form a soil seed bank despite a continual seed rain from canopy seed reserves. These observations suggest that ants probably destroy a large proportion of E. salmonophloia seed following dispersal. Burial of E. salmonophloia seeds in the soil in autumn, winter, spring and summer suggest that any seeds which do escape predation are unlikely to persist in the soil for much longer than 12 months and probably germinate with the onset of winter rains. Both the depredation of seeds by ants and the short term viability of seed in the soil contribute to the inability of E. salmonophloia to form a soil seed reserve...|$|R

40|$|Some {{investigations}} on {{the five}} kinds of <b>artificial</b> <b>bait</b> of Vinyl Chloride shaped like a flying fish were {{carried out by the}} “Keiten Maru”, Training Ship of the Faculty of Fisheries, Kagoshima University, in the sea-fronts spreading over 1 °- 00 ’N~ 3 °- 00 ’S and 93 °- 00 ’E~ 95 °- 00 ’E, during the term from May 31 to June 23 1969. The material, length, form, and colour of the five kinds of <b>artificial</b> <b>bait,</b> are as shown in Fig. 1 and Table 2. A series of investigation were conducted in order to compare its efficiency with the real bait fish. The results obtained are as follows : 1) As shown in “C” and “D”, of the five kinds of <b>artificial</b> <b>bait,</b> the best hooked rate is 0. 67 %, and as shown in “B” and “E”, this is followed by the hooked rate of 0. 33 %, the last “A” being 0. 17 %. 2) According to the investigations on the <b>artificial</b> <b>bait</b> and the frozen Saury bait, the total hooked rate of the <b>artificial</b> <b>bait,</b> compared with that of the frozen Saury, was confirmed to be only one fifth. 3) The hooked rate of the first fifty baskets of the long line against that of the second fifty baskets next to the first ones was confirmed to be one half. Hence, it was assumed that the position in which the long line was attatched had close relationship with the hooking rate of the <b>artificial</b> <b>bait.</b> 4) It was assumed that the possibility of the artificial bait’s being left-out or damaged, was to be related not only {{to the quality of the}} <b>artificial</b> <b>bait,</b> but to the way the hook was fixed and handled; some faults were observed while the long line was being set out or hauled up. 5) Fading in the artificial-bait-colour was occasioned in the operation, but no difference was to be caused in the hooking rate. 6) It has some faults in handling at the setting and hauling work of long line. ...|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} catch and release vary from species to species. A study of fish caught {{in shallow water}} on the Great Barrier Reef showed high {{survival}} rates (97%+) (e.g.) for released fish if handled correctly and particularly if caught on <b>artificial</b> <b>baits</b> such as lures. Fish caught on lures are usually hooked cleanly in the mouth, minimizing injury and aiding release. Other studies have shown somewhat lower survival rates for fish gut-hooked on bait if the line is cut and the fish is released without trying to remove the hook.|$|R
40|$|The role of {{olfaction}} in the host-oriented behaviour of tsetse is reviewed. For all tsetse, odours {{play a role}} in host location but {{the relative}} importance of olfactory stimuli varies between species. For Morsitans-group tsetse such as Glossina pallidipes and G. m. morsitans, host odours elicit longrange (~ 100 m) orientation whereas Palpalis group species such as G. palpalis spp. And G. fuscipes spp. while showing significant olfactory responses, are much less responsive. Hence baiting traps with natural host odours can increase the catch of some Morsitans tsetse ten-fold compared to only a doubling with Palpalis tsetse. Species that are less sensitive to odours seem to be more responsive to visual stimuli. The semiochemicals present in host odours include carbon dioxide, 1 -octen- 3 -ol, acetone, butanone, 4 -methylphenol and 3 -n-propylphenol. For Morsitans tsetse, odours from hosts are not, in general, significantly different from those of non-hosts and thus olfaction does not seem {{to play an important role}} in host selection. The notable exception to this is human odour which is repellent to some species of Morsitans tsetse. Traps and insecticide-treated targets baited with blend of 1 -octenol- 3 -ol, ketones and phenols are, arguably, the most successful application of <b>artificial</b> <b>baits</b> to vector control worldwide. The current use and future prospects of using natural and <b>artificial</b> <b>baits</b> to control tsetse are discussed...|$|R
25|$|The {{shape of}} the hook shank can vary widely from merely {{straight}} {{to all sorts of}} curves, kinks, bends and offsets. These different shapes contribute in some cases to better hook penetration, fly imitations or bait holding ability. Many hooks intended to hold dead or <b>artificial</b> <b>baits</b> have sliced shanks which create barbs for better baiting holding ability. Jig hooks are designed to have lead weight molded onto the hook shank. Hook descriptions may also include shank length as standard, extra long, 2XL, short, etc. and wire size such as fine wire, extra heavy, 2X heavy, etc.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{effect of}} catch-and-release fishing on the {{survival}} of peacock bass (Cichla spp.) was evaluated by comparing two types of <b>artificial</b> <b>bait</b> (jig and shallow-diver plugs) and two types of post-catch confinement. Two experiments were conducted during the periods January-February and October-November 2012 in the Unini River, a right-bank tributary of the Negro River. In total, 191 peacock bass were captured. Both groups of fish were subjected to experimental confinement (collective and individual) for three days. Additionally, 11 fish were tagged with radio transmitters for telemetry monitoring. Mortality rate was estimated {{as the percentage of}} dead individuals for each type of bait and confinement. For peacock bass caught with jig baits, mortality was zero. The corresponding figure for shallow-diver bait was 1. 66 % for fish in collective containment, 18. 18 % for fish monitored by telemetry and 0 % for individuals confined individually. Our results show low post-release mortality rates for peacock bass. Furthermore, neither the type of confinement nor the type of bait had a statistically significant influence on mortality rates. While future studies could include other factors in the analysis, our results show that catch-and-release fishing results in low mortality rates...|$|E
40|$|Bienertia sinuspersici is a {{terrestrial}} plant that performs C 4 photosynthesis within individual cells through operating a carbon concentrating mechanism between different subcellular domains including {{two types of}} chloroplasts. It is currently unknown how differentiation of two highly specialized chloroplasts within the same cell occurs as no similar cases have been reported. Here we show that this differentiation in photosynthetic cells of B. sinuspersici is enabled by a transit peptide (TP) mediated selective protein targeting mechanism. Mutations in the TPs cause loss of selectivity but not general loss of chloroplast import, indicating the mechanism operates by specifically blocking protein accumulation in one chloroplast type. Hybrid studies indicate that this selectivity is transferable to transit peptides of plants which perform C 4 by cooperative function of chloroplasts between two photosynthetic cells. Codon swap experiments as well as introducing an <b>artificial</b> <b>bait</b> mRNA show that RNA affects are not crucial for the sorting process. In summary, our analysis shows how the mechanism of subcellular targeting to form two types of chloroplast within the same cell can be achieved. This information is not only crucial for understanding single-cell C 4 photosynthesis; it provides new insights in control of subcellular protein targeting in cell biology. DFG/OF 106 / 1 -...|$|E
