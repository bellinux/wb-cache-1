[...] They revealed the Comintern's close supervision of the Communist Party and Pollitt. Among other things, Pollitt was instructed to refute news leaks about a Stalinist purge. [...] Some messages were addressed to code names, while others were signed by Pollitt himself. In his transmissions to Moscow, Pollitt regularly pleaded for more funding from the Soviet Union. One 1936 coded instruction advised Pollitt to publicise the plight of Ernst Thälmann, a German communist leader who had been arrested by the Nazis and who later died at Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Pollitt replied that he was 'having difficulties' getting English statesmen to make public declarations supporting Thälmann but that they promised they would speak privately with German officials in London.

We say unwilling, because Billy, during his long period of convalescence, had been so won by the kindness of Nora, that the last thing in the world he would have consented to bear was separation from her; but, on thinking over it, he was met by this insurmountable difficulty--that the last thing in the world he would consent to do was to disobey her!

There is point and meaning in the apparently insignificant line (stanza xxiv. line 765), [...] "We have heard the hearers say" [...] (see variant i. p. 483), which is slipped into the description of the final catastrophe.

She was, however, singularly beautiful, and as singularly cold. It was perhaps this quality, and her evident annoyance at some unreasoning prepossession which Jack's fascinations exercised upon her, that heightened that reckless desire for risk and excitement which really made up the greater part of his gallantry. Nevertheless, as was his habit, he had treated her always with a charming unconsciousness of his own attentions, and a frankness that seemed inconsistent with any insidious approach. In fact, Mr. Hamlin seldom made love to anybody, but permitted it to be made to him with good-humored deprecation and cheerful skepticism. He had once, quite accidentally, while riding, come upon her when she had strayed from her own riding party, and had behaved with such unexpected circumspection and propriety, not to mention a certain thoughtful abstraction,--it was the day he had received Sophy's letter,--that she was constrained to make the first advances. This led to a later innocent rendezvous, in which Mrs. Camperly was impelled to confide to Mr. Hamlin the fact that her husband had really never understood her. Jack listened with an understanding and sympathy quickened by long experience of such confessions. If anything had ever kept him from marriage it was this evident incompatibility of the conjugal relations with a just conception of the feminine soul and its aspirations.|$|E

Together with three NGOs (ICAP, RADI and PIC) they have developed some simple and inexpensive techniques to restore salinated rice fields in mangrove areas. First come the earthworks: dikes are built around the rice paddy, with removable plugs made of stakes, tressed branches or pressed earth to allow the paddy to flood and be drained. Then tree trunks are left to rot in the water, to be hollowed out and used as pipes. The salt is collected through a biological process: a mulch of straw and rice hulls is applied to the flooded plot, which is then drained. When the remaining moisture evaporates, the salt forms in crystals on the straw. These improved techniques mean that local families have a year-round supply of food. The villages of central Casamance have indeed benefitted from the experience of their Guinean neighbours. - Lamine Biaye AJAC/Kolda BP 11, Sédhiou, SenegalA <b>recent</b> study <b>visit</b> by {{the leaders of}} the AgroBio AJAC/Kolda project (based in central Casamance, Senegal) to the famous Balante rice farmers of Guinea Bissa...|$|R
