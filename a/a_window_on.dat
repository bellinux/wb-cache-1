5|$|At {{some point}} in the 18th century, {{possibly}} in 1753, the upper and lower halves of the tower were divided into two separate areas. The spiral staircase from the ground floor kitchen to the upper floors, holding the records, was removed, and <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>on</b> the first floor was turned into a doorway so that the upper floors could be accessed from the neighbouring house. A fire-resistant stone vaulted ceiling was installed in on the first floor, possibly also in 1753 at a cost of £350.|$|E
5|$|There {{are small}} {{enclosed}} chambers {{to either side}} of the centre chapel. The chapel of St Padarn is on the left, with an imitation pointed vault and slate slab floor. In the entrance to the chapel there is <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>on</b> the left side depicting scenes from the manuscript Life of Padarn. The single-light window with various figures, scenes and motifs is by Elizabeth Edmundson, and dates from 1988. It includes Teilo, Padarn and Dewi (David) at the top, a healing by St Samson, Maelgwn, Arthur and Caradog, two kings of Ireland on horseback and a figure with the Virgin and Child. The figures are mostly modelled on figures from the Book of St Chad. In the chapel itself, which has a low slate altar stone and seat, is a porcelain relief sculpture by Gillian Still showing a story from the Life, the ordeal by boiling water. The chapel is lit only by two small windows (one with red glass, the other green) into the central chapel. Neither the altar stone in the larger room nor that in the chapel of St Padarn have been consecrated so neither are strictly speaking altars, and neither can be used for a Eucharistic service.|$|E

25|$|The Cathedral has a {{prominent}} role in determining the beginning of the Pisan New Year. Between the tenth century and 1749, when the Tuscan calendar was reformed, Pisa used its own calendar, in which {{the first day of the}} year was March 25, the feast day of the Annunciation of Mary. Years were counted such that the Pisan New Year begins 9 months before the ordinary one. The exact moment is determined by a ray of sun that, through <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>on</b> the left side, falls on an egg-shaped marble, just above the pulpit by Giovanni Pisano; this occurs at noon.|$|E

25|$|McWilliams was {{a regular}} {{contributor}} to Moorman's Annual Avant Garde Festival of New York (1963–1980), a series of fifteen events that presented experimental art, music, and performance. In 1966, he took part in the 4th festival, held in New York's Central Park, with a work entitled American Picnic, an audience participation piece that addressed the issue of overconsumption. For the 1967 festival, held aboard a Staten Island ferry boat, he and a group of students dressed in wet suits, headlamps, and red face paint and slithered along the boat's deck in a work called Slow Dance on the Ferry. For the 1977 festival, he installed Meandering Yellow Line in the World Trade Center's north tower: a vertical necklace of blinking yellow lights installed in <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>on</b> each of the tower's 107 floors.|$|E
25|$|Vermeer's {{mother-in-law}} Maria Thins owned Dirck van Baburen's 1622 oil-on-canvas The Procuress (or {{a copy of}} it), {{which appears}} {{in the background of}} two of Vermeer's paintings. The same subject was also painted by Vermeer. Almost all of Vermeer's paintings are of contemporary subjects in a smaller format, with a cooler palette dominated by blues, yellows, and grays. Practically all of his surviving works belong to this period, usually domestic interiors with one or two figures lit by <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>on</b> the left. They are characterized by a sense of compositional balance and spatial order, unified by a pearly light. Mundane domestic or recreational activities are imbued with a poetic timelessness (e.g., Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window, Dresden, Gemäldegalerie). Vermeer's two townscapes have also been attributed to this period: View of Delft (The Hague, Mauritshuis) and A street in Delft (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum).|$|E
25|$|A body of {{correspondence}} between Marcus' tutor Fronto and various Antonine officials (with {{a focus on}} Marcus himself) survives {{in a series of}} patchy manuscripts, covering the period from c. 138 to 166. Marcus' own Meditations offer <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>on</b> his inner life, but are largely undateable, and make few specific references to worldly affairs. The main narrative source for the period is Cassius Dio, a Greek senator from Bithynian Nicaea who wrote a history of Rome from its founding to 229 in eighty books. Dio is vital for the military history of the period, but his senatorial prejudices and strong opposition to imperial expansion obscure his perspective. Some other literary sources provide specific detail: the writings of the physician Galen on the habits of the Antonine elite, the orations of Aelius Aristides on the temper of the times, and the constitutions preserved in the Digest and Codex Justinianus on Marcus' legal work. Inscriptions and coin finds supplement the literary sources.|$|E

25|$|Questioned at {{the scene}} by four officers, Bryson {{initially}} claimed he had been hitchhiking when abducted by Berdella, who had kidnapped, raped, and tortured him for four days before {{he had managed to}} escape by jumping from <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>on</b> {{the second floor of the}} property. Furthermore, this individual had kept him bound to a bed on the second floor of the house throughout much of the time he had been held against his will, repeatedly sodomizing him, drugging him, and injecting his throat with drain cleaner to diminish his ability to speak loudly. As Bryson spoke, the officers also noted that in addition to the dog collar and broken foot, Bryson had red, swollen eyes, and visible scars and welts across his entire body. Two officers were told to maintain a discreet surveillance of the property, as Bryson was driven to the Menorah Medical Center, accompanied by a third officer, for treatment as the fourth officer radioed the Kansas City Police Department to request a formal search warrant of the property be drafted.|$|E

Later additions date to post-1711 and improvements to c. 1911.|$|E
