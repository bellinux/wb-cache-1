5|$|A major dilemma {{faced by}} Morales' {{administration}} {{was between the}} desire to expand extractive industries in order to fund social programs and provide employment, {{and to protect the}} country's environment from the pollution caused by those industries.

5|$|The {{death of}} Britain's Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901 left King George as the second-longest-reigning monarch in Europe. His always cordial {{relations}} with his brother-in-law, the new King Edward VII, continued to tie Greece to Britain. This was abundantly important in Britain's support of King George's son Prince George as Governor-General of Crete.

5|$|Afterwards, {{seventeen}} {{people were}} indicted {{by a federal}} grand jury and five were found guilty of wilfully interfering with a marshal in performance of his duties (Braden, Patterson, Pryor, Purcell, and John J. Doyle, <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Settler's League). They were convicted in federal court (with Judge Sawyer presiding) and sentenced to eight months in prison and fined $300 each. Their time spent in imprisonment was hardly difficult. Three of the men's wives were allowed to live with them, and Susan Curtis, daughter of one of the jailers, fell in love with and later married Braden. Upon their release in September 1881, they were greeted by a joyous crowd of 3,000 in Hanford. Such was the anti-railroad sentiment that the five were looked upon as heroes by many across California, and those killed were considered martyrs who had given their lives for a cause.|$|E
5|$|At {{its height}} {{during the period}} of Ravalomanana's presidency, Tiko {{provided}} direct salaried employment to between 1,000 and 3,000 staff and indirect employment to over 10,000. The group was the largest dairy producer in the country and <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> national agribusiness sector. The success of his enterprises made Ravalomanana a wealthy man. In the mandatory self-disclosure of wealth submitted to the High Constitutional Court in 2000 by all presidential candidates, Ravalomanana declared ownership of 27 properties valued at over two billion Malagasy francs. He owned 90 per cent of Tiko Inc., 80 per cent of Tiko Agri and 50 per cent of Tiko Oil Products, a portfolio worth 13.1 billion Malagasy francs, and declared 77 million Malagasy francs in annual revenues. Vivier (2007) demonstrates that the valuation of Ravalomanana's holdings and his annual revenue in particular were significantly underestimated.|$|E

5|$|Henry III granted Kenilworth in 1244 to Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, {{who later}} became <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Second Barons' War (1263–67) against the king, using Kenilworth as the centre of his operations. Initially the {{conflict}} went badly for King Henry, and after the Battle of Lewes in 1264 {{he was forced to}} sign the Mise of Lewes, under which his son, Prince Edward, was given over to the rebels as a hostage. Edward was taken back to Kenilworth, where chroniclers considered he was held in unduly harsh conditions. Released in early 1265, Edward then defeated Montfort at the Battle of Evesham; the surviving rebels under the leadership of Henry de Hastings, Montfort's constable at Kenilworth, regrouped at the castle the following spring. Edward's forces proceeded to lay siege to the rebels.|$|E
5|$|In 1777, the Revolutionary War {{intensified}} in Kentucky. British {{lieutenant governor}} Henry Hamilton armed his Indian allies from his headquarters at Fort Detroit, {{encouraging them to}} wage war on the Kentucky settlers in hopes of reclaiming the region as their hunting ground. The Continental Army could spare no men for an invasion in the northwest or {{for the defense of}} Kentucky, which was left entirely to the local population. Clark spent several months defending settlements against the Indian raiders as <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky County militia, while developing his plan for a long-distance strike against the British. His strategy involved seizing British outposts north of the Ohio River to destroy British influence among their Indian allies.|$|E

Upon returning, Kennedy became <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> push for economic sanctions against South Africa; collaborating with Senator Lowell Weicker, he secured Senate passage, and the overriding of Reagan's veto, of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986. Despite their many political differences, Kennedy and Reagan had a good personal relationship, and with the administration's approval Kennedy traveled to the Soviet Union in 1986 {{to act as a}} go-between in arms control negotiations with reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The discussions were productive, and Kennedy also helped gain the release of a number of Soviet Jewish refuseniks, including Anatoly Shcharansky.|$|E
