2500|$|City then {{embarked}} on a nine-match unbeaten run from early November after the Europa League loss against Lech Poznań to 20 December. The unbeaten run started with two goalless home draws against Manchester United and Birmingham City, in which Mancini was pinpointed in the media for his [...] "defensive" [...] tactics. In response to media criticism, however, {{a good portion of}} Manchester City supporters personally backed Mancini with the chant, [...] "He comes from Italy, to manage Man City, Mancini! Ohhhh! Mancini! Ohhhh!," [...] which has become commonplace (particularly at away matches) in response to what some Manchester City fans saw as an <b>anti-City</b> agenda and an attempt to undermine the club and manager by the national media. The two draws, were interjected by a 2–0 win at West Bromwich Albion and an impressive 4–1 victory at Craven Cottage against Fulham. A last-minute equaliser at the Britannia robbed City of three points against Stoke City but was followed up by a 3–0 win against Red Bull Salzburg which secured City's progression into the knockout phase of the cup. And City racked up another win against Bolton Wanderers, putting them in fourth in the Premier League, and only three points behind league leaders Manchester United. A 3–1 win followed at Upton Park against a struggling West Ham team and a 1–1 draw in Turin against Juventus in the Europa League preserved City's nine-match unbeaten period, and sealed progress to the knockout phase of the Europa League as group winners. During this nine-match period, City had scored 15 goals and had only conceded four goals.|$|E
50|$|On 1 July 2010, Platt {{was hired}} as first team coach at Manchester City {{alongside}} manager (and former teammate) Roberto Mancini, a decision that was not well received by many City fans because of his perceived <b>anti-City</b> stance as a pundit.|$|E
5000|$|Another novelty was The <b>Anti-City</b> Show, which invited {{listeners}} to send letters and reel-to-reel tapes of complaint about the station. It became {{a forum for}} complaints about anything that annoyed. Occasionally, [...] "You've Got Your Troubles" [...] by The Fortunes was broadcast as a signal to land-based associates of a problem, such as a supply shortage.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the original rapid transit plan had failed, political infighting in City Hall stalled any new progress, due to an <b>anti-City</b> Hall campaign led by city manager Murray Seasongood beginning in 1920. Newspapers started to print articles arguing against the subway, using such rationales as the tight curve of the subway and its small tunnels to try to advocate against its completion.|$|E
5000|$|However, a disincorporation effort led by K.T. Magnusson {{threatened}} {{the existence of}} Price's new city. [...] "We Blew It - Now Let's Undo It" [...] said the <b>anti-city</b> literature, and the courts set the disincorporation effort for July 8, only {{a week after the}} new city was supposed to launch. Many thought it prudent for the city to postpone its July 1 start date until the outcome of the disincorporation vote was known. Price vowed to launch West Valley City on July 1 regardless. [...] "Damn the torpedoes," [...] he famously grumbled.|$|E

30|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, the {{continuous}} erosion of the perceptual sphere of individuals through the standardisation of space has shown a resistance to change over time. The contemporary city—extensive and polycentric—gives the illusion {{of living in the}} green and in contact with nature {{but at the same time}} increases the ecological and environmental crisis of the territory. An urban space, in short, which is often described as the <b>anti-city</b> made of solitary buildings and land use (Totaforti 2017).|$|E
40|$|Urban reason, defined under psychoanalytic {{concepts}} transcended {{through the}} use of complex topologies in the generation of urban problems, develops our understanding of the paradoxes of the <b>anti-city</b> within the city, identity and non-identity, and marginalization and inclusion. The city is understood from the rapport of the urban environment, as its urban topology is discovered and its essential configuration subordinated to urbanism, in relation to collective consciousness. This understanding leads to an explanation and comprehension of the phenomena that help to understand identity, marginalization, and violence as urban phenomena...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the times}} of Antiquity, people have looked {{up to the sky}} and {{developed}} various conceptions of Heaven and Hell. Already in the ancient Egypt people developed the tripartite conception of universe with earth placed between the Heaven inhabited by gods above and Hell below. The Old English poetic text of Genesis (MS Junius 11; compilation dated to the 10 th century) presents the earthly paradise, Hell and Middangeard (or the middle earth). Both Genesis A and B that comprise the poem indeed show a single and consistent descriptions of cosmos. The overt consistency may well seem as interesting as the tradition that the poem draws upon as well as distorts. The universe found in the poem is a fusion of the Christian religious learning as well as Germanic tradition. The idea that marries Heaven, earth and Hell in the poetic sequence of OE Genesis is the concept of hall and anti-hall, city and <b>anti-city.</b> The aim of the following paper is to investigate the modes of this presentation of these parts of the universe by the analysis of the clusters of meaning that are associated with hall and city...|$|E
40|$|There are {{spaces in}} Toronto where the city’s grid {{is forced to}} give way. Remnants of {{outdated}} infrastructure, deep geographic indentations, and natural elements appear, disrupting the constraints that govern our urban environment. The spaces remaining have been shaped by industry, re-purposed or abandoned; they are subterranean, and uninhabited, or simply forgotten and absorbed by the growing city. This is an exploration of a found park, six existing terrains in Toronto including; a streetscape, inactive rail path, ravine, river valley and de-industrialized waterfront. Individually, these terrains are often hidden from the urban realm, disorientating and open to interpretation. Connected, they create a green loop around the inner city. This is an exploration recorded in four methods; walking, photography, photomontage and projections. It is a record of my wandering in various terrains and the different lenses that I found and used to understand these spaces. This is a documentation of the existing, {{as well as an}} exploration of a perception of space. It is a record of the temporal experience of passage, of the unfolding of a narrative, and of the unique character of these spaces. The result is a series of curated walks, amplifying the threshold between city and <b>anti-city.</b> I want to reveal the familiar as unfamiliar, and curate the experience of this hidden landscape, and connecting it to our built environment. I had to suppress the urge to fix the spaces, clean them up, connect them, smooth them out. I wanted to approach each of these spaces delicately, hinting at their past, present, and projecting ambitions for future relationships with them. Working with the themes of cultural memory, social dialogue, and geographic history to create new stories, and an evolving backdrop for city life...|$|E
40|$|The Transplanted Bush: Dislocation, Desire and the Domestic {{takes as}} its theme {{the idea of}} the Australian bush and seeks new ways to {{represent}} it within the traditions of Australian figurative landscape painting. The research identifies ways to disrupt the bush brand, a paradigm that has played a significant and romantic role in the construction of Australian national identity, as a rallying point for nationalist sentiment and to sell Australia to the world as a unique tourist destination. The bush, as a space that is <b>anti-city,</b> an idea that generally relies on a British genealogy, and one that is constructed according to hetero-normative strategies, is significant in the creation of Australian identity because it is widely regarded as the real Australia. Real in this context has somehow become distorted to mean those parts of our nation that make us distinct {{from the rest of the}} world, while continuing to reflect the values and aspirations of a dominant culture and its heroic history of colonising and domesticating a strange land. The overriding focus of this investigation has been to determine to what extent it is possible to reconceptualize the bush brand so that it can accommodate new themes of identity, particularly in relation to gender and sexuality. This research adopts the position that the bush is an idea that has relied heavily upon myths, legends and mono-cultural perspectives for its construction and, as a result, is open to negotiation. Consequently, this investigation takes place at the very heart of the bush paradigm, within its grand master narratives, by engaging with its symbols and signifiers. It reviews the ideological and representational role played by the traditional model of Australian figurative landscape painting, and considered how it can be reinvested with new signs, symbols, motifs, colours and ideas. By developing and introducing a new vocabulary of signs and symbols that erodes the distinctions between the bush, the urban and the domestic, this research disrupts the internal logic and coherence of the bush brand...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the appearance of}} the gated communities &# 8722; phenomenon of the contemporary city &# 8722; in the Barra da Tijuca district, located {{in the western part of}} Rio de Janeiro. This district, occupied from its beginning by high income population, was one of the last frontiers in the expansion of the city. The intensifi cation of its occupation started in the 1970 s, after the implementation the Pilot Plan, elaborated in 1968 by architect Lúcio Costa, according to the premises of Modern Urbanism. Urban planning, associated with the action of the real estate market and the increase in the urban violence, resulted in the decline of the urban nucleus established by Costa and {{the appearance of the}} gated communities &# 8722; in the 1980 s &# 8722; as the top real estate product. This model of dwelling, characterized by isolated towers in large stretches of land, with vast green areas and leisure facilities, turned the district into the carioca <b>anti-city.</b> resently, Barra da Tijuca is still one of the main areas of expansion in Rio de Janeiro and is a reference in big private developments focused on the high income population. Esta dissertação trata do surgimento do condomínio residencial fechado &# 8722; fenômeno da cidade contemporânea &# 8722; no bairro Barra da Tijuca, localizado na zona oeste do Rio de Janeiro. O bairro, ocupado desde o início pela população de alta renda, foi uma das últimas fronteiras de expansão da cidade. A intensificação de sua ocupação só ocorreu a partir da década de 1970, após a implementação do Plano Piloto elaborado em 1968 pelo arquiteto Lúcio Costa, conforme premissas do Urbanismo Moderno. O planejamento urbano associado à ação do mercado imobiliário e ao aumento da violência urbana propiciou o declínio do núcleo urbano estabelecido por Costa e o surgimento do condomínio residencial fechado &# 8722; na década de 1980 &# 8722; como o produto moradia a ser explorado. Esse modelo de habitação, pautado na implantação de torres isoladas em grandes glebas, com amplas áreas verdes e de lazer, caracterizou o bairro como a anticidade carioca. Atualmente a Barra da Tijuca se mantêm como uma das principais áreas de expansão do Rio de Janeiro e é um referencial no que diz respeito aos grandes empreendimentos privados voltados para a população de alta renda...|$|E
