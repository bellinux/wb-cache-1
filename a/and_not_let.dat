This near-death experience acted as his catharsis, driving {{him to make the}} most of his talents <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> his abilities go to waste. He joined the Labor Party in 1947 at the age of eighteen, and successfully applied for a Rhodes Scholarship at the end of 1952.|$|E

With well-developed characters and an interesting story, the 1933 Technicolor Silly Symphony cartoon Three Little Pigs became a major box office and pop culture success, with its theme song [...] "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?" [...] becoming a popular chart hit.|$|E

He desired to cement Boone's {{relationship}} with Locke, but was unsure how {{to connect the}} two characters in a meaningful way. The writers chose a vision quest but decided to make this [...] "closed to the audience" [...] <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> them know it was even occurring. Initially, it was conceived that Boone would be convinced into eating Locke's drug, but director Rod Holcomb and the writers thought {{it would have made}} the hallucination easier to guess, and changed it into spreading the concoction into a head injury.|$|E

I should have explained that I didn't suspect them of any desire to launch an attack on us.

Kelly was known [...] "for being a very warm, generous human being". Bassist Bill Crow reported that Kelly was [...] "full of fun": [...] "He was often the center of backstage laughing sessions as we told stories on each other. Wynton had a removable upper front denture. While on stage, if he saw some of us standing in the wings listening, he would turn around so the audience couldn't see, give us a stern look, and drop his upper plate forward onto his lower lip, creating a grotesquely comical effect. Sometimes he heightened it by sticking his tongue out at us over his upper teeth." ...|$|E

[...] Several students of Agassiz who went on to prominence recorded this rite of passage, including Henry Blake, David Starr Jordan, Addison Emery Verrill, and Burt Green Wilder. American literary critic Robert Scholes traces the parable's source to two narratives in particular: those of former students Nathaniel Southgate Shaler and Samuel Hubbard Scudder. Their anecdotes were reprinted in Lane Cooper's Louis Agassiz as a Teacher: Illustrative Extracts on his Method of Instruction. Their separate accounts differ markedly from Pound's: both students provide oral reports with a wealth of detail after being initially forbidden from consulting outside sources.|$|E
500|$|Mockingjay has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. Some {{noted that there}} was a suspense drop between Catching Fire and the start of Mockingjay. Nicole Sperling of Entertainment Weekly gave the book a B+ and said, [...] "Collins has kicked the brutal violence up a notch in an edge-of-your-seat plot". Publishers Weekly gave the book a starred review, calling it [...] "the best yet, a beautifully orchestrated and intelligent novel that succeeds on every level". The review went on to praise the [...] "sharp social commentary and the nifty world building". Kirkus Reviews gave Mockingjay a starred review, saying that the book is exactly what its fans are looking for and that [...] "it will grab them <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> go". Susan Carpenter of the Los Angeles Times compared the battlefield to Iraq and said that the book is every bit as original as the first in the series, ending the review with [...] "Wow".|$|E

They {{were also the}} fourth team to win a World Series without {{trailing}} {{in any of the}} games in the series, and the seventh to win it having previously been three outs away from elimination. With the win, pitcher Lowe became the first pitcher to ever win three series-clinching games in a single postseason having also won Game 3 of the ALDS against the Angels and Game 7 of the ALCS against the Yankees. Although the series was won in St. Louis, 3,000Red Sox fans were present at the game, and many stayed after the final out to celebrate with the team, including going on the field when the team came back out of their dugout with the World Series trophy. Ramírez, who was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the series, said afterwards [...] "I don't believe in curses, I believe you make your own destination.

2500|$|Entwistle's wry and {{sometimes}} dark sense of humour clashed at times with Pete Townshend's more introspective, intellectual work.

She was allowed to undertake Islamic studies, and was known for her ability to memorize the Qur'an {{as well as being}} able to grasp hard to understand points of religious law. Her father was reported to have lamented at {{the fact that she was}} not a son. Táhirih was said to have surpassed her father’s male students which further convinced him of her literary talents.

When Husayn bin Ali met Waleed and Marwan (who was present) in a semi-private meeting at night, he was informed of the late Caliph Muawiyah's passing and Yazid's accession to the caliphate. When asked for his pledge of allegiance to Yazid, Husayn responded that giving his allegiance in private would be insufficient, such a thing should be given in public. Waleed agreed to this, but Marwan interrupted demanding that Waleed imprison Husayn <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> him leave until he gives {{the pledge of allegiance}} to Yazid.
