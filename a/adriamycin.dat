5|$|Doxorubicin is {{commonly}} used to treat some leukemias and Hodgkin's lymphoma, as well as cancers of the bladder, breast, stomach, lung, ovaries, thyroid, soft tissue sarcoma, multiple myeloma, and others. Commonly used doxorubicin-containing regimens are AC (<b>adriamycin,</b> cyclophosphamide), TAC (taxotere, AC), ABVD (<b>Adriamycin,</b> bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine), BEACOPP, CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) and FAC (5-fluorouracil, <b>adriamycin,</b> cyclophosphamide).|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin, {{sold under}} the trade names <b>Adriamycin</b> among others, is a {{chemotherapy}} medication {{used to treat}} cancer.

5|$|Researchers at Farmitalia soon {{discovered}} that changes in biological activity could be made by minor changes {{in the structure of}} the compound. A strain of Streptomyces was mutated using N-nitroso-N-methyl urethane, and this new strain produced a different, red-colored antibiotic. They named this new compound <b>Adriamycin,</b> after the Adriatic Sea, and the name was later changed to doxorubicin to conform to the established naming convention. Doxorubicin showed better activity than daunorubicin against mouse tumors, and especially solid tumors. It also showed a higher therapeutic index, yet the cardiotoxicity remained.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, {{calicheamicin}} {{is able to}} cleave DNA at low concentrations, {{proving to}} be up to 1000 times more effective than <b>adriamycin</b> at combating certain types of tumors.

25|$|Dexamethasone is {{also used}} as a direct {{chemotherapeutic}} agent in certain haematological malignancies, especially {{in the treatment of}} multiple myeloma, in which dexamethasone is given alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, including most commonly with thalidomide (Thal-dex), lenalidomide, bortezomib (Velcade, Vel-dex), or a combination of doxorubicin (<b>Adriamycin)</b> and vincristine or bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{therapy is}} a {{combination}} of limb-salvage orthopedic surgery when possible (or amputation in some cases) and a combination of high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, intra-arterial cisplatin, <b>adriamycin,</b> ifosfamide with mesna, BCD (bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, dactinomycin), etoposide, and muramyl tripeptide. Rotationplasty may be used. Ifosfamide can be used as an adjuvant treatment if the necrosis rate is low.|$|E

50|$|Cardiac toxicity, or cardiomyopathy, {{can be a}} late {{side effect}} of <b>adriamycin.</b> The {{occurrence}} of adriamycin-related cardiac toxicity {{is related to the}} total lifetime dose of <b>adriamycin,</b> and increases sharply in people who receive a cumulative dose of more than 400 mg/m2. Almost all patients treated with ABVD receive less than this dose (for 6 cycles of ABVD, the cumulative <b>adriamycin</b> dose is 300 mg/m2); therefore, adriamycin-related cardiac toxicity is very uncommon with ABVD.|$|E

50|$|Thyroidectomy {{and neck}} {{dissection}} show good results in {{early stages of}} SCTC. However, due to highly aggressive phenotype, surgical treatment is not always possible. The SCTC is a radioiodine-refractory tumor. Radiotherapy might be effective in certain cases, resulting in relatively better survival rate and quality of life. Vincristine, <b>Adriamycin,</b> and bleomycin are used for adjuvant chemotherapy, but their effects are not good enough according to published series.|$|E
