2500|$|A Midrash {{interpreted}} [...] {{to teach}} {{that if the}} Israelites repented {{while they were in}} exile, then God would gather them back together, as [...] says, [...] "And it shall come to pass, when <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> come upon you, the blessing and the curse [...] [...] [...] and [...] shall return [...] [...] [...] and hearken to His voice [...] [...] [...] the Lord your God will bring you into the land [...] [...] [...] and the Lord your God will circumcise your heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{only one}} decent {{way in which a}} civilized man and a civilized woman may {{approach}} one another. Passionate desire is not enough. What is called love is not enough. Pledges, rational considerations, <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> worthless. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> compatible with hate. The primary essential is friendship, clear understanding, absolute confidence. Then within that condition, in that elect relationship, love is permissible, mating, marriage or no marriage, as you will--all things are permissible...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{large portion}} of her mother's money, I should say. When <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> joined together, a father of course feels most anxious as to their disposal." ...|$|E
60|$|My friends, <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> {{written for}} our example. As it was then, so may it be again.|$|R
60|$|Isaiah xxxviii. 16. O Lord, by <b>these</b> <b>things</b> men live, and in <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>is</b> {{the life}} of my spirit.|$|R
25|$|After <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> conducted, {{she would}} be given an ancestral name, and the naming {{ceremony}} or potlatch would occur.|$|R
6000|$|... 'French!' thought Mrs. Decie; 'we shall {{soon have}} peace. Poor Christian! I'm sorry! After <b>all,</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> {{a matter of}} time and opportunity.' This consoled her a good deal.|$|E
6000|$|And it bids us think, as St. Peter bids us: 'When {{therefore}} <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> dissolved, what {{manner of}} persons ought ye {{to be in}} holy conversation and godliness?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is not all}} of it, {{but it is a}} {{large part}} of it. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> {{impregnated}} with life; they are the fruits of an old and complex civilization." ...|$|E
60|$|Ginevra admired my taste, for <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> her adoration; {{she could}} then readily credit {{that they were}} mine too.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{and so had}} the forest, the mountain, {{the human}} race, the world itself. But the origin of <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>is</b> covered with the mists of time." ...|$|R
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> {{attended}} to, and then, {{just as they were}} going out of the house, Sarah came up, her face swollen with crying.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, father. Who can say? <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> a mystery. All I {{do know is}} that I {{have never}} seen a ghost, and I doubt if I ever shall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Marquis,' {{said the}} boy, {{turned to him}} with his eyes opened wide, and his right hand raised, 'in the days when <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> to be {{answered}} for, I summon you and yours, to the last of your bad race, to answer for them. I mark this cross of blood upon you, {{as a sign that}} I do it. In the days when <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> to be answered for, I summon your brother, the worst of the bad race, to answer for them separately. I mark this cross of blood upon him, as a sign that I do it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Deacon Enos, [...] "it {{just shows}} how <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> not worth striving after. We brought nothing into the world, {{and it is}} certain we can carry nothing out." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> against Stanley, and he {{felt that}} if he did not make it quite clear that he was there he would soon not know where he was.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the days}} of the rest of Alfred, [...] When <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> done, [...] And Wessex lay in a patch of peace, [...] Like a dog in a patch of sun-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile, while <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> happening, {{the king}} of that other country had painted out the words his father had written on the walls, and had had these words painted in in their stead: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{did think}} of it," [...] he admitted; [...] "but {{there seemed to}} be no hurry. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> growing into money year by year. Some day I shall send {{everything}} to Christie's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... behold <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> {{written in}} the chronicles of my imagination, and shall be read by thee, my dear friend, and by thy beloved spouse, my other dear friend, at a more {{convenient}} season.|$|E
60|$|Now <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> so {{necessary}} to our salvation, that I know not {{which of them}} can be wanting; neither can any of them be by any means attained but by this blessed Spirit.|$|E
6000|$|The others laughed, and Bromfield Corey remarked thoughtfully, [...] "What astonishes the craven {{civilian}} in <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>is</b> the abundance--the superabundance--of heroism. The cowards {{were the}} exception; {{the men that}} were ready to die, the rule." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They won't {{expect you}} to take any notice of it, surely?" [...] she continued. [...] "When you bought this place, Peter, you gave them {{definitely}} to understand that you had retired into private life, that <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> finished with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> dug {{out from}} heaps of stones and rubbish," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "a few hundred years ago. For nearly a {{thousand}} years before that time, they were regarded as of no more value than so many old bricks.|$|R
6000|$|Because that <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> thus and so, [...] I bid you {{welcome to}} our city. Lo! [...] You're free to come, and free to stay, and free [...] As soon as it shall please you, sirs--to go.|$|E
60|$|<b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> {{received}} Truths here, and {{no doubt}} would be so every where else, if the Eyes of Reason were opened to the Testimony of Nature, or {{if they had the}} helps of these most Incomparable Glasses.|$|E
60|$|But <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> {{secrets of}} which I have perhaps {{no right to}} speak at present. It is {{enough to say that}} Jorsen changed the current of my life on that night when he saved me from death.|$|E
60|$|But while <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> transacting, {{and letters}} and answers passed between Amy and I {{a little slower}} than usual, at which I was not so well pleased as I used to be with Amy's despatch--I say, in this time the {{following}} scene opened.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see that" [...] {{returned}} the radical-hearted Tolly. [...] "Isn't eatin', an' drinkin', an' sleepin', an' walkin', an' runnin', an' talkin', an' thinkin', an' huntin', equally good {{for boys and}} men? If <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>is</b> good for us both, why not smokin'?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They won't {{expect you}} to take any notice of it, surely?" [...] she continued. [...] "When you bought this place, Peter, and left your London offices, you gave them {{definitely}} to understand that you had retired into private life, that <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> finished with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Love {{is the law}} of life," [...] {{broke in}} Leo; [...] "without love there is no life. I seek love that I may live. I believe that <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> ordained to an end which we do not know. Fate draws me on--I fulfil my fate----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no! if {{you don't}} mind my {{going on with}} my work; for I can't leave it very well. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> to be sent away to-morrow, that's why the place is in such confusion," [...] replied the girl, as she fell to {{polishing}} up a brass snuffer-tray.|$|E
60|$|And {{as every}} {{man-of-war}} is furnished with a signal-book, where <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> set down in order, therefore, though two American frigates--almost perfect strangers to each other--came {{from the opposite}} Poles, yet {{at a distance of}} more than a mile they could carry on a very liberal conversation in the air.|$|E
60|$|Hezekiah felt it, too, {{good man}} as he was, when he was sick, and like to die. And {{it was not for}} many a day that he found out the truth about these dark hours of misery, that by <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> men live, and in <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>is</b> the life of the Spirit.|$|R
60|$|So after <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> done, {{five other}} esquires {{appeared}} to conduct Sir Lamorack {{away from that}} place. These led him through several passages and hallways until at last {{they came to a}} great space of hall wherein stood a single man; and that man was Sir Tristram.|$|R
60|$|The {{result of}} <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>was</b> that Tom Brixton settled {{down near the}} village where his mother dwelt, and Fred Westly, after staying long enough among the Sawback Mountains to dig out of them a sufficiency, {{returned}} home and bought a small farm beside his old chum.|$|R
