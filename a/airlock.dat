5|$|As she {{prepares for}} stasis, Ripley finds the alien has stowed-away aboard the shuttle. She {{puts on a}} {{spacesuit}} and opens the shuttle's <b>airlock.</b> The explosive decompression forces the alien into the <b>airlock</b> doorway. She shoots it with a grappling hook to propel it into space, but the gun catches as the <b>airlock</b> closes, tethering the alien to the shuttle. It attempts to crawl {{into one of the}} engines but Ripley fires them to blast the alien into space. After recording the voyage final log entry, she places herself and the cat into stasis for the trip home to Earth.|$|E
5|$|After a 40-day delay {{caused by}} faulty {{computer}} chips, Kvant-2 was launched on 26 November 1989. After problems deploying the craft's solar array {{and with the}} automated docking systems on both Kvant-2 and Mir, the new module was docked manually on 6 December. Kvant-2 added {{a second set of}} gyrodines to Mir, and brought the new life support systems for recycling water and generating oxygen, reducing dependence on ground resupply. The module featured a large <b>airlock</b> with a one-metre hatch. A special backpack unit (known as Ikar), an equivalent of the US Manned Maneuvering Unit, was located inside Kvant-2's <b>airlock.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Star Trek, Star Wars {{and some}} other genres of fiction, {{conventional}} <b>airlocks</b> may be replaced by forcefields which hold in air while allowing solid matter like spacecraft to pass through. <b>Airlocks</b> of this type usually have pressure doors as a backup.|$|R
50|$|The North Pole {{contains}} Rama's <b>airlocks,</b> and {{is where}} the Endeavour lands. The <b>airlocks</b> open into {{the hub of the}} massive bowl shaped cap at the North Pole, with three 8-kilometre long stair systems, called Alpha, Beta, and Gamma by the crew, leading to the plain.|$|R

5|$|The initial spacewalk {{to begin}} the {{assembly}} of the International Space Station was held on December 7, 1998, following {{the launch of the}} first section of the station, Zarya, from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, on November 20, 1998. The spacewalk attached the U.S.-built Unity node to Zarya. The longest spacewalk was performed on March 11, 2001, when STS-102 crew members Susan J. Helms and James S. Voss conducted a full spacewalk, and then returned to the <b>airlock,</b> but remained in their suits ready to exit the <b>airlock</b> again in case the robotics operations ran into problems. The total time for that spacewalk was eight hours and fifty-six minutes.|$|E
5|$|On 20 {{missions}} (1983–98) the Space Shuttle carried Spacelab, {{designed in}} cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA). Spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight, but remained in the Shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an <b>airlock.</b> Another famous series of missions were the launch and later successful repair of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and 1993, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The realistic-looking {{effects of}} the astronauts {{floating}} weightless in space and inside the spacecraft were accomplished by suspending the actors from wires attached {{to the top of}} the set, and placing the camera underneath them. The actors' bodies blocked the camera's view of the suspension wires, creating a very believable appearance of floating. For the shot of Poole floating into the pod's arms during Bowman's rescue attempt, a stuntman replaced a dummy on the wire to realistically portray the movements of an unconscious human, and was shot in slow motion to enhance the illusion of drifting through space. The scene showing Bowman entering the emergency <b>airlock</b> from the E.V.A. pod was done in a similar way: an off-camera stagehand, standing on a platform, held the wire suspending Dullea above the camera positioned at the bottom of the vertically configured <b>airlock.</b> At the proper moment, the stagehand first loosened his grip on the wire, causing Dullea to fall toward the camera, then, while holding the wire firmly, he jumped off the platform, causing Dullea to ascend back up toward the hatch.|$|E

5|$|A mentally {{unbalanced}} Ricky Williams (David Baxt) {{is driven}} to re-enter the caves when {{a sample of}} crystals pulsates and the chemical intelligence exerts its influence through a mark on his arm. Thrown into a grille in a compromised environmental suit, Gail (Rosalind Lloyd) removes her helmet and freezes {{to death in the}} toxic atmosphere while trying to amputate her trapped foot with a chainsaw. Documentation officer Kate Frost (Stephanie Beacham) shoots Ricky with a harpoon gun before he opens both the inner and outer <b>airlock</b> doors and renders the air inside the base unbreathable.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Koblenz Dallas (Tom Skerritt) is {{the captain}} of the Nostromo and the only human crew member with access to Mother, the onboard computer. When he {{receives}} a distress signal from the Derelict, an Engineer ship, Dallas steers the Nostromo off course to investigate the beacon. After the Alien hatches from Gilbert Kane's chest and murders Samuel Brett, Dallas enters the ship's air ducts to lure it to the <b>airlock</b> and eject it into space. He is attacked by the Alien and disappears – presumed dead – leaving only his flamethrower.|$|E
5|$|Brett {{follows the}} crew's cat, Jones, into an engine {{room and the}} now fully-grown alien (Bolaji Badejo) attacks him and disappears with his body into an air shaft. After heated discussion, the crew decide the {{creature}} {{must be in the}} air ducts. Dallas enters the ducts, intending to force the alien into the <b>airlock,</b> but it ambushes him. Lambert implores the others to abandon ship and escape in its small shuttle. Now in command, Ripley explains that the shuttle will not support four people and pushes to continue with Dallas' plan of flushing out the alien.|$|E

5|$|Henderson and JPL {{director}} Bruce Ng {{prepare a}} space probe to deliver {{enough food to}} last Watney until Ares IV's arrival. When the Hab's <b>airlock</b> malfunctions due to a small puncture, it destroys Watney's crops. Sanders orders the team {{to speed up the}} supply mission with the Iris probe by skipping the safety inspections. However, an oversight causes the destabilization and subsequent explosion of the rocket 40 seconds after liftoff, causing Watney to think about his seemingly inevitable death.|$|E
5|$|Nine years later, {{the four}} are {{once more the}} only beings on the ship. Rimmer is again a hologram, Holly is offline, and Lister is {{mourning}} Kochanski, lost to him out of an <b>airlock</b> some time previously. A chance {{to get back to}} Earth through a dimension warp presents itself; although it is not quite what it appears to be, it gives Lister new hope when he learns that Kochanski is still alive after all.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{enters the}} space station via an <b>airlock.</b> She cannot re-establish {{communication}} with Kowalski and concludes that she is now the sole survivor. Inside the station, a fire breaks out, forcing her to rush to the Soyuz. As she maneuvers the capsule away from the ISS, the tangled parachute tethers prevent it from separating from the station. Stone performs a spacewalk in order to release the cables, succeeding just as the debris field completes its orbit and destroys the station. Stone aligns the Soyuz with Tiangong, but discovers that Soyuz's engine has no fuel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Airlocks</b> have a {{very similar}} {{structure}} to mantraps but are used for the opposite purpose, allowing free ingress and egress (while also restricting airflow).|$|R
25|$|Staff {{enter and}} leave through <b>airlocks</b> (sometimes {{including}} an air shower stage), and wear protective clothing such as hoods, face masks, gloves, boots, and coveralls.|$|R

5|$|There {{were also}} {{proposals}} {{to use the}} Gemini spacecraft to conduct long-duration missions to small, purpose-built space stations in low-Earth orbit. One proposal saw a space station based on the Agena, {{which would have been}} used to provide propulsion and attitude control for the station. A pressurized module between the Agena and the docking adapter would have been used by the crew for accommodation and to conduct experiments. The crew would have boarded the Agena by means of an inflatable tunnel between the hatches and its <b>airlock.</b> The Pecan spacecraft was a similar proposal.|$|E
5|$|To enable spacewalks, Salyut 6 was {{equipped}} with an inward-opening EVA hatch {{on the side of}} the forward transfer compartment, which could be used as an <b>airlock</b> in a similar way to the system used on Salyut 4. This compartment contained two new semi-rigid spacesuits which allowed much greater flexibility than earlier suits, and could be donned within five minutes in case of an emergency. Finally, the station offered considerable improvements in living conditions over previous outposts, with machinery being soundproofed, the crews being provided with designated 'cots' for sleeping and the equipping of the station with a shower and extensive gymnasium.|$|E
5|$|As of May 12, 2017, {{there have}} been 200 spacewalks devoted to {{assembly}} and maintenance of the International Space Station totaling 1247 hours and 55 minutes. As of March 2, 2011, a total time of 973 hours and fifty-three minutes has been spent in extra-vehicular activity (EVA), with 127 of these EVAs performed from station airlocks, totaling 787 hours and twenty-eight minutes in spacewalk time from the station itself. Twenty-eight spacewalks have been performed from a shuttle, ninety-three from the Quest Joint <b>Airlock,</b> thirty-two from the Pirs docking compartment, and two from the transfer compartment at the forward end of the Zvezda Service Module.|$|E
50|$|More modern {{warships}} use semi-automated or automated ammunition hoists. The {{path through}} which the naval artillery's ammunition passed typically has blast-resistant <b>airlocks</b> and other safety devices, including provisions to flood the compartment with seawater in an emergency.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Airlocks</b> are {{commonly}} used in science fiction {{as a form of}} execution, often referred to as [...] "spacing" [...] or [...] "airlocking". Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5, and the Honorverse books both make frequent use or reference to it.|$|R

5|$|Due to {{the strain}} on the oxygen supplies, the crew decides to abandon most of the {{equipment}} and to cut short the lunar stay. The repair work is completed slightly ahead of schedule, and the rocket cleared for lift-off. Halfway to Earth, Jorgen escapes his bonds thanks to the detectives' bungling and tries to kill Tintin and the others; Wolff seeks to prevent him, and in their struggle over a gun Jorgen is killed. When it is revealed that {{there will not be}} enough oxygen aboard for the crew to survive the journey, Wolff sacrifices himself by opening the <b>airlock</b> and floating out into space to his death. The crew fall unconscious but Tintin wakes long enough to set the rocket to auto-pilot and it arrives back in Syldavia safely.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{are able}} to track the Osaarian vessel, finding a large 1,000-year-old sphere {{constructed}} out of a single alloy. Archer and his away team discover a series of habitat modules containing most of the stolen items. The crew also finds a cargo manifest, and Ensign Sato soon learns they had also recently attacked a Xindi ship. Archer once again confronts Orgoth, demanding {{to know everything about}} the Xindi. He then drags the Osaarian to an <b>airlock,</b> initiating the decompression cycle. Orgoth soon relents, revealing they downloaded the Xindi database, while providing the access codes to their computer. When the alien ship returns, Mayweather maneuvers Enterprise close enough for Sato to download the bulk of it. Archer sends Orgoth back to his people.|$|E
5|$|Alien: Isolation was {{released}} on 7 October 2014, featuring two pre-order downloadable content missions that allow players to play two scenes from the original film. The first mission, entitled Crew Expendable, features the original crew of the Nostromo and involves the player controlling Ripley, Dallas or Parker attempting to flush the alien creature from the air vents and into the ship's <b>airlock.</b> The second mission, Last Survivor, is set during the film's finale and involves the player controlling Ripley {{as she tries to}} activate the Nostromos self-destruct sequence and reach the escape shuttle. Unlike the first mission, the second mission is only available for players who pre-ordered the game at certain retailers. Upon release, five additional downloadable content packs for the game were periodically released between October 2014 and March 2015. These packs expand the game's Survivor Mode with new characters, challenges, maps, and other features. A collection featuring the game and all the downloadable content packs {{was released}} for Linux, OS X, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in late 2015.|$|E
50|$|Also on {{the lower}} deck of the FMARS and MDRS are the <b>airlocks</b> and the Extra-vehicular Activity {{preparation}} room (EVA prep room). This is where crew members don and doff their simulated Mars spacesuits prior to leaving the Habitat Unit.|$|R
50|$|On {{a number}} of special {{occasions}} since 1993, crossings have been made directly using the bidirectional Channel Tunnel service tunnel, positioned between the two rail tunnel bores. This central service tunnel has <b>airlocks</b> at both ends, and a concrete screed road surface.|$|R
50|$|An air-supported (or air-inflated) {{structure}} is any building that derives its structural integrity {{from the use}} of internal pressurized air to inflate a pliable material (i.e. structural fabric) envelope, so that air is the main support of the structure, and where access is via <b>airlocks.</b>|$|R
