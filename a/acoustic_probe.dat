40|$|One of the {{important}} Canadian Wood Fibre Centre’s mandates is to develop methods to facilitate {{the flow of information}} on the wood quality and quantity along the chain of forest values. Among its research projects, one entitled Enhanced Forest Inventory aims to produce tools to map the wood attributes in terms of physico-mechanical properties by using prediction models based on the attributes of the forest tree and stand. The main inputs of these models come from non-destructive measurements on standing trees (<b>acoustic</b> <b>probe,</b> resistograph, terrestrial lidar) and from spatial data (aerial lidar). Among the obtained results, the correlations are significant between acoustic velocity, drill resistance, tree and stand attributes.

40|$|The {{principle}} {{objective of}} the project was to develop an <b>acoustic</b> <b>probe</b> for determining the weight fraction of particles in a flowing suspension. The suspension can be solid-liquid (S-L) or solid-gas-liquid (S-G-L). The work accomplished during {{the first three years of}} DOE funding was devoted to the development of a rigorous theory for acoustic wave propagation through solid-liquid (S-L) and solid-gas-liquid (S-G-L). In the first funding period we developed an <b>acoustic</b> <b>probe</b> for S-G-L suspensions that has resulted in a theory, supported by our experiments, to describe small amplitude acoustic wave propagations in dilute suspensions (Norato, 1999; Spelter al., 1999, 2001 : Norato et al. 2002). The theory agrees well with experimental data of sound attenuation over a wide range of particle sizes, frequencies, and weight percent solids. We have also completed theoretical and experimental investigation on the effect of entrained gas bubbles on the attenuation. This analysis permits us to determine the S-L weight percent in the presence of bubbles...|$|E

Electrical {{stimulation of}} the cochlea may excite residual inner hair cells, either by direct electrical stimulation or through a mechanical event. Hair cell mediated responses of the auditory nerve to electrical stimulation were estimated from forward masking of the compound action potential evoked by an <b>acoustic</b> <b>probe.</b> Masking by a fixed electrical masker peaked for probes equal in frequency to the pulse repetition rate and its second harmonic, suggesting a spatially tuned profile of excitation within the cochlea. Furthermore, the tuning curves for masking of a fixed <b>acoustic</b> <b>probe</b> peaked for masker pulse rates close to {{the frequency of the}} probe. A secondary peak of masking was commonly seen for electrical stimulation at one half of the probe frequency, suggesting masking of the probe by the second harmonic of the electrical stimulus.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the research project during the first funding period was to develop an <b>acoustic</b> <b>probe</b> to measure volume percent solids in solid-liquid slurries {{in the presence of}} small amounts of gas bubbles. This problem was addressed because of the great need for a non-invasive, accurate and reliable method for solids monitoring in liquid slurries in the presence of radiolytically generated gases throughout the DOE complex. These measurements are necessary during mobilization of salts and sediments in tanks, transport of these slurries in transfer lines to processing facilities across a site, and, in some instances, during high level waste processing. Although acoustic probes have been commonly used for monitoring flows in single-phase fluids (McLeod, 1967), their application to monitor two-phase mixtures has not yet fully realized its potential. A number of investigators in recent years have therefore been involved in developing probes for measuring the volume fractions in liquid solid suspensions (Atkinson and Kytomaa, 1993; Greenwood et al., 1993; Martin et al., 1995) and in liquid-liquid suspensions (Bonnet and Tavlarides, 1987; Tavlarides and Bonnet, 1988, Yi and Tavlarides, 1990; Tsouris and Tavlarides, 1993, Tsouris et al., 1995). In particular, Atkinson and Kytomaa (1993) showed that the acoustic technique can be used to determine both the velocity and the volume fraction of solids while Martin et al. (1995) and Spelt et al. (1999) showed that the <b>acoustic</b> <b>probe</b> {{can also be used to}} obtain information on the size distribution of the particles. In a recent testing of in-line slurry monitors with radioactive slurries suspended with Pulsair Mixers (Hylton & Bayne, 1999), an <b>acoustic</b> <b>probe</b> did not compare well with other instruments most probably due to presence of entrained gases and improper acoustic frequency range of interrogation. The work of the investigators cited has established the potential of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>probe</b> for characterizing/monitoring two-phase flows in relatively ideal, well-characterized suspensions. Two major factors which we judge has prevented its wide-spread use in the processing industry, particularly for dilute suspensions, is careful selection of the frequency range for interrogation and quantification and removal of the noise introduced by bubbles from the acoustic signal obtained from the suspension. Our research during the first funding period to develop an <b>acoustic</b> <b>probe</b> for solid-gas liquid suspensions has resulted in a theory, supported by our experiments, to describe small amplitude dilute suspensions (Norato, 1999, Spelt et al., 1999, Spelt et al., 2001). The theory agrees well with experimental data of sound attenuation up to 45 {approx} 01 % suspensions of 0. 11 and 77 micron radius polystyrene particles in water and 0. 4 to 40 vol %, suspensions of 32 micron soda-lime glass particles in water. Also, analyses of our attenuation experiments for solid-gas liquid experiments suggest the theory can be applied to correct for signal interference due to the presence of bubbles over a selected frequency range to permit determination of the solid-liquid volume fraction. Further, we show experimentally that a reliable linear dependency of weight percent solids with attenuation is obtained for low weight fractions at high frequencies of interrogation where bubble interference is minimal. There was a collaborative effort during the first funding period with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratories in that Dr. Margaret Greenwood was a co-investigator on the project. Dr. Greenwood provided a high level of experimental knowledge and techniques on ultrasound propagation, measurement and data processing.

In faulty conditions, the intake mass flow sensed by the {{mass flow sensor}} does not reach the combustion chamber, resulting in a less than required air fuel mass ratio. This may result in increased emissions along with unsatisfactory performance of exhaust gas recirculation system. In the present work, an acoustic sniffer system has been developed which identifies the presence and location of leaks in the intake system. The acoustic sniffer system uses a directional <b>acoustic</b> <b>probe</b> which records acoustic signatures of the leaks and positively identifies their presence.

40|$|A Micro-opto-mechanical systems (MOMS) based {{technology}} for the fabrication of ultrasonic probes on optical fiber is presented. Thanks to the high miniaturization level reached, the realization of an ultrasonic system constituted by ultrasonic generating and detecting elements, suitable for minimally invasive applications or Non Destructive Evaluation (NDE) of materials at high resolution, is demonstrated. The ultrasonic generation is realized by irradiating a highly absorbing carbon film patterned on silicon micromachined structures with a nanosecond pulsed laser source, generating a mechanical shock wave due to the thermal expansion of the film induced by optical energy conversion into heat. The short duration of the pulsed laser, together with an appropriate emitter design, assure high frequency and wide band ultrasonic generation. The acoustic detection is also realized on a MOMS device using an interferometric receiver, fabricated with a Fabry-Perot optical cavity realized {{by means of a}} patterned SU- 8 and two Al metallization levels. In order to detect the ultrasonic waves, the cavity is interrogated by a laser beam measuring the reflected power with a photodiode.

Both pulse rate and pulse width influenced the degree of masking. The vibration of a region of the basilar membrane was estimated by recording the local cochlear microphonic evoked by biphasic pulses. The amplitude of the cochlear microphonic was proportional to the amplitude of the spectral component of the electrical stimulus to which the local cochlear microphonic was tuned.

Psychol. 84, 98 - 103) reported elevated skin conductance responses (SCR), subjective fear, and a paradoxical lack of startle potentiation during aversive respiratory stimulation with an inspiratory resistive load (IRL). This study aimed to replicate these findings and to explore whether the lack of startle potentiation during an aversive IRL is related to attentional allocation to the IRL. Reaction times to the acoustic startle probe served as an indirect index of attentional focus on the respiratory stimulus. The earlier findings on SCR and subjective fear were replicated. However, startle potentiation occurred for the aversive IRL with a 1500 ms lead interval, and reaction times to the <b>acoustic</b> <b>probe</b> were not slower for the aversive IRL compared to other types of lead stimuli. This suggests that startle potentiation during aversive respiratory stimulation with IRLs only occurs when an exteroceptive task limits attentional allocation to the interoceptive experience. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Manganese crusts are {{the focus}} of much {{attention}} as a potential mineral resource. The crusts form a thin layer of deposit that is distributed over wide areas on the surface of seamounts. To date, the only way to know the thickness of manganese crusts has been through sampling and drilling, but these methods are expensive and time consuming. We have developed an acoustic device that can determine the thickness of manganese crusts during surveys using an underwater robot. This system has worked successfully during sea trials on the flat top of Takuyo-Daigo seamount, located in the northwest Pacific. However, manganese crusts are known to be distributed not only on flat surfaces but also on the slopes of seamounts, and while accurate measurements are possible on relatively flat areas of the seafloor, the quality of measurements made on steep slopes are degraded by the large angle of incidence of the necessarily narrow beam of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>probe.</b> The aim of this research is to investigate potential methods to improve data return rates of manganese crust thickness measurements on steep slopes. The effects of the angle of incidence on the acoustic reflections measured from a manganese crust sample are determined experimentally and it is found that an angle of incidence larger than 3 ° has a detrimental effect on the measured reflected signal. High resolution 3 D bathymetry data acquired using the 3 D visual mapping device `SeaXerocks' was analyzed, so as to determine the actual local inclination of crust covered seafloor. Based on the analysis, it is suggested that a double gimbal system should be introduced to actively control the angle of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>probe</b> so that the acoustic beam enters the seafloor orthogonally. In order to achieve real-time control, a method to determine the relative angle based on sparse measurements of the seafloor is necessary.

The performance of the developed double gimbal system has been assessed in water tank experiments working on simple sloped models of known geometry.

Validity of the numerical code has been checked by comparison calculated flowfield data with the obtained experimental results. It has been confirmed particularly that the CFD code applied correctly reproduces the flow features. Keywords—Acoustic probes, detached eddy simulation (DES), laser-Doppler anemometry (LDA), precessing vortex core (PVC). I...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} of {{measuring}} acoustic intensity automatically is presented. The method uses measur-ments of the cross spectrum of the pressures at two closely spaced microphones. The <b>acoustic</b> intensity <b>probe</b> used is composed of two microphones which are arranged in parallel and with a short distance slided along those axes, and combined symmetrically {{with respect to a}} holder axis. The holder can be turned around its axis by steps of a constant angle for measuring three directional components of an acoustic intensity vector. The acoustic intensity at a field point can be automatically measured by using such composed microphones. A transfer function technique is used for approximately correcting the phase-mismatch error between the instru-mentation of the signal channels of two microphones. This method of measuring acoustic intensity automatical-ly is actually applied to a visualization technque of the flow pattern of sound energy emitted from one aperture of an enclosure with a speaker inside. The experimental results show that the <b>acoustic</b> intensity <b>probe</b> used is an appropriate sensor for the auto-matic measuremend of spatial acoustic intensity vectors...|$|R
