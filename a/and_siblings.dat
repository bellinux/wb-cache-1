5|$|Anna Anderson (16 December 1896– 12 February 1984) was {{the best}} known of several impostors who claimed to be Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia. Anastasia, the {{youngest}} daughter of the last Tsar and Tsarina of Russia, Nicholas II and Alexandra, was killed along with her parents <b>and</b> <b>siblings</b> on 17 July 1918 by communist revolutionaries in Yekaterinburg, Russia; but the location of her body was unknown until 2007.|$|E
5|$|Each person {{belongs to}} both the mother's and the father's families, the only {{bilateral}} family line in Indonesia. Children, therefore, inherit household affiliation from both mother and father, including land and even family debts. Children's names are given {{on the basis of}} kinship, and are usually chosen after dead relatives. Names of aunts, uncles and cousins are commonly referred to in the names of mothers, fathers <b>and</b> <b>siblings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Family members {{contribute}} to pragmatic development in different ways. Fathers often act as secondary caregivers, and may know the child less intimately. Older siblings may lack {{the capacity to}} acknowledge the child's needs. As a result, both fathers <b>and</b> <b>siblings</b> may pressure children to communicate more clearly. They often challenge children to improve their communication skills, therefore preparing them to communicate with strangers about unfamiliar topics. Fathers have more breakdowns when communicating with infants, and spend less time focused on the same objects or actions as infants. Siblings are more directive and less responsive to infants, which motivates infants to participate in conversations with their older siblings. There are limitations to studies {{that focus on the}} influences of fathers <b>and</b> <b>siblings,</b> as most research is descriptive and correlational. In reality, there are many variations of family configurations, and context influences parent behaviour more than parent gender does. The majority of research in this field is conducted with mother/child pairs.|$|E

5|$|Alder {{left for}} Paul's house, with Moore, in November 1805. He and Moore arrived in Virginia the Sunday after New Year, and Alder was {{reunited with his}} {{biological}} mother <b>and</b> <b>siblings.</b> Alder stayed {{with his family in}} Virginia for over a year, and while visiting his family he met {{and fell in love with}} Mary Ann Blont, a woman from Virginia. The couple were married on January 6, 1806, and in August 1806, Alder, Blont, and the rest of Alder's family returned to Pleasant Valley. Alder built another log cabin along the Big Darby Creek in 1806, and he and Mary had 12 children between 1808 and 1830.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, Thomas {{developed}} {{an interest in}} archaeology, entomology, and ornithology, as well as drawing. In 1913 his family made plans for him to join the Royal Navy, although he failed the entrance exam due to alleged poor eyesight. At {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, Lethbridge was sent to Wellington College in Berkshire, while his mother <b>and</b> <b>siblings</b> moved to Buckhurst in Wokingham, Berkshire. In February 1919 Violet and her children moved to Manor House in Finchampstead, where Jacintha and Bill became seriously ill {{as a result of a}} flu pandemic; the former survived but Bill died in March.|$|E
5|$|Born in Forbes, New South Wales, on 27February 1903, Lester Brain was {{the second}} son of an English mining {{engineer}} and manager, Austin Brain, and his Australian wife, Katie. Originally from Gloucestershire, Austin had emigrated with his parents <b>and</b> <b>siblings</b> in 1885, prospecting for gold in the United States before settling in Australia. By the age of thirteen, Lester owned his own motorcycle bought secondhand for £11; its poor condition and constant need for repair helped him become mechanically adept at an early age. He completed his education at Sydney Grammar School, where he excelled in maths, before being employed by the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney (CBC) in 1919.|$|E

5|$|Finkelstein {{has written}} of his Jewish parents' {{experiences}} during World War II. His mother, Maryla Husyt, {{grew up in}} Warsaw, survived the Warsaw Ghetto, the Majdanek concentration camp, and two slave labor camps. Her first husband died in the war. She considered {{the day of her}} liberation as the most horrible day of her life, as she realized that she was alone, her parents <b>and</b> <b>siblings</b> gone. Norman's father, Zacharias Finkelstein, active in Hashomer Hatzair, was a survivor of both the Warsaw Ghetto and the Auschwitz concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|In May or June 1820, Anna Cooke, an {{unmarried}} planter's daughter {{in her early}} 30s, claimed that Sharp {{was the father of}} her illegitimate child; Sharp denied her claim. The stillborn child was rumored to have dark skin, and some speculated that it was a mulatto, with a black father. After her father's death and the sale of their plantation in Fairfax County, Virginia, Cooke had moved with her mother <b>and</b> <b>siblings</b> to Warren County between 1805 and 1810, when she may have met Sharp. In addition to losing the child, Cooke suffered the deaths of three of her five brothers between 1818 and 1821.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Wilson’s disease (WD) is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder {{characterized by the}} functional disruption of adenosine triphosphatase 7 B (ATP 7 B), which results in positive copper balance. Although the primary manifestations of the disease are hepatic or neurological in scope, the factors that cause a very diverse picture ofWD are not well researched. We compared the first clinical presentation, ages of onset and diagnosis, copper metabolism parameters, and ceruloplasmin levels between in-dex cases (ICs) <b>and</b> their <b>siblings.</b> We examined 73 ICs <b>and</b> 95 <b>siblings</b> from 73 families, including a total of 168 patients with biochemical and genetically confirmed WD diagnoses. We observed an 86 % concordance rate of primary clinical symp-toms among ICs with hepatic symptoms <b>and</b> their <b>siblings.</b> There was 66 % concordance among ICs with neurological symptoms <b>and</b> their <b>siblings.</b> No differences regarding age at onset of symptoms or copper metabolism parameters at diagno-sis were identified between hepatic ICs <b>and</b> their <b>siblings.</b> The age at symptom onset did not differ between neurological ICs <b>and</b> their <b>siblings,</b> although ICs presented lower ceruloplasmin and serum copper levels. These results demonstrate a high intra-familial concordance of the clinical and biochemical presenta-tion of WD, suggesting that similar factors shared within the same families strongly influence the disease presentation...|$|R
5|$|In this episode, Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) {{stops the}} funeral of Nikki Parkson (Mary Fegreus) after seeing {{irregularities}} in her death. Nikki's mother Lillian (Jill Eikenberry), <b>and</b> <b>siblings</b> Sara (Jo Armeniox) and Bill (Eric Sheffer Stevens), all say that Nikki was suicidal, with evidence at the scene suggesting this, but when Megan and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) do an autopsy, the evidence suggests otherwise. Meanwhile, Megan finds out from daughter Lacey (Mary Mouser) that her ex-husband Todd (Jeffrey Nordling) is {{in a relationship with}} her boss Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan).|$|E
5|$|Judy was a {{pure-bred}} {{liver and}} white Pointer. She {{was born in}} February 1936 in the Shanghai Dog Kennels, a boarding kennel used by English expatriates in Shanghai, China. Judy was one of seven puppies to a dog named Kelly owned by a couple from Sussex. At {{the age of three}} months, she escaped and had been kept in a back alley by a shopkeeper until she was six months old. Following an altercation with some sailors from a Japanese Navy gunboat, she was found by a worker from the kennel and returned there. She was originally called Shudi, which was anglicised to become Judy. By the time she returned to the kennel, her mother <b>and</b> <b>siblings</b> were no longer there.|$|E
5|$|Princesses and princes of the United Kingdom are {{provided}} with distinctive forms of coronet, which they don during the service. A male heir-apparent's coronet displays four crosses-pattée alternating with four fleurs-de-lis, surmounted by an arch. The same style, without the arch, is used by other children <b>and</b> <b>siblings</b> of the monarch. The coronets of children of the heir-apparent display four fleurs-de-lis, two crosses-pattée and two strawberry leaves. A fourth style, including four crosses-pattée and four strawberry leaves, {{is used for the}} children of the sons and brothers of sovereigns. The aforementioned coronets are borne in place of those to which they might otherwise be entitled as peers or peeresses.|$|E

5|$|Terence Aubrey Murray {{was born}} in Ireland in 1810 and came to Sydney with his father, a retired redcoat army officer, <b>and</b> <b>siblings</b> in 1827. In 1837, he {{acquired}} the Yarralumla sheep station, taking up residence in Yarralumla's Georgian-style homestead, which he extended. He was elected unopposed to represent the surrounding Counties of Murray, King and Georgiana in the first partially elective Legislative Council in 1843. With the establishment of responsible government in 1856, Murray {{became a member of}} the first Legislative Assembly, representing the electorate of Southern Boroughs – which included nearby Queanbeyan – and in 1859 he was elected to represent Argyle – which included another of his pastoral properties, Winderradeen, in the Collector area, north of Canberra.|$|E
5|$|Terns {{have a wide}} {{repertoire}} of vocalisations. For example, the common tern has a distinctive alarm, kee-yah, also used {{as a warning to}} intruders, and a shorter kyar, given as an individual takes flight in response to a more serious threat; this quietens the usually noisy colony while its residents assess the danger. Other calls include a down-slurred keeur given when an adult is approaching the nest with a fish, and a kip uttered during social contact. Parents and chicks can locate one another by call, <b>and</b> <b>siblings</b> also recognise each other's vocalisations from about the twelfth day after hatching, which helps to keep the brood together.|$|E
5|$|An {{earthquake}} and subsequent volcanic eruption separates Orion {{from his parents}} <b>and</b> <b>siblings.</b> Joe locates Orion and manages to rescue him, disappearing himself in the process, while Ōu soldier Sasuke gets separated from Rigel and others. With the Ōu Mountains in complete disarray, new threats arrive to exploit its weaknesses. Three sons of the Irish Wolfhound Kamakiri, a platoon leader for Hōgen, wish to avenge their father's death. Kurohabaki Masamune, {{the leader of the}} Kurohabaki Clan of ninja dogs, aims to take over Ōu and strengthen his army. He is the adoptive son of the former Kurohabaki leader, Terumune, and was previously denied leadership of the clan, despite his striving for approval. Instead, Terumune decided that his blood-related son Yamabiko, born after Masamune's arrival, would become leader. Thereafter, Masamune banished Terumune and took control of the clan. He holds a grudge against Yamabiko and plans to find and kill him. Meanwhile, members of the Kurohabaki clan roam Ōu, gathering recruits and killing those who resist.|$|E

5|$|Born in Stettin, Germany (now Szczecin, Poland), to assimilated Jews, Döblin {{moved with}} his mother <b>and</b> <b>siblings</b> to Berlin when he {{was ten years old}} after his father had {{abandoned}} them. Döblin would live in Berlin for the almost all of the next forty-five years, engaging with such key figures of the prewar and Weimar-era German cultural scene as Herwarth Walden and the circle of Expressionists, Bertolt Brecht, and Thomas Mann. Only a few years after his rise to literary celebrity with the 1929 publication of Berlin Alexanderplatz, Döblin was forced into exile by the rise of the Nazi dictatorship. He spent 1933–1940 in France and then was forced to flee again {{at the start of the}} Second World War. Like many other German émigrés he spent the war years in Los Angeles, where he converted to Catholicism. He moved to West Germany after the war but did not feel at home in postwar Germany's conservative cultural climate and returned to France. His final years were marked by poor health and financial difficulties, and his literary work was met with relative neglect.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{defeated}} Betterman 2 to 0 at {{the finals}} of the 2012 U.S. Olympic Trials. Coleman had attended Betterman's wrestling clinics {{when he was}} younger. Coleman is {{the youngest member of}} the American wrestling delegation going to the Olympics. After Coleman qualified for the Olympics, he realized that his mother, who works in customer service for the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority, could not afford to attend due to financial hardship. Coleman was living at the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs on a limited monthly stipend from the United States Olympic Committee and could not assist her. Powell rented Coleman's family a one-bedroom flat in London out of personal funds and the Oak Park High School wrestling program subsequently raised $14,000 to ensure that his mother, aunt <b>and</b> <b>siblings</b> could attend. Coleman dropped from the 66kg division to the 60kg division for the Olympics. Coleman lost {{in the first round of}} Olympic competition to Ivo Angelov of Bulgaria by a 31 score.|$|E
