40|$|Abstract Legitimacy is at {{the heart}} of {{knowledge}} politics surrounding agriculture and food. When people accept industrial food practices as credible and authoritative, they are consenting to their use and existence. With their thick legitimacy, industrial food systems paralyze the growth of <b>alternative</b> <b>agricultures,</b> including agroecology. Questions of how <b>alternative</b> <b>agricultures</b> can attain their own thick legitimacy in order to compete with, and displace, that of industrial food have not yet attracted much scrutiny. We show that both agroecological and scientific legitimacy grow out of a web of legitimation processes in the scientific, policy, political, legal, practice, and civic arenas. Crucially, legitimation often comes through meeting what we call ‘credibility tests’. Agroecologists can learn to navigate these co-constituted, multiple bases of legitimacy by paying attention to how credibility tests are currently being set in each arena, and beginning to recalibrate these tests to open more room for agroecology. Using a schematic of three non-exclusive pathways, we explore some possible practical interventions that agroecologists and other advocates of <b>alternative</b> <b>agricultures</b> could take. These pathways include: leveraging, while also reshaping, the existing standards and practices of science; extending influence into policy, legal, practical, and civic arenas; and centering attention on the ethical legitimacy of food systems. We conclude that agroecologists can benefit from considering how to build legitimacy for their work...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{the first}} results of a Franco-Brazilian {{research}} project aimed at studying the trajectories of agroecology, this paper shows how the increasing place of agroecology in the landscape of <b>alternative</b> <b>agricultures</b> reveals profound reconfigurations within the agricultural world which involve and affect in return the academic and the professional worlds, the public policies and the social movements. A study of the processes of institutionalization of agroecology within agricultural institutions shows how agroecology appears as a new candidate for the ecologisation of agricultural policies and practices, also differently in Brazil and in France, where the legitimation through international institutions appears more significant. Complementarily, an analysis of a dozen key actors' trajectories in each country shows how agroecology finds its success {{at the crossroads of}} the academic world, the social movements and CSOs, the public policies and the leading agricultural institutions, although in different ways in the two countries...|$|R

40|$|<b>Alternative</b> {{food and}} <b>agriculture</b> {{movements}} increasingly rely on market-based approaches, particularly voluntary standards and certification, to advance environmental sustainability and social justice. Using {{a case study}} of an ecological shrimp project in Indonesia that became certified organic, this paper raises concerns regarding the impacts of certification on <b>alternative</b> food and <b>agriculture</b> movements, and their aims of furthering sustainability and justice. Drawing on George Ritzer’s McDonaldization framework, I argue that the ecological shrimp project became McDonaldized with the introduction of voluntary standards and certification. Specifically, efficiency, calculability, predictability, and control became key characteristics of the shrimp project. While the introduction of such characteristics increased market access, it also entailed significant costs, including an erosion of trust and marginalization and alienation of farmers. Given such tradeoffs, in concluding I propose that certification is producing particular forms of environmental sustainability and social justice, what I term McSustainability and McJustice. While enabling the expansion of <b>alternative</b> food and <b>agriculture,</b> McSustainability and McJustice tend to allow little opportunity for farmer empowerment and food sovereignty, as well as exclude aspects of sustainable farming or ethical production that are not easily measured, standardized, and validated...|$|R

5000|$|Although {{best known}} for her agrarian history, Joan Thirsk also had a strong {{interest}} in food history, especially in her later years. In 1995 she gave a paper on preserving food to the Leeds Symposium on the History of Food which was subsequently published. She advised on the curation of an exhibition: Fooles and Fricasees: Food in Shakespeare’s England at the Folger Shakespeare Library in 1999, contributing an essay: Food in Shakespeare’s England to the catalogue. Her thought- provoking book <b>Alternative</b> <b>Agriculture</b> (1997) considered the demand for food in England but her fully-fledged ideas on food history formed the subject of her last major work Food in Early Modern England Phases, Fads, Fashions 1500-1760. In this book Thirsk surveys the history of English food chronologically, taking information from scientific writers, cookery books, household accounts, and the food of the poor, followed by thematic sections looking closer at regional diets and individual foods. Throughout she tries to consider the diet of all social classes and is intent on dispelling the myth that the food of the bulk of the population at this time was dull and monotonous. Indeed, she argues the opposite- the range of plants and animals eaten at this time was much greater than commonly available today. The poor were diligent in gathering wild herbs and plants and at all levels of society food was discussed and appreciated. Her interest in food history was long evident at a personal level. She baked her own bread and a colleague recalls going to dinner with her in the 1970s and being served barley rolls with the soup- she wanted to see how palatable was pure barley bread (the stable food of many in sixteenth-century Southern England). All at dinner agreed that it was hard and difficult to eat! ...|$|E

40|$|The term “organic farming” first {{appeared}} in Lord Northbourne’s manifesto of organic agriculture, Look to the Land, published in 1940. This paper reveals how the outbreak of war in Europe in 1939 was the compelling reason for {{the writing of the}} book, and how the University of Oxford played key roles at important times in Northbourne’s life in shaping and sustaining his thinking. He was both a graduate in agriculture as well as a lecturer in agriculture of the university. This paper examines how and why the term ‘organic’ came to be, the timing of the term and the timing of the book, and why WWII was a crucial element in shaping Northbourne’s framing of the food contest of modern times as a contest of ‘organic versus chemical farming’. He foresaw this as a contest lasting decades, and ‘perhaps for centuries’. Northbourne’s book was prescient in flagging many pressing contemporary food issues including animal welfare, food localism, food sovereignty, food security, {{while at the same time}} criticising junk food, chemical reductionism, industrial farming, monoculture farming, and the view of food production as primarily an economics driven enterprise. Northbourne championed a holistic approach to problem solving rather than a reductionist approach, and this pervades his thinking. It led him to fraternise with the leading advocates of his time of <b>alternative</b> <b>agricultures</b> and it shaped his philosophy of agriculture. In the years since Look to the Land {{first appeared}}, a great deal has been written about the how to of organic farming, yet Northbourne remains unsurpassed as the master of the why-to of organic farming...|$|R
