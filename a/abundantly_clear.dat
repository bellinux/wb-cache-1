5|$|Since {{the fall}} of the Republic, the {{authority}} of the Roman Senate had largely eroded under the quasi-monarchical system of government established by Augustus, known as the Principate. The Principate allowed the existence of a de facto dictatorial regime, while maintaining the formal framework of the Roman Republic. Most Emperors upheld the public facade of democracy, and in return the Senate implicitly acknowledged the Emperor's status as a de facto monarch. The civil war of 69 had made it <b>abundantly</b> <b>clear</b> that real power in the Empire lay with control over the army. By the time Vespasian was proclaimed emperor in Rome, any hope of restoring the Republic had long dissipated.|$|E

[...] Alan Cooper testified first, that he had not signed or seen any papers related to Prenda, that [...] "Alan Cooper" [...] signatures on documents were not his, that he looked after one of John Steele's houses, and that Steele had stated he wanted to earn [...] "$10,000 a day" [...] litigating against downloaders, and that when Cooper had attempted to legally clarify that he was not the signatory of Prenda's documents, Steele began an escalating series of texts and voicemails whose interpretation (to White) clearly appeared to be intimidating Cooper into [...] "backing off". AT&T and Verizon, two major ISPs, testified that stays (court orders from other Prenda cases) had been ignored by Prenda and they were kept unaware of their issue. On the topic of Prenda's finances, Wright made clear that he viewed the clients as s that neither received settlement payments nor paid tax on any settlements, and that Prenda [...] "basically prosecuted on their own behalf". Of the four main Prenda attorneys, only Gibbs attended and testified, coming across to White as [...] "a young attorney out of his depth who fell in with the wrong crowd", but whose testimony in his own defense was contradicted at the hearing (Gibbs stated that he only had limited involvement in Prenda client [...] "AF Holdings" [...] but attorney Jason Sweet in the audience then stated to the court that Gibbs had previously self-identified as AF Holdings [...] "national counsel").|$|R

500|$|While Dear has {{received}} praise for [...] "remarkably... retain {{most of the}} source novel's complex plot and numerous characters", literary scholars have noted {{significant differences between the}} film and the source material. Sarah R. Morrison observes that the film's version of Anne articulates thoughts that the character would never say in the novel. Morrison cites Anne's adamant defence of her visit to Mrs. Smith—where Anne visits a poor old friend rather than go to the party of a titled relative—in the film as an example, as [...] "Austen's narrator makes it <b>abundantly</b> <b>clear</b> that Anne would never presume to dispute with her father upon such terms of absolute equality". The film's Anne also engages in actions not visible in the novel, such as her haste to stop Wentworth from leaving a musical concert when he feels demeaned by disparaging comments about his profession. Morrison attributes these differences to the difficulty in adapting novel to film, particularly as the latter form lacks a narrator to convey Anne's inner thoughts.|$|E

Young Britons answered the call, for King and Country, and voluntarily joined the British Army.

A feature of the volunteer army was the Pals battalions, recruited from single communities or even factories, who were allowed to serve together. The Kitchener recruitment campaign had proved to be very successful, as on September 1, 1914, over 30,000 men enlisted. With each day passing, thousands more were clamouring to be taken. The British Government soon realized the main drawback of this campaign, as opposed to the French and German conscriptions, which selected each individual men, a high proportion of men from skilled industries left their works, which would prove to be costly in the war effort. A better-controlled enlistment program would be required.|$|E
