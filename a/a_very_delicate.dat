5|$|The silk industry, however, did {{not gain}} any benefit from {{innovations}} in spinning, as silk is naturally already a thread. Making silk, silver, and gold brocades is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>delicate</b> and precise process, with each colour needing its own dedicated shuttle. In the 17th century and 18th centuries progress {{began to be}} made in the simplification and standardization of silk manufacture, with many advances following one after another. Bouchon and Falcon's punched card loom appeared in 1775, later improved on by Jacques de Vaucanson. Later, Joseph-Marie Jacquard improved on the designs of Falcon and Vaucanson, introducing the revolutionary Jacquard loom, which allowed a string of punched cards to be processed mechanically in the correct sequence. The punched cards of the Jacquard loom were a direct precursor to the modern computer, in that they gave a (limited) form of programmability. Punched cards themselves were carried over to computers, and were ubiquitous until their obsolescence in the 1970s. From 1801 embroidery became highly mechanized due to the effectiveness of the Jacquard loom. The mechanism behind the Jacquard loom even allowed complex designs to be mass-produced.|$|E

25|$|Chianti Classico are premium Chianti wines {{that tend}} to be medium-bodied with firm tannins and {{medium-high}} to high acidity. Floral, cherry and light nutty notes are characteristic aromas with the wines expressing more notes on the mid-palate and finish than {{at the front of}} the mouth. As with Bordeaux, the different zones of Chianti Classico have unique characteristics that can be exemplified and perceived in some wines from those areas. According to Master of Wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan, Chianti Classico wines from the Castellina area tend to have <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>delicate</b> aroma and flavour, Castelnuovo Berardegna wines tend to be the most ripe and richest tasting, wines from Gaiole tend to have been characterised by their structure and firm tannins while wines from the Greve area tend to have very concentrated flavours.|$|E

25|$|On March 26, 2007, Patrick and Robin {{argue over}} her {{decision}} to not move back into their apartment with him. She then goes over to Wyndemere to see Nikolas and asks if she can stay with him. Nikolas is not home at the time, and as she searches through his desk to find a paper to leave a note, she is stopped by Mr. Craig (Sebastian Roche), the head gunman from the Metro Court hostage crisis, and finds out he is blackmailing Nikolas for a new identity. When Nikolas returns home, he finds Robin tending to Craig's wound and finds out that Craig had decided Robin might be useful in his blackmail plot. Craig instructs Robin to go about her normal life and not {{to draw attention to}} herself. Also, she cannot not tell anybody—especially Patrick—and he makes numerous threats against Patrick to keep her in line. Robin goes about his instructions and gets into a fight with Patrick. On March 29, 2007, Patrick goes over to Wyndemere and demands that Nikolas tell him what is going on. Nikolas hesitates and Robin walks in. She can see Craig {{out of the corner of}} her eye, holding a gun. She fears for Patrick's safety, so she lies to him and tells him they are over. Later, Craig decides that a good cover story for Robin living at Wyndemere will be to have Robin and Nikolas play out a very public love affair. They agreed, fearing for their loved ones' lives. At the end of the day, Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) walks into Wyndemere, stopping dead in her tracks when she sees Robin and Nikolas in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>delicate</b> position on the couch. The two brush it off as though it is nothing, but Alexis is clearly suspicious. Robin and Patrick are reunited following an almost deadly confrontation with Mr Craig. Once Nik is in the clear for good, Robin and Patrick go home together.|$|E
500|$|... "Little Wing" [...] {{was one of}} {{only two}} songs from Axis that the Experience {{regularly}} performed in concert, the other being [...] "Spanish Castle Magic". [...] Except for the glockenspiel and the song's ending, their live performances generally follow the studio arrangement. Since the Axis recording ends on a fade, Hendrix needed to devise a different live ending. Early recordings show a progression to an open chord, while later ones have more elaborate single-string guitar improvisation with effects, such as wah-wah, before a chiming final chord. [...] For one 1968 performance in San Francisco, Hendrix's guitar signal was routed through a Leslie speaker. Writer Dave Rubin commented, [...] "the real Leslie played outdoors [...] like this really gives <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>delicate,</b> gentle swirl to the chords and helps the chordal embellishments in the intro". [...] This version was also rendered at a slower (56 bpm) tempo, making it somewhat longer (4:01).|$|E
500|$|Faust's initial writing {{staff at}} Hasbro Studios {{included}} several writers {{who had worked}} with her on her previous shows and were approved by Hasbro. These included Amy Keating Rogers, Cindy Morrow, Meghan McCarthy, Chris Savino, Charlotte Fullerton, M.A. Larson, and Dave Polsky. The writing process began with Faust and Renzetti coming up with broad plots for each show. The two would then hold a brainstorming session with each episode's writer, allowing the writer to script out scenes and dialogue. Faust and Renzetti then worked with the writer to finalize the scripts and assign some basic storyboard instructions. Hasbro was involved throughout this process and laid down some of the concepts to be incorporated into the show. Examples of Hasbro's influence include having Celestia be a princess rather than a queen, making one of the ponies focused on fashion, and portraying toy sets in relevant places within the story, such as Rarity's boutique. In some cases, Hasbro requested that the show include a setting, but allowed Faust and her team to create its visual style, and Hasbro then based the toy set on it; an example is the Ponyville schoolhouse. Faust also had to write to the E/I ("educational and informational") standards that Hasbro required of the show, making the crafting of some of the situations she would have normally done on other animated shows more difficult; for example, Faust cited having one character call another an [...] "egghead" [...] as [...] "treading <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>delicate</b> line", and having one character cheat in a competition as [...] "worrisome to some". Each episode also generally includes a moral or life lesson, but these were chosen to [...] "cross a broad spectrum of personal experiences", and not just to suit children. Because intellectual property issues had caused Hasbro to lose some of the rights on the original pony names, the show includes a mix of original characters from the toy line and new characters developed for the show.|$|E

500|$|While Johnny Depp was Burton's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Ichabod Crane, Paramount {{required}} him to consider Brad Pitt, Liam Neeson and Daniel Day-Lewis. Depp was cast in July 1998 for his third collaboration with Burton. The actor wanted Ichabod to parallel Irving's description of the character in the short story. This included a long prosthetic snipe nose, huge ears, and elongated fingers. Paramount turned down his suggestions, and after Depp read Tom Stoppard's rewrite of the script, he was inspired to take the character even further. [...] "I always thought of Ichabod as <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>delicate,</b> fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl," [...] Depp explained. He did not wish to portray the character as a typical action star would have, and instead took inspiration by Angela Lansbury's performance in Death on the Nile. [...] "It's good," [...] Burton reasoned, [...] "because I'm not the greatest action director in the world, and he's not the greatest action star." [...] Depp modeled Ichabod's detective personality from Basil Rathbone in the 1939 Sherlock Holmes film series. He also studied Roddy McDowall's acting for additional influence. Burton added that [...] "the idea was to try to find an elegance in action of the kind that Christopher Lee or Peter Cushing or Vincent Price had." [...] Christina Ricci, who worked with producer Scott Rudin on The Addams Family, was cast as Katrina Van Tassel. Sleepy Hollow also reunited Burton with Jeffrey Jones (from Beetlejuice and Ed Wood) as Reverend Steenwyck, Christopher Walken (Max Schreck in Batman Returns) as the Hessian Horseman, Martin Landau (Ed Wood) in a cameo role, and Hammer veteran Michael Gough (Alfred in Burton's Batman films), whom Burton tempted out of retirement. The Hammer influence was further confirmed by the casting of Christopher Lee in a small role as the Burgomaster who sends Crane to Sleepy Hollow.|$|E
2500|$|John Smid was {{the leader}} of Love In Action in Memphis.

[...] He has announced that he is still homosexual and admitted never seeing a man successfully converting to heterosexuality in his group.|$|E
2500|$|Depp's next {{venture with}} Burton was the period film Sleepy Hollow (1999), {{in which he}} played Ichabod Crane {{opposite}} Christina Ricci and Christopher Walken. For his performance, Depp took inspiration from Angela Lansbury, Roddy McDowall and Basil Rathbone. He stated that he [...] "always thought of Ichabod as <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>delicate,</b> fragile person who was maybe a little too {{in touch with his}} feminine side, like a frightened little girl." ...|$|E

2500|$|Italian winemakers {{have had}} a long history of using Slavonian oak from the Quercus robur which is known for its tight grain, low {{aromatics}} and medium level tannins. Slavonian oak tends to be used in larger barrel sizes (with less surface area relative to volume) with the same barrels reused for many more years before replacement. [...] Prior to the Russian Revolution, Quercus petraea oak from the Baltic/European states especially from Hungary was the most highly sought after wood for French winemaking. The trees in the Hungarian Zemplén Mountains grow slower in the volcanic soil and smaller, creating fine tight grain which sequentially lends itself to <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>delicate</b> extraction.|$|E

[...] Coppola opted to fall somewhere in the middle, with mixed results. Updating the story line was limited to changing Woody from a labor organizer to the manager of a sharecroppers' cooperative, making college-student Howard a research botanist, and a few minor changes to the lyrics in the Burton Lane-E. Y. Harburg score, such as changing a reference to Carmen Miranda to Zsa Zsa Gabor. Other than that, the plot remains firmly entrenched in an era that predates the Civil Rights Movement.|$|E

After Yanukovych's impeachment {{and the beginning of the}} Crimean crisis in February 2014, Hagel warned Russia against military maneuvers [...] "that could be misinterpreted, or lead to miscalculation during <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>delicate</b> time". In several phone calls with the Russian Minister of Defense Sergey Shoygu Hagel expressed deep concerns about Russian military activities near the Ukrainian border and called for an end of any [...] "destabilizing influence inside Ukraine".

2500|$|I think Walter is {{a writer}} at heart. Writers aren't always that good at {{communicating}} in person. He's also a tough son-of-a-bitch. He's like a cowboy.
