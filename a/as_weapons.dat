5|$|According to the game's back-story, Necrid {{was once}} a human warrior. He sought and found the cursed sword Soul Edge, only to be pulled into the {{dimension}} that the sword's spirit inhabits. Escaping the dimension with his body drastically mutated, his memories and sanity initially lost, he now wields various forms of energy <b>as</b> <b>weapons,</b> while searching for fragments of the shattered Soul Edge that soothe the pain caused by his separation from the dimension's energies.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} {{restaurants}} at Terminal 5, Plane Food cannot use gas equipment due to safety reasons and so electric ovens and hobs are used instead {{as well as}} a single microwave. The cutlery is also a standard airport size so that the knives cannot be used <b>as</b> <b>weapons.</b> Ramsay requires that staff who are working at Plane Food must gain work experience in another one of his restaurants first.|$|E

5|$|New {{gameplay}} features distinguish Shadow the Hedgehog {{from previous}} Sonic games.

Parts of the scenery, such as traffic signs, {{can also be used}} <b>as</b> <b>weapons.</b> Another new feature is the ability to drive vehicles, such as motorcycles and alien aircraft. Although Shadow can outrun the game's vehicles, the latter have unique capabilities, such as crushing enemies and traversing otherwise impassible acid-covered areas.|$|E

5|$|The Bold Orion missile, {{also known}} <b>as</b> <b>Weapons</b> System 199B (WS-199B), was a {{prototype}} air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) developed by Martin Aircraft during the 1950s. Developed in both one- and two-stage designs, the missile was moderately successful in testing, and helped {{pave the way}} for development of the GAM-87 Skybolt ALBM. In addition, the Bold Orion was used in early anti-satellite weapons testing, performing the first interception of a satellite by a missile.|$|E
5|$|The High Virgo, {{also known}} <b>as</b> <b>Weapons</b> System 199C (WS-199C), was a {{prototype}} air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) jointly developed by Lockheed and the Convair division of General Dynamics {{during the late}} 1950s.

5|$|The {{middle toe}} of the California condor's foot is greatly elongated, and the hind one is only {{slightly}} developed. The talons of all the toes are straight and blunt, and are thus more adapted to walking than gripping.

5|$|A former film studio {{located on}} Eastern Avenue was {{designated}} as a temporary detention centre for individuals arrested during the summit. Toronto Police Service announced that Trinity Bellwoods Park would be the designated protest area, but following opposition from local residents, police relocated the designated protest zone to {{the northern part of}} Queen's Park. Canada Post declared that it would remove post boxes in the security zone. Toronto Parking Authority removed some parking meters as well. Small trees along sidewalks around the convention centre were removed to prevent them from being used <b>as</b> <b>weapons</b> by protesters. Other removed municipal properties include 745 newspaper boxes, 200 public trash cans, 70 mailboxes, 29 bus shelters, and 5 public information boards.|$|E

5|$|A {{major change}} from The Two Towers is the {{interactive}} {{nature of the}} game environments. The player can operate machinery, for example bridges and catapults, to complete objectives, and use environmental objects <b>as</b> <b>weapons,</b> such as spears and cauldrons, to kill enemies. The levels are also {{twice the size of}} the largest level from The Two Towers and many are less linear. Unlike The Two Towers, The Return of the King features a co-op mode, allowing two players to play through the game together. The North American PlayStation 2 version also has an online multiplayer mode, with USB headset support, although this was removed from the European version of the game.|$|E
5|$|Additional modes can be {{unlocked}} in the game. For Boss Rush Mode, {{the player}} {{is required to}} complete the game once and can then fight the bosses from the game in order {{with the number of}} bosses depending on the level of difficulty selected. Maxim Mode requires the player to finish the game with the best ending and allows the player to take control of Maxim. Unlike Juste, Maxim cannot equip items and can only use his sword and giant shuriken (sub weapon) <b>as</b> <b>weapons.</b> Maxim also has the ability to triple jump and cast certain spells by inputting certain combinations on the buttons. Finishing with the best ending also unlocks an option to listen to the music of the game.|$|E

5|$|Colin Renfrew {{has pointed}} out the dangers of {{applying}} modern values of art to past societies and cultures. Günter Berghaus argues that these works have often been approached {{with a set of}} post-Renaissance aesthetic values that distinguish between artists and craftsman and art and artifact, although these categories are not universal and may be inappropriate for understanding prehistoric society. Duncan Garrow has pointed to the difficulties of the modern distinction drawn between form and decoration. The emphasis in studies of prehistoric art tend to be placed on decoration in objects such as ceramics and ignores the importance of form, found in objects such <b>as</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|E
