5|$|Operations in Borneo were {{extremely}} sensitive and they received little press coverage in Australia, while official <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> involvement in cross-border missions only occurred in 1996. Following {{a military coup}} in Indonesia in early 1966 which brought General Suharto to power, a peace treaty was signed in August 1966 which ended the conflict. 3,500 Australians served during Confrontation; casualties included 16 dead, with seven killed in action and eight wounded.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata {{in his first}} year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, about three months after taking office at the end of May 1723. A festive service at the Nikolaikirche was an annual event, celebrating the inauguration of a new town council, always held on the Monday after St. Bartholomew (August 24). The text by an anonymous poet includes psalm verses and an excerpt from Martin Luther's German Te Deum. It is focused on <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> authority as a gift of God, thanks for past blessings, and prayer for future help.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] is a Japanese family registry. Japanese law {{requires}} all Japanese households (ie) to report births, <b>acknowledgements</b> <b>of</b> paternity, adoptions, disruptions of adoptions, deaths, marriages and divorces of Japanese citizens {{to their local}} authority, which compiles such records encompassing all Japanese citizens within their jurisdiction. Marriages, adoptions and <b>acknowledgements</b> <b>of</b> paternity become legally effective only when such events are recorded in the koseki. Births and deaths become legally effective as they happen, but such events must be filed by family members.|$|R

Kirshenbaum, for [...] "their contributions in the experimental work." ...|$|R
5|$|In {{terms of}} any <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> the mutual {{existence}} between the scriptores, only Flavius Vopiscus (ostensibly writing in 305 or 306) refers {{to any of}} the other authors (specifically Trebellius Pollio, Julius Capitolinus and Aelius Lampridius). None of the other five demonstrate any awareness of the existence of any of their 'colleagues'. However, these references cause difficulties when these authors also address Constantine in their dedications, as Vopiscus was also doing. For instance, Capitolinus mostly addresses Diocletian, but in the Albinus, Maximini and Gordiani he addresses Constantine in a fashion that suggests he is writing after 306.|$|E
5|$|King of the North Robb Stark visits his {{prisoner}} Jaime Lannister, informing Jaime that Robb {{has received}} Stannis' letter about Cersei's children being Jaime's, and surmises {{that his brother}} Bran was crippled and his father was killed because they had discovered this themselves. Robb also informs Jaime {{that he intends to}} send Jaime's cousin, Alton Lannister, who also has been captured by the Northern army, to King's Landing with terms for peace. His demands include the release of his sisters Sansa and Arya, the return of the remains of Eddard and his household for proper burial, and the <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> the Northern independence.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{approach to}} the house {{would have been far}} more impressive than the picturesque approach today. The east front was then the entrance façade and faced onto a large entrance court. The two remaining pavilions flanked a large gatehouse; this long-demolished structure contained secondary lodgings. In turn, the entrance court and gatehouse were approached through a larger outer court. The courts were however not fortified, but bordered by ornate balustrading, which with the ogee roofs of the pavilions, which in reality were follies, were a purely ornamental and domestic <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> the fortified courts and approaches found in earlier medieval English manors and castles.|$|E

5|$|Upholding {{the concept}} of {{representative}} democracy requires the protection of freedom of expression. This paves the way for discussion {{of the state of}} affairs in the country, as expressed by representatives of the people, which include members of the ruling party elected into government as well as opposition politicians. Free discourse about political ideas and government plans can facilitate the <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> current weaknesses or limitations. This is justified in the name of public interest as the legislature, administration and governmental institutions will then strive to make improvements.|$|E
5|$|Benbow {{continued}} {{aboard the}} Sovereign throughout 1691, {{and by the}} summer of 1692, was again master of the fleet, this time under Admiral Edward Russell, then aboard the Britannia. Benbow worked closely with his old colleague David Mitchell, then serving as Russell's first captain, and Josiah Burchett, Russell's clerk. Benbow may have advised Russell to take the Gull Passage inside the Goodwin Sands to the Downs, where they linked up with the Dutch forces. Benbow served as master of the fleet during the Battles of Barfleur and La Hogue. After the battles, Benbow returned to Deptford to resume his duties as master attendant, spending a brief period at Portsmouth Dockyard helping to oversee repairs to the fleet. He had already had his pay upgraded to that of a master attendant, he was now to be paid as a master, in addition to his master attendant's wage, presumably as an <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> his special services.|$|E
5|$|In February 1930, a Towle TA-2 {{amphibian}} was {{a visitor}} to Lympne. In July 1930, it was notified that aircraft fitted with radio may report their position by radio when crossing the Channel. For non-radio aircraft the earlier arrangements remained in effect, although some changes {{were made to the}} methods of <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> arrival. Search and rescue arrangements now included motorboats permanently available at Boulogne, Calais, Dover and Dunquerque. Lifeboats were also on standby at the French ports and air patrols were in operation during working hours, operated by Air Union. In August 1930, the arrangements for non-radio aircraft flying between Croydon and Lympne in bad weather were amended. Pilots had to notify which route they intended to take and the destination airfield was to be notified of this by telephone once the aircraft had departed. That month 601 (County of London) Squadron held its annual camp a Lympne.|$|E

5|$|In May 2009, the Joint Working Party (JWP) of IUPAC {{published}} {{a report on}} the discovery of copernicium in which they acknowledged the discovery of the isotope 283Cn. This implied the discovery of flerovium, from the <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> the data for the synthesis of 287Fl and 291Lv, which decay to 283Cn. The discovery of the isotopes flerovium-286 and -287 was confirmed in January 2009 at Berkeley. This was followed by confirmation of flerovium-288 and -289 in July 2009 at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Germany. In 2011, IUPAC evaluated the Dubna team experiments of 1999–2007. They found the early data inconclusive, but accepted the results of 2004–2007 as flerovium, and the element was officially recognized as having been discovered.|$|E
5|$|On 10 January 1917, {{manned by}} an almost entirely new crew, Aurora arrived at Cape Evans {{and picked up}} the seven {{survivors}} of the Ross Sea shore party; Mackintosh, Victor Hayward and Arnold Spencer-Smith had all died. This was the vessel's final visit to Antarctic waters; on return to New Zealand it was sold by Shackleton to a coal carrier. Aurora left Newcastle, New South Wales, on 20 June 1917 bound for Chile, and was never seen again, officially posted as missing by Lloyd's of London on 2 January 1918. Among those lost was James Paton, who had acted as the ship's boatswain throughout the Ross Sea Party expedition and the drift, and on the subsequent relief mission. In 1920 King George V appointed Joseph Stenhouse an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), in <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> his service aboard Aurora.|$|E
5|$|The British {{policy of}} salutary neglect for its North American colonies {{intended}} to minimise trade restrictions {{as a way}} of ensuring they stayed loyal to British interests. This permitted the development of the American Dream, a cultural spirit distinct from that of its European founders. The Thirteen Colonies of British America began an armed rebellion against British rule in 1775 when they rejected the right of the Parliament of Great Britain to govern them without representation; they proclaimed their independence in 1776, and constituted the first thirteen states of the United States of America, which became a sovereign state in 1781 with the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. The 1783 Treaty of Paris represented Great Britain's formal <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> the United States' sovereignty {{at the end of the}} American Revolutionary War.|$|E
