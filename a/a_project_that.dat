5|$|HAT-P-33b's {{existence}} was first suggested after observations by the six-telescope HATnet collaboration, <b>a</b> <b>project</b> <b>that</b> searches {{the sky for}} planets in transit of, or crossing in front of, their host stars. The presence of a planet in HAT-P-33's orbit had been suspected as early as 2004, although high levels of jitter were detected. This jitter, or a random and shaky appearance that clouds the accuracy of measurements, {{made it difficult to}} easily verify the radial velocity of the planetary candidate's host star, which usually leads summarily to the planet's confirmation.|$|E
5|$|He {{joined the}} Norwegian Home Guard after the war, {{where he served}} as a captain. He {{completed}} education in law, and also worked as a judge and lawyer. He ultimately reached the rank of colonel in the military, as military lawyer of a branch of the Royal Norwegian Air Force. For some years he was CEO of <b>a</b> <b>project</b> <b>that</b> planned to develop the Vaterland neighbourhood in Oslo. Gjems-Onstad also had a career in sports, representing the sports club SK Rye in cycling and racewalking.

5|$|In 1880 he {{designed}} an electric lighting project for Barcelona's Muralla de Mar, or seawall, {{which was not}} carried out. It consisted of eight large iron streetlamps, profusely decorated with plant motifs, friezes, shields and names of battles and Catalan admirals. The same year he participated in the competition {{for the construction of}} the San Sebastián social centre (now town hall), won by Luis Aladrén Mendivi and Adolfo Morales de los Ríos; Gaudí submitted <b>a</b> <b>project</b> <b>that</b> synthesised several of his earlier studies, such as the fountain for the Plaça Catalunya and the courtyard of the Provincial Council.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, {{jet engine}} {{engineer}} Stanley Hooker of the Bristol Engine Company informed aeronautics engineer Sydney Camm of Hawker Aircraft that Bristol {{had been working}} <b>a</b> <b>project</b> <b>that</b> combined major elements of their Olympus and Orpheus jet engines to produce a directable fan jet. The projected fan jet harnessed rotatable cold jets which were positioned {{on either side of}} the compressor along with a 'hot' jet which was directed via a conventional central tailpipe. The original concept upon which the engine, which had been named Pegasus, was based came from Michel Wibault, a French aviation consultant. Several adaptions and enhancements were made by Bristol to reduce size and weight over Wibault's original concept.|$|E
5|$|In October 2008, Nassau County Legislator David Denenberg {{demonstrated}} {{with ten}} civic leaders {{in front of}} the NYSDOT building in East Meadow about the slow progress of construction on the NY102 (Front Street) overpass. Construction was causing rush hour traffic to back up for miles near the Hempstead Turnpike (NY24) exit, and evidence showed no work had been done for several months. After residents and commuters started demanding answers, NYSDOT stated that <b>a</b> <b>project</b> <b>that</b> began as just basic bridge repair had become a larger-scale project that required a redesign {{due to the fact that}} the bridge had more damage than initially realized.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, {{upgrades}} {{were made}} to the portion of U.S. Route 202 concurrent with Route 23. This portion of road, which was originally a four-lane undivided road, saw an upgrade to a six-lane freeway south of the Alps Road interchange and to a six-lane surface road north of there. Construction on these improvements was completed in 1986. There were also plans to replace the Flemington Circle with an interchange as part of <b>a</b> <b>project</b> <b>that</b> would have also built a limited-access bypass of Flemington for Route 31; however, this plan was never realized.|$|E
5|$|M-73 was {{designated}} by July 1, 1919, {{along with the}} rest of the initial state trunkline highway system. In 1937, the highway was completely hard-surfaced for the first time. Its routing has been largely unchanged since designation. The original bridge over the Brule River was built in 1922. In a joint project with the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT), MDOT funded a replacement in 2003. WisDOT supervised construction of the new span in <b>a</b> <b>project</b> <b>that</b> ran between July 14 and November 4, 2003.|$|E
5|$|No {{one took}} over as {{paramount}} chief upon Atangana's death. His opulent palace went unoccupied and fell into ruins. However, traditional Cameroonian chieftaincies were re-established on 11 July 1977 by Decree #77/609, and by the 1990s, Cameroonian ethnic groups had rejuvenated these dormant traditions. Atangana's daughter Marie-Thérèse became the new Ewondo paramount chief. In December 2000, she began the renovation of his palace at Efoulan, Yaoundé, <b>a</b> <b>project</b> <b>that</b> would cost an estimated 150,000,000 francsCFA.|$|E

In <b>a</b> <b>project</b> <b>that</b> finished in 2015, Reading station was redeveloped {{at a cost of}} £850m, with grade separation of some conflicting traffic flows, and extra platforms, to relieve severe congestion at this station. Railway lines link Reading to both Paddington and Waterloo stations in London. Other stations in the Reading area are Reading West, Tilehurst and Earley. Green Park railway station is planned on the Reading to Basingstoke Line to serve Green Park Business Park.|$|E
5|$|The first {{plans to}} {{undertake}} a major restoration of Mdina's walls were made in 2006, as part of <b>a</b> <b>project</b> <b>that</b> also included restoration of the fortifications of Valletta, Birgu and the Cittadella. In the case of Mdina, the main focus was to consolidate the terrain, since the city is built on a blue clay plateau which is prone to subsidence. The multimillion-euro restoration was partially financed by the European Regional Development Fund. Works began in early 2008 by the Restoration Unit. The process of restoration was documented by Dr. Spiteri.|$|E
5|$|While Argentina's {{finances}} {{were extremely}} strained {{at this juncture}} following the economic crisis in 1953, the most serious setback to the project came in January 1955 when Tank's contract expired. He reputedly requested almost twice as much money to continue but President Perón instead canceled his contract outright. Despite four years of development and trials, the IAe 33 project was still encountering teething problems and its status remained unclear although no final decision {{had been made to}} abandon <b>a</b> <b>project</b> <b>that</b> had reached iconic stature in the Perónist era.|$|E
