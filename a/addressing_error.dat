Spatial addressing allows unlimited numbers of qubits to share the same frequency, whilst enabling arbitrary parallel operations. We demonstrate addressing of long-lived ^ 43 Ca^+ "atomic clock" qubits held in separate zones of a microfabricated surface trap with integrated microwave electrodes. By coherently cancelling the microwave field in one zone we measure a ratio of Rabi frequencies between addressed and non-addressed qubits of up to 1400, implying an <b>addressing</b> <b>error</b> of 1. 3 × 10 ^- 6. Off-resonant excitation prevents this error level being directly demonstrated, but we also show polarization control of the microwave field with error 2 × 10 ^- 5, sufficient to suppress off-resonant excitation out of the qubit states to the ∼ 10 ^- 9 level. Such polarization control could enable fast microwave operations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: AECL and CANDU {{utilities}} {{have developed}} a process for minimizing human error in plant operations and maintenance. Recent plant operational experience demonstrates that human error is a key contributor to operating inefficiencies, equipment damage, and significant plant events. To improve plant operation and safety, plant designers and utilities are placing renewed emphasis on approaches {{to prevent the occurrence}} and limit the effects of human error. One aspect of the multifaceted approach to <b>addressing</b> <b>error</b> involves the choice of features that are incorporated into plant systems. This paper discusses the systematic approach developed, outlines the principles and general process adopted for avoiding human error in design, and describes design solutions that are representative of specific application principles. It is expected that application of the recommended approach will result in plant designs with decreased risk of human error occurrence and consequence. 1...|$|E

In this paper, in response to limitations of current Software Defined Networking (SDN) management solutions, we propose a recursive approach to enterprise network management, where network management is done through managing various Virtual Transport Networks (VTNs). Different from the traditional virtual network model which mainly focuses on routing/tunneling, our VTN provides communication service with explicit Quality-of-Service (QoS) support for applications via transport flows, and it involves all mechanisms (e:g:, routing, <b>addressing,</b> <b>error</b> and flow control, resource allocation) needed to support such transport flows. Based on this approach, we design and implement a management layer, which recurses the same VTN-based management mechanism for enterprise network management. Comparing with an SDN-based management approach, our experimental results show that our management layer achieves better network performance...|$|E

Another type of <b>addressing</b> <b>error</b> is forgetting to add an intended collaborator as recipient, a likely source of costly misunderstandings and communication delays in large corporations.

In spite of interface, privacy and speed constraints, results were fairly positive. More than 15 % of the users reported that the client prevented real cases of email leaks, and more than 47 % of them accepted recommendations provided by the data mining techniques. We then conclude by presenting a few lessons learned from this deployment, and discussing costs and benefits of making these techniques permanent additions to email clients...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Linear Hashing is an {{efficient}} and widely used version of extensible hash-ing. LH ∗ is its distributed version that stores key-value pairs {{on up to}} hundreds of thousands of sites in a distributed system. LH ∗ implements the dictionary data struc-ture efficiently by not using a central component and allows the key-based operations of insertion, deletion, actualization, and retrieval as well as the scan operation. Be-cause it does not use a central addressing component, clients or servers in LH ∗ can commit an <b>addressing</b> <b>error</b> by sending a request to a wrong server. This server then forwards the message to the correct server either directly or in one but never more than one additional forward operation. We discuss here methods to avoid this dou-ble forward, which, while rare, still might breach quality of service guarantees. We compare our methods with LH∗RSP 2 P that pushes information about changes in the file structure to clients, whether they are active or not. A second problem especially relevant in high churn environments such as modern data centers is that sites can suddenly become inaccessible. The various high and scalable reliability versions of LH ∗ then reconstruct the data lost on this site elsewhere. We present a solution to the resulting “wandering bucket ” problem that allows clients to find the data at their new location...|$|E
40|$|This thesis reports high-fidelity {{near-field}} spatial microwave addressing of long-lived 43 Ca + "atomic clock" qubits {{performed in}} a two-zone single-layer surface-electrode ion trap. Addressing is implemented by using two of the trap's integrated microwave electrodes, one in each zone, to drive single-qubit rotations in the zone we choose to address whilst interferometrically cancelling the microwave field at the neighbour (non-addressed) zone. Using this field-nulling scheme, we measure a Rabi frequency ratio between addressed and non-addressed zones of up to 1400, from which we calculate an <b>addressing</b> <b>error</b> (or a spin-flip probability on the qubit transition) of 1 e- 6. Off-resonant excitation out of the qubit state is a more significant source of error in this experiment, but we also demonstrate polarisation control of the microwave field at an error level of 2 e- 5, which, if combined with individual-ion addressing, would be sufficient to suppress off-resonant excitation errors to the 1 e- 9 level. Further, this thesis presents preliminary results obtained with a micron-scale coupled-microstrip differential antenna probe that can be scanned over an ion-trap chip to map microwave magnetic near fields. The probe is designed to enable the measurement of fields at tens of microns above electrode surfaces and {{to act as an}} effective characterisation tool, speeding up design-fabrication-characterisation cycles in the production of new prototype microwave ion-trap chips. Finally, a new multi-layer design for an ion-trap chip which displays, in simulations, a 100 -fold improvement in addressing performance, is presented. The chip electrode structure is designed to use the cancelling effect of microwave return currents to produce Rabi frequency ratios of order 1000 between trap zones using a single microwave electrode (i. e. without the need for nulling fields). If realised, this chip could be used to drive individually addressed single-qubit operations on arrays of memory qubits in parallel and with high fidelity. </p...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{develop an}} {{evidence-based}} structured algorithm tool {{that might be}} used by nursing leaders at a cancer center to decrease chemotherapy medication errors. Background. In spite of available technology and known factors resulting in medication errors, chemotherapy errors remain the major cause of iatrogenic patient morbidity in hospitals (Gilbar, 2001; Heidt et al., 2001). A major risk factor for chemotherapy errors is lack of standardization in administration (ordering, dispensing, administration, monitoring). Failure to identify necessary staff skills/aptitude required to prevent errors may also be problematic. Significance. Use of the developed algorithm may lead to development of evidence-based strategies to decrease errors in chemotherapy administration in cancer patients. Methods. A comprehensive review of literature related to Chemotherapy Administration and medication errors was performed. Search included the following: Science Direct, CINAHL, Pub Med, MEDLINE, Expanded Academics. Search limits included publication within 10 years, peer reviewed journals, English. Primary key words: 2 ̆ 2 chemotherapy process, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 medication error, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 error prevention, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 error rate, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 protocol violation. 2 ̆ 2 Secondary search terms: 2 ̆ 2 Medication Use Process, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 tumor biology and kinetics, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 protocol guidelines, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 risk management, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 prevention strategies, 2 ̆ 2 utilization of 2 ̆ 2 information technology systems. 2 ̆ 2 Articles <b>addressing</b> <b>error</b> reduction and standardized verification of treatment/dosing were reviewed. Data sources examined reduced error rates, and consisted of books, articles, and abstracts from scientific conferences. Findings. Several sources support chemotherapy error reduction is achievable through use of evidence-based strategies. Standardizing formats through procedures/protocols reduces potential for medication errors. Integration of information systems elements such as Computer Prescribing Order Entry, Bar-coded medication administration, Electronic medication administration records, Automated dispensing machines and IV PumpGuardrails decrease errors in medication administration. Other strategies that enhance error reduction for chemotherapy were Standardized Ordering Forms, Infusion-related Hypersensitivity Reaction information and Adverse Reaction guidelines, Extravasation Management Protocols, Verification Grids, and Standardized Patient Identifiers. A decision-tree algorithm incorporating all aspects of this evidence was developed. Implications to practice. The practical implication of this project is that standardized protocols for medication administration, information systems strategies, {{and a variety of}} other techniques aimed at specific points in the error process may reduce error rates and assist in improved outcomes related to medication safety, in particular, chemotherapy administration. Recommendations. The utilization of an algorithm should be tested in clinical practice to determine the effect on chemotherapy error rates...|$|E
