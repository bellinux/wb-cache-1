25|$|Note that {{up until}} now much of the above {{paragraph}} could apply to octopuses, mollusks, worms, insects and things more primitive; <b>anything</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> more concentrated nervous system and better eyes than say a jellyfish. However, the following applies to mammals generally and birds (in modified form): The retina in these more complex animals sends fibers (the optic nerve) to the lateral geniculate nucleus, to the primary and secondary visual cortex of the brain. Signals from the retina can also travel directly from the retina to the superior colliculus.|$|E
25|$|Olanzapine is {{associated}} with the highest placental exposure of any atypical antipsychotic. Despite this, the available evidence suggests it is safe during pregnancy, although the evidence is insufficiently strong to say <b>anything</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high degree of confidence. Olanzapine {{is associated}} with weight gain which according to recent studies may put olanzapine-treated patients' offspring at a heightened risk for neural tube defects (e.g. spina bifida). Breastfeeding in women taking olanzapine is advised against {{due to the fact that}} olanzapine is secreted in breast milk with one study finding that the exposure to the infant (in mg per kg of body weight, that is) is about 1.8% that to the mother.|$|E
25|$|After the Royals {{failed to}} do <b>anything</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lead-off double from Hosmer {{in the top of}} the 5th, the Giants tied the game in the bottom of the inning. Joe Panik started the inning with a double to right-center, which knocked Vargas out of the game. Jason Frasor was brought in. A groundout moved Panik to third, and he scored on a single to center by Hunter Pence. Danny Duffy {{replaced}} Frasor in the game. Pablo Sandoval singled and Brandon Belt walked to load the bases. Juan Pérez hit a sinking liner to center, but it was caught by a diving Jarrod Dyson. Pence tagged up at third and scored the tying run. Duffy struck out Brandon Crawford to end the inning.|$|E

Jack represents a new character archetype, which other writers have begun to draw from. For example, comic book writer Peter David reflects that in writing Marvel Comics character Shatterstar, he [...] "to some degree... key his personality off Captain Jack Harkness" [...] insofar as he is [...] "swashbuckling, enthusiastic and sexually curious about <b>anything</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pulse". In 2009, Barrowman's variety show Tonight's the Night broadcast a specially written humorous [...] scripted by Russell T Davies. In the scene, Barrowman appears initially as Captain Jack confronting an alien on board the TARDIS who claims to be the Doctor. However, David Tennant appears as himself and John Barrowman is revealed as playing Captain Jack in the TARDIS set.

2500|$|By Midsummer 2006, the Sunday Times had discerned a {{trend that}} fused aspects of boho-chic with [...] "heavy metal attitude": [...] "It's about wearing a studded leather jacket with a flimsy chiffon number, stomping about town in biker boots ... and wearing <b>anything</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> skull on it".
