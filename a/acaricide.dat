2500|$|Parathion, {{also called}} {{parathion}}-ethyl or diethyl parathion and locally known as [...] "Folidol", is an organophosphate compound possessing a organothiophosphate group. It {{is a potent}} insecticide and <b>acaricide.</b> It was originally developed by IG Farben in the 1940s. It is highly toxic to non-target organisms, including humans. [...] Its use is banned or restricted in many countries, and there are proposals to ban it from all use. The basic structure is shared by parathion methyl.|$|E
2500|$|DDT {{is similar}} in {{structure}} to the insecticide methoxychlor and the <b>acaricide</b> dicofol. It is highly hydrophobic and nearly insoluble in water but has good solubility in most organic solvents, fats and oils. DDT does not occur naturally and is synthesised by a Friedel–Crafts hydroxyalkylation reaction between chloral (...) and chlorobenzene (...) , {{in the presence of}} an acidic catalyst. DDT has been marketed under trade names including Anofex, Cezarex, Chlorophenothane, Clofenotane, Dicophane, Dinocide, Gesarol, Guesapon, Guesarol, Gyron, Ixodex, Neocid, Neocidol and Zerdane.|$|E
2500|$|Endosulfan is an off-patent {{organochlorine}} insecticide and <b>acaricide</b> {{that is being}} phased out globally. The two isomers, endo and exo, are known popularly as I and II. [...] Endosulfan sulfate {{is a product of}} oxidation containing one extra O atom attached to the S atom. Endosulfan became a highly controversial agrichemical due to its acute toxicity, potential for bioaccumulation, and role as an endocrine disruptor. Because of its threats to human health and the environment, a global ban on the manufacture and use of endosulfan was negotiated under the Stockholm Convention in April 2011. The ban has taken effect in mid-2012, with certain uses exempted for five additional years. More than 80 countries, including the European Union, Australia, New Zealand, several West African nations, the United States, Brazil, and Canada had already banned it or announced phase-outs by the time the Stockholm Convention ban was agreed upon. It is still used extensively in India, China, and few other countries. It is produced by Makhteshim Agan and several manufacturers in India and China. Although, the Supreme Court had, by an order dated 13.05.2011, put a ban on the production and sale of endosulfan in India till further orders.|$|E

40|$|Insecticides and <b>acaricides</b> are {{commonly}} used on anthurium (Anthurium andraeanum Andre) to produce marketable flowers. A limiting factor in using certain insecticides and <b>acaricides</b> on anthurium is phytotoxicity, or plant injuries resulting from pesticide applications. Phytotoxic responses differ among anthurium cultivars; an insecticide that is safe on one cultivar may not be safe on another.

40|$|Abstract. Honey was {{subjected}} to GC-MS analysis {{in order to identify}} and quantify <b>acaricides</b> residues (2, 4 –dimethylaniline, brompropilate, amitraz, coumaphos, fluvalinate). Two rapid methods were compared for the extraction and purification of <b>acaricides</b> from honey. First method uses as extraction solvent acetonitrile in the presence of high quantities of salts, which underwent a clean up step known like dispersive solid-phase extraction dSPE PSA (QuEChERS method). In the second method the <b>acaricides</b> were eluted with dichloromethane from the mixture of the sample with diatomaceous earth. Both methods offered the extraction of all mentioned <b>acaricides,</b> but the second one offered higher recoveries, lower costs and was less time consuming for sample preparation. LOD for all <b>acaricides</b> ranged from 0. 8 – 8. 3 µg/kg and for LOQ between 1 and 9. 7 µg/kg. Higher recovery rates (90 – 108 %) were obtained when sample preparation involved diatomaceous earth...|$|R

50|$|Mites infesting {{their hosts}} at the outer {{surface of the}} skin are removed by {{treatment}} with topically applied <b>acaricides</b> (chemicals to kill mites and ticks applied to the skin). Numerous commercial formulations are available, representing several different chemical groups. Examples are: synthetic pyrethroids such as flumethrin; formamidines such as amitraz; and phenylpyrazoles such as fipronil. Botanical <b>acaricides</b> are represented by azadirachtin, an extract of the neem tree. Aqueous suspensions of fungi naturally pathogenic to mites, such as Metarhizium anisopliae, are another potential alternative to chemical <b>acaricides.</b> Good potential for vaccination of sheep to control Psoroptes ovis infestation has been demonstrated.|$|R

These can be applied as aqueous washes in dipping baths, or as pour-on preparations in an oily formulation that spreads over the skin. Dip baths used to be commonly used for applying <b>acaricides</b> to sheep (also cattle). However, alternatives such as hand-held sprayers and pour-on applicators are now often used to reduce costs and risk of contamination associated with running a dip tank.

50|$|Synthetic {{chemical}} pesticides specific for ticks (<b>acaricides)</b> {{are suspended}} {{in water for}} application to the hair coat of domestic animals. Cattle can be immersed in dip-baths containing dipwash, or soaked using a pressurized spray-race made of metal tubing and nozzles. Sheep can be treated in smaller dips or showers. <b>Acaricides</b> {{can be applied to}} dogs in watery shampoo formulations. Acaricide-active ingredients are usually soluble in oil. This makes them suitable for concentrated oily formulations which spread from a pour-on applicator over the hair coat. Alternatively, some <b>acaricides</b> are incorporated in polyvinylchoride plastic ear tags for cattle, or collars for dogs. 7 Modern <b>acaricides</b> belong to the general classes of organophosphates (example chlorfenvinphos), formamidines (example amitraz), synthetic pyrethroids (example flumethrin), phenylpyrazoles (example fipronil), and benzylphenyl ureas (example fluazuron). 2 When correctly applied, they can be highly effective. Problems with <b>acaricides</b> are: danger of acute poisoning of treated animals and human staff; residues contaminating meat and milk; environmental contamination especially water sources; resistance that ticks acquire to acaricides; and cost of application. Cost and contamination can be reduced by seasonal timing of application (strategic treatment) based on ecological knowledge. Prediction of best times for treatment can be made using computerized models of the population dynamics of ticks. Farmers lacking sufficient cash to purchase manufactured synthetic <b>acaricides</b> often use various herbal treatments, locally available. Nicotine as treated tobacco leaf is an example, but such unregistered preparations require careful use to avoid poisoning or skin damage.|$|R

The prevalence of resistant strains of Rhipicephalus microplus to different <b>acaricides</b> on cattle {{farms in the}} tropical region of Tecpan of Galeana, Guerrero, Mexico, and {{risk factors related to}} prevalence of resistant strains of R. microplus. Sixty one ranches infested were sampled; in each ranch were collected 30 - 50 fully-engorged female R. microplus ticks, of 10 cattle randomly selected, and evaluated in their progeny resistance to <b>acaricides,</b> using the larval packet test. The prevalence of resistant strains was total pyrethroids and amitraz. In organophosphorus 31. 1, 48. 3 and 82. 2 % of strains were resistant to clorpyriphos, coumaphos and diazinon, respectively. Risk factors favored (P< 0. 05) the development of resistant strains of <b>acaricides.</b> We concluded that the resistance of R. microplus to <b>acaricides</b> used to control a problem, and risk factors (livestock management) have accelerated the development of resistance...|$|R
25|$|Another crucial {{preventive}} measure {{is the use}} of persistent <b>acaricides,</b> such as topical repellents or pesticides that contain triazapentadienes (Amitraz), phenylpyrazoles (Fipronil), or permethrin (pyrethroids). These <b>acaricides</b> target primarily the adult stages of Lyme-carrying ticks and reduce the number of reproductively active ticks in the environment. Formulations of these ingredients are available in a variety of topical forms, including spot-ons, sprays, powders, impregnated collars, solutions, and shampoos.|$|R
40|$|The {{predatory mite}} Euseius alatus DeLeon has been {{reported}} in several economic crops in Brazil, with certified importance in fruit trees and coffee. In order to establish an integrated pest management program it is important to determine the efficient pesticides in pests control, but presenting low impact to predators. This work had the objective of evaluating the toxicity of <b>acaricides</b> (abamectin, azocyclotin, diafenthiuron, dicofol, sulphur, fenpropathrin, fenpyroximate, propargite, tetradifon) to eggs and adult females of E. alatus. Leaf discs of "feijão de porco" (Canavalia ensiformes L.) containing 10 eggs of E. alatus were immersed into the <b>acaricides</b> dilutions, during five seconds, and dried for 30 minutes under room temperature. Treated eggs were observed up to 72 h to determine egg survival. The residual effect of the same <b>acaricides</b> to adult females of E. alatus was studied using arena constituted by treated leaf disc. Ten adult females were confined per arena, 30 minutes, 24 h and 72 h after immersing the discs into the <b>acaricides</b> dilutions. Mortality was measured 24, 48 and 72 h after confining the females on the treated leaf discs. All tested <b>acaricides</b> showed low impact on egg survival, except for fenpropathrin that caused reduction of egg survival at rate of 66 %. The <b>acaricides</b> azocyclotin, diafenthiuron, tetradifon and abamectin caused 100 % of mortality to adult females. Otherwise, diafenthiuron (500 g de a. i. /Kg), fenpyroximate (50 g de a. i. /L), propargite (720 g de a. i. /L) and tetradifon (80 g de a. i. /L) caused lower impact to adult females of E. alatus and, therefore, being of potential recommendation into an integrated pest management...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{parasitology}} {{is facing}} a number of crucial challenges, including the urgent request of effective control tools against arthropod vectors of medical and veterinary importance. Ticks transmit at least the same amount or even more pathogen species {{than any other group}} of blood-feeding arthropods worldwide affecting humans and animals. Besides the development of vaccines against viruses vectored by ticks, integrated pest management practices aimed at reducing tick interactions with livestock, emerging pheromone-based control tools, and few biological control agents have been also proposed. The extensive employ of <b>acaricides</b> and tick repellents still remains the two most effective and ready-to-use strategies. However, the use of synthetic <b>acaricides</b> is limited by the development of resistance in several tick species as well as by heavy environmental concerns. In this scenario, the exploitation of botanicals as cheap and effective sources of tick repellents may represent a valid alternative, and the preservation of ethnobotanical information on the repellent and acaricidal potential of plants is crucial. On the other hand, novel photodynamic <b>acaricides</b> have been recently described, with a toxicity against ticks which far exceed some of the <b>acaricides</b> currently marketed (e. g. tetramethrin). In this brief review, I provide a focus on some hot news in tick control, with special reference to tick repellents of botanical origin and new photodynamic fluorescent <b>acaricides.</b> To my mind, knowledge on both the mentioned research issues may help researchers to build valuable roadmaps to boost tick control programs worldwide...|$|R
