40|$|<b>Antifoam</b> 747 {{is added}} to {{minimize}} foam produced by process gases and water vapor during chemical processing of sludge in the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). This allows DWPF to maximize acid addition and evaporation rates to minimize the cycle time in the Chemical Processing Cell (CPC). Improvements in DWPF melt rate due to the addition of bubblers in the melter {{have resulted in the}} need for further reductions in cycle time in the CPC. This can only be accomplished with an effective <b>antifoam</b> agent. DWPF production was suspended on March 22, 2011 {{as the result of a}} Flammable Gas New Information/(NI) Potential Inadequacy in the Safety Analysis (PISA). The issue was that the DWPF melter offgas flammability strategy did not take into account the H and C in the <b>antifoam,</b> potentially flammable components, in the melter feed. It was also determined the DWPF was using much more <b>antifoam</b> than anticipated due to a combination of longer processing in the CPC due to high Hg, longer processing due to Actinide Removal Process (ARP) /Modular Caustic Side Solvent Extraction Unit (MCU) additions, and adding more <b>antifoam</b> than recommended. The resolution to the PISA involved and assessment of the impact of the <b>antifoam</b> on melter flammability and the implementation of a strategy to control additions within acceptable levels. This led to the need to minimize the use of <b>Antifoam</b> 747 in processing beginning in May 2011. DWPF has had limited success in using <b>Antifoam</b> 747 in caustic processing. Since starting up the ARP facility, the ARP product (similar chemically to caustic sludge) {{is added to}} the Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) at boiling and evaporated to maintain a constant SRAT volume. Although there is very little offgas generated during caustic boiling, there is a large volume of water vapor produced which can lead to foaming. High additions and more frequent use of <b>antifoam</b> are used to mitigate the foaming during caustic boiling. The result of these three issues above is that DWPF had three <b>antifoam</b> needs in FY 2011 : (1) Determine the cause of the poor <b>Antifoam</b> 747 performance during caustic boiling; (2) Determine the decomposition products of <b>Antifoam</b> 747 during CPC processing; and (3) Improve the effectiveness of <b>Antifoam</b> 747, in order to minimize the amount used. Testing was completed by Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) and Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) researchers to address these questions. The testing results reported were funded by both DWPF and DOE/EM 31. Both sets of results are reported in this document for completeness. The results of this research are summarized: (1) The cause for the poor <b>Antifoam</b> 747 performance during caustic boiling was the high hydrolysis rate, cleaving the <b>antifoam</b> molecule in two, leading to poor <b>antifoam</b> performance. In testing with pH solutions from 1 to 13, the <b>antifoam</b> degraded quickly at a pH 10. As the <b>antifoam</b> decomposed it lost its spreading ability (wetting agent performance), which is crucial to its antifoaming performance. During testing of a caustic sludge simulants, there was more foam in tests with added <b>Antifoam</b> 747 than in tests without added <b>antifoam.</b> (2) Analyses were completed to determine the composition of the two <b>antifoam</b> components and <b>Antifoam</b> 747. In addition, the decomposition products of <b>Antifoam</b> 747 were determined during CPC processing of sludge simulants. The main decomposition products were identified primarily as Long Chain Siloxanes, boiling point > 400 C. Total <b>antifoam</b> recovery was 33 % by mass. In a subsequent study, various compounds potentially related to <b>antifoam</b> were found using semi-volatile organic analysis and volatile organic analysis on the hexane extractions and hexane rinses. These included siloxanes, trimethyl silanol, methoxy trimethyl silane, hexamethyl disiloxane, aliphatic hydrocarbons, dioctyl phthalate, and emulsifiers. Cumulatively, these species amounted to less than 3 % of the <b>antifoam</b> mass. The majority of the <b>antifoam</b> was identified using carbon analysis of the SRAT product (40 - 80 % by mass) and silicon analysis (23 - 83 % by mass) of the condensate. Both studies recommended a better solvent for <b>antifoam</b> and more specific tests for <b>antifoam</b> degradation products than the Si and C analyses used. (3) The DWPF <b>Antifoam</b> 747 Purchase Specification was revised in Month, 2011 with a goal of increasing the quality of <b>Antifoam</b> 747. The purchase specification was changed to specify the manufacturer and product for both components that are blended by Siovation to produce <b>Antifoam</b> 747 for DWPF. Testing of <b>Antifoam</b> produced using both the old and new <b>antifoam</b> specifications perform very similarly in testing.

40|$|The River Protection Project-Waste Treatment Plant (RPP-WTP) {{requested}} Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) {{to conduct}} small-scale foaming and <b>antifoam</b> testing using a Hanford waste simulant subjected to air sparging during oxidative leaching. The foaminess of Hanford tank waste solutions was previously demonstrated by SRNL during WTP evaporator foaming studies and in small scale air sparger studies. The commercial <b>antifoam,</b> Dow Corning Q 2 - 3183 A was recommended {{to mitigate the}} foam in the evaporators and in vessel equipped with pulse jet mixers and air spargers. Currently, WTP is planning to use air spargers in the HLW Lag Storage Vessels (HLP-VSL- 00027 A/B), the Ultrafiltration Vessels (UFP-VSL- 00002 A&B), and the HLW Feed Blend Vessel (HLPVSL- 00028) to assist {{the performance of the}} Pulse Jet Mixers (PJM).

40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) at the Savannah River Site is {{responsible}} for immobilizing high level radioactive waste (HLW) as glass-filled steel canisters for permanent storage. In the DWPF facility, the HLW sludge undergoes chemical treatment to prepare it for vitrification in a melter. The generation of stable foams is possible during treatment. The current DWPF <b>antifoam</b> is ineffective in preventing and minimizing the formation of foam. The adverse consequences of excess foam can be severe enough to cause foam to exit the evaporator and collect in the condensate. A foamover will contaminate the relatively clean condensate with HLW solids. It can also potentially lead {{to the production of}} an unsuitable melter feed that would not make quality glass. Both of these consequences are costly and time consuming to correct. A new <b>antifoam</b> agent was developed by the Illinois Institute of Technology, IIT, for DWPF in an attempt to minimize or eliminate the frequency of these foamovers.

It {{consists}} mostly of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polypropylene glycol (PPG). These and other minor constituents of the <b>antifoam</b> have organic constituents that may participate in radiolytic and chemical reactions that produce hydrogen in Hanford waste. It has been recommended by The WTP R&T Department recommended personnel to treat the organic compounds of the <b>antifoam</b> like the in a similar manner as other organic compounds that are native to the Hanford waste with respect to hydrogen production. This testing has investigated the radiolytic and thermal production of hydrogen from <b>antifoam</b> added to simulant waste solutions to determine if the organic components of the <b>antifoam</b> produce hydrogen {{in the same manner as}} the native organic species in Hanford waste. <b>Antifoam</b> additions for this testing were in the range of 4 to 10 wt% to ensure adequate hydrogen detection. Test conditions were selected to bound exposures to the <b>antifoam</b> agent in the WTP. These levels are higher than previously recommended values of 350 mg/L for actual applications in WTP tanks containing air spargers and pulse jet mixers. Limited degradation analyses for the organic components of the <b>antifoam</b> were investigated in this study. A more detailed study involving analyses of <b>antifoam</b> degradation and product formation is in progress at SRNL and results from that study will be reported at a later time. The total organic carbon (TOC) content of the Q 2 - 3183 A <b>antifoam</b> was measured to be 39. 7 {+-} 4. 9 wt% TOC. This measurement was performed in triplicate with on three different dilutions of the pure <b>antifoam</b> liquid using a TOC combustion analyzer instrument with catalytic oxidation, followed by CO{sub 2 } quantification using an infrared detector. Test results from this study indicate that the WTP HGR correlation conservatively bounds hydrogen generation rates (HGRs) from antifoam-containing simulants if the <b>antifoam</b> organic components are treated the same as other native organics. Tests that used the combination of radiolysis and thermolysis conducted on simulants containing <b>antifoam</b> produced measured hydrogen that was bounded by the WTP correlation. These tests used the bounding WTP temperature of 90 C and a dose rate of 1. 8 x 10 {sup 5 } rad/hr. This dose rate is about ten times higher than the dose rate equivalent calculated for a bounding Hanford sludge slurry composition of 10 Ci/L, or 2 x 10 {sup 4 } rad/hr. Hydrogen was measured using a quadrupole mass spectroscopy instrument. Based on the analyses from the 4 wt% and 10 wt% <b>antifoam</b> samples, it is expected that the HGR results are directly proportional to the <b>antifoam</b> concentration added. A native organic-containing simulant that did not contain any added <b>antifoam</b> also produced a measurable radiolytic/thermal hydrogen rates that was in bounded by the WTP correlation. A base simulant with no added organic produced a measurable radiolytic/thermal HGR that was {approx} 2 X higher than the predicted HGR. Analysis of antifoam-containing simulants after prolonged irradiation of 52 Mrad and heating (23 days at 90 C) indicates that essentially all of the PDMS and greater than 60 % of the PPG components are degraded, likely to lower molecular weight species. The <b>antifoam</b> components were analyzed by extraction from the salt simulants, followed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) by personnel at Dow Corning.

Intriguingly, antifoams are often added without prior consideration of their effect on the yeast cells, the protein product or the influence on downstream processes such as protein purification. In this study we characterised, for the first time, the effects of five commonly-used antifoaming agents on the total amount of recombinant green fluorescent protein (GFP) secreted from shake-flask cultures of this industrially-relevant yeast. Results Addition of defined concentrations of <b>Antifoam</b> A (Sigma), <b>Antifoam</b> C (Sigma), J 673 A (Struktol), P 2000 (Fluka) or SB 2121 (Struktol) to shake-flask cultures of P. pastoris increased the total amount of recombinant GFP in the culture medium (the total yield) {{and in the case of}} P 2000, SB 2121 and J 673 A almost doubled it. When normalized to the culture density, the GFP specific yield (μg OD 595 - 1) was only increased for <b>Antifoam</b> A, <b>Antifoam</b> C and J 673 A. Whilst none of the antifoams affected the growth rate of the cells, addition of P 2000 or SB 2121 was found to increase culture density. There was no correlation between total yield, specific yield or specific growth rate and the volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient (k L a) in the presence of <b>antifoam.</b> Moreover, the antifoams did not affect the dissolved oxygen concentration of the cultures. A comparison of the amount of GFP retained in the cell by flow cytometry with that in the culture medium by fluorimetry suggested that addition of <b>Antifoam</b> A, <b>Antifoam</b> C or J 673 A increased the specific yield of GFP by increasing the proportion secreted into the medium.
