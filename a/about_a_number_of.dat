25|$|One of {{the reasons}} the works of Josephus were copied and {{maintained}} by Christians was that his writings provided a good deal of information <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> figures mentioned in the New Testament, and the background to events such as the death of James during a gap in Roman governing authority. Because manuscript transmission was done by hand-copying, typically by monastic scribes, almost all ancient texts have been subject to both accidental and deliberate alterations, emendations (called interpolation) or elisions. Both the lack of any original corroborating manuscript source outside the Christian tradition as well as the practice of Christian interpolation has led to the scholarly debate regarding the authenticity of Josephus' references to Jesus in his work. Although {{there is no doubt that}} most (but not all) of the later copies of the Antiquities contained references to Jesus and John the Baptist, it cannot be definitively shown that these were original to Josephus writings. Much of the scholarly work concerning the references to Jesus in Josephus has concentrated on close textual analysis of the Josephan corpus to determine the degree to which the language, as preserved in both early Christian quotations and the later transmissions, should be considered authentic. However, based on the general expectation of what Josephus would have written on Jesus and the actual statements made by Origen and Jerome, the version used by Michael the Syrian and Agapius (see below, Arabic and Syriac Josephus), the neutral reconstruction of the text has a reasonable probability of being what Josephus actually wrote as they would have had access to earlier copies of the Testimonium.|$|E

[...] He alleged that King explained his extramarital affairs as [...] "a form of anxiety reduction." [...] Garrow asserted that King's supposed promiscuity caused him [...] "painful and at times overwhelming guilt." [...] King's wife Coretta appeared to have accepted his affairs with equanimity, saying once that [...] "all that other business just doesn't have a place in the very high level relationship we enjoyed." [...] Shortly after Bearing the Cross was released, civil rights author Howell Raines gave the book a positive review but opined that Garrow's allegations about King's sex life were [...] "sensational" [...] and stated that Garrow was [...] "amassing facts rather than analyzing them." ...|$|E
500|$|Longacre {{completed}} the lower-relief dies about January 12, 1850. [...] Peale did not test them for two weeks; when he did, he rejected them, stating that Liberty's head opposed the eagle on the reverse, {{making it difficult}} for the full design to be brought forth. [...] He stated that Longacre would have to move the position of the head. [...] Longacre, outraged, appealed to Director Patterson, who took no action, but early the next month came to see Longacre in his office. [...] He told the engraver that the Taylor administration (which had taken office in March 1849) had decided on Longacre's removal, and urged him to send in his resignation as quickly as possible. [...] Longacre did not resign, but went to Washington to see Secretary Meredith. [...] He found that Patterson had lied to Meredith <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> matters. [...] For example, when Longacre took a new double eagle from his pocket, Meredith expressed surprise, believing that the dies from which it had been made had been broken.

500|$|... "Why Does This Always Happen To Me?" [...] emulates {{the style}} of Ben Folds. According to music critic Nathan Rabin, the song [...] "amplifies the noxious {{self-absorption}} of the American character to hilarious extremes" [...] by describing a narrator who, upon hearing <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> horrible tragedies, only complains about the (minor) inconveniences that affect him. [...] Folds himself plays piano on the track. Yankovic later told The A.V. Club: [...] "Ben and I are old friends at this point, and of course I sought his keyboard work for that song. So {{he came in and}} knocked it out. I think that’s an F-Sharp, so he was kind of mad at me for that." [...] "Bob" [...] is a style parody of Bob Dylan, composed entirely of palindromes (for instance, the song's first line is [...] "I, man, am regal—a German am I", which reads the same when reversed). Rabin argues that the song's lyrics [...] "sound cryptic enough to be genuine Dylanesque, but are in fact palindromes deliver in an uncanny re-creation of Dylan's nasal whine." [...] The album's closer, [...] "Genius in France", emulates the idiosyncratic style of Frank Zappa. Zappa's son, Dweezil performed the song's intro guitar solo. Lyrically, the song describes a person who, although rejected elsewhere, finds acceptance in France.|$|E
500|$|When Longacre {{completed}} the double eagle dies, they were rejected by Peale, who {{stated that the}} design was engraved too deeply to fully impress the coin, and the pieces would not stack properly. [...] Taxay, however, noted that the one surviving 1849 double eagle displays no such problems, and by appearance would be level in a stack. Peale complained to Patterson, who wrote to Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith asking for Longacre's removal on December 25, 1849 on the ground he could not make proper dies. [...] Patterson that day promised the position to engraver Charles Cushing Wright, effective when Longacre was ousted. [...] Meredith questioned whether a competent replacement could be found; Patterson assured him that one could. [...] Longacre objected to Patterson that Peale was delaying acceptance of revised double eagle dies, the director did not reply in writing, but met with Longacre, told him the administration had decided to terminate him, {{and that he should}} send in his resignation without delay. [...] Longacre, after thinking the matter over, did not do so, but instead went to Washington on February 12, 1850 to meet with Meredith. [...] He found that the secretary had been lied to <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> matters. [...] According to Snow, Longacre did not seek retribution, content to be allowed to continue his work in peace. [...] The double eagle went into production in March 1850, though Patterson complained that the coins did not strike well. [...] The double eagle quickly became the favored way [...] to hold gold, and {{in the years to come}} more gold would be struck into double eagles than into all other denominations combined.|$|E
