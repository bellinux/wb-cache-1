40|$|Abstract Authors:Stefan Harrå and Magnus Björk Advisor: Markku Penttinen Title: Accounting Consequences of {{the change}} in pension {{accounting}} Background to problem: When the revised IAS 19 comes into force January 1, 2013, it means that two of the three accounting principles for defined benefit pension plans are disappearing, including the corridor method. The corridor method has made it possible for companies to defer its actuarial gains and losses. Now that the corridor approach abolished then the unrecognized actuarial gains and losses immediately be covered by equity, which involves very large amounts of some companies. Why the amounts have grown so big is much because of the discount rate. The discount rate is a controversial parameter, and there is disagreement on how it should be fixed. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to examine the accounting implications this will have for the company applied the corridor method, and if there is some parameters in the <b>actuarial</b> <b>assumption</b> that is more important than others. Methodology: The thesis has mainly been based on a qualitative research through qualitative interviews with a small sample that is affected by this change. There are quantitative elements to a greater depth by examining the annual reports, discount and deferred pension liabilities of the various companies. The approach is exploratory as it is a qualitative study and there was little knowledge of the subject before the work of it started. Therefore, a study of literature, regulations and previous research before the empirical study. This made it possible to gain a broader understanding of the subject and to shape relevant and essential interview questions. Conclusions: The conclusion shows that the largest accounting consequences for the companies in the study in conjunction with the change is that the unrecognized actuarial gains and losses will now be covered by equity and that the expected return on plan assets is based on the discount rate. The study also shows that it is the discount rate which is considered the most important parameter that the companies are looking at in the <b>actuarial</b> <b>assumption.</b> The conclusion also provides a shared sense of the true and fair picture of the companies after the revised IAS 19. Suggestions for further research: That after 2013 to study how the actual result of this rule change did this compare to the expected. Look at the problem of determining the discount rate. How will the IASB look at it if more and more begin to deviate from the standard?

The claim reserve estimates calculated with the Chain-ladder method are compared to the estimates produced with GLM method. For the GLM model selection residuals, AIC/BIC and deviance are used. Also the parameter estimate significance is checked. Validation data is used to compare the realized claim payment estimates to the estimates produced by the 2 models. Equal accuracy of the reserve estimates can be achieved with both selected methods when equal amount of data information is used. In the GLM reserve estimation adding more information of claim behavior is easier than with in traditional actuarial methods. The GLM estimated reserves converges closer to the reality when more claim information is added to the model. Thus the accuracy of estimates improves. Adding available claim information into GLM reserve modelling can be used to provide alternative reserve estimates and to improve the accuracy of the claim reserve estimates...|$|R

40|$|Summary: A {{controversial}} {{alternative to}} ERISA/FASB actuarial cost methods and assumptions {{is presented as}} a challenge from the discipline of financial economics. 1. It is argued that economic assumptions prescribed by ERISA and the FASB are financially biased in a fashion that favors equity investments. This is detrimental to shareholders, risky to the PBGC, and of ambiguous benefit to plan participants. A comparison is made between existing methods/assumptions and alternatives that are, in the language of finance, "transparent. " FASB's current "fair value " paradigm follows the transparent financial model. 2. The combination of transparent actuarial cost methods, unbiased <b>actuarial</b> economic <b>assumptions</b> and the Internal Revenue Code Imply that, in the future, U. S. -defined benefit plans will be invested entirely in fixed income. This will reduce the risk exposure of the PBGC, provide tax benefits to shareholders, and provide participants with a more certain measure of their benefit security. MR. KRA: Welcome to Session 37.

40|$|Motivated by {{the recent}} 2007 / 2008 Financial Crisis, this {{dissertation}} identifies endogenous risk in the German insurance sector during the Interwar sector. In the context of principal agent theory, endogenous risk {{is the result of}} a company reacting to shocks that are generated and amplified within the financial system by shifting risk from shareholders to policyholders. This dissertation provides analytical support for this interdependence on the basis of established financial as well as <b>actuarial</b> models and <b>assumptions.</b> The empirical analysis considers the German insurance sector during the Interwar period due to the presence of a pronounced business cycle, the absence of exogenous low-probability high-cost events, a consistent regulatory framework as well as available quantitative data. The econometric analysis is based on four newly compiled datasets that collect the 1924 gold account opening balances, company- as well as line-specific financial information, and stock price quotations for all publicly traded German insurance companies during the Interwar period. The dissertation finds that during the Interwar period in the German insurance sector (Ch. 2), the risk of getting discontinued prior to default (3) led companies to cater dividend payout (Ch. 4) and reinsurance operations (Ch. 5) to an optimistic investor clientele (Ch. 6), yet in contrast to the underwriting cycle (Ch. 7) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{paradigm}} shift in the valuation of long term annuities, away from classical no-arbitrage valuation towards valuation under the real world probability measure. Furthermore, we apply this valuation method to two examples of annuity products, one having annual payments linked to a mortality index and the savings account and the other having annual payments linked to a mortality index and an equity index with a guarantee that {{is linked to the}} same mortality index and the savings account. Out-of-sample hedge simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of real world valuation. In contrast to risk neutral valuation, which is a form of relative valuation, the long term average excess return of the equity market comes into play. Instead of the savings account, the numéraire portfolio is employed as the fundamental unit of value in the analysis. The numéraire portfolio is the strictly positive, tradable portfolio that when used as benchmark makes all benchmarked nonnegative portfolios supermartingales. The benchmarked real world value of a benchmarked contingent claim equals its real world conditional expectation. This yields the minimal possible value for its hedgeable part and minimizes the fluctuations for its benchmarked hedge error. Under classical <b>assumptions,</b> <b>actuarial</b> and risk neutral valuation emerge as special cases of the proposed real world valuation. In long term liability and asset valuation, the proposed real world valuation can lead to significantly lower values than suggested by classical approaches when an equivalent risk neutral probability measure does not exist.

50|$|Although a {{cash balance}} plan is {{technically}} a defined benefit plan {{designed to allow}} workers to evaluate the economic worth their pension benefit {{in the manner of}} a defined contribution plan (i.e., as an account balance), the target benefit plan is a defined contribution plan designed to express its projected impact in terms of lifetime income as a percent of final salary at retirement (i.e., as an annuity amount).

In {{long-term}} care (LTC) insurance, three main <b>actuarial</b> <b>assumptions</b> are incidence, termination and utilization rates. These assumptions {{can be seen as}} factors affecting the financial progress in LTC insurance business. Insurance companies must make sure the assumptions they use adequately reflect actual experience to avoid adverse financial consequences. Hence, a regular systematic methodology to monitor expected assumptions is essential. This work proposes a methodology to adjusting expected assumptions of LTC incidence rates. The methodology uses a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) approach in modeling incidence rates and the adjustment is parallel to an established industry technique of stochastic deferred acquisition cost (DAC) unlocking. The methodology uses confidence intervals as a decision tool to decide if any adjustment is needed. We also bring in a credibility component into the methodology to provide rationalization for choosing the appropriate significant level of the confidence interval when applying the methodology. Lastly we study the effect of size of historical experience used in the adjustment on the efficiency of the methodology. Similar to how the stochastic DAC unlocking technique is an acceptable technique by regulators and practitioners, we foresee our GLM methodology to be accepted as a basis for adjusting assumptions under Principle-Based Reserving in the future...|$|E

A sample of 20 of the listed FTSE 100 companies, between 2005 and 2006, was taken to explore the quality of pension disclosures. This study makes original and unique contribution by comparing the sample disclosure scores with the benchmark, Generico, to enable the quality of disclosures to be explored.
