5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Roman Empire, Barbarians plundered the region around Klis. First it was ruled by Odoacer, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Theodoric the Great, after he {{eliminated}} Odoacer, and set up an Ostrogothic Kingdom. After Justinian I fought an almost continual war for forty years to recover the old Roman Empire, he seized Dalmatia, and Klis was from 537, a part of Byzantine Empire. The name of Klis (Kleisa or Kleisoura) was first described in chapter 29 of Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus' De Administrando Imperio. While describing the Roman settlement of Salona, Constantine VII speaks of the stronghold, which may have been designed or improved, to prevent attacks on the coastal cities and roads by Slavs.|$|E
5|$|Burges {{bought the}} lease on {{the plot of}} land in 1875. The house was built by the Ashby Brothers, with {{interior}} decoration by members of Burges's long-standing team of craftsmen including Thomas Nicholls and Henry Stacy Marks. By 1878 the house was largely complete, although interior decoration and the designing of numerous items of furniture and metalwork continued until Burges's death in 1881. The house was inherited by his brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan. It was later sold to Colonel T.H. Minshall and then, in 1933, to Colonel E.R.B. Graham. The poet John Betjeman inherited the remaining lease in 1962 but did not extend it. Following a period when the house stood empty and suffered vandalism, it was purchased and restored, first by Lady Jane Turnbull, later by the actor Richard Harris <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> musician Jimmy Page.|$|E
5|$|By July 1943, the 7th Division {{was on its}} {{way back}} to Port Moresby. Vasey flew up to work out {{arrangements}} with Herring and the air commander in New Guinea, Major General Ennis Whitehead of the US Fifth Air Force. Probably inspired by his experience on Crete, Vasey proposed using paratroops, and pressed his superiors for an entire regiment instead of the battalion he was originally allotted. The new campaign opened in spectacular fashion on 5 September 1943 with a parachute drop of the US 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment in broad daylight to seize the airstrip at Nadzab in the Markham Valley. They were soon reinforced by Australian and Papuan troops that had advanced overland from Wau, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 7th Division's 25th Infantry Brigade, which flew in by air.|$|E

5|$|Dazzle {{was adopted}} by the Admiralty in the UK, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> United States Navy, with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships {{instantly}} recognisable to the enemy. The result was that a profusion of dazzle schemes was tried, and the evidence for their success was at best mixed. So many factors were involved {{that it was impossible to}} determine which were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective.|$|E
5|$|Lefkada, {{part of the}} Despotate of Epirus {{since the}} latter's {{foundation}} in 1205, was incorporated by Leonardo I Tocco into the County of Cephalonia in 1362. The Despotate of Epirus {{was one of the}} three Byzantine Empires in exile created after the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Following the fate of the other central Ionian Islands, it was captured by the Turks in 1479 <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Venetians in 1502. However, Venetian rule did not last, as Lefkada was given back to the Ottoman Empire one year later. Turkish rule over Lefkada lasted for over 200 years, from 1479 to 1684, when Francesco Morosini attacked and subdued the island during the Morean War. Lefkada, however, did not become officially Venetian until 1718, with the signature of the Treaty of Passarowitz.|$|E
5|$|Newton's parakeet {{was first}} {{recorded}} by François Leguat in his 1708 memoir A New Voyage to the East Indies. Leguat {{was the leader}} of a group of nine French Huguenot refugees who colonised Rodrigues between 1691 and 1693 after they were marooned there. Subsequent accounts were by Julien Tafforet, who was marooned on the island in 1726, in his Relation de l'Île Rodrigue, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> French mathematician Alexandre Pingré, who travelled to Rodrigues to view the 1761 transit of Venus.|$|E

5|$|The artist's {{reputation}} {{was such that}} {{he had already been}} called to Rome a number of times in the early 1540s; first by Cardinal Pietro Bembo <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Farnese family. By the mid-1540s Titian was the preferred portraitist for the Farnese. Following a number of earlier portraits of Pier Luigi and Paul, they commissioned a set to mark their ascendancy after Paul's papacy, all of which were– given their political awareness and ambition– clearly intended as public statements on their social elevation. Paul was aware of Titian's influence in Venice, and after 1538 allowed only Titian to portray him.|$|E
5|$|The concerto is {{innovative}} in many respects. In {{the first}} movement alone, Mendelssohn departs from the typical {{form of a}} Classical concerto in many ways, the most immediate being the entry of the soloist almost from the outset, which also occurs in his First Piano Concerto. Although the first movement is mostly in the conventional sonata form, Mendelssohn has the first theme played by the solo violin <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> orchestra. Classical concertos typically opened with an orchestral introduction followed by a version of essentially the same material that incorporates the soloist.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the {{migration}} and evolution {{of the practice of}} circumcision is followed mainly through the cultures and peoples in two separate regions. In the lands south and east of the Mediterranean, starting with Sudan and Ethiopia, the procedure was practiced by the ancient Egyptians and the Semites, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Jews and Muslims, with whom the practice travelled to and was adopted by the Bantu Africans. In Oceania, circumcision is practiced by the Australian Aborigines and Polynesians. There is also evidence that circumcision was practiced among the Aztec and Mayan civilizations in the Americas, but little detail is available about its history.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{a museum}} {{dedicated}} {{to the work of}} Hergé {{can be traced back to}} the end of the 1970s, when Hergé was still alive. After his death in 1983, Hergé's widow, Fanny, led the efforts, undertaken at first by the Hergé Foundation <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> new Studios Hergé, to catalogue and choose the artwork and elements that would become part of the Museum's exhibitions.|$|E
5|$|The {{second and}} third waves of castle {{building}} were led by the major magnates, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> more junior knights on their new estates. The apportionment of the conquered lands by the king influenced where these castles were built. In a few key locations the king gave his followers compact groups of estates including the six rapes of Sussex and the three earldoms of Chester, Shrewsbury and Hereford; intended to protect the line of communication with Normandy and the Welsh border respectively. In these areas a baron's castles were clustered relatively tightly together, but in most of England the nobles' estates, and therefore their castles, were more widely dispersed. As the Normans pushed on into South Wales they advanced up the valleys building castles as they went and often using the larger castles of the neighbouring earldoms as a base.|$|E

5|$|The {{victory at}} Salamis {{was used by}} Antigonus as a {{suitable}} pretext for his own royal proclamation, the Macedonian throne having lain vacant since the murder of Alexander IV of Macedon by Cassander in 309 BC. At the same time, Demetrius was raised to co-king alongside his father. Antigonus' assumption of the royal title was followed by an attempt to eliminate Ptolemy for good in a massive, but failed, invasion of Egypt in autumn 306, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> celebrated, but equally unsuccessful, Siege of Rhodes by Demetrius in 305–304 BC. Finally, in 302 BC the remaining dynasts—Ptolemy, Cassander, Seleucus, and Lysimachus—having in turn assumed the royal title themselves, allied against Antigonus and defeated him in the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC. Antigonus was killed, and his realm was broken up and divided among the victors.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Lee Flanagan (March 16, 1930– November 16, 2001) was an American jazz {{pianist and}} composer. He {{grew up in}} Detroit, {{initially}} influenced by such pianists as Art Tatum, Teddy Wilson, and Nat King Cole, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> newer bebop musicians. Within months of moving to New York in 1956, he had recorded with Miles Davis and on Sonny Rollins' landmark Saxophone Colossus. Recordings under various leaders, including the historically important Giant Steps of John Coltrane, and The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery, continued well into 1962, when he became vocalist Ella Fitzgerald's full-time accompanist. He worked with Fitzgerald for three years until 1965, and then in 1968 returned to be her pianist and musical director, this time for a decade.|$|E
5|$|With the ephors vanquished, Cleomenes {{initiated}} his reforms.

He divided {{up all of the}} Spartan land, awarding an equal lot to each citizen. He increased the citizen population by granting citizenship to some perioeci, who constituted the Spartan middle class, but did not at that time have Spartan citizenship. Expanding the citizen population meant that Cleomenes could build a larger army; he trained 4,000 hoplites and restored the old Spartan social and military discipline. He also strengthened his army by introducing the Macedonian sarissa (pike). Cleomenes completed his reforms by placing his brother, Eucleidas, in charge, making him the first Agiad king on the Eurypontid throne.|$|E
