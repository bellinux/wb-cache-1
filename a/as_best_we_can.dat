(2005, {{hereafter}} MRWA 05) {{examined the}} performance of the Regularized Expectation Maximization (RegEM) climate field reconstruction (CFR) technique, which has been favored in recent proxybased climate reconstruction by Mann and coworkers (Mann and Rutherford 2002; Rutherford et al. 2003, 2005; MRWA 05; Zhang and Mann 2005). MRWA 05 demonstrated that the method yields skillful reconstructions using synthetic proxy (“pseudoproxy”) datasets with similar attributes to actual proxy networks, derived from a simulation of the past millennium using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Climate System Model version 1. 4 (CSM 1. 4) coupled model. They consequently concluded that surface temperature reconstructions resulting from the application of this method to actual proxy data (e. g., Rutherford et al. 2005) are likely to yield realistic reconstructions within estimated uncertainties. Zorita et al.

40|$|Although {{it seems}} that end stage renal disease (ESRD) therapies {{gradually}} become more accessible in the developing world, yet, {{the vast majority of}} people living in those areas do not have access to dialysis and especially transplantation because of the economic and technological inequality as compared with the developed world. Despite the great advantage in survival and considerable socioeconomic advantages of transplantation vs. dialysis, there is a widespread recognition that the growing gap between organ supply and demand will continue into the foreseeable future. Several reasons might be considered in this regard as: insufficient data on the topic in the public domain, inadequate governmental financial resources, lack of public awareness, education and motivation for organ donation as well as the low number of organized teams of transplant surgeons and nephrologists, and lack of organizational infrastructure, i. e. coordinators. The defined priorities for the future in terms of improving living donor transplantation, composition of the official waiting lists and registries of transplant recipients and living donors and the role of transplant professionals have been discussed.
