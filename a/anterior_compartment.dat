25|$|The biceps is {{a muscle}} {{in the upper}} arm with two heads, called the short head and the long head, which {{converge}} into a single mass. It {{is one of the}} three muscles in the <b>anterior</b> <b>compartment</b> of the arm, the others being the brachialis muscle and the coracobrachialis muscle, with which the biceps shares a nerve supply. Both heads of the biceps arise from the scapula in the shoulder, and the muscle attaches to the radius (bone), in the forearm. Specifically, the short head of the biceps originates from the coracoid process {{at the top of the}} scapula. The long head originates from the supraglenoid tubercle just above the shoulder joint. From here, the long head has a tendon that passes up along the intertubercular groove of the humerus into the joint capsule of the shoulder joint. The tendon of the short head runs adjacent to the tendon of the coracobrachialis and likewise attaches to the coracoid process.|$|E

In this study, a unilateral variation of the brachial nerve plexus, which {{is characterized by the}} absent of the musculocutaneous nerve (MCN), was found in the right arm of a male cadaver. The MCN normally originates from the lateral cord of the brachial nerve plexus and innervates the <b>anterior</b> brachial <b>compartment</b> muscles and lateral coetaneous of the forearm. In this case, the lateral cord of the brachial plexus was joined to the median nerve at the level of coracoid process with no evidence of any nerve braches from lateral cord to the <b>anterior</b> brachial <b>compartment</b> muscles. These muscles were innervated from some branches of median nerve directly...|$|R

Arthroscopic arthrolysis is the treatment of choice for numerous conditions (stiffness subsequent to inflammatory processes, stiffness associated with marked osteoporosis, etc.) in which open arthrolysis is contraindicated. The totally atraumatic nature of arthroscopy and the more accurate lysis of the adhesions allow for postoperative management without complications or pain. This is of particular importance as it permits passive and active kinesitherapy {{from the moment the}} patient recovers from anaesthesia, without pain and therefore with greater commitment on his part.

40|$|Although most {{mutations}} at the engrailed {{locus of}} Drosophila cause embryonic death when homozygous, they are viable in clones of cells. We describe the phenotype of such clones in the eye-antenna, proboscis, humerus, wing, legs, and terminalia. When in <b>anterior</b> <b>compartments</b> the clones are normal, {{but in most}} posterior compartments they are abnormal and fail to respect the anteroposterior compartment boundary. We find that the yield of engrailed-lethal clones in posterior compartments is often significantly lower than expected, indicating that these clones are lost during development. Mutant clones are abnormal in the analia and rare in the humerus, suggesting that both structures are of posterior provenance.

40|$|Segments are {{fundamental}} units in animal development {{which are made}} of distinct cell lineages separated by boundaries. Although boundaries show limited plasticity during their formation for sharpening, cell lineages make compartments that become tightly restricted as development goes on. Here, we characterize a unique case of breaking of the segment boundary in late drosophila embryos. During dorsal closure, specific cells from <b>anterior</b> <b>compartments</b> cross the segment boundary and enter the adjacent posterior compartments. This cell mixing behaviour is driven by an anterior-to-posterior reprogramming mechanism involving de novo expression of the homeodomain protein Engrailed. Mixing is accompanied by stereotyped local cell intercalation, converting the segment boundary into a relaxation compartment important for tension-release during morphogenesis. This process of lineage switching and cell remodelling is controlled by JNK signalling. Our results reveal plasticity of segment boundaries during late morphogenesis and a role for JNK-dependen...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: MRI {{characterization}} of dysferlinopathy has been mostly {{limited to the}} lower limbs. We aimed to broaden the MRI description of dysferlinopathy and to correlate it with objective measures of motor dysfunction. Methods: Sequential whole-body axial MRI was performed in 27 patients with genetically confirmed dysferlinopathy classified according to disease duration. Spearman correlations of fatty infiltration scores versus Motor Function Measure (MFM) were calculated. Results: Significant fatty infiltration was symmetrically present in early stages mainly in the posterior compartments of legs and thighs, thigh adductors, pelvic girdle, and some paravertebral muscles and the subscapularis. Later, fatty infiltration involved leg and thigh <b>anterior</b> <b>compartments,</b> arms and forearms, paravertebral, and trunk muscles. MRI infiltration score correlated positively with disease duration and negatively with MFM scale. Conclusions: We expand MRI {{characterization of}} dysferlinopathy and provide evidence for use of MRI scoring combined with motor functional scales to assess the natural course of disease...|$|R
