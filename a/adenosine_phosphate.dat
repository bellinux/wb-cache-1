50|$|Aside of aspirin, three {{antiplatelet}} agents {{taken by}} mouth {{have been approved}} for use in acute coronary syndromes, clopidogrel, ticagrelor and prasugrel; all reduce platelet aggregation by inhibiting the P2Y12 receptor, a type of <b>adenosine</b> <b>phosphate</b> receptor, on platelet surface. Not {{all three of them}} are equally indicated in all types of acute coronary syndromes. In patients with ST elevation the choice of P2Y12 inhibitor depends on reperfusion strategy; for patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention ticagrelor and prasugrel are considered superior to clopidogrel, as they are more potent and have more rapid onset of action, at the cost of some increase in bleeding risk; for STEMI patients who are treated with fibrinolysis {{and those who do not}} undergo reperfusion treatment only clopidogrel is indicated. Prasugrel must not be given to patients with a history of ischemic stroke or aged 75 years or older. In patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome current guidelines also recommend immediate administration of dual antiplatelet therapy upon diagnosis; clopidogrel and ticagrelor are indicated in this setting, with ticagrelor considered superior for patients undergoing early invasive strategy (see later). However, emerging evidence questions this strategy. As with aspirin, it is necessary to administer a loading dose.|$|E

Adenylate energy charges were 0. 44 and 0. 26, respectively. After stratification, total <b>adenosine</b> <b>phosphates</b> {{increased}} 7 -fold and 6 -fold in embryo and gametophyte, respectively, and energy charges rose to 0. 85 and 0. 75.

In embryo and seedling, total <b>adenosine</b> <b>phosphates</b> elevated 80 -fold with two distinct oscillating increases of AMP and ADP. The oscillating increases occurred before the emergence of radicle and cotyledons during which the highest mitotic index prevailed in all tissues. Energy charges fluctuated between 0. 65 at the rapid cell dividing stage to 0. 85 at the fully differentiated stage of the seedling, while energy charges remained around 0. 75 in the gametophyte.

Direct channeling of <b>adenosine</b> <b>phosphates</b> between organelles {{identified in the}} experiments indicates that diffusion of <b>adenosine</b> <b>phosphates</b> is limited in cardiac cells due to very specific intracellular structural organization. However, the mode of diffusion restrictions {{and nature of the}} intracellular structures in creating the diffusion barriers is still unclear, and, therefore, a subject of active research. The aim of this work is to analyze the possible role of two principally different modes of restriction distribution for <b>adenosine</b> <b>phosphates</b> (a) the uniform diffusion restriction and (b) the localized diffusion limitation in the vicinity of mitochondria, by fitting the experimental data with the mathematical model. The reaction-diffusion model of compartmentalized energy transfer was used to analyze the data obtained from the experiments with the skinned muscle fibers, which described the following processes: mitochondrial respiration rate dependency on exogenous ADP and ATP concentrations; inhibition of endogenous ADP-stimulated respiration by pyruvate kinase (PK) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) system; kinetics of oxygen consumption stabilization after addition of 2 mM MgATP or MgADP; ATPase activity with inhibited mitochondrial respiration; and buildup of MgADP concentration in the medium after addition of MgATP. The analysis revealed that only the second mechanism considered [...] localization of diffusion restrictions [...] is able to account for the experimental data. In the case of uniform diffusion restrictions, the model solution was in agreement only with two measurements: the respiration rate as a function of ADP or ATP concentrations and inhibition of respiration by PK + PEP.

40|$|Auxin acts synergistically with {{cytokinin}} {{to control}} the shoot stem-cell niche, while both hormones act antagonistically to maintain the root meristem. In aluminum (Al) stress-induced root growth inhibition, auxin plays an important role. However, the role of cytokinin in this process is not well understood. In this study, we show that cytokinin enhances root growth inhibition under stress by mediating Al-induced auxin signaling. Al stress triggers a local cytokinin response in the root-apex transition zone (TZ) that depends on IPTs, which encode <b>adenosine</b> <b>phosphate</b> isopentenyl-transferases and regulate cytokinin biosynthesis. IPTs are up-regulated specifically in the root-apex TZ in response to Al stress and promote local cytokinin biosynthesis and inhibition of root growth.

Subgrouping according to oocyte recovery and fertilization revealed differences in correlation between the purine metabolites: Only where an oocyte was recovered and subsequently fertilized did follicular fluid adenosine, adenine, and hypoxanthine levels correlate with each other. Significantly, purines' correlation with levels of the terminal degradation product, uric acid, could only be seen in failed fertilization samples. Given the established metabolic pathways for adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate/adenosine monophosphate degradation, the results indicate maximization of 2 purine salvage pathways (from adenine and hypoxanthine) that pivot on the presence of high adenosine levels.

Nicotinamide nucleotide-dependent dehydrogenases were used as models to test this methodology. Elution from these columns by NAD+ and/or AMP gradients (in the presence or the absence of substrates and/or nicotinamide mononucleotide) was consistent with: (1) the compulsory ordered addition of substrates to lactate and malate dehydrogenase; (2) the necessity for the NMN moiety of NAD+ to bind to these enzymes before the substrate; and illustrated: (3) that the binding of these two hydrogenases to these columns compared very well with the published three-dimensional models for these enzymes and (4) that separation of mixtures of dehydrogenases depended on the choice of matrix and displacing ion and whether any additions (e. g. substrates) {{were made to the}} gradients used.

Here, we investigated the impact of increased ATP hydrolysis and NADH oxidation rates on the metabolism of Pseudomonas putida KT 2440 by titration of 2, 4 -dinitrophenol (DNP) and overproduction of a water-forming NADH oxidase, respectively. Both perturbations resulted in a reduction of the biomass yield and, as a consequence of the uncoupling of catabolic and anabolic activities, in an amplification of the net NADH regeneration rate. However, a stimulation of the specific carbon uptake rate was observed only when P. putida was challenged with very high 2, 4 -dinitrophenol concentrations and was comparatively unaffected by recombinant NADH oxidase activity. This behavior contrasts with the comparably sensitive performance described, for example, for Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The apparent robustness of P. putida metabolism indicates that it possesses a certain buffering capacity and a high flexibility to adapt to and counteract different stresses without showing a distinct phenotype. These findings are important, e. g., for the development of whole-cell redox biocatalytic processes that impose equivalent burdens on the cell metabolism: stoichiometric consumption of (reduced) redox cofactors and increased energy expenditures, due to the toxicity of the biocatalytic compounds...|$|E

Molecular and biochemical studies revealed that there are eight IPT genes, OsIPT 1 to OsIPT 8, in the rice genome, including a pseudogene, OsIPT 6. Overexpression of OsIPTs in transgenic rice inhibited root development and promoted axillary bud growth, indicating that OsIPTs are functional in vivo. Phenotypes of OsIPT overexpressers resembled those of KNOX-overproducing transgenic rice, although OsIPT overexpressers did not form roots or ectopic meristems, {{both of which are}} observed in KNOX overproducers. Expression of two OsIPT genes, OsIPT 2 and OsIPT 3, was up-regulated in response to the induction of KNOX protein function with similar kinetics to those of down-regulation of GA 20 -oxidase genes, target genes of KNOX proteins in dicots. However, expression of these two OsIPT genes was not regulated in a feedback manner. These results suggest that OsIPT 2 and OsIPT 3 have unique roles in the developmental process, which is controlled by KNOX proteins, rather than in the maintenance of bioactive CK levels in rice. On the basis of these findings, we concluded that KNOX protein simultaneously decreases GA biosynthesis and increases de novo CK biosynthesis through the induction of OsIPT 2 and OsIPT 3 expression, and the resulting high-CK and low-GA condition is required for formation and maintenance of the meristem...|$|E
40|$|Methods of synthesizing {{a series}} of chemically-defined AMP, ADP, ATP, adenylyl imidodiphosphate and {{pyrophosphate}} derivatives suitable for affinity chromatography are extensively described. Each derivative has a single primary amino group {{at the end of}} a hexamethylene `spacer' chain for attachment to CNBr-activated agarose. The synthesis of the derivative where the `spacer' arm is attached directly to the 8 position of the adenine ring to produce 8 -(6 -aminohexyl) amino-AMP involves the direct bromination of AMP in the 8 position followed by displacement of the halogen by 1, 6 -diaminohexane. This monophosphate derivative can then be converted into the corresponding di- or triphosphate forms by direct phosphate condensation with carbonyl di-imidazole. A second series of <b>adenosine</b> <b>phosphate</b> derivatives with the phosphate moieties unsubstituted has been similarly prepared from N 6 -(6 -aminohexyl) -AMP (Guilford et al., 1972). A third type of ligand has been synthesized by condensing the phosphoryl imidazolide of AMP with 6 -aminohex- 1 -yl phosphate. This compound, P 1 -(6 -aminohex- 1 -yl) P 2 -(5 ′-adenosyl) pyrophosphate, has an unsubstituted adenine ring. The synthesis of a fourth type of ligand, 6 -aminohex- 1 -yl pyrophosphate, was done by heating 6 -aminohexan- 1 -ol with crystalline pyrophosphoric acid under reduced pressure. The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by chemical, electrophoretic and chromatographic methods and by u. v. spectrometry. The general applicability of the synthetic methods used is discussed in relation to the preparation of other affinity adsorbents. Examples are given where these derivatives have been successful in reversibly binding dehydrogenases, kinases and myosin and its proteolytic subfragments.

Within 1 - 6 h of hypoxic exposure, ATP levels decreased while ADP and AMP levels increased, producing a fall in calculated ATP/ADP and adenylate charge ratios. Concurrently, lactate/pyruvate and alpha-glycerophosphate/dihydroxyacetone phosphate ratios increased markedly. Direct measurements of cellular pyridine nucleotides indicated increased NADH/NAD and NADPH/NADP ratios. Levels of total <b>adenosine</b> <b>phosphates</b> and pyridine nucleotides decreased in a significant accompanying response. Many metabolite levels and calculated ratios returned to near-normal values within 1 week of exposure, indicating secondary intracellular adjustments to hypoxic stress; however, persistence of that stress is reflected in lactate concentrations and both substrate redox ratios. Results support and explore concepts that increased oxidation-reduction status and decreased energy status are primary events during hypoxia...|$|R
