40|$|Abstract: The fitting of {{security}} devices to motor vehicles {{has become an}} important approach to the prevention of motor vehicle crime. In cars, manu-facturers have focused primarily on improving perimeter security to prevent breaking-in to the vehicle, and installing devices to prevent parked vehicles from being unlawfully driven away. The steering column lock Is an Important example of this approach, being {{the outcome of the}} first and only regulations requiring vehicles to befitted with <b>anti-theft</b> <b>devices.</b> The Federal Republic of Germany was the first country to Introduce such regulations, In 1961, followed nearly ten years later by the U. S. and Britain. This paper examines the effect of these regulations on motor vehicle crime In each of these countries. The evidence from all three countries is that steering column locks have helped to bring vehicle theft, particularly theftfor temporary use, under control for lengthy periods. The paper provides evidence that the speed with which the vehicle population has been protected by steering column locks, and the availability of other types of vehicles notprotected by such <b>anti-theft</b> <b>devices,</b> are Important issues in explaining theft patterns...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the identification and}} limits of detection of ink staining by mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), as used in <b>anti-theft</b> <b>devices</b> (ATDs). Such ink staining is applied to banknotes during automated teller machine (ATM) explosions.

MAAQ could not be detected because of its inefficient desorption by DESI from the banknote cellulose surface. By contrast, ATD staining on banknotes is perceptible by the human naked eye only at concentrations higher than 0. 2 μgcm(- 2), whereas both RB and R 6 G at concentrations 200 times lower (as low as 0. 001 μgcm(- 2)) could be easily detected and imaged by DESI-MSI, with selective and specific identification of each analyte and their spatial distribution on samples from suspects.
