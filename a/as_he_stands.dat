5|$|At {{the end of}} Adventure, {{the player}} reaches an island called Maxwell's Island with a hall {{belonging}} to Maxwell on it. The player finds Maxwell trapped in a throne encircled by short stone pillars. The player is at first unable to free him, but finds a keyhole, {{as well as a}} key nearby. The player sets Maxwell free, but he turns into a skeleton and disintegrates as soon <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> up. The ghostly arms from the trailer then grab the player and ensnare them in the throne. An epilogue implies that the player will take on a villainous role similar to Maxwell's using newfound powers given by the throne, but will nonetheless be trapped forever.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} shot on 16 December 2009, in London, England. The video begins with footage from The X Factor and then {{transitions}} to a close-up shot of McElderry {{in the main}} setting, a flooded cityscape — the scene was shot in a flooded set with a cityscape backdrop. McElderry is clothed by a grey vest and a grey shirt, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> in the setting and performs. Throughout the entire video, scenes alternate between the flooded cityscape setting and recycled footage from The X Factor, which are {{in black and white}} until it shows him in the live shows in colour. The video concludes with McElderry being informed he won the competition, hugging his peers.|$|E

25|$|Ultima's Owl – Embodies Ultima's soul, {{the power}} of her mysticism, and her life force. The song the owl sings softly outside Antonio’s window at night {{indicates}} Ultima’s presence and magical protection in Antonio’s life. Ultima's owl scratches Tenorio's eye out <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> in Gabriel's doorway and demands {{the right to take}} Ultima away from Gabriel's house. By {{the end of the novel}} Tenorio has figured out the connection between Ultima and her owl. By killing Ultima's owl, Tenorio destroys Ultima’s soul and life force, which leads quickly to her death. Antonio takes on the responsibility of burying the owl and realizes that he is really burying Ultima.|$|E
500|$|There {{was a scene}} {{cut from}} [...] "33" [...] where we saw Laura being given her copy of the photo along with a card that said it was taken {{on the roof of}} the capitol {{building}} on Aerilon during the attack. The photo was inspired by the famous shot of the fire-fighters raising the flag at Ground Zero that became iconic. I thought the Colonies would have their own version of this -- a snapshot taken in the moment that becomes a symbol of the day they can never forget and of all they had lost. The photo itself is of a soldier falling to his knees (possibly shot or simply overcome by emotion) <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> on the rooftop over looking the devastation of his city, while the Colonial flag waves at the edge of frame. The inscription below the photo on Laura's plaque reads, [...] "Lest We Forget" [...] in itself a reference to the inscription on the watch presented to John Wayne's character in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{continually}} {{switches to}} flashbacks which {{show that the}} circumstances leading to Victor's death stemmed from a simple misunderstanding. A group of pilgrims descend upon the Meldrews' home after misunderstanding Margaret's classified advertisement in her local newspaper of {{a picture of the}} Virgin Mary with [...] "two small tears under her eyes". [...] Readers apparently took it to mean 'tears' (as in crying) rather than 'tears' (as in rips). As a result of their exposure in the local paper, Victor is contacted by an old acquaintance and invited to a works reunion. Victor, who is persuaded to go by Margaret, is informed by the barman (Paul Merton) [...] that {{all but one of the}} other guests have cancelled for various reasons. Sitting alone while waiting for Limpy, the one remaining potential attendee, Victor is entertained by two cabaret performers (Ed Welch— who wrote the incidental music for all series —and Jean Challis). Victor eventually leaves the pub, with Limpy arriving seconds after he leaves. At the railway station Victor telephones Margaret for a lift. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> at the side of the road waiting for his wife, a car appears and mounts the kerb; Victor is knocked down and killed.|$|E

500|$|The video {{starts with}} Carey {{walking in the}} rain to meet Ne-Yo who is waiting {{for her in the}} studio. Clips of Carey singing in desperation in the rain are intercut with footage of her {{recording}} her vocals in the recording booth. For his scenes, Ne-Yo sings <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> next to as well as plays the piano as Carey reminisces by herself, while other scenes show him in the booth with Carey as they sing their parts together. At the video's climax, both singers are belt the final note in the booth, which is followed by them walking out of the studio where it has stopped raining and the sun is shining. Robbie Daw wrote that the video gave him [...] "chills". He also commented on the use of product placement of Carey's perfume M and her own brand of champagne. Melinda Newman of HitFix thought that the video appeared to have a bigger production budget than that of the video for [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] with Minaj, but noted that it was still [...] "low-key" [...] for a Carey video. Newman further commented that while the singer appears to be wearing albeit little make-up, she looked more natural and [...] "beautiful" [...] than ever. Leonie Cooper thought that the video made the [...] "bland" [...] song more appealing: [...] "the video, with a moist Mariah mithering in the rain, preposterous sequinned gold boots, a puppy in the studio, and shameless pimping of her latest perfume, kind of makes up for it." ...|$|E

2500|$|For Kierkegaard's author, Vigilius Haufniensis, anxiety/dread/angst (depending on the {{translation}} and context) is unfocused fear. Haufniensis uses {{the example of}} a man standing {{on the edge of a}} tall building or cliff. From this height he can see all the possibilities of life. He's reflecting on what he could become if he only threw himself into the power of his own choice. As long <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> there he stands at the crossroads of life, unable to make a decision and live within its boundaries. The mere fact that one has the possibility and freedom to do something, even the most terrifying of possibilities, triggers immense feelings of dread. Haufniensis called this our [...] "dizziness of freedom."Anxiety may be compared with dizziness. He whose eye happens to look down into the yawning abyss becomes dizzy. But what is the reason for this? It is just as much in his own eye as in the abyss, for suppose he had not looked down. Hence, anxiety is the dizziness of freedom, which emerges when the spirit wants to [...] the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own possibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself. Freedom succumbs to dizziness. Further than this, psychology cannot and will not go. In that very moment everything is changed, and freedom, when it again rises, sees that it is guilty. Between these two moments lies the leap, which no science has explained and which no science can explain. He who becomes guilty in anxiety becomes as ambiguously guilty as it is possible to become.

2500|$|In {{the middle}} of the 19th century, Phineas Taylor (P.T.) Barnum {{introduces}} his circus acts <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> in front of a tent, proclaiming [...] "There Is a Sucker Born Ev'ry Minute". He loves spectacle and excitement, using hype and [...] "humbug" [...] to promote his exhibits. His wife Charity disagrees with his use of [...] "humbug" [...] but loves him and aims to keep him grounded. Barnum then introduces the oldest woman alive, Joice Heth, and thanks to some Barnum humbug she becomes a success ("Thank God I'm Old"). His wife Charity ("Chairy") urges him to get a job in a factory, but Barnum refuses ("The Colors of My Life [...] ") and Charity wryly admits and accepts the disparity between their views ("The Colors of My Life [...] "). Barnum enlists clowns to help in building a museum to house his attractions (with expected comical results) and it's up to Charity to encourage him to keep going ("One Brick at a Time"), with the result that [...] "everything about [...] museum was spectacular" [...] ("Museum Song"); however, the museum burns down accidentally. Barnum finds two new star attractions, Tom Thumb, who appears to advise that [...] "Bigger Isn't Better", and Jumbo the elephant. Barnum then becomes manager of the famous Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind ("Love Makes Such Fools of Us All"). Barnum becomes enamored of her and sees the attraction of going on tour with her ("Out There"). He accompanies Jenny on tour, leaving Charity behind, as a marching band greets them ("Come Follow the Band"). Although all seems to be going well for Barnum, he finds that without Charity in his life he is miserable, and he decides to break ties with Jenny and return home to the woman he loves ("Love Makes Such Fools of Us All [...] "). Upon his return to Charity, he promises to live the more sedate life she desires for him, in [...] "Black and White." [...] After a failed stint running a clockworks factory and a failed attempt to build his own city, he turns to politics; when his campaign looks doomed to fail due to lack of interest, Charity realizes how important his talents and passion are in his life and allows him to inject color and life into his campaign. He is elected Mayor of Bridgeport, {{and the two of them}} recognize the value in each other's approach to life and how they complement one another ("The Colors of My Life [...] "). Barnum is prepared to run for President, but his beloved Charity dies suddenly, leaving Barnum bereft and alone. When Barnum finds himself cheated of the Presidential nomination by his political party, he laments his position, realizes that his talent for Humbug will never leave him and wishes to [...] "make it right, shoot a rocket, shine a light" [...] ("Prince of Humbug"). James Anthony Bailey arrives and offers him the chance to [...] "Join the Circus". Initially resisting, he relents (thanks in part to Charity's two-headed coin, which she has used to humbug him throughout the show) and joins Bailey, and they form the famous circus Barnum and Bailey.|$|E

60|$|The word 'just,' therefore, in {{this place}} in special, respecteth a man that is just, or that so esteems himself by the law, and is here {{considered}} in a double capacity; first, what he is before men; secondly, what he is before God.
