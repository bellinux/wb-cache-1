To develop optimal strategies for minimizing cell injury due to intracellular ice formation and excessive volume shrinkage during cryopreservation, the fundamental transport properties including the osmotic inactive volume (Vb), the hydraulic conductivity (Lp), and the glycerol permeability (Ps) of Sf 21 cell membrane at 25, 15, 5 and - 2 °C were characterized using a micro-perfusion chamber.
