5|$|In their unmodified wild state, red foxes are {{generally}} unsuitable as pets. Many supposedly abandoned kits are adopted by well-meaning {{people during the}} spring period, though {{it is unlikely that}} vixens would abandon their young. Actual orphans are rare, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> are adopted are likely kits that simply strayed from their den site. Kits require almost constant supervision; when still suckling, they require milk at four-hour intervals day and night. Once weaned, they may become destructive to leather objects, furniture and electric cables. Though generally friendly toward people when young, captive red foxes become fearful of humans, save for their handlers, once they reach 10 weeks of age. They maintain their wild counterpart's strong instinct of concealment, and may pose a threat to domestic birds, even when well fed. Although suspicious of strangers, they can form bonds with cats and dogs, even ones bred for fox hunting. Practical uses for tame foxes are few, though they can be encouraged to kill rats and mice in granaries. Tame foxes were once used to draw ducks close to hunting blinds.|$|E

25|$|The {{principle}} of cross-cutting relationships {{pertains to the}} formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut.

Finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault.|$|E

25|$|In 1732 the Admiralty {{decided to}} ask the Master Shipwrights {{in each of the}} Royal dockyards to report to them on how best they thought the ships could be improved. The responses, when they finally arrived, were conservative, {{offering}} only minor adjustments to certain dimensions. There was little agreement between the changes proposed, and no further progress was made until May 1733 when Sir Jacob Ackworth of the Navy Board — the Surveyor of the Navy at the time — proposed to the Admiralty some changes to the dimensions of the 50-gun and 60-gun ships, most notably an increase in breadth. The Admiralty accepted these proposals, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> followed in later months for the other types, and these new dimensions became the effective new Establishment, though they never technically superseded the 1719 dimensions; there was no 1733 Establishment. Indications are that the Admiralty desired more far-reaching reforms that what was actually implemented, but {{due in part to the}} absence of anyone with practical shipbuilding knowledge on the Board, the Board of Admiralty lacked the ability to realise them.|$|E

No one of these descriptions can be scientifically proven to be the [...] "one, true" [...] description of the world.

500|$|... "Circus" [...] is an uptempo electropop and dance-pop song, with a stomp box {{beat and}} {{elements}} of pop rock. [...] The song opens {{with the sound}} of a drum and builds until Spears starts singing, [...] "There's only two types of people in the world/The ones that entertain <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> observe". Spears delivers confident and [...] "half-rapped" [...] vocals, with the verses having usage of synthesizers. Lyrically, the song talks about being an entertainer and putting on shows. She explains her emotions while performing in lines such as: [...] "I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins / Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break". The chorus begins with an electronic sound, while she compares herself, as well as performing to being on the center of a circus ring. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, [...] "Circus" [...] is composed in the key of F# minor with 120 beats per minute, however on the album the song is 115 beats per minute. Spears's vocal range spans from G#2 to D#5. Kelly commented that [...] "Circus" [...] was [...] "a cool way to get people dancing and having fun", but also have a slight message.|$|E
500|$|The season {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews, after two seasons {{that resulted in}} heavy critical acclaim. Following a positive outlook on the second season, Christopher Monfette of IGN Entertainment expressed disappointment during the third one, mainly due to the declining quality and lack of realism of the storylines. He noted {{a growing number of}} similarities between the season's arcs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> are developed in soap operas, by stating that [...] "the line which separates primetime television from soap opera is oftentimes razor thin" [...] and admitting that, despite his considering the series [...] "the best drama", he freely admits that it requires some inherent suspension of disbelief, after it [...] "found itself mired in the annoying and absurd". Whereas Monfette acknowledged that the fans would consider the problem to have been a simple case of lazy writing, he noted that over-writing played a main role in the series becoming unexpectedly unrealistic. He also noted the senseless intrigues in the Derek/Meredith relationship, by stating that the season would not have achieved high ratings if a functional relationship had been introduced: [...] "The season generally opts to stall out for its vast majority, providing Meredith with some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season's worth of reconsidering to do".|$|E
