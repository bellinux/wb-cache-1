5|$|Clindamycin is a semisynthetic {{derivative}} of lincomycin, a natural antibiotic {{produced by the}} actinobacterium Streptomyces lincolnensis. It is obtained by 7(S)-chloro-substitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of lincomycin. The synthesis of clindamycin was first announced by BJ Magerlein, RD Birkenmeyer, and F Kagan on the fifth Interscience Conference on <b>Antimicrobial</b> <b>Agents</b> and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) in 1966.

5|$|Elemental {{tellurium}} is {{not considered}} particularly toxic; two grams of sodium tellurate, if administered, can be lethal. People exposed to small amounts of airborne tellurium exude a foul and persistent garlic-like odour. Tellurium dioxide {{has been used to}} treat seborrhoeic dermatitis; other tellurium compounds were used as <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> before the development of antibiotics. In the future, such compounds may need to be substituted for antibiotics that have become ineffective due to bacterial resistance.|$|E
5|$|A strain is a {{subgroup}} {{within the}} species that has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other strains. These differences are often detectable only at the molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium. For example, a strain may gain pathogenic capacity, {{the ability to use}} a unique carbon source, the ability to take upon a particular ecological niche, or the ability to resist <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents.</b> Different strains of E. coli are often host-specific, making it possible to determine the source of fecal contamination in environmental samples. For example, knowing which E. coli strains are present in a water sample allows researchers to make assumptions about whether the contamination originated from a human, another mammal, or a bird.|$|E
30|$|A three step {{approach}} {{was employed to}} unravel {{the nature of the}} substantial <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agent</b> produced by P. aeruginosa strain EGYII DSM 101801. Firstly, the antimicrobial activity was retained 100  % after boiling of the crude supernatant at 100  °C for 10  min. In addition, the <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agent</b> was not adversely affected by incubation with proteinase K for 30  min at 55  °C. This in turn indicated the non-proteinous (most probably non-bacteriocin) nature of the <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agent</b> of quest. Secondly, no zone of inhibition was detected in well-cut diffusion assay of E. amylovora strain EGY 1 DSM 101800 containing 100  µM FeCl 3; however, agar diffusion plates prepared without FeCl 3 showed perceivable zones of inhibition around the wells containing the <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agent</b> of quest. This verified the siderophore nature of the tested <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: Minimum Inhibitory Concentration: Tube Dilution Assay is {{performed}} by constantly increasing the percent concentration of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agent</b> to microbial rich broth {{in a series}} of tubes. It is used to measure the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration MIC of an <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agent,</b> which is the lowest concentration of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agent</b> which will inhibit the growth of microbes. The turbidity of the tubes indicates the amount of microbe growth, with the least turbid, or clear, tubes (tubes 6 and 7) correlating with the absence of microbes. The tube with no <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agent</b> (tube 1) presents as opaque and most turbid because the microbes are able to flourish. As antimicrobial concentration increases, the turbidity decreases until the MIC is reached and microbes can no longer survive. Antimicrobials with low MICs are more effective than those with high MICs, as only a low dosage is necessary to eradicate microbes.|$|R

25|$|Patulin is a {{white powder}} soluble in low-pH water and organic solvents. It is a polyketide lactone that is heat-stable, {{so it is not}} {{destroyed}} by pasteurization or thermal denaturation. However, stability following fermentation is lessened. Isoepoxydon dehydrogenase (IDH) is an important enzyme in the multi-step biosynthesis of patulin, and its gene is present in other fungi that may potentially produce the toxin. It is reactive with sulfur dioxide, so antioxidant and <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> may be useful to destroy it. Levels of nitrogen, manganese, and pH as well as abundance of necessary enzymes regulate the biosynthetic pathway of patulin.|$|E
25|$|Saliva is {{a watery}} {{substance}} {{formed in the}} mouths of animals, secreted by the salivary glands. Human saliva comprises 99.5% water, plus electrolytes, mucus, white blood cells, epithelial cells (from which DNA can be extracted]]), glycoproteins, enzymes (such as amylase and lipase), <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> such as secretory IgA and lysozyme. The enzymes found in saliva are essential in beginning the process of digestion of dietary starches and fats. These enzymes {{also play a role}} in breaking down food particles entrapped within dental crevices, thus protecting teeth from bacterial decay. Furthermore, saliva serves a lubricative function, wetting food and permitting the initiation of swallowing, and protecting the mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity from desiccation.|$|E
25|$|For the {{mosquito}} {{to obtain a}} blood meal, it must circumvent the vertebrate's physiological responses. The mosquito, as with all blood-feeding arthropods, has mechanisms to effectively block the hemostasis system with their saliva, which contains a mixture of secreted proteins. Mosquito saliva negatively affects vascular constriction, blood clotting, platelet aggregation, angiogenesis and immunity, and creates inflammation. Universally, hematophagous arthropod saliva contains at least one anti-clotting, one anti-platelet, and one vasodilatory substance. Mosquito saliva also contains enzymes that aid in sugar feeding and <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> to control bacterial growth in the sugar meal. The composition of mosquito saliva is relatively simple, as it usually contains fewer than 20 dominant proteins. Despite the great strides in knowledge of these molecules and their role in blood feeding achieved recently, scientists still cannot ascribe functions to {{more than half of}} the molecules found in arthropod saliva. One promising application is the development of anti-clotting drugs, such as clotting inhibitors and capillary dilators, that could be useful for cardiovascular disease.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} these {{promising}} advantages, nisin is the only bacteriocin {{generally recognized as safe}} by the Food and Drug Administration and is currently used as a food preservative in several countries.This limitation in bacteriocins availability in the market as preservatives and antimicrobials can be attributed to multiple factors, including: (i) the high cost of their commercial production; (ii) the loss of their activity by proteolytic enzymes; (iii) their unfavorable interactions with other food constituents, which decreases the availability and necessitates a huge amount of the peptide to be added; (iv) the alterations of the chemical and physical properties of these compounds during the various food-processing stages; (v) the low yield of these compounds due to ineffective recovery by traditional purification methods; and (vi) the narrow spectrum of activity observed for most of the tested bacteriocins against pathogenic bacteria. In the last years, several studies on bacteriocins have demonstrated that the optimization of their production conditions, their purification methods, their combinations with other <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents,</b> the hurdle technology approach, and nanotechnology formulations, could all represent solutions to some of the previously mentioned problems.|$|E
25|$|The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), {{which oversees}} the {{regulation}} of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> and materials in that country, found that copper alloys kill more than 99.9% of disease-causing bacteria within just two hours when cleaned regularly. Copper and copper alloys are unique classes of solid materials as no other solid touch surfaces have permission in the U.S. to make human health claims (EPA public health registrations were previously restricted only to liquid and gaseous products). The EPA has granted antimicrobial registration status to 355 different copper alloy compositions. In healthcare applications, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include bedrails, handrails, over-bed tables, sinks, faucets, door knobs, toilet hardware, intravenous poles, computer keyboards, etc. In public facility applications, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include health club equipment, elevator equipment, shopping cart handles, etc. In residential building applications, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include kitchen surfaces, bedrails, footboards, door push plates, towel bars, toilet hardware, wall tiles, etc. In mass transit facilities, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include handrails, stair rails grab bars, chairs, benches, etc. A comprehensive list of copper alloy surface products that have been granted antimicrobial registration status with public health claims by the EPA can be found here: Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces#Approved products.|$|E
25|$|Nepenthes {{digestive}} fluids are sterile before pitchers {{open and}} contain secondary metabolites and proteins {{that act as}} bactericides and fungicides after the pitcher opens. While the digestive fluid is being produced, the pitcher is not yet open, {{so there is no}} chance of microbial contamination. During pitcher development, at least 29 digestive proteins including proteases, chitinases, pathogenesis-related proteins and thaumatin-like proteins are produced in the pitcher fluid. In addition to breaking down prey, these can act as <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents.</b> When the pitchers open, the fluid is exposed to bacteria, fungal spores, insects and rain. Often pitchers have a lid that covers the trap, excepting a few (e.g. N. lowii, N. attenboroughii and N. jamban), preventing rain water from entering. The lid inhibits rainwater from diluting the digestive fluid. Once the bacteria and fungi enter the fluid, secondary metabolites are produced in addition to antimicrobial proteins. Naphthoquinones, a class of secondary metabolite, are commonly produced, and these either kill or inhibit the growth and reproduction of bacteria and fungi. This adaptation could have evolved since Nepenthes plants that could produce secondary metabolites and antimicrobial proteins to kill bacteria and fungi were most likely more fit. Plants that produced antimicrobial compounds could prevent loss of valuable nutrients gained from insects within the pitcher. Since Nepenthes cannot digest certain bacteria and fungi, the bactericides and fungicides allow plants to maximize nutrient uptake.|$|E
