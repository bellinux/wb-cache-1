50|$|Traditional benzodiazepines are {{associated}} with side effects such as drowsiness, physical dependence and abuse potential. It was hoped that bretazenil and other partial agonists would be an improvement on traditional benzodiazepines which are full agonists due to preclinical evidence that their side effect profile was {{less than that of}} full agonist benzodiazepines. For a variety of reasons however, bretazenil and other partial agonists such as pazinaclone and <b>abecarnil</b> were not clinically successful. However, research continues into other compounds with partial agonist and compounds which are selective for certain GABAA benzodiazepine receptor subtypes.|$|E
40|$|Benzodiazepines (BZDs) {{are highly}} {{effective}} to suppress {{various types of}} seizures; however, their clinical use is limited due to adverse effects and tolerance and dependence liability. Drugs that act only as partial agonists at the BZD recognition site (initially termed "BZD receptor") of the GABAA receptor chloride ionophore complex or exhibit a GABAA receptor subtype-selectivity {{are thought to have}} advantages vs. full agonists such as diazepam and most other clinically used BZDs in that such compounds have less adverse effects and reduced or absent tolerance and dependence liability. One of such compounds, <b>abecarnil,</b> has been clinically evaluated as a novel anxiolytic drug, but, despite its potent preclinical anti-seizure activity, it has not yet been evaluated in patients with epilepsy. In the present proof-of-concept study, we performed a within-subject placebo-controlled, single oral dose study of <b>abecarnil</b> in patients with photosensitive epilepsy. Flumazenil, which is generally considered a BZD receptor antagonist, but has slight partial agonistic properties, was used for comparison. In total, 12 patients were enrolled in this study. <b>Abecarnil,</b> 5 or 10 mg, completely abolished the photo-paroxysmal EEG response, while flumazenil, 30, 60 or 100 mg, was less effective. The anti-epileptic effect of <b>abecarnil</b> was significantly different from both placebo and flumazenil. Sedative adverse effects were observed after <b>abecarnil</b> but not flumazenil. The study substantiates previous pre-clinical experiments that <b>abecarnil</b> exerts pronounced anti-seizure activity. Epilepsy is often associated with anxiety, so that the anxiolytic activity of <b>abecarnil</b> would be an added advantage when using this compound in epilepsy patients...|$|E
40|$|Development of {{tolerance}} and dependence {{has been reported to}} occur upon chronic administration of traditional benzodiazepines (BZDs). We compared the effect of chronic treatment with <b>abecarnil,</b> a beta-carboline derivative with high affinity for central BDZ receptors, and diazepam, the BDZ prototype, in mice. After acute administration, <b>abecarnil</b> was as potent and effective as diazepam in protecting from bicuculline-induced convulsion. The time-course analysis of two peak equieffective doses of <b>abecarnil</b> (1. 9 mg/kg p. o.) and diazepam (2. 7 mg/kg p. o.) showed a similar duration of action. The anticonvulsant potency of diazepam was reduced in mice given chronic diazepam (25 mg/kg p. o., 2 times a day for 17 days). No tolerance to <b>abecarnil</b> was apparent when the drug was administered for the same period using a comparable dose (20 mg/kg p. o.). Severe symptoms of precipitated withdrawal were observed upon administration of the BDZ partial inverse agonist Ro 15 - 3505 in mice treated chronically with diazepam but not <b>abecarnil.</b> In mice made tolerant to diazepam, maximum [3 H]-flumazenil binding sites were reduced in both cerebral cortex (- 50 %) and cerebellum (- 55. 2 %). No changes in [3 H]-flumazenil binding were measured in chronic abecarnil-treated mice. These data indicate that <b>abecarnil</b> possesses a very low tolerance/dependence liability and does not affect BZD receptor density after chronic administration...|$|E
40|$|<b>Abecarnil</b> (0. 1 - 1 mg/kg i. p.), a new anxioselective and {{anticonvulsant}} ligand of benzodiazepine receptors, like diazepam (2. 5 - 10 mg/kg i. p.) inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the basal {{release of}} acetylcholine in the hippocampus of freely moving rats.

40|$|Treatment with {{diazepam}} (25 mg/kg; p. o., twice-daily for 17 days) induced {{tolerance to}} the anticonvulsant effect of diazepam against bicuculline-induced convulsions in mice. Cross-tolerance was observed to the anticonvulsant action of clonazepam, imidazenil but not <b>abecarnil.</b> While substitution of clonazepam (12 mg/kg; p. o., twice-daily for 15 days) for diazepam {{did not affect}} tolerance to diazepam, substitution of imidazenil (17 mg/kg; p. o., twice-daily for 15 days) for diazepam significantly increased sensitivity to the anticonvulsant effect of diazepam, although tolerance was not abolished. Tolerance to diazepam progressively decreased either after suspension of diazepam administration or replacement treatment with <b>abecarnil</b> (20 mg/kg; p. o., twice-daily). Complete recovery of diazepam efficacy was detected after 8 and 15 days of administration of <b>abecarnil</b> and vehicle, respectively. Binding experiments using [H- 3]-flumazenil showed that K-d values did not differ among treatment groups. A significant decrease in B-max (- 42 %) was observed in the cortex of diazepam-tolerant mice whether or not also treated with imidazenil and clonazepam. Conversely, chronically diazepam-treated mice, that further received <b>abecarnil</b> for either 8 or 15 days or vehicle for 15 days showed B-max values {{similar to those of}} vehicle-treated mice never exposed to diazepam. Results suggest that repeated <b>abecarnil</b> administration to diazepam-tolerant mice can facilitate re-adaptation of receptors to the diazepam-free state. It is proposed that replacement therapy with <b>abecarnil</b> after long-term treatment with conventional benzodiazepines (BDZs) may provide a novel approach for reducing tolerance to their anticonvulsant effects.

Challenge doses of diazepam, <b>abecarnil,</b> and imidazenil decreased the extracellular acetylcholine concentration in the hippocampus by the same extent in animals chronically treated with the respective drug or vehicle. Moreover, the abrupt discontinuation of long-term treatment with diazepam, <b>abecarnil,</b> or imidazenil failed to affect hippocampal acetylcholine release during the first 5 days of withdrawal. In contrast, the acute administration of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (1 mg/kg, IP) 2 days after diazepam withdrawal elicited a marked increase (65 %) in acetylcholine release in the hippocampus. Flumazenil failed to induce the same effect 5 days after diazepam withdrawal or 2 or 5 days after discontinuation of long-term treatment with <b>abecarnil</b> or imidazenil. These results indicate that (i) the inhibitory effects of full (diazepam), partial (imidazenil), and selective (<b>abecarnil)</b> benzodiazepine receptor agonists on acetylcholine output in rat hippocampus are not affected by repeated drug administration; (ii) discontinuation of long-term treatment with each type of agonist does not affect hippocampal cholinergic mechanisms;; and (iii) flumazenil increases acetylcholine release only in the hippocampus of rats chronically treated with diazepam.

In contrast, whereas diazepam and midazolam significantly decreased dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex, <b>abecarnil</b> and imidazenil had no effect on basal dopamine output. The effects of these drugs on both acetylcholine and dopamine release were antagonized by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (1 mg/kg i. p.). Footshock stress (0. 2 mA for 500 msec/sec) delivered for 8 min induced a rapid and marked (+ 75 %) increase in hippocampal acetylcholine output that persisted for similar to 40 min. Foot-shock stress also increased dopamine release in the cerebral cortex; the effect was maximal (+ 90 %) after 20 min and persisted for similar to 30 min. Prior administration of <b>abecarnil</b> or imidazenil at a dose (0. 05 mg/kg) that did not significantly affect the basal release of either acetylcholine or dopamine completely prevented the effect of stress on the output of these neurotransmitters, an effect mimicked by higher doses of diazepam (2. 5 mg/kg) and midazolam (2. 5 mg/kg). Ethanol, at a dose (0. 5 g/kg i. p.) that did not affect basal acetylcholine release, markedly potentiated the effect of diazepam (2. 5 mg/kg) on hippocampal acetylcholine output. In contrast, ethanol enhanced the action of imidazenil and failed to potentiate the effect of <b>abecarnil</b> on acetylcholine release.

Added in vitro to rat cortical membrane preparation, <b>abecarnil</b> increased [3 H]GABA binding, enhanced muscimol-stimulated 36 Cl- uptake and reduced the binding of t-[35 S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35 S]TBPS).

Kindled rats were examined either 3 or 30 days after discontinuation of PTZ treatment. The amounts of gamma(2) L and gamma(2) S subunit mRNAs were significantly increased in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of kindled rats 3 and 30 days after treatment discontinuation, compared with those observed in control rats, and these effects were prevented by the concomitant administration of the anticonvulsant <b>abecarnil.</b> In contrast, the amounts of alpha(1) and beta(2) subunit mRNAs in these two brain regions did not differ significantly between kindled and control rats.

40|$|Abrupt {{termination}} of the treatment of humans with benzodiazepines (BDZs) leads to a rapid onset of discontinuation syndrome characterized by anxiety, muscle spasms, and occasionally convulsions.

Nevertheless, many clinicians report signs of dependence even during gradual reduction of doses (tapering) of the BDZs in a large proportion of patients. Thus, there is considerable interest in discovering means of weaning patients away from BDZs without the risk of discontinuation syndrome.

40|$|The role of {{gamma-aminobutyric acid}} (GABA) {{modulation}} of septohippocampal cholinergic neurons in kindling was investigated, Hippocampal acetylcholine release was evaluated with the microdialysis technique in freely moving rats either after acute administration of isoniazid (an inhibitor of GABA synthesis) or pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (a blocker of the GABA(A) receptor-associated Cl- channel) or after chronic administration of PTZ. Short-term treatment with PTZ (5 - 50 mg/kg, i. p.) or isoniazid (150 - 250 mg/kg, s. c.) increased hippocampal acetylcholine release in a dose-dependent manner.

The potency of various BDZs and PIs as inhibitors of specific [3 H]flumazenil binding to neuronal membranes, was also evaluated. The radioligand binding study, carried out on stable cell lines expressing definite combinations of benzodiazepine receptor subunits, demonstrated that 1 b, 1 e, 1 d, and 1 h have preferential interaction with alpha(1), beta(3), gamma(2), receptor subtypes...|$|E
40|$|Various {{lines of}} {{evidence}} suggest a functional interaction between GABA(A) and Neuropeptide Y (NPY) -Y- 1 receptor (Y 1 R) mediated transmissions in various brain regions, {{which can be}} important in the regulation of sedation, feeding, anxious behaviour and neuronal excitability. By using a transgenic, mouse model carrying the murine Y 1 R gene promoter fused to the lacZ reporter gene (Y 1 R/LacZ mice), we showed that prolonged pharmacologically or physiologically induced changes in the cerebrocortical concentrations of the neuroactive steroids 3 alpha-hydroxy 5 alpha-pregnan- 20 -one (3 alpha, 5 alpha TH PROG) and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (3 alpha, 5 alpha TH DOC) increases Y 1 R/LacZ transgene expression in the central and medial amygdala, an effect similar to that induced by long-term treatment with positive modulators of the GABAA receptor complex (diazepam or <b>abecarnil).</b> We also demonstrated that fluctuations in the cerebrocortical concentrations of 3 alpha, 5 alpha-TH PROG and 3 alpha, 5 alpha TH DOC during voluntary ethanol consumption and ethanol withdrawal induces a marked increase in Y 1 R gene expression that becomes apparent 48 h after withdrawal. These data provide evidence that neuroactive steroids may {{play an important role}} in the functional interaction between the GABA(A) receptor and NPY-Y 1 R mediated pathways in the amygdala, which might represent an important regulatory mechanism for modulation of several functions, including ethanol withdrawal.

40|$|The {{differences}} in intrinsic activity and receptor subtype specific-ity {{of the newly}} developed benzodiazepine receptor ligands bretazenil, divaplon and <b>abecarnil</b> were assessed in recombinant-y-aminobutyric acid,, (GABAA) receptors expressed in mamma-han cells from the subunit-cDNA combinations a 392 y 2 and a 5 fl 2 ’y 2. Chloride currents induced by rapid application of GABA in {{the presence or absence}} of drugs were measured using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Bretazenil displayed an intrinsic activity which amounted only to 58 ± 7 % and 35 ± 1 1 % of that of flunitrazepam at the a 3. 32 y 2 and a 5 $ 2 -y 2 combination, respectively. The maximum potentiation by divaplon was only 28 ± 5 % and 21 ± 9 % of that of flunitra-zepam at the respective subunit combinations. Thus, the partial agonism postulated for bretazenil and divaplon on pharmacolog-ical grounds is shown to be operative on the level of single GABAA receptors. Most strikingly, abecamil potentiated the GABA response to the same degree as flunitrazepam at the a 3 fl 2 y 2 combination but to only 52 ± 14 % compared to flunitra-zepam at the a 5 fl 2 ’y 2 combination. This finding demonstrates that the intrinsic activity of benzodiazepine receptor ligands can vary among the receptor subtypes with the degree of receptor modulation being influenced by the type of a subunit. GABAA receptors display a pronounced structural heteroge-neity due to the expression of a family of at least 16 subunit genes in the brain (al- 6, / 31 - 4, yl- 3, #{ 244 },p 1 - 2) (for review Mohle...|$|E
40|$|Stressful stimuli and {{anxiogenic}} drugs {{increase the}} plasma and brain concentrations of neuroactive steroids. Moreover, in rats trained to consume their daily meal during a fixed period, {{the anticipation of}} food is associated with changes in the function of various neurotransmitter systems. We have now evaluated the effects of anticipation and consumption of food in such trained rats on the plasma and brain concentrations of 3 alpha-hydroxy- 5 alpha-pregnan- 20 -one (3 alpha, 5 alpha-TH PROG) and 3 alpha, 21 -dihydroxy- 5 alpha-pregnan- 20 -one (3 alpha, 5 alpha-TH DOC), two potent endogenous positive modulators of type A receptors for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The abundance of these neuroactive steroids was increased in both the cerebral cortex and plasma of the rats during both food anticipation and consumption. In contrast, the concentration of their precursor, progesterone, was increased in the brain only during food consumption, whereas it was increased in plasma only during food anticipation. Intraperitoneal administration of the selective agonist <b>abecarnil</b> (0. 1 mg/kg) 40 min before food presentation prevented {{the increase in the}} brain levels of 3 alpha, 5 alpha-TH PROG and 3 alpha, 5 alpha-TH DOC during food anticipation but not that associated with consumption. The change in emotional state associated with food anticipation may thus result in an increase in the plasma and brain levels of 3 alpha, 5 alpha-TH PROG and 3 alpha, 5 alpha-TH DOC in a manner sensitive to the activation of GABA(A) receptor-mediated neurotransmission. A different mechanism, insensitive to activation of such transmission, may underlie the changes in the concentrations of these neuroactive steroids during food consumption.

40|$|In {{electrophysiological}} measurements the β-carboline ethyl 6 -benzyloxy-β-carboline- 3 -carboxylate (ZK 91085) acts as {{a positive}} allosteric modulator on rat recombinant α 1 β 2 γ 2 GABAA receptors and binds with high affinity (IC 50 = 1. 5 [*]nM) to the [3 H]-flunitrazepam site. Flumazenil was able to partially counteract the current modulation. These observations indicate an action of ZK 91085 at the benzodiazepine binding site. At the dual subunit combination α 1 β 2, which lacks the γ subunit required for benzodiazepine modulation, we still observed a potentiation of GABA currents. Thus ZK 91085 acts via an additional site on the channel. At the subunit combination α 1 β 1, ZK 91085 potentiation is strongly reduced as compared to α 1 β 2. In binding studies, ZK 91085 was able to decrease [35 S]-TBPS binding in α 1 β 2 γ 2 and α 1 β 2 but not in α 1 β 1. This selectivity of ZK 91085 for receptors containing the β 2 isoform over those containing the β 1 isoform {{is reminiscent of the}} action of loreclezole. To identify amino acid residues important for the second type of modulation, we functionally compared wild type α 1 β 2 and mutant receptors for stimulation by ZK 91085. The mutation β 2 N 265 S, that abolishes loreclezole effects, also abolishes ZK 91085 stimulation. The mutation β 2 Y 62 L increased stimulation by ZK 91085 3 – 4 fold, locating an influencing entity of the second type of action of ZK 91085 at an α/β subunit interface. Structural intermediates of ZK 91085 and the β-carboline <b>abecarnil,</b> the latter of which only slightly potentiated GABA currents in α 1 β 2, were analysed to determine structural requirements for modulation. ZK 91085 thus allosterically stimulates the GABAA receptor through two sites of action: the benzodiazepine site and the loreclezole site in contrast to classical β-carbolines, that confer negative allosteric modulation through the benzodiazepine site...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} relationship between a reduction in brain GABAA receptor function and the cerebro-cortical content of 3 α-hydroxy- 5 α-pregnan- 20 one (allopregnanolone, AP), a potent endogenous positive modulator of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) action at GABAA receptors, with anticonflict and anticonvulsant effects in rodents. An acute depletion of the cerebral content of GABA or an attenuation of GABAA receptor-mediated transmission by systemic injections of isoniazid (375 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, s. c.) or FG 7142 (15 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.) induced a transient increase in the cerebro-cortical and plasma concentrations of AP in handling-habituated (not stressed) rats. Two stress paradigms, handling in naive rats and mild foot shock in handling-habituated rats, that reduce central GABAergic tone mimicked the effects of isoniazid and FG 7142 on cortical AP content; foot shock in handling-habituated rats, but not handling in naive animals, also increased plasma AP. Isoniazid, FG 7142, and foot shock also each increased the concentrations of the AP precursors, pregnenolone and progesterone, in both brain and plasma of handling-habituated rats, whereas handling in naive rats increased the concentrations of these steroids only in brain. Pretreatment of handling-habituated rats with the anxiolytic β-carboline derivative <b>abecarnil,</b> a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, which per se failed to affect the AP concentration in brain or plasma, prevented the increase in brain and plasma AP induced by foot shock or isoniazid. In adrenalectomized and castrated rats foot shock or isoniazid failed to increase AP both in brain cortex and plasma. These observations indicate that inhibition of GABAergic transmission, induced by foot shock or pharmacological manipulations, results in an increase in the concentrations of AP in brain and plasma, possibly via a modulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Given that AP enhances GABAA receptor function with high efficacy and potency, an increase in brain AP concentration may be important in the fine tuning of the GABA-mediated inhibitory transmission in the central nervous system...|$|E
