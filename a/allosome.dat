25|$|Chromosomes {{in humans}} {{can be divided}} into two types: autosomes (body chromosome(s)) and <b>allosome</b> (sex chromosome(s)). Certain genetic traits are linked to a person's sex and are passed on through the sex chromosomes. The autosomes contain the rest of the genetic {{hereditary}} information. All act in the same way during cell division. Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes), giving a total of 46 per cell. In addition to these, human cells have many hundreds of copies of the mitochondrial genome. Sequencing of the human genome has provided {{a great deal of information}} about each of the chromosomes. Below is a table compiling statistics for the chromosomes, based on the Sanger Institute's human genome information in the Vertebrate Genome Annotation (VEGA) database. Number of genes is an estimate, as it is in part based on gene predictions. Total chromosome length is an estimate as well, based on the estimated size of unsequenced heterochromatin regions.|$|E
5000|$|For example, {{humans have}} a diploid genome that usually {{contains}} 22 pairs of autosomes and one <b>allosome</b> pair (46 chromosomes total). The autosome pairs are labeled with numbers (1-22 in humans) roughly {{in order of}} their sizes in base pairs, while allosomes are labelled with their letters. [...] By contrast, the <b>allosome</b> pair consists of two X chromosomes in females or one X and one Y chromosome in males. (Unusual combinations of XYY, XXY, XXX, XXXX, XXXXX or XXYY, among other <b>allosome</b> combinations, are known to occur and usually cause developmental abnormalities.) ...|$|E
50|$|An <b>allosome</b> (also {{referred}} to as a sex chromosome, heterotypical chromosome, heterochromosome, or idiochromosome) is a chromosome that differs from an ordinary autosome in form, size, and behavior. The human sex chromosomes, a typical pair of mammal allosomes, determine the sex of an individual created in sexual reproduction. Autosomes differ from allosomes because autosomes appear in pairs whose members have the same form but differ from other pairs in a diploid cell, whereas members of an <b>allosome</b> pair may differ from one another and thereby determine sex.|$|E
50|$|Sex {{determination}} in sciara is {{a different}} mechanism. Sciara basically has 4 pairs of chromosomes 3 pairs of autosomes and one pair of <b>allosomes.</b> Some special chromosomes called limited chromosomes are present in certain stages.|$|R
25|$|The {{normal human}} karyotypes contain 22 pairs of {{autosomal}} chromosomes and {{one pair of}} sex chromosomes (<b>allosomes).</b> Normal karyotypes for females contain two X chromosomes and are denoted 46,XX; males have both an X and a Y chromosome denoted 46,XY. Any variation from the standard karyotype may lead to developmental abnormalities.|$|R
25|$|The X {{chromosome}} {{is one of}} the two sex-determining chromosomes (<b>allosomes)</b> in many organisms, including mammals (the {{other is}} the Y chromosome), and is found in both males and females. It {{is a part of the}} XY sex-determination system and X0 sex-determination system. The X chromosome was named for its unique properties by early researchers, which resulted in the naming of its counterpart Y chromosome, for the next letter in the alphabet, after it was discovered later.|$|R
50|$|Sex linkage is the {{phenotypic}} {{expression of}} an allele {{related to the}} <b>allosome</b> (sex chromosome) of the individual. In autosomal chromosomes both sexes have the same probability of existing (see Fisher's principle), but since humans have many more genes on the female X chromosome than on the male Y chromosome, these are much more common than Y-linked traits.|$|E
5000|$|An {{autosome}} is {{a chromosome}} {{that is not}} an <b>allosome</b> (a sex chromosome). [...] An autosome is a pair of chromosomes in a diploid cell in which each chromosome has the same form. Allosomes, on the other hand, have different form and thereby determine sex. The DNA in autosomes is collectively known as atDNA or auDNA.|$|E
50|$|The {{haploid number}} for humans (half of 46) is 23; and the {{monoploid}} number equals 46 {{divided by the}} ploidy level of 2, which is also 23. When a human germ cell undergoes meiosis {{the two sets of}} 23 chromosomes are split in half to form gametes. After fusion of a male and a female gamete (fertilization) both containing 1 set of 23 chromosomes, the resulting zygote has 46 chromosomes: 2 sets of 23 chromosomes (22 autosomes, and 1 <b>allosome).</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Allosomes</b> {{not only}} carry {{the genes that}} {{determine}} male and female traits, but also those for some other characteristics as well. Genes that are carried by either sex chromosome {{are said to be}} sex linked. Sex-linked diseases are passed down through families through one of the X or Y chromosomes. Since only men inherit Y chromosomes, they are the only ones to inherit Y-linked traits. Men and women can get the X-linked ones since both inherit X chromosomes.|$|R
50|$|Mutation in only {{a single}} gene {{can lead to the}} {{evolution}} of a resistant organism. In other cases, multiple genes are involved. Resistant genes are usually autosomal. This means that they are located on autosomes (as opposed to <b>allosomes,</b> also known as sex chromosomes). As a result, resistance is inherited similarly in males and females. Also, resistance is usually inherited as an incompletely dominant trait. When a resistant individual mates with a susceptible individual, their progeny generally has a level of resistance intermediate between the parents.|$|R
5000|$|In humans, {{each cell}} nucleus {{contains}} 23 pairs of chromosomes, {{a total of}} 46 chromosomes. The first 22 pairs are called autosomes. Autosomes are homologous chromosomes i.e. chromosomes which contain the same genes (regions of DNA) {{in the same order}} along their chromosomal arms. The chromosomes of the 23rd pair are called <b>allosomes</b> consisting of two X chromosomes in women, and an X chromosome and a Y chromosome in men. Women therefore have 23 homologous chromosome pairs, while men have 22. The X and Y chromosomes do have small regions of homology called pseudoautosomal regions.|$|R
50|$|Chromosomes {{in humans}} {{can be divided}} into two types: autosomes (body chromosome(s)) and <b>allosome</b> (sex chromosome(s)).

40|$|BACKGROUND: We wish to {{understand}} how sex and recombination affect endogenous retroviral insertion and deletion. While theory suggests {{that the risk of}} ectopic recombination will limit the accumulation of repetitive DNA in areas of high meiotic recombination, the experimental evidence so far has been inconsistent. Under the assumption of neutrality, we examine the genomes of eighteen species of animal in order to compute the ratio of solo-LTRs that derive from insertions occurring down the male germ line as opposed to the female one (male bias). We also extend the simple idea of comparing autosome to <b>allosome</b> in order to predict the ratio of full-length proviruses we would expect to see under conditions of recombination linked deletion or otherwise. RESULTS: Using our model, we predict the ratio of allosomal to autosomal full-length proviruses to lie between 32 and 23 under increasing male bias in mammals and between 1 and 2 under increasing male bias in birds. In contrast to our expectations, we find that a pattern of male bias is not universal across species {{and that there is a}} frequent overabundance of full-length proviruses on the <b>allosome</b> beyond the ratios predicted by our model. CONCLUSIONS: We use our data as a whole to argue that full-length proviruses should be treated as deleterious mutations or as effectively neutral mutations whose persistence in a full-length state is linked to the rate of meiotic recombination and whose origin is not universally male biased. These conclusions suggest that retroviral insertions on the <b>allosome</b> may be more prolific and that it might be possible to identify mechanisms of replication that are enhanced in the female sex...|$|E
40|$|In {{developing}} a {{general theory of}} sex, {{it is necessary to}} consider all the fundamental phenomena of sexuality which occur in all the diverse types of plants and animals with their diverse types of life cycles, times of chromosome reduction, and diploid and haploid generations, otherwise a very incomplete or improper view of the subject will surely be obtained. Sexual dimorphisims, or sex limited characters are present from very low types of plants and animals and continue to the highest representatives of both kingdoms. The general nature of sex-limited characters differs in no wise in the higher forms from the lower except that the higher may have a much greater com-plexity of hereditary factors that may be influenced by the sexual state in their expression. The presence of allosomes in a few plants and in apparently all of the higher animals complicates the study of sexuality and must be carefully considered, as well as the mode of trans-mission of the hereditary potentialities, if proper deductions are to be made as to the nature of sexuality in such forms. Heteromorphic <b>allosome</b> mates plainly have differences in hereditary factors and since these chromosomes have a peculiar and usually definite distribution in relation to the sex of the individual, they give rise to characteristic sex-limited sex-influenced, and sex-associated characters. It is the intention to present in a very brief way an explan-ation of certain phenomena {{from the standpoint of the}} functional nature of sex in order to make clear to students who dea...|$|E
50|$|All diploid organisms with allosome-determined sex get half {{of their}} <b>allosomes</b> from each of their parents. In mammals, females are XX, they can pass along either of their X’s, and since the males are XY they can pass along either an X or a Y. For a mammal to be chromosomally female, the {{individual}} must receive an X chromosome from both parents, whereas to be chromosomally male, the individual must receive a X chromosome from their mother and a Y chromosome from their father. It is thus the male’s sperm that determines the sex of each offspring in humans.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, the human <b>allosomes</b> are engrossed in an {{intensive}} attention among researchers. The <b>allosomes</b> are now already been sequenced and found there are about 2000 and 78 genes in human X and Y chromosomes respectively. The hemizygosity of the human X chromosome in males exposes recessive disease alleles, and this phenomenon has prompted decades of intensive study of X-linked disorders. By contrast, {{the small size of}} the human Y chromosome, and its prominent long-arm heterochromatic region suggested absence of function beyond sex determination. But the present problem is to accomplish whether a given sequence of nucleotides i. e. a DNA is a Human X or Y chromosomal genes or not, without any biological experimental support. In our perspective, a proper quantitative understanding of these genes is required to justify or nullify whether a given sequence is a Human X or Y chromosomal gene. In this paper, some of the X and Y chromosomal genes have been quantified in genomic and proteomic level through Fractal Geometric and Mathematical Morphometric analysis. Using the proposed quantitative model, one can easily make probable justification or deterministic nullification whether a given sequence of nucleotides is a probable Human X or Y chromosomal gene or not, without seeking any biological experiment. Of course, a further biological experiment is essential to validate it as the probable Human X or Y chromosomal gene homologue. This study would enable Biologists to understand these genes in more quantitative manner instead of their qualitative features...|$|R
5000|$|The XX/XY sex-determination {{system is}} the most familiar, as it is found in humans. The XX/XY system is found in most other mammals, {{as well as some}} insects. In this system, most females have two of the same kind of sex {{chromosome}} (XX), while most males have two distinct sex chromosomes (XY). The X and Y sex chromosomes are different in shape and size from each other, unlike the rest of the chromosomes (autosomes), and are sometimes called <b>allosomes.</b> In some species, such as humans, organisms remain sex indifferent for a time after they're created; in others, however, such as fruit flies, sexual differentiation occurs as soon as the egg is fertilized.|$|R
2500|$|The Y {{chromosome}} {{is one of}} two sex chromosomes (<b>allosomes)</b> in mammals, including humans, {{and many}} other animals. The other is the X chromosome. Y is the sex-determining chromosome in many species, since it is {{the presence or absence of}} Y that determines the male or female sex of offspring produced in sexual reproduction. In mammals, the Y chromosome contains the gene SRY, which triggers testis development. The DNA in the human Y chromosome is composed of about 59 million base pairs. The Y chromosome is passed only from father to son. With a 30% difference between humans and chimpanzees, the Y chromosome is one of the fastest-evolving parts of the human genome. To date, over 200 Y-linked genes have been identified. All Y-linked genes are expressed and (apart from duplicated genes) hemizygous (present on only one chromosome) except in the cases of aneuploidy such as XYY syndrome or XXYY syndrome. (See Y linkage.) ...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{variations}} play {{a crucial}} role in differential phenotypic outcomes. Given the complexity in establishing this correlation and the enormous data available today, it is imperative to design machine-readable, efficient methods to store, label, search and analyze this data. A semantic approach, FROG: "FingeRprinting Ontology of Genomic variations" is implemented to label variation data, based on its location, function and interactions. FROG has six levels to describe the variation annotation, namely, chromosome, DNA, RNA, protein, variations and interactions. Each level is a conceptual aggregation of logically connected attributes each of which comprises of various properties for the variant. For example, in chromosome level, one of the attributes is location of variation and which has two properties, <b>allosomes</b> or autosomes. Another attribute is variation kind which has four properties, namely, indel, deletion, insertion, substitution. Likewise, there are 48 attributes and 278 properties to capture the variation annotation across six levels. Each property is then assigned a bit score which in turn leads to generation of a binary fingerprint based on the combination of these properties (mostly taken from existing variation ontologies). FROG is a novel and unique method designed for the purpose of labeling the entire variation data generated till date for efficient storage, search and analysis. A web-based platform is designed as a test case for users to navigate sample datasets and generate fingerprints. The platform is available at [URL]...|$|R
