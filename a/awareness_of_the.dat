5|$|Early {{proposals}} {{made by the}} National Capital Park and Planning Commission {{involved a}} route that followed US1 north to MD198, then east to Fort Meade, but lack of funding led to simpler plans to widen US 1 instead. During the 1930s, the New Deal programs promulgated by President Franklin Roosevelt led to a heightened <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parkway proposals; a 1937 report by the Maryland State Planning Commission increased awareness further. Increasing accident levels on US 1 (which was {{called one of the}} deadliest roads in the world at the time) along with <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> need to mobilize national defense before World War II provided additional motivation for construction of the parkway.|$|E

The lack of clinician <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> signs -symptoms and ailments- of a CSF leak is the greatest challenge to proper diagnosis and treatment, in particular: the loss of the orthostatic characteristic of headache and that every chronic CSF leaker will have a unique symptom set that as a whole contributes to the underlying condition, and diagnosis of, a CSF leak.|$|E

5|$|Although {{antidepressants}} with anxiolytic properties {{have been}} introduced, {{and there is}} increasing <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adverse effects of benzodiazepines, prescriptions for short-term anxiety relief have not significantly dropped. For treatment of insomnia, benzodiazepines are now less popular than nonbenzodiazepines, which include zolpidem, zaleplon and eszopiclone. Nonbenzodiazepines are molecularly distinct, but nonetheless, they work on the same benzodiazepine receptors and produce similar sedative effects.|$|E
5|$|As the West German public's <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SS atrocities {{grew in the}} 1970s and 1980s, {{the attitudes}} towards Waffen-SS {{veterans}} shifted dramatically. The federal organisation and the local groups were ostracised, with their meetings and commemorations greeted with protests. At the same time, neo-Nazi and nationalist movements found in the Waffen-SS an icon to project their understanding of World War II.|$|E
