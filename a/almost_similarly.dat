In young birds the scutellae on the tarsi and toes are generally of a leaden-black colour; and this is a remarkable character (though observed in a lesser degree in some other breeds), as the colour of the legs in the adult state is subject to very little variation in any breed. I have on two or three occasions counted thirteen or fourteen feathers in the tail; this likewise occurs in the barely distinct breed called Helmets. Nuns are symmetrically coloured, with the head, primary wing-feathers, tail, and tail-coverts of the same colour, namely, black or red, and {{with the rest of the}} body white.

60|$|The Mount, a hill {{believed}} to be 450 feet in height, from which the place takes its name, is much the highest land in this neighbourhood: it consists of hornblendic slate, which (except on the eastern and disturbed base) has an east and west nearly vertical cleavage; the longer axis of the hill also ranges in this same line. Near the summit the hornblende-slate gradually {{becomes more and more}} coarsely crystallised, and less plainly laminated, until it passes into a heavy, sonorous greenstone, with a slaty conchoidal fracture; the laminae on the north and south sides near the summit dip inwards, as if this upper part had expanded or bulged outwards. This greenstone must, I conceive, be considered as metamorphosed hornblende- slate. The Cerrito, the next highest, but much less elevated point, is <b>almost</b> <b>similarly</b> composed.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{present the results}} of a {{practical}} experience on the evaluation of two message-passing middleware platforms for developing distributed applications, i. e. the ACE/TAO Real Time Event Channel (RTEC) and the Maestro/Ensemble group communication toolkit (M/E). In particular, we compare their functionalities and their performances in a simple yet meaningful deployment configuration. The functional comparison points out the different characteristics of the two systems. In particular, M/E simplifies the coding of applications with strong requirements in terms of group membership tracking and ordered message delivery guarantees, while RTEC provides users with unreliable message delivery between loosely coupled processes. The performance comparison shows that, under stressing conditions, M/E sacrifices throughput stability for enforcing reliable and ordered message delivery, while RTEC offers a more stable throughput of unordered messages sacrificing message delivery reliability under heavy load. In normal operating conditions, the two systems perform <b>almost</b> <b>similarly.</b> ...|$|E

A classical description and an adiabatic separation of the methyl rotation from other molecular motion previously used in peptide models is not applicable to toluene because of a strong coupling with other vibrational motions.
