40|$|The {{concept of}} using a more highly <b>alloyed</b> welding <b>product</b> to weld {{corrosion}} resistant alloys is not new. Early examples are 317 LMN and 904 L being welded with INCONEL ® FM 625 and INCONEL WE 112. There are more than five well-known pit and crevice-corrosion resisting nickel alloys that benefit from being welded with the superalloy INCO-WELD ® 686 CPT®. In addition, {{there is a greater}} number of super austenitic and super duplex stainless steels, that may be used to their maximum capabilities when welded with the overmatching fully austenitic, INCO-WELD 686 CPT products. Typical applications and performance criteria include the fabrication of flue gas desulfurisation (FGD) equipment where extreme pitting and crevice corrosion environments are generated by scrubbing high concentrations of sulfur and halogens from coal-fired boilers. These environments often include chloride concentrations beyond 100, 000 ppm and pH levels of less than 1. Super austenitic and super duplex stainless steels are continuing to find wide acceptance in handling aggressive fluids in pulp and paper applications. Bleach plant piping and vessels are often specified in stainless steels that need much better welds than matching composition can supply. It is no small task to meet the weld requirements of nickel superalloys and th...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} treatment of Al- 25 at. % Fe and Al- 34 at. % Fe mixtures of pure elemental powders in a high-energy mixer-mill induces solid solution formation and substantial solid state reactivity. Neutron diffraction {{data were collected}} over a wide Q-range. A quantitative phase evaluation {{was carried out by}} the Rietveld method which enabled us to overcome problems of peak overlapping between the two constituent phases. Changes of lattice parameters, as well as lattice strain and average crystallite size were also determined versus the processing time. The local magnetic environment around the iron atoms was simultaneously monitored by means of the Mossbauer spectroscopy. The formation of an extended bcc solid solution for prolonged treatment times is confirmed even for the present Al-rich compositions. Neutron diffraction experiments after annealing of the Al- 25 at. % Fe mechanically <b>alloyed</b> end <b>products</b> revealed a polymorphous phase transformation after 85 minutes at 583 K, accounting for the metastable character of these materials. The transformation product, Al 5 Fe 2, is orthorhombic and stoichiometrically near to the nominal composition. The short interatomic Al-Al distances, resulting from the analysis of the unit cell properties, suggests that oxygen impurities may be present in the system and may play a role for the observed reactivity. In the case of Al- 34 at. % Fe composition the products are the Al 5 Fe 2 and FeAl intermetallic phases...|$|R
