5|$|Reproductive {{success is}} {{strongly}} affected by insects that infest the flower spikes and fruiting structures. Infestation {{of the flower}} spikes is not <b>as</b> <b>severe</b> <b>as</b> in other Banksia species: one study found less than 10% of B.telmatiaea inflorescences to be infested, compared to over 50% for B.attenuata (Candlestick Banksia), B.littoralis and B.menziesii (Menzies' Banksia), and over 90% for B.grandis (Bull Banksia). Also, whereas other species were attacked by a range of insects, the inflorescence of B.telmatiaea was attacked only by the tortrix moth Arotrophora arcuatalis (Banksia Boring Moth), which burrows into the woody axis, rendering the spike barren. On the other hand, the same study observed heavy infestation of fruiting structures, with over 90% of spikes with follicles found to contain at least one larva of an unidentified species of moth of the genus Xylorycta. These larvae burrow from follicle to follicle to eat the seed, resulting in 100% seed loss for infested spikes.|$|E
5|$|The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis {{affected}} the economy, {{resulting in a}} lingering decline {{of the value of}} the peso and falls in the stock market. The extent it was affected initially was not <b>as</b> <b>severe</b> <b>as</b> that of some of its Asian neighbors. This was largely due to the fiscal conservatism of the government, partly as a result of decades of monitoring and fiscal supervision from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in comparison to the massive spending of its neighbors on the rapid acceleration of economic growth. There have been signs of progress since. In 2004, the economy experienced 6.4% GDP growth and 7.1% in 2007, its fastest pace of growth in three decades. Average annual GDP growth per capita for the period 1966–2007 still stands at 1.45% in comparison to an average of 5.96% for the East Asia and the Pacific region as a whole. The daily income for 45% of the population of the Philippines remains less than $2.|$|E

5|$|This system {{developed}} as a tropical depression just offshore {{the west coast of}} Africa on September6. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm later that day, shortly before passing south of the Cape Verde Islands. Further intensification was slow and halted by late on September7. However, about 48hours later, the storm resumed strengthening and became a Category1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Still moving westward, the system reached Category4 intensity before striking Guadeloupe on September12. There, the storm brought 1,200deaths and extensive damage, including the destruction of approximately 85%–95% of banana crops, the severe damage dealt to 70%–80% of tree crops, and the roughly 40% of the sugar cane crops ruined. Martinique, Montserrat, and Nevis also reported damage and fatalities, but the impacts at those locations were not nearly <b>as</b> <b>severe</b> <b>as</b> in Guadeloupe.|$|E
