25|$|A {{number of}} {{countries}} and cities adopted Bertillon's system, {{which was based on}} the principle of distinguishing between general diseases and those localized to a particular organ or <b>anatomical</b> <b>site,</b> as used by the City of Paris for classifying deaths. Subsequent revisions represented a synthesis of English, German, and Swiss classifications, expanding from the original 44 titles to 161 titles. In 1898, the American Public Health Association (APHA) recommended that the registrars of Canada, Mexico, and the United States also adopt it. The APHA also recommended revising the system every ten years to ensure the system remained current with medical practice advances. As a result, the first international conference to revise the International Classification of Causes of Death took place in 1900, with revisions occurring every ten years thereafter. At that time, the classification system was contained in one book, which included an Alphabetic Index as well as a Tabular List. The book was small compared with current coding texts.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To compare {{cutaneous}} and nasal population levels {{between patients}} colonized and infected by multidrug-resistant organisms in two intensive care units. Methods: A prospective cohort study {{was performed in}} adult intensive care units of two hospitals in Belo Horizonte, Brazil (April 2012 to February 2013). Clinical and demographic data were first collected by reviewing patients’ charts. Then, samples collected with nasal, groin, and perineum swabs were cultivated in selective media for 48 [*]h at 37 °C. After isolation, determination of antimicrobial susceptibility and biochemical identification were performed. Results: A total of 53 cases of colonization were observed by the following bacteria in decreasing frequencies: imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (50. 9 %), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (43. 4 %), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase–producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (37. 7 %), imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (32. 1 %), oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (7. 5 %), and imipenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (5. 7 %). Among these colonization cases, 26 (49. 0 %) were followed by infection with bacteria phenotypically {{similar to those of}} the colonization. A relation between high population levels of colonization by most of the multidrug-resistant organisms at <b>anatomical</b> <b>sites</b> and a subsequent infection was observed.

40|$|AbstractTo explore {{definitions}} for multisite pain, {{and compare}} associations with {{risk factors for}} different patterns of musculoskeletal pain, we analysed cross-sectional data from the Cultural and Psychosocial Influences on Disability (CUPID) study. The study sample comprised 12, 410 adults aged 20 – 59 years from 47 occupational groups in 18 countries. A standardised questionnaire was used to collect information about pain {{in the past month}} at each of 10 <b>anatomical</b> <b>sites,</b> and about potential risk factors. Associations with pain outcomes were assessed by Poisson regression, and characterised by prevalence rate ratios (PRRs). Extensive pain, affecting 6 – 10 <b>anatomical</b> <b>sites,</b> was reported much more frequently than would be expected if the occurrence of pain at each site were independent (674 participants vs 41. 9 expected). In comparison with pain involving only 1 – 3 sites, it showed much stronger associations (relative to no pain) with risk factors such as female sex (PRR 1. 6 vs 1. 1), older age (PRR 2. 6 vs 1. 1), somatising tendency (PRR 4. 6 vs 1. 3), and exposure to multiple physically stressing occupational activities (PRR 5. 0 vs 1. 4). After adjustment for number of sites with pain, these risk factors showed no additional association with a distribution of pain that was widespread according to the frequently used American College of Rheumatology criteria. Our analysis supports the classification of pain at multiple <b>anatomical</b> <b>sites</b> simply by the number of sites affected, and suggests that extensive pain differs importantly in its associations with risk factors from pain that is limited to {{only a small number of}} <b>anatomical</b> <b>sites...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Until 2008, {{two types}} were recognized, {{complicated}} skin and skin structure infection (cSSSI) and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infection (uSSSI). [...] "Uncomplicated" [...] SSSIs included simple abscesses, impetiginous lesions, furuncles, and cellulitis. [...] "Complicated" [...] SSSIs included infections either involving deeper soft tissue or requiring significant surgical intervention, such as infected ulcers, burns, and major abscesses or a significant underlying disease state that complicates {{the response to}} treatment. Superficial infections or abscesses in an <b>anatomical</b> <b>site,</b> such as the rectal area, where the risk of anaerobic or gram-negative pathogen involvement is higher, should be considered complicated infections. The two categories had different regulatory approval requirements. The uncomplicated category (uSSSI) is normally only caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, whereas the complicated category (cSSSI) might also {{be caused by a}} number of other pathogens. In cSSSI, the pathogen is known in only about 40% of cases. Because cSSSIs are usually serious infections, physicians do not have the time for a culture to identify the pathogen, so most cases are treated empirically, by choosing an antibiotic agent based on symptoms and seeing if it works. To achieve efficacy, physicians use broad-spectrum antibiotics. This practice contributes in part to the growing incidence of antibiotic resistance, a trend exacerbated by the widespread use of antibiotics in medicine in general. The increased prevalence of antibiotic resistance is most evident in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This species is commonly involved in cSSSIs, worsening their prognosis, and limiting the treatments available to physicians. Drug development in infectious disease seeks to produce new agents that can treat MRSA.|$|E

PCC can also cause malignant hypertension. The diagnosis can be established by measuring catecholamines and metanephrines in plasma or through a 24-hour urine collection. Surgical resection of the tumor is the treatment of first choice, either by open laparotomy or else laparoscopy. Given the complexity of perioperative management, and the potential for catastrophic intra and postoperative complications, such surgery should be performed only at centers experienced in the management of this disorder.|$|E
