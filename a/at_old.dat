40|$|We use the 1998 - 2006 {{waves of}} the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to {{investigate}} how households change their asset holdings <b>at</b> <b>older</b> ages. We find a notable increase in the net worth of older households between 1998 and 2006, {{with most of the}} growth due to housing. Our results indicate that, through 2006, older households did not spend all of their capital gains. This asset accumulation provides older households with a financial cushion for the turbulence experienced after 2007. The wealth distribution is highly skewed, and the age patterns of asset accumulation and decumulation vary considerably by income group. High-income seniors increase assets <b>at</b> <b>older</b> ages. Middle-income seniors reduce their assets in retirement, but at a rate that for most seniors will not deplete assets within their expected life. Many low-income seniors accumulate fewer assets and spend their financial assets at a rate that will mostly deplete them <b>at</b> <b>older</b> ages, leaving low-income seniors with only Social Security and DB pension income <b>at</b> <b>older</b> ages. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{duration}} of life {{has captured the}} attention of people for thousands of years. Deaths at younger ages are now unusual in developed countries. Most deaths occur there <b>at</b> <b>older</b> ages, and survival <b>at</b> <b>older</b> ages is now a hot topic. If death <b>at</b> <b>older</b> ages can be further postponed, then the rate of growth {{of the population of the}} oldest old will quicken, which will have major economic and social consequences. These may include escalation in the costs of health care and retirement programs. In this paper we review selected recent findings on survival <b>at</b> <b>older</b> ages. We first examine mortality in relation to age, and here we emphasize the intriguing result that mortality deceleration occurs in human and non-human populations. In a next step we investigate trends in late life mortality in recent decades. There were marked improvements in survival <b>at</b> <b>older</b> ages, which is in contrast to the belief that there are fixed limits to length of life and life expectancy. In a concluding section we focus on behavioral and psychological factors that may be relevant for determining mortality outcomes. Mortality Deceleration Demographers have long been interested in the shape of the age-trajectory of human mortality. The general nature of this trajectory from birth to age 80 or so is well known...|$|R
