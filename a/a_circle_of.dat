Dependent upon the water level in the loch, the remains can still be seen today.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the area}} of a curve is reduced at a {{constant}} rate, and (by the isoperimetric inequality) a circle has the greatest possible area among simple closed curves of a given length, it follows that circles are the slowest curves to collapse to a point under the curve-shortening flow. All other curves take less time to collapse than <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> the same length.|$|E

5|$|Beyond {{the area}} of Roman occupation, {{in the west and}} north, there are over 60 sites {{identified}} of wheelhouses. Perhaps a development of earlier Atlantic roundhouses, these have a characteristic outer wall surrounding <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel). Over 400 souterrains, small underground constructions, have been discovered in Scotland, many of them in the south-east, and although few have been dated, those that have suggest a construction date in the second or third centuries CE. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products.|$|E
5|$|Efe's obverse dies {{show the}} king's name and title, usually spelt {{with a mixture}} of runes and Latin script, with some aspects of the coins {{occasionally}} ill-drawn or omitted altogether. The king's name is generally arranged around the central motif of a pellet (or a cross) within <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> pellets: this layout probably derived from Northumbrian coins. The reverse dies consisted of a cross and the letters E F E, placed in four sectors that were divided off by lines. It can be shown that Efe did not use his dies in any particular or consistent order. Calculations have been made that suggest that few of his dies remain undiscovered.|$|E
5|$|Howard and {{her husband}} were part of <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> artists, writers and {{designers}} who were interested in visual images, in language and in the book arts. One close associate was the graphic designer Allan Fleming, whose Martlet Press published Twenty-Eight Drawings by Barbara Howard in 1970, a period when she was drawing the figure. The Canadian wood engraver Rosemary Kilbourn, a close friend since art college, taught Howard to carve images that could be printed in conjunction with text.|$|E
50|$|In a {{study on}} the <b>Circle</b> <b>of</b> Willis and its {{relation}} to cerebral vascular disorders, a comparison on various anomalies between normal brains (those without the condition of cerebral softening) and brains with cerebral softening were looked at to observe trends in the differences of the anatomical structure <b>of</b> the <b>Circle</b> <b>of</b> Willis. Statistically significant results were found in the percentage of normal brains that had <b>a</b> normal <b>Circle</b> <b>of</b> Willis and those that had cerebral softening and had <b>a</b> normal <b>Circle</b> <b>of</b> Willis. The results yielded 52% of normal brains having <b>a</b> normal <b>Circle</b> <b>of</b> Willis, while only 33% of brains with cerebral softening had <b>a</b> normal <b>Circle</b> <b>of</b> Willis. There were also a higher number of string-like vessels in brains with cerebral softening (42%), than there were in normal brains (27%). These results point to an assumption of a higher incidence rate of anomalies in brains with cerebral softening versus those that do not have cerebral softening.|$|R

5|$|Papa Stour is {{the subject}} of a 1299 {{manuscript}} written in Old Norse, which is the oldest surviving document from Shetland. It deals with a dramatic incident in the house of Duke Hakon Magnusson, who was later to become King Hakon V of Norway. There is <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> stones near the beach at Housa Voe, which are the remains of a 'ting', or local assembly. This was the scene of a duel, fought and won by Lord Thorvald Thoresson, who was accused of corruption in the 1299 document and was later called ‘dominus de Papay’. (The story of his unfortunate daughter is referred to above.) The remains of Duke Hakon's thirteenth-century house are still visible near Housa Voe.|$|E
5|$|Plants are {{classified}} as trees, shrubs, herbaceous perennials, and annual herbs (poai); these divisions are acknowledged to be rough and ready, as is the division into wild or cultivated, whereas the aquatic/terrestrial division appeared to be natural. Theophrastus notes that some plants are irregular, while the silver fir has branches always opposite each other and other plants have branches equally spaced or in rows. Figs have the longest roots, while the banyan sends roots down from the shoots, forming <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> roots at a distance all round the trunk.|$|E
5|$|Proponents of {{this idea}} point out that moralists during Bosch's era {{believed}} that it was woman'sultimately Eve'stemptation that drew men into a life of lechery and sin. This would explain why the women in the center panel are very much among the active participants in bringing about the Fall. At the time, the power of femininity was often rendered by showing a female surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> males. A late 15th-century engraving by Israhel van Meckenem shows a group of men prancing ecstatically around a female figure. The Master of the Banderoles's 1460 work the Pool of Youth similarly shows a group of females standing in a space surrounded by admiring figures.|$|E

5|$|Rossini {{composed}} the Petite messe solennelle in 1863, 34 {{years after his}} last opera, in Passy, where he spent the last decades of his life. Rossini and his wife entertained <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> friends, holding samedi soirs for which he composed several pieces of chamber music, often vocal, which the composer called his péchés de vieillesse (sins of old age). The mass was possibly commissioned by Count Alexis Pillet-Will for his wife Louise to whom it is dedicated, but the musicologist Nancy P. Fleming points out that Rossini may have had reasons of his own to compose it, and dedicated it in response to staging the first performance.|$|E
5|$|The Voortrekkers faced {{competition}} for the area they were entering from Mzilikazi and his Ndebele (or Matabele) people, a recent offshoot from the Zulu Kingdom to the south-east. On 16 October 1836 the 11-year-old Kruger {{took part in the}} Battle of Vegkop, where Potgieter's laager, <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> wagons chained together, was unsuccessfully attacked by Mzilikazi and around 4,000–6,000 Matabele warriors. Kruger and the other small children assisted in tasks such as bullet-casting while the women and larger boys helped the fighting men, of whom there were about 40. Kruger could recall the battle in great detail and give a vivid account well into old age.|$|E
5|$|The general {{statement}} of Apollonius' {{problem is to}} construct one or more circles that are tangent to three given objects in a plane, where an object may be a line, a point or <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> any size. These objects may be arranged in any way and may cross one another; however, they are usually taken to be distinct, meaning {{that they do not}} coincide. Solutions to Apollonius' problem are sometimes called Apollonius circles, although the term is also used for other types of circles associated with Apollonius.|$|E

Eight presumed sites have been identified in Orkney although the style is different from those of Shetland and the Western Isles.

5|$|Zwingli's time as {{the pastor}} of Glarus and Einsiedeln was {{characterized}} by inner growth and development. He perfected his Greek and he took up the study of Hebrew.

He exchanged scholarly letters with <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> Swiss humanists and began to study the writings of Erasmus. Zwingli took the opportunity to meet him while Erasmus was in Basel between August 1514 and May 1516.
