25|$|Tuten spent 15 years {{heading the}} {{graduate}} program in creative {{writing at the}} City College of New York, which he co-founded. In that capacity, he championed the work of students Walter Mosley, Oscar Hijuelos, Philip Graham, Aurelie Sheehan, Salar Abdoh, Ernesto Quiñonez, and many others. He also teaches classes on experimental writing at The New School. He {{is on the board}} of advisors for Guernica Magazine and executive editor of Smyles & Fish. Tuten's short fiction has appeared in Granta, Conjunctions, Fence, Fiction, The New Review of Literature, Tri-Quarterly, and Harper's Magazine. In 1973, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Writing and in 2001 was given the Award for Distinguished Writing from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In describing his usage of the past in his novels (where many of them are set), Tuten once stated:The fact that I don’t write about contemporary life doesn’t mean I’m any less taken up with it. I find it too limiting to write about contemporary life just in contemporary diction, however. I don’t think there's enough flexibility. I can imagine writing about characters who feel passion for one another in a contemporary setting but I don’t, as yet, hear the language for that. But I’m always thinking about contemporary life vis a vis the way it looks in the past. I mean how it looks in the past is a reflection of what it is today. That's what interests me. I think I’m <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> present-day life, not only political life but about the quality of passion, the quality of all relationships and love.|$|E
500|$|Chapter 27 {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{controversial}} films of the 2000s. In April 2006, an on-line petition group calling themselves Boycottchapter27.org campaigned to [...] "pressurise [...] movie theatres not to show the film, to stop the glorification of a murderer." [...] Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, expressed her thought saying, [...] "This is another thing which will hurt me, I'm sure. I would rather not make a story out of Mr. Chapman at all, although I sympathize with the actors. They need to work. It's not just films, you're <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> it [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|During October and November 2005, Wenger became {{embroiled in}} a war of words with Chelsea manager José Mourinho. Mourinho accused Wenger of having an [...] "unprofessional obsession" [...] with Chelsea and {{labelled}} him a [...] "voyeur." [...] Mourinho was quoted as saying, [...] "He's worried about us, he's <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> us – it's [...] Chelsea". Wenger responded by pointing out he was only answering journalists' questions about Chelsea, and described Mourinho's attitude as [...] "disrespectful". Mourinho later apologised and clarified that he regretted his [...] "voyeur" [...] comment; Wenger accepted the apology. In 2014, Mourinho reopened his feud with Wenger by calling him a [...] "specialist in failure". This {{was in response to}} Wenger's comments that Chelsea were favourites for the Premier League and managers did not want to take responsibility if they failed to win the title. Wenger said Mourinho's comments were [...] "silly and disrespectful" [...] and had embarrassed Chelsea. When asked if he regretted his remark, Mourinho replied: [...] "You have to ask him if he regrets the comments he made". In October 2014, during a Premier League match between Arsenal and Chelsea, Wenger was involved in a touchline spat with Mourinho. Wenger later apologised for his behaviour.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{shooting}} of Help!, a piano was placed {{on one of the}} stages where filming was being conducted and McCartney took advantage of this opportunity to tinker with the song. Richard Lester, the director, was eventually greatly annoyed by this and lost his temper, telling McCartney to finish writing the song or he would have the piano removed. The patience of the other Beatles was also tested by McCartney's work in progress, George Harrison summed this up when he said: [...] "Blimey, he's <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> that song. You'd think he was Beethoven or somebody!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 12, 2015, a Facebook post by {{the student}} {{government}} president Payton Head described bigotry and anti-gay sentiment around the college campus, which gained widespread attention. He claimed that in an incident off campus, unidentified people {{in the back of}} a passing pickup truck directed racial slurs at him. [...] "For those of you who wonder why I'm <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the importance of inclusion and respect, it's because I've experienced moments like this multiple times at THIS university, making me not feel included here." [...] Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin called the incident [...] "totally unacceptable" [...] on September 17.|$|E

2500|$|Moreno's lyrics were {{described}} by Time as [...] "suggesting emotions rather than announcing them". Moreno himself described his lyrics as ambiguous and sometimes impersonal, saying: [...] "I {{like to be}} ambiguous when writing to a certain extent, and throwing something so brash [...] against that and playing with it. And also making it sound dimensional. Giving the feeling off that it is raw and it is emotional, but it's not just connected with our personal story. It's not merely about our career and our lives, it's bigger than that. When I hear the music, I get inspired to paint the lyrical pictures you describe, but I'm not <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> myself". The band's legacy {{has been compared to}} alternative rock group Radiohead, with some dubbing Deftones [...] "The Radiohead of metal".|$|E
2500|$|Almost 40 years later, writer Peter Guralnick {{wrote that}} Presley found it [...] "good {{running around with}} Nick... there was always {{something}} happening, and the hotel suite was like a private clubhouse where you needed to know the secret password to get in and he got to change the password every day." [...] Presley's girlfriend June Juanico complained the singer was <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> his friend Adams and James Dean. She also was upset that Adams had started inviting himself to see Elvis, and Juanico felt that she was trying to compete for Elvis' attention. Adams would talk often about Natalie Wood to Elvis, constantly discussing her figure and her beauty, something else that caused Juanico to feel that she would soon lose Elvis to the glitz of Hollywood. Presley's own mother even commented about Adams, [...] "He sure is a pushy little fellow".|$|E

[...] Dave Brubeck observed, [...] "I don't think there's any more chance of another Tatum turning up than another Mozart." [...] Pianist Mulgrew Miller, commented on personal growth by saying, [...] "When I talk to the people I admire, they're <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> continuous growth and development and I look at them and say, 'Well... what are YOU going to do?' But, as Harold Mabern says, 'There's always Art Tatum records around'". Dizzy Gillespie said, [...] "First you speak of Art Tatum, then take a long deep breath, and you speak of the other pianists." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Come Up Show following a recent performance in Canada in April 2011, Method Man replied with this regarding his current 'weed-loving' image: [...] "When you get older and you've got kids and your {{kids are going to}} school and you know [...] teachers...and they see how active you are and concerned [...] with your kids' education or well being, it's hard to sit there and be taken seriously if people are <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> he's always high...which is totally not the case", he said. [...] "When I first came out, I was young, we were doing our thing, we smoked a lot...and we didn't care if the world knew. Now, I have to use more discretion because of my kids. This is not for me; everything I do is for them now, so I use a bit more discretion and I don't put weed as a forefront any more." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following Behind the Green Door, the Mitchell Brothers and Chambers {{teamed up}} for Resurrection of Eve, {{released}} in September 1973. Although not the runaway blockbuster that Green Door was, Eve {{was a hit}} and a well-received entry into the porno chic market. It also helped set Chambers apart from her contemporaries Linda Lovelace and Georgina Spelvin as the wholesome, all-American girl next door. Following Eve, Chambers was anxious to transition her fame into other areas of entertainment. At the time the Mitchell Brothers were still her managers. [...] "They were <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> some half-assed idea I knew wouldn't come off", Chambers said in 1992. Flakes' is a terrible word but they were, in a cute sort of way". Chambers had always considered the brothers as her own brothers but when she abruptly announced that she was leaving them to take up with Chuck Traynor, they were appalled and had a falling out with Chambers.|$|E
2500|$|Helen Chadwick (18 May 1953 – 15 March 1996) was a British sculptor, {{photographer}} and installation artist. In 1987, she {{became one of}} the first women artists to be nominated for the Turner Prize. Chadwick was known for [...] "challenging stereotypical perceptions of the body in elegant yet unconventional forms. [...] Her work draws from a range of sources, from myths to science, grappling with a plethora of unconventional, visceral materials that included chocolate, lambs tongues and rotting vegetable matter. Her skilled use of traditional fabrication methods and sophisticated technologies transform these unusual materials into complex installations. Maureen Paley noted that [...] "Helen was <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> craftsmanship—a constant fount of information". Binary oppositions was a strong theme in Chadwick's work; seductive/repulsive, male/female, organic/man-made. Her combinations [...] "emphasise yet simultaneously dissolve the contrasts between them". Her gender representations forge a sense of ambiguity and a disquieting sexuality blurring the boundaries of ourselves as singular and stable beings." ...|$|E

2500|$|Penny {{offers the}} words [...] "potato, bathroom, lust, honeymoon, and sex." [...] Penny reads Mr. Kirby's list first, with {{reactions}} of, respectively: [...] "steak, toothpaste, unlawful, trip, male." [...] Mrs. Kirby's list, however, causes much controversy. [...] "Starch" [...] is her response to potatoes, {{which is not}} that bad, but her response for [...] "bathroom" [...] is [...] "Mr. Kirby," [...] and she covers {{it up with the}} fact that Mr. Kirby {{spends a lot of time}} in there [...] "bathing and shaving". Her response to [...] "lust" [...] is [...] "human," [...] claiming it is a perfectly human emotion. Mr. Kirby disagrees, saying [...] "it is depraved." [...] "Honeymoon"'s reply is [...] "dull," [...] as Mrs. Kirby explains that there was [...] "nothing to do at night." [...] The shocker comes when Mrs. Kirby says her reply to [...] "sex" [...] was [...] "Wall Street". She at first claims she doesn't know what she meant by it, but once provoked she yells at Mr. Kirby [...] "You're <b>always</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Wall Street, even when--" [...] and then stops.|$|E
