5|$|Although the Dreamcast {{had a short}} {{lifespan}} {{and limited}} third-party support, reviewers have considered the console <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> time. Its library contains many games considered creative and innovative, including Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio and Shenmue, as well as high-quality ports from Sega's NAOMI arcade system board. The Dreamcast {{was also the first}} console to include a built-in modem for Internet support and online play.|$|E
25|$|The print, {{broadcast}} and online media of Burma (also known as Myanmar) has undergone strict censorship and regulation since the 1962 Burmese coup d'état. The constitution provides {{for freedom of}} speech and the press; however, the government prohibits the exercise of these rights in practice. Reporters Without Borders ranked Burma 174th out <b>of</b> 178 in <b>its</b> 2010 Press Freedom Index, <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> just Iran, Turkmenistan, North Korea, and Eritrea. In 2015, Burma moved up to 144th place, <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>its</b> ASEAN neighbours such as Singapore, as a result of political changes in the country.|$|R
50|$|Aided by William Daniels, Capra {{completed}} the film a full 80 days <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> schedule, <b>its</b> final production cost of $1.89 million well under the allotted budget.

5|$|The {{film was}} part of the {{confidential}} data stolen in the Sony Pictures hack incident; it was leaked onto peer-to-peer file sharing websites on November 27, 2014, over a month <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> scheduled release. Along with it came Fury and three other unreleased Sony Pictures films (Annie, Mr. Turner and To Write Love on Her Arms). Within three days of the leak, Still Alice had been downloaded by an estimated 103,832 unique IP addresses.|$|E
5|$|There were {{experimental}} test operations {{set up to}} see if {{the idea}} was feasible; however, the technology of electrical systems and power grid infrastructures were inadequate in the nineteenth-century to operate such a system. Another disadvantage was the possibility of power loss caused by wire breaks or electrical equipment failures – which often happened during storms. The nineteenth-century idea to replace the existing steam fire engines with electric ones was <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> time and never moved forward.|$|E

50|$|Malaysia {{declared}} {{its independence from}} Britain in 1957, and formed its current state in 1963. Since then, it has seen significant economic growth, {{a large part of}} which can be attributed to its forest industry. Malaysia's rapid rate of development has put it far <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> several <b>of</b> <b>its</b> neighbours, such as Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. This has largely been in part to <b>its</b> abundance <b>of</b> natural resources, which constitutes significant portions of the country's economic sector. Because of this large financial gain from logging, production has been high since initiation, and it was not until 1985 that consequences were first realised.|$|R

5|$|Another {{feature that}} was <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> {{time was the}} use of dynamic brakes, where some (or most) of the braking effect is created by running the {{traction}} motors in reverse as generators, and then dissipating the generated electrical power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, the heat was generated in the locomotive as opposed to the more typically roof-top open-air coolers seen on most modern locomotives. The resistors were themselves cooled by the water from the steam loop, heating it. This allowed the braking energy to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative braking.|$|E
5|$|From {{the moment}} Thriller was released, it set the {{standard}} for the music industry: artists, record labels, producers, marketers and even choreographers. The music video was <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> time and it is considered a monumental one—not only in Jackson's career, but also in the history of pop music. Epic Records' approach to creating a song and video that would appeal to the mass market ended up influencing the way that professionals now market and release their songs. John Landis's production of a mini-movie, rather than the usual short music video, would raise the bar for other directors and producers.|$|E
5|$|I-195 curves {{southeast}} and passes under the BWI Trail <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 170 (Aviation Boulevard), {{also known as}} the Airport Loop. The Airport Loop provides access to long-term parking lots, the consolidated rental car facility, hotels, cargo and general aviation facilities, and the BWI Rail Station. The circumferential highway also provides indirect access to I-97 for traffic heading to Annapolis or the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. At this interchange, I-195 ends and the roadway continues as MD 995A towards the entrance to BWI Airport.|$|E
500|$|Gunnersbury Triangle is a [...] Local {{nature reserve}} in the London boroughs of Ealing and Hounslow, {{immediately}} {{to the east of}} Gunnersbury.

It opened as a nature reserve in 1985.|$|R
50|$|Proponents of net {{neutrality}} regulations say network operators {{have continued to}} under-invest in infrastructure. However, according to Copenhagen Economics, U.S. investment in telecom infrastructure is 50 percent {{higher than in the}} European Union. As a share of GDP, the United States' broadband investment rate per GDP trails only the UK and South Korea slightly, but exceeds Japan, Canada, Italy, Germany, and France sizably. On broadband speed, Akamai reported that the US trails only South Korea and Japan among its major trading partners, and trails only Japan in the G-7 in both average peak connection speed and percentage of the population connection at 10 Mbit/s or higher, but are substantially <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>its</b> other major trading partners.|$|R

5|$|In Hancocks third {{weekend of}} July18, the film took top {{placement}} {{in the international}} box office a third time, grossing an estimated $44.8million from 8,286 screens across 71 territories. The film had beaten The Dark Knight, which premiered that weekend in 20 international markets. Hancock had tracked 32% internationally <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> performance in the United States and Canada. It had opened in four new markets for the weekend, ranking first in Spain with $8.6 million from 562 sites and first in Norway with $1 million from 60 sites.

5|$|The Liberian Air Force was {{formally}} dissolved in 2005 {{as part of}} the armed forces demobilization programme, though it had effectively ceased to exist during the civil war. For many years only the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) operated military aircraft in Liberia - Mi-8 transport and Mi-24 attack helicopters from Roberts International Airport with several subsidiary locations. With the reduction in strength of UNMIL <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> anticipated closure of operations in March 2018, these services were wound down.|$|E
5|$|The entire film {{received}} an advanced midnight screening on November 16, 2013 at the Shinjuku Wald 9 cinema in Shinjuku, Tokyo <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> November 23 release. During its release weekend, the film mostly attracted a young audience ranging from teenagers {{to those in}} their early thirties. Among this demographic, males were outnumbered by females {{at a ratio of}} 2:3 which suggested that the original game itself was mostly popular among women. In addition a significant number of patrons who were not familiar with the game were also present during the release weekend.|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change is}} an {{increasingly}} important consideration in the UAE. The growing impact of climate change has been particularly apparent through precipitation changes, rising sea levels, and more obvious climatic fluctuations such as harsher summers and cooler winters. According to a document (Climate Change Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation) produced by the Abu Dhabi Environment Agency in 2009, the UAE is already subject to extreme weather conditions â even small variations in temperature and precipitation could negatively affect the countryâs fragile natural resources and its strength to adapt. The uncertainty and unpredictability of climate change in the region, together with its nonquantifiable effects, have urged the UAE to push ahead in the sector <b>of</b> sustainability, <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>its</b> neighbours...|$|R
50|$|IIMC {{with its}} {{headquarters}} at Delhi also has five Regional Centres in Aizawl (Mizoram), Amravati (Maharashtra), Dhenkanal (Odisha), Jammu (J&K) and Kottyam (Kerala).

5|$|The {{first issue}} sold {{out of its}} first {{printing}} <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> March 14 release date. A second printing ordered for April 11, the same release date as issue #2, also sold out, with a third printing arriving in stores on April 25. The issue ultimately went through five printings. By August it had sold over 70,000 copies in various printings. As of 2016, the collected editions of the series outsell those of The Walking Dead, another successful Image comic that has greater public visibility through the television series adapted from it.|$|E
5|$|The {{same year}} Gaudí was {{consulted}} about {{the construction of}} a monumental train station for Barcelona (the future Estació de França). Gaudí suggested an iron structure {{in the form of a}} large suspended awning, a solution quite <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> time; perhaps for this reason, it put the head engineers off, and they declined Gaudí's offer. The last known projects by the architect are the chapel for the Colónia Calvet in Torelló, of 1923, and a pulpit for Valencia (the exact location is unknown), of 1924. From then on, Gaudí worked exclusively on the Sagrada Família until his death.|$|E
5|$|The season premiered at the Pacific Design Center on January 26, 2017, <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> FX {{debut on}} February 8. It ran for eight episodes, until March 29. The season {{received}} critical acclaim for its cast, particularly Stevens; Hawley's visuals and design; and the nonlinear, unreliable {{nature of the}} storytelling. Several critics did note that the latter aspects would not be for all viewers, and some criticized this as just {{the latest in a}} trend of series with unreliable narratives. Legion was renewed for a second season on March 15, 2017.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{publications}} {{increased by}} 308% between 2005 and 2014, {{primarily as a}} result of Thomson Reuters' decision to track a much larger number of Brazilian journals in its database between 2006 and 2008. Despite this artificial boost, the pace of growth has slowed since 2011. Moreover, in terms of publications per capita, the country trails both the more dynamic emerging market economies and advanced economies, even if it is <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>its</b> neighbours. When it comes to impact, Brazil has lost a lot of ground in the past decade. One possible cause may be the speed with which enrolment in higher education has expanded since the mid-1990s, especially as concerns students passing through the federal system of universities, some of which have resorted to hiring inexperienced faculty, including candidates without doctorates.|$|R
