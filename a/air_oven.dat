50|$|Nitric acid {{or forced}} <b>air</b> <b>oven</b> {{oxidation}} {{can also be}} used to dissolve iron from the electrowinning cathodes before smelting. Gravity concentrates can often contain high grinding steel contents, and so their removal using shaking tables or magnets is used before smelting.During smelting iron can be oxidized using nitre. Excessive use of nitre will corrode the smelting pot, increasing both maintenance costs and the risk of catastrophic leaks (known as run-aways, or holes in the pot through which the molten charge is lost).

40|$|Thermal {{aging of}} hydroxy-terminated polybutadiene/isophorone {{diisocyanate}} (HTPB/IPDI) -based polyurethane was studied {{as a function}} of NCO/OH ratio (1. 0 and 0. 85).

Correlation between equilibrium swelling ratio and elastic modulus, coupled with changes in FT-IR spectra, indicated oxidative cross-linking as the dominant mechanism for both molar ratios investigated.

50|$|Dry {{heat was}} the first method of {{sterilization}} and is a longer process than moist heat sterilization. The destruction of microorganisms {{through the use of}} dry heat is a gradual phenomenon. With longer exposure to lethal temperatures, the number of killed microorganisms increases. Forced ventilation of hot air can be used to increase the rate at which heat is transferred to an organism and reduce the temperature and amount of time needed to achieve sterility. At higher temperatures, shorter exposure times are required to kill organisms. This can reduce heat-induced damage to food products. The standard setting for a hot <b>air</b> <b>oven</b> is at least two hours at 160 °C. A rapid method heats air to 190 °C for 6 minutes for unwrapped objects and 12 minutes for wrapped objects.

5000|$|Hot <b>air</b> <b>ovens</b> are {{electrical}} devices which use dry heat to sterilize. They were originally developed by Pasteur. [...] Generally, {{they can be}} operated from 50 to 300 °C, using a thermostat to control the temperature.

There is also an air filled space in between to aid insulation. An air circulating fan helps in uniform distribution of the heat. These are fitted with the adjustable wire mesh plated trays or aluminium trays and may have an on/off rocker switch, as well as indicators and controls for temperature and holding time.
