In May 2008, under a court order, the EPA lowered its ozone standard from 80 nmol/mol to 75 nmol/mol. The move proved controversial, since the Agency's own scientists and advisory board had recommended lowering the standard to 60 nmol/mol. Many public health and environmental groups also supported the 60 nmol/mol standard, and the World Health Organization recommends 51 nmol/mol.|$|E

[...] The decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards that became the most divisive environmental debate of the decade. [...] There was a long and fierce internal discussion within the administration, with opposition from the president's economic advisers echoing strong objections from some industry groups who said {{the costs of the}} new standards would far outweigh any benefits and that Browner had exaggerated the degree of certainty behind the EPA's scientific reviews on the matter. [...] Over eighty environmental and health groups, who had grown quite frustrated with the administration's preference for minimal-cost incremental actions in the area, pressured Vice President Gore to take a stand on the matter, but he remained silent. [...] Browner's adamant defense in favor of the new standards was conducted almost single-handedly, in private meetings, Congressional testimony, and public debate, and had come {{in the face of a}} silence from the White House that had put at risk her standing within the administration. [...] Some within the administration objected to her unwillingness to modify her stance and even suggested she be fired for insubordination. [...] Ultimately, Gore lent behind-the-scenes support in favor of the new regulations, which was a key factor in Clinton's final decision in Browner's favor. [...] Overall, the New York Times termed Browner's actions [...] "a remarkable piece of bureaucratic bravura" [...] and Time magazine labelled Browner the [...] "Queen of Clean Air".

The investigations were carried out during the spring–winter and the spring seasons using two types of the electronic nose instrument. The field olfactometers were employed to determine the mean odour concentration, which was from 2. 1 to 32. 2 ou/m 3 depending on the measurement site and season of the year. In the case of the investigation performed with two types of the electronic nose, a classification of the <b>ambient</b> <b>air</b> samples with respect to the collection site was carried out using the k-nearest neighbours (kNN) algorithm supported with the cross-validation method. Correct classification of the <b>ambient</b> <b>air</b> samples collected during the spring–winter season was at the level from 71. 9 % to 87. 5 % and from 84. 4 % to 94. 8 % for the samples collected during the spring season depending on the electronic nose type utilized in the studies. It was also revealed that the kNN algorithm applied for classification of the samples exhibited better discrimination abilities than the algorithms of the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and quadratic discriminant function (QDA) type.
