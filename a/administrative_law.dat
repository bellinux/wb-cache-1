5|$|In Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), the Court of Appeal {{stated that}} {{fundamental}} rules of natural justice {{embodied in the}} concept of law in constitutional provisions such as Articles 9(1) and 12(1) are the same in nature and function as common law rules of natural justice in <b>administrative</b> <b>law,</b> except that they operate at different levels of the legal order. The former invalidate legislation on the ground of unconstitutionality and can only be altered by amending the Constitution, while the latter invalidate administrative decisions on the ground of <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> principles and can be abrogated or disapplied by ordinary legislation.|$|E
5|$|The {{remedies}} {{available in}} Singapore <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> are the prerogative orders – the mandatory order (formerly known as mandamus), prohibiting order (prohibition), quashing order (certiorari), and order for review of detention (habeas corpus) – and the declaration, {{a form of}} equitable remedy. In Singapore, <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> is the branch of law that enables a person to challenge an exercise of power by {{the executive branch of}} the Government. The challenge is carried out by applying to the High Court for judicial review. The Court's power to review a law or an official act of a government official is part of its supervisory jurisdiction, and at its fullest may involve quashing an action or decision and ordering that it be redone or remade.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In the post-reformation era in Indonesia {{there is}} a trend of {{increasing}} productivity in legislations {{and it can be}} seen from the various <b>Administrative</b> <b>Laws</b> despite not in a consistent growth. <b>Administrative</b> <b>laws</b> are all regulations that govern the nation to execute their duties and obligations as public and state servants. For identify whether a regulation belongs to <b>administrative</b> <b>laws</b> or not there are at least two criterions the first is title approach and the second is content approach. This research has chosen Law Number 8 Year 2012 as an object of study considering that the law was passed in the post-reformation era which is regulating general election as a very central point of democracy and as an indicator of a democratic state. Functionalization of criminal sanctions in <b>administrative</b> <b>laws</b> basically is to combining two legal systems and disciplines of <b>administrative</b> <b>laws</b> and criminal laws has delivered problems in their implementation but all of them are ignored without any solution. Criminal sanctions that are essentially ultimum remedium have changed to a substantial coercive tool that in the end has weakened the criminal sanctions themselves in their practical implementations. Some of un-uniformities of criminal sanction system are that there are laws implementing special straft minima minimum penalty there are laws using straft maxima maximum penalty there are laws using special cumulative penalties and incisive cumulative penalties and there are laws using double track system. Any development of law that deviates away from its principles and theories will push its legal implementation away from its true direction and in the end of the day it will depart far away from the essence of legal development...|$|R
50|$|In 1990, the Administrative Supervision Regulations (行政检查条例) and the Administrative Reconsideration Regulations (行政复议条例) were passed. The 1993 State Civil Servant Provisional Regulations (国家公务员暂行条例) {{changed the}} way {{government}} officials were selected and promoted, requiring that they pass exams and yearly appraisals, and introduced a rotation system. The three regulations have been amended and upgraded into laws. In 1994, the State Compensation Law (国家赔偿法) was passed, followed by the <b>Administrative</b> Penalties <b>Law</b> (行政处罚法) in 1996. <b>Administrative</b> Compulsory <b>Law</b> was enforced in 2012. <b>Administrative</b> Litigation <b>Law</b> was amended in 2014.

5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights. In <b>administrative</b> <b>law,</b> a legitimate expectation generally arises when {{there has been}} a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual. To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness. The {{doctrine of}} legitimate expectation as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the individual has a legitimate expectation to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right. The recognition of substantive legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a free-standing proportionality approach, which has been said not to apply in <b>administrative</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
5|$|Threshold {{issues are}} legal {{requirements}} in Singapore <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> {{that must be}} satisfied by applicants before their claims for judicial review of acts or decisions of public authorities {{can be dealt with}} by the High Court. These include showing that they have standing (locus standi) to bring cases, and that the matters are amenable to judicial review and justiciable by the Court.|$|E
5|$|Under <b>administrative</b> <b>law,</b> {{judicial}} review {{is an exercise}} in which the High Court scrutinizes the executive's decisions and orders to ensure that they conform with the law. If the decisions and orders are not authorized by statute or if they have been made in contravention of <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> principles, the Court can invalidate them. Similarly, if any exercise of power by an executive body contravenes the Constitution, the Court has a duty to declare it invalid. With regards to the ISA and the powers to detain without trial, the scope of {{judicial review}} was subject to a succession of changes between 1988 and 1990. These changes revolved around the issue of whether the discretion of the President and the Home Affairs Minister should be assessed objectively or subjectively. During that period, the scope of judicial review was expanded by common law developments but was subsequently curtailed by legislative and constitutional amendments.|$|E

5|$|Coughlan {{has been}} criticized for {{allowing}} the doctrine of proportionality to affect <b>administrative</b> <b>law,</b> as the court has to judge the merits of a case when granting a review on grounds of substantive legitimate expectation and, in a sense, usurp the discretion of the executive branch of government. This is arguably inconsistent with the court's traditional role in judicial review which is to avoid examining the merits of administrative decisions and only scrutinize them for compliance with the law.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the {{interest}} that the applicant seeks to represent, standing {{can be categorized}} as either private or public standing. Applicants must establish they have private standing if they seek to represent personal interests. In contrast, an applicant who seeks to represent {{the interest}}s of a larger group or {{the public at large}} must establish he or she has public or representative standing. Where private standing is concerned, the Singapore courts have not yet directly addressed the issue of the standing required to obtain a declaration in an <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> case, but where constitutional claims are concerned the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist: (1) the applicant must have a real interest in bringing the case, (2) there must be a real controversy between the parties to the case, and (3) a personal right possessed by the applicant must have been violated. The Court also suggested that the same test applied to applications for prerogative orders. The legal position on public standing in <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> cases is indeterminate as, to date, no applicant has sought to rely on public standing to obtain leave for judicial review. In constitutional law cases, the Court has drawn a distinction between public and private rights, and held that people will not have standing to vindicate public rights unless they have suffered special damage and have genuine private interests to protect or further.|$|E
5|$|Errors as to {{precedent}} facts, {{sometimes called}} jurisdictional facts, in Singapore <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> are errors committed by public authorities concerning facts that must objectively exist or not exist before the authorities {{have the power}} to take actions or make decisions under legislation. If an error concerning a precedent fact is made, the statutory power has not been exercised lawfully and may be quashed by the High Court if judicial review is applied for by an aggrieved person. The willingness of the Court to review such errors of fact is an exception to the general rule that the Court only reviews errors of law.|$|E

5|$|Fettering of {{discretion}} {{by a public}} authority {{is one of the}} grounds of judicial review in Singapore <b>administrative</b> <b>law.</b> It is regarded as a form of illegality. An applicant may challenge a decision by an authority on the basis that it has either rigidly adhered to a policy it has formulated, or has wrongfully delegated the exercise of its statutory powers to another body. If the High Court finds that a decision-maker has fettered its discretion, it may hold the decision to be ultra vires – beyond the decision-maker's powers – and grant the applicant a suitable remedy such as a quashing order to invalidate the decision.|$|E
5|$|In Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General (2011), the {{applicant}} sought a declaration that section 377A of the Penal Code was unconstitutional. The High Court stated {{that a person}} who is asserting an infringement of a constitutional liberty must establish that he or she has not merely a sufficient interest but a substantial interest in the matter, that is, he or she must be alleging a violation of a fundamental liberty. The Court did not discuss the issue of standing in the context of <b>administrative</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E

The grounds of review available under this heading include the authority acting in bad faith, acting {{on the basis of}} no evidence or insufficient evidence, making an error of material fact, failing to take into account relevant considerations or taking into account irrelevant ones, acting for an improper purpose, fettering one's discretion, and not fulfilling a person's substantive legitimate expectations.|$|E

5|$|The Chief Justice of Singapore, Chan Sek Keong, {{suggested}} extrajudicially {{during a}} 2010 lecture that Singapore courts may not apply the sufficient interest test {{with the same}} rigour as the UK courts. A more stringent application of the sufficient interest test would be {{in line with the}} green-light approach that the courts adopt in <b>administrative</b> <b>law.</b> Under this approach, the Government commits itself to good administrative practices while the courts play a supporting role by articulating clear rules for the executive to adhere to. Accordingly, the courts may adopt a more discriminating standing test to discourage litigation that will unnecessarily curtail the executive's ability to carry out good governance.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{also held}} that the orders were neither irrational nor disproportionate. The order banning all WTBTS {{publications}} was reasonable {{as it would be}} administratively impossible to monitor any order other than a blanket ban. As for the deregistration order, the Court accepted that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service prejudiced national security, and was thus appropriately issued in the interest of public order. The Court noted that Singapore's <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> does not recognize proportionality as a distinct ground of judicial review.|$|E

40|$|Similar to all {{the other}} {{prefecture}}s in Transylvania, Banat, Crisana, Satmar and Maramureş, the Cluj County prefecture worked, until January 1, 1926, {{within the framework of the}} Hungarian <b>administrative</b> <b>laws</b> in force on December 1 st, 1918. Therefore, after six years of Austro-Hungarian legal continuity, the Cluj prefecture took the shape and size imposed successively by institutional models, by laws and regulations on internal organization, but also by the will, sometimes discretionary, of the 15 prefects with various professions and personal political ambitions who represented the government here. We will limit ourselves here to study the 1923 - 1938 interval, since it corresponds to the period when the main <b>administrative</b> <b>laws</b> were adopted (1925, 1929, 1936, 1938), then the Constitution and, importantly, the ﬁrst legal document that attests a change in the de facto uniﬁed administration, namely the law on civil service status. The year 1938 also ended the period during which, for two decades, the 25 Romanian governments implemented their own models of running the administration. The <b>administrative</b> <b>laws</b> of 1925, 1929 and 1936 were followed by reorganization of structures within the county of Cluj prefecture, but brought no major changes of content. For a more efﬁcient functioning of the prefecture, the institution of delegation was often used, by means of which the prefect delegated his county duties to the deputy prefect.
