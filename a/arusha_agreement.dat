Organized by the United States, France and the Organisation of African Unity, the talks began on July 12, 1992, and lasted until June 24, 1993, with a final week-long meeting in Rwanda, July 19 to July 25, 1993.|$|R

40|$|The Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement for Burundi (<b>Arusha</b> <b>Agreement)</b> {{was signed}} in 2000 {{to bring an end}} to an ethnically {{motivated}} civil war and promote national reconciliation and transitional justice.

In addition, the ruling party s decision to adopt a controversial interpretation of the Constitution and nominate the current President for the third term in April 2015 is causing disturbances on the streets and forces the international community to witness how the political elite s wish to stay in power could drive the country into yet another civil war. In this interdisciplinary comparative legal analysis, I will answer the following research question: In the light of Burundi s political and socio-economic realities in 2015, what are the achievements and shortcomings in the implementation of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement for Burundi signed in August 2000, and how can the process of national reconciliation be moved forward?

In 2005, Burundians elected Pierre Nkurunziza, a Hutu, as President of the country, reinforcing the conditions of the peace agreement. Following the end of the conflict, Burundi experienced a large wave of return of its displaced population. Estimates suggest that over 500, 000 Burundians returned from Tanzania between 2000 and 2015 (Fransen 2015). This is a considerable number for a country that had a population of only 6.7 million in 2000.

40|$|In {{order to}} put an end to a lengthy process of {{political}} transition, involving years of political violence, Burundi has introduced a system of power-sharing that is largely consociational. This article analyses the political and institutional reforms introduced by the <b>Arusha</b> Peace <b>Agreement</b> signed in 2000 and the Constitution of 2005 in the light of the new political landscape resulting from the 2005 elections. These have been primarily marked by the victory of the former rebellion CNDD-FDD and the election of its leader Pierre Nkurunziza as the new president. Power-sharing in Burundi is strongly based on consociational pillars, such as the grand coalition, proportionality, veto rights and elite cooperation. Although the literature on consociationalism allows for some optimism that Burundi will benefit from a period of political stability, several problems and challenges remain. These are, amongst other things, related to the largely externally driven nature of Burundi’s power-sharing arrangement. ...|$|R

40|$|This study compares and {{analyses}} South Africa’s mediation efforts in Burundi from 1999 -present, and Côte d’Ivoire from 2004 - 2006. A thorough {{study of the}} two conflicts reveals that the conflict in Burundi was far more intractable than that in Côte d’Ivoire, with very unique factors contributing to the conflict: a high population density coupled with land scarcity, in a bifurcated dual community with a Hutu majority and a Tutsi minority. The Tutsi minority had ruled over the Hutu majority since pre-colonial times. The <b>Arusha</b> <b>Agreement</b> for the Reconciliation of Burundi (2000) attempted to redress these historical circumstances by introducing proportional ethnic quotas. While enabling majority rule, these however, ensured the former minority rulers retain substantial power through the agreed proportional formulae. A significant challenge with which the South African mediators were faced was that the major Hutu rebel groups, the CNDD-FDD and the Paliphehutu-FNL remained outside the peace process until 2003 and 2008 respectively. The conflict in Côte d’Ivoire was influenced more strongly by economic factors. Once Ivoirité was introduced in 1964, based on the patrimonialism of President Felix Houphouët-Boigny’s one party rule, groups such as migrants, northerners and Muslims formed an alliance of the excluded and rebelled against the Ivoirité government. This continues to contribute significantly to {{the conflict in the}} country. Although the Côte d’Ivoirian conflict was far more negotiable, bad faith {{between the government and the}} rebels, agreements that did not address the root causes of the conflict as well as a proliferation of external mediators resulted in a protracted peace process that has not been completely resolved. The most significant contribution by South Africa may have been President Mbeki’s determination on Article 35 of the Côte d’Ivoirian constitution that excluded personalities who did not meet the requirements of Ivoirité from standing for public office. South Africa had, as a newly democratized country prioritized conflict and post conflict resolution as a pre-cursor to promoting development on the continent, which it sees as twin pillars of the African agenda for African renewal. This study aims to investigate how it fared in particularly these two endevours as it exported the South African model of conflict resolution based on its own transformation and which outcomes can be considered more successful. In assessing how South Africa fared, the outcomes of its intervention in each of the case studies, is weighed against criteria for successful conflict resolution determined by John Stremlau and William Zartman.

40|$|Burundi {{may soon}} reach yet another {{crossroads}} in its tumultuous history {{and on its}} path towards transitional justice. A contentious draft law for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission awaits approval by the country’s National Assembly, which has raised a number of concerns about {{the independence of the}} eventual commission, the likelihood of popular participation in the process and the prospects for criminal justice. But as this practice note seeks to demonstrate, the international community in Burundi may in fact be contributing to the instrumentalisation of the process. The note highlights how the discourse of the international community may partially facilitate a certain duplicity among influential figures within the current government, particularly with respect to compliance with stipulations under the 2000 <b>Arusha</b> Peace <b>Agreement.</b> Two common rationalisations in particular are explained that have seemingly emerged among the international community with respect to transitional justice and that {{are at the heart of}} this instrumentalisation: outside imposition and a lack of influence.

Yet, this paper highlights the ambiguous outcomes of such reforms in situation of institutional multiplicity. Fieldwork in Ngozi province in northern Burundi points out how land-related reforms such as decentralising the administrative authority at the communal and hill levels and policy reforms in the formalisation of property rights have positive impacts in terms of dealing with specific land disputes and fostering local feelings of tenure security {{in the aftermath of}} the 2000 <b>Arusha</b> Peace <b>Agreement.</b> However, {{land governance}} reforms have also fuelled the proliferation of land governing institutions and fostered confusion among state and non-state authorities about which rules to apply and their roles in mitigating tensions over landownership and enforcing property rights.

In the years after genocide and ethnic cleansing both countries employed in different strategies for rehabilitating ethnic groups and mitigating ethnic tensions.

In Bosnia international actors have attempted to reconcile ethnic groups by dividing power in the country’s most important political institutions along ethnic lines. Though Bosnia has remained peaceful in the last two decades, cooperation between the Bosniak, Croat and Serbian ethnic minorities has proven difficult. The Office of the High Representative has used his ‘Bonn powers’ frequently to pass legislation or remove politicians that frustrated the peace process. In Rwanda the story is entirely different. The <b>Arusha</b> Peace <b>Agreement</b> of 1993 entailed democratization and power sharing between the Hutu government and Tutsi rebels, the Rwandese Patriotic Front (RPF). However, in a society in civil war, where ethnic discrimination was prevalent, power sharing catalysed a genocide. Now the RPF are in firm control of Rwanda’s political institutions.
