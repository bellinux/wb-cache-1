5|$|The first udema Gamla was c. 30m (100ft) {{long and}} with <b>a</b> <b>draft</b> <b>of</b> 1.5m (5ft). The later udemas,Torborg and Ingeborg, carried a mizzen mast, and were both longer and wider, 37m (121ft) long and almost 9m (29ft) wide with <b>a</b> <b>draft</b> <b>of</b> just over 3m (10ft). Torborg, built in 1772, had three {{additional}} 12-pounders, eleven in the centerline {{and two in}} the bow facing forwards, housed under a decked superstructure with gun ports, but with the rowing seats left undecked. This arrangement proved to be less successful with reports about problems with splintering and lingering gunpowder smoke. She was also a poor sailer and slow under oars, earning the udema a poor reputation.|$|E

5|$|In January 1941, {{with the}} threat of {{invasion}} of England reduced, it was decided to send the 2nd AIF units there to the Middle East and the battalion arrived in Egypt in March 1941. Following this the battalion moved to Palestine where it undertook further training and received <b>a</b> <b>draft</b> <b>of</b> reinforcements which enabled it to raise a fourth company in order to bring it up to establishment. Having been transferred to the 7th Division, the battalion took up defensive positions around Mersa Matruh before taking part in the Syria-Lebanon campaign, during which it took part in several battles.|$|E

5|$|The 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt, {{commonly}} referred to as the August Coup, was prompted by the slow disintegration of the Soviet Union that resulted from Gorbachev's reform policy and Yeltsin's drive towards an independent Russia. The New Union Treaty being prepared called for further decentralisation of power to the republics, which weakened the government's already tenuous hold on the economy. Pavlov received <b>a</b> <b>draft</b> <b>of</b> the New Union Treaty on 12 August at a Security Council meeting and managed to get it published in the Moscow News on 14 August.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} {{to undertake a}} cross-channel invasion of continental Europe {{within the next year}} was taken at the Trident Conference, held in Washington in May 1943. The Allies initially planned to launch the invasion on May 1, 1944, and <b>a</b> <b>draft</b> <b>of</b> the plan was accepted at the Quebec Conference in August 1943. General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed commander of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF).

5|$|The {{first four}} M-class shipsM, N, O, and Pwere 178 meters long at the waterline, and 183 meters long overall. They had {{a beam of}} 17 meters and <b>a</b> <b>draft</b> <b>of</b> 5.42 meters standard, 7.25 meters forward, and 6.03 meters aft. The ships had a {{designed}} displacement of 8,500metric tons, but displaced 7,800tons at standard load and 10,400tons fully laden. The ships had a crew of 28 officers and 892 men. They were designed to carry one picket boat, a barge, a launch, and two cutters.|$|E

5|$|Van Rensselaer {{was quick}} {{to take part in}} the new endeavor: on January 13, 1629, he sent {{notification}} to the Directors of the Company that he, in conjunction with fellow Company members Samuel Godyn and Samuel Blommaert, had sent Gillis Houset and Jacob Jansz Cuyper to determine satisfactory locations for settlement. This took place even before the Charter was ratified, but was done in accordance with <b>a</b> <b>draft</b> <b>of</b> the Charter from March 28, 1628.|$|E
5|$|A {{short period}} of home leave followed, before the battalion's {{personnel}} concentrated at Royal Park for a march through Melbourne. <b>A</b> <b>draft</b> <b>of</b> reinforcements arrived around this time also, incorporating men from New South Wales and several others states. In mid-September, the battalion moved to Greta, New South Wales, travelling by rail through Shepparton, Tocumwal and Newcastle. A brief period of training was undertaken there, during which the battalion's khaki uniforms were dyed green. During this time, the battalion was re-organised and converted to the jungle establishment; {{as part of this}} process its authorised strength was reduced to around 800 personnel of all ranks. The situation in the Pacific had deteriorated dramatically, and the Australian forces holding out against the Japanese in New Guinea were hard-pressed and desperately in need of reinforcement. Thus in early October 1942, not more than two months after returning to Australia, the 2/5th moved to Brisbane, Queensland, where it deployed to Milne Bay, which had only recently been held {{in the face of a}} Japanese landing, aboard the Dutch transport Maetsuyker.|$|E
5|$|At an {{appearance}} at the Armadillo World Headquarters, a music venue in Austin, Texas, Nelson met publisher and screenwriter William D. Wittliff. Because {{of the success of}} the album, Wittliff decided to write a script for Nelson based on the story of the Red Headed Stranger. In 1979 Wittliff finished <b>a</b> <b>draft</b> <b>of</b> the project, which was turned over to Universal Studios. The studio budgeted the film at $14 million and sent the script to Robert Redford, who turned it down. The movie project was tabled, and Wittliff and Nelson had to buy the script back from Universal. The script then went to HBO, who assigned the project a budget of $5 million, but this project was not completed either. Finally, Nelson and Wittliff decided to finance the film themselves. Nelson portrayed the role of the stranger, and the movie was released in 1986.|$|E

5|$|Despite these efforts, on 21February {{it became}} clear just how {{fundamentally}} opposed the groups were. Philip Nye, one of the dissenting brethren, asserted in a speech that a presbytery set over local congregations would become as powerful as the state and was dangerous to the commonwealth, provoking vigorous opposition from presbyterians. The next day, the Assembly finally began to establish a prescription for presbyterian government. Owing to a strong belief in {{the unity of the}} church, the Assembly continued to try to find ways to reconcile the dissenting brethren with the majority throughout 1644, including the establishment of a special committee for that purpose in March. However, on 15November, the dissenting brethren presented their reasons for disagreement {{with the rest of the}} Assembly to Parliament, and on 11December the majority submitted <b>a</b> <b>draft</b> <b>of</b> a presbyterian form of government.|$|E
5|$|Disguised as a habitué of {{bars and}} taverns, he {{gathered}} {{much of that}} evidence himself. For all the barriers placed to prosecution, and separating the branches of government, English law still had ancient and formidable customs of authority.

Then he conducted more than 100 cross-examinations of witnesses, informers, and suspects between June 1698 and Christmas 1699. Newton successfully prosecuted 28 coiners.|$|E
5|$|Historically {{influenced}} by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki. However, {{since the late}} 19th century the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. For example, in 1896, the Japanese government established a civil code based on <b>a</b> <b>draft</b> <b>of</b> the German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch; with the code remaining in effect with post–World War II modifications. Statutory law originates in Japan's legislature and has the rubber stamp of the Emperor. Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.|$|E
