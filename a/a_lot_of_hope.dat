But there’s <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> and faith in this wounded voice: Carey keeps, with {{touching}} conviction, {{a firm grip on}} the idea that some higher, divine intelligence out there loves her, even if nobody else does; even if she is lost to herself. It comes across emotionally, because her heart is fully in it — Mimi has been beaten, humiliated, heartbroken; joys have been slapped out of her hands quicker than she could appreciate them. She’s deeply confused, and God, she really needs help. Hell: We’ve all been there.|$|E
500|$|The film {{switches}} the infertility from male {{to female}} but never explains its cause: environmental destruction and divine punishment are considered. This unanswered question (and {{others in the}} film) {{have been attributed to}} Cuarón's dislike for expository film: [...] "There's a kind of cinema I detest, which is a cinema that is about exposition and explanations... It's become now what I call a medium for lazy readers... Cinema is a hostage of narrative. [...] And I'm very good at narrative as a hostage of cinema." [...] Cuarón's disdain for back-story and exposition led him to use the concept of female infertility as a [...] "metaphor for the fading sense of hope". [...] The [...] "almost mythical" [...] Human Project is turned into a [...] "metaphor for the possibility of the evolution of the human spirit, the evolution of human understanding." [...] Without dictating how the audience should feel {{by the end of the}} film, Cuarón encourages viewers to come to their own conclusions about the sense of hope depicted in the final scenes: [...] "We wanted the end to be a glimpse of a possibility of hope, for the audience to invest their own sense of hope into that ending. So if you're a hopeful person you'll see <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope,</b> and if you're a bleak person you'll see a complete hopelessness at the end." ...|$|E

Jeffrey Hyatt of Screencrave noted that the episode was similar in tone to the season eight finale, [...] "Free Family Portrait Studio", but that [...] "the addition of Lacy and Duke pay quick dividends as the opener provides flashes of comedy moxie, while helping wash away painful memories of last season." [...] David Hinckley of the New York Daily News awarded the episode three stars out of five and wrote that [...] "The deadpan goofiness remains fresh enough to keep fans interested" [...] and that [...] "the fact that this whole drama doesn't feel new and shiny anymore isn't anyone's fault. ... All The Office needs to do now is march out proudly random, zany and off-center." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall, however, was critical of the episode's humor, noting that it [...] "didn't give me <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> for a last-minute resurgence".

A high sensitivity of multiple myeloma to proteasome inhibition is probably related to extensive production immunoglobulins by the cancer cells.

40|$|The East European {{high-speed}} rail started in June 2007. It modifies the French and European transportation map and {{the accessibility of}} the beneficiary cities. Economic actors in these cities do expect <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> positive effects: economic dynamism, new firms and population arrival, development of office & corporate real estate programs around the central station, tourism expansion and so on.

In fact, several researches show that in the field of economic dynamism, no significant effects result from infrastructures alone. (Bonnafous et Plassard, 1974, Plassard, 1977, Offner, 1993, Vickerman, 1991, Bazin, Beckerich et Delaplace, 2006, Blanquart et Delaplace, 2009). It doesn't mean that they don't contribute to new dynamics for these territories, but they aren't sufficient (Troin, 1997). Nevertheless, in some areas, there is local economic dynamic linked to an HSR arrival. These dynamics perpetuate the myth among the politicians that HSR can contribute to local development. Consequently this myth is still very present in political speeches. The aim of the paper is present a review of all the literature, the academic literature but also the political speeches and reports to identify the reasons why such a gap exists between scientific knowledge and these political speeches. We argue that we must to produce scientific knowledge allowing to identify the necessary conditions for a HSR to contribute to a local economic development. By analyzing the arrival of a High-Speed Rail Service (HSRS) in a territory as a service innovation (Delaplace, 2009) that can give birth to complementary service innovations, we will show that the collective appropriation of these innovations is central to generating positive effects...|$|R
