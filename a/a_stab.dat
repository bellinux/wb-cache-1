5|$|Traumatic {{pneumothorax}} {{most commonly}} {{occurs when the}} chest wall is pierced, such as when <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> wound or gunshot wound allows air to enter the pleural space, or because some other mechanical injury to the lung compromises {{the integrity of the}} involved structures. Traumatic pneumothoraces have been found to occur in up to half of all cases of chest trauma, with only rib fractures being more common in this group. The pneumothorax can be occult (not readily apparent) in half of these cases, but may enlarge - particularly if mechanical ventilation is required. They are also encountered in patients already receiving mechanical ventilation for some other reason.|$|E
5|$|Fighting enemies, {{which appear}} {{in both the}} overworld and dungeons, relies on Link's use of his sword and shield. Link's sword {{movements}} are mapped to the direction the Wii Remote is flicked by the player, and other moves include a forward thrust and <b>a</b> <b>stab.</b> Enemy movements are designed to anticipate and block Link's combat movements. By raising the Wii Remote, the sword gathers energy which can be unleashed in a Skyward Strike. Skyward Strikes are also used to trigger environmental elements such as magical switches. The shield is controlled with the Nunchuck: when the shield is raised, {{it can be used}} to reflect attacks. Spin attacks and Finishing Blows are activated by swinging both the Wii Remote and Nunchuck. Link's health is represented with Hearts, with Link taking damage whenever he is hit: if he loses all Hearts, the game ends.|$|E

5|$|An army of Kull (Urgals who {{can grow}} up to 8 feet) reach Eragon right outside the Varden's entrance, but are driven off {{with the help of}} the Varden, who escort Eragon, Saphira, Murtagh, and Arya to Farthen Dûr the {{mountain}} hideout of the varden. When they arrive in Farthen Dûr, Eragon is led to the leader of the Varden, Ajihad. Ajihad imprisons Murtagh after he refuses to allow his mind to be read to determine if he is a friend or a foe to the Varden. Eragon is told by Ajihad that Durza was not destroyed by Murtagh's arrow, because the only way to kill a Shade is with <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> through the heart. Orik, nephew of the dwarf King Hrothgar, is appointed as Eragon and Saphira's guide. Orik shows them a place to stay and introduces them to Hrothgar. Eragon also meets Ajihad's daughter, Nasuada, and Ajihad's right-hand man, Jörmundur. He also runs into Angela and Solembum, who have arrived in Tronjheim, and visits Murtagh in his prison. He is tested by two magicians, The Twins, as well as Arya.|$|E
5|$|Populations from Los Baños {{and from}} Sagada, {{both in the}} Philippines, have {{slightly}} different hunting tactics, and Los Baños has some very dangerous prey spiders. In laboratory tests, Los Baños P. labiatas rely more on trial and error than Sagada P. labiatas in finding ways to vibrate the prey's web and thus lure or distract the prey. Around Los Baños the web-building Scytodes pallida, which preys on jumping spiders, is very abundant. All members of the genus Scytodes spit a sticky gum on prey and potential threats, and this can immobilise a Portia {{long enough for the}} Scytodes to wrap the Portia in silk and then bite it. Around Los Baños, P. labiata instinctively detours round the back of S. pallida that is not carrying eggs while with plucking the web {{in a way that makes}} S. pallida believe the threat is in front of it. P. labiata prefers to stalk a female S. pallida carrying eggs, as then S. pallida is reluctant to drop the eggs in order to spit, and in this case P. labiata sometimes uses a direct attack. In areas where S. pallida is absent, the local members of P. labiata do not use this combination of plucking other spiders' webs to deceive the prey and detouring for <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> in the back.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>stabbing</b> is {{penetration}} {{with a sharp}} or pointed object {{at close}} range. Stab connotes purposeful action, as by an assassin or murderer, {{but it is also}} possible to accidentally stab oneself or others. Stabbing differs from slashing or cutting in that the motion of the object used in <b>a</b> <b>stabbing</b> generally moves perpendicular to and directly into the victim's body, rather than being drawn across it.|$|R

25|$|The surgeon effects <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> {{incision}} {{just above}} the lateral aspect of the inframammary fold (IMF), piercing the skin 2-cm above the inframammary fold, in the midline. The pre-tunnelling is performed with the blunt-tip, multi-perforation cannula used to infiltrate the anaesthetic solution to the breast tissues. A blunt-tip, 4-mm cannula, connected either to a medical-grade vacuum pump or to a syringe, is used to aspirate (suck) the adipose fat. The cannula is maneuvered laterally (in fanning movements), beginning in the deep plane of the breast and concluding in the superficial plane of the breast; the adipose fat sucked from the breast is a yellow, fatty, bloodless fluid; the liposuction concludes upon drawing the required volume of fat, or when the fat becomes bloody.|$|E
25|$|Afternoon {{hearing on}} the second day started by testimonies of pathologists. The {{youngest}} of the victims was incapacitated by a hit into the head with a blunt object, most probably stone found by police, and subsequently stabbed multiple times, dying due to cut throat. His father suffered 29 stab and slash wounds, including those conducted with an ax. Neither of the two victims could have been saved even if provided with immediate aid and both died within a minute. The older son was murdered while lying in his bed, also suffering numerous stab and slash wounds into head and neck. His mother suffered 29 stab wounds and died most probably after several minutes due to <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> wound into the neck; one of the stab wounds however hit her brain thus probably instantly incapacitating her.|$|E

25|$|MGM {{had bought}} the film rights to Clare Boothe Luce's 1936 smash Broadway hit The Women in 1937. Many writers had, unsuccessfully, taken <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> at a {{screenplay}} version. The studio handed it to Loos and veteran scriptwriter Jane Murfin, and three weeks later Loos handed Cukor a script that he loved. Unfortunately the censorship board did not. They insisted on changing more than 80 lines, and the film {{had to go into}} production. Loos was apprehensive, but Cukor insisted she do the changes on set, among his all-star bevy of leading ladies. Loos made immediate friends with Paulette Goddard, who was surprisingly well-read. She also had Aldous and Maria Huxley as houseguests, and encouraged Huxley to stay in California and continue to write there. When World War II began in September 1939, Loos convinced Huxley that it would be safer for his family if they stayed in the United States rather than returning to England, and she got him a job adapting screenplays at MGM.|$|E
25|$|The band's origins can {{be traced}} to 1981, in Bradford, Yorkshire, where vocalist and {{songwriter}} Ian Astbury formed a band called Southern Death Cult. The name was chosen with a double meaning, and was derived from the 14th century Native American religion, the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex or Southern Death Cult as it was sometimes known, from the Mississippi delta area, but it was also <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> at what the band viewed was the centralisation of power in Southern England (including that of the music industry); there has long been a perceived notion of a North-South divide based on social, historic and economic reasons. Astbury was joined by Buzz Burrows (guitar), Barry Jepson (bass) and Aki Nawaz Qureshi (drums); they performed their first show at the Queen's Hall in their hometown of Bradford on 29 October 1981. The band were at the forefront of an emerging style of music, in the form of post-punk and gothic rock (then known as positive-punk), they achieved critical acclaim from the press and music fans.|$|E
25|$|All viperids have {{a pair of}} {{relatively}} long solenoglyphous (hollow) fangs {{that are used to}} inject venom from glands located towards the rear of the upper jaws, just behind the eyes. Each of the two fangs is {{at the front of the}} mouth on a short maxillary bone that can rotate back and forth. When not in use, the fangs fold back against the roof of the mouth and are enclosed in a membranous sheath. The left and right fangs can be rotated together or independently. During a strike, the mouth can open nearly 180° and the maxilla rotates forward, erecting the fangs as late as possible so that the fangs do not become damaged, as they are brittle. The jaws close upon impact and the muscular sheaths encapsulating the venom glands contract, injecting the venom as the fangs penetrate the target. This action is very fast; in defensive strikes, it will be more <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> than a bite. Viperids use this mechanism primarily for immobilization and digestion of prey. Secondarily, it is used for self-defence, though in cases with nonprey, such as humans, they may give a dry bite (not inject any venom). A dry bite allows the snake to conserve their precious reserve of venom, because once it has been depleted, it takes time to replenish, leaving the snake vulnerable.|$|E
