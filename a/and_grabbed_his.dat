500|$|Despite stating he was [...] "100 percent" [...] healthy {{after the}} groin injury {{suffered}} two games prior, it appeared the injury was still lingering; after throwing a pass {{during the third}} quarter, Cutler fell down <b>and</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>his</b> groin, before standing back up. [...] Regarding the injuries, Cutler stated, [...] "It held up OK. It's {{all on the same}} leg so I think that was a problem. But the groin, you take the ankle out of the equation and I would have been fine, I think." [...] Cutler ended the game having completed 21 of 40 passes for 250 yards with a touchdown, interception and a 69.8 passer rating. Despite x-rays on his ankle being negative, Cutler was ruled out of the next week's game against the Baltimore Ravens with a high ankle sprain. During the second quarter, Charles Tillman was also injured, suffering a torn right triceps brachii muscle, and was placed on injured reserve with the designation to return, allowing him to practice after six weeks and play in games two weeks after; as a result, Tillman missed the entire regular season.|$|E

2500|$|The Sixers {{selected}} Charles Barkley in the 1984 NBA draft. When {{he reported}} to training camp at , Malone began to mentor him, encouraging {{him to get}} in better shape. Barkley got down to [...] and made the NBA All-Rookie Team.

Malone scored his 15,000th NBA point on November 28 <b>and</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>his</b> 10,000th NBA rebound on March 29. He scored 51 points against the Detroit Pistons on November 14.

2500|$|In {{a drunken}} revelry, some of Curly Bill's friends were firing pistols {{into the air}} on October 27, 1880, [...] in a dark vacant lot between Toughnut and Allen Streets, near where the Birdcage Theater now stands.

Wyatt Earp had borrowed Fred Dodge's pistol and he pistol-whipped Brocius.

He said he put his arms around Brocius from behind to see if he had any other weapons, and White [...] "gave a quick jerk and the pistol went off." [...] White fell to the ground, wounded. When the pistol discharged, Wyatt buffaloed Brocius and arrested him. Brocius complained, [...] "What have I done? I have not done anything to be arrested for.” ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{lecture at}} the Zoological Institute of the University of Zurich also was {{interrupted}} by two groups of protesters. The first group {{was a group of}} disabled people who staged a brief protest {{at the beginning of the}} lecture. They objected to inviting an advocate of euthanasia to speak. At the end of this protest, when Singer tried to address their concerns, a second group of protesters rose and began chanting [...] "Singer raus! Singer raus!" [...] ("Singer out!") When Singer attempted to respond, a protester jumped on stage <b>and</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>his</b> glasses, and the host ended the lecture. The first group of protesters was distressed by this second, more aggressive group. It had not intended to halt the lecture and even had questions to ask Singer. Singer explains [...] "my views are not threatening to anyone, even minimally" [...] and says that some groups play on the anxieties of those who hear only keywords that are understandably worrying (given the constant fears of ever repeating the Holocaust) if taken with any less than the full context of his belief system.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately after Chávez {{finished}} his broadcast at 5:25pm he changed into his military fatigues <b>and</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>his</b> rifle and pistol worrying about rebels entering the palace. Chávez {{believed that the}} best way to stay in power was to implement Plan Ávila, a constituaionally banned military contingency plan that was created to maintain public order in Caracas that left hundreds to thousands of Venezuelans dead during the Caracazo. Since General Rosendo would not comply earlier in the day with Chávez's order to implement Plan Ávila, Chávez went directly to General Jorge García Carneiro, one of his most trusted generals and ordered him to go through with it. [...] "The killings at the anti-Chávez demonstration rocked the country," [...] The New York Times reported on April 20, [...] "reviving memories of the violent events in 1989, known as the Caracazo, in which hundreds were killed by government forces. Venezuelans across the political spectrum swore that such violence would never take place again." [...] Five minutes after Chávez's broadcast finished, Lameda and Molina Tamayo went on the air at Venevisión, where many opposition leaders had gathered, and, blaming Chávez for the violence, urged the armed forces to intervene.|$|E
2500|$|Together {{with his}} brother Grigory, Alexei Orlov became {{involved}} in the palace coup to overthrow Tsar Peter III and place his wife, Catherine, on the Russian throne. In the coup, carried out in July 1762, Alexei went to meet Catherine at the Peterhof Palace, and finding her in bed, announced 'the time has come for you to reign, madame.' He then drove her to St Petersburg, where the guards regiments there proclaimed their loyalty to her. The Tsar was arrested and imprisoned at Ropsha, under the guard of Alexei Orlov. There Peter died in mysterious circumstances on [...] Orlov is popularly supposed to have murdered him, either on his own initiative or on Catherine's orders. One account has Orlov giving him poisoned wine to drink which caused ... flames [...] through his veins. This aroused suspicion in the overthrown emperor and he refused the next glass. But they used force, and he defended himself. In that horrible struggle, in order to stifle his cries, they threw him on the ground <b>and</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>his</b> throat. But he defended himself with the strength that comes from final desperation, and they tried to avoid wounding him. They placed a rifle strap on the emperor's neck. Alexei Orlov kneeled with both legs on his chest and blocked his breathing. He passed away in their hands. [...] Orlov apparently wrote a letter to Catherine after Peter's death, confessing that Peter had been killed in a drunken brawl with one of his jailers, Feodor Bariatynsky, and taking the blame. The authenticity of this letter has been questioned. It was announced that the Tsar had died from an attack of haemorrhoidal colic.|$|E

It also drew a little nearer {{to the middle of the}} pool, where there was a curious bevelled hollow, round which the white foam spun. It seemed to Nasmyth that the stream went bodily down.|$|E
