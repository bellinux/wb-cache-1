40|$|Little {{is known}} about how a child’s {{experience}} of pain affects his or her parents. Using a vignette methodology, this study investigated the emotional responses of parents who were asked to imagine different painful situations that <b>their</b> <b>child</b> might experience. A sample of 650 parents of school children (325 mothers; 325 fathers) read 8 short stories/vignettes <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>child,</b> which varied in terms of type of situation (pain vs other stressful situation), intensity (high vs low), and frequency of occurrence (high vs low). The role of individual differences in parental catastrophizing <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> pain, catastrophizing <b>about</b> <b>their</b> own pain, dispositional empathy, and gender was also investigated. Parents’ dispositional empathy {{was found to have}} an impact on parental distress and concern for <b>their</b> <b>child.</b> Catastrophizing <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> pain had a unique contribution to parents’ emotional responses to the vignettes describing <b>their</b> <b>child</b> in pain, beyond the influence of other variables. The impact of parental catastrophizing <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> pain was most pronounced for parental distress, probably reflecting the high threat value that they attribute to <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> pain.

500|$|In {{her book}} Free to a Good Home, author Catherine Deveny criticised the {{reaction}} to Charlie and Joey's same sex relationship. She called the first kiss between the couple the [...] "TV disappointment of the year" [...] and she nicknamed the soap Homo Go Away because the scene in which the kiss featured were diluted to suit certain viewers. Of the decline in ratings during the storyline, Deveny said [...] "Since the lesbian plotline began two weeks ago, 100,000 people have turned off. Wow! Turned off. That must {{be the first time}} the words 'lesbian' and 'turn off' have occurred in the same sentence. And all we'd seen until Tuesday was lingering touches and intense stares." [...] Deveny then explained that she would rather let her children watch lesbians on television than Christians.

500|$|When parents {{divorce and}} the {{children}} are in the picture, many problems will arise during the difficult process of determining custody. [...] For instance, {{if there is an}} argument regarding joint legal custody, the process to earn legal custody will take longer than anticipated and will ultimately impact the relationship of the parents {{and the children}}. [...] It may also encourage poor decisions and will damage bonds, which, in turn frequently escalates into a conflict over sole legal custody. [...] Another criticism of having a joint legal custody arrangement {{is that it is a}} frequent occurrence for one parent to attempt to control the majority of decisions in the child's life (regardless of what the decree of joint legal custody states), which generally leads to conflict. Additionally, in a joint legal custody arrangement, if the parents of the children do not get along, this situation has the potential to cause parents to become combative and argue on every decision that needs to be made <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> which can be extremely stressful for not only the children involved, but also for the parents.|$|E

2500|$|The word '' means 'substitute'. It is coded in the DSM-IV under Factitious Disorder NOS (not {{otherwise}} specified). Münchausen {{by proxy}} is the involuntary use of another individual {{to play the}} patient role. For example, false symptoms are produced [...] in children by the caregivers or parents, to produce the appearance of [...] illness, or they may give misleading medical histories <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> The parent may falsify the child's medical history or tamper with laboratory tests to make the child appear sick. Occasionally, in Münchausen by proxy, the caregiver actually injures the child or makes it sick {{to ensure that the}} child is treated.

Abel arrives and joins Adam in a prayer hoping that Cain will soon change his mind (Duet: [...] "Unissons-nous pour le rendre sensible").

Cain's wife Méala is concerned <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> (Aria: [...] "J'attendais que l'aurore en ramenant le jour"). Cain enters and accuses Adam of favouring his brother (Aria: [...] "Quoi! toujours ton image est offerte à mes yeux"). But the united pleas of his family finally persuade him to accept reconciliation with his brother (Sextet with chorus: [...] "Ô moment plein de charmes"). However, even as the two brothers swear friendship, a voice is heard crying [...] "Never!" [...] It is the demon Anamalech, jealous of the happiness of the humans. To avert the curse, the brothers decide to sacrifice to God on their altars. Abel's sacrifice receives a favourable omen, but Anamalech overthrows Cain's altar.

40|$|Background: For {{parents to}} address {{overweight}} or obesity in <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> they first need to perceive <b>their</b> <b>child</b> to be overweight {{and to show}} some level of concern. We aimed to: (1) measure the level of misclassification between children’s actual and parent-perceived weight status, and (2) determine the level of parent concern <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> (actual) weight and whether concern varied according {{to the accuracy of}} parents’ perceptions. Methods: Participants were 1711 primary school children aged 5 – 12 years from the Barwon-South West region of Victoria, Australia. Height and weight were measured and weight status determined using international standards. Parents completed a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) that included questions relating to <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> weight. Results: 448 children (26. 2 % of sample) were overweight or obese. Of these, weight status for almost half (48 %) was underestimated by parents. This ‘bias’ did not vary according to the child’s gender, parent’s education, or household socio-economic status but did for child’s age and parent-respondent gender. More than half (57 %) of the parents of overweight-obese children expressed no concern <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> weight. Parents who underestimated the weight status of <b>their</b> overweight <b>child</b> were significantly less concerned (P < 0. 001) <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> weight than those who correctly perceived <b>their</b> <b>child</b> as overweight. Conclusions: Parents were relatively poor judges of overweight or obesity in <b>their</b> own <b>child</b> and consequently {{there was a lack of}} appropriately directed concern. Education to help parents correctly classify <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> weight status should be part of efforts to prevent unhealthy weight gain. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} parental concerns <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> weight, {{to determine}} the proportion of parents taking preventive action to avoid obesity in <b>their</b> <b>children</b> and the predictors of taking preventive action, and to describe the strategies adopted by parents. Design: A cross-sectional survey was conducted. Children’s heights and weights were measured, and parents completed a questionnaire that included measures of their own weight status, perceptions of <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> weight, concerns <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> current weight and future weight as an adolescent and adult, and the strategies used to prevent obesity. Setting: The {{study was conducted in}} Melbourne, Australia. Subjects: A total of 291 families of children aged 5 – 6 years and 919 families of children aged 10 – 12 years participated. Results: Eighty-nine per cent of parents of overweight 5 – 6 -year-olds and 63 % of parents of overweight 10 – 12 -year-olds were unaware <b>their</b> <b>child</b> was overweight. Seventy-one per cent of parents of overweight 5 – 6 -year-olds and 43 % of parents of overweight 10 – 12 -year-olds were not concerned <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> current weight. Although 31 % of parents of 5 – 6 -year-olds and 43 % of parents of 10 – 12 -year-olds were taking action to prevent unhealthy weight gain in <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> less-educated parents were less likely to do so.
