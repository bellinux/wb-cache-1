5|$|Bats seem to {{make use}} of {{particularly}} strong venomotion, a rhythmic contraction of venous wall muscles. In most mammals, the walls of the veins provide mainly passive resistance, maintaining their shape as deoxygenated blood flows through them, but in bats they appear to actively support blood flow back to the heart with this pumping action. Due to their relatively small and lightweight bodies, bats <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> risk of blood flow rushing to their heads when roosting.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, and Kawasaki disease. Lower doses of aspirin have also been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} death from a heart attack, or the risk of stroke in some circumstances. There is some evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. In the United States low dose aspirin is deemed reasonable in those between 50 and 70 years old who have a more than 10% risk of cardiovascular disease and <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> an increased risk of bleeding who are otherwise healthy.|$|E
5|$|Human {{language}} is also unique {{in being able}} to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events {{that took place in the}} past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> the same time or place as the speech event is called displacement, and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of bees that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human {{language is}} also considered unique.|$|E

5|$|Many {{of these}} species have adaptations to help in under-water locomotion. Water beetles and water bugs have legs adapted into paddle-like structures. Dragonfly naiads use jet propulsion, {{forcibly}} expelling water out of their rectal chamber. Some species like the water striders are capable of walking {{on the surface of}} water. They can do this because their claws <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> the tips of the legs as in most insects, but recessed in a special groove further up the leg; this prevents the claws from piercing the water's surface film. Other insects such as the Rove beetle Stenus are known to emit pygidial gland secretions that reduce surface tension making it possible for them to move on the surface of water by Marangoni propulsion (also known by the German term Entspannungsschwimmen).|$|E
5|$|Near Benton, Fishing Creek's pH {{ranges from}} around 5.6 to 7.25, while near Bloomsburg, {{a wider range}} has been recorded, from 5.8 to 8.5. Near Camp Lavigne, it ranges from 5.5 to 7.1. East Branch Fishing Creek is the only stream in the {{watershed}} whose pH drops below 5.5; it can fall as low as 4.9. West Creek and Coles Creek are the least acidic streams in the watershed, with pH levels usually above 6.3 and often above 7. Typically, the creek and its tributaries <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> risk of becoming too acidic for the optimal health of fish, but in early spring during snowmelts, the levels approach the limit that brook trout can tolerate. Fishing Creek's waters are acidic because of acid rain.|$|E

While there is little question of the historical significance of that goal, Henderson's NHL statistics <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> a level comparable to those players usually selected for induction. His candidacy led to many debates among hockey fans and columnists.|$|E

5|$|Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) mind flashes back {{to being}} in the attic with his sister Samantha while their parents are arguing downstairs. Back in the present, Mulder awakens {{in a hotel room}} in Providence, Rhode Island, covered in blood. Mulder calls Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who arrives, finding him in shock. Mulder has a {{pounding}} headache and has no memory of what he has done in the past two days. Scully finds that two bullets have been fired from Mulder's gun and that he has keys belonging to a David and Amy Cassandra. Scully wants Mulder to check into a hospital, but he wants to find out if he was involved in a crime before doing so. The agents arrive at the Cassandra's house where the housekeeper tells them they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> home. Mulder recognizes a house in many of Cassandra's paintings: a house that is near his parent's summer home in Rhode Island. When they arrive there, Mulder has striking pains in his head and flashes back again to when he was a child, seeing a younger version of The Smoking Man (Chris Owens) in his home. The agents enter the home, where they find the Cassandras dead from gunshot wounds.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 a {{party of}} French {{academics}} attended a condensed matter conference in Ukraine where physicist Daniel Beysens introduced them {{to the story of}} how ancient Theodosia was supplied with water from dew condensers. They were sufficiently intrigued that in 1993 they went to see for themselves. They concluded that the mounds that Zibold identified as dew condensers were in fact ancient burial mounds (a part of the necropolis of antic Theodosia) and that the pipes were medieval in origin and not associated with the mounds. They found the remains of Zibold's condenser, which they tidied up and examined closely. Zibold's condenser had apparently performed reasonably well, but in fact his exact results <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> all clear, and {{it is possible that the}} collector was intercepting fog, which added significantly to the yield. If Zibold's condenser worked at all, this was probably due to fact that a few stones near the surface of the mound were able to lose heat at night while being thermally isolated from the ground; however, it could never have produced the yield that Zibold envisaged.|$|E

25|$|Wheaton College has {{received}} criticism {{in recent years}} from both conservative and liberal alumni. Wheaton's acceptance of evolutionary biology in the science departments has proved controversial to some.

25|$|Besides {{experimental}} research, {{the comparative}} method {{can also be}} employed to investigate hypotheses such as those given by Curio above. For example, closely related species such as the kittiwake do not show mobbing behavior. The kittiwake's cliff nests are almost completely inaccessible to possible predators due to gusty winds and sheer cliffs, meaning its young <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> risk to predation like the black-headed gull. This {{is an example of}} an evolutionary pattern known as divergent evolution.|$|E
