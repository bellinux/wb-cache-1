5|$|Another {{important}} stylistic {{influence was}} the experimental oeuvre of Kenneth Anger, {{and in particular}} Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome. Noé saw Anger's films in the early 1990s, while promoting the short film Carne, and quickly became a fan. Other influences from experimental cinema included the works of Jordan Belson and Peter Tscherkassky. Noé's favourite film, , was the most prominent influence among mainstream films; Noé {{wanted to become a}} filmmaker after he saw it at the age of seven. Brian De Palma's Snake Eyes and other films which feature hovering overhead shots inspired Noé to make a film largely from such <b>a</b> <b>perspective.</b>|$|E
5|$|Love's Last Shift {{is today}} read mainly to gain <b>a</b> <b>perspective</b> on Vanbrugh's sequel The Relapse, which has by {{contrast}} remained a stage favourite. Modern scholars often endorse {{the criticism that}} was levelled at Love's Last Shift from the first, namely {{that it is a}} blatantly commercial combination of sex scenes and drawn-out sentimental reconciliations. Cibber's follow-up comedy Woman's Wit (1697) was produced under hasty and unpropitious circumstances and had no discernible theme; Cibber, not usually shy about any of his plays, even elided its name in the Apology. It was followed by the equally unsuccessful tragedy Xerxes (1699). Cibber reused parts of Woman's Wit for The School Boy (1702).|$|E
5|$|The MAM is a {{critical}} signaling, metabolic, and trafficking hub in the cell that allows for the integration of ER and mitochondrial physiology. Coupling between these organelles is not simply structural but functional as well and critical for overall cellular physiology and homeostasis. The MAM thus offers <b>a</b> <b>perspective</b> on mitochondria that diverges from the traditional view of this organelle as a static, isolated unit appropriated for its metabolic capacity by the cell. Instead, this mitochondrial-ER interface emphasizes {{the integration of the}} mitochondria, the product of an endosymbiotic event, into diverse cellular processes.|$|E

5|$|Caprica-Six and Boomer {{are next}} shown conversing with Number Three. While the three move up a stairwell, {{explosives}} {{set by the}} resistance led by Samuel T. Anders (Michael Trucco) detonate, trapping Anders, Three, Boomer, and Caprica-Six in a parking garage. While Anders is originally shielded and hidden by the blast, Caprica-Six breaks her leg. Number Three offers to euthanize her, but Caprica-Six refuses as she suspects that Number Three will {{take the opportunity to}} box her. Shortly afterwards, the three find Anders who Number Three intends to kill before being stopped by Boomer and Caprica-Six. As Number Three goads them, Boomer and Caprica-Six understand that their unique view of humanity through their love for Baltar and Galen Tyrol gives them <b>a</b> <b>perspective</b> that makes them a threat to the Cylon status-quo. When Number Three attempts to kill Anders, she is killed by Caprica-Six who, along with Boomer, allow Anders to escape. Recognizing that it will take some time for Number Three to resurrect and report them, Caprica-Six and Boomer form a pact to change the Cylon perspective of humanity together before finally being rescued from the collapsed parking garage by the other Cylons.|$|E

25|$|Physics is {{the general}} {{analysis}} of nature, conducted {{in order to understand}} how the universe behaves. On the other hand, the study of meteorological weather patterns or human behavior is only of interest to humans themselves. The point is that having <b>a</b> <b>perspective</b> on the world is a psychological state. Therefore, the special sciences presuppose the existence of minds which can have these states. If one is to avoid ontological dualism, then the mind that has <b>a</b> <b>perspective</b> must be part of the physical reality to which it applies its perspective. If this is the case, then in order to perceive the physical world as psychological, the mind must have <b>a</b> <b>perspective</b> on the physical. This, in turn, presupposes the existence of mind.|$|E

30|$|Esteves and Pastor (2000) {{propose a}} model {{grouping}} the CSFs according to four perspectives: strategic, tactical, organizational, and technological. The organizational perspective {{is related to}} organizational concerns such as organizational structure, culture, and business processes. The technological perspective focuses on aspects related to the ERP product, considerations, and related technical aspects such as basic hardware and software requirements. The strategic perspective is linked to core competencies fulfilling the organization’s long-term missions and objectives, while the tactical perspective affects short-term activities and objectives. Tactical and strategic perspectives are sub-perspectives of organizational and technological perspectives, and this gives us four perspectives: <b>an</b> organizational–tactical <b>perspective,</b> <b>an</b> organizational–strategic <b>perspective,</b> <b>a</b> technological–tactical <b>perspective,</b> and <b>a</b> strategic–technological <b>perspective.</b>|$|R

40|$|This book {{follows a}} {{successful}} symposium organized in June 2009 at the Human Brain Mapping conference. The topic {{is at the}} crossroads of two domains of increasing importance and appeal in the neuroimaging/neuroscience community: multi-modal integration, and social neuroscience. Most of our social interactions involve combining information from both the face and voice of other persons: speech information, but also crucial nonverbal information on the person's identity and affective state. The cerebral bases of the multimodal integration of speech have been intensively investigated; by contrast only few studies have focused on nonverbal aspects of face-voice integration. This work highlights recent advances in investigations of the behavioral and cerebral bases of face-voice multimodal integration in the context of person perception, focusing on the integration of affective and identity information. Several research domains are brought together. Behavioral and neuroimaging work in normal adult humans included are presented alongside evidence from other domains to provide complementary perspectives: studies in human children for <b>a</b> developmental <b>perspective,</b> studies in non-human primates for <b>an</b> evolutionary <b>perspective,</b> and studies in human clinical populations for <b>a</b> clinical <b>perspective.</b> Several research domains are brought together.
