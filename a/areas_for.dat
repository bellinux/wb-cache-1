40|$|The author {{researched}} the degenerating nerve fibres anatomically {{on the brain}} and the spinal cord of dogs by Marchi's method, after removing the parts of each motor <b>area</b> <b>for</b> fore-limb, bind-limb and the mixed <b>area</b> <b>for</b> both limbs. The results were as follows: 1) The efferent fibres from each part of motor cortex and from the premoter cortex are intricated underneath the cortex. 2) The <b>area</b> <b>for</b> fore-limb contains 17 % of Betz's cells <b>for</b> hind-limb; the <b>area</b> <b>for</b> hind-limb contains 9 % of Betz's cells fore-limb, and the mixed <b>area</b> <b>for</b> bothlimbs contains 44 % of Betz's cells for fore-limb and 56 % of Betz's cells for hind-limb; that is to say, the Betz's cells for hind-limb extended much more into the <b>area</b> <b>for</b> fore-limb than those for fore-limb into the <b>area</b> <b>for</b> hind-limb. 3) One of the Neurons from the area 6 aα of premotor cortex pass through the homolateral Nucleus caudatus terminated into the homolateral Nucleus lentiformis. 4) The motor cortex of dogs contains many extrapyramidal tracts. The <b>area</b> <b>for</b> forelimb contains them {{much more than the}} <b>area</b> <b>for</b> hind-limb, {{and in the midst of}} two areas the mixed <b>area</b> <b>for</b> both limbs is situated...|$|R

It is crucial for most amphibians to maintain a high level of genetic variation through large and more diverse environments.|$|E

The interface between meadow and forest is also favored by many animal species because of the proximity of open <b>areas</b> <b>for</b> foraging and cover for protection. Species that are highly dependent upon meadow habitat include great grey owl, willow flycatcher, Yosemite toad, and mountain beaver.|$|E
