40|$|To {{describe}} the evolution, {{risk factors and}} impact of nonimmune histological injury after pediatric kidney transplantation, we analyzed 245 renal allograft protocol biopsies taken regularly {{from the time of}} transplantation to 2 years thereafter in 81 consecutive rejection-free pediatric recipients of an adult-sized kidney. Isometric tubular vacuolization was present early after transplantation was not progressive, and was associated with higher tacrolimus pre-dose trough levels. Chronic tubulo-interstitial damage and tubular microcalcifications were already noted at 3 months, were progressive and had a greater association with small recipient size, male donor gender, higher donor age and female recipient gender, but not with tacrolimus exposure. Renal function assessment showed that older recipients had a significant increase in <b>absolute</b> glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> with time after transplantation, which differed from small recipients who showed no increase. It is concluded that progressive, functionally relevant, nonimmune injury is detected early after adult-sized kidney transplantation in pediatric recipients. Renal graft ischemia associated with the donor-recipient size discrepancy appears to be a greater risk factor for this chronic histological injury, suggesting that the exploration of additional therapeutic approaches to increase allograft perfusion could further extend the graft survival benefit of adult-sized kidneys transplanted into small children. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This {{experimental}} study aims at analyzing the parameters {{associated with the}} renal function before and after a basketball game, in female players of the elite division of Benin. Methods: Blood and urine samples were drawn from antecubital veinus in 16 players of two teams from Porto-Novo, at rest, at the end, one hour and 24 hours after a basketball game, {{in order to determine}} the <b>absolute</b> glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> (GFR) and that reported to the standard of body surface area (GFRc), the urinary sodium/potassium ratio (Na/K), serum albumin and the haemoglobin concentrations. Results: At rest, all the winners and losers presented abnormal decreased values of GFRc, while 13 of them (81. 25 %) are weakened, with a mean haemoglobin concentration of 10. 57 ± 0. 22 g/ 100 mL. At the end of the game, GFRc decreased significantly in the winners (- 27. 32 %, p = 0. 046) and the losers (- 35. 45 %, p = 0. 020). During the following 24 hours, the GFRc gradually increased in the winners, up to a value that is significantly higher than that of the rest (+ 11. 75 %, p = 0. 02). Only the Na/K ratio registered 24 hours after the game in the winners, is significantly higher (p < 0. 001) than preceding measures. Conclusion: A basketball game, played in the hot and wet environment of Porto-Novo (Benin Republic), induced a decrease of GFRc, suggesting a transitory failure of the renal function in these weakened girls at rest. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the incidence of}} contrast material-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients with an estimated glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> (eGFR) of less than 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2) who received intravenous contrast media and underwent treatment in accordance with current guidelines and to determine risk factors associated with CIN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research ethics committee waived the requirement for informed consent for this prospective cohort study. All nonhospitalized patients with an eGFR of less than 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2) were seen at a special outpatient clinic. Patients were stratified for the risk of CIN. They were classified as having high or low risk for CIN {{on the basis of}} <b>absolute</b> glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula result multiplied by body surface area divided by 1. 73 m(2)) and the presence of risk factors. Patients at high risk were hydrated with 1000 mL of isotonic saline before and after contrast material exposure. Serum creatinine level was measured 3 - 5 days later, and CIN was defined as an increase of 25 % of more from the baseline level. Risk factors were recorded and compared between patients with CIN and those without CIN by using forward stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 944 procedures in 747 patients were evaluated. Mean age was 71. 3 years +/- 10 (standard deviation), and 42. 9 % of patients were female. In 511 procedures (54. 1 %), patients were hydrated. CIN developed after 23 procedures (2. 4 %). No patient needed hemodialysis treatment. Heart failure (odds ratio, 3. 0), body mass index (BMI) (odds ratio, 0. 9), and repeated contrast material administration (odds ratio, 2. 8) were found to be independent predictors of CIN. CONCLUSION: Heart failure, low BMI, and repeated contrast material administration were identified as risk factors for CIN under the current treatment strategy. The low incidence of CIN supports the use of hydration as a preventive measure in patients at high risk for CIN...|$|R

40|$|Background and objectives: The {{level of}} glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> at which {{hemoglobin}} declines in {{chronic kidney disease}} is poorly described in the pediatric population. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: This cross-sectional study of North American children with chronic kidney disease examined the association of glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate,</b> determined by the plasma disappearance of iohexol, and hemoglobin concentration.

Material and Method: Serum cystatin C, creatinine and 99 Tc-diethylenetriamene penta acetate (DTPA) clearance (GFRDTPA) were measured in 100 children (53 girls, 47 boys; mean age 8. 4 ± 5. 1). Glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> was calculated by the Schwartz formula. Patients with DTPA clearance, accepted as the a gold standart, above 80 mL/dk/ 1. 73 m 2 were included in group 1 (n= 64) and below 80 mL/dk/ 1. 73 m 2 in group 2 (n= 36). Receiver-operating characteristics analysis was performed to assess their diagnostic accuracy. Signed informed consents of the parents were obtained in all cases. Results: Serum cystatin C and creatinine were correlated with glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> in group 1 and 2. Diethylen etriamene penta acetate (DTPA) clearance was correlated with glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> in both groups, and with cystatin C in group 2.

40|$|<b>Filtration</b> <b>rates</b> of {{the zebra}} mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) on natural seston from two {{different}} regions in Saginaw Bay were determined {{on a monthly basis}} from April to October in 1992 and 1993. The two regions represent contrasting trophic conditions, with the inner bay more eutrophic than the outer bay. Mean <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> was 16. 2 mL/mg/h (range 4. 0 to 40. 7 mL/mg/h) over the entire 2 -year period. <b>Filtration</b> <b>rates</b> on seston from the inner bay were significantly lower than rates on seston from the outer bay in 1992, but no differences were apparent in 1993. Lower rates were attributed to higher concentrations of seston (chlorophyll, particulate organic carbon, and total suspended solids) found in the inner bay in 1992. In 1992, overall <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> were related to seston concentrations as described by a negative exponential function.

40|$|Downward and upward {{ultrafiltration}} (UF) {{was performed}} using the suspensions of nanosized colloidal silica with different particle diameters and their <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> were compared. In downward UF, the <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> decreases as the particle diameter decreases because the specific filtration {{resistance of the}} filter cake becomes significantly higher. In contrast, the <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> in upward UF increases with the decrease in the particle diameter because the filter cake consisting of small particles is exfoliated much more easily {{under the influence of}} gravity than that of large ones. In order to evaluate the characteristics of the filter cake exfoliation, the steady <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> in the upward mode was measured. The steady <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> has a tendency to decrease with particle concentration as well as mean particle diameter. Therefore, when the small particles are added into a given concentration of large particle suspension, the mean particle diameter decreases and the total particle concentration increases due to the dosage of small particles. This results in a maximum of the steady <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> at a certain dosage of small particles. Moreover, an estimation equation was proposed for predicting the steady <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> in upward UF of colloidal silica suspensions with various mean particle diameters and total particle concentrations...|$|R

The objective was to study the natural history and the predictive value of glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate,</b> albumin excretion rate, blood pressure, and hemoglobin Alc for diabetic nephropathy. A cohort of 75 type- 1 diabetic adolescents with a diabetes duration of 8 years was studied. Thirty-one females, 33 males, mean age 16. 9 ± 0. 3 (SEM) participated in the follow-up study. Glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate,</b> albumin excretion rate, blood pressure, and hemoglobin Alc were measured every second year during 8 years to determine the predictive value of glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> for future nephropathy. Initial differences and patterns of changes in glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate,</b> albumin excretion rate, and hemoglobin Alc were examined in patients who did (group 1) and did not (group 2) develop incipient or overt nephropathy. Five of 64 patients developed overt nephropathy. They had an initial glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> of > 125 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2. Fifteen of 53 initially normoalbuminuric patients developed incipient and three of 53 overt nephropathy. Age, age at onset, diabetes duration, initial albumin excretion rate, initial blood pressure, and hemoglobin Alc were similar in groups 1 and 2. Glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> was initially higher in group 1 than in group 2 (P = 0. 01). The positive predictive value for combined incipient and overt nephropathy of an initial glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> > 125 ml/min was 53 %. The negative predictive value of glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> < 125 ml/min was 95 %. In initially normoalbuminuric patients multiple regression revealed initial glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> as the only significant independent predictor for nephropathy when also corrected for hemoglobin Alc (P = 0. 04). Albumin excretion rate increased after 6 years (mean diabetes duration 18 years) in group 1 as compared to initial levels (P = 0. 004). Only systolic blood pressure tended to increase after 8 years. Until then it was the same in groups 1 and 2 (P = 0. 04). We conclude that increased glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> predicts nephropathy independently of metabolic control also in normoalbuminuric diabetic patients. Increased albumin excretion rate precedes the rise in blood pressure in the development of nephropathy...|$|R

Full text Embargoed until: 2015 - 07 - 31 Aims It has been proposed that the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula estimates glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> more accurately than the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. With the very high incidence of diabetes and end-stage kidney disease in Indigenous Australians, accurate estimation of glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> is vital in early detection of kidney disease. We aimed to assess {{the performance of the}} Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease and Cockcroft-Gault formulas in Indigenous Australians with and without diabetes. Methods Indigenous Australians with (n= 224) or without (n= 340) Type 2 diabetes had a reference glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> measure using plasma disappearance of iohexol (measured glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate)</b> over 4 h. Serum creatinine was measured by an enzymatic method. Performance was assessed by bias (measured glomerular filtration rate-estimated glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate)</b> and accuracy (percentage of estimated glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> within 30 % of measured glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate).</b> Results The median measured glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> (interquartile range) in participants with or without diabetes was 97 (68 - 119) and 108 (90 - 122) mlmin- 11. 73 m- 2, respectively. The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula had smaller bias and greater accuracy than the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease and Cockcroft-Gault formulas overall, for participants both with and without diabetes. However, for estimated glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> > 90 mlmin- 11. 73 m- 2, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula had greater bias in participants with diabetes, underestimating measured glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> by 7. 4 vs. 1. 0 mlmin- 11. 73 m- 2 in those without diabetes. The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula was less accurate across the whole range of estimated glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> in participants with vs. those without diabetes (87. 1 % vs. 93. 3 %). Conclusions The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula outperforms the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease and Cockcroft-Gault formulas overall in Indigenous Australians with and without diabetes. However, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula has greater bias in people with diabetes compared with those without diabetes, especially in those with normal renal function.

40|$|Fifty-six type I {{diabetic}} {{patients with}} microalbuminuria (albumin excretion rate 20 - 200 micrograms/min) were characterized as to sex, age, duration of diabetes, smoking habits, blood pressure, glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate,</b> urinary NC 1 (the carboxy-terminal domain of collagen IV), and Tamm-Horsfall protein excretion rate. Albumin excretion rate {{was considered a}} sign of glomerular damage, NC 1 excretion rate a measure of renal basement membrane turnover, and Tamm-Horsfall protein excretion rate a marker for distal tubular function. There were no differences {{between males and females}} and between smokers and nonsmokers with respect to blood pressure, body-mass index, albumin excretion <b>rate,</b> glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate,</b> excretion rate of NC 1, and Tamm-Horsfall protein. As a group, the patients with microalbuminuria had normal glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate,</b> excretion rate of NC 1, and Tamm-Horsfall protein. The latter was influenced by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) levels, especially so in patients with an albumin excretion rate less than the median value of 53. 0 micrograms/min (r = - 0. 61, p or = 130 mL min- 1 1. 73 m- 2). There was no association between glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> and HbA 1 c levels. As glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> is related to kidney size, these observations suggest that patients with a high glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> have an increased mass and turnover of tubular basement membrane.

40|$|Background Steroid Resistant Nephrotic Syndrome (SRNS) {{is one of}} {{nephrotic}} syndrome classification which {{do not respond to}} therapy with steroid. Children with SRNS have high risk of decline of kidney’s function. Glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> can be used as indicator of kidney’s function. Snakehead fish extract supplementation can increase serum albumin level, therefore is expected to increase glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> indirectly. Aim This study aims to prove the effect of Snakehead fish extract supplementation on glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> in children with SRNS aged 2 - 18 years old. Methods This was a quasi experimental study with pre and post design performed in the pediatric polyclinic of Kariadi General Hospital, Semarang. There were 10 patients which 3 of them drop out in the process. Patients recieved gabus-fish extract suplementation with 2 x 500 mg dose for 21 days. Data was statistically analyzed by paired t-test. Results The initial Glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> mean was 114, 09 ± 41, 60 ml/min/ 1, 73 m 2 decreased to 105, 97 ± 33, 81 ml/menit/ 1, 73 m 2 after the intervention, with differences mean of - 8, 12 ± 39, 23 ml/menit/ 1, 73 m 2. There was no significant difference (p= 0, 604) in glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> before and after intervention. Conclusion Snakehead fish extract capsules supplementation at a dose of 2 x 500 mg for 21 days did not significantly change glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> of children with SRNS.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to describe the influence of water temperature and salinity on <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> of the venus clam, Gomphina veneriformis, a suspension-feeding (filter-feeding) bivalve species. The calms were collected from the eastern coastal area of Sokcho, Gangneung and Jumunjin at Kangwon-do, Korea, during December 2006 and May 2007. Isochrysis galbana (KMCC H- 002) cells as food organisms were indoor-cultured by f/ 2 medium, and were {{used to measure the}} <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> of clam. <b>Filtration</b> <b>rates</b> of clam were measured by indirect method. Cell concentration of food organisms were determined by direct counting cells used the hemacytometer under the light microscope. The <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> of clams by water temperature sharply increased with temperatures up to 15 ℃ as optimum temperature and above this temperature, the <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> decreased exponentially. Venus clams showed very low <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> at low salinity (10 - 15 psu) and maximum values at high salinity (30 - 35 psu). Regardless of water temperature and salt change, 2 -year class clams showed high <b>filtration</b> <b>rates,</b> but low in 4 -year-class. Polynomial regression curves with water temperature were shifted to the left in low temperature region. Thermal coefficient Q 10 values showed much higher values at low temperature range than at high temperature range, too. These results indicate that the venus clam is more sensitive in cold water. Polynomial regression curves with salinity were shifted to the right in high saline region. According to this study, the venu...|$|R

40|$|Background : low glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> is a known poor {{prognostic}} {{factor in}} acute coronary syndrome, particularly when associated with diabetes mellitus. Objective : {{to determine the}} prognostic value of glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> in hospitalized diabetic patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Methods : a case-series {{study was conducted in}} 68 diabetic patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction admitted to the Camilo Cienfuegos Hospital in Sancti Spiritus from January 2012 to December 2013. The glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> on admission was estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation. Cardiovascular risk factors, clinical and laboratory variables, the ejection fraction and hospital mortality were analyzed. Results : low glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> was associated with a left ventricular ejection fraction < 45 % at discharge (p = 0. 0060) and cardiac complications including arrhythmias, atrioventricular conduction disturbances, reinfarction, postinfarction angina and Killip class ≥ III (p = 0. 0000). It was also associated with increased mortality and lower reperfusion rates. Conclusions : estimating the glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> in diabetic patients with acute coronary syndrome at the time of admission provides significant information for prognosis in the acute phase, even in those with normal creatinine values. A glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> less than 53 mL/min increases the risk of suffering an adverse event during hospitalization eight times. </p...|$|R

40|$|Crassostrea virginica, {{the eastern}} oyster, is a filter-feeding, {{particle}} clearing bivalve currently at low numbers in Chesapeake Bay. Accurately describing the <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> of these bivalves {{is essential to}} estuarine management and associated efforts to understand the impact of oyster populations on water quality. Here, the <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> equations for three existing models (Cerco and Noel (2005), Fulford et al. (2007), and Powell et al. (1992)) are assessed. I examine how each of the models define the maximum <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> and explore the various limitation factors that modify these maximum rates via environmental conditions that include salinity, temperature, total suspended solids, and dissolved oxygen.

40|$|It {{has always}} been {{desirable}} for clinicians to ascertain whether glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> has recovered or still depressed at the bedside as increase in serum creatinine often indicates acute kidney injury to a clinician. In recent years, several clinical studies have developed mathematical models to simulate the creatinine response to changes in glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> which includes the estimated glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration, the Chen-kinetic estimated GFR model and the modified Chen-Pianta-Endre-Pickering-Bukley-Pecke kinetic estimated GFR model. Another study also showed that the ratio of creatinine excretion rates to creatinine production rates may predict changes in plasma concentration. The {{aim of this study}} is to allow clinicians to gauge the performance of glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> estimation using the aforementioned equations and models to predict worsening of renal function, indicated by a low kinetic estimated glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> or creatinine production rates less than unity, or recovery of kidney function, indicated by high kinetic estimated glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate.</b> In order to achieve this a mobile software is developed to aid data collection and calculation for the clinical study based on the aforementioned models.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} intrarenal arterial stiffness by Doppler ultrasound {{and examine}} the correlation between renal Doppler indices, glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate,</b> and digital microvascular damage in systemic sclerosis patients. Methods: Thirty systemic sclerosis patients and 30 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Doppler indices of intrarenal arterial stiffness, peak systolic flow velocity, end diastolic flow velocity, resistive index, pulsative index, and systolic/diastolic (S/D) ratio were measured on the interlobar artery of both kidneys. Glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> was measured using Tc- 99 m diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA). Equation 7 from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease was used to estimate glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate.</b> Nailfold videocapillaroscopy findings were classified as early, active, and late patterns. Results: The intrarenal arterial stiffness, evaluated by Doppler indices, was higher in systemic sclerosis patients than healthy controls. In systemic sclerosis patients pulsative index (r = - 0. 69), resistive index (r = - 0. 75), and S/D ratio (r = - 0. 74) showed a negative correlation with measured glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> (P < 0001). High correlation (P = 0008) was observed between measured and estimated glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> (r = 0. 55). Pulsative index, resistive index, and S/D ratio significantly increased with progression of capillaroscopic damage. Conversely, measured glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> significantly decreased with capillaroscopic damage progression. Conclusions: Doppler indices of intrarenal arterial stiffness are noninvasive diagnostic tests to evaluate renal damage in SSc patients. Intrarenal arterial stiffness and glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> correlate with capillaroscopic microvascular damage. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
