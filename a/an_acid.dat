5|$|<b>An</b> <b>acid</b> {{dissociation}} constant, Ka, (also {{known as}} acidity constant, or acid-ionization constant) is a quantitative {{measure of the}} strength of <b>an</b> <b>acid</b> in solution. It is the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction known as dissociation in the context of acid–base reactions. and the constants for dissociation of successive protons as Ka2, etc. Phosphoric acid, H3PO4, {{is an example of a}} polyprotic acid as it can lose three protons.|$|E
5|$|Stability {{constants}} of complexes: {{formation of}} a complex can often {{be seen as a}} competition between proton and metal ion for a ligand, which is the product of dissociation of <b>an</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
5|$|The acidic triad member forms a {{hydrogen}} {{bond with the}} basic residue. This aligns the basic residue by restricting its side-chain rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge. Two amino acids have acidic side chains at physiological pH (aspartate or glutamate) {{and so are the}} most commonly used for this triad member. Cytomegalovirus protease uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid. The second histidine is not as effective <b>an</b> <b>acid</b> as the more common aspartate or glutamate, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In some enzymes, the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad. For example, papain uses asparagine as its third triad member which orients the histidine base but does not act as <b>an</b> <b>acid.</b> Similarly, hepatitis A virus protease contains an ordered water in the position where <b>an</b> <b>acid</b> residue should be.|$|E

5000|$|Only two {{fatty acids}} {{are known to}} be {{essential}} for humans: alpha-linolenic <b>acid</b> (<b>an</b> omega-3 fatty <b>acid)</b> and linoleic <b>acid</b> (<b>an</b> omega-6 fatty <b>acid).</b> Some other fatty acids are sometimes classified as [...] "conditionally essential," [...] meaning that they can become essential under some developmental or disease conditions; examples include docosahexaenoic <b>acid</b> (<b>an</b> omega-3 fatty <b>acid)</b> and gamma-linolenic <b>acid</b> (<b>an</b> omega-6 fatty <b>acid).</b>|$|R
5|$|Common {{chemical}} theory {{at that time}} held that <b>an</b> <b>acid</b> {{is a compound that}} contains oxygen (remnants of this survive in the German and Dutch names of oxygen: sauerstoff or zuurstof, both translating into English as acid substance), so a number of chemists, including Claude Berthollet, suggested that Scheele's dephlogisticated muriatic acid air must be a combination of oxygen and the yet undiscovered element, muriaticum.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{began to}} develop severe stomach pains, but refused to see a doctor. He distrusted them because his {{brother-in-law}} had died after having a pacemaker installed.

5|$|Sodium {{chromate}} {{is produced}} industrially by the oxidative roasting of chromite ore with calcium or sodium carbonate. The dominant species is therefore, {{by the law}} of mass action, determined by the pH of the solution. The change in equilibrium is visible by a change from yellow (chromate) to orange (dichromate), such as when <b>an</b> <b>acid</b> is added to a neutral solution of potassium chromate. At yet lower pH values, further condensation to more complex oxyanions of chromium is possible.|$|E
40|$|Previous studied {{have shown}} that vitamin <b>A</b> <b>acid</b> topically applied to the dry keratotic keratoacanthoma products, in vivo, a metaplasia. Further studies {{have shown that}} {{radioactive}} vitamin <b>A</b> <b>acid</b> is taken up by normal rabbit hair follicle epithelium as well as the keratoacanthoma. Most of the grains are localized over the euchromatin after 48 hrs, 72 hrs and even after 96 hrs. In the present study, the effect of actinomycin D on the uptake of labeled vitamin <b>A</b> <b>acid</b> in normal epidermal cells and in the keratoacanthoma was studied by electron microscope radioautography. When actinomycin D is applied either in 1 or 2 doses prior to labeled vitamin <b>A</b> <b>acid,</b> very few grains are observed over the nuclei of the keratinocytes. Most of the grains are localized over the tonofibrils or the cytoplasmic ground substance. When labeled vitamin <b>A</b> <b>acid</b> is applied prior to actinomycin D, grains still predominate over the cytoplasm or its organelles when biopsies are taken 24 hrs after the last application of the antibiotic. However, biopsies taken 48 hrs after actinomycin D was last applied depicts most of the grains over the loose chromatin of the nuclei of the keratinocytes in the stratum spinosum. These results simulate very closely what one observes if only labeled vitamin <b>A</b> <b>acid</b> is applied and biopsies examined 48 hrs later. This experiment suggests that vitamin <b>A</b> <b>acid</b> or its metabolite is incorporated into the nucleus and establishes a new direction of protein synthesis (glycoprotein formation) which actinomycin D cannot influence unless the antibiotic precedes the vitamin <b>A</b> <b>acid</b> applications...|$|R

5|$|The {{synthesis}} of aspirin {{is classified as}} an esterification reaction. Salicylic acid is treated with acetic anhydride, <b>an</b> <b>acid</b> derivative, causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acid's hydroxyl group into an ester group (R-OH → R-OCOCH3). This process yields aspirin and acetic acid, which is considered a byproduct of this reaction. Small amounts of sulfuric acid (and occasionally phosphoric acid) are almost always used as a catalyst. This method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs.|$|E
5|$|In 1781, Carl Wilhelm Scheele {{discovered}} that a new acid, tungstic acid, could be made from scheelite (at the time named tungsten). Scheele and Torbern Bergman suggested {{that it might be}} possible to obtain a new metal by reducing this acid. In 1783, José and Fausto Elhuyar found <b>an</b> <b>acid</b> made from wolframite that was identical to tungstic acid. Later that year, at the Royal Basque Society in the town of Bergara, Spain, the brothers succeeded in isolating tungsten by reduction of this acid with charcoal, and they are credited with the discovery of the element.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Mya Breitbart, Forest Rohwer, {{and colleagues}} used {{environmental}} shotgun sequencing (see below) {{to show that}} 200 liters of seawater contains over 5000 different viruses. Subsequent studies showed {{that there are more}} than a thousand viral species in human stool and possibly a million different viruses per kilogram of marine sediment, including many bacteriophages. Essentially all of the viruses in these studies were new species. In 2004, Gene Tyson, Jill Banfield, and colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley and the Joint Genome Institute sequenced DNA extracted from <b>an</b> <b>acid</b> mine drainage system. This effort resulted in the complete, or nearly complete, genomes for a handful of bacteria and archaea that had previously resisted attempts to culture them.|$|E

5|$|In aprotic solvents, oligomers, {{such as the}} {{well-known}} acetic acid dimer, may be formed by hydrogen bonding. <b>An</b> <b>acid</b> may also form hydrogen bonds to its conjugate base. This process, known as homoconjugation, {{has the effect of}} enhancing the acidity of acids, lowering their effective pKa values, by stabilizing the conjugate base. Homoconjugation enhances the proton-donating power of toluenesulfonic acid in acetonitrile solution by a factor of nearly 800. In aqueous solutions, homoconjugation does not occur, because water forms stronger hydrogen bonds to the conjugate base than does the acid.|$|E

5|$|Uranium ore is mined {{in several}} ways: by open pit, underground, in-situ leaching, and {{borehole}} mining (see uranium mining). Low-grade uranium ore mined typically contains 0.01 to 0.25% uranium oxides. Extensive measures must {{be employed to}} extract the metal from its ore. High-grade ores found in Athabasca Basin deposits in Saskatchewan, Canada can contain up to 23% uranium oxides on average. Uranium ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either <b>an</b> <b>acid</b> or alkali. The leachate is subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation, solvent extraction, and ion exchange. The resulting mixture, called yellowcake, contains at least 75% uranium oxides U3O8. Yellowcake is then calcined to remove impurities from the milling process before refining and conversion.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{restoration}} {{is a type}} {{of chemical}} milling. Typically, chemical milling is used to slowly remove material to create a desired shape. In serial number restoration, small amounts of metal are removed until the serial number is brought back to the surface. This can be performed due to the depth that serial numbers are engraved into the weapon. However, chemical restoration is limited by that depth and is only successful when the obliteration of the serial number is superficial. Examiners performing a restoration first sand the area where the serial number used to be. This removes any debris from the area left when the serial number was obliterated. The examiner then chooses a chemical, usually <b>an</b> <b>acid,</b> that will be used to slowly bring the number back to the surface. The type of chemical that is used depends on the material the weapon is made of. These acids can range from Fry's Reagent for a magnetic metal, which is a mixture of hydrochloric acid, cupric chloride, and distilled water, to an acidic ferric chloride solution for a non-magnetic, non-aluminum material.|$|E
5|$|Just {{two years}} after opening, a flood in March 1904 did serious damage to the structure. However, the owners hired the Horseheads Bridge Company, run by the Perkins brothers. They charged $7,000 (1904 USD) to {{complete}} repairs of the bridge. With the reopening of the bridge, and along with the newly constructed Erie Railroad station, a new revitalization came to Skinners Falls and Milanville, including <b>an</b> <b>acid</b> company, creamery, and a dairy company, which helped raise income for the bridge using the $0.22 toll. One company that could not make it is the Skinners' timber rafting, which had been in business for over 140 years. In 1914, J. Skinner was the new owner, but the company was devastated when one of their timber rafts collided with a Myers family-owned ferryboat, killing four. The blame {{was placed on the}} ferry operator. However, along with the tragedy, the lack of riverside forests made it hard for timber rafting to prosper and in 1914, they closed their doors.|$|E
