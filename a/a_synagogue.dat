5|$|Those who {{organized}} the congregation in 1885 {{were part of a}} substantial wave of Romanian-Jewish immigrants, most of whom settled in the Lower East Side. The Rivington Street building, built around 1860, had previously been a church, then <b>a</b> <b>synagogue,</b> then a church again, and had been extensively remodeled in 1889. It was transformed into <b>a</b> <b>synagogue</b> for a second time when the First Roumanian-American congregation purchased it in 1902 and again remodeled it.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007, the {{university}} was given planning permission to build the Surrey Multifaith Centre. This {{will be the first}} building in Britain to have <b>a</b> <b>Synagogue,</b> Muslim Prayer Hall, Gurdwara and Chapel built separately under one roof.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{residents were}} a mixed group of both religiously observant and non-observant Jews. They later split up into two groups, and the non-observant members established a new settlement, Vered Yericho, {{located in the}} Jordan Valley below Mitzpe Yeriho and closer to Jericho. Still, Mitzpe Yeriho is a community of various traditions and observance levels. While the main synagogue follows Ashkenazi traditions, there are also two Sephardi <b>synagogues,</b> <b>a</b> Chabad <b>synagogue,</b> <b>a</b> Yemenite <b>synagogue,</b> <b>a</b> Carlebach minyan and several other small functioning minyanim.|$|R
5|$|There was <b>a</b> <b>Synagogue</b> at 49 North Street for the Lurgan Hebrew Congregation, founded {{prior to}} 1906 by Joseph Herbert (originally Herzberg) from Tukums in Latvia, but this {{closed in the}} 1920s {{around the time of}} the founder's death.|$|E
5|$|Because of its Ottoman past, Skopje {{has more}} mosques than churches. Religious {{communities}} often {{complain about the}} lack of infrastructure and new places of worship are often built. Skopje is the seat of many Macedonian religious organisations, such as the Macedonian Orthodox Church and the Islamic Religious Union of Macedonia. It has an Orthodox cathedral and seminary, several madrasahs, a Roman Catholic cathedral and <b>a</b> <b>synagogue.</b>|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by the 1782 Edict of Tolerance of Emperor Joseph II, Jews first {{permanently}} {{settled in}} Zagreb {{in the late}} eighteenth century, and founded the Jewish community in 1806. In 1809 the Jewish community had a rabbi, and by 1811 it had its own cemetery. As early as 1833, the community was permitted to buy land for construction of <b>a</b> <b>synagogue,</b> but did not have sufficient money to finance one at the time.|$|E

5|$|In February 2015, in {{the wake}} of the Charlie Hebdo shootings in Paris, a gunman opened fire on attendants and police {{officers}} at a meeting discussing freedom of speech with the Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks among the panelists, and later attacked <b>a</b> <b>synagogue</b> killing two people in Copenhagen in the 2015 Copenhagen shootings.|$|E
5|$|Judaism {{is a minor}} {{religion}} in Mauritius. The first Jews arrived from Haifa, British Palestine (now Israel), in the 1940s because they were denied entry to Palestine by the British Government. There currently are about 150 Jews in total in Mauritius. There is <b>a</b> <b>synagogue</b> in Curepipe, and a Jewish cemetery in Bambous.|$|E
5|$|Shooting {{began in}} March 1940 and, with the {{exception}} of some scenes which were shot on location in Prague, most of the filming took place at the UFA studios in Berlin Babelsberg. The scenes showing the entry of the Jews into Württemberg and worshipping in <b>a</b> <b>synagogue</b> were filmed in Prague where Jewish extras were coerced into performing.|$|E
50|$|The {{congregation}} became {{affiliated with}} United Synagogue in 1946, becoming <b>a</b> district <b>synagogue</b> in 1952 and subsequently <b>a</b> constituent (member) <b>synagogue.</b>|$|R
50|$|Beth Sholom Congregation, <b>an</b> unaffiliated <b>synagogue,</b> {{has been}} in Frederick since 1917. Congregation Kol Ami, <b>a</b> Reform <b>synagogue,</b> was founded in 2003. Chabad Lubavitch of Fredrick, a Chabad, was founded in 2009.|$|R

5|$|That {{year the}} {{congregation}} raised $14,000 (today $) and hired the architectural firm Lescher, Kibbey and Mahoney {{to design and}} construct <b>a</b> <b>synagogue</b> building near Central Avenue and Culver Street, in Downtown Phoenix. The building, a simple, stuccoed, gable-end-to-the-street Mission Revival Style structure, was constructed in 1921–1922, and an annex added in 1930.|$|E
5|$|After 1986, the Jewish Community of Zagreb {{began to}} {{consider}} a Jewish cultural center and a memorial synagogue. Two architects, Branko Silađin and Boris Morsan, both of whom participated in the failed 1977 department store competition, came forward on their own accord and contributed their ideas for a new Jewish center in Praška Street. Silađin's vision was ultimately not accepted by the Jewish community; instead, plans were being made {{for the construction of}} the cultural center and <b>a</b> <b>synagogue,</b> following an international architecture competition. However, despite support for the project both within Yugoslavia and abroad, the issuance of necessary permits was either stalled or denied by the municipal government. The project was not developed.|$|E
5|$|Born in Cologne, {{the son of}} <b>a</b> <b>synagogue</b> cantor, Offenbach showed early musical talent. At the age of 14, he was {{accepted}} {{as a student at}} the Paris Conservatoire but found academic study unfulfilling and left after a year. From 1835 to 1855 he earned his living as a cellist, achieving international fame, and as a conductor. His ambition, however, was to compose comic pieces for the musical theatre. Finding the management of Paris' Opéra-Comique company uninterested in staging his works, in 1855 he leased a small theatre in the Champs-Élysées. There he presented a series of his own small-scale pieces, many of which became popular.|$|E
5000|$|Both of Mr. Nelson’s {{parents are}} Jewish, {{and his family}} {{attended}} temple at <b>a</b> black <b>synagogue</b> in Brooklyn, then switched to Sharey Tefilo-Israel, in South Orange, New Jersey, <b>a</b> reform <b>synagogue</b> with <b>a</b> liberal reputation.|$|R

50|$|Elstree {{was home}} to Ohr Yisrael <b>Synagogue,</b> <b>an</b> {{friendly}} Orthodox <b>synagogue</b> with affiliation to the Federation of Synagogues. However, the synagogue's present location is just within Borehamwood. The village currently sports two synagogues; The Shtiebel, <b>an</b> ultra-orthodox <b>synagogue,</b> and The Liberal Synagogue Elstree, just south of St. Nicholas' Church.|$|R
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, {{there were three}} mosques, two schools, two takyas and a hammam on the citadel. The citadel also housed <b>a</b> <b>synagogue</b> until 1957. The only {{religious}} structure that currently survives is the Mulla Afandi Mosque, which was rebuilt on the location of an earlier 19th-century mosque. The hammam was built in 1775 by Qassim Agha Abdullah. It went out of service during the 1970s and was renovated in 1979, although many original architectural details were lost.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1875 as the First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland, Temple Sinai is {{the oldest}} synagogue in the East Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area. It grew out of Oakland's Hebrew Benevolent Society, which had been {{organized}} in 1862 by eighteen merchants and shopkeepers from several foreign countries—predominantly Polish Jews from Posen. Although Hebrew Benevolent Societies typically ceased operations upon the founding of <b>a</b> <b>synagogue,</b> Oakland's was unusual in continuing to function independently {{for a number of}} years (the two groups did not merge until 1881).|$|E
5|$|However, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) {{criticized the}} design of Grandpa Boris and charged it with being anti-Semitic. The {{controversy}} erupted when a 1998 Rugrats comic strip was published, featuring Boris in <b>a</b> <b>synagogue</b> reciting the Mourner's Kaddish. The ADL {{issued a statement saying}} that the design resembled Nazi-era depictions of Jews, {{and the fact that the}} character was reciting the sacred prayer perverted its solemnity. The Washington Post, the newspaper who published the strip, issued a similar statement in their Editor's Note section, criticizing Nickelodeon for not showing better judgment in editing the strip.|$|E

5|$|Many {{contemporary}} Orthodox scholars {{rule that}} the area {{in front of the}} Wall has the status of <b>a</b> <b>synagogue</b> and must be treated with due respect. This is the view upheld by the authority in charge of the wall. As such, men and married women are expected to cover their heads upon approaching the Wall, and to dress appropriately. When departing, the custom is to walk backwards away from the Wall. On Saturdays, it is forbidden to enter the area with electronic devices, including cameras, which infringe on the sanctity of the Sabbath.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{contention}} arose {{over what}} kind of institution the Hurva would be. Secularist and nationalist-religious activists opposed the notion of another synagogue in the Old City and wanted the site to become a museum presenting the historical saga of the Jewish Quarter and displaying archaeological finds unearthed there. They viewed the appointment of Kook as the rabbi while the structure was still a shell as a move aimed at preventing a Modern Orthodox rabbi, {{who would have been}} more amenable to a broader utilisation of the site, from getting the position. Rabbi of the Jewish Quarter, Avigdor Nebenzahl, has been clear that he wants the building to serve as <b>a</b> <b>synagogue</b> and a house of study.|$|E
5|$|Tememe Derech built <b>a</b> <b>synagogue</b> in the 500 {{block of}} Carondelet Street in the Central City section of New Orleans in 1867. It {{was the sole}} Orthodox {{congregation}} to construct its own building; {{only a minority of}} New Orleans' Jews were Orthodox, and other congregations rented space or met in members' homes. Tememe Derech's membership, however, never exceeded 50, and in 1903 or 1904 the synagogue disbanded, and merged with a number of other small Orthodox congregations and a burial society to form Beth Israel. Services were initially held in rented quarters in the same 500 block of Carondelet Street.|$|E
