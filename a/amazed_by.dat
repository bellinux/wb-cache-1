5|$|Authorities were <b>amazed</b> <b>by</b> the {{similarities}} between Cox's actual crimes and his unpublished manuscript, The Associates, which they found several years before Cox was arrested. The novel's protagonist is 5ft 7in (170cm), has brown hair and blue eyes. Cox is 5ft 6in (168cm), has brown hair and green eyes.

5|$|Questions {{were asked}} in the House of Commons {{about the cost of}} {{policing}} the statue, which required six constables a day at a cost of £700 a year. London's police commissioner wrote to Battersea Council to ask that they contribute to it. Councillor John Archer, later Mayor of Battersea and the first black mayor in London, told the Daily Mail that he was <b>amazed</b> <b>by</b> the request, considering Battersea was already paying £22,000 a year in police rates. The Canine Defence League wondered whether, if Battersea were to organize raids on laboratories, the laboratories would be asked to pay the policing costs themselves.|$|E
5|$|The film is {{considered}} to be a breakthrough film for both Rama Rao and Ranga Rao. Rama Rao later starred in other folklore films like Chandirani (1953), Rechukka (1954) and Jayasimha (1955); all of which were commercially successful. When the film's unit was travelling by train to attend the 100thday celebrations of Pathala Bhairavi at Bellary, the then Union Home Minister C. Rajagopalachari was travelling in Madras Mail. When both the trains happened to halt at Guntakal, people who had come to greet Rajagopalachari rushed to the other platform to have a glimpse of the film's unit, which left Rajagopalachari <b>amazed</b> <b>by</b> the popularity that the film had attained.|$|E

5|$|Reception {{towards the}} {{introduction}} of Takedowns was highly positive. Reviewers admired the impact that Takedowns had in transforming the boost mechanic and shifting the game's focus to a more aggressive style of driving. GamesTM {{pointed out that the}} hostile behaviour of AI rivals supplemented the system by presenting more opportunities to perform Takedowns, culminating in an intense and dramatic racing experience. Lopez explained that Burnout 3 had intelligently integrated elements of vehicular combat games by introducing Takedowns. Gerstmann commended the game's use of Impact Time and Aftertouch mechanics, which he believed made crashing an entertaining aspect of the game unlike other racers. IGN's Fran Mirabella III was <b>amazed</b> <b>by</b> the crash system; he considered it to be far ahead of anything that had been done before.|$|E
5|$|Sahil and Jai {{drive to}} Mahabaleshwar overnight, and upon arrival decide {{to visit the}} local market. Jai is <b>amazed</b> <b>by</b> Sahil's skill as a guitarist and {{suggests}} that he pursue {{a career as a}} fulltime musician. Later, he gifts him a guitar during lunch. The two engage in several arguments and bicker about their plans throughout the trip, while enjoying each other's company nonetheless. Sahil is irked by Jai's indifferent behaviour and finds it annoying that he works even during the trip. Jai too is not pleased with Sahil's continuous badgering. One night, the two get into a heated argument over their differences. Later, Jai embraces Sahil in his bed and tries to kiss him. The latter resists, and asks Jai to go to sleep as they have to get up early the next morning.|$|E
5|$|The Federation {{starship}} Enterprise {{arrives at}} Starbase74 for a routine maintenance check. Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) greet Starbase Commander Quinteros (Gene Dynarski) and {{two pairs of}} small humanoid aliens known as Bynars; the Bynars heavily rely on their computer technology and work in pairs for best efficiency. Much of the crew take shore leave while Picard, Riker and a skeleton crew remain aboard. Riker is intrigued by the Bynars' claimed upgrades to the holodeck and starts a program in a jazz bar. The program includes a woman named Minuet (Carolyn McCormick), by whom Riker is fascinated, both as a beautiful and charming woman, {{but also by the}} level of sophistication in her responses. Riker shortly returns, and Picard walks in on him kissing Minuet, and he too is <b>amazed</b> <b>by</b> the simulation.|$|E

25|$|Early European {{visitors}} were <b>amazed</b> <b>by</b> {{the quality of}} Japanese craftsmanship and metalsmithing. This {{stems from the fact}} that Japan itself is rather poor in natural resources found commonly in Europe, especially iron. Thus, the Japanese were famously frugal with their consumable resources; what little they had they used with expert skill.|$|E

25|$|To {{explain these}} facts, historians {{have pointed to}} the {{influence}} of Cantor's former professors, Karl Weierstrass and Leopold Kronecker. Cantor discussed his results with Weierstrass on December 23, 1873. Weierstrass was first <b>amazed</b> <b>by</b> the concept of countability, but then found the countability of the set of real algebraic numbers useful. Cantor did not want to publish yet, but Weierstrass felt that he must publish at least his results concerning the algebraic numbers.|$|E
25|$|Corydon {{tells him}} about {{his visit to the}} theatre.

Corydon describes the architecture and decorations of the theatre, and the many animals on show, some of which would leap out of trapdoors in the floor of the arena itself.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, Chichen Itza {{began to}} receive an influx of {{visitors}} {{on the day of}} the spring equinox.

Tourists are also <b>amazed</b> <b>by</b> the acoustics at Chichen Itza. For instance a handclap in front of the staircase of the El Castillo pyramid is followed by an echo that resembles the chirp of a quetzal as investigated by Declercq.|$|E

25|$|The {{seeds of}} Pop's stage persona were sown {{when he saw}} The Doors perform in 1967 at the University of Michigan and was <b>amazed</b> <b>by</b> the stage antics and {{antagonism}} displayed by singer Jim Morrison. Morrison's extreme behavior, while performing in a popular band, inspired the young Pop to push the boundaries of stage performance. Other influences on Pop's vocals and persona were Mick Jagger and James Brown. Pop was the first performer to do a stage-dive, which he started at a concert in Detroit. Pop, who traditionally performs bare-chested, also performed such stage theatrics as rolling around in broken glass and exposing himself to the crowd.|$|E
25|$|Arakawa {{wanted to}} {{integrate}} social problems into the story. Her research involved watching television news programs {{and talking to}} refugees, war veterans and former yakuza. Several plot elements, such as Pinako Rockbell caring for the Elric brothers after their mother dies, and the brothers helping people to {{understand the meaning of}} family, expand on these themes. When creating the fictional world of Fullmetal Alchemist, Arakawa was inspired after reading about the Industrial Revolution in Europe; she was <b>amazed</b> <b>by</b> differences in the culture, architecture, and clothes of the era and those of her own culture. She was especially interested in England during this period and incorporated these ideas into the manga.|$|E

Their relations with Don Javier remained extremely tense yet not broken; it was only after in November 1937 Arellano had accepted seat in a 50-member Consejo Nacional that the claimant declared him one of key rebels against his authority and expulsed them from Comunión Tradicionalista.|$|E
