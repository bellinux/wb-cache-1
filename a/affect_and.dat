5|$|Although {{cyclones}} take {{an enormous}} toll in lives and personal property, {{they may be}} important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they <b>affect</b> <b>and</b> bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions. Hurricanes in the eastern north Pacific often supply moisture to the Southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. Japan receives over half of its rainfall from typhoons. Hurricane Camille averted drought conditions and ended water deficits along much of its path, though it also killed 259people and caused $9.14billion (2005 USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{action of}} the {{magnetosphere}} traps and accelerates particles, producing intense belts of radiation similar to Earth's Van Allen belts, but thousands of times stronger. The interaction of energetic particles with the surfaces of Jupiter's largest moons markedly affects their chemical and physical properties. Those same particles also <b>affect</b> <b>and</b> {{are affected by the}} motions of the particles within Jupiter's tenuous planetary ring system. Radiation belts present a significant hazard for spacecraft and potentially to human space travellers.|$|E

The spatial region that we can <b>affect</b> <b>and</b> be affected by is the observable universe. The observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater region of spacetime than an observer who remains still. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler {{will not be able to}} interact with all of space. Typically, the observable universe is taken to mean the portion of the Universe that is observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way.|$|E

30|$|The {{size of the}} condyle unit {{showed the}} {{greatest}} discrepancy of length between the <b>affected</b> <b>and</b> non-affected side. The condyle length of the affected side was 32.7 – 26.8  mm (average 30.1  mm), while the non-affected control side was 45.2 – 34.8  mm (average 39.9  mm). And {{the difference between the}} size of <b>affected</b> <b>and</b> non-affected side ranged from 13.4 to 5.6  mm to make the size of affected side be 70 – 84  % of the non-affected size.

25|$|The {{relationship}} between negative <b>affect</b> <b>and</b> substance use disorders {{has been the}} most widely studied model of addiction. It proposes that individuals who experience the greatest levels of negative affect are at the greatest risk of using substances or behaviours as a coping (psychology) mechanism. Here, substances and behaviours are used to improve mood and distract from unpleasant feelings. Once physical dependence has been established, substance abuse is primarily motivated by a desire to avoid negative affective states associated with withdrawal. Individuals high in affective mood disorders (anxiety) most commonly report high levels of negative affect associated with cravings. The {{relationship between}} negative <b>affect</b> <b>and</b> addiction is not unidirectional. That is, while positive affect increases the likelihood of initiation of substance use, the negative affective states produced by withdrawal are the most commonly reported factors for continued use.|$|E

25|$|From a {{bottom-up}} perspective, happiness {{represents an}} accumulation of happy experiences. Bottom-up influences include external events, and broad situational and demographic factors, including health and marital status. Bottom-up approaches {{are based on the}} idea that there are universal basic human needs and that happiness results from their fulfilment. In support of this view, there is evidence that daily pleasurable events are associated with increased positive <b>affect,</b> <b>and</b> daily unpleasant events or hassles are associated with increased negative affect.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} explanation for more happiness among extraverts {{comes from the fact}} that extraverts are able to better regulate their affective states. This means that in ambiguous situations (situations where positive and negative moods are introduced and mixed in similar proportions) extraverts show a slower decrease of positive <b>affect,</b> <b>and,</b> as a result, they maintained a more positive affect balance than introverts. Extraverts may also choose activities that facilitate happiness (e.g., recalling pleasant vs. unpleasant memories) more than introverts when anticipating difficult tasks.|$|E

Globalizing processes <b>affect</b> <b>and</b> are affected by business and work organization, economics, socio-cultural resources, and the natural environment.

25|$|Research {{shows that}} religiosity moderates the {{relationship}} between “thinking about meaning of life” and life satisfaction. For individuals scoring low and moderately on religiosity, thinking {{about the meaning of}} life is negatively correlated with life satisfaction. For people scoring highly on religiosity, however, this relationship is positive. Religiosity has also been found to moderate {{the relationship between}} negative <b>affect</b> <b>and</b> life satisfaction, such that life satisfaction is less strongly influenced by the frequency of negative emotions in more religious (vs less religious) individuals.|$|E
25|$|COAs {{perceptions}} of their parents drinking habits influence their own future drinking patterns and are developed at an early age. Alcohol related expectancies are correlated with parental alcoholism and alcohol abuse among their offspring. Problem solving discussions in families with an alcoholic parent contained more negative family interactions than in families with non-alcoholics parents. Several factors related to parental alcoholism influence COA substance abuse including stress, negative <b>affect</b> <b>and</b> decreased parental monitoring. Impaired parental monitoring and negative affect correlate with COAs associating with peers that support drug use.|$|E
