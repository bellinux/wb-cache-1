50|$|The main compositionally {{differentiated}} {{zones in}} the solid Earth {{are the very}} dense iron-rich metallic core, the less dense magnesium-silicate-rich mantle and the relatively thin, light crust composed mainly of silicates of <b>aluminium,</b> <b>sodium,</b> calcium and potassium.

50|$|In geology, felsic {{refers to}} igneous rocks that are {{relatively}} rich in elements that form feldspar and quartz. It is contrasted with mafic rocks, which are relatively richer in magnesium and iron.

25|$|Soaps are key {{components}} of most lubricating greases, which are usually emulsions of calcium soap or lithium soap and mineral oil. Many other metallic soaps are also useful, including those of <b>aluminium,</b> <b>sodium,</b> and mixtures of them. Such soaps are also used as thickeners to increase the viscosity of oils. In ancient times, lubricating greases {{were made by the}} addition of lime to olive oil.|$|R
50|$|The {{minerals}} {{are arranged}} into layers that appear as bands in cross section. The appearance of layers, called compositional banding, occurs because the layers, or bands, are of different composition. The darker bands have relatively more mafic minerals (those containing more magnesium and iron). The lighter bands contain relatively more felsic (silicate minerals, containing {{more of the}} lighter elements, such as silicon, oxygen, <b>aluminium,</b> <b>sodium,</b> and potassium).|$|R

These are the main elements of obsidian glass [32, 33] and are responsible for their characteristic brown-black colour. The elemental composition of obsidians is the result of specific geological processes and can be chemically classified as peralkaline, subalkaline, metaluminous and peraluminous, according to their <b>aluminium,</b> calcium, <b>sodium</b> and potassium oxides content, respectively [32].|$|R

50|$|Electrometallurgy is {{the process}} of {{reduction}} of metals from metallic compounds to obtain the pure form of metal using electrolysis. <b>aluminium,</b> lithium, <b>sodium,</b> potassium, magnesium, calcium, and in some cases copper, are produced in this way.|$|R
25|$|Strong bases attack <b>aluminium.</b> <b>Sodium</b> {{hydroxide}} {{reacts with}} aluminium {{and water to}} release hydrogen gas. The aluminium takes the oxygen atom from sodium hydroxide, which in turn takes the oxygen atom from the water, and releases the two hydrogen atoms, The reaction thus produces hydrogen gas and sodium aluminate. In this reaction, sodium hydroxide acts as an agent to make the solution alkaline, which aluminium can dissolve in. This reaction {{can be useful in}} etching, removing anodizing, or converting a polished surface to a satin-like finish, but without further passivation such as anodizing or alodining the surface may become degraded, either under normal use or in severe atmospheric conditions.|$|R

50|$|Often as is {{the case}} with {{halloysite}} found in Juab County, Utah, United States the clay is found in close association with goethite and limonite and often interspersed with alunite. Feldspars are also subject to decomposition by water saturated with carbon dioxide. When feldspar occurs near the surface of lava flows, the CO2 concentration is high, and reaction rates are rapid. With increasing depth, the leaching solutions become saturated with silica, <b>aluminium,</b> <b>sodium,</b> and calcium. Once the solutions are depleted of CO2 they precipitate as secondary minerals. The decomposition is dependent on the flow of water. In the case that halloysite is formed from plagioclase it will not pass through intermediate stages.|$|R
