40|$|Generation {{of random}} numbers is a {{critical}} component of existing post-election <b>auditing</b> <b>techniques.</b> Recent work has largely discouraged the use of all pseudorandom number generators, including cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs), for this purpose, instead recommending the sole use of observable physical techniques. In particular, simple dice rolling has received a great deal of positive attention [4, 6, 9]. The typical justification for this recommendation is that those less comfortable with mathematics prefer a simple, observable technique. This paper takes a contrary view. Simple, observable techniques like dice rolling are not necessarily robust against sleight of hand and other forms of fraud, and attempts to harden them against fraud can dramatically increase their complexity. With simple dice rolling, we know of no techniques that provide citizens with a reasonable means of verifying that fraud did not occur during the roll process. CSPRNGs, used properly, can be simple, robust, and verifiable, and they allow for the use of <b>auditing</b> <b>techniques</b> that might otherwise be impractical. While we understand initial skepticism towards this option, we argue that appropriate use of CSPRNGs would strengthen audit security. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to review the {{state-of-the-art}} of <b>auditing</b> and control <b>techniques</b> applied to computerized information systems, particu-larly large-scale logistics information systems, and to present the findings as a basis for planning and organizing a research and development effort covering real-time software auditing and conventional process auditing of logistics information systems. The basic problem motivating this study is undue depletion of government assets caused by gross inefficiencies resulting from erroneous computerized recordkeeping, by assets being misappropriated through possible misuse of the computer, or by some combination of the two. The erroneous processing results may be caused by a combination of varied deficiencies, including incorrect input processing and latent computer program faults.

40|$|Thesis (MTech. {{degree in}} Business Information Systems) [...] Tshwane University of Technology 2011. Information systems {{are defined as}} a group of {{interconnected}} components (people, organisation and technology) that function together to extract, regain, route, accumulate and distribute information, with the aim of business decision making and operational activities in an organisation and other business. As a result, nformation systems are being deployed by organisation to help assure that their daily activities are completed seamlessly. Thus, organisational stakeholders invest a vast amount of money in the deployment of these systems. Furthermore, volumes of organisational data stored within these systems increases on regular basis. As the volume of data and the complexity of information systems increase, business managers expect information systems auditors to become even more relevant and rigorous as these auditors have to ensure that possible risks that these nformation systems may inherent are mitigated. International Auditing standards and best practices emphasise the use of Computer Aided <b>Audit</b> <b>Techniques</b> by IS auditors, within their audit engagements. However, the level of compliance to these international auditing standards and best practices by the South African information systems auditors is still questionable. An empirical study conducted by Vasile-Daniel (2010) indicated that even if technology is accepted, few (if not all) of nformation systems auditors still deploy traditional audit methods within their audit engagements. Currently, auditors were observed to use Computer Aided <b>Audit</b> <b>Techniques</b> only to select random test samples but not necessarily to audit entirely using Computer Aided <b>Audit</b> <b>Techniques.</b> That is, they often revert to executing their audit engagements following the traditional methods. To the preceding point, the present study sought to explore factors that could be influencing the nformation systems auditors not to utilize Computer Aided <b>Audit</b> <b>Techniques</b> fully. The study, underpinned by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), investigated the use or adoption of Computer Aided <b>Audit</b> <b>Techniques</b> by information systems auditors within a financial institution. The study revealed that senior management support, availability of resources, personal growth, increased productivity, and lack of relevant training tend to be the main factors, amongst others, influencing the use and adoption of Computer Aided <b>Audit</b> <b>Techniques...</b>|$|E
