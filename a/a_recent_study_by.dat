Furthermore, Cohen et al. found that participants' natural scene perception was impaired under dual-task conditions, but that this dual-task impairment happened only when participants' primary task was sufficiently demanding. The authors concluded that previous studies showing the absence of a need for focused attention did not use tasks that were demanding enough to fully engage attention.|$|E

They suggest that this reflects the characteristics of machivellianism – using glibness and manipulation to get what is wanted and it is argued that this is their way of controlling their partners. This is supported by the finding that females who are more controlling themselves will use more mate guarding resistant tactics too.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the disease risks, researchers believe these captive-reared monarchs are not as fit as wild ones, owing to the unnatural conditions they are raised in. Homeowners often raise monarchs in plastic or glass containers in their kitchens, basements, porches, etc., and under artificial lighting and controlled temperatures. Such conditions would not mimic what the monarchs are used to in the wild, and may result in adult monarchs that are unsuited for the realities of their wild existence. In support of this, <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>by</b> a citizen scientist found that captive-reared monarchs have a lower migration success rate than wild monarchs do.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>by</b> Roessler et al.

Seven of these clusters form a chain from the flavin to the quinone binding sites; the eighth cluster is located {{on the other side of}} the flavin, and its function is unknown. The EPR and DEER results suggest an alternating or “roller-coaster” potential energy profile for the electron transfer between the active sites and along the iron-sulfur clusters, which can optimize the rate of electron travel and allow efficient energy conversion in complex I.|$|E

25|$|Many misconceptions exist {{about what}} {{can help prevent}} hair loss, one of these being that lack of sexual {{activity}} will automatically prevent hair loss. While a proven direct correlation exists between increased frequency of ejaculation and increased levels of DHT, as shown in <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>by</b> Harvard Medical School, the study suggests that ejaculation frequency may be a sign, rather than a cause, of higher DHT levels. Another study shows that although sexual arousal and masturbation-induced orgasm increase testosterone concentration around orgasm, they reduce testosterone concentration on average (especially before abstinence) and because about 5% of testosterone is converted to DHT, ejaculation does not elevate DHT levels.|$|E
25|$|Statistics for German World War II {{military}} casualties are divergent and contradictory.
