5|$|During the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960), Britain was {{the first}} nation to employ the use of {{herbicides}} and defoliants to destroy bushes, trees, and vegetation to deprive insurgents of concealment and targeting food crops {{as part of a}} starvation campaign in the early 1950s. A detailed account of how the British experimented with the spraying of herbicides was written by two scientists, E.K.

5|$|After an {{extensive}} review of vineyard conditions {{in and around}} the existing Champagne region, INAO presented a proposal to revise the region on March 14, 2008. The proposal was prepared by a group of five experts in the subjects of history, geography, geology, phytosociology and <b>agronomy,</b> working from 2005. The proposal means expanding the region to cover vineyards in 357 rather than 319 villages. This is to be achieved by adding vineyards in forty villages while simultaneously removing two villages in the Marne départment that were included in the 1927 regulations, Germaine and Orbais-l'Abbaye.|$|E
5|$|As {{the college}} {{prepared}} for independence in 1953, Madgwick {{and his staff}} discussed establishing a farm-related degree program distinctive from the veterinary science degree offered at the University of Sydney. Madgwick journeyed to England and the United States to consult with agriculturalists, veterinarians, and specialists in animal husbandry. While Madgwick was gone, his deputy warden, James Belshaw, read a letter in the Australian Veterinary Journal from Gordon McClymont, a researcher in animal nutrition for the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, which advocated {{the establishment of a}} multi-disciplinary approach to farm science combining animal husbandry and <b>agronomy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Augustin Pyramus de Candolle also spelled Augustin Pyrame de Candolle (4 February 1778 – 9 September 1841) was a Swiss botanist. René Louiche Desfontaines {{launched}} de Candolle's botanical {{career by}} recommending him at an herbarium. Within {{a couple of}} years de Candolle had established a new genus, and he went on to document hundreds of plant families and create a new natural plant classification system. Although de Candolle's main focus was botany, he also contributed to related fields such as phytogeography, <b>agronomy,</b> paleontology, medical botany, and economic botany.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{provide the}} greater part of food for humans, and for their {{domestic}} animals. They have {{played a key role in}} the history of world civilizations. Agriculture includes <b>agronomy</b> for arable crops, horticulture for vegetables and fruit, and forestry for timber. About 7,000 species of plant have been used for food, though most of today's food is derived from only 30 species. The major staples include cereals such as rice and wheat, starchy roots and tubers such as cassava and potato, and legumes such as peas and beans. Vegetable oils such as olive oil provide lipids, while fruit and vegetables contribute vitamins and minerals to the diet.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of a reserve {{battalion}} during World War I, Himmler did not see active service. He studied <b>agronomy</b> in college, and joined the Nazi Party in 1923 and the SS in 1925. In 1929, he was appointed Reichsführer-SS by Hitler. Over the next 16 years, he developed the SS from a mere 290-man battalion into a million-strong paramilitary group, and, following Hitler's orders, set up and controlled the Nazi concentration camps. He was known to have good organisational skills and for selecting highly competent subordinates, such as Reinhard Heydrich in 1931. From 1943 onwards, he was both Chief of German Police and Minister of the Interior, overseeing all internal and external police and security forces, including the Gestapo (Secret State Police). Himmler had a lifelong interest in occultism, interpreting Germanic neopagan and Völkisch beliefs to promote the racial policy of Nazi Germany, and incorporating esoteric symbolism and rituals into the SS.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} two years, Norman Alexander spent time in both Singapore and New Zealand, whilst Elizabeth Alexander {{returned}} to England. In 1947, when the children {{were old enough to}} attend boarding school, the couple returned to Singapore, both working at Raffles College. In 1952, the couple moved to Ibadan, Nigeria, both accepting posts at University College Ibadan. Norman became the Chair of Physics, whilst Elizabeth took on the role of Lecturer in Soil Sciences. She worked in <b>Agronomy,</b> soil science, and administration. The university opened a department of geology in 1958 and appointed Dr. Elizabeth Alexander Senior Lecturer and Head of Department. Just three weeks into her new role, Alexander suffered a stroke and she died a week later on 15 October 1958 at the age of 49.|$|E
5|$|Zaimeche further {{observed}} that Islamic agricultural practice was documented by the mediaeval agronomists Muhammad bin Ibrāhīm Ibn Bassāl (11th century) of Toledo {{in his book}} Dīwān al-filāha (The Court of Agriculture), and Ibn al-'Awwam al-Ishbīlī of Seville in his book Kitāb al-Filāha (Treatise on Agriculture). Ibn Bassāl had travelled widely across the Islamic world, returning with a detailed knowledge of <b>agronomy.</b> His practical and systematic book describes over 180 plants and how to propagate and care for them, including leaf and root vegetables, herbs, spices and trees. Abū l-Khayr described in minute detail how olive trees should be grown, grafted, treated for disease, and harvested, and gave similar detail for crops such as cotton.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} the natural world {{extended}} to a detailed examination of plants. The work done was directly useful in the unprecedented growth of pharmacology across the Islamic world. Al-Dinawari popularised botany in the Islamic world with his six-volume Kitab al-Nabat (Book of Plants). Only volumes 3 and 5 have survived, with part of volume 6 reconstructed from quoted passages. In what survives, 637 plants are described in alphabetical order from the letters sin to ya, so the whole book must have covered several thousand kinds of plants. Al-Dinawari described the phases of plant growth and the production of flowers and fruit. Zakariya al-Qazwini's thirteenth century encyclopedia ʿAjā'ib al-makhlūqāt (The Wonders of Creation) contained, among many other topics, both realistic botany and fantastic accounts. For example, he described trees which grew birds on their twigs in place of leaves, but which could only be found in the far-distant British Isles. The use and cultivation of plants was documented in the 11th century by Muhammad bin Ibrāhīm Ibn Bassāl of Toledo in his book Dīwān al-filāha (The Court of Agriculture), and Ibn al-'Awwam al-Ishbīlī of Seville in his 12th century book Kitāb al-Filāha (Treatise on Agriculture).

25|$|With the {{exception}} of theoretical <b>agronomy,</b> research in <b>agronomy,</b> more {{than in any other}} field, is strongly related to local areas. It can be considered a science of ecoregions, because it is closely linked to soil properties and climate, which are never exactly the same from one place to another. Many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather, soil characteristics, and specific crops has to be studied locally. Others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible, and the human dimension of interaction with nature.|$|E
25|$|In 1855, when Luisa Maria of Borbone, {{sister of}} Maria Christina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies reopened the {{university}} of Parma, which had virtually closed its doors in 1849, Róndani became Professor of <b>Agronomy.</b> From this date the Prodromo began in earnest, as Róndani alternated teaching with research {{much of it in}} applied entomology. He also remarried this time to his cousin Elisa Gelati. Ten years Parma became part of the United Provinces of Central Italy, joining Tuscany, Modena and Piacenza). This led to changes in the university. The chair of <b>agronomy</b> was abolished and Róndani became emerito University professor of the University and insignito of the cross of the Saints Maurizio and Lazzaro. He became a natural history teacher in the R.? Grammar school and also Director of the Agrarian Institute where he taught <b>agronomy.</b> Róndani remained in both posts for the next ten years though the Institute passed to the Provincial Administration in 1865.|$|E

25|$|After Cornell, Harris {{traveled}} back to Logan {{to become}} a professor of <b>agronomy</b> and an agronomist at Utah State Agricultural College. In 1920, Harris was working {{as director of the}} Utah State Agricultural Experiment Station and was also head of the department of zoology and Entomology at Utah State Agricultural College (USAC). Although he held these administrative positions at USAC and was already the president of the American Society of <b>Agronomy,</b> the General Church Board of Education offered Harris the opportunity to take George H. Brimhall's place as president of Brigham Young University. After thinking about his decision for a week or so, he accepted the offer on April 22, 1921.

25|$|Guevara, {{who viewed}} {{the capture of}} the armored train as a priority, {{successfully}} mobilized the tractors {{of the school of}} <b>Agronomy</b> at the university to raise the rails of the railway. The train was therefore derailed as it transported troops away from the Capiro hill. The officers within tumbled out asking for a truce. At this, ordinary soldiers, whose morale was very low, began to fraternize with the rebels, saying that they were tired of fighting against their own people. Shortly afterwards the armored train was {{in the hands of the}} rebels and its 350 men and officers were transported as prisoners.|$|E
25|$|In 1833 Róndani {{married his}} first love, Petronilla, {{for whom he}} later named a new species of Ceria now Sphiximorpha petronillae.

It is roughly synonymous with ecophysiology, crop ecology, horticulture and <b>agronomy.</b> The particular name applied to the subdiscipline is specific to the viewpoint and goals of research. Whatever name is applied, it deals with the ways in which plants respond to their environment and so overlaps with the field of ecology.|$|E
25|$|The Cooperative Wheat Research Production Program, a {{joint venture}} by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexican Ministry of Agriculture, {{involved}} research in genetics, plant breeding, plant pathology, entomology, <b>agronomy,</b> soil science, and cereal technology.

Plant pathologist George Harrar recruited and assembled the wheat research team in late 1944. The four other members were soil scientist William Colwell; maize breeder Edward Wellhausen; potato breeder John Niederhauser; and Norman Borlaug, all from the United States. During the sixteen years Borlaug remained with the project, he bred a series of remarkably successful high-yield, disease-resistant, semi-dwarf wheat.|$|E

25|$|Drs Dayun Tao and Prapa Sripichitt, {{working at}} the Department of <b>Agronomy,</b> Kasetsart University, Bangkok, made {{numerous}} crosses between rice and wild, rhizomatous species. The difficulty of this work {{is illustrated by the}} case of the single successful hybrid they obtained between Oryza sativa and O. longistaminata. To get this one plant, 119 rice florets were pollinated, which produced 51 seeds. Of these seeds, 33 had culturable embryos, and only one of these embryos developed into a viable plant. Put another way, this hybridization was relatively easy: over 3000 pollinations had to be made between rice and O. rhizomatis to get a single viable plant. It was a fortunate cross in other respects: the hybrid was healthy and rhizomatous (it is still alive) and partially fertile, allowing F2 seed to be obtained.|$|E
25|$|Regarded by opponents as a {{folly of}} Marie Antoinette, the Hameau {{was a model}} bucolic village and farm in which {{advances}} in <b>agronomy</b> and animal husbandry were practiced.

Napoléon I presented the Petit Trianon to his mother, Letizia Buonaparte – a purely symbolic gesture as she never lived there. Louis-Philippe, in his turn, presented it to his wife, Marie Amélie, who refurbished the gardens and reappointed the house. In more recent times, the Petit Trianon and the Hameau de la reine have been undergoing an aggressive restoration program that is seeking to return them to their state when Marie-Antoinette left them in October 1789.|$|E
25|$|By 1943 this program, {{under the}} foundation's Mexican Agriculture Project, had proved such a {{success with the}} science of corn {{propagation}} and general principles of <b>agronomy</b> that it was exported to other Latin American countries; in 1956 the program was then taken to India; again with the geopolitical imperative of providing an antidote to communism. It wasn't until 1959 that senior foundation officials succeeded in getting the Ford Foundation (and later USAID, and later still, the World Bank) {{to sign on to}} the major philanthropic project, known now to the world as the Green Revolution. It was originally conceived in 1943 as CIMMYT, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in Mexico. It also provided significant funding for the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines.
