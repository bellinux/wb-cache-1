5|$|A typical French Christmas dish is {{turkey with}} chestnuts. Other common dishes are smoked salmon, oysters, caviar and foie gras. The Yule log {{is a very}} French {{tradition}} during Christmas. Chocolate <b>and</b> <b>cakes</b> also occupy a prominent place for Christmas in France.

5|$|Friday night (eve of Sabbath) dinners {{are usually}} family and {{socially}} oriented meals.

5|$|Granulated sugars {{are used}} at the table, to {{sprinkle}} on foods and to sweeten hot drinks (coffee and tea), and in home baking to add sweetness and texture to baked products (cookies <b>and</b> <b>cakes)</b> and desserts (pudding and ice cream). They are also used as a preservative to prevent micro-organisms from growing and perishable food from spoiling, as in candied fruits, jams, and marmalades.|$|E

5|$|In the Jewish {{communities}} of the Old Yishuv, bread was baked at home. Small commercial bakeries were {{set up in the}} mid-19th century. One of the earliest, Berman's Bakery, was established in 1875, and evolved from a cottage industry making home-baked bread <b>and</b> <b>cakes</b> for Christian pilgrims.|$|E

5|$|Local traditions include Lantern Night, {{which was}} held on 16 September and {{involved}} children in the town with candle lanterns made from hollowed out root vegetables such as Mangelwurzel or swede. It was the last remaining reminder of the Watchet Fair (also known as St Decuman's Fair). Another tradition is Queen Caturn's Day on the last Saturday of November. Watchet was famous for its blue dye and Queen Caturn was so impressed she bestowed the town's folk with cider <b>and</b> <b>cakes</b> {{as a reward for}} this. The tradition is carried on with costumes and celebrations.|$|E
5|$|South Wind Through the Kitchen (1997) was the {{completion}} {{of one of the}} projects of David's later years on which she worked with Norman: a single-volume collection of the best of her extensive writings. Norman invited chefs, writers and David's friends to choose their favourite of her articles and recipes. Many of the contributors, such as the chef Simon Hopkinson, contributed an introduction or afterword to the pieces they chose. The extracts and recipes are taken from all David's books published by 1996. There are more than 200 recipes, organised in the customary way with sections on courses and ingredients—eggs and cheese, fish and shellfish, meat, poultry and game, vegetables, pasta, pulses and grains, sauces, sweet dishes <b>and</b> <b>cakes,</b> preserves, and bread—interspersed, as in David's earlier works, with articles and essays. The title of the book comes from an essay published in 1964 and reprinted in An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, and is a reference to South Wind, a novel by David's mentor Norman Douglas.|$|E
5|$|By N42 and S89 the equestrian parade {{is at an}} end, and the {{following}} 16 figures on the north and 18 on the south are taken to be the elders of Athens judging by their braided hair, an attribute of distinguished age in Classical art. Four of these figures raise their right hand in a clenched fist gesture suggestive of a pose associated with the thallophoroi (olive branch bearers) who were older men chosen in competition for their good looks alone. No drill holes, however, exist for any branch to be inserted in their hands. Next in line (S107–114, N20–28) are the musicians: four kithara (a variant of the lyre) and four aulos (flute) players. N16–19 and S115–118 (conjectured) perhaps, as hydriaphoroi, the water-vessel carriers, here men, rather than metic girls mentioned {{in the literature on}} the Panathenaia. N13–15, S119–121 are the skaphephoroi, the tray bearers of the honeycombs <b>and</b> <b>cakes</b> used to entice the sacrificial animals to the altar. N1–12, S122–149 are the four cows and four sheep on the north and ten cows on the south meant for sacrifice on the acropolis, presumably an abbreviated form of the hecatomb usually offered on this occasion – there is an a-b-a rhythm of placid and restive cows.|$|E

25|$|For most foods, such as rice, {{the typical}} {{person would be}} unable to tell how it was cooked from looking at the final product. There are some differences, however: Bread <b>and</b> <b>cakes</b> brown on their tops instead of on the bottom. Compared to cooking over a fire, the food does not have a smoky flavor.|$|E
25|$|Whole {{poppy seeds}} {{are widely used}} as a spice and {{decoration}} in {{and on top of}} many baked goods. In North America they are used in and on many food items such as poppy seed muffins, rusk, bagels (like the Montreal-style bagel), bialys, <b>and</b> <b>cakes</b> such as sponge cake. Across Europe, buns and soft white bread pastries are often sprinkled on top with black and white poppy seeds (for example Cozonac, Kalach Kolache and, Kołacz).|$|E

25|$|Other than emmer, barley {{was grown}} to make bread and {{also used for}} making beer, and so were lily seeds and roots, and tiger nut. The grit from the quern stones used to grind the flour mixed in with bread was {{a major source of}} tooth decay due to the wear it {{produced}} on the enamel. For those who could afford there was also fine dessert bread <b>and</b> <b>cakes</b> baked from high-grade flour.|$|E
25|$|The {{playwright and}} novelist W. Somerset Maugham {{was sent to}} live with his uncle in Whitstable, at age 10, {{after the death of his}} parents. His novels Of Human Bondage (1915) <b>and</b> <b>Cakes</b> and Ale (1930) are set in the fictional town of Blackstable. It is likely that he based this town on Whitstable, as the names and {{description}} of places around Blackstable, including The Duke of Cumberland Inn and Joy Lane, are identical to places around Whitstable.|$|E
25|$|The gatherings {{followed}} a definite ritual. First {{one of the}} members would present a paper. Then, black coffee <b>and</b> <b>cakes</b> were served; cigar and cigarettes were on the table and were consumed in great quantities. After a social quarter of an hour, the discussion would begin. The last and decisive word was always spoken by Freud himself. There was the atmosphere of the foundation of a religion in that room. Freud himself was its new prophet who made the heretofore prevailing methods of psychological investigation appear superficial.|$|E

25|$|Carbohydrates {{are found}} {{in a wide variety}} of foods. The {{important}} sources are cereals (wheat, maize, rice), potatoes, sugarcane, fruits, table sugar (sucrose), bread, milk, etc. Starch and sugar are the important carbohydrates in our diet. Starch is abundant in potatoes, maize, rice and other cereals. Sugar appears in our diet mainly as sucrose (table sugar), which is added to drinks and many prepared foods such as jam, biscuits <b>and</b> <b>cakes,</b> and glucose and fructose which occur naturally in many fruits and some vegetables.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a custom}} {{in the region}} of Banat that, after Christmas Eve dinner, groups of {{children}} go from house to house of their neighborhood and sing to neighbors. This custom is called korinđanje, and the children who participate in it are called korinđaši. They knock on a neighbor's door or ring the doorbell; when the neighbor comes out they greet him, and ask if they are allowed to sing. If the answer is affirmative, they sing a children's ditty or the Troparion of the Nativity. As a reward, the neighbor gives them candies or even money; more traditional gifts include walnuts, prunes, apples, <b>and</b> <b>cakes.</b> Not only can Serbian children be korinđaši, but also Romanian and Hungarian ones.|$|E
25|$|Bread {{products}} are consumed {{all around the}} country. The deeply rooted bread, pastry, and dessert-making tradition derives from blending the above nationalities' products. Bakeries sell not only a wide scope of breads, cookies, <b>and</b> <b>cakes,</b> but also pastries. The latter resembles a sort of roll pastry whose main dough ingredient is either butter or fat and which may be simple or stuffed with dulce de leche, milk, jam, crema pastelera, or quince or apple jelly, among other fillings. The most popular type of pastry {{is said to be}} that of medialunas, based upon French croissants. Furthermore, sandwiches de miga are another type of bread products; they are made only with thin layers of white bread (generally referred to as crustless bread) and stuffed with food items ranging from ham and cheese to other more sophisticated combinations such as raw ham, tomatoes, olives, hard boiled eggs, tuna, lettuce, red pepper, and the like.|$|E
