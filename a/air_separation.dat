The other noble gases (except helium) are produced this way as well, but argon is the most plentiful by far. The bulk of argon applications arise simply because it is inert and relatively cheap.|$|E

In such refineries, the crude oil feedstock is a very complex multicomponent mixture that must be separated and yields of pure chemical compounds are not expected, only groups of compounds within a relatively small range of boiling points, which are called fractions. [...] These fractions are the origin of the term fractional distillation or fractionation.

Helium is sourced from natural gas fields which have high concentrations of helium in the natural gas, using cryogenic gas separation techniques, and radon is usually isolated from the radioactive decay of dissolved radium, thorium, or uranium compounds (since those compounds give off alpha particles). Noble gases have several important applications in industries such as lighting, welding, and space exploration. A helium-oxygen breathing gas is often used by deep-sea divers at depths of seawater over [...] to keep the diver from experiencing oxygen toxemia, the lethal effect of high-pressure oxygen, nitrogen narcosis, the distracting narcotic effect of the nitrogen in air beyond this partial-pressure threshold, and carbon dioxide poisoning (hypercapnia), the panic-inducing effect of excessive {{carbon dioxide in the}} bloodstream.

2500|$|In {{oxy-fuel}} combustion the fuel is burned in oxygen instead of air. To limit the resulting flame temperatures to levels common during conventional combustion, cooled flue gas is recirculated and {{injected into the}} combustion chamber. The flue gas consists of mainly carbon dioxide and water vapour, the latter of which is condensed through cooling. The result is an almost pure carbon dioxide stream that can be transported to the sequestration site and stored. Power plant processes based on oxyfuel combustion are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "zero emission" [...] cycles, because the [...] stored is not a fraction removed from the flue gas stream (as in the cases of pre- and post-combustion capture) but the flue gas stream itself. A certain fraction of the [...] generated during combustion will inevitably end up in the condensed water.

40|$|Abstract — In this study, a {{supervisory}} controller for an ASU (<b>Air</b> <b>Separations</b> Unit) {{has been}} designed based on a MPC (Model Predictive Control) approach. This {{has been applied to}} a detailed pressure-driven Aspen Plus/Aspen Dynamics model to understand the performance of a multivariable MPC when adopted for such a complex process with critical targets. In addition, an effective PI-based secondary-layered controller design has been proposed for open-loop stability and maxi-mizing oxygen yield. The rigorous Aspen model is interfaced with Matlab/Simulink and {{has been used as a}} “real plant” when performing the step tests for the identification of the simplified linear model and application of supervisory control. The effectiveness of the designed controller has been proved through the comparison between the linear MPC approach, that handles absolute and rate-of-change constraints, and a more conventional control configuration. The results show a significant reduction in overshoots and settling time during load variations. The paper clearly shows how the MPC approach for a supervisory control layer is reliable, easy to design and of real value for practical purposes. I...|$|R

The optimum gradient on our system is (1) 5 minutes, 47 % methanol/ 40 % acetonitrile/ 13 water in a linear gradient to (2) 17 minutes, 49 % methanol/ 40 % acetonitrile/ 11 % water to (3) 18 minutes, 29 % methanol/ 60 % acetonitrile/ 11 % water linearly to (4) 50 minutes, 31 % methanol/ 60 % acetonitrile/ 9 % water continued isocratically to 110 minutes.
