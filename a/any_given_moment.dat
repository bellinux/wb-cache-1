5|$|An episode {{featuring}} a storyline about a school shooting garnered the series {{an all-time high}} audience of 930,000 Canadian viewers. A second episode with a storyline about oral sex also earned just under 1,000,000 viewers. Overall, the season averaged an audience of 600,000 and was the top domestic drama for Canadian teenagers aged 12 to 17, and adults in three age brackets; ages 18 to 34, ages 18 to 49, and ages 25 to 54. In the US, the season received an 80% larger audience compared to season three, and one episode received 540,000 viewers and drew a Nielsen rating of 2.7 for teenagers and 4.7 for female teenagers, meaning that on average 2.7% of the nation's teenagers, and 4.7% of the nation's female teenagers were tuned in at <b>any</b> <b>given</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E

60|$|This {{argument}} {{is not quite}} easy to follow, {{and it is only}} valid as against the assumption that a finite time consists of a finite number of instants. We may re-state it in different language. Let us suppose three drill-sergeants, A, A′, and A″, standing in a row, while the two files of soldiers march past them in opposite directions. At the first moment which we consider, the three men B, B′, B″ in one row, and the three men C, C′, C″ in the other row, are respectively opposite to A, A′, and A″. At the very next moment, each row has moved on, and now B and C″ are opposite A′. Thus B and C″ are opposite each other. When, then, did B pass C′? It must have been somewhere between the two moments which we supposed consecutive, and therefore the two moments cannot really have been consecutive.

40|$|Game scoring,” that is, {{the act of}} {{composing}} {{music for}} and through gaming, is distinct from other types of scoring. To begin with, unlike other scoring activities, game scoring depends on — in fact, it arguably is — software programming. The game scorer’s choices are thus first-and-foremost limited by available gaming technology, and the “programmability” of their musical ideas given that technology, at <b>any</b> <b>given</b> historical <b>moment.</b> Moreover, game scores are unique in that they must allow for an unprecedented level of musical flexibility, given {{the high degree of}} user interactivity the video game medium enables and encourages. As such, game scoring necessarily constitutes an at least partially aleatoric compositional activity, the final score being determined as much through gameplay as traditional composition.

40|$|Context. TW Draconis {{is one of}} {{the most}} well known Algol-type eclipsing binaries. There is {{significant}} evidence for miscellaneous interacting physical processes in the system, which manifest themselves as for example period and light curve changes. We study time series data for the star accumulated over the past 150 years to detect changes in minima timings. Aims. Using 561 available minima timings, we compile an extended O–C diagram analysis. A detailed description of period changes allows us to construct the true phased light curve at any moment. Methods. By applying weighting nonlinear robust regression the timing residuals were analysed. The weights of individual types of minima were determined iteratively. The ephemeris are expressed in the orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal forms allowing us for example to determine directly uncertainties of photometric phases for <b>any</b> <b>given</b> <b>moments.</b> Results. The timing residuals (according to the linear ephemeris) display two stages of differing behaviour in 1858 – 2007. The first part ends around 1942. It is characterised by more or less smooth linear/parabolic course of timing residuals. In 1858 – 1905, the period was almost constant, but, in 1905 – 1942, the period increased with the rate of 5. 69 (5) 10 - 8 d year- 1. We interpret this as a result of continuous mass exchange between components at the mean rate of 6. 910 - 7 [*]year- 1. Since 1942, the system has been showing alternating and shortening period changes with the length of a cycle of about two decades, modulated by short-term periodic variations. The latter small variations with the period 6. 5 years are caused by the light-time effect due to the presence of a third low-mass body in the system. Major oscillations can be explained as consequences of quadrupole moment variation in the system...|$|R

40|$|According to Reinhart Koselleck, {{in every}} moment a congeries of “temporal strata” are {{effectively}} co-present, {{but not necessarily}} coherent, hence the “simultaneity of the nonsimultaneous. ” Contrast this {{with the notion of}} a zeitgeist in which every aspect of a historical moment is integrated by some master principle. There are so many trajectories active in any present that it is unlikely that one might coordinate all of them, if not unwise even to believe that they are coordinated. Not only does each historical present demonstrate at best rhizomic or patchy coherences across domains, but it also registers different paces and intensities in the temporal deployment of the domains. Nevertheless, coherence remains a compelling regulative ideal. Fortunately, path-dependency—cumulation as constraint—is a discriminable feature of the several distinct “layers of time” or diachronic flows co-present in <b>any</b> <b>given</b> historical <b>moment.</b> Moreover, that some strata of experience remain roughly constant enables us to appraise the variation of others.
