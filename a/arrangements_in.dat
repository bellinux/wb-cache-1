5|$|From 1921, {{the country}} had {{negotiated}} the Little Entente with Romania and Czechoslovakia {{in the face of}} Hungarian designs on its territory, and after a decade of bilateral treaties, had formalised the <b>arrangements</b> <b>in</b> 1933. This had been followed the following year by the Balkan Entente of Yugoslavia, Greece, Romania and Turkey, aimed at thwarting Bulgarian aspirations. Throughout this period, the Yugoslav government had sought to remain good friends with France, seeing her as a guarantor of European peace treaties. This was formalised through a treaty of friendship signed in 1927. With these <b>arrangements</b> <b>in</b> place, Italy posed the biggest problem for Yugoslavia, funding the anti-Yugoslav Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation which promoted Bulgarian irredentism. Attempts by King Alexander to negotiate with Benito Mussolini fell on deaf ears, and after Alexander's assassination, nothing of note happened on that front until 1937. In the aftermath of Alexander's assassination, Yugoslavia was isolated both militarily and diplomatically, and reached out to France to assist its bilateral relationship with Italy.|$|E
50|$|In 1901, the Cape Government Railways placed four 6th Class steam {{locomotives}} with a 2-6-2 Prairie {{type wheel}} <b>arrangement</b> <b>in</b> service. The engines were soon modified to a 2-6-4 Adriatic type wheel <b>arrangement.</b> <b>In</b> 1902, another four locomotives {{were placed in}} service, built with the 2-6-4 wheel arrangement. These latter four were the first tender locomotives {{in the world to}} be built with this wheel <b>arrangement.</b> <b>In</b> 1912, when they were assimilated into the South African Railways, these eight locomotives were renumbered and designated Class 6Z.|$|R

5|$|After {{composing}} the soundtracks for {{his first}} three best-known works, he formed his own video game production company, Sacnoth, {{for which he was}} the president and CEO. After producing and composing Koudelka in 1999, he left to become a freelance composer. Since his departure he has formed his own record label, Norstrilia, through which he produces albums of his own compositions and collaborations with other artists, as well as his previous scores. His music has been performed in concerts such as the Symphonic Fantasies concerts in Cologne, Germany in September 2009, and selections of his works have been published as piano <b>arrangements</b> <b>in</b> sheet music books.|$|E
5|$|Bloc Party {{aimed to}} create an album that appealed to {{followers}} of different musical genres. Building on the <b>arrangements</b> <b>in</b> their demo songs recorded in 2004, the band members moulded tracks largely through live takes during the Silent Alarm studio sessions. The compositional focus was on rhythm and the drum and bass parts, while lyricist Kele Okereke's writing examined the feelings and hopes of young adults, including views on global politics. Following the album's completion, Bloc Party embarked on promotional tours before its release.|$|E

5|$|From Leicester {{the march}} moved to Market Harborough. This {{was one of}} the least {{welcoming}} of all the overnight stops.

5|$|Ilaiyaraaja {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} Indian film composers to use Western classical music harmonies and string <b>arrangements</b> <b>in</b> Indian film music. This allowed him to craft a rich tapestry of sounds for films, and his themes and background score gained notice and appreciation among Indian film audiences. The range of expressive possibilities in Indian film music was broadened by Ilaiyaraaja's methodical approach to arranging, recording technique, and his drawing of ideas from a diversity of musical styles.|$|E
5|$|Relations with France were {{important}} after World War I {{and in the}} 1920s, as France {{played a leading role}} in the new European security <b>arrangements.</b> <b>In</b> the 1930s France started to fear the rise of Nazi Germany and initiated a rapprochement with the Soviet Union, which strained Franco-Finnish relations. However, during the Winter War France was one of the most important suppliers of military materiel.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers were {{consistent}} in their praises and {{criticism of the}} album.

5|$|The President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, {{discussed}} {{the matter of}} command <b>arrangements</b> <b>in</b> the Pacific in Washington, D.C., on 9 March.

Churchill responded favourably to the proposal, and the governments of Australia and New Zealand were then consulted. They endorsed the idea of an American supreme commander, but wanted to have some input into matters of strategy.|$|E
5|$|This {{conflict}} has led historians {{to take a}} number of positions on political <b>arrangements</b> <b>in</b> the province. Some have argued that Josephus' greater knowledge of Jewish affairs justifies favouring his account. M. Aberbach believes {{that there was a}} division of power, but that Tacitus reversed the governors' areas of authority and that Cumanus actually governed the south and Felix the north; this fits better with Josephus, who describes Cumanus as active in Jerusalem and nearby. Another suggestion is that part of the province was transferred to Felix after disturbances under Cumanus' rule.|$|E

The FIA released the Statement {{to the media and}} held a press conference in Brussels ridiculing the Commission’s case. The Commission argued that a number of commercial agreements could be viewed as anti-competition and invited the FIA and Ecclestone's companies, ISC and FOA, to submit proposals to modify these <b>arrangements.</b> <b>In</b> 2001, nine months after settlement talks had begun, the parties reached an agreement to amend existing contracts, which included Ecclestone stepping down as the FIA's vice-president of promotional affairs and the FIA ending all involvement in the commercial activities of Formula One.|$|E

5|$|Dangerous or not, Bache {{soon began}} a lifelong crusade to win {{popularity}} for Liszt's works in England. In 1865 {{he began a}} series of annual concerts in conjunction with singer Gustave Garcia. They began modestly, in Collard's Rooms, Grosvenor Street. As they increased in popularity, they were relocated to the more spacious Beethoven Rooms in Cavendish Square, then to the Queen's Concert Rooms in Hanover Square, and finally to St. James's Hall in Regents Square. At first these concerts were of instrumental and chamber works and piano <b>arrangements.</b> <b>In</b> 1868, they had grown to include choral works, which allowed pieces such as Liszt's Soldatenlied and choruses from Wagner's Tannhäuser and Lohengrin to be programmed. By 1871, the concerts had been changed to an orchestral format.|$|E
5|$|F. During the series, it was {{revealed}} that the Victoria club had not filed a formal challenge. A letter arrived from the Stanley Cup trustees on March 17, stating that the trustees would not let the Stanley Cup travel west, as they did not consider Victoria a proper challenger because they had not formally notified the trustees. However, on March 18, Trustee William Foran stated that it was a misunderstanding. PCHA president Frank Patrick had not filed a challenge, because he had expected Emmett Quinn, president of the NHA to make all of the <b>arrangements</b> <b>in</b> his role as hockey commissioner, whereas the trustees thought they were being deliberately ignored. In any case, all arrangements had been ironed out and the Victoria challenge was accepted.|$|E
