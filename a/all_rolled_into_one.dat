It is true that society may make physical claims on the child as well as mental ones: the child must learn to walk, to use a knife and fork, to swim, to ride a bicycle, to acquire sufficient power of self-defence to make an attack on it an arduous and uncertain enterprise, perhaps to fly.

40|$|The {{nexus of}} science and society ” is a phrase that can be {{interpreted}} in multiple ways. As participants in this meeting, {{some of you may}} have been asking yourselves: How, exactly, was this theme derived? Does the “nexus ” refer to the manner in which sci-entif ic advances address fundamental human needs? Does it refer to the role scien-tists, themselves, play in various sectors of society, as researchers, discoverers, inven-tors, educators, government leaders, lobby-ists, and concerned citizens? Could this nexus refer to the cross-disci-plinary, multisector partnerships that syner-gize our best scientific innovation? Or is it the impact that science exerts on other aspects of society, such as national security, economic prosperity, health care, and the overall quality of life? Is not the real nexus simply the way in which scientific viewpoints influence the public policy debate?” The answer, of course, is yes. That is pre-cisely what is meant. The nexus is <b>all</b> these ideas, <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> <b>one.</b> The role that science and scientists play in society—the degree of influence wielded by scientific opinion, the reputation of scien-tific bodies for impartially rendered insight, the priority accorded to scientific research and education—has been vital to our success as a nation, nearly on a par with our demo-cratic principles and ethical precepts.

60|$|The {{differences}} between Prometheus Unbound and The Ring are {{as interesting as}} the likenesses. Shelley, caught in the pugnacity of his youth and the first impetuosity of his prodigious artistic power by the first fierce attack of the New Reformation, gave no quarter to the antagonist of his hero. His Wotan, whom he calls Jupiter, is the almighty fiend into whom the Englishman's God had degenerated during two centuries of ignorant Bible worship and shameless commercialism. He is Alberic, Fafnir Loki and the ambitious side of Wotan <b>all</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> <b>one</b> melodramatic demon who is finally torn from his throne and hurled shrieking into the abyss by a spirit representing that conception of Eternal Law which has been replaced since by the conception of Evolution. Wagner, an older, more experienced man than the Shelley of 1819, understood Wotan and pardoned him, separating him tenderly from all the compromising alliances to which Shelley fiercely held him; making the truth and heroism which overthrow him the children of his inmost heart; and representing him as finally acquiescing in and working for his own supersession and annihilation. Shelley, in his later works, is seen progressing towards the same tolerance, justice, and humility of spirit, as he advanced towards the middle age he never reached. But there is no progress from Shelley to Wagner as regards the panacea, except that in Wagner {{there is a certain}} shadow of night and death come on it: nay, even a clear opinion that the supreme good of love is that it so completely satisfies the desire for life, that after it the Will to Live ceases to trouble us, and we are at last content to achieve the highest happiness of death.|$|E
