5|$|Sparrows {{tend to be}} small, plump, {{brownish}} or greyish {{birds with}} short tails and short, powerful beaks. They are seed-eaters <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> consume small insects. There are about 38 species worldwide, two {{of which have been}} recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{costs of the}} war were high {{in some of the}} southern English colonies, including those that saw little military activity. Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania to a lesser extent, were hit hard by the cost of shipping their export products (primarily tobacco) to European markets, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> suffered because of several particularly bad harvests. South Carolina accumulated a significant debt burden to finance military operations.|$|E

5|$|As {{a reserve}} unit, the {{formation}} {{is not in}} existence on a permanent basis, but is instead only called upon when needed. The brigade's Headquarters and Headquarters Company is located in Gaithersburg, and it commands two other reserve military police battalions. These are the 336th Military Police Battalion and the 400th Military Police Battalion. The brigade commands numerous smaller company sized reserve military police units throughout the country. These units deploy to foreign theaters of operations with the brigade when it is called upon, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> deploy to various installations throughout the United States when needed for participation in training and readiness exercises.|$|E
5|$|Danish workers {{involved}} in the clean-up operation claimed long-term health problems resulted from their exposure to the radiation. Although they did not work at Camp Hunziker, the Danes worked at the Tank Farm where the contaminated ice was collected, in the port where the contaminated debris was shipped from, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> serviced the vehicles used in the clean-up. It {{is also possible that}} they were exposed to radiation in the local atmosphere. Many of the workers surveyed in the years following Project Crested Ice reported health problems. A 1995 survey found 410 deaths by cancers out of a sample of 1,500 workers.|$|E

5|$|Electrons play an {{essential}} role in numerous physical phenomena, such as electricity, magnetism, chemistry and thermal conductivity, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> participate in gravitational, electromagnetic and weak interactions. Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding electric field, and if that electron is moving relative to an observer it will generate a magnetic field. Electromagnetic fields produced from other sources (not those self-produced) will affect the motion of an electron according to the Lorentz force law. Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when they are accelerated. Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as electron plasma by the use of electromagnetic fields. Special telescopes can detect electron plasma in outer space. Electrons are involved in many applications such as electronics, welding, cathode ray tubes, electron microscopes, radiation therapy, lasers, gaseous ionization detectors and particle accelerators.|$|E
5|$|Galiella rufa {{produces}} several structurally related hexaketide {{compounds that}} have attracted attention for their biological properties: pregaliellalactone, galiellalactone. The compounds have anti-nematodal activity, killing the nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans and Meloidogyne incognita. These compounds {{have been shown}} in laboratory tests to inhibit the early steps of the biosynthetic pathways induced by plant hormones known as gibberellic acids, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> inhibit the germination of seeds of several plants. Galiellalactone is additionally a highly selective and potent inhibitor of interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling in HepG2 cells. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine which is produced by a large variety of cells and functions as a regulator of immune response, acute phase reactions, and hematopoiesis. Researchers {{are interested in the}} potential of small-molecule inhibitors (such as the ones produced by G.rufa) to interfere with the IL-6 signaling cascade that leads to the expression of genes involved in disease.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton assumed {{control in}} the War department, and the rift between Adams' and Hamilton's {{supporters}} widened. Many sought to vest Hamilton with command authority over the army, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> resisted giving prominent Democratic-Republicans positions in the army, which Adams wanted {{to do in order}} to gain bipartisan support. By building a large standing army, Hamilton's supporters raised popular alarms and played into the hands of the Democratic-Republicans. They also alienated Adams and his large personal following. They shortsightedly viewed the Federalist party as their own tool and ignored the need to pull together the entire nation in the face of war with France. Overall, however, patriotic sentiments and a series of naval victories, popularized the war as well as the president.|$|E

5|$|In {{the music}} video, {{it begins with}} an {{out-of-focus}} view of Wade, seemingly alone, coming up a hill towards the camera. When he stops and starts singing, the camera comes into focus and the other band members come out from behind him and start lip-synching his vocals. A group of people (In which {{one of them is}} YouTube star, Wendy McColm) pull up in cars <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> lip-synch the song, in addition to performing other activities throughout the video. The video's effects allow people to seemingly appear out of nowhere throughout the video.|$|E
5|$|J. Keijzer {{replaced}} de Vries {{after the}} latter's death in 1887 and headed {{the church for}} seven years. During his tenure, the church and surrounding grounds were expanded significantly. Construction of a multi-story presbytery began in the 1880s and completed on 1 August 1890. Across the street, in 1888 the nuns established an elementary school, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> began construction of a chapel for the convent, which was opened on 6 August 1892. During this period the church building received stained glass windows and new pews. Further construction continued into the 20th century. A pipe organ was installed in 1903; it was restored in 1993, but remains in poor condition. Also installed that year were carvings depicting the fourteen Stations of the Cross.|$|E
5|$|Mamie Till Bradley and Emmett lived {{together}} in a busy neighborhood in Chicago's South Side, near distant relatives. She began working as a civilian clerk for the U.S. Air Force for a better salary. She recalled that Emmett was industrious enough to help with chores at home, although he sometimes got distracted. His mother remembered {{that he did not}} know his own limitations at times. Following the couple's separation, Bradley visited Mamie and began threatening her. At eleven years old, Emmett, with a butcher knife in hand, told Bradley he would kill him if the man did not leave. Usually, however, Emmett was happy. He and his cousins and friends pulled pranks on each other (Emmett once took advantage of an extended car ride when his friend fell asleep and placed the friend's underwear on his head), <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> spent their free time in pickup baseball games. He was a natty dresser and was often the center of attention among his peers.|$|E

5|$|Migrating birds rely {{largely on}} stored fat <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> metabolise protein as a {{supplementary}} source of energy. Those {{with a relatively}} large amount of fat, may make stops during migration of only 1â€“2 days; although they have lost weight since commencing their journey, they have enough energy reserves to reach the wintering areas. The proportion of migrating males increases as they travel south through Europe. There is competition within the species even during migration, and the larger and more aggressive males may get more food. Their death rate is therefore {{lower than that of}} the females both on the southward migration, and in resident populations.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia nigrocincta, {{commonly}} known as the jumper ant or jumping jack, is an ant of the genus Myrmecia. The species was first described by Frederick Smith in 1858. Colonies of this ant are abundant in eastern Australia. Ants of this species are known for their ability to jump several inches, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> have a powerful, venomous sting. Rather than foraging on the ground, M. nigrocincta prefer to forage in trees where they are known to pollinate certain flowers.|$|E
5|$|Neil {{stated that}} her {{motivation}} for the project was a desire to create a video game in which the asylum seekers were the heroes. The purpose of the game, according to Neil, was twofold. The team wanted to criticise the treatment of detained asylum seekers in Australia, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> wanted to prove that video games were capable of the task. At the time, the idea that video games could convey political topics in a serious manner, {{and that they were}} a form of culture worth being taken seriously, had not caught on strongly. The game also was a statement against the Australian government's attempts to suppress media access to, and coverage of, the detention facilities.|$|E
