50|$|Before {{a gun or}} {{launcher}} {{could be}} aimed {{it had to be}} oriented in a known azimuth, or at least towards the target area. There were various methods for this. Initially, the angle between the aiming point and target area was deduced or estimated and this angle set on the <b>azimuth</b> <b>sight,</b> each gun then laid on the aiming point with this angle (sometimes corrected for each gun to keep them aimed roughly parallel to each other). However, for artillery another instrument, called either a director (UK) or aiming circle (US), became widespread and eventually the primary method of orienting guns in most if not all armies. After being oriented and pointed in the required direction a gun recorded angles to one or more aiming points.|$|E
40|$|Synthetic {{aperture}} radar {{images have}} been successfully used as a tool in {{a whole variety of}} geological works and studies. These images enhance the topography (macro-topography) and superficial roughness (microtopography), and also provide geological information for structures enhancement, rock types and geobotanical patterns. Therefore, the objective of this research was to evaluate the potential of set of RADARSAT- 1 satellite images for extracting geological information. Images were acquired under different incidences angles, look directions and spatial resolution at the Curaçá River Valley region using the principal component analysis. This multivariate procedure had as the input channel one image in Fine mode and three images in Standard mode, all with the same pixel spacing. Then, correlation matrices, eigenvalues and eigenvectors were evaluated to characterize the influence of the sensor parameters (incidence angle and look directions variations) in targets discriminations. As a result, the visual analyses of principal component images satisfactorily delimited the main rock types and structures in the region and shows that the <b>azimuth</b> <b>sight</b> variation is more relevant than the incidence angle in this type of flat, semi-arid dry terrain with spare caatinga vegetation with abundant residual soil exposure environment.

50|$|Artillery uses angular {{measurement}} in gun laying, the azimuth between {{the gun and}} its target many kilometres away and the elevation angle of the barrel. This means that artillery uses mils to graduate indirect fire <b>azimuth</b> <b>sights</b> (called dial sights or panoramic telescopes), their associated instruments (directors or aiming circles), their elevation sights (clinometers or quadrants), together with their manual plotting devices, firing tables and fire control computers.|$|R

50|$|The second group, or Ayanami class, {{were built}} in 1930 and 1931, and had larger bridges that {{encompassed}} the rangefinder, an <b>azimuth</b> compass <b>sighting</b> device and the gun-fire control room, {{as well as a}} range finding tower. Furthermore, the boiler room's air inlet　was changed from a pipe to a bowl shape. They also benefited from the deployment of “Type B” turrets, which could elevate each gun separately to 75° for AA use, making them the world's first destroyers with this capability.|$|R
5000|$|NATO defines {{indirect}} fire as [...] "Fire delivered at a target which cannot {{be seen by}} the aimer." [...] The implication is that azimuth and/or elevation 'aiming' is done using instrumental methods. Hence {{indirect fire}} means applying 'firing data' to <b>azimuth</b> and elevation <b>sights</b> and laying these sights. Indirect fire can be used when the target is visible from the firing position. However, it is mostly used when the target is at longer range and invisible to the firer due to the terrain. Longer range uses a higher trajectory, and in theory maximum range is achieved with an elevation angle of 45 degrees.|$|R
30|$|One of {{the largest}} of slope {{failures}} is a 6  km 2 patch within the river catchment on the northwestern side of Mt. Kinabalu. Another large failure is a 5  km 2 patch on the southern flank of Mt. Kinabalu. The match between the radar and optical interpretations is better on the northern slope than on the southern slope. This likely results from the line of <b>sight</b> <b>azimuth</b> of the ALOS- 2 data, as Mt. Kinabalu’s southern slope is nearly parallel to ALOS- 2 ’s line of sight, so {{it is more likely}} that not all the incoherence reflects actual changes in the slope.|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} for a mle 1931 in fixed emplacements was a JM Reibel twin-mount, complete with telescopic <b>sight,</b> <b>azimuth</b> and level indicators, elevation screw and spent case ejection chutes. It was manned by {{a crew of}} eight, including two gunners, two loaders, two assistant loaders (to fetch ammunition and reload pan magazines with a table-mounted reloading machine that took standard 5-round stripper clips), a mechanic to repair any faults or jams, and a commander to direct or coordinate fire. The purpose of pairing the guns was to allow for sustained and rapid fire. During normal use, the two guns would be fired in turn, allowing the other gun time to cool down. When called for, both guns could be fired together, increasing instantaneous rate of fire. Charts were posted on the walls in each emplacement, outlining standard operating technique: ...|$|R
40|$|Fixed-target unpolarized Drell-Yan {{experiments}} often feature {{an acceptance}} {{depending on the}} polar angle of the lepton tracks in the laboratory frame. Typically leptons are detected in a defined angular range, with a dead zone in the forward region. If the cutoffs imposed by the angular acceptance are independent of the <b>azimuth,</b> at first <b>sight</b> they do not appear dangerous for a measurement of the cos(2 ϕ) -asymmetry, relevant because of its association with the violation of the Lam-Tung rule and with the Boer-Mulders function. On the contrary, direct simulations show that up to 10 percent asymmetries are produced by these cutoffs. These artificial asymmetries present qualitative features {{that allow them to}} mimic the physical ones. They introduce some model-dependence in the measurements of the cos(2 ϕ) -asymmetry, since a precise reconstruction of the acceptance in the Collins-Soper frame requires a Monte Carlo simulation, that in turn requires some detailed physical input to generate event distributions. Although experiments in the eighties seem to have been aware of this problem, the possibility of using the Boer-Mulders function as an input parameter in the extraction of Transversity has much increased the requirements of precision on this measurement. Our simulations show that the safest approach to these measurements is a strong cutoff on the Collins-Soper polar angle. This reduces statistics, but does not necessarily decrease the precision in a measurement of the Boer-Mulders function. Comment: 13 pages, 14 figure...|$|R
