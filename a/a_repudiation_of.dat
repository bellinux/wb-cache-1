5|$|Nash {{strongly}} opposed {{the relocation of}} South Melbourne Football Club to Sydney (renamed the Sydney Swans) in 1981, considering it <b>a</b> <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> the proud South Melbourne he had helped create. Nash stated that he had given fifty years to South Melbourne but due to the relocation they had now lost him forever and refused to attend Swans matches for many years, relenting only {{shortly before his death}} to attend a match between Sydney and Footscray.|$|E
5|$|The {{inaugural address}} was a {{detailed}} {{statement of the}} Whig agenda, essentially <b>a</b> <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> Jackson and Van Buren's policies. Harrison promised to reestablish the Bank of the United States and extend its capacity for credit by issuing paper currency (Henry Clay's American system); to defer to the judgment of Congress on legislative matters, with sparing use of his veto power; and to reverse Jackson's spoils system of executive patronage. He promised to use patronage to create a qualified staff, not to enhance his own standing in government.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt was {{receiving}} many letters from supporters {{urging him to}} run, and Republican office-holders were organizing on his behalf. Balked on many policies by an unwilling Congress and courts in his full term in the White House, he saw manifestations of public support he believed would sweep him to the White House with a mandate for progressive policies that would brook no opposition. In February, Roosevelt announced he would accept the Republican nomination if it was offered to him. Taft felt that if he lost in November, it would be <b>a</b> <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> the party, but if he lost renomination, {{it would be a}} rejection of himself. He was reluctant to oppose Roosevelt, who helped make him president, but having become president, he was determined to be president, and that meant not standing aside to allow Roosevelt to gain another term.|$|E

5|$|Barkley {{supported}} Franklin D. Roosevelt for the Democratic {{presidential nomination}} in 1932, but facing a re-election bid himself, {{he did not}} announce his support, fearing that his message might not resonate with Kentucky voters. Roosevelt supporters offered Barkley the keynote address and temporary chairmanship of the 1932 Democratic National Convention if he would endorse their candidate. Both opportunities would help Barkley's re-election chances, so he announced his support for Roosevelt on March 22, 1932. In his keynote, Barkley warmly recalled the Wilson administration and denounced {{more than a decade}} of Republican dominance. Applause frequently punctuated the speech, with the longest interruption – a 45-minute near-riot – erupting after Barkley called for a platform plank directing Congress to repeal prohibition. According to Libbey, the remark was not <b>a</b> <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> his prohibitionist position but a desire for the people to express their will on repeal. Prohibitionist constituents still supported Barkley because, for most of them, the depression trumped all other concerns.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{his earlier}} battle with Stevens, Blaine {{led the fight}} in Congress for a strong dollar. After the {{issuance}} of 150 million dollars in greenbacks—non-gold-backed currency—the {{value of the dollar}} stood at a low ebb. A bipartisan group of inflationists, led by Republican Benjamin F. Butler and Democrat George H. Pendleton, wished to preserve the status quo and allow the Treasury to continue to issue greenbacks and even to use them to pay the interest due on pre-war bonds. Blaine called this idea <b>a</b> <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> the nation’s promise to investors, which was made when the only currency was gold. Speaking several times on the matter, Blaine said that the greenbacks had only ever been an emergency measure to avoid bankruptcy during the war. Blaine and his hard money allies were successful, but the issue remained alive until 1879, when all remaining greenbacks were made redeemable in gold by the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875.|$|E
5|$|The Report was {{received}} warmly by Virginia Democratic-Republicans. The General Assembly arranged for five thousand copies to be printed and {{distributed in the}} state, but {{there was not much}} public response to the Report, and it appears to have had relatively little impact on the presidential election of 1800 (which was, nevertheless, a major victory for the Democratic-Republicans and <b>a</b> <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> Federalist policies). Parties outside Virginia seemed uninterested in the rehashing of the 1798 Resolutions, and in other states there was very little public comment. Jefferson eagerly sought copies for distribution to Democratic-Republican members of Congress departing for their home states, and when they failed to arrive he entreated Monroe for at least one copy that he could reproduce. Despite Jefferson's approval of and attempt to distribute Madison's work, the national reaction was tepid. Though it had little impact on the immediate election, Madison's Report clarified the legal argument against the Acts and for states' rights in general, particularly in its advancement of the Tenth Amendment rather than the Ninth as the main bulwark against federal encroachment on state autonomy.|$|E

25|$|The band's {{focus on}} a guitar, bass, and drum sound, and their fusion of 1960s rock and post-punk, were <b>a</b> <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> synthesiser-based {{contemporary}} dance-pop – the style popular in the 1980s. Marr's guitar work, using a Rickenbacker, often had a jangle pop sound reminiscent of Roger McGuinn of the Byrds, and influenced later Manchester bands including the Stone Roses and Oasis. Morrissey's complex, literate lyrics combined themes about ordinary people with mordant humour. In 2014 and 2015, they were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.|$|E
25|$|The AWSA and NWSA {{executive}} committees met separately beforehand {{to discuss}} their choices {{for president of the}} united organization. At the AWSA meeting, Henry Blackwell, Stone's husband, said the NWSA had agreed to avoid mixing in side issues (the approach associated with Stanton) and to focus exclusively on suffrage (the approach of the AWSA and increasingly of Anthony). The executive committee recommended that AWSA delegates vote for Anthony. At the NWSA meeting, Anthony strongly urged its members not to vote for her but for Stanton, saying that a defeat of Stanton would be viewed as <b>a</b> <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> her role in the movement.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s, most {{progressives}} came to {{view the}} business culture of the day not as <b>a</b> <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> progressive goals but as the fulfillment of it. The most important progressive victories of 1921 were the passage of administrative reorganization laws, the King Bill, increasing corporate taxes, and a progressive budget. In 1927–31, governor Clement Calhoun Young (1869–1947) brought more progressivism to the state. The state began large-scale hydroelectric power development, and began state aid to the handicapped. California became {{the first state to}} enact a modern old-age pension law. The state park system was upgraded, and California (like most states) rapidly expanded its highway program, funding it through a tax on gasoline, and creating the California Highway Patrol.|$|E
25|$|In the November 2005 off-year elections, New York City, Republican mayoral {{candidate}} Michael Bloomberg won {{a landslide}} re-election, the fourth straight Republican victory {{in what is}} otherwise a Democratic stronghold. In California, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger failed {{in his effort to}} use the ballot initiative to enact laws the Democrats blocked in the state legislature. Scandals prompted the resignations of Congressional Republicans House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, Duke Cunningham, Mark Foley and Bob Ney. In the 2006 midterm elections, the Republicans lost control of both the House of Representatives and Senate to the Democrats in what was widely interpreted as <b>a</b> <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> the administration's war policies. Exit polling suggested that corruption was a key issue for many voters. Soon after the elections, Donald Rumsfeld resigned as secretary of defense to be replaced by Bob Gates.|$|E
25|$|After Anna died in 1882, in 1884 Douglass married again, to Helen Pitts, a white suffragist and {{abolitionist}} from Honeoye, New York. Pitts was {{the daughter}} of Gideon Pitts Jr., an abolitionist colleague and friend of Douglass. A graduate of Mount Holyoke College (then called Mount Holyoke Female Seminary), Pitts worked on a radical feminist publication named Alpha while living in Washington, D.C. The marriage provoked a storm of controversy, since Pitts was both white and nearly 20 years younger than Douglass. Her family stopped speaking to her; his children considered the marriage <b>a</b> <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> their mother. However, feminist Elizabeth Cady Stanton congratulated the couple. Douglass responded to the criticisms by saying that his first marriage had been to someone the color of his mother, and his second to someone the color of his father.|$|E
25|$|A key {{provision}} {{of each of}} the laws respectively organizing the Territory of New Mexico and the Territory of Utah was that slavery would be decided by local option, called popular sovereignty.

25|$|Following the Church's exaltation of {{the marital}} act of sexual {{intercourse}} between a baptised man and woman within sacramental marriage as proper and exclusive to the sacrament of marriage, John Paul II believed that it was, in every instance, profaned by contraception, abortion, divorce followed by a 'second' marriage, and by homosexual acts. In 1994, John Paul II asserted the Church's lack of authority to ordain women to the priesthood, stating that without such authority ordination is not legitimately compatible with fidelity to Christ. This was also deemed <b>a</b> <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> calls to break with the constant tradition of the Church by ordaining women to the priesthood. In addition, John Paul II chose not to end the discipline of mandatory priestly celibacy, although in {{a small number of}} unusual circumstances, he did allow certain married clergymen of other Christian traditions who later became Catholic to be ordained as Catholic priests.|$|E
25|$|In its {{late 1990s}} incarnation, One Nation called for zero net immigration, {{an end to}} {{multiculturalism}} and a revival of Australia's Anglo-Celtic cultural tradition which it says has been diminished, the abolition of native title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), an end to special Aboriginal funding programs, opposition to Aboriginal reconciliation which the party says will create two nations, and {{a review of the}} 1967 constitutional referendum which gave the Commonwealth power to legislate for Aborigines. The party's economic position was to support protectionism and trade retaliation, increased restrictions on foreign capital and the flow of capital overseas, and a general reversal of globalisation's influence on the Australian economy. Domestically, One Nation opposed privatisation, competition policy, and the GST, while proposing a government subsidised people's bank to provide 2 per cent loans to farmers, small business, and manufacturers. On foreign policy, One Nation called for a review of Australia's United Nations membership, <b>a</b> <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> Australia's UN treaties, an end to foreign aid and to ban foreigners from owning Australian land.|$|E
25|$|Some slaveholders made {{a profit}} by selling surplus slaves to traders for {{transport}} {{to the markets}} of the Deep South, where the demand was still high for field hands on cotton plantations. In contrast to the near-unanimity of voters in the seven cotton states in the lower South, which held {{the highest number of}} slaves, the border slave states were bitterly divided about secession and were not eager to leave the Union. Border Unionists hoped that a compromise would be reached, and they assumed that Lincoln would not send troops to attack the South. Border secessionists paid less attention to the slavery issue in 1861, since their states' economies were based more on trade with the North than on cotton. Their main concern in 1861 was federal coercion; some residents viewed Lincoln's call to arms as <b>a</b> <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> the American traditions of states' rights, democracy, liberty, and a republican form of government. Secessionists insisted that Washington had usurped illegitimate powers in defiance of the Constitution, and thereby had lost its legitimacy. After Lincoln issued a call for troops, Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas, and North Carolina promptly seceded and joined the Confederacy. A secession movement began in western Virginia, where most farmers were yeomen and not slaveholders, to break away and remain in the Union.|$|E
