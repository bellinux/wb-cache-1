50|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that writing and terminology about racism, including about <b>Afrophobia</b> has been somewhat U.S.-centric. In 2016, <b>Afrophobia</b> {{has been used as}} a term for racism against darker-skinned persons in China. In such usage <b>Afrophobia</b> is an inexact term, because the racism is directed against darker-skinned persons from anywhere, without regard to any connection to Africa. Conversely, Chinese views for lighter-than-average skin are more positive, as reflected in advertising.|$|E

50|$|Primarily a {{cultural}} phenomenon, {{it pertains to}} the various traditions and peoples of Africa, irrespective of racial origin. As such, <b>Afrophobia</b> is distinct from the historical racial phenomenon Negrophobia, which is a contempt for negro peoples specifically. The opposite of <b>Afrophobia</b> is Afrophilia, which is a love for all things pertaining to Africa.|$|E

50|$|Although melanophobia is {{sometimes}} confused with negrophobia, the former term is more commonly applied to situations involving inanimate {{objects that are}} very dark or black. Negrophobia is also distinct from <b>Afrophobia,</b> which is a perceived fear of the various cultures and peoples of Africa and the African diaspora irrespective of racial origin. Unlike negrophobia, <b>Afrophobia</b> is thus essentially a cultural rather than a racial phenomenon.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{evolved as}} a result of reading a special note of condolences scribed by two women who are in a {{polygamous}} marriage situation from Chikhutu village in Malawi, in 2005. The note was signed by these women as ‘Mama Luhanga and Mama Luhanga,’ the wives of Dada Patson Luhanga, a migrant worker, based in South Africa, with a very strong linguistic, social and cultural background of Tumbuka. The note was meant to ‘comfort and support’ the South Africa based widow, Mme Nanabi Kegakilwe, who lost her husband. Dada Patson Luhanga has been staying on the compound of the late Rre Enoch Kegakilwe for more than twelve years. The existing verbal agreement is that Dada Luhanga will work on the Kegakilwe garden every Saturday of the week, while doing other menial jobs on other days around Midrand in South Africa. As per this agreement, Dada Patson Luhanga was offered accommodation at the Kegakilwe compound pro-bono. Expressly, the note reveals and exposes pains, hurts, and frustrations currently experienced by migrant labourers in South Africa. Recently in South Africa, the crisis of xenophobia, or <b>Afrophobia</b> as some critics prefer to call it, and related spates of violence, add to this challenge. The paper aims to discuss some current South Africa’s migrant labourers’ challenges by making use of theories of folklore and orality. It will use a method of discourse analysis in reading the note and analysing its appropriate hermeneutics of power and identity...|$|E
