40|$|A {{patient with}} post-partum {{thyroiditis}} is described. She was a 22 year old {{with a negative}} family history of autoimmune thyroid disease who was noted {{to have a high}} titre of <b>antithyroid</b> <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibody</b> during pregnancy. She developed mild hyperthyroidism 8 weeks post-partum but at 12 weeks she had a mildly painful enlarged thyroid gland. At 20 weeks post-partum she had severe thyroidal pain with dysphagia. The thyroid was exquisitely tender to palpation. She was treated with L-thyroxine and the pain resolved within 4 weeks. This is the first report documenting pain in the thyroid as a feature of post-partum thyroiditis...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the clinical outcome of Ruanjian Xiaoying Decoction (RJXYD) on chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. Methods: Eighty {{patients with chronic}} lymphocytic thyroiditis were randomly divided into RJXYD-treated group (n＝ 40) and control group (n＝ 40). The patients in the RJXYD-treated group received treatment of RJXYD combined with levothyroxine while {{the others in the}} control group received treatment of levothyroxine and prednisone both for 16 weeks. The serum levels of thyroid hormones and the titres of serum antithyroglobulin antibody (anti-TG Ab) and <b>antithyroid</b> <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibody</b> (anti-TM Ab) were all examined before and after treatment. The total response rates of the two groups were evaluated after treatment of 16 weeks. Results: The total response rate of the RJXYD-treated group was 92. 5 %, while that of the control group was 60. 0 % (P＜ 0. 01). The serum levels of free triiodothyronine (FT 3) and free thyroxine (FT 4) were obviously increased after treatment as compared with those before treatment in the two groups. The titres of serum anti-TG Ab and anti-TM Ab and the serum level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were all obviously decreased after treatment as compared with those before treatment in the two groups. Conclusion: The RJXYD can shrink and soften the enlarged thyroid gland and thyroid nodules, improve the immune function of human body, alleviate the response to thyroid self-antigens and promote the recovery of thyroid function...|$|E
40|$|Background: About 25 - 45 % of {{patients}} of chronic urticaria (CU) {{have been stated}} to have histamine releasing autoantibodies in their blood. The term autoimmune urticaria is increasingly being accepted for this subgroup {{of patients}}. Review of the literature suggests high autologous serum skin test (ASST) positivity and presence of antithyroid microsomal antibodies in patients with autoimmune urticaria. Aims: To study prevalence of ASST positivity and antithyroid microsomal antibodies in chronic "idiopathic" urticaria and to study {{the correlation between the}} two parameters. Methods: All patients of chronic idiopathic urticaria satisfying inclusion/exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study after written informed consent. Patients of CU secondary to infections and infestations, physical urticaria including dermatographism, mastocytosis, urticarial vasculitis and those on treatment with immunosuppressive drugs for urticaria were excluded from the study. In all of these patients, complete blood count; ASST, serum T 3 /T 4 /thyroid stimulating hormone levels, <b>antithyroid</b> <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibody</b> (AMA) levels were done. Statistical analysis was done by Chi-square test, Fisher exact test and Kappa statistics. Results: Study included 24 males and 26 females with mean age of 39. 54 years. Majority of patients belonged to 20 - 40 years of age. Females showed more ASST positivity. A total of 12 out of 50 (24 %) patients showed positive ASST. A total of four out of 12 (33. 33 %) had positive ASST and raised AMA levels. Conclusion: Only 25 % of patients of chronic idiopathic urticaria had positive ASST. ASST and AMA levels were positively correlated in our study. Further studies are required to authenticate this association...|$|E
40|$|Changes in thyroid {{function}} {{may occur}} during treatment with amiodarone. A double blind prospective trial of amiodarone and placebo {{was performed in}} 37 patients in the subacute phase of myocardial infarction. Though none of the patients assigned to receive placebo developed any antibody, six of 13 patients treated with amiodarone developed <b>antithyroid</b> <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibodies.</b> There {{was no difference in}} triiodothyronine and thyroxine concentrations between the two groups, but a significant difference in concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone was noted on day 30 (p less than 0. 05). Six months after the withdrawal of amiodarone autoantibodies could not be detected and concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone were normal. These antibodies have not previously been reported to develop during short term treatment with amiodarone. They could have {{an important role in the}} detection of early thyroid changes in patients given amiodarone...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{describe}} the neutrophil fluorescent patterns produced by antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) with different antigen specificities, and by other auto- and alloantibodies. BACKGROUND: Most sera from patients with active generalised Wegener's granulomatosis result in diffusely granular cytoplasmic neutrophil fluorescence with internuclear accentuation (cANCA) and proteinase 3 (PR 3) specificity. About 80 % of the sera from patients with microscopic polyangiitis result in perinuclear neutrophil fluorescence with nuclear extension (pANCA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) specificity, or a cANCA pattern with PR 3 specificity. However, many different neutrophil fluorescence patterns are noted on testing for ANCA in routine immunodiagnostic laboratories. METHODS: Sera sent for ANCA testing, or containing {{a variety of}} auto- and alloantibodies, were studied. They were examined by indirect immunofluorescence according to {{the recommendations of the}} first international ANCA workshop, and for PR 3 and MPO specificity in commercial and in-house enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). RESULTS: Sera with typical cANCA accounted for only half of all neutrophil cytoplasmic fluorescence. Other sera had "flatter" fluorescence without internuclear accentuation, and the corresponding antigens included MPO and bactericidal/permeability increasing protein (BPI), but were usually unknown. Peripheral nuclear fluorescence without nuclear extension occurred typically when the antigens were BPI, lactoferrin, lysozyme, elastase, or cathepsin G. Most types of ANA were evident on ethanol fixed neutrophil nuclei. AntidsDNA, antiRo, and antilamin antibodies resembled pANCA. Antimicrobial and antiribosomal antibodies produced cytoplasmic fluorescence, and antiGolgi antibodies, a pANCA. Sera from patients with anti-smooth muscle antibodies were associated with cytoplasmic fluorescence. There was no neutrophil fluorescence with anti-skeletal muscle and anti-heart muscle <b>antibodies,</b> anti-liver/kidney <b>microsomal,</b> <b>antithyroid</b> <b>microsomal,</b> or antiadrenal <b>antibodies.</b> Alloantibodies such as antiNB 1 typically resulted in cytoplasmic fluorescence of only a subpopulation of the neutrophils. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to distinguish between different neutrophil fluorescence patterns, and the patterns seen with other auto- and alloantibodies is helpful diagnostically. However, the demonstration of MPO or PR 3 specificity by ELISA will indicate that the neutrophil fluorescence is probably clinically significant, and that the diagnosis is likely to be Wegener's granulomatosis or microscopic polyangiitis...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{wide array}} of {{available}} thyroid diag-nostic tests can help provide accurate diagnoses for most cases of thyroid disease but can be confusing and costly when used inappropriately. Methods: Published articles were reviewed and com-bined with the author’s clinical experience and data collected from patients. Results: The discussions focus on confusing aspects of thyroid diagnostic tests, the use and limitations of the thyrotropin test to screen for thyroid dysfunction, bio-logical factors that complicate the interpretation of this and other thyroid diagnostic tests, and a combined clinical and laboratory approach to (a) thyroid diseases with only one important dimension (“simplex ” condi-tions) and (b) thyroid diseases with several important dimensions (“multiplex ” conditions). Conclusion: The optimal use of thyroid diagnostic tests is patient-specific and depends on the patient’s specific thyroid disease, the stage of disease, and coexisting medical conditions. © 1999 American Association for Clinical Chemistry Several tests are available to evaluate a patient whose thyroid gland is obviously abnormal or whose symptoms or physical signs raise the possibility of thyroid disease. When used and interpreted appropriately, these diagnos-tic tools can identify the abnormality in nearly every case, but many factors contribute to suboptimal usage of thy-roid tests in clinical practice. At a trivial level, test nomenclature can be confusing (Table 1) : some tests have similar names but measure different analytes, and the same test may have different names (free thyroxine in-dex 5 “T 7 ”; <b>antithyroid</b> <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibody</b> 5 anti-thyroid peroxidase). However, most of the difficulty in thyroid diagnosis stems from more substantive causes: complexities in the biology of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology; limitations in sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of the tests; or a misunderstand-ing {{of the meaning of}} results. Clinical findings can and must be integrated with thyroid diagnostic testing to yield accurate and efficient answers to questions pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid patients. Three types of diagnostic tests will be considered in this report: blood tests performed in the clinical chemistry and im-munology laboratories, imaging techniques, and fine-needle biopsies...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{evidence}} of a thyroid disorder was present in 10 out of 40 patients with Addison's disease. Though the remaining 30 patients had no clinical {{evidence of}} thyroid disease, six (out of 15 tested) had thyroid <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibodies</b> and a considerably impaired response to thyrotrophin. These changes are interpreted as very early indications of developing thyroid failure. When circulating <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibodies</b> are found this seems to indicate the presence of established thyroid disease...|$|R

40|$|Serum thyroxine, thyrotrophin, and thyroid <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibody</b> {{levels were}} {{measured}} in 20 patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and hypothyroidism before, during, and after treatment with carbimazole or placebo. Thyroid <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibody</b> levels fell during {{treatment in the}} 10 patients who received carbimazole, while serum thyroxine and thyrotrophin levels did not change. There were no changes in the placebo group. The study proves support for the concept that carbimazole may act directly on autoantibody synthesising lymphocytes localised in the thyroid. Such an effect might be valuable in influencing the autoimmune process in autoimmune thyroid disease...|$|R
40|$|The immunoregulatory {{mechanisms}} {{underlying the}} transient rebound of autoimmune disease {{activity in the}} postpartum period were studied by determining serum immunoglobulins, thyroid <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibodies</b> and some viral (cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr, varicellae-zoster and mumps) and bacterial (Yersinia enterocolitica and Salmonella) antibodies in women with autoimmune thyroiditis and in healthy postpartum women. A characteristic increase between 2 and 5 months postpartum followed by a decrease to 10 - 12 months postpartum was observed not only for thyroid <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibody</b> titres in women with autoimmune thyroiditis but also for serum total IgG and IgG subclass levels (but not IgM, IgA or IgE) in both groups of women. This pattern of transient antibody increase was not detected against viral and bacterial antigens. The characteristic alterations of thyroid <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibody</b> titres in the postpartum period of women with autoimmune thyroiditis thus appear to occur {{as a consequence of}} an activation of immunoglobulin-producing B cell clones. This activation seems restricted to the IgG class and to certain B cell clones...|$|R

40|$|Sera from 20 of 24 {{patients}} with pernicious anaemia reacted by immunoblotting with a 65 - 70 kD protein in canine and rodent gastric mucosal cells enriched for 80 - 90 % parietal cells, and in microsomal preparations derived from these cells. All 20 reactive sera were positive for parietal cell <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibody</b> demonstrated by immunofluorescence. Eighteen parietal cell microsomal antibody-positive sera from {{patients with}} unconfirmed pernicious anaemia also reacted {{with the same}} 65 - 70 kD protein. Serum reactivity with the same 65 - 70 kD protein was not seen with canine and rodent liver cells or with microsomal preparations derived from these cells. Sera from 10 patients with chronic active hepatitis, 10 with scleroderma and 10 with rheumatoid arthritis and 22 healthy persons did not react with the 65 - 70 kD protein. These {{results suggest that the}} 65 - 70 kD protein is probably the parietal cell microsomal autoantigen. A second antigen of 85 - 90 kD mol. wt. present only in canine gastric mucosal preparations also correlates with the presence of parietal cell <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibody.</b> However, the contribution of this second antigen to parietal cell <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibody</b> reactivity remains uncertain...|$|R
40|$|The thyroid microsomal antigen, {{commonly}} {{implicated in}} thyroid autoimmune diseases, {{is not confined}} to cytoplasm, but is also present on the surface of human thyroid cells in primary culture. In this study, a strain of differentiated rat thyroid cells (FRTL 5) grown in continuous culture was used to investigate the relationship between functional status of the thyroid cell and expression of microsomal antigen on its surface. Sera from eight patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, one with idiopathic hypothyroidism, and three with hyperthyroid Graves' disease were selected for the presence of <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibody,</b> but undetectable thyroglobulin antibody. One additional serum sample from a patient with Graves' disease, which was negative for both thyroid antibodies was used. Sera from eight normal subjects were used as controls. Indirect immunofluorescence was applied to FRTL 5 cells that were viable or fixed with acetone in order to expose intracellular antigens. When FRTL 5 cells were cultured in Coon's medium containing TSH (300 microU/ml), positive indirect immunofluorescence surface staining was observed with sera containing <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibody,</b> but not with control sera or with the Graves' serum negative for <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibody.</b> A rough correlation was found between the intensity of the surface fluorescence and <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibody</b> titer. After acetone treatment, microsomal antibody-positive sera produced typical cytoplasmic staining. When FRTL 5 cells were cultured in the absence of TSH, disappearance of the surface fluorescence and reduction of the cytoplasmic microsomal antigen occurred. Readdition of TSH progressively restored both the surface and cytoplasmic microsomal antigen. The present data indicate that the thyroid microsomal antigen is represented on the surface of FRTL 5 cells, and its expression is modulated by TSH...|$|R

40|$|Sixty two thyrotoxic patients, 34 African and 28 Indian, {{were studied}} {{in order to}} assess the {{prevalence}} of thyroid antibodies and TSH binding inhibitory activity (TBI) : 45 had Graves' disease and 17 had toxic nodular goitres. <b>Microsomal</b> and thyroglobulin <b>antibodies</b> were positive more often in Indian than in African patients with Graves' disease (microsomal 52 % vs 37. 4 %, P less than 0. 05; thyroglobulin 38. 1 % vs 4. 2 %, P less than 0. 001). Patients with toxic nodular goitres had a lower prevalence of positive <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibodies</b> (P less than 0. 01), but not of thyroglobulin antibodies (P = 0. 1) when compared with patients with Graves' disease. TBI activity measured by a radioreceptor assay was positive in 43 of the 45 (95 %) patients with Graves' disease and only 1 of the 17 patients (5. 9 %) with toxic nodular goitre.

40|$|We examined, in a 'double blind' study, 60 sera from {{patients}} with pernicious anaemia for immunofluorescence reactivity with the surface membranes of viable parietal cells isolated from dog stomachs. Fifty-three sera (88 %) gave an IgG autoantibody reaction with the surface membranes of parietal cells. Surface staining was also seen with parietal cells from monkey, pig, rat and mouse. The parietal cell surface reactive autoantibody {{was not found}} in any of 14 sera {{from patients}} with chronic active hepatitis, 10 from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and 50 from healthy persons. The surface reactivity autoantibody was present in 13 of 14 sera without parietal cell <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibody,</b> 28 of 31 sera without intrinsic factor antibody and in four of four sera without microsomal and intrinsic factor antibodies.

40|$|AIMS: To {{compare the}} {{prevalence}} of thyroid peroxidase antibodies in 25 children with autoimmune thyroid disorders and in 41 {{children and young adults}} with type 1 diabetes, and to test {{the prevalence of}} thyrotropin receptor antibodies. METHODS: Two commercially available radioimmunoassays for antibodies to thyroid peroxidase, a commercially available agglutination test of particles coated with thyroid microsomal antigens, and a radioimmunoassay for thyrotropin receptor antibodies were used. Patients and controls were studied. RESULTS: One of the radioimmunoassays detected thyroid peroxidase antibodies not only in all children with autoimmune thyroid disorders and children and young adults with type 1 diabetes and thyroid <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibodies,</b> but also in 20 % of healthy control children without <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibodies.</b> With this thyroid peroxidase assay and with microsomal agglutination, 94 % of the children with autoimmune thyroiditis, 71 % of those with Graves' disease, and over 90 % of those with type 1 diabetes and thyroid dysfunction tested positive. In the other radioimmunoassay for thyroid peroxidase antibodies thyroid peroxidase antibody titres in half or more of the children with <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibodies</b> failed to reach the level of positivity given by the producers. Eighty five percent of children with Graves' disease and 71 % of those with autoimmune thyroiditis had thyrotropin receptor antibodies but so did 35 % of children studied for other endocrinological disorders such as delayed growth or puberty.

40|$|Graves' {{disease is}} an organ-specific {{autoimmune}} disease, and intrathyroidal lymphocytes {{seem to be}} the major source of thyroid autoantibodies. Consequently, the intensity of the intrathyroidal lymphocytic infiltration is generally believed to reflect the activity of the autoimmune process. We, therefore, investigated the correlation of microsomal (enzyme immunoassay), thyroglobulin (RIA), and TSH receptor antibodies (RRA) with the degree of intrathyroidal infiltration by immunoglobulin G-producing plasma cells, activated T-cells, antigen-presenting cells, and the total number of lymphocytes. The immunocompetent cells were identified immunohistologically with monoclonal antibodies for immunoglobulins κ and λ, UCHL 1, and the S 100 antibody, respectively, in 26 thyroid glands of patients suffering from Graves' disease. The intensity of lymphocytic infiltration was determined by the point-counting method and by counting all lymphocytes and the labeled lymphocytes in 3 x 51 visual fields or 3 slides/thyroid gland. <b>Microsomal</b> <b>antibodies</b> correlated significantly (P = 0. 001) with the total number of lymphocytes (r = 0. 86), κ (r = 0. 71), λ (r = 0. 71), UCHL 1 (r = 0. 9), and S 100 (r = 0. 9) positive cells. These correlations were also significant for thyroglobulin antibodies. However, TSH receptor antibodies showed no significant correlations with any of the populations of immunocompetent cells. Patients with preoperatively undetectable TSH receptor or <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibodies</b> showed a broad variation of intrathyroidal infiltration by the immunocompetent cells investigated. <b>Microsomal</b> <b>antibody</b> titers, therefore, seem to reflect the intensity of the intrathyroidal autoimmune process in Graves' disease better than TSH receptor antibodies. However, the broad baseline variation in intrathyroidal infiltration observed with nondetectable thyroid antibodies will not always allow determination of the intensity of the intrathyroidal autoimmune process from <b>microsomal</b> or thyroglobulin <b>antibody</b> titers.

40|$|Autoantibodies {{blocking}} the TSH-stimulated cAMP production (TBkAb) were measured in immunoglobulin G (IgG) preparations from 38 patients with primary autoimmune hypothyroidism, using FRTL- 5 cells. TBkAb were detectable in 15 / 23 IgG preparations from patients with untreated idiopathic myxedema, and in 2 / 15 IgGs from patients under L-thyroxine treatment. None of the IgG from 22 normal subjects or from 10 patients with nonautoimmune hypothyroidism following total thyroidectomy caused any {{significant effect on}} the TSH-stimulated cAMP production. No correlation was found between TBkAb and the thyroid <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibody.</b> Antibodies inhibiting the 125 I-TSH binding to TSH receptor were detectable in only 3 / 20 patients; IgGs from these 3 patients were also positive in the TBkAb assay. One IgG with potent TBkAb activity inhibited the TSH-stimulated adenylate cyclase in a competitive manner, while it had no effect on the forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. The inhibiting action of this IgG was almost completely lost after preabsorption with human thyroid membranes. In conclusion, we describe a new practical and sensitive method for the measurement of TBkAb; TBkAb are distinct from the <b>microsomal</b> <b>antibody,</b> and are probably directed to the TSH receptor...|$|R
