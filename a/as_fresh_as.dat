5|$|Moving {{troops to}} the front ahead of the attack was {{nonetheless}} extremely difficult, as {{the only means of}} approaching the front line were narrow boardwalks made of wood planking, which wound between the shell-holes. Slipping off the duckboards could often be deadly with unfortunate soldiers frequently drowning in mud under the weight of their own equipment. On account of the exhausting nature of the trip, the leading assault units entered the support line four days before the battle, to ensure soldiers would be <b>as</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>as</b> possible for the attack.|$|E
25|$|Sculpture {{in stone}} is {{seemingly}} the most permanent way of creating images. Because stone is durable to the weather, {{it is the}} favoured way of adding figurative decoration to the exteriors of church buildings, either with free-standing statues, figures that form a structural part of the building, or panels of pictorial reliefs. Unfortunately with the pollution and acid rain of the 19th and 20th centuries, much architectural sculpture that had remained reasonably intact for centuries has rapidly deteriorated and become unrecognizable in the last 150 years. On the other hand, much sculpture that is located within church buildings is <b>as</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>as</b> {{the day it was}} carved. Because it is often made of the very substance of the building which houses it, narrative stone sculpture is often found internally to be decorating features such as capitals, or as figures located within the apertures of stone screens.|$|E

500|$|The {{body was}} {{supposed}} to be the victim of an aeroplane crash, and it was decided that to try and simulate the accident at sea using flares and other devices could be too risky and open to discovery. After seaplanes and surface ships were dismissed as being problematic, a submarine was chosen as the method of delivering the corpse to the region. To transport the body by submarine, it needed to be contained within the body of the boat, as any externally mounted container would have to be built with a skin so thick it would alter the level of the waterline. The canister needed to remain airtight and keep the corpse <b>as</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>as</b> possible through its journey. Spilsbury provided the medical requirements and Cholmondeley contacted Charles Fraser-Smith of the Ministry of Supply to produce the container, which was labelled [...] "Handle with care: optical instruments".|$|E

[...] Melody Maker was also enthusiastic about the album, commenting, [...] "if you ignore this album you are not only foolish – but deaf!". [...] Record Mirror awarded the album four stars out of five and Allen Evans of the NME also praised the LP: [...] "This is an exciting album, at times brash and noisy ('So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star', 'Have You Seen Her Face'), spooky (the science-fiction outer-space sounds on 'C.T.A.-102'), folksy ('Everybody's Been Burned'), weird (the irritating, monotonous backing to 'Mind Gardens'), and pleasant (the soft swinging of 'The Girl with No Name').

500|$|... "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe" [...] {{initially}} {{earned a}} Nielsen rating of 1.3, translating to 980,000 viewers, {{which is considered}} high for a cable program in the United States. In April 2007, The New Zealand Herald called the first episode [...] "a huge success"; however, reviews {{at the time of}} the episode's broadcast were generally negative, most focusing on the low, obscene comedy. Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly thought poorly of the writing and characters, stating that [...] "If only the kids' jokes were <b>as</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>as</b> their mouths" [...] and [...] "It might help if the South Park kids had personalities, but they're as one-dimensional as the show's cut-and-paste animation". Tim Goodman of The San Francisco Examiner acknowledged that many viewers will find South Park [...] "vile, rude, sick, potentially dangerous, childish and mean-spirited". He argued that viewers [...] "have to come into 'South Park' with a bent for irony, sarcasm, anger and an understanding that cardboard cut-out animation of foul-mouthed third-graders is a tragically underused comic premise." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", {{the first}} episode of the series, {{received}} generally negative reviews after airing. Brent Bozell, founder and then-president of the Parents Television Council, gave an unfavorable review to the episode, stating that the show [...] "is so offensive that it shouldn't have been made. It doesn't just push the envelope; it knocks it off the table." [...] Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly thought poorly of the writing and characters, lampooning that [...] "if only the kids' jokes were <b>as</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>as</b> their mouths" [...] and that [...] "it might help if the South Park kids had personalities, but they're as one-dimensional as the show's cut-and-paste animation." [...] Calling the series [...] "sophomoric, gross, and unfunny," [...] Hal Boedeker of the Orlando Sentinel reckoned that the episode made [...] "such a bad impression that it's hard {{to get on the}} show's strange wavelength." [...] Tom Shales of The Washington Post considered that [...] "most of the alleged humor on the premiere is self-conscious and self-congratulatory in its vulgarity: flatulence jokes, repeated use of the word 'dildo' (in the literal as well as pejorative sense), and a general air of malicious unpleasantness." ...|$|E
500|$|The grain used in Grodziskie is malted wheat. [...] During the malting process, {{the wheat}} is dried in kilns that are heated by oak-burning {{furnaces}}. [...] Instead {{of using the}} furnaces to heat air which is then used to dry the wheat, the hot smoke from the kilns is forced directly through the grain bed. [...] The smoke dries the grain, and imparts a light color and an intense, pleasant, smoky flavor. [...] This [...] process {{would not be possible}} in the type of kilns that were more common in the past, that burned coal or coke as fuel because the soot in the smoke would cause the grain to become discolored and contribute undesirable harsh flavors. [...] The exact degree of smokiness that resulted from the oak kilning in historical times is not known. [...] The smoke from the malting process also adds chemical components to the finished product that help preserve it, giving it a long shelf life despite its low alcohol content. [...] One story is told of a box of Grodziskie being found in the 1950s, buried in the sands of North Africa, that was left behind by German soldiers during World War II. [...] The beer was opened and found to be <b>as</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>as</b> the day it was made. [...] In addition to wheat, there were periods when the beer also included malted barley in various proportions, but for most of its history, it was made entirely from wheat.|$|E

500|$|Conversely, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it three-and-a-half stars out of {{four and}} called it [...] "an {{astonishing}} achievement in imaginative filmmaking" [...] and said [...] "Lucas tells a good story." [...] Ebert also wrote that [...] "If some of the characters are less than compelling, perhaps that's inevitable" [...] {{because it is the}} opening film in the new trilogy. He concluded his review by saying that rather than Star Trek films, filmmakers could [...] "ive me transparent underwater cities and vast hollow senatorial spheres any day." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B" [...] grade and complimented Liam Neeson's performance and the action scenes. In an Entertainment Weekly review for the DVD release, Marc Bernardin gave the film a [...] "C-", calling it [...] "haplessly plotted, horribly written, and juvenile". ReelViews' James Berardinelli wrote:Looking at the big picture, in spite of all its flaws, The Phantom Menace is still among the best [...] "bang for a buck" [...] fun that can be had in a movie theater. It isn't <b>as</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>as</b> the original Star Wars nor does it have the thematic richness and narrative complexity of The Empire Strikes Back, but it is a distinct improvement over Return of the Jedi. In fact, after Return of the Jedi, I didn't have a burning desire to return to this galaxy 'far, far away', but, with The Phantom Menace, Lucas has revived my interest. Now, it's with genuine regret that I realize the next segment of the series is three long years away.|$|E
500|$|In 1882, Edmund Gosse {{analyzed}} {{the reception of}} Gray's poem: [...] "It is curious to reflect upon the modest and careless mode in which that poem was first circulated which was destined to enjoy and to retain a higher reputation in literature than any other English poem perhaps than any other poem of the world written between Milton and Wordsworth." [...] He continued by stressing the poem's wide acceptance: [...] "The fame of the Elegy has spread to all countries and has exercised an influence on all the poetry of Europe, from Denmark to Italy, from France to Russia. With the exception of certain works of Byron and Shakespeare, no English poem has been so widely admired and imitated abroad and {{after more than a}} century of existence we find it <b>as</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>as</b> ever, when its copies, even the most popular of all those of Lamartine, are faded and tarnished." [...] He concluded with a reinforcing claim on the poem's place in English poetry: [...] "It possesses the charm of incomparable felicity, of a melody that is not too subtle to charm every ear, of a moral persuasiveness that appeals to every generation, and of metrical skill that in each line proclaims the master. The Elegy may almost be looked upon as the typical piece of English verse, our poem of poems; not that it is the most brilliant or original or profound lyric in our language, but because it combines in more balanced perfection than any other all the qualities that go to the production of a fine poetical effect." ...|$|E

2500|$|When testing urine for ketones, {{the sample}} {{needs to be}} <b>as</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>as</b> possible.

Reading the colors at those time intervals is important because the colors will continue to darken and a later reading will be an incorrect result.
