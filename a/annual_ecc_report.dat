In Europe, SE 43 working group in CEPT is leading the discussion on the technical requirements for exploiting TV white spaces through the recent <b>ECC</b> <b>report</b> 159. Its analytical approach for determining the maximum permissible power for the secondary user, however, overestimates the power level, and leads to significant violation of the interference limit for TV reception.

The geolocation database is populated according to Electronic Communications Committee (<b>ECC)</b> <b>report</b> 186 methodology. The {{application programming interface}} (API) between the sensor network and the geolocation database implements an effective and secure connection to successfully gather sensing data and sends it to the geolocation database for post-processing. On the other hand, the testbed allows authorized TV white space devices {{to gain access to}} the services of the geolocation database, according to a draft implementation of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Protocol to Access White Space (PAWS) Two experimental methodologies are available with the testbed: one focused on coexistence studies with commercial wireless microphones, when the testbed is used for sensing only, and another for demonstration purposes, when the testbed is also used to emulate wireless microphone signals. Overall, this hybrid approach is a promising solution for the effective use of TV white spaces and for the coexistence with digital TV broadcast signals, or dynamic incumbent systems, such as unregistered wireless microphones.|$|R
40|$|In the European {{regulatory}} domain the CEPT ECC {{working group}} TG 3 on Ultra Wideband (UWB) {{has developed a}} broad framework for the regulation of the deployment of UWB devices in Europe. In {{the first draft of}} the regulation the deployment of UWB will be strictly restricted to indoor usage, prohibiting usage in cars, trains and planes in order to guarantee maximum interference mitigation towards incumbent services. Thus planned deployment of UWB in cars for different kind of application like sensor or car multimedia communications application would be prohibited under the existing regulation. The attenuation measurements presented in this paper should pave the way towards a less restrictive definition of the indoor usage model including the in-car usage. The measurements have been carried out at the premises of the Joint Research Center (JRC) in Ispra, Italy in the European Microwave Signature Laboratory (EMSL). As a main result of the measurements {{it can be seen that}} the average worst case attenuation in the frequency range of interest of the evaluated cars is in the range of the assumed indoor to outdoor attenuation of 10 dB to 12 dB assumed in the CEPT <b>ECC</b> <b>Report</b> 64.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{initiate}} an emergency communication to summon help when needed is regarded by the European Union {{as a right}} of all citizens and when emergency assistance is needed {{it is essential that}} emergency services organisations are able to determine the location of the caller {{with a high degree of}} confidence in the shortest possible period of time. High quality accurate and reliable caller location information is vital for enabling the emergency services organisations to provide a timely response to an emergency incident. In order to achieve this objective in Europe, Article 26 (5) 1 of the Universal Service Directive requires Member States to ensure that “undertakings concerned make caller location information available free of charge to the authority handling emergency calls as soon as the call reaches that authority”.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this <b>ECC</b> <b>Report</b> is to provide {{up-to-date}} guidelines for efficient, technology independent deployment of 3. 5 GHz (or 3. 7 GHz) Point-to-Multipoint (PMP) Fixed Wireless Systems (FWS), traditionally referred to as Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) systems. The Report recognises that the current technology for FWA in bands around 3. 5 GHz is in continuous extensive evolution since first ERC Recommendations 14 - 03 and 12 - 08 were developed. A detailed study on the coexistence of various technologies was {{needed in order to}} provide guidance to Administrations that wish to adopt an efficient and technology neutral approach to the deployment rules in these bands. It is also noted that ETSI ENs in these bands are not presently designed for a technology neutral deployment (this is done only in the 40 GHz Multimedia Wireless Systems in EN 301 997) therefore do not contain system controlling parameters, in terms of EIRP, useful for the desired “technology neutral ” and “uncoordinated ” deployment. Not having any ECC harmonised guidance for such deployment, the ENs are still bound to a cell-by-cell “co-ordinated deployment ” concept actually not used in most of the licensing regimes. This report might generate future feedback actions in revising also ETSI ENs accordingly. Aspects that relate to sharing issues with Point-to-Point FS, FSS, radiolocation (in adjacent band) and ENG/OB are not considered in this Report.

40|$|In 2006 the ECC {{examined}} {{the impact of}} pulsed Low-Duty Cycle (LDC) UWB signals {{on the quality of}} various services (FTP, VoIP, video streaming) provided via a fixed WiMAX (IEEE 802. 16 d) link, and published its findings in <b>ECC</b> <b>Report</b> 94 [1]. The resulting spectrum regulation and standardization stipulate a maximum UWB activity (Ton) of 50 ms per second, with a maximum permissible pulse width of 5 ms. Report 94 showed that for activity factors of 5 % there was no measurable impact on any of the victim services if a minimum distance of 4 meters (LOS) between the UWB interferer and the WiMAX terminal was maintained. As fixed WiMAX terminals are typically mounted outdoors in elevated positions the isolation between a WiMAX terminal and LDC UWB devices will in most cases be sufficiently high to avoid interference. Mobile WiMAX (IEEE 802. 16 e- 2005) terminals, however, may be operating indoors, in close vicinity to a UWB device. On the other hand, mobile WiMAX was designed to be more robust against fading and interference than fixed WiMAX. The objective of the measurement campaign described in this document was to determine the impact of UWB LDC signals on different types of services provided by a mobile WiMAX (IEEE 802. 16 e- 2005, further on referred to as “WiMAX”) victim system, and in particular to examine LDC pulses with a width of more than 5 ms, whilst maintaining an overall activity limit of 5 %, equalling 50 ms per second.

40|$|International audienceIndoor {{positioning}} {{appears to}} be a real challenging topic and many techniques have been proposed these last ten years, ranging from High-Sensitivity GNSS to sensor networks, through Assisted-GNSS or WLAN based approaches. No ultimate solution seems yet to provide the answer to the problem, probably crucial to Location Based Services, of continuity of the availability of the positioning from outdoors (where GNSS are such good candidates) to indoors. Current works are mainly oriented towards hybridisation techniques. The repeater approach is based on the use of GNSS so-called repeaters in order to provide GNSS availability indoors through the way of an amplification of the signals received by an outdoor antenna (typically located on the roof). The complete system, already presented in previous conferences, uses four repeaters in order to provide a full 3 D 1 to 2 meter accuracy positioning, indoors. The measurements, performed at the receiver end, are the pseudo-ranges at the instant of transition from one repeater to the next, the transmission being achieved through a sequential scheme (only one repeater transmitting at any given time). Since regulations tend to be provided (<b>ECC</b> <b>reports</b> on maximum transmitted power allowed) for both repeaters and pseudolites, we carried out indoor propagation simulations, for real environments, in order to define realistic deployments of both systems. Different buildings have been considered and modelled. Coverage and positioning accuracy results are presented for various hypotheses: full 3 D (3 D positioning all over the building), 2. 5 D (2 D positioning all over the building and 3 D provided only where floor level changes are possible, i. e. near the stairs and near the lifts) and only 2 D (assuming the floor level is available through another mean).

40|$|AbstractObjectivesIssues such as {{specimen}} adequacy and diagnostic yield {{have rarely}} {{been studied in}} rural regions. This study investigated specimen adequacy and the diagnostic yield of cervical smears from outreach screening services in remote regions in eastern Taiwan. Materials and methodsThere were 5670 smears from outreach screening services; 649 smears were taken in mobile screening van units or in temporary walk-in clinics. The quality, compromising factors, and positive rates of smears from mobile screening van units and temporary walk-in clinics were compared with those obtained in physician offices. ResultsThe quality of smears from physician offices {{was better than the}} quality from mobile van screening units and temporary walk-in clinics; the satisfactory rates were 72 %, 54 %, and 53 %, respectively (χ 2  =  109. 9910, p <  0. 0001; df =  4). The most important limiting factor, absence of endocervical component (<b>ECC),</b> was <b>reported</b> in 56 %, 57 %, and 73 % of suboptimal smears at physician offices, mobile van screening units, and temporary walk-in clinics, respectively (χ 2  =  25. 2780, p <  0. 001; df =  2). Poor fixation compromised 18 %, 18 %, and 14 % of smears taken at physician offices, mobile van screening units, and temporary walk-in clinics, respectively. For smears taken in physician offices, the odds ratio for positivity of suboptimal smears with ECC was nine times the odds ratio of suboptimal smears with no ECC. ConclusionThe issue of quality of specimens from outreach services in rural areas needs to be emphasized to improve the sensitivity of the test. In future studies, the difficulties that health workers encounter when taking smears in outreach services and the underlying sociocultural and demographic barriers need to be elucidated...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasound (US) {{has shown}} to be of great value in {{diagnostics}} and treatment of injuries and chronic pain disorders of the musculoskeletal system. Today, it {{is considered to be}} a suitable method when investigating superficially located tendons. Another exciting field of application is the use of US for guidance of different invasive treatments. Traditionally, most diagnostic imaging have been performed at the radiologic departments but the interest for the technique at different care units, including orthopaedic out-patient clinics, has increased. The whole idea and design of this thesis is based on the use of US in an out-patient orthopaedic/sports medicine clinic, in contrary to the traditional use of US. The general purpose of this thesis was to highlight and evaluate the use and accuracy of US - for diagnostics, treatment guidance, and evaluation of treatment results regarding some of the most common musculoskeletal overuse injuries and pain disorders. All patients participating in the studies of this thesis were referred to the Capio Artro Clinic, Stockholm, Sweden with chronic disabling pain in either the Achilles tendon (AT), the patellar tendon (PT) or in the rotator cuff of the shoulder. In study I the main purpose was to assess the inter- and intra-observer reliability in measures of tendon thickness and in the use of a 4 -graded evaluation score for US findings. Twenty-eight consecutive patients suffering from chronic painful Achilles- or patellar tendinosis were included. The reliability for measures of distance was found to be high. Inter-observer reliability concerning evaluation of neovascularization was moderate to strong, and poor to moderate concerning structural changes. Intra-observer reliability was moderate to strong for evaluations of both tendon structure and neovascularization. The aim of study II was to evaluate and compare the clinical results and the US and colour Doppler (CD) findings after treatment of patellar tendinopathy/ jumper’s knee, using US/CD guided sclerosing injections or US/CD guided arthroscopic shaving, respectively. Forty-three patients with a total of 57 treated tendons were included in this medium-term follow-up study. In the group treated with US/CD guided arthroscopic shaving the mean thickness of the proximal PT had decreased significantly from baseline to endpoint. Tendon improved significantly, and there was significantly less neovascularization at the short term follow-up compared to baseline, in both treatment groups. In study III we evaluated the accuracy of office-based US imaging of rotator cuff tears, performed by a biomedical technician, using arthroscopic surgery as reference method. A secondary aim was to evaluate the differences in the diagnostic value between US imaging in connection to the clinical examination, and the regular concept with MRI performed several weeks prior to the clinical examination. Eighty-two patients underwent all three examination modalities; MRI, US and arthroscopy. Regarding full-thickness tears, including all tendons of the cuff, US showed a sensitivity of 85 %, a specificity of 91 % and an accuracy of 90 %. Based on evaluations of the supraspinatus tendon alone US showed a sensitivity of 100 %, a specificity of 89 % and an accuracy of 94 %. The aim of study IV was to present the short term interim results (6 months) of a new ultrasound and colour Doppler-guided mini-invasive surgical treatment method on chronic painful midportion Achilles tendinopathy, in comparison with the results of eccentric calf muscle training (ECC) and sclerosing (Polidocanol) injections. Thirty-four patients with chronic painful AT (n= 42 tendons) were enrolled in this randomized controlled study. All treatment methods led to clinical improvements. Patients treated with <b>ECC</b> <b>reported</b> less pain and were more satisfied with the treatment result at the follow-up 6 months after the start of the treatment when compared to the other two treatment methods. Conclusions: The modified, 4 -graded, Öhberg score was found to be a useful and reliable instrument when evaluating status and progress of Achilles and patellar tendon tendinosis. Using the Öhberg score we could detect a remodelling and a sonographically more normal PT after successful treatment of jumper’s knee with US/CD guided arthroscopic shaving compared to US/CD guided sclerosing injections. Both treatment methods rendered good and equal clinical results at medium 4 years after treatment. However, US/CD guided arthroscopic shaving showed a significantly faster return to sport activity, and patient satisfaction could be noticed at an earlier point. Office-based US imaging of the shoulder, performed by a trained biomedical technician, showed a sufficient accuracy in detecting significant rotator cuff tears. When identifying those injuries the diagnostic value of US imaging performed in connection to the clinical examination was higher than the MRI performed several weeks prior to the examination. The US/CD guided mini-invasive surgical treatment, for midportion Achilles tendinosis showed a faster clinical improvement than sclerosing injections. In the short-term perspective the ECC seems to lead to the best result. However, the US/CD guided surgical treatment might be a more effective treatment for patients with difficulties in tolerating the uncompromising eccentric training program...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Safe and {{effective}} contraceptive use can improve women's reproductive health. Although the contraceptive prevalence rate in South Africa {{is comparable to}} rates globally, the distribution is inequitable and marginalises poor and rural women. This study aimed at identifying factors associated with contraceptive uses {{in a rural area}} in South Africa. METHO D: Cross-sectional survey data based on face-to-face interviews with female participants between 18 to 44 years were collected for a primary FAS prevention study in rural and urban South Africa. This study examined data for rural women only. The outcome variable was Effective Contraceptive use (ECC) which included use of oral contraceptives, condoms or injectables, or having been sterilised. Independent variables included socio-demographic factors, substance use, psychosocial factors, community factors, childbearing characteristics and partner characteristics RESULTS: Women were more likely to use <b>ECC</b> if they <b>reported</b> high self-esteem (compared to low or moderate self-esteem PRR= 1. 53; 95 % CI: 0. 99 - 2. 39); if they strongly or moderately agreed that their culture entitled men to children compared to those who disagreed (PRR= 1. 55; 95 % CI: 0. 95 - 2. 52); and if they had one child or more compared to no children (PRR= 2. 51; 95 % CI: 1. 64 - 3. 84). CONCLUSION: To promote contraceptive use in in similar rural populations, family planning programmes could focus on increasing men's approval of contraception, improving partner communication around family planning and bolstering women's confidence in their reproductive decision-making, particularly their self-esteem. There should be greater focus on nulliparous women and women between 18 and 24 years old who have th e lowest Contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{research}} carried {{out into the}} use of Artificial Intelligence techniques for Power System Analysis. A number of aspects of Power System analysis and its management are investigated {{and the application of}} Artificial Intelligence techniques is researched. The use of software tools for checking the application of power system protection systems particularly for complex circuit arrangements was investigated. It is shown that the software provides a more accurate and efficient way of carrying out these investigations. The National Grid Company's (plc, UK) use of software tools for checking the application of protection systems is described, particularly for complex circuit arrangements such as multi-terminal circuits and composite overhead line and cable circuits. Also described, is how investigations have been made into an actual system fault that resulted in a failure of protection to operate. Techniques using digital fault records to replay a fault into a static model of protection are used in the example. The need for dynamic modelling of protection is also discussed. Work done on automating the analysis of digital fault records using computational techniques is described. An explanation is given on how a rule-based system has been developed to classify fault types and analyse the response of protection during a power system fault or disturbance in order to determine correct or incorrect operation. The development of expert systems for on-line application in Energy Control Centres (<b>ECC),</b> is <b>reported.</b> The development of expert systems is a continuous process as new knowledge is gained in the field of artificial intelligence and new expert system development tools are built. Efforts are being made for on-line application of expert systems in ECC as preventive control under normal/alert conditions and as a corrective control during a disturbance. This will enable a more secure power system operation. Considerable scope exists in the development of expert systems and their application to power system operation and control. An overview of the many different types of Neural Network has been carried out explaining terminology and methodology along with a number of techniques used for their implementation. Although the mathematical concepts are not new, many of them were recorded more than fifty years ago, the introduction of fast computers has enabled many of these concepts to be used for today's complex problems. The use of Genetic Algorithm based Artificial Neural Networks is demonstrated for Electrical Load Forecasting and the use of Self Organising Maps is explored for classifying Power System digital fault records. The background of the optimisation process carried out in this thesis is given and an introduction to the method applied, in particular Evolutionary Programming and Genetic Algorithms. Possible solutions to optimisation problems were introduced to be either local or global minimum solutions with the latter being the desirable result. The evolutionary computation that has potential to produce a global solution to a problem due to the searching mechanisms that are inherent to the procedures is discussed. Various mechanisms may be introduced to the genetic algorithm routine which may eliminate the problems of premature convergence, thus enhancing the methods' chances of producing the best solution. The other, more traditional methods of optimisation described include Lagrange multipliers, Dynamic Programming, Local Search and Simulated annealing. Only the Dynamic Programming method guarantees a global optimum solution to an optimisation problem, however for complex problems, the method could take a vast amount of time to locate a solution due to the potential for combinatorial explosion since every possible solution is considered. The Lagrange multiplier method and the local search method are useful for quick location of a global minimum and are therefore useful when the topography of the optimisation problem is uni-modal. However in a complex multi-modal problem, a global solution is less likely. The simulated annealing method has been more popular for solving complex multi-modal problems since it includes techniques for the search to avoid being trapped in local minimum solutions. Artificial Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm have been used to design a neural network for short-term load forecasting. The forecasting model has been used to produce a forecast of the load in the 24 hours of the forecast day concerned, using data provided by an Italian power company. The results obtained are promising. In this particular case, the comparison between the results from the Genetic Algorithm - Artificial Neural Network and Back Propagation - Neural Network shows that the Genetic Algorithm - Artificial Neural Network does not provide a faster solution than the Back Propagation - Neural Network. The application of Evolutionary Programming to fault section estimation is investigated and a comparison made with a Genetic Algorithm approach. To enhance service reliability and to reduce power outage, rapid restoration of power system is required. As a first step of restoration, the fault section should be accurately estimated quickly. The Fault Section Estimation (FSE) identifies fault components in a power system by using information on the operation of protection relays and circuit breakers. However this task is difficult especially for cases where the relay or circuit breaker fails to operate and for multiple faults. An Evolutionary Programming (EP) approach has been developed for solving the FSE problem including malfunctions of protection relays and/or circuit breakers and multiple fault cases. A comparison is made with the Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach at the same time. Two different population sizes are tested for each case. In general, EP showed faster computational speed than GA with an average factor of 13 times more. The final results were almost the same. The convergence speed (the required number of generations to get an optimum result) is a very important factor in real time applications. Test results show that EP is better than GA. However, as both EP and GA are evolutionary algorithms, their efficiencies are largely dependent on the complexity of the problem that might differ from case to case. The use of Artificial Neural Networks to classify digital fault records is investigated showing theat Self Organising Maps could be useful for classifying records if integrated into other systems. Digital fault records are a very useful source of information to the protection engineer to assist with the investigation of a suspected unwanted operation or failure to operate of a protection scheme. After a widespread power system disturbance, due to a storm for example, a large number of fault records can be produced. A method of automatically classifying fault records would be very helpful in reducing {{the amount of time spent}} in manual analysis, thus assisting the engineer to focus on records that need in depth analysis. Fault classification using rule base methods have already been developed. The completed work is preliminary in nature and an overview of an extension to this work, involving the extraction of frequency components from the digital fault record data and using these as input to a SOM network, is described...|$|R
