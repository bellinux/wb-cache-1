5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} containing hydrogen ions (H+) {{are classified}} as acids, and those containing electropositive cations and basic anions ions hydroxide (OH−) or oxide (O2−) {{are classified as}} bases. Other ionic compounds are known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions. If the compound {{is the result of}} <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> between a strong acid and a weak base, the result is an acidic salt. If it is the result of <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> between a strong base and a weak acid, the result is a basic salt. If it is the result of <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> between a strong acid and a strong base, the result is a neutral salt. Weak acids reacted with weak bases can produce ionic compounds with both the conjugate base ion and conjugate acid ion, such as ammonium acetate.|$|E
5|$|Like all catalysts, enzymes {{increase}} the reaction rate by lowering its activation energy. Some enzymes {{can make their}} conversion of substrate to product occur many millions of times faster. An extreme example is orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase, which allows <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds. Chemically, enzymes are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical reactions, nor do they alter the equilibrium of <b>a</b> <b>reaction.</b> Enzymes differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and activators are molecules that increase activity. Many therapeutic drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. An enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its optimal temperature and pH.|$|E

5|$|Polymorphous light {{eruption}} (PMLE) is {{the easiest}} disease to mistake for solar urticaria because {{the locations of the}} lesions are similar (the V of the neck and the arms). However, patients with SU are more likely to develop lesions on the face. Also, <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> with PMLE will take a greater amount of time to appear than with solar urticaria. Lupus erythematosus has been mistaken for SU; however, lesions from lupus erythematosus will take a longer amount of time to go away. Furthermore, when being tested for the two diseases, patients with SU have <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> immediately while patients with lupus erythematosus will have a delayed reaction. Patients who have experienced solar urticarial symptoms from a young age could mistakenly be thought to have erythropoietic protoporphyria. However, the main symptom for this disease is pain and patients with have been found to have abnormal levels of protoporphyrin in their blood while these levels are normal in SU patients. Finally, cholinergic urticaria, or urticaria induced by heat, can occasionally appear to be solar urticaria because the heat from the sun will cause a person with the disease to have <b>a</b> <b>reaction.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: A case {{in which}} a 45 -year-old female patient with {{peritonitis}} experienced immediate-type hypersensitivity on two occasions after administration of preparations containing six different medications was referred to us for closer inspection. Methods/Results: Skin tests performed on the six medications revealed <b>a</b> positive <b>reaction</b> to the vitamin B 6 preparation Biosechs (Wakamoto Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan). Further investigation showed that the principal ingredient, pyridoxal 5 '-phosphate (PLP), produced <b>a</b> positive <b>reaction,</b> whereas the injection solvent with the principal ingredient removed produced <b>a</b> negative <b>reaction.</b> When compounds similar to PLP were tested, pyridoxine (PN), pyridoxamine and pyridoxal produced <b>a</b> negative <b>reaction,</b> whereas pyridoxine 5 '-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5 '-phosphate (PMP) produced <b>a</b> positive <b>reaction.</b> Adenosine 2 '-phosphate and adenosine 5 '-diphosphate were also tested and these produced <b>a</b> negative <b>reaction.</b> When <b>a</b> histamine-release test was performed, PLP and PMP produced <b>a</b> positive <b>reaction,</b> whereas PN produced <b>a</b> negative <b>reaction.</b> When all tests were performed on three control subjects, the results were all negative. Conclusions: In this very rare case, phosphate radical conjugates with a pyridine nucleus became haptenic-epitope and <b>an</b> immediate-type <b>reaction</b> occurred. In past cases involving hypersensitivity to vitamin B 6, two cases involved <b>a</b> photoallergic <b>reaction</b> caused by PN and one case involved an immediate-type hypersensitivity caused by PLP In the past cases, closely related substances had not been tested and an epitope was not identified...|$|R

5|$|According to the synoptics, {{the arrest}} of Jesus was <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> to the {{cleansing}} of the temple, while according to John it was triggered by the raising of Lazarus.

Without generalizability and the possibility of third-person examination, the behaviorists argued, psychology cannot be scientific.
