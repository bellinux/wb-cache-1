40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. This study {{deals with}} Customer Relationship Management (CRM) of a {{department}} of an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of trackless mining equipment. The study was done from the service deliverer's perspective. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine an effective Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) in order to assist the OEM to deliver superior satisfaction to its customers in the <b>Aftermarket</b> <b>service</b> delivery environment. It also aims to determine what the OEM needs to do to meet the customers' demands in order to develop a meaningful relationship for both the customer and the service provider. The gap in the perceptions of the customers and the perceptions of the managers of the OEM's <b>Aftermarket</b> <b>service</b> contracts were identified, to reveal the Key Performance Areas (KPAs) for improvement. In order to reveal these KPAs, a literature study was conducted, as a first part of the study. The literature study also helped to create a better understanding of CRM, superior customer value and satisfaction in the service environment. The second part of the study consisted of an empirical investigation. Customers and managers of the OEM's <b>Aftermarket</b> <b>service</b> contracts had to complete questionnaires. Completed questionnaires were received from the total population of the customers and managers. The analysis of the database that was compiled from the questionnaire's responses was done by using Microsoft's ® Office 2007 Suite, supported by Levine, Stephan, Krehbiel and Berenson's textbook Statistics for Managers Using Microsoft ® Excel. The analysis identified a significant difference in seven out of the seventy-eight aspects, in the responses from the customers' perceptions versus the perceptions of the OEM's managers. The analysis also provided a base for the CSI. The combination of these aspects and the CSI exposed five KPAs which need to be improved by the service provider to meet the customers' demands. Improvement of the exposed five KPAs will assist to develop a meaningful relationship for both the customer and the service provider. This study recommended that the OEM develops an action plan based on the climate survey that was done in 2008 in the company and that the OEM improves the communication to the customers related to the OEM remuneration strategy. Furthermore, it was recommended that the importance of the information provided is emphasised by changing the reporting lines, that the defects with regard to the service exchange components' repairs are reported according to the ISO 9001 system. A further recommendation is that the benefits to the customer to promote the OEM's service contracts should be communicated to the customer. Lastly, training to the OEM's managers to manage a service level agreement (SLA) successfully was recommended. Master...|$|E

40|$|Competitive {{markets in}} which buyers face {{a cost of}} {{switching}} suppliers can result in an inefficient pricing pattern: sellers initially seek to gain market share with below-cost prices, then later exploit past customers with above-cost prices. This article shows that, rather than simply offer cash discounts initially, sellers can bundle a tied good that is worth more to high-demand buyers. This bundling strategy can efficiently screen out socially undesirable sales to low-demand buyers that a straight cash discount would invite. This theory can explain warranties, which {{are a kind of}} tying contract in which <b>aftermarket</b> <b>service</b> is bundled with a durable good. The theory also has application in imperfectly competitive markets, in which sellers for reasons of price discrimination prefer a pricing pattern with high aftermarket prices and low durable-good prices. Finally, the theory has implications for antitrust law in the Kodak setting and antitrust cases involving warranties specifically. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago.

40|$|In many recent {{antitrust}} cases, {{manufacturers of}} complex high- technology equipment {{have been accused}} of exercising market power in the sale of proprietary service or parts necessary to maintain the machines they produce. The manufacturer generally concedes that it has market power in selling the <b>aftermarket</b> <b>service</b> or parts, but argues that it would not exercise such power because high aftermarket prices would cause consumers to select a different brand in the competitive market for the original equipment. We study the incentive to exercise market power in aftermarkets when the original equipment market is perfectly competitive, a differentiated duopoly, or monopolized. In all cases, we show that the price in the aftermarket will exceed marginal cost. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that aftermarket prices may actually be higher when the equipment market is more competitive. Nonetheless, we suggest that in a richer model [...] in which equipment sellers might want to price discriminate, create barriers to entry, or influence the pace at which users upgrade to newer models [...] firms in less competitive equipment markets are likely to have a greater incentive to maintain a monopoly position in the sale of their aftermarket products. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to discuss employment in the United States (US) service sector. The main concern is not pinpointing numerical estimates, but instead identifying trends which lead to job growth or job loss. Like manufacturing jobs that have been lost to offshore locations or productivity gains, so too are service jobs at risk. Offshoring - the outsourcing of business functions overseas - and automation have the same effect of displacing workers. What keeps a service job in the US and what makes it ideal to ship overseas or replace with a computer? Consumers have several choices between different product and service offerings. And, different products need varied levels of <b>aftermarket</b> <b>service.</b> What makes customers go out and spend money rather than completing tasks themselves? This thesis attacks these questions by outlining characteristics of products, services, and consumers which could help label jobs as "safe" or "at-risk. " First is a discussion of these characteristics. Then, the range of product and service alternatives that consumers have to choose from is presented and applied to examples. (cont.) Overall, jobs which may be at-risk are those occupations that can be offshored, automated, or easily performed by consumers themselves. On the other hand, jobs that may prove safer are those with high barriers to self-service, those that offer a customized service or experience, and those that require physical contact to be performed. by Eric D.

40|$|Many {{original}} equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are enhancing their product offering with (aftermarket) services {{to increase the}} value proposition to customers by delivering functionality rather than a physical product. Manufacturers that expand into services encounter many challenges and the promised profitability of services does not always materialize. Turning services into a profitable growth engine requires suitable service operations. However, many uncertainties remain about how to achieve excellence in <b>aftermarket</b> <b>service</b> operations. In this dissertation we {{shed some light on}} how aftermarket services can be delivered profitably. After providing an overview of operational challenges and best practices in the aftermaker industry, we focus on specific operational challenges at the case study company. We demonstrate how reliability analysis can be used to obtain insights about the failure behavior of machines. Next, the problem of cross training technicians is studied. The case study company also sells remanufacturing services. In this context we optimize the logistic network and contract design required to market and execute this service. In the last research project, we focus on multi-dimensional perfomance evalution of service centers. To this end we formulate an adapted data envelopement model which is capable of simultaneously evaluating the operational efficiency and strategy implementation of the service centers. Based on data envelopment analysis and panel regression, the proclaimed benefits of a service oriented strategy are evaluated. We find that there is evidence that a service oriented strategy enables higher operational efficiency and profitability. Hence, based on applied research this dissertation provides general insights about how to turn aftermarket services into a profitable growth engine. 1.
