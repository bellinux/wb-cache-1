He stated that no focused inspection would be required. Cain also noted that a debris event was recorded on the orbiter's wing leading edge sensors, but it was far below the force that would indicate a problem, and would not impact the mission. The late inspection that is routinely performed prior to re-entry would give <b>any</b> <b>additional</b> <b>information,</b> but Cain stated [...] "We're not concerned that it's done any kind of damage that would be any concern to us, certainly not critical damage." ...|$|E
500|$|Aaron Rutkoff of Wall Street Journal touted the installment; [...] "The writers' oratorical impulses {{were mostly}} kept in check, giving us instead an action-filled A plot {{in the field}} and a suspenseful B plot on the farm, and both have serious stakes. The motif {{connecting}} the two plots: knives. This episode was all about knives." [...] Gary Roszko of The Huffington Post stated that [...] "18 Miles Out" [...] was a nice transition from what he thought was the typical development of the show. Sepinwall asserted that the episode was the strongest telecast since the second-season premiere, [...] "What Lies Ahead". While CraveOnline writer Blair Marnell felt {{that it was a good}} telecast, he declared that [...] "18 Miles Out" [...] was slightly inferior to its predecessor. New York Starlee Kine was critical of the flashbacks in the episode, who described the process as baffling. She wrote, [...] "It was done in the oddest way, though, where the flashbacks didn’t add <b>any</b> <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> than that which we already knew. It was as though the writers thought a flashback could be used in place of their characters having backstories, instead of as a vehicle to convey them." ...|$|E

It consisted of [...] "a light card, with several images set upon it" [...] fastened {{on the four}} spokes of a wheel which was turned around by heat inside a glass or horn cylinder, [...] "so that you would think the immages to bee living creatures by their motion". The description seems rather close to a simple four-phase animation device depicted and described in Henry V. Hopwood's 1899 book Living Pictures (see picture). Hopwood gave no name, date or <b>any</b> <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> for this toy that rotated when blown upon. However, Bate's device {{as seen in the}} accompanying illustration seems not to have actually animated the images, but rather to have moved the images around spatially.|$|E
2500|$|According to Hellman, Eastman's {{script was}} used almost exactly as written with {{no need for}} any rewrites. However, Hellman felt {{the first part of}} the script had too much expository {{material}} involving Gashade's trip through the desert as he returned to the mining camp, so Hellman simply deleted it, noting that [...] "Exposition, by its very nature, is artificial." [...] After discarding the material, Hellman began shooting at approximately [...] "Page 10" [...] of the screenplay. He felt the story was [...] "perfectly simple" [...] and didn't need <b>any</b> <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> to help the audience figure things out. Nonetheless, Corman insisted on Hellman inserting a certain amount of exposition that Corman hoped would help explain the story. Corman felt that if mention was made three times during the course of the film that Gashade had a brother, audiences would not be confused by the climactic sequence. Hellman reluctantly agreed.|$|E

2500|$|Because of {{evidence}} management concerns, San Diego County Sheriff's Department investigators initially {{did not attempt}} to power up the phone or operate it, fearing that they might over write evidence contained in its memory. Instead, they tried to determine whether forensic software was available which would allow them to examine that model of phone. On August 15, unable to identify any such technology, a detective turned on the phone and conducted a manual search of it, finding that the voice-mail message was not stored on the phone. They did not request that AT try to retrieve the deleted message from its servers. Later, on September 21, a homicide investigator with the department announced that they would be searching it again, using what they described as [...] "new technology" [...] to copy the phone's data for further investigation. Because Zahau's cell phone was a newer model that investigators were not familiar with, they had previously been unsure what software they could use to accomplish this task. In early October, investigators completed their second examination of the cell phone. They stated that they did not uncover <b>any</b> <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> and would soon return the phone to Zahau's family.|$|E

60|$|As we thus {{skirted the}} back-side of the towns, for {{we did not}} enter any village, till we got to Provincetown, we read their {{histories}} under our umbrellas, rarely meeting anybody. The old accounts are the richest in topography, which was what we wanted most; and, indeed, in most things else, for I find that the readable parts of the modern accounts of these towns consist, in a great measure, of quotations, acknowledged and unacknowledged, from the older ones, without <b>any</b> <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> of equal interest;--town histories, which at length run into {{a history of the}} Church of that place, that being the only story they have to tell, and conclude by quoting the Latin epitaphs of the old pastors, having been written in the good old days of Latin and of Greek.
