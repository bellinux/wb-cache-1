5|$|Central to the {{structure}} and plot {{of the show is}} the use of electronic surveillance and wiretap technologies by the police—hence the title The Wire. Salon.com described the title as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> viewer's experience: the wiretaps provide the police with access to a secret world, just as the show does for the viewer. Simon has discussed the use of camera shots of surveillance equipment, or shots that appear to be taken from the equipment itself, to emphasize the volume of surveillance in modern life and the characters' need to sift through this information.|$|E
5|$|The boiling frog is {{a parable}} {{describing}} a frog being slowly boiled alive. The {{premise is that}} if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of threats that arise gradually.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Operation Ten-Go is revered {{to some degree}} in modern Japan as {{evidenced}} by appearances of the story in popular Japanese culture which usually portray the event as a brave, selfless, but futile, symbolic effort by the participating Japanese sailors to defend their homeland. One {{of the reasons the}} event may have such significance in Japanese culture is that the word Yamato was often used as a poetic name for Japan. Thus, the end of battleship Yamato could serve as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> end of the Japanese empire.|$|E

25|$|The term pons asinorum, in {{both its}} {{meanings}} {{as a bridge}} and as a test, is used as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> finding <b>the</b> middle term of a syllogism.|$|R
50|$|Nada is an Arabic word <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dewdrops in {{the morning}} and, as such, <b>a</b> poetic <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> concept of generosity, another {{possible}} translation of the same word.|$|R
5|$|A 5 hours, 9 {{minutes long}} biographical {{documentary}} film, , made by Vithalbhai Jhaveri in 1968, quoting Gandhi's words and using black & white archival footage and photographs, captures {{the history of}} those times. Ben Kingsley portrayed him in Richard Attenborough's 1982 film Gandhi, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. The 1996 film The Making of the Mahatma documented Gandhi's time in South Africa and his transformation from an inexperienced barrister to recognised political leader. Gandhi was a central figure in the 2006 Bollywood comedy film Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Jahnu Barua's Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara (I did not kill Gandhi), places contemporary society as a backdrop with its vanishing memory of Gandhi's values as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> senile forgetfulness of the protagonist of his 2005 film, writes Vinay Lal.|$|E
5|$|Antichrist Superstar is a rock opera concept album, and {{its title}} {{is based on}} the 1971 Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Jesus Christ Superstar. It is {{primarily}} an industrial metal record, and contains material which has been described as industrial rock and death metal, as well as progressive metal, new wave and gothic rock. The album's central storyline revolves around a supernatural being who seizes power in order to initiate an apocalyptic end event. The record is a social critique which utilizes this premise as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fascist elements of the Christian right in North America. The band's frontman has said that the underlying concept of Antichrist Superstar was both inspired by and a tribute to the work of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, specifically his philosophical concept of an Übermensch.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{was still}} {{divided by the}} {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War. Menem proposed an agenda of national reconciliation. First, he arranged the repatriation of the body of Juan Manuel de Rosas, a controversial 19th century governor, and proposed to reconcile his legacy with those of Bartolomé Mitre and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, who also fought in the Argentine Civil Wars. Menem intended to use the reconciliation of these historical Argentine figures as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> reconciliation of the Dirty War. However, although the repatriation and acceptance of Rosas was a success, the acceptance of the military regime was not.|$|E
50|$|A 1799 {{description}} of a failed proposal for a bridge from Howth to Holyhead is <b>a</b> mocking <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> failure of the Union Bill 1799, which succeeded next year as the Act of Union 1800.|$|R
50|$|The {{architect}} {{designed the}} building's exterior as <b>an</b> abstract <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> delta of the Ganges River. The wings {{on the roof}} symbolize unfolding lotus blossoms, and the green stone at the entrance resembles a flowing river.|$|R
2500|$|The {{double-decker}} outhouse {{has been}} used as <b>an</b> unflattering <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Trickle-down theory" [...] of politics, economics, command, management, labor relations, responsibility, etc. Depending on who is depicted on top and below, it is an easy and familiar cartoon.|$|R
5|$|First {{published}} in 2004 by Victor Gollancz Ltd, {{the book is}} Morgan's third novel, the first two {{being part of the}} Takeshi Kovacs series. Market Forces satirises corporate practices and globalisation and carries the theme of competition throughout the story. Violence is used as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> mechanisms underlying capitalism and assumptions about haves and have-nots are challenged. It won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 2005 and was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award. Though book reviewers gave it a mixed reception, Morgan's descriptive writing and action sequences received praise.|$|E
5|$|The {{sculpture}} {{has been}} used as a backdrop in commercial films, notably in the 2006 Hollywood film The Break-Up, which had to reshoot several scenes because the sculpture was under cover for the initial filming. It is also prominently featured in the ending scene of Source Code. Director Duncan Jones felt the structure was <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> movie's subject matter and aimed for it to be shown at the beginning and end of the movie. The sculpture served as an aesthetic and symbolic setting for the 2012 film The Vow when the lead characters share a kiss under it.|$|E
5|$|The video drew many {{comparisons}} to the rumors of Carey's deteriorating marriage at the time. Author Chris Nickson felt the video, like the song, served as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{things that were}} taking place in her life at the time. Rumors circulated that Mottola was controlling, abusive and would even monitor Carey's phone calls. For this reason, she is portrayed with tattered clothing and hair in the video, with the final moments showing her escape. It features Carey finally leaving the lonely and abusive marriage she once was part of, and finally breaking free into the outside world. Unlike the video, the lyrics spoke of setting your loved one free, {{because it is the}} best thing for them; showing that their love for the person should be greater than their own happiness.|$|E
50|$|According to David Hill, some {{scholars}} {{believe that the}} metaphor of being filled with light is {{a reference to the}} soul, but he notes that this was not <b>a</b> standard <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> soul in Jewish literature of the period.|$|R
500|$|The term [...] "victory women" [...] {{has been}} theorised as {{pointing}} to an association with valkyries. This theory is not universally accepted, and the reference {{has also been}} theorised as <b>a</b> simple <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> [...] "victorious sword" [...] (the stinging) of the bees.|$|R
25|$|One of the {{hallmarks}} of Persian gardens is the four-part garden laid out with axial paths that intersect at the garden's centre. This highly structured geometrical scheme, called the chahar bagh, became <b>a</b> powerful <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> organization and domestication of the landscape, itself a symbol of political territory.|$|R
5|$|Symbolism is used {{heavily in}} Blue Velvet. The most {{consistent}} symbolism {{in the film}} is an insect motif introduced {{at the end of}} the first scene, when the camera zooms in on a well-kept suburban lawn until it unearths a swarming underground nest of disgusting bugs. This is generally recognized as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> seedy underworld that Jeffrey will soon discover under the surface of his own suburban, Reaganesque paradise. The severed ear he finds is being overrun by black ants. The bug motif is recurrent throughout the film, most notably in the bug-like gas mask that Frank wears, but also the excuse that Jeffrey uses to gain access to Dorothy's apartment: he claims to be an insect exterminator. One of Frank's sinister accomplices is also consistently identified through the yellow jacket he wears, possibly reminiscent of the name of a type of wasp. Finally, a robin eating a bug on a fence becomes a topic of discussion in the last scene of the film. The robin, mentioned earlier by Sandy when she recounted her dream, represents love conquering evil.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{designs were}} done by Senri Kita, an artist {{new to the}} series. In contrast to previous Fire Emblem games, where the protagonist was of royal blood, the main character Ike {{was intended to be}} of lower social rank, a mercenary who becomes involved in royal politics and conflict rather than being born into it. Ike was born from the many ideas for new directions being suggested for the new 3D game, with many people wanting the protagonist everyone could empathize with. His status as a mercenary was a highly requested character trait by male staff. A character that returned from previous games was Jeigan, who was this time designed as a female character. Designing all the characters to be unique under the new conditions proved a challenge. This also resulted in higher-quality character artwork being produced during the initial design stages. The full-motion videos were created by Japanese animation studio Digital Frontier. Introducing the cutscenes into the game proved challenging for the team. The game's subtitle does not refer to a specific object or place, but instead acts as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> journeys of Ike and other characters.|$|E
5|$|The motif {{has many}} {{historical}} meanings. First, {{as a scientific}} and secular motif, it was only an astrological and zodiacal symbol. Under the Safavid and the first Qajar kings, it became more associated with Shia Islam. During the Safavid era, the lion and sun stood for the two pillars of society, {{the state and the}} Islamic religion. It became a national emblem during the Qajar era. In the 19th century, European visitors at the Qajar court attributed the lion and sun to remote antiquity; since then, it has acquired a nationalistic interpretation. During the reign of Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar and his successors, the form of the motif was substantially changed. A crown was also placed {{on the top of the}} symbol to represent the monarchy. Beginning in the reign of Fat′h-Ali, the Islamic aspect of the monarchy was de-emphasized. This shift affected the symbolism of the emblem. The meaning of the symbol changed several times between the Qajar era and the 1979 revolution. The lion could be interpreted as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Shia Imam Ali or it could be symbolizing Rostam, the legendary hero of Iranian mythology. The Sun has alternately been interpreted as symbol of motherland or Jamshid, the mythical Shah of Iran.|$|E
50|$|A {{broken heart}} (also {{known as a}} heartbreak or heartache) is <b>a</b> term <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> intense emotional—and {{sometimes}} physical—stress or pain one feels at experiencing great longing. The concept is cross-cultural, often cited with reference to a desired or lost lover, and dates back at least 3,000 years.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of Freud's antiquities {{and their relationship}} to his psychoanalytic ideas around archaeology as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> understanding <b>the</b> human subject and the process of psychoanalysis as a therapeutic. This is invoked by looking at Susan Hiller's At the Freud Museum (1994), a site-responsive installation held at the Freud Museum London...|$|R
5|$|The song's {{original}} music video, {{directed by}} Samuel Bayer, depicts the band performing {{in a home}} being destroyed by a wrecking ball in <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> divorce. <b>The</b> clip was re-shot following the 9/11 attacks, with both the band and label deeming its imagery too similar {{to the collapse of}} the World Trade Center.|$|R
25|$|Computing {{hardware}} and its software have even become <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{operation of the}} universe.|$|E
25|$|The Velvet Rope {{was titled}} as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{emotional}} barricade preventing others from revealing their innermost thoughts; {{in comparison to}} the velvet rope used at film premieres and award shows, prohibiting access from spectators. It also served as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> barriers separating different classes of society. It was based on various events throughout her adolescence and early adulthood, resurfacing after attempted escapism.|$|E
25|$|The {{expression}} Tree of Life {{was used}} as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> phylogenetic tree of common descent in the evolutionary sense in a famous passage by Charles Darwin (1872).|$|E
500|$|Usually {{described}} as a psychological horror film, Black Swan can be also interpreted as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> achieving artistic perfection, with all the psychological and physical challenges one might encounter, i.e. [...] "the film can be perceived as <b>a</b> poetic <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> birth of <b>an</b> artist, that is, as a visual representation of Nina’s psychic odyssey toward achieving artistic perfection and of the {{price to be paid}} for it." ...|$|R
50|$|By {{making a}} purely {{transient}} work, that would deflate before the buyer’s eyes, Manzoni was parodying the traditional sculptural emphasis on permanence and mocking the traditional {{emphasis on the}} artist’s creative force. He was also using modern materials to suggest an aggressively modern aesthetic whilst creating <b>a</b> poetic <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> transience of life itself.|$|R
2500|$|American rock critic Robert Duncan used cargo cults as <b>an</b> {{organizing}} <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> social dislocations in 1960–1970s America in his 1984 book, The Noise. The 2013 art {{theme of}} the week-long annual Burning Man festival held in the Black Rock Desert, Nevada was titled [...] "Cargo Cult" [...] and directly references the John Frum cult.|$|R
25|$|Anglican Archbishop Peter Carnley {{used the}} story as a {{reference}} and <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> situation {{of women in the}} church in his sermon at the ordination of the first women priests in Australia on 7 March 1992 in St George's Cathedral, Perth.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, GZA and DJ Muggs (the {{producer}} for hip-hop group Cypress Hill) released collaboration album Grandmasters. Muggs provided all the production for the album, which saw GZA using chess as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rap game, with every song having a chess-themed title.|$|E
25|$|Outside Britain and the United States, other {{significant}} productions include Qiping Xu's 1986 production in China, which drew political parallels to Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards; Peter Stein's 1989 production in Italy which evoked images of twentieth century Fascism; Daniel Mesguich's 1989 production in Paris, which set the entire {{play in a}} crumbling library, acting as a symbol for Roman civilisation; Nenni Delmestre's 1992 production in Zagreb which acted as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> struggles of the Croatian people; and Silviu Purcărete's 1992 Romanian production, which explicitly avoided using the play as <b>a</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fall of Nicolae Ceaușescu (this production {{is one of the}} most successful plays ever staged in Romania, and it was revived every year up to 1997).|$|E
50|$|A Mans World an {{experimental}} film or avant garde, was shot late in 2003. The brutal world of boxing {{is not an}} obvious place to look in order to escape personal demons. But the bloody sport is <b>a</b> stark <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> salvation of <b>a</b> disaffected woman from the outskirts of Manchester who finds solace inside the ring.|$|R
40|$|We {{believe that}} the {{learning}} processes of contemporary organizations can be described by the jazz metaphor more effectively than by any other because jazz depends for its continual survival in the marketplace on one very important activity: constant learning and innovation. Jazz is an art form based in social learning and therefore <b>a</b> perfect <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> learning organization...|$|R
500|$|<b>A</b> kenning (poetic <b>metaphor)</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sun, álfröðull (literally [...] "elf disc"), is of {{uncertain}} meaning but is to some {{suggestive of}} a close link between elves and the sun.|$|R
