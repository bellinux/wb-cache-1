25|$|In 1882, Alger's father died. Alger {{continued}} to produce stories of honest boys outwitting evil, greedy squires and malicious youths. His work appeared in hardcover and paperback, and decades-old poems {{were published in}} anthologies. He led a busy life with street boys, Harvard classmates, and the social elite. In Massachusetts, he was regarded with the same reverence as Harriet Beecher Stowe. He tutored with never <b>a</b> <b>whisper</b> <b>of</b> scandal.|$|E

[...] Later that year, he created another forest bonsai that is known as Goshin Two. [...] When Naka died in 2004, one French site published a cartoon captioned (in translation): [...] "John Naka has gone.

500|$|Stephen Holden of The New York Times {{said that}} the album was [...] "refreshing", and that Collins was [...] "adept" [...] at setting a suspenseful or menacing mood. Holden {{described}} [...] "Only You Know and I Know" [...] as an [...] "angry love song" [...] that had some sampling of [...] "Motown" [...] style music mixed in. [...] "In 'One More Night', Mr. Collins's recent number-one hit, a ticking snare drum injects <b>a</b> <b>whisper</b> <b>of</b> lurking fear into a song that suggests a sweeter, tenderer reprise of 'Against All Odds'", says Holden. Holden concluded by saying [...] "On the surface, No Jacket Required, is an album bursting with soulful hooks and bright peppy tunes. But beneath its shiny exterior, Mr. Collins's drums and his voice carry on a disjunctive, enigmatic dialogue between heart and mind, obsession and repression." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1921, Lord Birkenhead, the Lord Chancellor of Great Britain, {{had opposed}} {{a bill that}} would have criminalised {{lesbianism}} on the grounds that [...] "of every thousand women... 999 have never even heard <b>a</b> <b>whisper</b> <b>of</b> these practices". In reality, awareness of lesbianism had been gradually increasing since World War I, but it was still a subject most people had never heard of, or perhaps just preferred to ignore. The Well of Loneliness made sexual inversion a subject of household conversation for the first time. The banning of the book drew so much attention to the very subject it was intended to suppress that it left British authorities wary of further attempts to censor books for lesbian content. In 1935, after a complaint about a health book entitled The Single Woman and Her Emotional Problems, a Home Office memo noted: [...] "It is notorious that the prosecution of the Well Of Loneliness resulted in infinitely greater publicity about lesbianism than if there had been no prosecution." ...|$|E
500|$|The 17 November 2006 Children in Need charity telethon {{included}} a segment featuring the Holby City cast performing {{a version of}} Hung Up by Madonna. [...] Although the character had not yet made her on-screen debut in the programme, Lewington as Maddy appeared in the sketch - as did fellow newcomers Peter Wingfield (Dan Clifford) and Phoebe Thomas (Maria Kendall) who also had yet to arrive in the show itself. The 16 November 2007 Children in Need appeal again contained a musical performance from Holby City cast members. Lewington, alongside Rakie Ayola (Kyla Tyson) and Phoebe Thomas (Maria Kendall) provided backing vocals for Sharon D Clarke (Lola Griffin), who performed a soul version of Aretha Franklin's signature song, Respect. Lewington said of these appearances: [...] "I had {{the time of my}} life...Woo hoo! Loved every second. Although I was a gibbering wreck before the live performance of 'Respect'. Sharon D Clarke was amazing, not <b>a</b> <b>whisper</b> <b>of</b> fear. I however was convinced that I was going to forget everything and stare blankly into the eyes of 14 million viewers or however many squillions there were watching. All went well though and I've {{got a little bit of}} history in my dvd collection ready for the grand kiddies!" [...] Lewington has also appeared in a Holby City vs. Casualty special episode of BBC Two quiz show The Weakest Link, alongside co-stars Phoebe Thomas, Tom Chambers (Sam Strachan), Duncan Pow (Linden Cullen) and Robert Powell (Mark Williams).|$|E

6000|$|Except for a {{luxuriance}} {{of grass}} and ferns, and two babbling streams of water, our old camp ground had not changed. I sat down with mingled emotions.

It was only men who changed in brief time. The long year of worry and dread and toil and pain had passed. It was nothing.
