When as-Salih Ayyub, who was in Syria at the time, heard of this, he rushed back to Egypt, avoiding Damietta, instead reaching Mansurah. There, he organized an army <b>and</b> <b>raised</b> <b>a</b> commando force which harassed the Crusaders.|$|E

Also around sunset, Diana turned about in an attempt to avoid being trapped in the shallows of the creek.

5|$|As Revenge was {{the nearest}} {{of the three}} pirate vessels to the Americans, Allen ordered Alligator boats lowered to run inshore and attack her. Some 40 men armed with small arms were put into the boats, with Allen {{personally}} taking command of the launch, Lieutenant Dale the cutter, and midshipman Henley the gig. Revenge was already underway {{by the time it}} was sighted and attempted to escape the Americans despite the lack of wind, using its sweeps. After the American boats had rowed about , the pirate schooner made an about-face <b>and</b> <b>raised</b> <b>a</b> red flag. Upon approaching the pirates, the American craft were fired on with both grape and round shot. The American boats returned fire with small arms and moved in to board the vessel. Rather than try to fight off the boarding attempt, the pirates abandoned Revenge while another schooner covered their escape. Alligator gig manned by Henley and four men was sent off to take Revenge as a prize.|$|E
5|$|Born at Podolskaya {{street in}} Saint Petersburg, Russia, Shostakovich {{was the second}} of three {{children}} of Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich and Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina. Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent (his family roots trace to {{the region of the}} town of Vileyka in today's Belarus), but his immediate forebears came from Siberia. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to Narym (near Tomsk) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitri Karakozov's assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk <b>and</b> <b>raised</b> <b>a</b> large family. His son, Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899. He then went to work as an engineer under Dmitri Mendeleev at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg. In 1903 he married another Siberian transplant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Russian Siberian native.|$|E
5|$|During 1191 the {{citizens}} of the city of London managed to acquire from Coutances and Prince John the recognition that the city was self-governing, something they had been attempting to secure for a number of years. This however, was not the grant of a complete charter of liberties, which did not occur until 1199. In February 1193 Coutances summoned a council to Oxford, to address problems of administration and defence after the recently received news of Richard's captivity in Germany. The council also took oaths of fealty to Richard. Prince John, however, hearing that Richard was in captivity, immediately went to France and swore homage to King Philip for Richard's lands, and then returned to England <b>and</b> <b>raised</b> <b>a</b> rebellion. Coutances proceeded to besiege Windsor Castle, which was held by Prince John's men. When John heard that Richard was going to be freed, he left England and went to France.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{continued}} to publicly support the Provisions of Oxford, but he secretly opened discussions with Pope Urban IV, {{hoping to be}} absolved from the oath he had made at Oxford. In June 1261, the King announced that Rome had released him from his promises and he promptly held a counter-coup {{with the support of}} Edward. He purged the ranks of the sheriffs of his enemies and seized back control of many of the royal castles. The baronial opposition, led by de Montfort and de Clare, were temporarily reunited in their opposition to Henry's actions, convening their own parliament, independent of the King, and establishing a rival system of local government across England. Henry and Eleanor mobilised their own supporters <b>and</b> <b>raised</b> <b>a</b> foreign mercenary army. Facing the threat of open civil war, the barons backed down: de Clare switched sides once again, de Montfort left for exile in France and the baronial resistance collapsed.|$|E
5|$|In 1846 the Mexican–American War began. Davis {{resigned}} his House seat {{in early}} June <b>and</b> <b>raised</b> <b>a</b> volunteer regiment, the 155th Infantry Regiment, becoming its colonel {{under the command}} of his former father-in-law, General Zachary Taylor. On July 21 the regiment sailed from New Orleans for Texas. Colonel Davis sought to arm his regiment with the M1841 Mississippi rifle. At this time, smoothbore muskets were still the primary infantry weapon, and any unit with rifles was considered special and designated as such. President James K. Polk had promised Davis the weapons if he would remain in Congress long enough for an important vote on the Walker tariff. General Winfield Scott objected on the basis that the weapons were insufficiently tested. Davis insisted and called in his promise from Polk, and his regiment was armed with the rifles, making it particularly effective in combat. The regiment became known as the Mississippi Rifles {{because it was the first}} to be fully armed with these new weapons. The incident was the start of a lifelong feud between Davis and Scott.|$|E
5|$|Soleil's {{squadron}} departed Rochefort on {{the evening}} of 24 September, aiming to bypass Hood's squadron in the dark. However at 01:00 on 25 September, with the wind coming from the northeast, lookouts on HMS Monarch spotted sails to the east. Hood's squadron was spread out, tacking southeast towards the Chassiron Lighthouse at Saint-Denis-d'Oléron with HMS Centaur in the centre, HMS Revenge to the east (or windward) and Monarch to the west. HMS Mars was also close by, {{with the rest of the}} squadron spread out in the rear. Hood's immediate reaction was that the sails must belong to a squadron of French ships of the line, and ordered his ships to form a line of battle in anticipation. Even as the signal was raised however, lookouts on Monarch identified the strangers as frigates and Hood abandoned his previous orders <b>and</b> <b>raised</b> <b>a</b> new signal ordering a general chase, confident that his ships could destroy the convoy even without the power and defensive capability of a line of battle.|$|E
