40|$|Allochthonous water frogs (gen. Pelophylax) {{have been}} {{repeatedly}} introduced in several European countries, causing dramatic {{consequences for the}} conservation of indigenous taxa. In Italy, invasive populations are known for northern regions, where they were introduced mainly for edible and scientific purposes. Here, we report the first detection of an alien population of water frogs in Central Italy, along the Resina valley (Umbria). Genetic analysis of the mitochondrial ND 3 gene polymorphism assigned some specimens to two different Pelophylax ridibundus clades widespread in Central and Eastern Europe. By contrast, two samples matched the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence of Pelophylax lessonae bergeri, an autochthonous taxon widespread in Central Italy, suggesting possible hybridization between alien and indigenous frogs. Finally, the specific haplotype of Pelophylax shqipericus, the <b>Albanian</b> <b>Pool</b> <b>Frog,</b> was also identified according to mtDNA polymorphism. This record, firstly reported for Italy, poses concerns {{for the conservation of}} this cryptic taxon, suggesting that international water frog trade may involve also particularly endangered species...|$|E

50|$|Pelophylax kl. esculentus is {{the fertile}} hybrid of the <b>pool</b> <b>frog</b> (Pelophylax lessonae) and the marsh frog (Pelophylax ridibundus). It reproduces by hybridogenesis (hemiclonally).|$|R
40|$|There {{are risks}} from disease in {{undertaking}} wild animal reintroduction programmes. Methods of disease risk analysis have been advocated {{to assess and}} mitigate these risks, and post-release health and disease surveillance {{can be used to}} assess the effectiveness of the disease risk analysis, but results for a reintroduction programme have not to date been recorded. We carried out a disease risk analysis for the reintroduction of <b>pool</b> <b>frogs</b> (Pelophylax lessonae) to England, using information gained from the literature and from diagnostic testing of Swedish <b>pool</b> <b>frogs</b> and native amphibians. Ranavirus and Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis were considered high-risk disease threats for <b>pool</b> <b>frogs</b> at the destination site. Quarantine was used to manage risks from disease due to these two agents at the reintroduction site: the quarantine barrier surrounded the reintroduced <b>pool</b> <b>frogs.</b> Post-release health surveillance was carried out through regular health examinations of amphibians in the field at the reintroduction site and collection and examination of dead amphibians. No significant health or disease problems were detected, but the detection rate of dead amphibians was very low. Methods to detect a higher proportion of dead reintroduced animals and closely related species are required to better assess the effects of reintroduction on health and disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{marsh frog}} (Pelophylax ridibundus) has been {{introduced}} in many places of Central and Western Europe due to commercial trades with Eastern Europe, and is rapidly replacing the native <b>pool</b> <b>frog</b> (P. lessonae). A large number of Pelophylax species are distributed in Eastern Europe and the strong phenotypic similarity between these species is rendering their identification hazardous. Consequently, alien populations of Pelophylax might not strictly be composed of P. ridibundus as previously suspected. In the present study, we analyzed the cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 genes of introduced and native Pelophylax from Switzerland (299 individuals), in order to properly identify the source populations of the invaders and the genetic status of the native species. Our study highlighted the occurrence of several genetic lineages of invasive frogs in western Switzerland. Unexpectedly, we also showed that several populations of the native <b>pool</b> <b>frog</b> (P. lessonae) cluster with the Italian <b>pool</b> <b>frog</b> P. bergeri from central Italy (considered by some authors as a subspecies of P. lessonae) Hence, these populations are probably also the result of introductions, meaning {{that the number of}} native P. lessonae populations is less important than expected in Switzerland. These findings have important implications concerning the conservation of the endemic <b>pool</b> <b>frog</b> populations, as the presence of multiple alien species could strongly affect their long-term subsistence...|$|R
50|$|The {{edible frog}} Pelophylax kl. esculentus is a hybridogenetic hybrid of the <b>pool</b> <b>frog</b> Pelophylax lessonae and the marsh frog P. ridibundus. Its populations are {{maintained}} however through other crossings by hybridogenesis.|$|R
50|$|The {{species of}} {{amphibian}} native to Britain are the great crested newt, smooth newt, palmate newt, common toad, natterjack toad, common <b>frog</b> and the <b>pool</b> <b>frog.</b> Several other species have become naturalised.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Example crosses between <b>pool</b> <b>frog</b> (Pelophylax lessonae), {{marsh frog}} (P. ridibundus) and their hybrid - edible frog (P. kl. esculentus). First {{one is the}} primary {{hybridisation}} generating hybrid, second one is most widespread type of hybridogenesis.|$|R
50|$|For example, in {{the most}} {{widespread}} so called L-E system, edible frogs Pelophylax kl. esculentus (RE) produce gametes of the marsh frog P. ridibundus (R) and mate with coexisting <b>pool</b> <b>frogs</b> Pelophylax lessonae (L gametes) - see below in the middle.|$|R
50|$|Super-numerary {{chromosome}} numbers can be unstable, {{which can}} lead to instability in the genetics of the hybrid. The European edible frog appears to be a species, but is actually triploid semi-permanent hybrids between <b>pool</b> <b>frogs</b> and marsh frogs. In most populations, the edible frog population is dependent on the presence of {{at least one of the}} parents species to be maintained as each individual need two gene sets from one parent species and one from the other. Also, the male sex determination gene in the hybrids is only found in the genome of the <b>pool</b> <b>frog,</b> further undermining stability. Such instability can also lead to rapid reduction of chromosome numbers, creating reproductive barriers and thus allowing speciation.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pool</b> <b>frog</b> has {{not always}} been {{recognised}} as a native British species. Part of {{the reason for this is}} that other similar species are known to have been introduced. However research has now shown that a native origin is most likely.|$|R
50|$|The Pelophylax esculentus complex {{consists}} of the hybrid taxon - edible frog P. kl. esculentus (genotype RL) and parental species - marsh frog P. ridibundus (RR) and <b>pool</b> <b>frog</b> P. lessonae (LL). Hybrids are females and males, which is unusual, because hybrids of other hybridogenic species are only females.|$|R
50|$|The Italian <b>pool</b> <b>frog</b> (Pelophylax bergeri) is {{a species}} of frog in the family Ranidae. Found on the {{mainland}} of Italy and the Mediterranean islands of Sicily, Elba, Corsica and Sardinia, its natural habitats are rivers, swamps, freshwater lakes and freshwater marshes. It is not considered threatened by the IUCN.|$|R
50|$|There live 75 {{species of}} {{amphibians}} in Europe, 56 of them endemic. Amphibian fauna is richest in southern Europe. Several ranids (common frog, moor <b>frog,</b> marsh <b>frog,</b> <b>pool</b> <b>frog,</b> agile frog), bufonids (common toad, natterjack toad, European green toad), hylids (European tree frog, Mediterranean tree frog) {{and a few}} pelobatids (common spadefoot), midwife toads and bombinatorids (yellow-bellied toad, European fire-bellied toad) discoglossids (e.g. common midwife toad, 10 Mediterranean species) live in Europe. For a complete list, see List of European amphibians.|$|R
50|$|For example, the {{edible frog}} Pelophylax kl. esculentus (mostly RL genome), {{which is a}} hybridogenetic hybrid of the marsh frog P. ridibundus (RR) and the <b>pool</b> <b>frog</b> P. lessonae (LL), usually {{excludes}} the lessonae genome (L) and generates gametes of the P. ridibundus (R). In other words, edible frogs produce gametes of marsh frogs.|$|R
50|$|The Puebla <b>frog</b> or Pueblan <b>pool</b> <b>frog,</b> Lithobates pueblae, is {{a species}} of frog in the family Ranidae endemic to Necaxa River near Huauchinango, Puebla state, Mexico, where it is known as rana poblana. It was thought to {{probably}} be extinct until 2010 when Dr. Georg Hantke from the National Museum of Scotland re-discovered it.|$|R
5|$|Some {{species of}} anurans {{hybridize}} readily. For instance, the edible frog (Pelophylax esculentus) is a hybrid between the <b>pool</b> <b>frog</b> (P. lessonae) and the marsh frog (P. ridibundus). The fire-bellied toads Bombina bombina and B. variegata {{are similar in}} forming hybrids. These are less fertile than their parents, giving rise to a hybrid zone where the hybrids are prevalent.|$|R
40|$|Current {{identification}} {{methods for}} distinguishing north-west European brown and water frogs are discussed and tested, {{to allow the}} presentation here, of more accurate guidance on their separation. Novel methods for the identification of species and individuals including novel, non-invasive, biometrical methods have been developed. Random amplified DNA (RAPD) analyses were used to clarify the native British status for <b>pool</b> <b>frog,</b> Rana lessonae. Using nine arbitrary primers, 160 polymorphisms were detected in 174 <b>pool</b> <b>frogs</b> from 11 European locations. Clear geographical groupings were recorded, and the Norfolk, Norwegian and Swedish individuals formed a closely related northern clade. Phylograms constructed from RAPD data were consistent with an unexpected post-glacial colonisation route, in which the northern clade derived from migration out of Italy, via Hungary and Poland, but cryptic glacial refugia in Eastern Europe are an alternative explanation. Similarity indices suggested a complex origin for the Swiss population which also supported more northerly refugia than traditionally assumed. The RAPD analyses concur with a parallel microsatellite investigation supporting native status for Norfolk <b>pool</b> <b>frogs,</b> and have helped to prompt a programme for re-establishing the northern clade in England after extinction in the 1990 s. Field research (in S. E. London) is also reported here which demonstrated extreme population changes in native amphibians, including the apparent extinction of water frogs; potential ecological causes are discussed. Population monitoring showed evidence for multiple spawnings {{in the same year}} by the same individual female water frogs (behaviour that is disputed by some herpetologists) ...|$|R
5000|$|The main {{threat to}} the Italian <b>pool</b> <b>frog</b> is the {{draining}} of its aquatic habitats; {{as a result of}} this, the population appears to be declining at a slow rate. However, the frog has a wide range, is common in many places and has a large total population, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as being of [...] "least concern".|$|R
50|$|Another major {{success has}} been the {{reintroduction}} of captive-bred hazel dormice, {{with a large number}} of Wildwood stock transferred to sites in the Midlands and Yorkshire. Other on-going projects include DNA and behavioural research on pine martens with Waterford Institute of Technology in Éire; funding for the <b>pool</b> <b>frog</b> reintroduction with Herpetological ConservationTrust/English Nature; water shrew husbandry with Imperial College, London; and in-situ breeding of harvest mice with Chester Zoo.|$|R
50|$|The Italian <b>pool</b> <b>frog</b> is {{native to}} the {{mainland}} of Italy, south of Rimini and Genoa, and to the islands of Sicily, Elba and Corsica. It has been introduced into Sardinia. Its typical habitat is sluggish streams and rivers, lakes and swamps and their environs, and it is present at altitudes of 1800 m or more. It has been introduced into the United Kingdom but whether it persists there is unclear.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pool</b> <b>frog</b> (Pelophylax lessonae) is a European frog. It {{is one of}} {{only four}} {{amphibian}} species recognized by the UK government as protected under its Biodiversity Action Plan. The reasons for declining populations are decreased pond habitat from human encroachment and also air pollution leading to over-nitrification of pond waters. Its specific name was chosen by the Italian herpetologist Lorenzo Camerano in order to honour his master Michele Lessona.|$|R
5000|$|The {{marsh frog}} (Pelophylax ridibundus) {{is the largest}} frog native to Europe and belongs {{to the family of}} true frogs. It is very similar in {{appearance}} to the closely related edible <b>frog</b> and <b>pool</b> <b>frog.</b> These three species, now again in the genus Pelophylax, are often referred to as [...] "green frogs" [...] to distinguish them from the more terrestrial European Rana species, which are known as [...] "brown frogs" [...] (best exemplified by the common frog Rana temporaria).|$|R
5|$|A few {{animal species}} {{are the result}} of hybridization. The Lonicera fly is a natural hybrid. The American red wolf appears to be a hybrid of the gray wolf and the coyote, {{although}} its taxonomic status has been a subject of controversy. The European edible frog is a semi-permanent hybrid between <b>pool</b> <b>frogs</b> and marsh frogs; its population requires the continued presence of {{at least one of the}} parent species. Cave paintings indicate that the European bison is a natural hybrid of the aurochs and the steppe bison.|$|R
5000|$|The Herpetological Conservation Trust website {{states that}} [...] "The <b>Pool</b> <b>Frog</b> is a European frog and was {{formerly}} recorded from two sites in East Anglia {{although it was}} lost from one of these {{in the middle of}} the 19th century. It was presumed extinct in the wild at the last remaining site by 1995. A single individual known from this population survived in captivity until 1999. Other populations have become established in the UK and it is known that some of these included individuals of British origin in their founding stock." ...|$|R
40|$|The mere {{presence}} of predators often decreases {{the growth rate}} of prey individuals, which devote energy and time to predator avoidance mechanisms. However, if time constraints are present, the prey individuals might be forced to neglect predators in order to grow faster. Amphibian larvae lower their activity when exposed to predators, which increases their survival probability but lowers their growth rate. I investigated how time constraints affect the growth strategies of <b>pool</b> <b>frogs</b> (Rana lessonae) in the presence and absence of caged (i. e., nonlethal) predators, and what the consequences are for their survival during the larval and the subsequent terrestrial life stage. In two outdoor experiments, I limited the available development time by delaying the hatching date, and by simulating pond drying. Tadpoles whose hatching date was experimentally delayed reduced their development and their activity less in the presence of predators than did control tadpoles. The survival consequences of caged predators was similar for early- and late-hatched tadpoles. Tadpoles exposed to falling water level increased their developmental rate compared to constant-water-level controls. In response to predators, however, tadpoles decreased activity and developmental rate, regardless of the water level treatment. Survival in treatments combining fast drying and caged predators was lower than in the other treatments. These results suggest that time constraints critically affect the role of predators in the life history of <b>pool</b> <b>frogs</b> and might change the relative importance of lethal and nonlethal predator effects on their population dynamics...|$|R
