5|$|Players {{navigate}} the knight {{to collide with}} enemies. The elevation of an enemy {{in relation to the}} player's knight determines the outcome of the collision. If the protagonist is higher than the enemy, the villain is defeated and vice versa. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other. A defeated enemy will turn into <b>an</b> <b>egg</b> that falls toward the bottom of the screen, which a player can collect for points. <b>An</b> <b>egg</b> that sits on a platform long enough will hatch into a new knight; if the player does not pick him up, he will gain a new mount and must be defeated again.|$|E
5|$|The {{follicular}} {{phase is}} {{the first part of}} the ovarian cycle. During this phase, the ovarian follicles mature and get ready to release <b>an</b> <b>egg.</b> The latter part of this phase overlaps with the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle.|$|E

5|$|A shade named Durza, {{along with}} a group of urgals, ambushes a party of three elves. After he and the urgals kill the other elves, Durza {{attempts}} to steal <b>an</b> <b>egg,</b> that one of the female elves carries, but is foiled when she causes it to vanish. Infuriated, he renders her unconscious with a ball of fire and abducts her.|$|E
5|$|An {{abnormal}} behaviour of birds in captivity, performed primarily by commercial egg-laying hens, characterized by pecking {{damage to the}} , the surrounding skin and underlying tissue. Vent pecking frequently occurs immediately after <b>an</b> <b>egg</b> has been laid when the cloaca often remains partly everted exposing the mucosa.|$|E
5|$|Apart from pit-trap-forming taxa, {{the biology}} {{of members of the}} family Myrmeleontidae, to which the antlions belong, has been little studied. The {{life-cycle}} begins with oviposition (egg-laying) in a suitable location. The female antlion repeatedly taps the prospective laying site with the tip of her abdomen and then inserts her ovipositor into the substrate and lays <b>an</b> <b>egg.</b>|$|E

5|$|Female Murray cod, upon first {{reaching}} sexual maturity, have egg {{counts of}} no more than 10,000. Very large female Murray cod can have egg counts as high as 80,000–90,000, although a recent, very large 33-kg specimen yielded <b>an</b> <b>egg</b> count of 110,000 viable eggs. Egg counts in female Murray cod of all sizes are relatively low compared to many fish species.|$|E

5|$|Holometabolism, or {{complete}} metamorphosis, {{is where the}} insect changes in four stages, <b>an</b> <b>egg</b> or embryo, a larva, a pupa and the adult or imago. In these species, <b>an</b> <b>egg</b> hatches to produce a larva, which is generally worm-like in form. This worm-like form {{can be one of}} several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa, a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon. There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate. Obtect pupae are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin. Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage, and emerge as adults. Butterflies are a well-known example of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, although most insects use this life cycle. Some insects have evolved this system to hypermetamorphosis.|$|E
5|$|In hatching, mambas break {{though the}} egg shell with <b>an</b> <b>egg</b> tooth and {{are born with}} fully {{developed}} venom glands; capable of inflicting a potentially lethal bite minutes after hatching. The body of the newly hatched snake contains the residues of the egg yolk, and assimilates them to sustain the young snake until it finds its first prey.|$|E
5|$|Like other amphibians, {{the life}} cycle of a frog {{normally}} starts in water with <b>an</b> <b>egg</b> that hatches into a limbless larva with gills, commonly known as a tadpole. After further growth, during which it develops limbs and lungs, the tadpole undergoes metamorphosis in which its appearance and internal organs are rearranged. After this it is able to leave the water as a miniature, air-breathing frog.|$|E

5|$|Like other ants, Myrmecia ants {{begin as}} <b>an</b> <b>egg.</b> If the egg is fertilised, the ant becomes a diploid female; if not, {{it becomes a}} haploid male. They develop through {{complete}} metamorphosis, meaning that they pass through larval and pupal stages before emerging as adults.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species are}} oviparous {{like most other}} fish, laying their eggs in the water. In most oviparous shark species, <b>an</b> <b>egg</b> case with the {{consistency}} of leather protects the developing embryo(s). These cases may be corkscrewed into crevices for protection. Once empty, the egg case {{is known as a}} mermaid's purse, and can wash up on shore. Oviparous sharks include the horn shark, catshark, Port Jackson shark, and swellshark.|$|E

5|$|The female usually {{attaches}} the egg {{case to a}} substrate, inserts it into a suitably protective crevice, or {{carries it}} about until just before the eggs hatch. Some species, however, are ovoviviparous, keeping the eggs inside their body, with or without <b>an</b> <b>egg</b> case, until they hatch. At least one genus, Diploptera, is fully viviparous.|$|E
