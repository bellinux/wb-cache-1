40|$|Aims A cardiac muscle {{performance}} {{assessment in}} terms of <b>acid-alkaline</b> <b>balance</b> has never been carried out before. The studies show {{it is possible to}} evaluate indirectly aerobic, anaerobic and phosphocreatine processes in the cardiac muscle using ECG only. The aim is to study the capabilities of <b>acid-alkaline</b> <b>balance</b> measurement in the cardiac muscle using ECG only, in combination with the heart cycle phase analysis. Materials and methods The ECG of the ascending aorta is recorded with Cardiocode device. Amplitudes of the derivatives of leading and trailing edge of R, L and j waves are measured. The QRS complex amplitude depends on the amplitudes of the septum and myocardium muscles contractions. The septum is contracted because of the lesser resistance since the myocardium muscles are not loaded yet. When the myocardium muscles are contracted, they take a heavier load since the septum remains under static strain. It allows evaluating the difference in the energy consumption for each group of the muscles according to the respective ECG derivative. It will suffice to compare the amplitudes of the first derivative characterizing the muscle contractility rate during Q–R and R–S periods. Results Over 500 patients were examined. As a result, ranges of every biochemical reaction changes have been established. The ranges of energy consumption assessment for the biochemical processes featuring the biochemical reactions in cardiac muscles are defined. Conclusion The ECG heart cycle phase analysis allows obtaining the <b>acid-alkaline</b> <b>balance</b> data of biochemical reactions governing the cardiac muscle contraction that is an important diagnostic marker. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{accelerating}} {{methods of}} elimination of strontium from rats by {{changing of the}} acid- base blood balance {{and the effect of}} metabolic acidosis on its intensity were considered. It is shown that the strontium salt accumulated in the poisoned organism causes changing of acid- alkaline balance toward acidosis. Further experimental change of <b>acid-alkaline</b> <b>balance</b> towards metabolic acidosis can be used to accelerate the elimination of strontium from poisoned organism...|$|E
40|$|Salivary α-amylase (sAA) and chromogranin A (sCgA) {{are at the}} {{forefront}} of current biochemical research on anxiety. Their use is being driven by the sudden surge of interest in “salivaomics,” a new field in medicine studying saliva’s genetic code, proteome and methabolom. Interestingly, it is not the primary functions of the enzyme and the protein, but the ingenious capture of their secondary ones (maintenance of the <b>acid-alkaline</b> <b>balance</b> and bactericidal / antifungal action) that allows for a swift, precise and pain-free measurement under physical and mental duress. Upon stimulation, sAA and sCgA are almost simultaneously released. Studying them allows {{a closer look at the}} autonomic nervous system (ANS) as opposed to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), which involves a long cascade of complex, hard to measure and interpret bio-chemical reactions...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the acid-base balance and partial {{pressure}} of blood gases of participants during a 100 -km run. Fourteen experienced amateur ultramarathon runners (age: 43. 36 ± 11. 83 years; height: 175. 29 ± 6. 98 cm; weight: 72. 12 ± 7. 36 kg) completed the 100 -km run. Blood samples were taken before the run; after 25, 50, 75, and 100 km; and 12 and 24 hours after the run. There were significant differences (p< 0. 05) between the mean values registered for <b>acid-alkaline</b> <b>balance,</b> buffering alkalies, and current bicarbonate in each segment of the run, especially during the third, fourth, and fifth segments of the run (i. e., between 50 and 100 km), and there were only significant differences associated with buffering alkalies and current bicarbonate during the recovery. However, all the changes were within the physiological norm. A significant decrease in the compressibility of oxygen was observed after 100 km (from 92. 80 ± 15. 67 to 88. 36 ± 13. 71 mmHg) and continued during the recovery to 75. 06 ± 8. 60 mmHg 12 h after the run. Also there was a decrease in saturation to a mean value of 93. 78 ± 3. 10 at 12 h after the run. Generally the amateurs runners are able to adjust their running speed so as not to provoke a significant acid-base imbalance or lactate acid accumulation...|$|E
