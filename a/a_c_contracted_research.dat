40|$|Stauromedusae have {{relatively}} few macromorphological characters, making both their taxonomy and identification difficult. For this reason, histological characters are also {{employed in the}} taxonomy of the group. This study presents {{a detailed description of}} the histomorphology of Haliclystus antarcticus Pfeffer, 1889 (Cnidaria, Staurozoa). We make new observations for the species and for the class, and address functional, taxonomical, and evolutionary aspects of staurozoan histo-anatomy. A complete reconstruction of H. antarcticus body plan is used to guide a more detailed observation, based on light microscopy, of structures rarely cited in the literature, such as the intertentacular lobules, the ostia between adjacent perradial pockets, and the male and female gonadal vesicles. Two possible regions of nematocyst formation are hypothesized and discussed. We also provide a review of the current use of histological characters in the taxonomy of the group. Understanding the body plan of stauromedusae is a challenge, because each single individual presents characters found in medusae and in polyps of other medusozoans. Comprehensive histological descriptions are important to establish relations of homology within Staurozoa and Cnidaria, providing crucial data on their evolution. J. Morphol.

Rates of convergence associated with these methods are obtained here as functions of the paths (n, T (n)) along which n and T go to infinity. These results show that, under suitable assumptions, consistency requires T (n) {{to be at least}} of the same order as n, whereas an optimal rate of n is reached for T (n) of the order of n 2. If convergence to the space of common components is considered, consistency holds irrespective of the path (T (n) thus can be arbitrarily slow); the optimal rate is still n, but only requires T (n) to be of the order of n. ∗Research supported by <b>an</b> <b>A.</b> R. <b>C.</b> <b>contract</b> of the Communaute ́ française de Belgique, the Fond...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the role of}} various constituencies in the corporate governance of a corporation {{from the perspective of}} incomplete contracts. A strict shareholder value orientation {{in the sense of a}} rule that at any time firm decisions should be made strictly in the interest of the pr sent shareholders would make it difficult for the firm to establish long-term relationships as the potential partners would have to fear that, at a later stage of the co-operation, the shareholders or a management acting only on their behalf could exploit them because of the inevitable incompleteness of long-term contracts. One way of mitigating these problems is to put in place a corporate governance system which gives some active role to the other stakeholders or constituencies, or which makes their interests a well-defined element of the objective function of the firm. A commitment not to follow a policy of strict shareholder value maximization ex pos can be efficient x ante. Such a system would clearly differ from what is advocated by proponents of a "stakeholder approach", as it would limit the rights of the other constituencies to those which would have been agreed upon in <b>a</b> <b>c</b> stitutional <b>contract</b> concluded between the...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand {{for information about the}} economic impact of agricultural carbon (C) sequestration in the developing world, but as yet no studies have assessed the potential for farmers in the highland tropics to participate in <b>C</b> <b>contracts.</b> In this paper we show how an econometric-process simulation model, designed to simulate the value of terrace and agroforestry investments, can be used to assess the economic feasibility of C sequestration. We use this model to simulate the impact of <b>C</b> <b>contracts</b> on the adoption of terraces and agroforestry practices in the highlands of northern Peru. The analysis shows that participation in <b>C</b> <b>contracts</b> could increase adoption of terraces and agroforestry practices, with the rate of adoption depending on the C accumulation rate and key factors affecting terrace productivity such as field slope. The simulation results show there is a relatively low economic potential for C sequestration in this agricultural system at C prices below $ 50 per MgC, but that potential increases substantially for C prices above $ 50 per MgC. Under favorable conditions for <b>C</b> sequestration and <b>a</b> <b>C</b> price of $ 100 per MgC, terrace and agroforesty adoption and C sequestration have the potential to raise per capita incomes by up to 15 % on farms with steeply sloped fields, and reduce poverty by as much as 9 %...|$|R
