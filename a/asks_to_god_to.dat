50|$|With {{regard to}} leaving Egypt, the Elohist {{presents}} a more elaborate tale than the Jahwist. Firstly, the Elohist version expands on the supposed cruelty of the Egyptians by presenting them as asking for difficult work such as bricks without straw. And secondly, whereas the Jahwist {{version of the}} Plagues of Egypt involves Moses only acting as an intercessor <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>God</b> <b>to</b> stop each plague that God has wrought, the Elohist instead presents Moses as threatening the Pharaoh, and then bringing the plague down on the Egyptians himself. To the Elohist, {{the threat of the}} passover is enough to cause the Egyptians to chase the Israelites out, whereas the Jahwist presents the Egyptians as reluctantly giving in, and then changing their mind, and chasing after them to bring them back.|$|R

5|$|William Cragh (born ca. 1262, died {{some time}} after 1307), was a medieval Welsh warrior and {{supporter}} of Rhys ap Maredudd, lord of the lands of Ystrad Tywi, in his rebellion against King Edward I of England. Captured in 1290 by the son of William de Briouze, the Cambro-Norman Lord of Gower, he was tried and found guilty of having killed thirteenmen. Cragh was executed just outside Swansea within sight of de Briouze's Swansea Castle, twice, as the gallows collapsed during his first hanging. Lady Mary de Briouze decided for reasons unknown to intercede on Cragh's behalf, and prayed to the deceased Bishop of Hereford, Thomas de Cantilupe, requesting him <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>God</b> <b>to</b> bring Cragh back from the dead.

2500|$|The Fathers of the Church dwell {{constantly}} on the symbolism of this hour. Noon is the hour {{when the sun is}} at its full, it is the image of Divine splendour, the plenitude of God, the time of grace; at the sixth hour Abraham received the three angels. We should pray at noon, says St. Ambrose, because that is the time when the Divine light is in its fulness. Origen, St. Augustine, and several others regard this hour as favourable to prayer. Lastly and above all, it was the hour when Christ was nailed to the Cross; this memory excelling all the others left a still visible trace in most of the liturgy of this hour. This scene from Good Friday is the background for Sext. [...] "Lead us not into temptation" [...] is the message of this hour.

5000|$|The Danza de los Voladores (Dance of the Flyers), or Palo Volador (pole flying), is {{an ancient}} Mesoamerican ceremony/ritual still {{performed}} today, albeit in modified form, in isolated pockets in Mexico.

The ritual consists of dance and the climbing of a 30-meter pole from which four of the five participants then launch themselves tied with ropes to descend to the ground. The fifth remains on top of the pole, dancing and playing a flute and drum. According to one myth, the ritual was created <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the <b>gods</b> <b>to</b> end a severe drought.

500|$|Historian Robert Bartlett has {{commented that}} [...] "one {{of the largest}} {{uncertainties}} in {{the whole story of}} the death and resurrection of William Cragh is why Lady Mary [...] interceded for him", but intercede she did. John of Baggeham, when questioned about her motivation 18 years after the event, could only reply that [...] "Lady Mary had sought the body of this William, he did not know why". [...] Before the execution she had <b>asked</b> her husband <b>to</b> spare the two condemned men, but he had refused. Then on hearing that Trahaern ap Hywel was dead, and believing that Cragh was still alive, she once again asked that he be handed over to her, but de Briouze delayed until he was convinced that Cragh was also dead. Then [...] "he granted him [...] to the said lady, such as he was, and ordered him to be taken down from the gallows". Lady Mary had [...] "a special devotion" [...] to Thomas de Cantilupe, the deceased Bishop of Hereford, and in her own words, upon hearing of Cragh's death, [...] "on bended knee, she asked Saint Thomas de Cantilupe <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>God</b> <b>to</b> restore life to William Cragh".|$|R
5000|$|Brown further recounted, [...] "We {{walked to}} the {{university}} campus and there found the commander, Dr. Ernesto (Che) Guevara (who had previously been befriended by Adventist), with an assistant looking over {{the map of the}} city. He soon came over and spoke with us, requesting the school to provide food for doctors, nurses, and others who might be coming through during the next few days. When we indicated that we had a problem in obtaining milk and food, he indicated that we were now in the Free Territory of Cuba, and that the rebel soldiers would see to it that we received all that was necessary.... At noon of that first day, about one hundred men came in for dinner. Mrs. Pena, our acting matron, had them sit at the tables. Then she explained the procedure in our cafeteria, adding that it is our custom always <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>God</b> <b>to</b> bless the food before we begin <b>to</b> eat. She <b>asked</b> Mr. Santos, our food-factory manager, to pray. As he started, the rebels, who had been sitting down, stood up, turned in Mr. Santos' direction, and stood in complete silence during the prayer." ...|$|R

50|$|According to the quran, one day, Noah {{received}} a revelation from God, {{in which he}} was told that no one would believe the message now aside from those who have already submitted <b>to</b> <b>God.</b> Noah's frustration at the defiance of his people led him <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>God</b> <b>to</b> not leave even one sinner upon earth. Although there is no proof that God accepted his prayer (as there is many examples of accepted prayers, such as in case of Yunus, Lut (Lot), Suleyman (Solomon) etc., even Noah's prayer in some other shape was accepted), God decreed that a terrible flood would come (and yet, Qur'an doesn't say it came to cover whole Earth) and He ordered Noah to build a ship (Safina) which would save him and the believers from this dreadful calamity. Ever obedient <b>to</b> <b>God's</b> instructions, Noah went out in search of material with which to build the vessel. When Noah began building the Ark, the people who saw him at work laughed at him even more than before. Their conclusion was that he was surely a madman - they could not find any other reason why a man would build a huge vessel when no sea or river was nearby. Although Noah was now very old, the aged patriarch continued to work tirelessly until, at last, the Ship was finished.|$|R
5000|$|As {{we reach}} stanza three, we notice the speaker becomes desperate <b>to</b> {{reconnect}} with <b>God.</b> This is {{seen from the}} speaker continuously pleading <b>to</b> <b>God</b> from this stanza {{until the end of}} the psalm. They begin with [...] "Send thy truth and light, Let them guide me right" [...] (Sidney, 2009, p. 83). This shows that the speaker is <b>asking</b> <b>God</b> <b>to</b> guide him again through the use of [...] "truth and light" [...] (Sidney, 2009, p. 83). The light represents something pure and innocent and in this case may be a glimpse of light from Heaven. The speaker appears to have lost his way in some way or another for him <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>God</b> <b>to</b> send him things to guide him again, to what he labels as [...] "thy hill most holy" [...] (Sidney, 2009, p. 83). He goes on further, in his desperate plea, by saying [...] "To God's altars tho Will I boldly go" [...] (Sidney, 2009, p. 84) in stanza four. Here, the speaker is shown to claim that he would do anything for <b>God</b> in order <b>to</b> be reconnected with him. This leads into stanza five where he says, [...] "Then, lo, then I will With sweet music's skill Grateful meaning show thee: Then, God, yea, my God, I will sing abroad What great thanks I owe thee." [...] (Sidney, 2009, p. 84). The speaker, here, is saying that he will sing <b>to</b> everyone of <b>God's</b> glory and how he owes thanks <b>to</b> <b>God.</b> The desperation <b>to</b> reconnect with <b>God</b> is continuous throughout this stanza, especially when he refers <b>to</b> <b>God</b> as [...] "my God" [...] (Sidney, 2009, p. 84). Referring <b>to</b> <b>God</b> as his God establishes that he has complete faith in God. Further on in the stanza, when it says [...] "I will sing abroad what great thanks I owe thee" [...] (Sidney, 2009, p. 84) the speaker informs that he would sing loudly to those around him about God's greatness and how he is thankful for all God does for him.|$|R
5000|$|The album's track listing is {{arranged}} to fuel a conceptual interpretation. The album, which is penned by Sykes, is lyrically more positive and tongue-in-cheek {{in comparison to}} the dark lyricisms of the previous album, There Is a Hell. The album's lyrics are also focus on self-reflective themes of analysing the consequences of someone's actions on people's lives and transforming them into apologies and described as having [...] "a more considerate, contemplative and self-aware demeanour". Sykes explained that while There Is a Hell. examined mannerisms such as dealing with great amounts of depression, Sempiternal examines learning how to deal with that stress. Despite the proclaimed positivity of the album in an interview with Kerrang! magazine where they review the songs track by track Sykes makes several references to [...] "a problem" [...] which cohesively binds the tracks themes together. The lyrics are also cited as possessing anti-religious connotations, with Sykes summarising this by saying [...] "I'm an atheist so it's all about not believing in God. Before the album I was put in a position where I was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> believe in <b>God</b> <b>to</b> get better, I was in a shitty place and I was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> put my faith in God". The lyrical structure is also seen as following a [...] "yin-and-yang". Heard in songs like [...] "Can You Feel My Heart," [...] where the lyrics polarise with [...] "the higher I get, the lower I sink".It is the only album to feature Sykes playing the rhythm guitar.|$|R
