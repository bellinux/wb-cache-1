25|$|Over {{the next}} eight months since Cyclops' death, Emma started to train and {{improving}} her time to turn into her diamond form. She {{also seems to be}} traumatized from the death of Scott and began to <b>actually</b> <b>believe</b> her own lie that Black Bolt was the one who actually killed him. Emma wasted no time and began to prepare for a war with the Inhumans by making alliances with various teams of X-Men, with the last being Storm's X-Haven. She declares war on the Inhumans when Beast reports that the Terrigen cloud will soon saturate and render earth as completely uninhabitable for mutants, believing that they have no time to attempt negotiation. When Medusa learns the truth about why the X-Men went to war against the Inhumans, she willingly destroys the cloud and ends the possibility of future Inhuman manifestations so that the mutants can survive.|$|E
25|$|According to the tale, three {{brothers}} evaded Death, who {{gave them a}} choice of anything they wanted. The first brother chose a wand {{that could not be}} defeated in battle, the second brother asked for a way to bring back someone from the dead, and the third brother selected a cloak that made the wearer invisible, even to Death himself. Eventually, the first brother was killed, the second committed suicide, and finally, the third brother made Death a friend and gave the cloak to his son. The story is generally believed to refer to the Peverell brothers centuries ago, although very few <b>actually</b> <b>believe</b> the story to be fully true. Dumbledore believed that the Peverells were simply particularly powerful and ingenious wizard inventors. The sign of the Deathly Hallows had also been adopted as a personal symbol by dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald; therefore many wizards, such as Viktor Krum, mistakenly understood it to be a symbol of dark magic.|$|E
500|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} the current gambit of {{contemporary}} conspiracy theorists who use The Protocols is to claim that they [...] "really" [...] come from some group other than the Jews, such as fallen angels or alien invaders. Although {{it is hard to}} determine whether the conspiracy-minded <b>actually</b> <b>believe</b> this or are simply trying to sanitize a discredited text, skeptics argue that it does not make much difference, since they leave the actual, antisemitic text unchanged. The result is to give The Protocols credibility and circulation.|$|E

500|$|On 8 June 2008, {{news reports}} {{indicated}} that Pratchett had an experience {{which he described}} as: [...] "It is just possible that once you have got past all the gods that we have created with big beards and many human traits, just beyond all that, {{on the other side}} of physics, there just may be the ordered structure from which everything flows" [...] and [...] "I don't <b>actually</b> <b>believe</b> in anyone who could have put that in my head". He went into further detail on Front Row, in which he was asked if this was a shift in his beliefs: [...] "A shift in me in the sense I heard my father talk to me when I was in the garden one day. But I'm absolutely certain that what I heard was my memories of my father. An engram, or something in my head...This is not about God, but somewhere around there is where gods come from." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, [...] The Final Testament of the Holy Bible, {{depicted}} as [...] "the last {{book of the}} Bible" [...] was released on Good Friday, April 22, 2011.

2500|$|Satanic ritual {{abuse is}} also used to {{describe}} the actions of [...] "pseudo-satanists" [...] who sexually abuse children and use the trappings of satanic rituals and claims of magical powers to coerce and terrify victims, but do not <b>actually</b> <b>believe</b> in the rituals. A survey of more than 12,000 SRA allegations, which found no substantiating evidence for an intergenerational conspiracy, did document several examples of abuse by pseudo-satanists.|$|E

5000|$|Additionally, the reasoner is {{peculiar}} {{because he}} or she believes that he/she doesn't believe the statement (symbolically, [...] which follows from [...] because [...] ) even though he/she <b>actually</b> <b>believes</b> it.|$|R
2500|$|David Souter, one of {{the four}} justices in the plurality, added his own concurrence. He wished [...] "to {{emphasize}} that, in order to avoid liability, the public employer must not only reasonably investigate the third-party report, but must also <b>actually</b> <b>believe</b> it." [...] Without that criterion, he argued, the government [...] "can assert no legitimate interest strong enough to justify chilling protected expression." [...] That left it open for Churchill to argue on remand that the putatively disruptive speech issue was merely a pretext for an unjustified, retaliatory firing over her criticisms of the cross-training implementation.|$|E
2500|$|On March 23, 2007, Justin Paul Caulfield, a {{legal analyst}} for the sports {{magazine}} Inside Lacrosse, stated on Fox News that charges would soon be dropped. While the North Carolina Attorney General's Office first disputed the report, on April 11, 2007, it announced that it had dismissed all charges against the three lacrosse players. Cooper not only dismissed the charges but also took {{the unusual step of}} declaring the accused players innocent. Cooper also announced that Mangum would not be prosecuted, stating that investigators and attorneys that had interviewed her thought [...] "she may <b>actually</b> <b>believe</b> the many different stories that she has been telling" [...] and [...] "it's {{in the best interest of}} justice not to bring charges".|$|E
2500|$|Doing {{research}} into conspiracy theories {{for his work}} on Brought to Light, Moore came to develop his own opinions on the subject of a global conspiracy, stating that [...] "Yes, there is a conspiracy, indeed there are a great number of conspiracies, all tripping each other up... the main thing that I learned about conspiracy theories is that conspiracy theorists <b>actually</b> <b>believe</b> in the conspiracy because that is more comforting. The truth of the world is that it is chaotic. The truth is, {{that it is not the}} Jewish banking conspiracy, or the grey aliens, or the twelve-foot reptiloids from another dimension that are in control, the truth is far more frightening; no-one is in control, the world is rudderless." ...|$|E

60|$|You see, Old Granny Fox {{had become}} so used to {{thinking}} that she was smarter than any one else, unless it was Old Man Coyote, that she <b>actually</b> <b>believed</b> {{that no one was}} smart enough ever to surprise her. Yes, Sir, she <b>actually</b> <b>believed</b> that. Now, you know when a person reaches the point of thinking that no one else in all the Great World is quite so smart, that person is like Peter Rabbit when he made ready one winter day to jump out on the smooth ice of the Smiling Pool,--getting ready for a fall. It was this way with Old Granny Fox.|$|R

2500|$|The song [...] "Breakin' the Law" [...] {{was taken}} from Destroyer's first album We'll Build Them a Golden Bridge. The group vocals {{at the end of}} [...] "Breakin' the Law" [...] are {{credited}} to the Camp Northstar Kids' Chorus, a reference to the Canadian comedy film Meatballs. The chorus is actually every member of the band singing. Newman stated, [...] "I like the fact that people think that it's a kids' group... We made ourselves sound like a giant group, but we ended up sounding like little kids. I love {{the fact that in the}} Rolling Stone review they mention the chorus of kids. I just think it's great that people <b>actually</b> <b>believe</b> that, because it's such a fucking ridiculous thing for a band to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cantrell is {{critical}} of religion and Young Earth Creationism, satirizing them both in Alice In Chains' 2013 Album, The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here. Cantrell stated, [...] "There are two things {{you never want to}} get into a conversation or argument about: politics and religion. But fuck, I guess we're {{going to be talking about}} this for awhile". [...] "No one in the band claims to be an expert on religion, but the title of the song [...] comes from something that a lot of people <b>actually</b> <b>believe</b> in". Cantrell also stated that he’s sick of the hypocrisy that’s taken over many facets of organized religion. [...] "I think there’s overwhelming evidence that things aren’t working right now. We need to start growing up as a people. When you’re teaching people that being gay is a mortal sin, yet a good portion of the people teaching this are fucking kids, there’s a huge problem".|$|E
2500|$|The {{campaign}} {{expanded to}} include renewed harassment of prominent feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian, who had previously been a target of online harassment {{due in part to}} her YouTube video series Tropes vs. Women in Video Games, which analyzes sexist stereotypes in video games. Sarkeesian's attackers took her critical commentary as unfair and unwarranted, and considered her an interloper. After a new episode of Tropes vs. Women was released on August 24, 2014, Sarkeesian received rape and death threats, and private information including her home address was leaked; she was compelled to flee her home. At the XOXO arts and technology conference in Portland, Oregon, she said, in regard to the accusations that high-profile women were making up the threats against them, that [...] "one of the most radical things you can do is to <b>actually</b> <b>believe</b> women when they talk about their experiences". [...] "The perpetrators", Sarkeesian went on to say, [...] "do not see themselves as perpetrators at all... They see themselves as noble warriors".|$|E
50|$|Ixcel's cloning {{process was}} so {{accurate}} that the Clone possessed {{much of the}} original Smith's thoughts and memories, and <b>actually</b> <b>believed</b> himself to be the original. However, Ixcel programmed into the clone a deep-seated loathing of N Industries and Charlies Locke.|$|R
50|$|During {{his time}} with the Squad, Light {{demonstrates}} a simple desire to be liked by the other members. He sees his chance when a mysterious pie-armed attacker is on the loose but after faking a hit nobody <b>actually</b> <b>believes</b> Light has been pied.|$|R

2500|$|Perron {{followed}} {{up the next}} week with a second blog post on the subject. She interviewed Lane who states {{that she did not}} expect to be named during Portman's acceptance speech because a Fox Searchlight producer had asked her to stop giving interviews until after the Oscars were over: [...] "They were trying to create this façade that [...] had become a ballerina {{in a year and a}} half ... So I knew they didn't want to publicize anything about me." [...] Perron then states that Lane [...] "says she was more offended by that myth than any slight to her as a dancer who worked 'painstaking' hours on the set. She says she's talked to her colleagues about 'how unfortunate it is that, as professional dancers, we work so hard, but people can <b>actually</b> <b>believe</b> that it's easy enough to do it in a year. That's the thing that bothered me the most.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Policewoman [...] Annie Norris (Gretchen Mol) — A uniformed policewoman with an {{undergraduate}} psychology education from Fordham University who has aspirations {{of making the}} detective squad, Norris constantly struggles against sexist attitudes {{about the role of}} a woman in police work. Owing to her gender, her nickname among the detectives is [...] "No Nuts Norris". She is the only one on the force to whom Sam has revealed that he's from the future — although she doesn't <b>actually</b> <b>believe</b> him, she's the most willing of any of his colleagues to listen to and offer kind advice about his state of mind rather than simply dismissing him as crazy. After Sam's seemingly crazy prophecy results in him saving her life, Annie is less willing to simply dismiss his incredible stories. Annie fervently wishes to become a detective, like her comrades in the 125th; she is promoted to detective in the finale. Her BBC counterpart is WPC Annie Cartwright (Liz White).|$|E
