500|$|American street artist Fairey guest {{starred in}} [...] "Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart" [...] as himself. The {{graffiti}} art featuring Homer's {{face and the}} word [...] "dope" [...] that Bart creates in the episode is a reference to Fairey's Barack Obama [...] "Hope" [...] poster and his OBEY Giant image. Fairey has said that The Simpsons {{has been one of}} his favorite television shows since the early 1990s because of its [...] "blend of humor and social commentary", and he felt [...] "deeply honored" [...] to be included in an episode. Fairey wrote on his website that [...] "Part of being on The Simpsons, is you’re being honored as a reference point in culture." [...] He described the plot of the episode as [...] "great", adding that the staff members of the show [...] "were kind enough to indulge <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dialogue suggestions designed to make the social commentary more pointed (even though I had to make fun of myself to do so)." [...] This was Fairey's first acting performance. Street artists English, Scharf, and Conal also guest starred in the episode as themselves.|$|E
2500|$|On September 23, 2010, Q-Tip {{confirmed}} {{working on}} Jay-Z's follow up album to The Blueprint 3, saying {{the album was}} to hit stores by spring 2011. In May 2012 {{it was reported that}} Jay-Z would work on new music with Roc Nation producer Jahlil Beats. Beats told XXL: [...] "Me and Jay-Z been going back and forth.

[...] The album has been named one of the most anticipated albums of 2013 by Complex Magazine, MTV, and XXL Magazine. Production will come from Jahlil Beats, Kanye West, Rick Rubin, Swizz Beatz, Timbaland, and Pharrell Williams. Jay-Z also made an appearance on Justin Timberlake's comeback single [...] "Suit & Tie" [...] from his third studio album The 20/20 Experience, the song itself was produced by both Jay-Z and Timberlake's mutual friend, Timbaland. During the fifth game of the 2013 NBA Finals, Carter announced his twelfth studio album, Magna Carta Holy Grail, and was released on July 4, 2013. Not long after, Jay-Z confirmed that the hyphen in his stage name would be left out and officially stylized in all capital letters [...] Magna Carta Holy Grail debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and sold 528,000 copies in its first week, which bypassed its predicted debut in the range of 350,000 to 400,000.|$|E

60|$|I was {{impatient}} {{to see what}} this was; and to show, too, how much more admirable was the one which I should display to the Examining Board. I intimated this, gently, to the king, and it fired his curiosity. When the Board was assembled, I followed him in; and behind us came the candidates. One of these candidates was a bright young West Pointer of mine, and with him were <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> West Point professors.|$|E

60|$|At 10 p.m. I {{arrived at}} Mr. Williams' camp, at Taldangah, a dawk station near the western {{limit of the}} coal basin of the Damooda valley.

60|$|Now I {{must say}} that, in the heated {{condition}} I {{had been in}} ever since I came into Scotland, a speech like {{that was like a}} squirt of cold water into a thing full <b>of</b> steam.

6000|$|It was not, however, a {{time for}} sentiment, but for action--we had met [...] {{regarding}} the future, not the past; so I produced the short document [...] I had already prepared.

I will leave <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> men here with your garrison, and in the morning will come out with a strong party and three or four bullock drays to fetch in all your portable property. They can make another trip for your potatoes and such of your crops as can be got in. After the sharp lesson the natives have had here they are not likely to venture in this neighbourhood again for some time; and, indeed, now that they find that the whole settlement is aroused and on its guard I doubt whether we shall hear anything more of them at present, and possibly you may, when matters settle down again, find your house just as it is left." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may believe," [...] {{continued}} the guide, [...] "that I was disgusted at their cowardice; so, to shame them, {{as well as}} to do what I could for the travellers, I loaded <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mules with meat, and said I would set off alone. This had the desired effect, for three men volunteered to go with me. When we reached the hut we found that six of the ten poor fellows were dead. The bodies of two who had died just before our arrival were lying in the corner over there behind Quashy. They were more like skeletons covered with skin than corpses. The four who still lived were in the corner here beside me, huddled together for warmth, and so worn out by hunger and despair that they did not seem to care at first that we had come to save them. We warmed and fed them, however, brought them gradually round, and at last took them back to the farm. They all recovered. During the time they were snowed up the poor fellows had eaten their mules and dogs. I have no doubt that if the ground were clear of snow you would find the bones of these animals scattered about still." ...|$|E

5000|$|Backstreets of Desire {{included}} a novel mariachi {{version of the}} Jimi Hendrix standard “Hey Joe” that was a hit in Europe, rising to number one in Spain and France. DeVille said about [...] "Hey Joe": [...] "The song originally comes from the Texas-Mexico border area ... They call it Texico. I tried, instead of doing something that sounded like Jimi Hendrix {{that would have been}} a cliché, I tried to take the song back to the way that it must originally have sounded, which would be with mariachis. It's classic, but it's classic with a little twist. A little different. I put a bit of pachuco Canal Street slang talking. I added <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> verses <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own."

6000|$|... "Well, sir, I {{lived there}} during that winter. I {{did not find}} it {{altogether}} dull, for I had several bits of excitement. For {{a month or so}} bears and wolves came down and fought over the carcass of the whale. When that was eaten up they turned their attention to me, {{and over and over again}} they tried to break in. They had better have left me alone, for though they were strong enough to have pulled away the rocks that blocked the entrance, they could not stand fire. As I had any amount of rope, I used to soak it in rock-oil, set it on fire, and shove it out of the entrance. Twice small bears managed to wriggle up the passage, but I had sharpened the boat-hook and managed to kill them both. One skin made me a whole suit, and the other a first-rate blanket. Not that it was ever unpleasantly cold, for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> big candles, and the thick coating of snow over it, kept the place as warm as I cared for. Occasionally, when the bears had cleared off, I went out, climbed the mast, and got fresh supplies down. They had made desperate efforts to get at the meat, but the face of the rock was luckily too smooth for them to get any hold. When spring came and the ice broke up, I planted the mast on the top of the cliff with the sail fastened as a flag, and a month after the sea was clear a whaler came in and took me off. That was how I pretty well lost the use of my tongue, and though I am better than I was, I don't use it much now except on duty." ...|$|E
60|$|My dear Lady Beaumont, {{your letter}} and the {{accounts}} it contains of the winter-garden, gave me great pleasure. I cannot but think, that under your care, {{it will grow}} up {{into one of the}} most beautiful and interesting spots in England. We all here have a longing desire to see it. I have mentioned the high opinion we have of it to <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> friends, persons of taste living in this country, who are determined, the first time they are called up to London, to turn aside to visit it; which I said they might without scruple do, if they mentioned my name to the gardener. My sister begs me to say, that she is aware how long she has been in your debt, and that she should have written before now, but that, as I have, latterly, been in frequent communication with Coleorton, she thought it as well to defer answering your letter. Do you see the Courier newspaper at Dunmow? I ask on account of a little poem upon the comet, which I have read in it to-day. Though with several defects, and some feeble and constrained expressions, it has great merit, and is far superior to the run, not merely of newspaper, but of modern poetry in general. I half suspect it to be Coleridge's, for though it is, in parts, inferior to him, I know no other writer of the day who can do so well. It consists of five stanzas, in the measure of the 'Fairy Queen.' It is to be found in last Saturday's paper, November 16th. If you don't see the Courier we will transcribe it for you. As so much of this letter is taken up with my verses, I will e'en trespass still further on your indulgence, and conclude with a sonnet, which I wrote some time ago upon the poet, John Dyer. If you have not read the 'Fleece,' I would strongly recommend it to you. The character of Dyer, as a patriot, a citizen, and a tender-hearted friend of humanity was, in some respects, injurious to him as a poet, and has induced him to dwell, in his poem, upon processes which, however important in themselves, were unsusceptible of being poetically treated. Accordingly, his poem is, in several places, dry and heavy; but its beauties are innumerable, and of a high order. In point of Imagination and purity of style, I am not sure that he is not superior to any writer in verse since the time of Milton.|$|E
6000|$|... “It was in North Wales,” said Treddleford, “that {{my sister}} met with her sensational {{carriage}} accident last year. She {{was on her}} way to a garden-party at Lady Nineveh’s, about the only garden-party that ever comes to pass in those parts in the course of the year, and therefore a thing that she would have been very sorry to miss. She was driving a young horse that she’d only bought a week or two previously, warranted to be perfectly steady with motor traffic, bicycles, and other common objects of the roadside. The animal lived up to its reputation, and passed the most explosive of motor-bikes with an indifference that almost amounted to apathy. However, I suppose we all draw the line somewhere, and this particular cob drew it at travelling wild beast shows. Of course my sister didn’t know that, but she knew it very distinctly when she turned a sharp corner and found herself in a mixed company of camels, piebald horses, and canary-coloured vans. The dogcart was overturned in a ditch and kicked to splinters, and the cob went home across country. Neither my sister nor the groom was hurt, but the problem of how to get to the Nineveh garden-party, some three miles distant, seemed rather difficult to solve; once there, of course, my sister would easily find some one to drive her home. ‘I suppose you wouldn’t care for the loan of <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> camels?’ the showman suggested, in humorous sympathy. ‘I would,’ said my sister, who had ridden camel-back in Egypt, and she overruled the objections of the groom, who hadn’t. She picked out two of the most presentable-looking of the beasts and had them dusted and made as tidy as was possible at short notice, and set out for the Nineveh mansion. You may imagine the sensation that her small but imposing caravan created when she arrived at the hall door. The entire garden-party flocked up to gape. My sister was rather glad to slip down from her camel, and the groom was thankful to scramble down from his. Then young Billy Doulton, of the Dragoon Guards, who has been a lot at Aden and thinks he knows camel-language backwards, thought he would show off by making the beasts kneel down in orthodox fashion. Unfortunately camel words-of-command are not the same all the world over; these were magnificent Turkestan camels, accustomed to stride up the stony terraces of mountain passes, and when Doulton shouted at them they went side by side up the front steps, into the entrance hall, and up the grand staircase. The German governess met them just at the turn of the corridor. The Ninevehs nursed her with devoted attention for weeks, and when I last heard from them she was well enough to go about her duties again, but the doctor says she will always suffer from Hagenbeck heart.” ...|$|E

I wonder whether the servants in that house will read these remarks about the chalkmark? That the Cornhill Magazine is taken in in that house I know. In fact I have seen it there. In fact I have read it there. In fact I have written it there. In a word, the house to which I allude is mine--the [...] "editor's private residence," [...] to which, in spite of prayers, entreaties, commands, and threats, authors, and ladies especially, WILL send their communications, although they won't understand that they injure their own interests by so doing; for how {{is a man who has}} his own work to do, his own exquisite inventions to form and perfect--Maria to rescue from the unprincipled Earl--the atrocious General to confound in his own machinations--the angelic Dean to promote to a bishopric, and so forth--how is a man to do all this, under a hundred interruptions, and keep his nerves and temper in that just and equable state in which they ought to be when he comes to assume the critical office? As you will send here, ladies, I must tell you you have a much worse chance than if you forward your valuable articles to Cornhill. Here your papers arrive, at dinner-time, we will say. Do you suppose that is a pleasant period, and that we are to criticise you between the ovum and malum, between the soup and the dessert? I have touched, I think, on this subject before. I say again, if you want real justice shown you, don't send your papers to the private residence. At home, for instance, yesterday, having given strict orders that I was to receive nobody, [...] "except on business," [...] do you suppose a smiling young Scottish gentleman, who forced himself into my study, and there announced himself as agent of a Cattle-food Company, was received with pleasure? There, as I sat in my arm-chair, suppose he had proposed to draw <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> teeth, would I have been pleased? I could have throttled that agent. I dare say the whole of that day's work will be found tinged with a ferocious misanthropy, occasioned by my clever young friend's intrusion. Cattle-food, indeed! As if beans, oats, warm mashes, and a ball, are to be pushed down a man's throat just as he is meditating on the great social problem, or (for I think it was my epic I was going to touch up) just as he was about to soar to the height of the empyrean! ...|$|E
