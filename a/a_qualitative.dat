5|$|Lanthanum {{fluoride}} is insoluble {{in water}} {{and can be used}} as <b>a</b> <b>qualitative</b> test for the presence of La3+. The heavier halides are all very soluble deliquescent compounds. The anhydrous halides are produced by direct reaction of their elements, as heating the hydrates causes hydrolysis: for example, heating hydrated LaCl3 produces LaOCl.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{bromides}} of the pre-transition metals (groups 1, 2, and 3, {{along with}} the lanthanides and actinides in the +2 and +3 oxidation states) are mostly ionic, while nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular bromides, as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above. Silver bromide is very insoluble in water and is thus often used as <b>a</b> <b>qualitative</b> test for bromine.|$|E

30|$|<b>As</b> noted earlier, <b>qualitative</b> {{interviews}} with principals provided rich {{information about the}} way they configure a bundle of HR practices for new teachers in their school (i.e. HR architecture). Following the presentation of the qualitative results, quantitative results extend the qualitative analyses which examine the link between the HR architecture and principals’ leadership style. <b>As</b> <b>qualitative</b> data were analysed first and were transformed into quantised data in order to link with the survey data, qualitative results are presented first below, followed by the quantitative findings.|$|R
5|$|In December 1962, Combat Development Command (CDC) drafted <b>a</b> <b>Qualitative</b> Material Requirement (QMR) for an interim, {{commercial}} off-the-shelf (COTS) aircraft, with a 140-knot (161mph, 259km/h) cruise speed and a 1,500-pound (680kg) payload. This {{was seen as}} an attempt by Army officials, anticipating the potential of the D-255, to acquire an interim aircraft to fill the escort role until the Army could determine the requirements for a dedicated armed helicopter. However, the Secretary of the Army disapproved the interim approach and directed that the Army look for a more advanced system that would dramatically improve over current helicopter designs.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War {{provided}} a testing ground for numerous innovations in warfare, and Mallory was {{in position to}} provide support for many of them. His advocacy of armored vessels has been described and is the development most closely associated with his name, but he encouraged the development of several other weapons. For example, he favored the use of rifled guns, {{as opposed to the}} smoothbore muzzle loaders used in the Union Navy. The favored gun was a rifle designed by the head of his Office of Ordnance and Hydrography, Lieutenant John Mercer Brooke. The Brooke rifle gave Rebel gunners <b>a</b> <b>qualitative</b> advantage over their Yankee counterparts that persisted {{to the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} method often depends largely on what the {{researcher}} intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a survey questionnaire to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's social actions may choose ethnographic participant observation or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or 'triangulate', quantitative and qualitative methods {{as part of a}} 'multi-strategy' design. For instance, a quantitative study may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample, and then combined with <b>a</b> <b>qualitative</b> interview to determine the play of agency.|$|E

Finally, we will give <b>an</b> <b>qualitative</b> and quantitative evaluation of our results. ...|$|R
