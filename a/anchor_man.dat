50|$|In deep waters, such {{as those}} that prevailed in the Pacific Ocean along the United States West Coast, the Coast and Geodetic Survey could rely upon shore {{stations}} to support radio acoustic ranging because the deep water allowed sound to travel to the coast. Along the United States East Coast, where shallower waters prevailed, sound had greater difficulty in reaching the coast, and the Coast and Geodetic Survey relied more heavily on <b>anchored</b> <b>manned</b> station ships, and later unmanned moored buoys, to support radio acoustic ranging.|$|R
5000|$|... "Every {{political}} issue claiming {{the attention of}} a world public has its 'experts"—news managers, <b>anchor</b> <b>men,</b> ax grinders, and anglers. The great merit of this book is to demonstrate that, on the Palestinian issue, these experts speak from utter ignorance. Millions of people the world over, smothered by false history and propaganda, will be grateful for this clear account of the origins of the Palestinians. From Time Immemorial does not grudge these unhappy people their rights. It does, however, dissolve the claims made by nationalist agitators and correct the false history by which these unfortunate Arabs are imposed upon and exploited." ...|$|R

500|$|Shannon, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Provo Wallis, escorted her prize into Halifax, arriving there on 6 June. On {{the entry of}} the two frigates into the harbour, the naval ships already at <b>anchor</b> <b>manned</b> their yards, bands played martial music and each ship Shannon passed greeted her with cheers. The 320 American survivors of the battle were interned on Melville Island in 1813, and their ship, taken into British service and renamed HMS Chesapeake, was used to ferry prisoners from Melville Island to England's Dartmoor Prison. Many officers were paroled to Halifax, but some began a riot at a performance of a patriotic song about Chesapeakes defeat. Parole restrictions were tightened: beginning in 1814, paroled officers were required to attend a monthly muster on Melville Island, and those who violated their parole were confined to the prison.|$|R
50|$|His {{earliest}} known {{work is the}} Ancoratus (the well <b>anchored</b> <b>man),</b> {{which includes}} arguments against Arianism and the teachings of Origen. Aside from the polemics by which he is known, Epiphanius wrote a work of biblical antiquarianism, called, for one of its sections, On Weights and Measures (περί μέτρων καί στάθμων). It was composed in Constantinople for a Persian priest, in 392, and survives in Syriac, Armenian, and Georgian translations (this last is found in Shatberd ms 1141 along with Physiologus and De Gemmis). The first section discusses the canon of the Old Testament and its versions, the second of measures and weights, and the third, the geography of Palestine. The texts appear {{not to have been}} given a polish but consist of rough notes and sketches, as Allen A. Shaw, a modern commentator, concluded; nevertheless Epiphanius' work on metrology was important in the history of measurement.|$|R

60|$|And {{talking of}} stokeholds, firemen, and trimmers, men whose heavy labour has {{not a single}} redeeming feature; which is unhealthy, uninspiring, arduous, without the reward of {{personal}} pride in it; sheer, hard, brutalising toil, belonging neither to earth nor sea, I greet with joy the advent for marine purposes of the internal combustion engine. The disappearance of the marine boiler will be a real progress, which anybody in sympathy with his kind must welcome.
