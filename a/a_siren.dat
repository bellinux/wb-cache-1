5|$|The apes are {{equipped}} with helmets, which feature <b>a</b> <b>siren</b> representing their alarm level: blue means relaxed, and unaware of the player characters' presence; yellow is alert; and red indicates fully alarmed, resulting in attempting to escape or becoming hostile. An ape's personality can also {{be determined by the}} colour of shorts: yellow is standard, light blue means timid, and red represents aggressive. Some apes {{are equipped}} with weaponry, allowing them to attack players, or binoculars that allow them to identify players from long distances. Players are required to capture a specific amount of apes to clear a level; remaining apes can be captured upon revisiting the level.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, it was {{determined}} a new tower needed to be built and the new structure was completed in 1868. The new lighthouse was a keeper's quarters with an attached lantern on the roof. The structure is of the same design as lighthouses at Sheffield Island in Norwalk; Morgan Point in Noank; Old Field Point Light and Plum Island in New York; and Block Island North in Rhode Island. The dwelling is made of granite and the lantern made of cast iron. The original Fresnel lens was installed in the new tower. In 1890, a fog whistle was installed {{and it would be}} replaced by <b>a</b> <b>siren</b> in 1905. The siren caused much distress to nearby residents and had to be modified.|$|E

5|$|The video {{starts with}} Knowles laying on a table, lit with a {{flashing}} bright red light. While <b>a</b> <b>siren</b> is blaring, she half-stands and sings while {{dancing on the}} table. She proceeds to an interrogation room {{similar to the one}} in the film Basic Instinct. Knowles sings the first verse in a house with a seashore backdrop. She wants to escape, and struggles with masked and uniformed guards in a hallway. She is then returned to the interrogation room. In between cuts, she sings in a corner of a room, is seen reflected in a mirror while screaming, and among a group of reporters. As the song closes, Knowles is shown crying. The video ends with a close-up view of Knowles putting on red lipstick. The scene shows only her lips.|$|E
5|$|Arthur and {{his mother}} Atlanna are flying over the Bermuda Triangle. As they get closer, Atlanna's {{necklace}} begins to glow and a surge of light and energy erupts from the ocean, causing cyclones which bring their plane down. Atlanna is kidnapped by <b>a</b> <b>siren,</b> but not before giving Arthur her necklace and calling him Orin. Ten years later, Arthur is charged for releasing dolphins from a marine park. His father bails him out of trouble, but gives him a stern lecture on responsibility. Later, Arthur tells his friend Eva that he felt like the dolphins were calling to him. While he's working, he is approached by a lighthouse keeper who identifies himself as McCaffery. The Coast Guard picks up an unidentified man floating in the Bermuda Triangle and pleading to warn Orin. Lt. Torres is sent to investigate the area. Arthur is also at the Triangle, and his necklace triggers another surge of light, which causes Torres to crash her jet. Brigman transports the John Doe to another facility, and persuades Torres to join his team. Brigman {{is looking for a}} connection between the disappearances of thousands of individuals, and their reappearance years later without ever aging a day.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the player}} choose {{to fulfill the}} promise, the protagonist begins her sophomore year at St. PigeoNation's largely as normal, but with one exception—she begins to have {{recurring}} dreams of her younger self and Ryouta, and her parents lying dead {{in front of an}} unfamiliar house. A mysterious man approaches them, promising to grant any wish that they make. On 2 September, she decides to check on Ryouta, who had gone to the infirmary earlier that day; the next morning, she fails to show up for class. Kazuaki asks Ryouta to retrieve their class' box of print handouts, and upon retrieving it, blood is discovered leaking from a corner of the box. Ryouta opens the lid, and it is revealed that the box contains the protagonist's severed head. <b>A</b> <b>siren</b> sounds and there is an order to evacuate to the gymnasium, where Ryouta overhears other students mention that more pieces of a human corpse were found in the other print boxes. Doubting the headmaster's explanation of a natural disaster occurring, Sakuya and Ryouta resolve to figure out the identity of the protagonist's killer and leave the gymnasium, discovering a large metal dome surrounding the school. Upon returning to their classroom and finding the box empty, Yuuya explains that the protagonist's body had been gathered in the chemistry lab, where Shuu performs an autopsy concluding that the protagonist died of asphyxiation caused by illness or poison with the dismemberment occurring afterwards.|$|E

25|$|A common {{example of}} Doppler shift {{is the change}} of pitch heard when a vehicle {{sounding}} <b>a</b> <b>siren</b> or horn approaches, passes, and recedes from an observer.

25|$|The {{earliest}} way of summoning volunteer firemen to a {{fire was}} by ringing of a bell, either mounted atop the fire station, {{or in the}} belfry of a local church. As electricity became available, the first fire sirens were manufactured. In 1886 French electrical engineer Gustave Trouvé, developed <b>a</b> <b>siren</b> to announce the silent arrival of his electric boats. Two early fire sirens were the Decot siren and Sterling Siren. Both started manufacturing fire sirens around 1900 to 1905. Many communities have since deactivated their fire sirens as pagers became available for fire department use.|$|E
