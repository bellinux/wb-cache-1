500|$|He finds a {{different}} signal for Sulu, {{but when he}} appears on the transporter padd, he is visibly older (Takei) and dressed as a barbarian. Sulu attacks the crew with a sword, but is disabled by Commander Spock (Jeffery Quinn) using a Vulcan nerve pinch. Sulu explains that to him 30 years have passed, with Chandris dying 15 years prior on a planet they named Caliban. Scotty manages to get <b>a</b> <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> another signal, but cannot re-materialize it without additional equipment. As Sulu explains that he cannot remember the information needed to release the Enterprise, Scotty manages to partly materialize Sulu's daughter Alana (Christina Moses) within a science lab but she remains trapped between universes. Attempting to retrieve the Romulan information, Spock attempts to mind meld with Sulu but the traumatic memories {{of the death of}} Chandris nearly kills them both. Spock is subsequently ordered to find {{a different}} means to exit the anomaly. As McCoy attempts to aid Sulu's memories with drugs, Kirk and Alana flirt with each other. Following further scans by Spock, they realise that she is tied to the anomaly and may return to the other universe once the Enterprise exits. Kirk initiates Spock's backup plan to implode the rift, but it damages the ship and knocks Alana unconscious.|$|E

2500|$|Downtown Jimmy of Extreme Gamer {{complained that}} the {{controls}} were too simple and criticized the camera for not having <b>a</b> <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> feature. While {{he felt that the}} graphics were not impressive, they still looked good enough to surpass his expectations of what the game looked like. Carolyn Petit of GameSpot found that the visuals captured the look of the anime very well. She stated that the controls were complex but featured little depth. She mentioned that attacks made the battle within the game feel [...] "tremendous", but stated the Ki building process would take attention away from the combat due to being time consuming and leaving the player wide open to an attack. She also had complaints over the multiplayer, claiming that as the screen became split down the middle on offline multiplayer, it would limit the player's view and that online multiplayer was better but would be riddled with opponents that would instantly log off if things don't go their way. Jeremy Jastrzab of PAL Gaming Network pointed out that the game was good by itself, but was not as good as any of the previous games, stating that [...] "there is no excuse for it being worse than its predecessors." ...|$|E
2500|$|Post-production {{began in}} November 2002, with the {{completion}} of the 4½ hour assembly cut of the film that Annie Collins had been completing over 2001 and 2002, from 4-hour dailies. For example, Théoden leading the charge went from 150 minutes of takes to a finished 90 seconds. Jackson reunited with longtime collaborator Jamie Selkirk to edit the final film. Like The Two Towers, they would have to deal with multiple storylines, and Jackson paid attention to each storyline at a time before deciding where to intercut. Most importantly they spent three weeks working on the last 45 minutes of the film, for appropriate intercutting and leaving out scenes such as the Mouth of Sauron, and the fates of characters like Legolas, Gimli, Éowyn and Faramir. The film inherited scenes originally planned to go into the second film, including the reforging of Narsil, Gollum's backstory, and Saruman's exit. But the Saruman scene posed a structural problem: killing off the second film's villain when the plot has Sauron as the main villain. Despite pick-ups and dubs, the scene was cut, causing controversy with fans and Saruman actor Christopher Lee, as well as a petition to restore the scene. Lee nonetheless contributed to the DVDs and was at the Copenhagen premiere, although he said he would never understand the reason for the cut and his relationship with Jackson was chilly. They would, however, later reconcile upon Lee's casting in Jackson's Hobbit films. Jackson only had <b>a</b> <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> 5 out of 10 reels, and had to churn out 3 reels in 3 weeks to help finish the film. It was finally completed on 12 November 2003. Jackson {{never had a chance to}} view the film in full due to the hectic schedule, and only saw the film from beginning to end on 1 December at the Wellington premiere; according to Elijah Wood, his response was [...] "yup, it's good, pretty good".|$|E
