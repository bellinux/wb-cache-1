500|$|The Powerpuff Girls series {{debut on}} November 18, 1998, {{was the highest}} rated premiere in Cartoon Network's history at the time. During its run, the series {{consistently}} scored the highest rating for an original series each week for the network across {{a wide range of}} demographics—from young children to adults. In October 2000, Cartoon Network credited the series for its Friday night prime time ratings win among cable networks. By the end of 2000, merchandising based on the series encompassed <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> products, including T-shirts, toys, video games, lunchboxes, and dishware. Concerning the show's success, Craig McCracken has stated, [...] "I thought it would get on Cartoon Network and college kids would watch it and there would be a few random T-shirts out there in the rave scene or in record shops. But I had no idea that it would take off to this extent." [...] Following the series' fourth season, the closing of Hanna-Barbera Productions and the death of its executive William Hanna in 2001, McCracken left it to focus on his new animated series, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, leaving Chris Savino to take his place and the production of The Powerpuff Girls was moved to Cartoon Network Studios. The show's last original run episode was on March 25, 2005; in all, six seasons were made. Cartoon Network had offered to give McCracken and Savino a seventh season of the series, but they believed the series had run its course.|$|E

Methods: Qualitative study was applied using eighteen semi-structured interviews with parents attending urban health centres in Tehran City. The recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim and the data were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings: Factors believed to influence the prevention of home injuries among urban children aged under 5  years are presented as five major themes. These were: the nature of injury and injury prevention, child-related factors, parent-related factors, living environment and society-related factors. Conclusions: The findings highlighted the need for greater support for parents. Half of the parents were struggling with barriers such as money and time. The study has implications for further research and practice to promote child safety at home...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 87 - 100). Fabricating low energy requiring and self-powered flexible electronic devices can decrease world energy need since energy demand {{seems to be}} one of the most fundamental problems in the near future. An excellent solution to overcome this drawback is fabricating functional and energy efficient materials. Fabricating high piezoelectric coefficient materials that are compatible with mass production, easy to produce, low cost and non-toxic is highly demanded in order to design highly sensitive sensors and self-powered devices. This thesis introduces piezoelectric polymer (PVDF-TrFE) based several sensor types, energy harvesting devices such as; prosthetic hand, cardiac sensors, electronic skin, which represent promising device architectures for flexible electronics. Semiconductor, metal, composite, piezoelectric materials or polymers can be drawn by thermal fiber drawing and by applying iterative size reduction technique, the geometry, size and length of fabricated structures can be controlled, which also enables us to design novel in fiber, fiber-array devices at nanoscale. First, to enhance PVDF-TrFE fiber performance, crystallinity of fibers was improved by introducing new designs and phase transition mechanism was investigated in fabricated films and fibers. Finally, conductive composite material for flexible interconnects and electrodes was developed. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> novel piezoelectric and conductive composite fibers were fabricated by using novel size reduction technique and fiber devices were designed for flexible electronics applications. by Mehmet Girayhan Say.
