40|$|The Pleistocene was {{characterized}} by fluctuations in climate causing repeated advances and retreats of glacial ice. The advancing ice sheets caused habitat fragmentation which initiated population divergence and speciation events between eastern and western avian populations within northern temperate forests. Based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences, North <b>American</b> <b>Wood</b> <b>Duck</b> (Aix sponsa) populations fit this model of divergence. However, mtDNA is maternally inherited, and thus may not reflect the genomic history of this species, because of male biased-dispersal, selection, or stochastic lineage sorting. To test the 2 ̆ 2 Late Pleistocene divergence 2 ̆ 2 hypothesis, I sequenced 11 independent nuclear introns (nuDNA) for 45 individuals sampled from eastern and western populations of Wood Ducks. Although two loci were significantly structured between East and West, overall population structure was considerably weaker for nuDNA (mean FST = 0. 027; range = 0. 0 to 0. 131) than for mtDNA (FST = 0. 31). Furthermore, genetic assignment tests and mark-recovery data were both consistent with male-biased dispersal between regions. Despite the influence of male-biased dispersal, estimates of time since divergence from both nuDNA and mtDNA {{were consistent with the}} last glacial advance splitting the two populations, thus supporting the Late Pleistocene divergence hypothesis. This study illustrates the utility of using nuDNA to test hypotheses derived from mtDNA analyses, which strengthens inferences of population history...|$|E

In addition to being generally perching and cavity-nesting, they also have fairly wide, rounded wings, elongated tails, and sometimes also relatively long legs. Many of the species exhibit {{a great deal of}} iridescent coloration in their plumage, even among females, and in a few species nearly the entire body plumage is iridescent. In some of these brilliantly colored forms, such as the comb duck, muscovy duck, and the spur-winged goose, there is a great difference in the sizes of the sexes even though they may be very similar in plumage patterning. In spite of their brilliant plumages, males of {{only a few of the}} species exhibit definite eclipse plumages, probably in part because most of the forms are tropical, with long or irregular breeding seasons. Pair bonding is generally seasonally established in the species that breed in temperate climates, while in the more tropical and seemingly more primitive species the pair bonds are weak and in a few cases apparently even nonexistent. The patterns of the downy young are typically well marked and characterized by white or yellow spots and stripes on a darker background; in many species they are not readily separable from the downy young of dabbling ducks. The two tribes are obviously closely related, and taxonomists are not agreed on which group some species such as the ringed teal, pink-eared duck, and Brazilian teal should be included in. However, to merge the tribes would make a comparatively large tribe and tend to obscure the well-defined differences in the behavior patterns and breeding biologies of these two groups...|$|E

50|$|Over 200 {{species of}} both migratory and {{non-migratory}} birds {{have been identified}} in the marsh. It serves as a wintering ground and stop-over point for migrating waterfowl, which gather in numbers as high as 4,000 in the fall. These waterfowl include <b>American</b> black <b>ducks,</b> <b>wood</b> <b>ducks,</b> and mallards. Constitution Marsh is also used by migrating pied-billed grebes, ospreys, northern harriers, and peregrine falcons; at least 2 and as many as 30 bald eagles can be found there in the winter. Autumn concentrations of swallows once peaked at 100,000, but have dwindled since the mid-1990s. Over 50 different bird species are known to breed within the wildlife sanctuary, including the least bittern, worm-eating warbler, Virginia rail, Louisiana waterthrush, northern cardinal, spotted sandpiper, gray catbird, common yellowthroat, marsh wren, eastern phoebe, swamp sparrow, and willow flycatcher, as well as the wood thrush, which breeds in the forest near the swamp. The marsh was included in bird habitat studies in 1986-1987 and again in 2005. The results revealed that the diversity of breeding bird species is steadily decreasing as the red-winged blackbird becomes dominant.|$|R
40|$|The <b>wood</b> <b>duck</b> is North America’s {{most widely}} {{distributed}} endemic species, {{and most of}} its wintering and breeding range falls within the 48 contiguous states (Fig. 1). The <b>wood</b> <b>duck</b> inhabits forested wetlands and, because of its need for nest cavities, is closely tied to North America’s remaining forest resources. Habitat destruction, market hunting, and liberal hunting seasons contributed to drastic declines and, in some cases, regional eradication of local <b>wood</b> <b>duck</b> populations. Subsequent implementation of hunting restrictions and the high reproductive rate of the species are responsible for the recovery of <b>wood</b> <b>duck</b> populations to current stable levels. As prairie duck populations continue to decline, hunting pressure on the <b>wood</b> <b>duck</b> continues to increase. The <b>wood</b> <b>duck</b> is popular with hunters and consistently ranks high among species in Atlantic and Mississippi flyway duck harvests.

Equally important to sustaining current <b>wood</b> <b>duck</b> population levels is an understanding of annual life cycle events and requirements...|$|R
40|$|The {{perching}} {{ducks and}} related gooselike forms are a {{diverse array of}} some fourteen species that are largely subtropical to tropical in occurrence. Although they vary in size from as little as {{about a half a}} pound in the 2 ̆ 2 pygmy geese 2 ̆ 2 (Nettapus) to more than twenty pounds in the spur-winged geese (Plectropterus), all possess some common features. *These include a tendency toward hole-nesting, especially in trees; sharp claws; associated perching abilities; and long tails that presumably increase braking effectiveness when landing in trees. Nearly all species exhibit extensive iridescent coloration in the body, especially on the upper wing surface; this coloration is often exhibited by females as well as males. As a result, this tribe includes some of the most beautifully arrayed species of the entire family, of which the North <b>American</b> <b>wood</b> <b>duck</b> is an excellent example, as is the closely related Asian mandarin duck (Aix galericulata). The wood duck is the only perching duck that is native to the United States or Canada, but inasmuch as Mexico must be regarded as a part of North America, the inclusion of the muscovy duck as a North American species is fully justified. Perching ducks, together with all of the following groups of waterfowl included in this book, are representatives of the large anatid subfamily Anatinae. Unlike the whistling ducks, swans, or true geese, species of this subfamily have a tarsal scale pattern that has vertically aligned scutes (scutellate condition) above the base of the middle toe, and the sexes are usually quite different in voice, plumage, and sexual behavior. These sexual differences {{can be attributed to the}} weaker and less permanent pair bonds characteristics of true ducks, with a renewal of pair bonds typically occurring each year. As a result, pair-forming behavior tends to be more complex and elaborate in these species, as a dual reflection of the greater and more frequent competition for mates and the need for safeguards in reducing or avoiding mixed pairings between species during the rather hurried pair-forming period. In these species, the males typically assume the initiative in pair-forming activities, and thus they are usually more colorful, more aggressive, and have the more elaborate pair-forming behavior patterns. On the other hand, the females retain a subdued, often concealing plumage pattern, associated with their assumption of most or all incubation and brood-rearing responsibilities. As a result, humans usually find it easy to recognize the distinctively plumaged males of most species, while the females of related species are often so similar that even experienced observers may find it difficult to identify them with certainty. Following the initiation of incubation, the males in this subfamily typically abandon the females and begin their postnuptial molt, during which they become flightless for a time and usually also acquire a more female-like body plumage. Thus, unlike the species in the subfamily Anserinae, typical ducks have two plumages, and thus two body molts, per year. In males this double molt is most apparent, since the 2 ̆ 2 eclipse 2 ̆ 2 plumage attained following the postnuptial molt is usually less colorful and often quite female-like. Although in all the species which have so far been studied the female also has a comparable summer molt and plumage, in most cases this plumage is so similar to the winter plumage that separate descriptions are not necessary. In most cases the 2 ̆ 2 eclipse 2 ̆ 2 plumage of males is held for only a few months, presumably to allow the male to regain the more brilliant plumage associated with pair formation as early as possible. In some cases, however, this 2 ̆ 2 nuptial 2 ̆ 2 plumage is not regained until well into winter (e. g., ruddy duck, Baikal teal, blue-winged teal), so that 2 ̆ 2 summer 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 winter 2 ̆ 2 plumages may be more or less recognizable. The situation is further complicated in the oldsquaw, which has a third partial molt in the fall (affecting both sexes but most apparent in the male) and which is restricted to the scapular region. Except in such special cases, the two major plumages of the male are referred to in the species accounts as 2 ̆ 2 nuptial 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 eclipse 2 ̆ 2 plumages, while the 2 ̆ 2 adult 2 ̆ 2 plumage of females refers to both of the comparable breeding and nonbreeding plumages. The 115 species of waterfowl that belong to the subfamily Anatinae are grouped into a number of tribes, most of which include one or more native North American species. The only major tribe of Anatinae that is not represented in this continent is the shelduck tribe Tadornini, which has representatives in both South America and Eurasia. It is true that there are some old records of Atlantic coast occurrences for the ruddy shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea) and the common shelduck (Tadorna tadorna), as well as a few more recent sight records (Audubon Field Notes, 16 : 73; American Birds, 26 : 842; 27 : 41), but these are quite possibly the result of escapes from captivity...|$|E
50|$|Landowners {{as well as}} {{park and}} refuge {{managers}} can encourage <b>wood</b> <b>ducks</b> by building <b>wood</b> <b>duck</b> nest boxes near lakes, ponds, and streams.

50|$|The {{population}} of the <b>wood</b> <b>duck</b> has increased {{a great deal in}} the last several years. The increase has been due to the work of many people constructing <b>wood</b> <b>duck</b> boxes and conserving vital habitat for the <b>wood</b> <b>ducks</b> to breed. During the open waterfowl season, U.S. hunters have only been allowed to take two <b>wood</b> <b>ducks</b> per day in the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyways. However, for the 2008-2009 season, the limit was raised to three. The <b>wood</b> <b>duck</b> limit remains at two in the Central Flyway and at seven in the Pacific Flyway. It is the second most commonly hunted duck in North America, after the mallard.|$|R

50|$|The {{population}} of the <b>wood</b> <b>duck</b> was in serious decline in the late 19th century {{as a result of}} severe habitat loss and market hunting both for meat and plumage for the ladies' hat market in Europe. By the beginning of the 20th century, <b>wood</b> <b>ducks</b> had virtually disappeared from much of their former range. In response to the Migratory Bird Treaty established in 1916 and enactment of the U.S. Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, <b>wood</b> <b>duck</b> populations began to recover slowly. By ending unregulated hunting and taking measures to protect remaining habitat, <b>wood</b> <b>duck</b> populations began to rebound in the 1920s. The development of the artificial nesting box in the 1930s gave an additional boost to <b>wood</b> <b>duck</b> production.|$|R
50|$|The {{well-established}} <b>wood</b> <b>duck</b> {{nest box}} program produces about 2,000 <b>wood</b> <b>duck</b> hatchlings a year. The boxes are prepared {{early in the}} year and checked frequently during nesting season to track hatches and remove non-viable eggs.|$|R
