Her classification, along with her high technical acumen, means that she is a valuable asset on any team.|$|E

40|$|Nafstad O, Grønstøl H: Variation in {{the level}} of grain defect light flecks <b>and</b> <b>spots</b> on cattle hides. Acta vet. scand. 2001, 42, 91 - 98. – The {{occurrence}} of hide damage light flecks <b>and</b> <b>spots</b> was determined on tanned hides from 28 herds during a period of 8 to 12 months. Light flecks <b>and</b> <b>spots</b> are described as small areas of grain loss up to 3 mm in diameter that are seen on dyed crust cattle leather. Damage was found on 75. 8 % of all hides. The neck and shoulders were the anatomical region with the highest prevalence of damage. Sixty-eight per cent of all hides had light flecks <b>and</b> <b>spots</b> in this region. The forelimbs and dewlap were the anatomical region with the second highest occurrence with a prevalence of 39. 1 %. This distribution corresponded to the known distribution of lice in cattle. No significant differences were observed in age, sex, prevalence of lice in the herd assessed in March or infestations with different lice species. The frequency of light flecks <b>and</b> <b>spots</b> varied significantly during the year. The frequency was highest in the late winter and early spring, decreased significantly during the summer and was lowest in the autumn. This variation supported the importance of lice in the development of light flecks <b>and</b> <b>spots</b> <b>and</b> suggested a relatively long healing period for the damages induced by lice. leather; damage; lice...|$|R

The aircraft continued their patrol <b>and</b> <b>spotted</b> five large merchant ships in the Nord Gulen and two minesweepers and a flak ship near Bremanger.

5|$|Common elands {{communicate}} via gestures, vocalizations, scent cues {{and display}} behaviors. The flehmen response also occurs, primarily in males {{in response to}} contact with female urine or genitals. Females will urinate to indicate fertility during the appropriate phase of their estrous cycle, {{as well as to}} indicate their lack of fertility when harassed by males. If eland bulls find any of their predators nearby, they will bark and attempt {{to attract the attention of}} others by trotting back and forth until the entire herd is conscious of the danger. Some of their main predators include lions, African wild dogs, cheetahs <b>and</b> <b>spotted</b> hyenas. Juvenile elands are more vulnerable than adults to their predators.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} 1868–1876, Sitting Bull {{developed}} {{into the most}} important of Native American political leaders. After the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) and the creation of the Great Sioux Reservation, many traditional Sioux warriors, such as Red Cloud of the Oglala <b>and</b> <b>Spotted</b> Tail of the Brulé, moved to reside permanently on the reservations. They were largely dependent for subsistence on the US Indian agencies. Many other chiefs, including members of Sitting Bull's Hunkpapa band such as Gall, at times lived temporarily at the agencies. They needed the supplies at a time when white encroachment and the depletion of buffalo herds reduced their resources and challenged Native American independence.|$|E
5|$|Located in the Northern Rockies, Missoula has {{a typical}} Rocky Mountain ecology. Local {{wildlife}} includes populations of white-tailed deer, black bears, osprey, and bald eagles. During the winter, rapid snowmelt on Mount Jumbo {{due to its}} steep slope leaves grass available for grazing elk and mule deer. The rivers around Missoula provide nesting habitats for bank swallows, northern rough-winged swallows and belted kingfishers. Killdeer <b>and</b> <b>spotted</b> sandpipers can be seen foraging for insects along the gravel bars. Other species include song sparrows, catbirds, several species of warblers, and the pileated woodpecker. The rivers also provide cold, clean water for native fish such as westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. The meandering streams also attract beaver and wood ducks. The parks also host a variety of snakes such as racers, garter snakes, and rubber boa.|$|E

5|$|Mortality is {{high for}} eggs and hatchlings, and nests face threats from floods, overheating, and predators. Flooding {{is a major}} cause of failure of {{crocodilians}} to breed successfully, as nests are submerged, developing embryos are deprived of oxygen, and juveniles get washed away. One of the chief predators of alligators' eggs in Florida is the raccoon, which is attracted by olfactory cues after the nest has been disturbed by turtles. The Florida black bear also raids alligator eggs. In Africa, mongooses, honey badgers, baboons, otters, warthogs, bushpigs, <b>and</b> <b>spotted</b> hyenas are all fond of crocodile eggs, but the monitor lizard is thought {{to be the most important}} nest raider. This lizard is also a major hazard in Asia, where other egg predators include civets, mongooses, rats, sloth bears, jackals, and dogs.|$|E

However, Long's disciples were unaware that he had been arrested and continued with their plot. After nightfall on March 23, the bombs were taken into Saigon and placed at strategic points, with proclamation notices being erected in close proximity. None of the bombs successfully detonated. One source says that the bombs failed because the French authorities had defused all of them after uncovering the conspiracy.|$|E
