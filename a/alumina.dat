The catalytic activity of these <b>aluminas</b> in the epoxidation of cis-cyclooctene with aqueous 70 wt% hydrogen peroxide shows, after 24 h, a profile with two maxima at 400 and 700 [*]°C that corresponds to 85 and 80 % yield, respectively.

The <b>aluminas</b> from the γ-series show the highest cyclooctene oxide yield after 1 h; however, due to surface modifications occurring during the reaction, the <b>aluminas</b> from the δ-series also give good yields after 24 h. The water adsorption capacity or hydrophilicity of these <b>aluminas</b> shows a strong correlation with epoxide productivity of the calcined <b>aluminas</b> at 24 h. Generally, better epoxide productivity is observed for lower hydrophilicities. The hydrogen peroxide efficiencies are typically 2. 0 – 2. 5 mmol of oxidant per mmol of epoxide formed after 24 h.

This review focuses on the individual synthesis routes to produce organized mesoporous <b>aluminas</b> with large surface areas and narrow pore size distributions, and on the evaluation of their textural, chemical and thermal properties and outlines examples of catalytic applications of organized mesoporous alumina-based catalysts. We tried to rationalize the synthetic approaches to prepare organized mesoporous <b>aluminas,</b> to relate their properties to synthetic procedures used as well as to their catalytic behavior in different reactions. Utilization of various structure-directing agents for “cationic,” “neutral,” “anionic,” “nanocasting,” and special approaches leading to scaffolding and lathlike organized mesoporous <b>aluminas</b> is discussed {{in the first part of}} this review, as well as textural and structural characterization and thermal stability of mesoporous <b>aluminas</b> synthesized by different synthetic approaches.

In this sense samarium was the first chemical element to be named after a person.

At a typical feed concentration of 50 ppm, about 15 % of the contained gallium is extractable. The remainder reports to the red mud and aluminium hydroxide streams. Gallium is removed from the ion-exchange resin in solution. Electrolysis then gives gallium metal. For semiconductor use, it is further purified with zone melting or single-crystal extraction from a melt (Czochralski process).
