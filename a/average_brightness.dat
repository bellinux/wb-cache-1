25|$|The {{broadcast}} or {{transport channel}} for TV {{in countries that}} use NTSC or ATSC has a bandwidth of 6MHz. To conserve bandwidth, SSB would be desirable, but the video signal has significant low-frequency content (<b>average</b> <b>brightness)</b> and has rectangular synchronising pulses. The engineering compromise is vestigial-sideband transmission. In vestigial sideband, the full upper sideband of bandwidth W2 = 4.75MHz is transmitted, but only W1 = 1.25MHz of the lower sideband is transmitted, along with a carrier. This effectively makes the system AM at low modulation frequencies and SSB at high modulation frequencies. The absence of the lower sideband components at high frequencies must be compensated for, and this {{is done by the}} RF and IF filters.|$|E

In this paper, we present the optical V, R, and I photometric observations done with the 1. 56 m telescope at the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory from 2000 to 2008. Our monitoring results show 1118 sets of observations (258 sets for the V band, 414 sets for the R band, and 446 sets for the I band). The observations indicate that (1) the variations in the three bands are Delta V = 1. 363 +/- 0. 088 mag from V = 12. 204 +/- 0. 062 to V = 13. 567 +/- 0. 062, Delta R = 1. 299 +/- 0. 023 mag from R = 12. 014 +/- 0. 014 to R = 13. 313 +/- 0. 013, and Delta I = 1. 041 +/- 0. 088 mag from I = 11. 628 +/- 0. 046 to I = 12. 669 +/- 0. 075.

40|$|GFP neutral-anionic {{switching}} {{versus the}} glass hydration. The fluorescence {{properties of the}} GFPmut 2 protein depend on the protonation state of the chromophore that can exist in a neutral, anionic or a zwitterionic form [1]. A reversible loss of fluorescence, with characteristic times {{in the range of}} 100 ms – 1 s, is ascribed to the anionic-zwitterionic transition of the chromophore. This process has been resolved in the experiment reported in the Ms (see Fig. 1 C in the Ms.). Actually the <b>average</b> molecular <b>brightness</b> of each protein was computed by skipping the short-living dark states. The transition between the anionic and the neutral state (A-N switching) corresponds to a reversible fluorescence shift from the blue emission band to the green emission band.
