50|$|Xerocoles {{are usually}} light and sandy in color {{as a means}} to reflect solar {{radiation}} <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> absorption. Some change color with the seasons to reflect more sunlight in the summer: addaxes change from gray-brown to nearly white. Iguanid lizards can change color on a much smaller time scale by varying melanin concentration.

All L lenses are supplied complete with a hood and pouch, which are not included with non-L lenses. Distinctive visual cues include a red ring around the lens and an off-white colour on longer-focal-length models.

5000|$|In its {{capacity}} to remove body heat the bill is {{comparable to that of}} elephant ears. The ability to radiate heat depends upon air speed: if this is low only 25% of the adult bird's resting heat production to as much as four times this heat production. In comparison, the bill of a duck and the ears of elephant can shed only 9 to 9.1% of resting heat production. The bill normally is responsible for 30 to 60% of heat loss. The practice of toco toucans of placing their bills under their wings may serve to insulate the bill <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> loss during sleep.

5000|$|Jerboas are {{adapted to}} live in deserts {{therefore}} are called xerocole animals. They are nocturnal and {{spend most of their}} day burrowed under sand to avoid the heat. [...] Burrowing under the sand, they evade the heat from the sun, minimizing water loss and avoiding dehydration. By decreasing activity during the day they require less water intake. The jerboas build large burrow systems, underground tunnels, to stay in during the day. These underground burrows have a higher moisture concentration than at the surface level and help reduce body water loss. Specific species of jerboas plug burrow entrances with soil to retain moisture and keep hot air from entering burrows. The pelt of the jerboa is usually light and sandy in color to reflect heat from the sun <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> absorption.|$|E

The second floor accommodated the main galleried lecture theatre, museum, two laboratories and associated support rooms. An animal house stood on the flat roof to the west. Consideration {{had been given to}} the provision of services and use of suitable materials to facilitate the effective operation of {{the building}}. All windows except those on the south-east were glazed with anti-actinic glass of a soft bluish-green to counteract the glare <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> transmission. Other services and fittings included sound-proofing, ventilating systems, refrigeration, stainless steel and chromium-plated fittings, and specialised electrical and drainage systems.

5000|$|More recently, kaolin {{mixed with}} {{spreaders}} and stickers {{and applied to}} plants as a spray at 1-6% concentration in water form {{has been shown to}} be an effective approach to agricultural pest control and to protect plants from environmental stresses. Kaolin-based sprays have been studied extensively since 1999 and research has established that these sprays deposit a [...] "particle film" [...] that has numerous beneficial effects on plants and in insect pest control. Certain kaolin-based sprays can form a highly reflective white film over plant surfaces that is known to enhance plant photosynthesis <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> stress in plants by reflecting the infra-red light spectrum which in the end improves plant yields and fruit quality in orchards,. The kaolin barrier created by the particle film also protects the treated plant surfaces from diseases, and insects,. Commercial forms of kaolin-based particle films are currently used in the western United States to control pear pests and to protect apples from sunburn damage. Kaolin sprays are also used internationally for specific insect pests and sunburn problems in apples, pear, citrus, pomegranates, and vegetables. Kaolin is generally regarded as safe to humans and has long history of use in the paint, plastics, pharmaceutical and paper industry. Kaolin sprays are used for pest control and sunburn protection in both conventional and organic food production in the United States and abroad.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFor {{historic}} buildings, {{where an}} alteration of the exterior façade is not wanted, interior insulation {{can be the}} solution to improve the indoor climate <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> loss, but might also introduce moisture problems like condensation in the wall.

40|$|Current ASAE {{standards}} {{of heat and}} moisture production are based primarily on data collected nearly four decades ago. Feedstuffs, swine practices, growth rate, and lean percentage have changed considerably in that time period and have a substantial effect on both heat and moisture production. In fact, recent {{research has shown that}} high-lean gain swine are more susceptible to high environmental temperatures – partially due to increased heat production. This increase in heat production cannot be met physiologically through increased sensible heat loss (i. e. surface area); therefore, latent heat loss must increase. Furthermore, synthetic amino acids can more closely match diet composition with swine nutrient requirements, <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> production and nitrogen loss. This paper reviews the genetic, nutritional, and environmental effects on heat and moisture production of growing-finishing swine, and identifies the areas that need further investigation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{effectiveness}} and economic feasibility of cooling the gas-turbine's inlet-air by air washing (AW) compared to wetted-media evaporative cooling (WMEC) {{in the hot}} and dry climatic conditions of Sudan. Measurements were made on an experimental test rig to determine the cooling effect of the WMEV and that of AW with water at ambient temperature and with chilled water. Taken at two seasons of the year with different ambient temperature and humidity levels, the experimental results were used to estimate the revenues that the systems can generate {{as a result of}} increased megawatts <b>and</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>heat</b> rate of a typical gas turbine model (GE PG 6581 B). The calculations indicate that the WMEC system can increase the gas turbine output by 12 % <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> its <b>heat</b> rate by 1. 6 %. Using un-chilled water, the AW system can increase the output by 16. 7 % <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> the <b>heat</b> rate by 2. 2 %, while with chilled water it can increase the power by 23. 3 % <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> the <b>heat</b> rate by 3. 1 %. Based on these estimates, the WMEC system requires a payback period of 8 months if run for 4 hours daily, which reduces to 4 months if used for 8 hours. AW with un-chilled water has a payback period of about 8 months, but the pay-back period for the chilled-water AW system is about 5 years...|$|R
30|$|In {{regard to}} scaling {{up of the}} process, the {{self-heating}} pasteurization technique should be further studied (Sánchez et al. 2016). If conditions are improved, the duration of treatment may be reduced. Also, optimizing aeration would facilitate removal of the mass <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> loss during turning. The technique used in this work is suitable for small growers because a crate of 1  m 3 can process about 220  kg of grass or 380  kg corncobs with 65 % moisture. If processing a larger amount of substrate is required, {{it would be possible}} to increase the volume of the container. However, the question rises to what extent it would be feasible, referring to the traditional technique of two phases. The larger the mass, the greater the heat generated, but also the greater the effort required to obtain a uniform temperature throughout the whole substrate, and also the greater the difficulties to moisten the substrate homogeneously.|$|E
40|$|The Emmaboda HT-BTES {{was taken}} into {{operation}} 2010. Since then ~ 10 GWh has been stored, only a fraction has been extracted, and a storage temperature of 40 - 45 oC has been reached. The purpose of the BTES is to utilize waste heat from the industrial processes. Heat sources have been added annually and in 2015 the predicted heat injection (3. 6 GWh/year) will be reached. Performed simulations are based on actual heat injection and extraction. The simulation model can reasonably well predict the future operation of the BTES. Initial problems with circulating the heat carrier at a slight vacuum pressure have been solved by using vacuum pumps to degas the fluid. The BTES has reduced the amount of bought district heating by approximately 4 GWh/year. To improve the system further, <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> losses, {{it is suggested that}} a heat pump should be installed for heat extraction. Godkänd; 2014; 20151204 (bon...|$|E
