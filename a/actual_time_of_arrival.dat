40|$|Introduction: Mobilization {{of trauma}} {{resources}} {{has the potential}} to cause ripple effects throughout hospital operations. One major factor affecting efficient utilization of trauma resources is a discrepancy between the prehospital estimated time of arrival (ETA) as communicated by emergency medical services (EMS) personnel and their <b>actual</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> (TOA). The current study aimed to assess the accuracy of the perceived prehospital estimated arrival time by EMS personnel in comparison to their actual arrival time at a Level II trauma center in San Bernardino County, California. Methods: This retrospective study included traumas classified as alerts or activations that were transported to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in 2013. We obtained estimated arrival time and actual arrival time for each transport from the Surgery Department Trauma Registry. The difference between the median of ETA and actual TOA by EMS crews to the trauma center was calculated for these transports. Additional variables assessed included time of day and month during which the transport took place. Results: A total of 2, 454 patients classified as traumas were identified in the Surgery Department Trauma Registry. After exclusion of trauma consults, walk-ins, handoffs between agencies, downgraded traumas, traumas missing information, and traumas transported by agencies other than American Medical Response, Ontario Fire, Rialto Fire or San Bernardino County Fire, we included a final sample size of 555 alert and activation classified traumas in the final analysis. When combining all transports by the included EMS agencies, the median of the ETA was 10 minutes and the median of the actual TOA was 22 minutes (median of difference= 9 minutes, p< 0. 0001). Furthermore, when comparing the difference between trauma alerts and activations, trauma activations demonstrated an equal or larger difference in the median of the estimated and <b>actual</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> (p< 0. 0001). We also found month and time of day to be associated with variability in the difference between the median of the estimated and actual arrival time (p= 0. 0082 and p= 0. 0005 for month and time of the day, respectively). Conclusion: EMS personnel underestimate their travel time by a median of nine minutes, which may cause the trauma team to abandon other important activities in order to respond to the emergency department prematurely. The discrepancy between ETA and TOA is unpredictable, varying by month and time of day. As such, a better method of estimating patient arrival time is needed.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} issues in Transhipment Container Terminal (TCT) management is to have fairly reliable and affordable predictions about vessel arrival. Terminal operators need to estimate the <b>actual</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> in port {{in order to determine the}} daily demand for each work shift with greater accuracy. In this way, the resources required (human resources, equipment as well as spatial resources) can be allocated more efficiently. Despite contractual obligations to notify the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) 24 hours before arrival, ship operators often have to revise it due to unexpected events like weather conditions, delay in a previous port and so on. For planners the decision-making processes related to this topic can sometimes be so complex without the support of suitable methodological tools. Specific models should be adopted, in a daily planning scenario, to provide a useful support tool in TCTs. In this study, we discuss an exploratory analysis of the data affecting delays registered at a Mediterranean TCT. We present some preliminary results obtained using data mining techniques and propose a Classification and Regression Trees (CART) model to reduce the range of uncertainty of ship arrivals in port. This approach is compulsory to manage vast amounts of unstructured data involved in estimating of vessel arrivals...|$|E
40|$|This work is two pronged, {{discussing}} 1) the morphology of contrails {{and their}} transition to cirrus uncinus, and 2) their microphysical and radiative properties. It {{is based upon}} the fortuitous occurrence of an unusual set of essentially parallel contrails and the unanticipated availability of nearly simultaneous observations by photography, satellite, automated ground-based lidar, and a newly available database of aircraft flight tracks. The contrails, oriented from the northeast to southwest, are carried to the southeast with a com-ponent of the wind so that they are spread from the northwest to southeast. Convective turrets form along each contrail to form the cirrus uncinus with fallstreaks of ice crystals that are oriented essentially normal to the contrail length. Each contrail is observed sequentially by the lidar and tracked backward to the time and position of the originating aircraft track with the appropriate component of the wind. The correlation coefficient between predicted and <b>actual</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> at the lidar is 0. 99, so that one may identify both visually and satellite-observed contrails exactly. Contrails generated earlier in the westernmost flight cor-ridor occasionally arrive simultaneously with those formed later closer to the lidar to produce broader cirrus fallstreaks and overlapping contrails on the satellite image. The minimum age of a contrail is 2 h and corresponds to the longest time of travel to the lidar. The lag between the initial formation of the contrai...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—“What {{would have}} happened, had I taken the {{alternative}} route? ” This {{is a question}} that many drivers often ponder, hoping that their chosen route is the best. This paper proposes DoppelDriver, a system that attempts to answer such questions on non-chosen alternative routes to a given destination by determining <b>actual</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> (ATAs) from participatory users on the non-chosen routes. DoppelDriver offers a direct, <b>actual</b> travel <b>time</b> comparison among route choices. With DoppelDriver’s collection <b>of</b> <b>actual</b> travel <b>time</b> comparisons, users {{will be able to make}} strategic decisions on, and self-assessments of, their route choices. Also, we describe the potential usage and benefits of ex-post feedback (i. e. travel time on non-chosen routes) and how snapshots <b>of</b> travel <b>time</b> comparisons can be used to support strategic decision making on the choice of a route. Using real taxi GPS data, we investigate whether aggregating ATAs for road segments from other users mimics the ATA for the intended origin-to-destination route. Finally, we present our system design for a prototype implemented on the Android platform.

40|$|Best Paper of Session & 2 nd Place Best Graduate Student PaperThe North Atlantic oceanic {{airspace}} (NAT) joins two highly populated continents - North America and Europe. Air traffic in NAT mainly contributes to two major flows: the westbound flow departing from Europe in the morning, and the eastbound flow departing from North America in the evening. Each of these flows consists {{of more than}} 500 aircraft daily. Aircraft within NAT experience strong winds caused by the Jet Streams (JSs). JSs are fast narrow air currents mainly located in the upper troposphere and generally moving in eastern direction. The JS speed is typically 100 kts (nautical miles per hour) but can reach 200 kts. Thus, the eastbound flights would try to exploit the JS in order to benefit from strong tailwinds, while the westbound flights would avoid the JS {{in order to minimize}} head-wind. As a result, the NAT is highly congested at peak hours. Standard radar-based surveillance is not available for most part of NAT. To perform the Air Traffic Control and assure the en-route aircraft separation, the Organized Track System (OTS) was established in NAT. The OTS consists of several quasi-parallel tracks each of which represents a sequence of great circles joining successive significant waypoints (WPs). In vertical direction each track consists of several flight levels. The longitudinal (in-track) separation in NAT is assessed in terms of differences in <b>actual</b> and estimated <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> at common WPs; and expressed in clock minutes. Current regulations impose large separation minima for aircraft on OTS...|$|R
40|$|Target {{tracking}} using <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> measurements {{belongs to}} the primary taskssolved within radar signal processing. In this paper, the Taylor series-based trackingalgorithm that uses <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> measurements for through wall tracking of the movingtarget is introduced. The proposed algorithm {{is derived from the}} Taylor series methodapplied for target localization. In contrast to the Taylor series method, the Taylor seriesbasedtracking algorithm exploits for target positioning not only <b>actual</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> arrivalmeasurements, but also the target position estimated in the previous time instant. In orderto improve the tracking ability of the proposed algorithm, a suitable weighting of the inputdata of the algorithm is applied. The performance of the Taylor series-based trackingalgorithm will be compared with the performance of the direct calculation method andlinear Kalman filtering. For that purpose, two real scenarios of through wall tracking of amoving person will be analysed. The obtained results will show very clearly that the newTaylor series based tracking algorithm introduced in this paper can provide the betterestimate of the target trajectory than the other tested localization and tracking algorithms...|$|R
40|$|A {{container}} terminal {{is a complex}} system where {{a broad range of}} operations are carried out involving a wide array of resources that need to interact over a 24 hour operating cycle. Since the various activities are mutually related to each other, there is a need not only to maximise the efficiency of each one, but also to ensure proper coordination, hence to solve integrated decision-making problems. Several factors can affect the quality of the services provided and the overall efficiency. Vessel arrival uncertainty further complicates the task of the planners and, as a result, of the effectiveness of the planning itself, in particular at the operational level. Each arrival produces high peak loads for other terminal activities, {{as well as for the}} supporting arrival activities (pilotage, towage, etc.) and hinterland transportation (waiting, congestion etc.). Deviating arrivals only worsen this peak load. On a daily level, the <b>actual</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> of the vessels often deviates from the scheduled time. Despite contractual obligations to notify the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) at least 24 hours before the arrival, ship operators often have to adapt and update the latest ETA due to unexpected circumstances. This aspect results in a last-minute change of plans in terminal operations resulting in higher costs. In fact, the ability to predict the actual time of a vessel’s arrival in a port 24 hours in advance is fundamental for the related planning activities for which the decision-making processes need to be constantly adapted and updated. Moreover, disruptions in container flows and operations caused by vessel arrival uncertainty can have cascade effects within the overall supply chain and network within which the port is part. Although vessel arrival uncertainty in ports is a well-known problem for the scientific community, the literature review highlights that in the maritime sector the specific instruments for dealing with this problem are extremely limited. The absence of a reference model that specifies the relationship between vessel arrival uncertainty and the involved variables resulted in the application of a specific machine learning approach within the Knowledge Discovery in Database process. This V approach, that abandons all prior assumptions about data distribution shape, is based on the self-learning concept according to which the relation between an outcome variable Y and the set of predictors X is directly identified from the historical collected data. The approach has been validated thanks to two different case studies: the {{container terminal}} of Cagliari, located in the Mediterranean basin, and one of the main container terminals of Antwerp, located at the North Sea. Depending on the framework and planning purposes several estimates can provide useful information on vessel arrivals. Sometimes, it can be useful for planners to infer a quantitative estimate of the delay/advance in minutes, sometimes it may be useful to have a qualitative estimate, even only knowing whether or not an incoming vessel is likely to arrive before or after the scheduled ETA. For this reason a two-step instrument is proposed is made up of two different modules. The fitted algorithmic models used to obtain predictions are Logistic Regression, CART (Classification and Regression Trees) and Random Forest. All the proposed models are able to learn from experience, following the well-known Data Mining paradigm “learning from data”. From a practical point of view, the probability, associated to the continuous estimation, of specifically identifying the work-shift of the incoming vessel is calculated. In all predictions Random Forest algorithms still show the best performance. This aspect can help planners, in the daily strategy decision making process, in order to improve the use of the human, mechanical and spatial resources required for handling operations. This could maximise terminal efficiency and minimise terminal costs, hence improving terminal competitiveness. Moreover, the interpretation of the discovered knowledge, made it possible to evaluate the most discriminating variables of the analysis, even thanks to graphical visualisation of the Importance-plots. ...|$|E
