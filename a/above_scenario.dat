2500|$|In two 2005 {{scientific}} papers, Eberth, Getty, and Currie formulated {{a hypothesis}} {{for the formation}} of the centrosaur bonebeds of Dinosaur Provincial Park. They envisioned common flooding events drowning large numbers of local wildlife, including herds of Centrosaurus and Styracosaurus. Flowing water would distribute these remains across the local floodplain, where they would be buried by later floods. Burial was not always permanent as some remains seem to have been uncovered again by later flood activity only to be buried again by yet more later floods. The process of reworking and reburial might have occurred over decades or millennia before the remains were buried for good in their final resting place, which was often in deposits left by channels of flowing water. Eberth, Brinkman, and Barkas thought that the <b>above</b> <b>scenario</b> [...] "appl particularly well" [...] so the Hilda bonebeds formed as a result of similar processes to those of Dinosaur Provincial Park.|$|E
2500|$|Laade's picture (1968) of Australian and Papuan {{settlement}} in Torres Strait supports the <b>above</b> <b>scenario</b> of Papuan and Austronesian speakers who shifted to an Australian language {{over a long}} period of time, the Austronesians being culturally a superstratum, however not in a position to impose their language. He presented folk history evidence that a few Austronesian traders (men) settled at Parema (north-east of Daru) and married local [...] women. To avoid further miscegenation, they soon moved and settled in Torres Strait, first to the Eastern Islands, then to the Central Islands, then to Moa, Badu and Mabuiag. At Mabuiag, Badu and Moa they found Aboriginal people, killed the men and kept the women (and presumably the children). Some moved on up to Saibai, Dœwan and Bœigu to avoid this new miscegenation, hence the lighter colour of many Saibai, Dœwan and Bœigu people. Bœigu folk history collected by Laade also shows direct East Austronesian genetic influence on Bœigu.|$|E

50|$|This {{stands in}} stark {{contrast}} to the implications of the Copenhagen interpretation, according to which, although the survival outcome is possible in every iteration, its probability tends towards zero as the number of iterations increases.

5000|$|Complications arise, however, {{from the}} fact that the justice {{community}} does not utilize a standard, common vocabulary when describing and recording events. Differences in terminologies can make it difficult or impossible for shared data to be interpreted and utilized.

5000|$|An option {{contract}} can provide some {{security to the}} promisee in the <b>above</b> <b>scenario.</b> [...] Essentially, once a promisee begins performance, an {{option contract}} is implicitly created between the promisor and the promisee. The promisor impliedly promises not to revoke the offer and the promisee impliedly promises to furnish complete performance, but as the name suggests, the promisee still retains the [...] "option" [...] of not completing performance. The consideration for this option contract is discussed in comment d of the above cited section. Basically, the consideration {{is provided by the}} promisee's beginning of performance.|$|E
50|$|For a fully amortizing loan, with a fixed (i.e., non-variable) {{interest}} rate, {{the payment}} {{remains the same}} throughout the term, regardless of principal balance owed. For example, the payment on the <b>above</b> <b>scenario</b> will remain $733.76 {{regardless of whether the}} outstanding (unpaid) principal balance is $100,000 or $50,000. Paying down more than the monthly contractual amount reduces the amount outstanding and thus the interest that is payable to the lender; if the contractual monthly payment stays the same, the number of payments and the term of the loan must decrease. Conversely, paying down less than the monthly contractual amount increases the amount outstanding and thus the interest payable (negative amortization); if the contractual monthly payment stays the same, the number of payments and the term of the loan must increase.|$|E
30|$|Notice {{that if the}} <b>above</b> <b>scenarios</b> are merged, {{the result}} is a {{collective}} behavior that supports a common goal, i.e. enabling two people to talk. This complies with our objective of modeling SoS using pcb-statecharts. Indeed, when the SoS goal is defined, candidate systems can be modeled separately, interactions can be designed to support collective behaviors, and the whole SoS operation can still be described by merging individual behaviors.|$|R

Therefore, it can uniquely identify the 2 D transmit/receive angles of multiple closely spaced targets with high-resolution. However, traditional methods only contain angle parameter estimation without polarization information, leading to their performance degradation in locating multiple closely spaced targets.|$|R
5000|$|Michael Tye {{characterizes the}} absent qualia {{hypothesis}} as, [...] "the hypothesis {{that it could}} be the case that a system that functionally duplicates the mental states of a normal human being has no phenomenal consciousness (no qualia)." [...] This is to say that, if I were to create a machine which could exactly duplicate the <b>above</b> <b>scenario,</b> a machine which contained a computer system as complicated as John's neurological system, then it is logically possible that this system would have exactly the same reaction as John but lack consciousness, a prerequisite for subjective experience (qualia). A supporter of Functionalism would go on to argue how it must be the case that qualia would not be created in a duplicated scenario, thus demonstrating that qualia cannot exist without conflicting with the fundamental tenets of Functionalism.|$|E

When it is an A day, for example, a student may go to his/her cycle class. When it is a B day, the student will go to his/her Physical Education/Health class. The days go on an alternating bases. If yesterday was an A day, then today is a B day, and tomorrow is another A day. If school is closed because of inclement weather, then the day count continues. For example, if yesterday was an A day, then today should be a B day. However, {{we did not have}} school today because of snow. The following day, the day is another A day. The snow day counted as the B day, even though no one was in school. Holidays and breaks do not count, so in the <b>above</b> <b>scenario</b> (replacing snow day with a holiday), the following day would be a B day.|$|E
