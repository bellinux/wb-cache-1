40|$|The final {{quality of}} steel strip is {{significantly}} {{affected by the}} first forming operations. Strip defects caused {{at this early stage}} are difficult or even impossible to remove in downstream lines, and may lead to a reduction of output figures {{as a result of their}} interference with forming and other subsequent processes. This work examined the formation of the so-called camber - the curvature of the strip in the strip plane - during the roughing process, which represents the first forming process in flat steel production. Inextricably linked with the camber phenomenon is the formation of an <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> (thickness wedge). The purpose of this work was to gain knowledge about the optimization potential of the roughing process in order to obtain a strip geometry with a maximum freedom from camber and thickness wedge formation. A great number of effects on camber formation is already known and has been described in the relevant literature. What has so far not been examined in detail is the edging effect frequently observed in the industrial practice. For that reason, initial laboratory tests were conducted to determine possible camber-affecting criteria in connection with the edging process. Three particular factors could be identified: different diameters of edging rolls, off-centre position of specimens and oblique head and tail ends of the strip resulted in a camber formation as early as during the edging process or after the subsequent horizontal rolling pass. Varying roughness values of edging rolls did not produce any camber. The main purpose of further tests was to examine the regeneration of a straight form without any camber and thickness wedge. To begin with, wedge-free specimens were rolled to a camber shape with tilted rolls. A restoration of the specimen's original straight shape was attempted a) by tilting the rolls in the opposite direction, b) by an only minor tilting of rolls and c) by their adjustment to a straight position. Test results proved that the straight, non-camber and wedge-free shape could be restored after the third rolling pass with only slightly tilted rolls. In addition to straight initial specimens rolled with tilted rolls, specimens with thickness wedges were rolled with straight rolls. The significant camber formation as a result of the <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> may be prevented by tilting the rolls according to the initial thickness wedge. This roll adjustment, however, does not cause a reduction of the thickness wedge. The rolled product exhibits either a camber or a thickness wedge or both defects. To obtain a straight specimen, an additional control element besides the tilting of rolls is required. For this reason, tests were conducted by using side guides. The positive effect of side guides on the strip form is frequently observed in the industrial practice. A comparison of specimens rolled with and without side guides proved that a reduction of both camber and thickness wedge can be achieved by using side guides during the rolling process. The thickness wedge was in part equalized as a result of an asymmetrical spread at both sides of the stand. In addition to laboratory tests, industrial process data were evaluated and analyzed by using data recorded by a strip form measuring system installed at the roughing train of the EKO-Stahl hot-rolling mill. This system measures the position of strip edges at both sides of the stand and at two points each in the entry and exit area of the stand. These data were used to determine the curvature of the strip, which provides a precise information about the size and direction of the strip camber. This calculation allows an online conclusion as to the strip camber at any point along the strip length. The curvature and all other relevant process data of EKO-Stahl were collected in a data base and were analyzed with regard to the strip camber, with various data-based methods being used to determine and evaluate the influential factors of the strip camber. This evaluation and the relevant test results were used to select the input variables of a data-based modelling for a pre-calculation of the strip curvature by means of the neural network technique. The obtained correlation factors between the curvature data determined on the basis of measured edge position data and those calculated by means of the model amount to 0. 7 - 0. 8 in the validation. In conclusion, a procedure for preventing camber and thickness wedge formation during hot roughing was elaborated and submitted to the German Patent Office. This procedure could allow the production of a straight form free from camber and thickness wedge formation for straight slabs as well as for slabs with a thickness wedge. A proposal for the control of the roughing process on the basis of this procedure is included...|$|E

40|$|Rotating disks {{have many}} {{applications}} in the aerospace industry such as gas turbines and gears. These disks normally work under thermo mechanical loads. Minimizing the weight of such components can help reduce the overall payload in aerospace industry. For this purpose, a rotating functionally graded (FG) disk with variable thickness under a steady temperature field is considered in this paper. Thermo elastic solutions {{and the weight of}} the disk are related to the material grading index and the geometry of the disk. It is found that a disk with parabolic or hyperbolic convergent <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> has smaller stresses and displacements compared to a uniform thickness disk. Maximum radial stress due to centrifugal load in the solid disk with parabolic <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> may not be at the center unlike uniform thickness disk. Functionally graded disk with variable thickness has smaller stresses due to thermal load compared to those with uniform thickness. It is seen that for a given value of grading index, the FG disk having concave <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> is the lightest in weight whereas the FG disk with uniform <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> is the heaviest. Also for any given <b>thickness</b> <b>profile,</b> the weight of the FG disk lies in between the weights of the all-metal and the all-ceramic disks...|$|R

40|$|Mathematical {{model has}} been {{developed}} to investigate steady state creep in a variable thickness rotating disc made of functionally graded Al-SiCp. The SiCp content in the disc is assumed to decrease from the inner to outer radius. The creep behavior of the disc material is described by threshold stress based law with a stress exponent of 5. The stresses and strain rates in the disc are estimated by solving creep constitutive equations along with the equilibrium equation for a rotating disc. The stresses and strain rates have been estimated for similar FGM discs with three different <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> i. e. constant thickness, linearly varying thickness and hyperbolic varying thickness. The FGM disc having hyperbolic <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> exhibits the lowest stresses and strain rates compared linear or constant thickness disc. The tangential and radial strain rates in FGM discs with linear and hyperbolic <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> are respectively lower by about two and three orders of magnitude when compared to a constant thickness FGM disc.

40|$|Purpose: To {{characterize}} the epithelial, stromal, and total corneal <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> {{in a population}} of eyes with keratoconus. Methods: Epithelial, stromal, and total corneal <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> were measured in vivo by Artemis very high-frequency (VHF) digital ultrasound scanning (ArcScan) across the central 6 - to 10 -mm diameter of the cornea on 54 keratoconic eyes. Maps of the average, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and range of epithelial, stromal, and total corneal thickness were plotted. The average location of the thinnest epithelium, stroma, and total cornea were found. The crosssectional semi-meridional stromal and total corneal <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> were calculated using annular averaging. The absolute stromal and total corneal thickness progressions relative to the thinnest point were calculated using annular averaging {{as well as for}} 8 semi-meridians individually. Results: The mean corneal vertex epithelial, stromal, and total corneal thicknesses were 45. 7 ± 5. 9 μm, 426. 4 ± 38. 5 μm and 472. 2 ± 41. 4 μm respectively. The average epithelial <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> showed an epithelial doughnut pattern characterized by localized central thinning surrounded by an annulus of thick epithelium. The thinnest epithelium, stroma, and total cornea were displaced on average by 0. 48 ± 0. 66 mm temporally and 0. 32 ± 0. 67 mm inferiorly, 0. 31 ± 0. 45 mm temporally and 0. 54 ± 0. 37 mm inferiorly, and 0. 31 ± 0. 43 mm temporally and 0. 50 ± 0. 35 mm inferiorly, respectively, with reference to the corneal vertex.

40|$|In this study, the {{evolution}} of the <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> of UHMW-polyethylene films during sequential biaxial drawing is studied. The basic assumption is that a nonunifonn thickness distribution of the drawn film {{is the result of the}} amplification of initial imperfections. Finite element simulations of the drawing process have been performed in which the drawing of a piece of film with a geometric imperfection is considered. For these numerical simulations, a viscoelastic model is adopted. Although the model does not describe the behavior of UHMW-PE films in full detail, it is able to capture typical features of inhomogeneous deformation. The most striking observation is that severe localization occurs at the beginning of the second drawing step (i. e. in the direction transverse to the first step). In this stage of the drawing process, a localization band develops. These phenomena are also observed in validation experiments. A discrepancy between the simulations and the validation experiments is observed at the end of the drawing process. In the simulations, the deformation is stabilized again, and the resulting <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> is practically uniform.

The <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> of deposited layer {{is a function of}} this distribution. In this work, the coating system is calibrated for the materials which are used and then the parameter of the diffusion distribution function of the particles through the circular aperture is defined by experiments. Using these results, a graph is presented which connects the parameter of the circular aperture to the parameters of the <b>thickness</b> <b>profile.</b> It is then possible to deposit any type of variable reflectivity mirror using this graph. Finally, the effect of the uncertainty in measuring layer thicknesses on the phase of reflected wave and transmitted wave is investigated...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a method}} to control the coating thickness deposited onto large and strongly curved optics by ion beam sputtering. The technique uses an original design of the mask used to screen part of the sputtered materials. A first multi-element mask is calculated from the measured 2 D coating thickness distribution. Then, {{by means of an}} iterative process the final mask is designed. By using such a technique, it has been possible to deposit layers of tantalum pentoxide having a high thickness gradient onto a curved substrate 500 mm in diameter. Residual errors in the coating <b>thickness</b> <b>profile</b> are below 0. 7 %. OCIS codes: 220. 4610, 310. 1860, 310. 0310, 310. 3840. Coating thickness control is a crucial point for interference coatings. Several applications require coating with very good thickness uniformity in order to provide constant optical properties over the optic surface. Others require pre-definite <b>thickness</b> <b>profiles</b> in order to match the coating thickness period with the light incidence angle [1]. Many maskin...|$|R
