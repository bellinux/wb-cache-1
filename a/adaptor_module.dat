A young engineer working for Black, Julie Keahey designed the first VERSAmodule card, the VERSAbus <b>Adaptor</b> <b>Module,</b> used to run existing cards on the new VERSAbus. Sven Rau and Max Loesel of Motorola-Europe added a mechanical specification to the system, basing it on the Eurocard standard that was then late in the standardization process.

In-orbit attitude control was achieved by firing pairs of eight 25 lbf N thrusters located around the circumference of its adapter module at the extreme aft end. Lateral translation control was provided by four 100 lbf N thrusters around the circumference at the forward end of the <b>adaptor</b> <b>module</b> (close to the spacecraft's center of mass). Two forward-pointing 85 lbf N thrusters at the same location, provided aft translation, and two 100 lbf N thrusters located in the aft end of the adapter module provided forward thrust, {{which could be used}} to change the craft's orbit.|$|E

In plants, clathrin-mediated endocytosis is essential for physiology and development, but the identification and organization of the machinery operating this process remains largely obscure.

40|$|Dynamic {{reorganization}} of signaling systems frequently accompany pathway perturbations, yet quantitative studies of network remodeling by pathway stimuli are lacking. Here, we report {{the development of}} a quantitative proteomics platform centered on multiplex Absolute Quantification (AQUA) technology to elucidate the architecture of the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) network and to evaluate current models of dynamic CRL remodeling. Current models suggest that CRL complexes are controlled by cycles of CRL deneddylation and CAND 1 binding. Contrary to expectations, acute CRL inhibition with MLN 4924, an inhibitor of the NEDD 8 -activating enzyme, does not result in a global {{reorganization of}} the CRL network. Examination of CRL complex stoichiometry reveals that, independent of cullin neddylation, a large fraction of cullins are assembled with <b>adaptor</b> <b>modules</b> while only a small fraction are associated with CAND 1. These studies suggest an alternative model of CRL dynamicity where the abundance of <b>adaptor</b> <b>modules,</b> rather than cycles of neddylation and CAND 1 binding, drives CRL network organization...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Traditional common-bus Ethernet LANs {{become very}} {{congested}} due to data collisions {{when the number}} of nodes or traffic flow increases. In this paper we introduce a novel design and implementation of Ethernet called the Reduced Ethernet Switch (RES) and compare its performance with the traditional Ethernet. The main concept involves breaking the common bus into multiple segments which run in parallel with the use of transmission gates. New <b>adaptor</b> <b>modules</b> with a new protocol control these gates. Models and tests of RES and Ethernet are written in Verilog and with Cadence Design Environment tools. The Verilog modules are also synthesized to measure cycle time limitations. The end results show that for heavily loaded networks, RES performs significantly better.

40|$|The SPla/Ryanodine {{receptor}} (SPRY) /B 30. 2 domain {{is one of}} {{the most}} common folds in higher eukaryotes. The human genome encodes 103 SPRY/B 30. 2 domains, several of which are involved in the immune response. Approximately 45 % of human SPRY/B 30. 2 -containing proteins are E 3 ligases. The role and function of the majority of SPRY/B 30. 2 domains are still poorly understood, however, in several cases mutations in this domain have been linked to congenital disorders. The recent characterization of SPRY/B 30. 2 -mediated protein interactions has provided evidence for a role of this domain as an <b>adaptor</b> <b>module</b> to assemble macromolecular complexes, analogous to Src homology (SH) 2, SH 3, and WW domains. However, functional and structural evidence suggests that SPRY/B 30. 2 is a more versatile fold, allowing a wide range of binding modes...|$|E

40|$|Spinal Muscular Atrophy {{results from}} {{loss of the}} {{survival}} of motor neuron (SMN) gene, leading to a deficiency in SMN protein and selective degeneration of motor neurons. We have found that coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM 1) regulates the switch from proliferation to differentiation, downstream of neurotrophic signaling, in motor neuron-like cells. Here, through down-regulation of CARM 1 levels, methylation {{of one of its}} substrates, HuD, is reduced, resulting in an increase in p 21 mRNA. Methylation of HuD by CARM 1 negatively regulates its direct interaction with p 21 mRNA, the first demonstration that CARM 1 can directly influence the RNA binding activity of a substrate. We have also identified a novel interaction between HuD and SMN. In MN- 1 differentiation, we propose that SMN functions as an <b>adaptor</b> <b>module</b> through arginine methylation-regulated interactions with RNA binding proteins, including HuD, and that the formation of distinct mRNP complexes on mRNA are regulated either similarly or differentially by PRMTs and/or SMN. These findings may help to elucidate the specific role of arginine methylation and SMN in regulating differentiation of motor neurons and provide crucial insights into the cell-specific pathophysiology of spinal muscular atrophy...|$|E

40|$|The GLUT 4 -regulating protein, TUG, {{functions}} to retain GLUT 4 -containing membrane vesicles intracellularly and, {{in response to}} insulin stimulation, releases these vesicles to the cellular exocytic machinery for translocation to the plasma membrane. As part of our on going effort to describe the molecular basis for TUG function, we have determined the tertiary structure and characterized the backbone dynamics for an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (TUG–UBL 1) using NMR spectroscopy. A well-ordered conformation is observed for residues 10 – 83 of full-length TUG, and confirms a β-grasp or ubiquitin-like topology. Although not required for in vitro association with GLUT 4, the functional role of the TUG–UBL 1 domain {{has not yet been}} described. We undertook a limited literature review of similar N-terminal UBL domains and noted that a majority participate in protein–protein interactions, generally functioning as <b>adaptor</b> <b>modules</b> to physically associate the over all activity of the protein with a specific cellular process, such as the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. In consistent fashion, TUG–UBL 1 is not expected to participate in a covalent protein modification reaction as it lacks the characteristic C-terminal diglycine (“GG”) motif required for conjugation to an acceptor lysine, and also lacks the three most common acceptor lysine residues involved in polyubiquitination. Additionally, analysis of the TUG–UBL 1 molecular surface reveals a lack of conservation of the “Ile- 44 hydrophobic face” typically involved in ubiquitin recognition. Instead, we speculate on the possible significance of a concentrated area of negative electrostatic potential with increased backbone mobility, both of which are features suggestive of a potential protein–protein interaction site...|$|R

BAR {{and the related}} F-BAR domains form dimeric, crescent-shaped units that occur N- or C-terminally to other lipid-binding, <b>adaptor,</b> or catalytic <b>modules.</b> In crystal structures, the PX-BAR unit of Snx 9 (Snx 9 PX-BAR) adopts an overall compact, moderately curved conformation. SAXS-based solution studies revealed an alternative, more curved state of Snx 9 PX-BAR in which the PX domains are flexibly connected to the BAR domains, providing a model for how Snx 9 exhibits lipid-dependent curvature preferences. In contrast, Endophilin appears to be rigid in solution, and the SH 3 domains are located at the distal tips of a BAR domain dimer with fixed curvature. We also observed tip-to-tip interactions between the BAR domains in a trigonal crystal form of Snx 9 PX-BAR reminiscent of functionally important interactions described for F-BAR domains...|$|R
40|$|Human MRG 15 is a {{transcription}} factor that plays {{a vital role}} in embryonic development, cell proliferation and cellular senescence. It comprises a putative chromo domain in the N-terminal part that has been shown to participate in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. We report here the crystal structure of human MRG 15 chromo domain at 2. 2 Å resolution. The MRG 15 chromo domain consists of a β-barrel and a long α-helix and assumes a structure more similar to the Drosophila MOF chromo barrel domain than the typical HP 1 / Pc chromo domains. The β-barrel core contains a hydrophobic pocket formed by three conserved aromatic residues Tyr 26, Tyr 46 and Trp 49 as a potential binding site for a modified residue of histone tail. However, the binding groove for the histone tail seen in the HP 1 /Pc chromo domains is pre-occupied by an extra β-strand. In vitro binding assay results indicate that the MRG 15 chromo domain can bind to methylated Lys 36, but not methylated Lys 4, Lys 9 and Lys 27 of histone H 3. These data together suggest that the MRG 15 chromo domain may function as an <b>adaptor</b> <b>module</b> which can bind to a modified histone H 3 in a mode {{different from that of the}} HP 1 /Pc chromo domains. © 2006 Oxford University Press. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The FF domain is conserved {{across all}} eukaryotes and usually {{acts as an}} <b>adaptor</b> <b>module</b> in RNA {{metabolism}} and transcription. Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes two FF domain proteins, Prp 40, {{a component of the}} U 1 snRNP, and Ypr 152 c, a protein of unknown function. The structure of Prp 40, its relationship to other proteins within the U 1 snRNP, and its precise function remain little understood. Results Here we have investigated the essentiality and interaction properties of the FF domains of yeast Prp 40. We show that the C-terminal two FF domains of Prp 40 are dispensable. Deletion of additional FF domains is lethal. The first FF domain of Prp 40 binds to U 1 protein Luc 7 in yeast two-hybrid and GST pulldown experiments. FF domains 2 and 3 bind to Snu 71, another known U 1 protein. Peptide array screens identified binding sites for FF 1 - 2 within Snu 71 (NDVHY) and for FF 1 within Luc 7 (ϕ[FHL] × [KR] × [GHL] with ϕ being a hydrophobic amino acid). Conclusion Prp 40, Luc 7, and Snu 71 appear to form a subcomplex within the yeast U 1 snRNP. Our data suggests that the N-terminal FF domains are critical for these interactions. Crystallization of Prp 40, Luc 7, and Snu 71 have failed so far but co-crystallization of pairs or the whole tri-complex may facilitate crystallographic and further functional analysis. </p...|$|E
40|$|Deletions or loss-of-function {{mutations}} in the Survival of Motor Neuron 1 (Smn 1) gene in humans {{is responsible for}} Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), {{one of the leading}} genetic causes of infant mortality. The pathological hallmarks of this disease include the degeneration of lower motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, weakness, paralysis and atrophy of the associated skeletal muscles and eventually of the entire trunk, often times causing respiratory failure and early death during disease progression. Although current knowledge supports the notion that this disease arises from the massive motoneuron loss early in development, mounting evidence suggests that intrinsic muscle defects may also contribute to the pathology. Arginine methylation is also known to be important for normal skeletal muscle differentiation. Since SMN can serve as an <b>adaptor</b> <b>module</b> for arginine methylated proteins, we speculated that SMN will perform its function in skeletal muscle by promoting methyl-dependent interactions. This study has documented a dynamic profile of proteins containing methylated arginines during myoblast differentiation, and that this dynamic profile is dependent on the presence of SMN. Furthermore, I have identified Fibrillarin, a snoRNP component, as one of the methylated proteins that is misregulated in the absence of SMN. Finally, I have also shown that the profile of arginine methylated proteins differs between skeletal muscles from wild type mice and a mouse model of SMA. Taken together, these results represent a novel defect in SMA and provide evidence for the importance of skeletal muscle tissue in this disease...|$|E
40|$|Protein {{interactions}} as {{mediated by}} catalytic or non-catalytic protein domains contribute to cellular signal transduction processes by covalent protein modification of or non-covalent binding to interaction partners. Ena/VASP homology 1 (EVH 1) domains {{are found in}} different signal transduction proteins as N-terminal non-catalytic <b>adaptor</b> <b>modules</b> of ~ 115 amino acids sharing a common fold. By targeting their host proteins to subcellular sites of action {{they are involved in}} several signalling cascades which include protein phosphorylation and cytoskeletal reorganisation. In this study, protein interactions of the two EVH 1 domain containing proteins VASP and Spred 2 were studied according to their involvement in different and non-overlapping signal transduction pathways of the cell. EVH 1 domains were first described in the Ena/VASP protein family with the Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein VASP being its founding member. As a cytoskeleton-associated protein VASP not only interacts with different proteins of the actin network {{but it is also a}} substrate for cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases. However the full complement of protein kinases targeting VASP as their substrate is still unknown. Here we used mouse cardiac fibroblast (MCFB) cells in order to study the phosphorylation status of VASP and identify new candidate protein kinases involved after serum stimulation of these cells. Using phosphosite-specific antibodies we found that serum stimulation induces a phosphorylation of VASP at Ser- 157 in a time-dependent manner reaching its maximum after 90 min of stimulation. We developed an interaction graph model of possible candidate protein kinases involved. Using a pharmacological perturbation analysis with different combinations of specific protein kinase inhibitors and activators we excluded any contribution of cGMP-dependent protein kinase and Rho kinases to this process and identified a combined action of classical isoforms of PKCs and PKA in serum-stimulated VASP phosphorylation at Ser- 157 positioning PKC upstream of PKA in this signalling pathway. We hypothesise that PKC receives an external stimulatory signal upon serum stimulation of MCFB cells which is passed either directly or indirectly to PKA which finally phosphorylates VASP at Ser- 157. A new EVH 1 domain has been described recently in the Spred proteins (Sprouty related proteins containing an EVH 1 domain) which are inhibitors of the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase pathway. Our laboratory has been involved in the elucidation of the atomic structure of the human Spred 2 EVH 1 domain by protein NMR spectroscopy (PDB 2 JP 2; 2007). A positively charged binding interface of this EVH 1 domain suggests an interaction with negatively charged ligands; however no interaction partners of this domain have been described so far. In the second part of this study, we used different genetic and biochemical screening methods to search for ligands of the Spred 2 EVH 1 domain. A bacterial two-hybrid system was established using a physically well characterized interaction of the VASP EVH 1 domain with a panel of its ActA binding peptides as positive controls to screen a human brain cDNA expression library at different stringencies for candidate Spred 2 EVH 1 interaction partners. However none of the clones isolated could be genetically and physically validated to support Spred 2 EVH 1 specific interactions. An in-vitro screening of a 9 -mer phage display peptide library using purified GST-Spred 2 EVH 1 fusion protein was performed together with a Fyn-SH 3 fusion protein as a positive control. In contrast to the Fyn-SH 3 domain the majority of phages isolated with the Spred 2 EVH 1 domain either carried no inserts or inserts with stop codons suggesting a highly non-specific interaction of the phage coat protein with the latter domain but neither the Fyn-SH 3 domain nor the GST moiety. Isolation of a 13 -mer proline-rich sequence was particularly surprising in this context. In order to address possible interactions of the Spred 2 EVH 1 domain with non-peptidergic ligands protein-lipid interaction assays were performed. Quantitative binding studies to purified Spred 2 EVH 1 using a liposome sedimentation assay however excluded any interaction of candidate phospholipids of the phosphatidyl inositol phosphate class with the Spred 2 EVH 1 domain. A natively folded and thus binding-competent conformation of the purified proteins used was assessed independently by 1 H protein NMR spectroscopy. In summary the cumulative evidence of our genetic and biochemical screening experiments suggests that the still elusive Spred 2 EVH 1 ligand(s) may be formed of hydrophobic peptide epitopes larger than nine amino acids in size and carrying negative charge(s). A phosphorylation of Spred 2 EVH 1 binding epitopes by a post-translational modification should be seriously considered in future experiments. Proteininteraktionen, wie sie durch katalytisch oder nicht-katalytisch wirksame Proteindomänen vermittelt werden können, spielen eine wesentliche Rolle in zellulären Signaltransduktionsprozessen durch die kovalente Modifikation oder nicht-kovalente Bindung von Interaktionspartnern. Ena/VASP Homologie 1 (EVH 1) Domänen finden sich als N-terminale, nicht-katalytische, etwa 115 Aminosäuren große und konserviert gefaltete Adaptormodule in vielen verschiedenen Signaltransduktionsproteinen. Indem sie ihre jeweiligen Wirtsproteine an deren subzellulärem Wirkort verankern helfen, sind sie an vielen verschiedenen Signalkaskaden wie z. B. Proteinphosphorylierungen oder Umbauprozessen des Zytoskeletts beteiligt. In dieser Arbeiten wurden Proteininteraktionen der beiden EVH 1 domänen-haltigen Proteine VASP and Spred 2 untersucht, die in nicht überlappenden Signaltransduktionswegen der Zelle vorkommen. EVH 1 Domänen wurden zuerst innerhalb der Ena/VASP-Proteinfamilie beschrieben, deren Gründungsmitglied das Vasodilator-stimulierte Phosphoprotein VASP ist. Als zytoskelett-assoziiertes Protein wechselwirkt VASP nicht nur mit verschiedenen Aktin-bindenden Proteinen, sondern ist auch ein Substrat der cAMP- und cGMP-abhängigen Proteinkinasen. Der vollständige Satz jener Proteinkinasen, die VASP als eines ihrer Substrate aufweisen, ist immer noch unbekannt. Hier haben wir kardiale Mausfibroblasten (MCFB) Zellen verwendet, um nach Serum-Stimulation dieser Zellen den Phosphorylierungsstatus von VASP zu bestimmen und daran beteiligte, neue Kandidaten-Proteinkinasen zu identifizieren. Mit Hilfe von Phosphorylierungsstellen-spezifischen Antikörpern konnten wir zeigen, dass eine Serum-Stimulation eine zeitabhängige Phosphorylierung von VASP an Serin 157 induziert, die ein Maximum 90 min nach Stimulation erreicht. Wir entwickelten ein Interaktionsgraphen-Modell möglicher Kandidaten-Proteinkinasen, die an diesem Prozess beteiligt sein könnten. Mit Hilfe pharmakologischer Perturbationsexperimente auf der Grundlage spezifischer Proteinkinase-Inhibitoren und Aktivatoren konnten wir einerseits eine Beteiligung der löslichen cGMP-abhängigen Proteinkinase und von Rho-Kinasen an diesem Prozess ausschliessen und anderseits die gemeinsame Beteiligung der klassischen Proteinkinase C Isoform(en) und der cAMP-abhängigen Proteinkinase nachweisen. In diesem Signalweg liegt dabei die Proteinkinase C stromaufwärts vor letzterer. Nach unserer Interpretation der Daten wird die PKC nach Serum-Stimulation der MCFB-Zellen aktiviert und aktiviert ihrerseits direkt oder indirekt die cAMP-abhängige Proteinkinase, die schliesslich VASP als proximales Substrat am Serin 157 phosphoryliert. Eine neue EVH 1 Domäne wurde kürzlich in den Spred Proteinen (Sprouty related proteins containing an EVH 1 domain) beschrieben, die neue Inhibitoren im Ras/Raf/MAP-Kinase-Signalweg darstellen. Unser Labor war an der NMR-gestützten Aufklärung der atomaren Struktur der Spred 2 EVH 1 Domäne beteiligt (PDB 2 JP 2; 2007). Die positiv geladene Bindungsfurche dieser EVH 1 Domäne legt eine Interaktion mit anionischen Liganden nahe. Interaktionspartner für diese Domäne sind bisher jedoch nicht beschrieben worden. Im zweiten Teil dieser Arbeit verwendeten wir verschiedene genetische und biochemische Suchverfahren zur Identifizierung möglicher Spred 2 EVH 1 Liganden. Ein bakterielles Two-Hybrid-System mit der Spred 2 EVH 1 Domäne als Köderprotein wurde dazu etabliert unter Verwendung der physikalisch gut charakterisierten Wechselwirkung der VASP EVH 1 Domäne mit ihren ActA Bindungspeptiden als eines positiven Kontroll-Interaktionspaars und zum verschieden stringenten Durchmustern einer humanen cDNA Expressionsgenbank aus Gehirn eingesetzt. Keiner der isolierten Klone ließ sich jedoch genetisch oder nach Sequenzierung in Hinblick auf eine Spred 2 EVH 1 spezifische Wechselwirkung validieren. Mittels gereinigtem GST-Spred 2 EVH 1 Protein wurde daher eine 9 -mer Peptid-Genbank im Phage-Display-Verfahren durchgemustert unter Verwendung eines Fyn-SH 3 Fusionsproteins als positiver Kontrolle. Im Gegensatz zu den Ergebnissen mit letzterer trugen die mit der Spred 2 EVH 1 Domäne isolierten Phagen überwiegend keine Inserts oder solche mit Stop-Codons, was eine unspezifische Wechselwirkung mit den Phagen-Hüllenproteinen dieser Domäne nicht jedoch der Fyn-SH 3 Domäne oder des GST-Partners nahelegt. Die Isolierung einer 13 -mer großen prolin-reichen Bindesequenz war in diesem Zusammenhang besonders überraschend. Um eine mögliche Wechselwirkung von Spred 2 EVH 1 mit nicht-peptidergen Liganden zu untersuchen, wurden Protein-Phospholipid-Interaktionsassays durchgeführt. Mittels quantitativer Bindungsstudien unter Verwendung der isolierten Domäne konnte eine Interaktion mit Kandidaten-Phospholipiden aus der Klasse der Phosphatidylinositolphosphate in einem Liposomen-Sedimentationsassay ausgeschlossen werden. Eine native Faltung und damit prinzipiell bindungskompetente Konformation(en) der gereinigten Proteine konnten mittels 1 H Protein-NMR-Spektroskopie sichergestellt werden. Zusammengenommen lassen unsere Experimente vermuten, dass es sich bei den noch immer nicht dingfest gemachten Spred 2 EVH 1 Liganden um hydrophobe, negative geladene, mehr als neun Aminosäuren umfassende Peptidepitope handeln könnte. Bei deren Identifizierung in zukünftigen Experimenten sollte mit ihrer Phosphorylierung durch post-translationale Modifikationen gerechnet werden...|$|R
