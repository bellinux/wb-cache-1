5000|$|Jae Woong Shim, {{author of}} the Analysis of Representation of Sexualtiy On Women’s and Men’s Pornographic Websites, {{describes}} her work, “We investigated how the sexuality {{of men and women}} is represented on pornographic websites <b>aimed</b> <b>at</b> women and pornographic websites <b>aimed</b> <b>at</b> men. We analyzed 200 pornographic images randomly selected from 4 websites (2 <b>aimed</b> <b>at</b> women and 2 <b>aimed</b> <b>at</b> men). The criteria for comparison were based on concepts of sexual inequality and sexual objectification that have been commonly used in the literature on analyses of pornography content. The findings showed that websites containing pornography <b>aimed</b> <b>at</b> men were more likely than the websites <b>aimed</b> <b>at</b> women to include content with elements of sexual inequality, whereas websites <b>aimed</b> <b>at</b> women were more likely than the websites <b>aimed</b> <b>at</b> men to include content with elements of sexual objectification." ...|$|R

40|$|A content {{analysis}} of 601 commercials was conducted {{in order to identify}} the appeals that characterize commercials <b>aimed</b> <b>at</b> children and teenagers. Our findings demonstrated that the use of appeals (a) showed strong age differences and (b) was highly gender-role stereotyped, particularly in commercials <b>aimed</b> <b>at</b> children. The most typical appeals in commercials <b>aimed</b> <b>at</b> male children were action-adventure, sports, and play, whereas commercials <b>aimed</b> <b>at</b> female children emphasized nurturing, physical attractiveness, friendship, and romance. Having the best, competition, and achievement were the dominant appeals in commercials <b>aimed</b> <b>at</b> male teenagers, whereas romance, sexuality, and belonging to a group were emphasized in commercials <b>aimed</b> <b>at</b> female teenagers...|$|R

5|$|Based on the James Bond film, Rare's GoldenEye 007 was {{released}} in 1997, and as of 2004 it was the best-selling Nintendo 64 game in the United States. It was the first landmark console first-person shooter and was highly acclaimed for its atmospheric single-player levels and well designed multiplayer maps. It featured a sniper rifle, the ability to perform head-shots, and the incorporation of stealth elements; (and all these aspects were also used in the game's spiritual sequel Perfect Dark) as well as Virtua Cop-inspired features such as reloading, position-dependent hit reaction animations, penalties for killing innocents, and an aiming system allowing players to <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> a precise spot on the screen.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} President Grant ran for reelection in 1872, Grant's {{administration}} had been rocked by scandal, and some disaffected {{members of his}} party formed the Liberal Republicans, naming Greeley as their candidate for president, a nomination soon joined in by the Democrats. Hay was unenthusiastic about the editor-turned-candidate, and in his editorials mostly took <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> Grant, who, despite the scandals, remained untarred, and who won a landslide victory in the election. Greeley died only weeks later, a broken man. Hay's stance endangered his hitherto sterling credentials in the Republican Party.|$|E

5|$|In Libya {{and other}} {{countries}} of the region, mass celebrations erupted, with the Lufthansa hijackers and the liberated Munich perpetrators being treated as heroes. Right after their arrival at the airport, a press conference was held, which was broadcast live around the world.

5|$|Once at war, Turkey joined Germany {{in taking}} <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> the {{opposing}} Entente Powers and their extensive empires in the Muslim world. Enver Pasha had the Sultan proclaim jihad.

Translations of the proclamation {{were sent to}} Berlin for propaganda purposes, for distribution to Muslim troops of the Entente Powers. However, while widely heard, the proclamation {{did not have the}} intended effect of mobilising global Muslim opinion on behalf of Turkey or the Central Powers.|$|E

She opened continuous fire, destroying a major portion of the Union whaling fleet. Capt. Waddell took <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> a fleeing whaler, Sophia Thornton, and at his signal, the gunner jerked a wrist strap and fired the last two shots of the American Civil War. Shenandoah had so far captured and burned eleven ships of the American whaling fleet while in Arctic waters.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Super Punch-Out!! {{is similar}} to that of its arcade and NES/FC predecessors. The player controls a nameable boxer as he fights his way to become W.V.B.A. Champion. The player controls the boxer from a third-person perspective, with him being translucent on the screen. Players can attack their opponents with jabs to the face or with body blows from either hand. The opponent can deflect punches, so players must <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> the opponent's open spot (where the gloves are not) to connect. Depending on the opponents' stances, they will guard themselves differently, so players need to use the correct punches.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea was}} first {{discussed}} in 2000. To make the game {{feel like a}} film, Revolution brought in a cinematic consultant, Bob Keen, who made sure the game conveyed emotions and atmosphere appropriate for each scene. The game was originally planned to have similar cartoon-quality visuals as its prequels, but the developers decided to <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> a style similar to Japanese animated films. Unlike the first two Broken Sword games, which used the Virtual Theatre engine, The Sleeping Dragon was built with the RenderWare engine. The game's music was composed by Ben McCullough, and Rolf Saxon returned to voice George Stobbart.|$|E
5|$|The {{third season}} sparked controversy, namely Mel B's {{attitude}} towards the other judges, labeling them dishonest and boring.

5|$|While historians value {{contemporary}} skaldic poetry highly as {{the most}} accurate source available, {{it must be remembered}} that the poems are not preserved independently but as quotations in the kings' sagas. After two centuries of oral preservation, there is often doubt that a verse was accurately remembered and correctly attributed. Furthermore, skaldic poetry did not primarily <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> giving information but at artistically rendering facts already known to the hearers. Historians frequently fall back on the less reliable but more detailed accounts of the sagas.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{was ready}} {{to carry out the}} {{assassination}} on July21. He wore a new suit and a black derby hat, and in his pockets he had a gun and a dagger fashioned from a steel file. He went to Frick's office and asked to see him, saying he was the representative of a New York hiring agency, but he was told Frick was too busy to meet him. The following night, Berkman checked into a hotel under the name Rakhmetov, his role model from What Is to Be Done? On July23, he returned to Frick's office. While the attendant told Frick that the New York employment agent had returned to see him, Berkman burst into the office and took <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> Frick's head. After two shots, Berkman was tackled to the ground. Still, he managed to pull out the dagger and stab Frick three times.|$|E
5|$|By October 1797, {{the plan}} to attack Ireland had been {{abandoned}} and the British North Sea Fleet was again at full strength. During a brief period replenishing supplies at Yarmouth, news reached Duncan on 10 October that the Dutch had sailed on a raiding cruise and {{he returned to the}} Dutch coast, intercepting de Winter's fleet on its way back to the Texel. The Dutch formed a line of battle in shallow coastal waters to meet Duncan's attack, which was conducted in a confused mass, the British fleet separating into two groups that struck the vanguard and rear of the Dutch fleet, overwhelming each in turn and capturing eleven ships, including de Winter's flagship Vrijheid. On the return journey, three of the captured ships were lost, and none of the surviving Dutch prizes was ever suitable for active service again. Both sides suffered heavy casualties during the battle as each fleet had been trained to <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> the hulls of their opponents, maximising the damage to personnel.|$|E
