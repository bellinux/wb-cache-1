5|$|The first {{generation}} of drug delivery liposomes had a simple lipid composition and suffered from several limitations. Circulation in the bloodstream was extremely limited due to both renal clearing and phagocytosis. Refinement of the lipid composition to tune fluidity, surface charge density, and surface hydration resulted in vesicles that <b>adsorb</b> fewer proteins from serum and thus are less readily recognized by the immune system. The most significant advance in this area was the grafting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) onto the liposome surface to produce “stealth” vesicles, which circulate over long times without immune or renal clearing.|$|E
5|$|The {{educational}} opportunities for secondary modern pupils were limited compared to those at grammar schools, prompting criticism of the Tripartite system. In 1965, the Labour Government issued Circular 10/65 requesting Local Education Authorities implement comprehensive schooling. In 1971 Sleaford parents voted in favour of comprehensive education, but rejected the Council's proposals. A new plan which envisaged Carre's becoming a sixth form college was supported by parents in a vote (1,199 to 628), albeit with a 50% turnout; the County Council approved it but allowed governors a veto. Following negotiations with governors at Carre's, the scheme was revised so that Carre's would be an 11–18 school and <b>adsorb</b> Sleaford Secondary Modern's Church Lane site. Despite support from most staff and all three headteachers, Lincolnshire County Council voted to return the scheme for consultation in 1975. A new system was proposed which retained all three schools, and when the Government ordered the Council to choose a comprehensive scheme in 1977 it submitted that proposal, which had become popular with parents. The next year the government dismissed it on grounds that the Sixth Forms would be too small, but the council voted against the two-school system once more.|$|E

5|$|The {{manner in}} which the puffball splits open (dehisces) has been {{described}} by 19th-century American mycologist William Henry Long. The thick and leathery peridium of the mature puffball remains unopened for several months without splitting. After several alternating cycles of wetting and drying, fissures develop across the top. These fissures usually radiate from a common center {{near the top of the}} fruit body and finally produce very irregular star-like teeth. In time, the entire upper half of the puffball is open and exposed during dry weather. In this condition, the spores are blown out by the wind and widely distributed. During every rainy spell the puffball promptly closes only to open again when dry weather returns. At each alternate opening and closing the peridium is split more and more, until finally it is expanded into a flat shape, or even curls backward. In the puffball, the outer layer of the peridium comprises cells arranged so that when wet they <b>adsorb</b> water and expand, thus closing the top of the puffball. Upon drying, these outer cells lose water and gradually shrink, thus producing an unequal tension between the outer and inner cells of the peridium. This tension causes the irregular star-like pieces of the peridium to gradually separate and curve outward, thus opening the top of the puffball during dry weather.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} initial treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning is stabilizing the patient. As ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed, gastric decontamination {{is unlikely to}} be of benefit unless it is performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Traditionally, gastric lavage or nasogastric aspiration of gastric contents are the most common methods employed in ethylene glycol poisoning. The usefulness of gastric lavage has, however, been questioned, and it is now no longer used routinely in poisoning situations. Ipecac-induced vomiting is not recommended. As activated charcoal does not <b>adsorb</b> glycols, it is not recommended as it will not be effective at preventing absorption. It is only used {{in the presence of a}} toxic dose of another poison or drug. Patients with significant poisoning often present in a critical condition. In this situation stabilization of the patient including airway management with intubation should be performed in preference to gastrointestinal decontamination. Patients presenting with metabolic acidosis or seizures require treatment with sodium bicarbonate and anticonvulsives such as a benzodiazepine respectively. Sodium bicarbonate should be used cautiously as it can worsen hypocalcemia by increasing the plasma protein binding of calcium. If hypocalcemia occurs it can be treated with calcium replacement although calcium supplementation can increase the precipitation of calcium oxalate crystals leading to tissue damage. Intubation and respiratory support may be required in severely intoxicated patients; patients with hypotension require treatment with intravenous fluids and possibly vasopressors.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 <b>Adsorbed</b> {{proteins}} on {{surfaces are}} important in many applications, including medical implants, sensors, marine materials, and in vitro substrates for cell culture and other uses. Understanding the protein structure on the surface would allow better control of {{the interaction of the}} material with the surrounding environment and a more reproducible system response. Protein adsorption is a complex process, and characterization requires the combination of multiple analysis techniques. In this thesis, <b>adsorbed</b> protein amounts were measured using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and radiolabeled proteins. Protein conformation and orientation were measured using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), near edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS), sum frequency generation (SFG), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Surface type influenced the <b>adsorbed</b> surface concentration of albumin and fibronectin on surfaces of glass, polystyrene, titanium, and sulfonated polystyrene as measured by XPS and radiolabeled protein adsorption. More albumin <b>adsorbed</b> onto polystyrene than glass. More albumin and fibronectin <b>adsorbed</b> onto sulfonated polystyrene than titanium. ToF-SIMS also showed differences in structure of the proteins <b>adsorbed</b> onto the different surfaces. The A 1 domain of von Willebrand Factor <b>adsorbed</b> in similar amounts onto glass, tissue culture polystyrene, and polystyrene surfaces, as measured by XPS. However, ToF-SIMS showed differences in solution exposure of A 1 domain amino acids when <b>adsorbed</b> onto the three surfaces and NEXAFS showed the most ordered beta-sheet structure when A 1 was <b>adsorbed</b> onto polystyrene. ELISA showed lowest binding of antibodies recognizing a nonlinear epitopes within A 1 when A 1 was <b>adsorbed</b> onto polystyrene. Functional studies using a parallel plate flow chamber measured platelet binding to A 1 <b>adsorbed</b> onto the three surfaces. At high shear (20 dyne/cm 2), platelets showed most detachment from A 1 <b>adsorbed</b> onto glass. At low shear (0. 2 dyne/cm 2), platelets showed most detachment from A 1 <b>adsorbed</b> onto polystyrene. Surface analysis was also useful in characterizing collagen substrates created under different experimental conditions, including material source and pH. Collagen obtained from different sources exhibited altered adsorption behavior, both in amount <b>adsorbed</b> as measured by XPS and interaction with the A 1 domain of von Willebrand Factor as measured by ToF-SIMS. SFG was used to identify differences in ordering of collagen <b>adsorbed</b> from solutions at different pH values. Collagen <b>adsorbed</b> at pH 8. 0 showed higher SFG amide signal than collagen <b>adsorbed</b> at pH 6. 5, suggesting greater ordering of the peptide backbone at pH 8. 0. The differences in SFG signal were not due to the amount <b>adsorbed</b> protein, as XPS showed more collagen <b>adsorbed</b> onto tissue culture polystyrene at pH 6. 5 than pH 8. 0. These studies demonstrated that the surface type can have a large impact on <b>adsorbed</b> proteins, both in amount <b>adsorbed</b> and surface structure. These studies also showed that surface analysis is very useful in creating defined in vitro protein substrates. In all cases, it was crucial to use multiple analysis techniques to understand these systems...|$|R

The presence of the metal serves as a lower-energy pathway for gaseous species to first <b>adsorb</b> to the metal and then diffuse on the support surface.
