500|$|Fighting {{tactics are}} governed by several actual rules and enforcers will also adopt {{informal}} tactics particular to their style and personality. One tactic adopted by players is known as [...] "going for it", in which the player puts {{his head down and}} just throws as many punches as he can, <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>can.</b> In the process, that player takes as many punches as he delivers, although some of them are to the hard forehead. Fighters usually must keep one hand on their opponent's jersey since the ice surface makes maintaining balance very difficult. For this reason, the majority of a hockey fight consists of the players holding on with one hand and punching with the other.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Spitz {{is quoted}} as saying, [...] "When I went to the Olympics, I had every {{intention}} of shaving the moustache off, but I realized I was getting so many comments about it—and everybody was talking about it—that I decided to keep it. [...] I had some fun with a Russian coach who asked me if my moustache slowed me down. [...] I said, 'No, {{as a matter of}} fact, it deflects water away from my mouth, allows my rear end to rise and make me bullet-shaped in the water, and that's what had allowed me to swim so great.' [...] He's translating <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> for the other coaches, and the following year every Russian male swimmer had a moustache." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then he's awa to London town, [...] Ay e'en <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> dree; [...] Fause {{witnesses}} he has wi' him ta'en. [...] An' ta'en Monmouth's head f'rae his body.|$|E
60|$|Regardless of the heat, the sleuth-hound hurried {{across to}} Outwood's <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could walk.|$|R
60|$|Then the {{reindeer}} {{flew over}} the ground, through the great forest, <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could.|$|R
60|$|Off {{went the}} pursuer <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> dared, and Tom {{continued}} his flight with more caution.|$|R
6000|$|He has tied them a' wi' St. Mary's knot, [...] A' these horses but barely three; [...] He's loupen on ane, ta'en {{another in}} hand, [...] And away <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> hie.|$|E
6000|$|... "On, now, Jeremy!" [...] cried Blood. [...] "Straight {{into them}} before they recover their wits. Stand by, there! Prepare to board! Hayton ... the grapnels! And pass the word to the gunner in the prow to fire <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> load." ...|$|E
60|$|Macky. He is brave in his person, bold in his expressions, and rectifies, <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>can,</b> the slips of {{his youth}} by acts of honesty; which he now glories in more, than he was {{formerly}} extravagant.--Swift. He was little better than a conceited talker in company.|$|E
60|$|So Peter Rabbit {{started down}} the Lone Little Path through the wood <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could go after Striped Chipmunk.|$|R

60|$|So the Lion aroused {{himself and}} bounded forward <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could go. In {{a moment he}} was out of sight.|$|R
60|$|He's up {{and away}} from Fort Bukloh <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> fly, Till {{he was aware of}} his father's mare in the gut of the Tongue of Jagai, Till he was aware of his father's mare with Kamal upon her back, And when he could spy the white of her eye, he made the pistol crack.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother, Helen is right; {{we should}} speak out, and not hide this bitter fact any longer. The world will pity {{us, and we}} must bear the pity, but it would condemn us for deceit, and we should deserve the {{condemnation}} if we let this misery go on. Living a lie will ruin us all. Bella will be destroyed as Helen was; I am only {{the shadow of a}} man now, and Hal is killing himself <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>can,</b> to avoid the fate we all dread." ...|$|E
60|$|Sitting {{there in}} the third-class carriage, he became happy again. The {{presence}} of his fellow-passengers was not so hampering as in England. In England, everybody seems held tight and gripped, nothing is left free. Every passenger seems like a parcel holding his string <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> about him, lest {{one corner of the}} wrapper should come undone and reveal what is inside. And every other passenger is forced, by the public will, to hold himself as tight-bound also. Which in the end becomes a sort of self-conscious madness.|$|E
60|$|As {{soon as the}} ex-coachman had {{recovered}} his feet and his wits <b>he</b> hastened <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could eastward toward Broadway.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you have}} my arm?" [...] said Silverbridge, who saw Miss Boncassen {{scudding}} along, with Dolly Longstaff following <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could.|$|R
60|$|The {{moment the}} cellar-door was opened he shuffled {{down the steps}} <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could go. He knew there was {{somebody}} down there.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} I ought to, count. If the news has come that Frederick is marching to besiege Dresden, he cannot be far away; {{for it is}} certain that he will march <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>can,</b> and will himself follow closely on the news. 'Tis plain that Lacy feels himself unable to oppose him, and must be falling back with all speed before him. If I were to report myself this evening as convalescent, I can join him tomorrow, if I find that he is but a march away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Mr. Meadow Mouse,' said old Mother Nature, and {{her voice}} was very stern, 'I know {{that you did not}} steal the acorns of Striped Chipmunk. I know that you did not even guess that there were stolen acorns in that bag. Everyone else thinks that you are the thief who caused so much trouble on the Green Meadows and in the Green Forest. But I know who the real thief is and he is {{stealing}} away <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> go down the Lone Little Path this very minute.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you why I did not, Paul," [...] she explained. [...] "Reggie is in town-- {{just for a few}} days. I have sent him a {{telephone}} message and he is wild with delight. He has only just arrived from Scotland; but I told him Mr. Bundercombe and his daughter were here, and he is rushing into his clothes <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> and is coming round. It will be so delightful for him to meet them again, and I really must try to think myself what I can do to repay all their kindness to Reggie." ...|$|E
60|$|So Striped Chipmunk {{started down}} the Lone Little Path through the wood <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could run. Pretty soon he met Peter Rabbit.|$|R
50|$|Thereupon the {{man went}} home <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could go, but very {{soon after that}} his house burned, for the Alan kept their word.|$|R
60|$|PETER {{got down}} very quietly off the wheelbarrow, and started running <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could go, along a {{straight}} walk behind some black-currant bushes.|$|R
6000|$|He hails Claude cheerfully {{from the}} platform, as he waddles about, {{with a face}} as of the rising sun, radiant with good fun, good humour, good deeds, good news, and good living. His coat was scarlet once; but purple now. His leathers and boots were doubtless clean this morning; but are now afflicted with elephantiasis, being three inches deep in solid mud, which his old groom is {{scraping}} off <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>can.</b> His cap is duntled in; his back bears fresh stains of peat; a gentle rain distils from the few angles of his person, and bedews the platform; for Mark Armsworth has [...] "been in Whit" [...] to-day.|$|E
60|$|The pearl-diver descends by {{the help}} of a long rope, to the end of which is {{attached}} a heavy stone. He stands on the stone, holds the rope with one hand and his nose with the other, and quickly sinks to the bottom. Then he goes to work, <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>can,</b> to fill a net which hangs from his neck, with the pearl-oysters. When he can stay down no longer, the net and stone are drawn up by the cord, and he rises to the surface, often with blood running from his nose and ears. But then, those who employ them sometimes get an oyster with as fine pearls as this one contains.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{carry you}} very well," [...] she says, [...] "but I {{will tell you}} what we will do; we will stop at the first tavern we come to and rest. Do you see that large flat stone out there {{at the turn of the}} road? That is the tavern, and you shall be my courier. A courier is a man that goes forward <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> on his horse, and tells the tavern-keeper that the {{traveller}} is coming, and orders supper. So you may gallop on as fast as you can go, and, when you get to the tavern, tell the tavern-keeper that the princess is coming--I am the princess--and that he must get ready an excellent supper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This isn't {{any place}} for me!" [...] said Peter Rabbit, and off he {{started for the}} Green Meadows <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could go, lipperty-lipperty-lip! ...|$|R
5000|$|And {{because it}} was not far from Lisbon, where he knew there were many Genoese his countrymen, <b>he</b> went away thither <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come on--I'll race you!" [...] {{cried the}} smaller lad, and away <b>he</b> went <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could on his snowshoes, and Snap came after him.|$|R
60|$|Conversation is now entirely dropped; {{each person}} gazes vacantly {{through the window}} in front of him, and {{everybody}} thinks that his opposite neighbour is staring at him. If one man gets out at Shoe-lane, and another {{at the corner of}} Farringdon-street, the little old gentleman grumbles, and suggests to the latter, that if he had got out at Shoe-lane too, he would have saved them the delay of another stoppage; whereupon the young men laugh again, and the old gentleman looks very solemn, and says nothing more till he gets to the Bank, when he trots off <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>can,</b> leaving us to do the same, and to wish, as we walk away, that we could impart to others any portion of the amusement we have gained for ourselves.|$|E
6000|$|The good Doctor {{drove over}} to dine {{with them that}} very day. [...] "If you agitate {{yourself}} so," [...] he said to her, [...] "and if your heart beats so, and if you persist in being so anxious about a young gentleman who is getting well <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>can,</b> we shall have you laid up, and Miss Laura to watch you; {{and then it will}} be her turn to be ill, and I should like to know how the deuce a doctor is to live who is obliged to come and attend you all for nothing? Mrs. Goodenough is already jealous of you, and says, with perfect justice, that I fall in love with my patients. And you must please {{to get out of the}} country as soon as ever you can, that I may have a little peace in my family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Let’s see,’ resumed the manager, {{telling the}} number on his fingers, ‘we shall have three dancing female peasants, besides Fenella, and four fishermen. Then, there’s our man Tom; he can have a pair of ducks of mine, and a check shirt of Bob’s, and a red nightcap, and he’ll do for another—that’s five. In the choruses, of course, we can sing at the sides; and in the market-scene we can walk about in cloaks and things. When the revolt takes place, Tom must keep rushing in {{on one side and}} out on the other, with a pickaxe, <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>can.</b> The effect will be electrical; it will look exactly as if there were an immense number of ’em. And in the eruption-scene we must burn the red fire, and upset the tea-trays, and make all sorts of noises—and it’s sure to do.’ ...|$|E
60|$|So away went Reddy Fox <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{could run}} down the Lone Little Path after Striped Chipmunk, Peter Rabbit, Bobby Coon and Jimmy Skunk.|$|R
60|$|The Bee-man {{scrambled}} to his feet, and ran <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could {{to the place}} where he had hidden his hive and his old doublet.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is too bad!" [...] {{thought the}} Bee-man. [...] "Somebody {{ought to do}} something." [...] And turning around, <b>he</b> ran away <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could.|$|R
