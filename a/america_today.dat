5|$|The {{only two}} {{houses in the}} United States—from the English colonial period (1607–1776)—that can be {{definitively}} attributed to designs from the Four Books of Architecture are architect William Buckland's Hammond-Harwood House (1774) in Annapolis, Maryland, and Thomas Jefferson's first Monticello. The design source for the Hammond-Harwood House is Villa Pisani at Montagnana (Book II, Chapter XIV), {{and for the first}} Monticello (1770) the design source is Villa Cornaro at Piombino Dese (Book II, Chapter XIV). Thomas Jefferson later covered this façade with additions so that the Hammond-Harwood House remains the only pure and pristine example of direct modeling in <b>America</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Mormonism gained {{popularity}} in the Pacific, church-sponsored schools became more common. The Makeke School, founded by Coombs in the 1920s, became {{the foundation for the}} later established Liahona College. The church leased 276 acres near Nuku'alofa. The Liahona School opened in 1952 and led to a great expansion of the church. The Liahona School was intended to allow for more students with more hired faculty members and a broader curriculum. The education provided to Tongan students prepared them for life outside of Tonga, whether it was pursuing a secondary education or a job in <b>America.</b> <b>Today,</b> the school is known as Liahona High School.|$|E

[...] Several songs on Zappa's 1988 album Broadway the Hard Way ridicule Reagan, notably [...] "Promiscuous," [...] which jabs at the Reagans' attempts to reduce sex education in public schools and replace it with abstinence-only propaganda as well as his slow response to the AIDS pandemic.|$|E
500|$|The {{politician}} and architect Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826) once referred to Palladio's [...] Quattro Libri as his bible. Jefferson acquired an intense appreciation of Palladio's architectural concepts, and his designs {{for his own}} beloved Monticello, the James Barbour Barboursville estate, Virginia State Capitol, and the University of Virginia were based on drawings from Palladio's book. Realizing the powerful political significance pertaining to ancient Roman buildings, Jefferson designed his civic buildings in the Palladian style. Monticello (remodelled between 1796 and 1808) is quite clearly based on Palladio's Villa Capra, however, with modifications, in a style which is described in <b>America</b> <b>today</b> as Colonial Georgian. Jefferson's Pantheon, or Rotunda, at the University of Virginia is undeniably Palladian in concept and style.|$|E
