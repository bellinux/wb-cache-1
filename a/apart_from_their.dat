Dorothea (Doroslava), married Ban Tvrtko I of Bosnia and became the first Queen of Bosnia while Constantine II succeeded him as Emperor of Bulgaria. Sratsimir also had another daughter, who died young at the court of Elizabeth of Poland.|$|E
5|$|Subfossil {{bones of}} the Mascarene grey parakeet found on Mauritius were first {{described}} in 1973 as belonging to a smaller relative of the broad-billed parrot in the genus Lophopsittacus. <b>Apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> size, the bones were {{very similar to those}} of other Mascarene parrots. The subfossils were later connected with 17th- and 18th-century descriptions of small grey parrots on Mauritius and Réunion, together with a single illustration published in a journal describing a voyage in 1602, and the species was instead reassigned to the genus Psittacula.|$|E

5000|$|There is no {{mechanism}} for defining the presentation and interactive behavior of elements equivalent to XBL used in XUL (or sXBL used in SVG).

5|$|There was no {{distinct}} Angevin or Plantagenet {{culture that}} would distinguish or set them <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> neighbours in this period. Robert of Torigni recorded that Henry built or renovated castles throughout his domain in Normandy, England, Aquitaine, Anjou, Maine and Torraine. However this patronage had no distinctive style {{except in the}} use of circular or octagonal kitchens of the Fontevraud type. Similarly amongst the multiple vernacularsFrench, English and Occitanthere was not a unifying literature. French was the lingua franca of the secular elite and Latin or the church.|$|E
5|$|<b>Apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> blue colour, {{the mythical}} creatures {{look much like}} humans, and {{are about the same}} size. They have the power to create storms, but when the weather is fine they float {{sleeping}} on or just {{below the surface of the}} water. The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.|$|E
5|$|<b>Apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> {{function}} in locomotion, the tube feet act as accessory gills. The water vascular system serves to transport oxygen from, {{and carbon dioxide}} to, the tube feet and also nutrients from the gut to the muscles involved in locomotion. Fluid movement is bidirectional and initiated by cilia. Gas exchange also takes place through other gills known as papulae, which are thin-walled bulges on the aboral surface of the disc and arms. Oxygen is transferred from these to the coelomic fluid, which acts as the transport medium for gasses. Oxygen dissolved in the water is distributed through the body mainly by the fluid in the main body cavity; the circulatory system may also play a minor role.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, English ornithologist Daniel T. Holyoak {{described}} {{some small}} parrot bones {{that he had}} discovered among a collection of broad-billed parrot (Lophopsittacus mauritianus) subfossils in the Zoology Museum of Cambridge University. These remains had been collected by Louis Etienne Thirioux in the early 20th century, who had found them in a cave on Le Pouce mountain, on the Mascarene island of Mauritius. They {{were placed in the}} zoology museum by 1908. <b>Apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> size and robustness, Holyoak did not find the bones to be distinct from those of the Mascarene parrot genera Lophopsittacus, Mascarinus (the Mascarene parrot), Necropsittacus (the Rodrigues parrot), and Psittacula (which had two or three other species inhabiting the Mascarene islands). Because of their similarities, Holyoak considered all these genera to be closely related.|$|E
5|$|Many {{anthozoans}} are {{colonial and}} consist of multiple polyps {{with a common}} origin joined together by living material. The simplest arrangement is where a stolon runs along the substrate in a two dimensional lattice with polyps budding off at intervals. Alternatively, polyps may bud off from a sheet of living tissue, the coenosarc, which joins the polyps and anchors the colony to the substrate. The coenosarc may consist of a thin membrane from which the polyps project, as in most stony corals, or a thick fleshy mass in which the polyps are immersed <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> oral discs, as in the soft corals.|$|E
5|$|Aetosauria {{was first}} named in 1889 by English naturalist Richard Lydekker and {{zoologist}} Henry Alleyne Nicholson. They considered Aetosauria {{to be one}} of three suborders of the order Crocodilia, the other two being Parasuchia (a Triassic group) and Eusuchia (a group including all post-Triassic crocodiles). At the time, Cope considered Aetosauria to belong to Rhynchocephalia, an order of reptiles that includes the living tuatara. He also thought that the tightly fitting osteoderms, which were thought to be fused to the ribs, indicated that aetosaurs were transitional between rhynchocephalians and turtles. Nicholson and Lydekker placed a single family within the suborder, Aëtosauridæ. They considered aetosaurs to be similar to living crocodilians <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> elongated metatarsals, which were compared to those of dinosaurs. In fact, Marsh considered aetosaurs to be closely related to dinosaurs because both had similar metatarsals.|$|E

25|$|Few {{parents who}} have {{disrupted}} adoptions {{have been willing to}} talk about the process, since it carries a strong social stigma.

5|$|Committed {{to living}} the {{philosophy}} they sing about, {{the band members}} have each pursued careers <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> lives as the superstars of Malagasy pop music. Most {{of the members of}} Mahaleo have also launched individual humanitarian projects, in addition to the cooperative they formed together in the 1980s to support the hand-made production of traditional musical instruments, and the Centre des informations de communication, d'animation, formation et d'éducation (CICAFE) rural development center they launched in 2000. As the years passed {{and the members of the}} band matured in their respective careers, they started to write songs more relevant to the difficult conditions of life of the Malagasy people and the underdeveloped state of the nation, addressing such topics as environmental conservation, poverty, education, and violence. Among their hits in this period are songs that address rural-urban flight, homesickness after moving abroad to find work, husbands who abandon their families, and the guilt of military personnel required to carry out repression against their compatriots.|$|E
5|$|Whilst Wigan Warriors and Wigan Athletic {{flourished in}} the new stadium (Wigan Athletic in {{particular}} would achieve significant success, rising up the English football pyramid to the Premier League by 2005), Orrell R.U.F.C. did not. Dave Whelan and Maurice Lindsay decided to invest heavily in the club, {{with the aim of}} having the club play in rugby union's Guinness Premiership at the stadium. After failing to win 2004's National Division Two, Whelan pulled a large amount of investment from the club, to a more modest GB£30,000 a year. This was the beginning of Orrell's demise, as players left during the summer of that year and the club were consequently relegated the season after. Ownership eventually passed from Lindsay back to the club's members, but by this point, Orrell had sold their former Edge Hall Road ground to Dave Whelan's company, Whelco Holdings, and therefore had no assets <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> rebuilt clubhouse following a fire in 2002. Orrell never settled at the JJB Stadium, and were eventually de-professionalised {{at the end of the}} 2006–07 season.|$|E
5|$|William Taylor and Helen Cartwright are two {{children}} {{who live in}} the city of Bellbridge (a fictionalised version of London). Will is an aspiring football player, Helen a prodigy violinist. Over the years, both have grown <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> respective parents; Helen has chosen to spend more time practising the violin with her friends rather than with her mother, a choice which has begun to fill her with guilt, while Will's father is transferred to another city for work and leaves his son by himself. Both children suffer nightmares and come under attack by the Nightmaren, who chase them into the world of Nightopia. There, the {{two children}} meet and free Nights, who has the ability to merge with the children, allowing them to share Nights' body and fly through the skies. Learning that Wizeman is plotting to take over the dream world and consequently enter the real world, the children and Nights resolve to stop Wizeman, but face resistance from the Nightmaren he commands, particularly Nights' sibling, Reala.|$|E
