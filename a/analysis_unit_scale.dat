50|$|By scaling the {{resulting}} map, two parallels {{can be assigned}} <b>unit</b> <b>scale,</b> with scale decreasing between the two parallels and increasing outside them. This gives the map two standard parallels. In this way, deviation from <b>unit</b> <b>scale</b> can be minimized within a region of interest that lies largely between the two standard parallels. Unlike other conic projections, no true secant form of the projection exists because using a secant cone does not yield the same scale along both standard parallels.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a service platform for distributed multimedia content analysis. The platform enables versatile analysis of different content types, including video, image, audio and textual content. The platform is implemented using web service technologies applying a modular design where different analysis tasks {{are provided by}} individual services, called <b>analysis</b> <b>units.</b> Detailed descriptions of the <b>analysis</b> <b>units</b> are stored in a service registry. A simple {{and easy to use}} web service interface is provided to the platform via which client applications can utilize all the provided analysis functionalities even in a single request. The platform is easily extensible as new <b>analysis</b> <b>units</b> can be added simply by registering them to the service registry. After a new unit has been registered, it is immediately available for use. An <b>analysis</b> <b>unit</b> can also form a service composition by utilizing other existing units in order to provide higher level semantic analysis results. A uniform metadata model for presenting the analysis results enables interoperability between different <b>analysis</b> <b>units.</b> The scalability of the platform is enabled via a resource-aware load balancing method. The load between replicated <b>analysis</b> <b>units</b> is balanced according to their computational capacity and current load level. The efficiency of the developed load balancing method is measured by replicating a single <b>analysis</b> <b>unit</b> into a heterogeneous hardware environment. The platform's ability to compose the results from different <b>analysis</b> <b>units</b> as a response to a single request is demonstrated in a composition test, where a client application sends requests for different analysis result combinations...|$|R
5000|$|European Bitterness <b>Units</b> <b>scale,</b> often {{abbreviated}} as EBU, is a {{scale for}} measuring the perceived bitterness of beer, with lower values being generally [...] "less bitter" [...] and higher values [...] "more bitter". The scale and method are defined by the European Brewery Convention, and the numerical value {{should be the same}} as of the International Bitterness <b>Units</b> <b>scale</b> (IBU), defined in co-operation with the American Society of Brewing Chemists. However, the exact process of determining EBU and IBU values differs slightly, which may in theory result with slightly smaller values for EBU than IBU.|$|R

40|$|The habitat {{requirements}} of western freshwater mussels, Anodonta, Gonidea, and Margaritifera remain unclear despite their imperiled status. To improve {{the efficacy of}} restoration actions targeting these organisms, we used Random Forest modeling to investigate the biotic and abiotic factors influencing mussel density and distribution throughout a 55 - kilometer segment of river. We collected data at both the reach and channel <b>unit</b> <b>scale</b> to investigate how mussel-habitat relationships vary with spatial scale. Margaritifera density exhibited a unimodal distribution while Anodonta and Gonidea density increased in a downstream direction. Model performance was greatest with Margaritifera at the reach scale, and reach scale models generally outperformed channel <b>unit</b> <b>scale</b> models. Physical habitat characteristics such as woody debris, emergent aquatic vegetation, substrate size, and channel shape generally had higher variable importance than hydraulic, biotic, and chemical variables. These results suggest that at the reach and channel <b>unit</b> <b>scale,</b> mussel abundance and distribution is influenced by high flow refugia and habitat heterogeneity. We anticipate that knowledge gained from this study will assist mussel restoration efforts by providing specific guidance about where suitable habitat may occur...|$|R

30|$|Torching {{potential}} expressed at the <b>unit</b> <b>scale</b> was low in this study, but {{the bias}} in the measurements before and after treatment (variable area versus variable radius plots to inventory trees) makes direct comparison of pre- and post-treatment data risky. We believe the variable radius plots used after treatment were more reliable, because prism sampling is unbiased. Occasional plots contained no trees. In contrast, the variable area plots were expanded as needed to include at least 10 trees per sample, so that every plot contained trees, and this resulted in higher basal area expressed at the <b>unit</b> <b>scale</b> (see control <b>unit</b> basal areas in Tables 1 and 3). Comparison of torching index values for just the post-treatment data show little torching potential.|$|R

40|$|The CORDIC {{algorithm}} for {{the calculation}} of trigonometric functions has traditionally suffered from two problems; speed, and the necessity to pre-scale the inputs. The speed problem is overcome {{to a large extent}} by the introduction of redundant number systems which have been shown by others. Here we show a new CORDIC system which has a <b>unit</b> <b>scale</b> factor that can be ignored. The <b>unit</b> <b>scale</b> factor is achieved by rotating the vector in 3 dimensional space in a manner which scales its projection onto the X-Y plane by the reciprocal of the overall scale factor. This new technique takes the same number of cycles as the standard CORDIC algorithm, with only marginally slower cycle times than the redundant system of Takagi. The system is shown to be entirely compatible with redundant number system implementations of the CORDIC algorithm...|$|R
