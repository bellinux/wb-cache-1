5|$|One {{of the few}} {{resources}} not in short supply was petroleum oil; supplies intended for Europe were filling British storage facilities. Considerable effort and enthusiasm was put into making use of petroleum products as <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> war. The Army had not had flame-throwers since the First World War, but a significant number were improvised from pressure greasing equipment acquired from automotive repair garages. Although limited in range, they were reasonably effective.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Federation {{starship}} Enterprise. In this episode, an injured Borg drone (Jonathan Del Arco) is found amid a crashed scout ship. As they restore him to health, the crew must {{decide whether or not to}} develop him as <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> mass destruction against the Borg, but when he demonstrates free will, they must question that decision.|$|E

5|$|The {{identification}} of German missile sites by the PRU made Operation Crossbow possible in 1944. Coastal Command continually identified German V-1 launch ramps, despite the German camouflage efforts. This enabled British aircraft to bomb them and reduce their effectiveness by one-third. By June, 69 ramps had been located, {{although it was}} not until 26 February 1945, when Squadron Leader J.E.S. White actually spotted a V-2, on its launch pad, ready to fire, that it became clear how elusive <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> that size could be.|$|E

5|$|Horses {{have been}} used in warfare for most of {{recorded}} history. The first archaeological evidence of horses used in warfare dates to between 4000 and 3000 BC, and the use of horses in warfare was widespread {{by the end of the}} Bronze Age. Although mechanization has largely replaced the horse as <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> war, horses are still seen today in limited military uses, mostly for ceremonial purposes, or for reconnaissance and transport activities in areas of rough terrain where motorized vehicles are ineffective. Horses {{have been used}} in the 21st century by the Janjaweed militias in the War in Darfur.|$|E

5|$|NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center {{acquired}} an F-4A on 3 December 1965. It made 55 flights {{in support of}} short programs, chase on X-15 missions and lifting body flights. The F-4 also supported a biomedical monitoring program involving 1,000 flights by NASA Flight Research Center aerospace research pilots and students of the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School flying high-performance aircraft. The pilots were instrumented to record accurate and reliable data of electrocardiogram, respiration rate and normal acceleration. In 1967, the Phantom supported a brief military-inspired program to determine whether an airplane's sonic boom could be directed and whether {{it could be used}} as <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> sorts, or at least an annoyance. NASA also flew an F-4C in a spanwise blowing study from 1983 to 1985, after which it was returned.|$|E

Harry and Hermione lead her into an area of the forest inhabited by centaurs, where Umbridge provokes them into taking her captive. The centaurs are furious upon learning that Hermione used them to do her bidding and turn on the pair, but Grawp arrives and clashes with the centaurs, allowing Harry and Hermione to escape.|$|E
5|$|Nichols stood trial twice. He {{was first}} tried {{by the federal}} {{government}} in 1997 and found guilty of conspiring to build <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> mass destruction and of eight counts of involuntary manslaughter of federal officers. After he was sentenced on June 4, 1998 to life without parole, the State of Oklahoma in 2000 sought a death-penalty conviction on 161counts of first-degree murder (160non-federal agent victims and onefetus). On May 26, 2004 the jury found him guilty on all charges, but deadlocked on the issue of sentencing him to death. Presiding Judge Steven W. Taylor then determined the sentence of 161consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole. In March 2005, FBI investigators, acting on a tip, searched a buried crawl space in Nichols' former house and found additional explosives missed in the preliminary search after Nichols was arrested.|$|E
5|$|Returning to {{the surface}} with Kida, Milo discovers Rourke has the missing page. Rourke and the crew betray Milo, {{intending}} to bring the crystal {{to the surface}} and sell it. Rourke mortally wounds the King of Atlantis while trying to extract information about the crystal's location, but finds its location for himself hidden beneath the King's throne room. The crystal detects a threat before merging with Kida. Rourke and the mercenaries lock Kida in a crate and prepare to leave the city. Knowing that when the crystal is gone the Atlanteans will die, Milo berates his friends for betraying their consciences, and ultimately convinces them to leave Rourke and remain in Atlantis. The King explains to Milo that the crystal has developed a consciousness; it thrives on the collective emotions of the Atlanteans and provides power, protection, and longevity in return. It will find a royal host when Atlantis is in danger. He then reveals that the sinking of Atlantis was caused when he attempted to use it as <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> war. As he dies, he gives his crystal to Milo, telling him to save Atlantis and Kida. Encouraged by Sweet, Milo rallies the crew, and the Atlanteans to stop Rourke.|$|E

5|$|The crew {{discover}} a wrecked Borg scout ship {{with a single}} survivor: a young Borg drone. Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) insists on treating the surviving Borg despite the concerns of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). On Picard's orders, the drone is confined and monitored by security forces at all times and is prevented from contacting the Borg Collective. Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) and Lt. Commander Data assist Crusher in bringing the Borg back to health. As they {{come to understand the}} workings of the Borg, La Forge and Data postulate an idea of using the Borg drone as <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> mass destruction. By implanting an unsolvable geometric formula into his mind and returning him back to the Collective, the formula should rapidly spread (similar to a computer virus) and disable the Borg. Crusher is aghast at this suggestion, considering it equivalent to genocide, while Picard and the other senior crew deliberate on the ethics of this plan.|$|E
5|$|During Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny, Kira {{has been}} living in the secluded Marshall Islands {{since the end of the}} war within the country of Orb. He and Lacus have spent the past two years since the end of the war {{assisting}} Reverend Malchio and Kira's adoptive mother with their orphanage. When an incident triggers another war, Coordinators try to kill Lacus; Kira pilots Freedom to defeat them. When Orb attempts to join the war as a member of the Earth Alliance, Kira and the Arcangel intervene Orb's forces to preserve the nation's neutral status. Kira suspects Gilbert Durandal, the chairman of the PLANT colonies and leader of ZAFT, to be behind Lacus' attempted murder, but his motives are questioned by Athrun who is working in ZAFT. Later, when the Archangel becomes a target of the ZAFT ship known as Minerva, Kira is defeated and the Freedom is destroyed by pilot Shinn Asuka. Lacus gives Kira an upgraded version of Freedom, , so he can continue fighting. Having obtained <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> mass destruction, Durandal imposes the Destiny Plan, a rule which removes freewill and dictates a person's entire life based on their genetics. Kira, the Archangel and their allies confront ZAFT's forces in space and defeat them in the final battle. Kira personally confronts Durandal and the latter is killed by one of his own subordinates.|$|E
5|$|During another {{summer with}} his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, Harry Potter and Dudley are {{attacked}} by Dementors. After using magic to save Dudley and himself, Harry is expelled from Hogwarts, {{but the decision}} is later rescinded. Harry is whisked off {{by a group of}} wizards (including the real Mad-Eye Moody, Professor Lupin, and several new faces, including Nymphadora Tonks, a bubbly young witch who is a Metamorphmagus , and Kingsley Shacklebolt, a senior Auror who believes everyone is equal) to Number 12, Grimmauld Place, the former home of his godfather, Sirius Black. The building also serves as the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, of which Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Lupin, Mad-Eye, and Sirius are members. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger explain that the Order of the Phoenix is a secret organisation led by Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, dedicated to fighting Lord Voldemort and his followers, the Death Eaters. From the members of the Order, Harry and the others learn that Voldemort is seeking an object {{that he did not have}} prior to his first defeat, and assume this object to be <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> some sort. Harry learns that the Ministry of Magic, led by Cornelius Fudge, is refusing to acknowledge Voldemort's return because of the trouble that doing so would cause, and has been running a smear campaign against him and Dumbledore.|$|E

5|$|The other {{featured}} preliminary {{match was}} between Kane and Gene Snitsky. At Unforgiven, Shawn Michaels defeated Kane in a no disqualification match, a match where neither wrestler can be disqualified, allowing for weapons and outside interference. The next night on Raw, Kane demanded that authority figure Eric Bischoff, a portrayed match-maker and rule-enforcer, {{give him a}} rematch against Michaels, but Bischoff refused to do so as Michaels was preoccupied with appearing in Chris Jericho's interview segment, The Highlight Reel. Bischoff, however, scheduled Kane in a no disqualification match against an opponent of Bischoff's choice. Kane's opponent was revealed to be Gene Snistky. During the match, Kane's scripted wife, Lita, who was pregnant in the storyline, entered the ring. This led to Kane accidentally falling {{on top of her}} after Snitsky hit Kane with a steel chair, ending the match. Trainers and emergency medical technicians rushed to the scene and took Lita away in an ambulance for medical attention. The following week, Kane was informed by doctors that Lita suffered a scripted miscarriage following the events of the previous week. On the September 27 episode of Raw, in an interview with Todd Grisham, Kane informed Grisham that he sought revenge against Snitsky for his actions. The following week, Lita gave her first interview since the miscarriage and revealed that she and Kane would get payback against Snitsky. During the same episode, Snitsky was interviewed by Raw commentator Jim Ross and told Ross that the death of the couple's unborn child was not his fault. Kane interrupted the interview segment, but Snitsky attacked Kane with a lead pipe in self-defense. This led Bischoff to announce <b>a</b> <b>Weapon</b> <b>of</b> Choice match for Taboo Tuesday, where fans would be able to vote on whether a lead pipe, a steel chain, or a steel chair would be legal for use in the match.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} project analyzed {{the factors that}} make up <b>a</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> mass destruction site survey. The {{problem was that the}} Orlando Fire Department does not provide for the assessment of the threat against critical facilities and systems within our community. The purpose of the {{research project}} was to develop <b>a</b> <b>Weapons</b> <b>of</b> Mass Destruction Site Survey form to assist in identify potential terrorist target locations. The research employed action research (a) to determine what items {{should be included in the}} <b>Weapons</b> <b>of</b> Mass Destruction Site Survey, (b) what are the different types <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> mass destruction, (c) what is the best model to use for developing contingency plans for WMD events, (d) what are the obstacles to effective WMD readiness, (e) what can be done to effectively deter a terrorist organization from targeting a facility or structure within a community? The principle procedure employed was review of published materials and a survey of 100 local and national fire departments depicting their assessment of the terrorist threat against critical facilities and systems in their community. Data was compiled in graphic form to facilitate a comparison of published materials and contemporary fire department applications of assessing the terrorist threat. The major findings of this research were that few fire departments currently incorporate <b>a</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> mass destruction site survey into their preplanning operations. Principle among those factors was that only 9 % of surveyed departments even have a formal process in place for evaluating the <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> mass destruction potential to critical facilities within their communities...|$|R
