5|$|I am {{thinking}} this {{morning of the}} men in the mills and factories; I {{am thinking}} of the women who, for <b>a</b> <b>paltry</b> wage, are compelled to work out their lives; of the little children who, in this system, are robbed of their childhood, and in their early, tender years, are seized in the remorseless grasp of Mammon, and forced into the industrial dungeons, there to feed the machines while they themselves are being starved body and soul....|$|E
5|$|Sarah {{suggests}} that Hank and Jacob return <b>a</b> <b>paltry</b> {{sum of the}} money to the plane to avoid suspicion from local authorities. While travelling on foot to the woods, the brothers come across an old man on a snowmobile. Jacob, thinking that their cover is blown, bludgeons him. When the man regains consciousness, Hank suffocates him, then uses the snowmobile to drive his body off a bridge, making the murder look like an accidental death. The following night, Lou drunkenly demands some of the money from Hank, because he has spent recklessly since the discovery. When Hank refuses, Lou threatens to go to the authorities, having learned from Jacob about the old man's murder.|$|E
5|$|Sridhar remade {{the film}} in Hindi as Dil Ek Mandir (1963) and in Telugu as Manase Mandiram (1966). It was also remade in Malayalam as Hridayam Oru Kshethram and in Kannada as Kumkuma Rakshe (1977). California-based Indian filmmaker Jag Mundhra was keen on remaking Dil Ek Mandir in English and Hindi, effecting some {{marginal}} changes in the film treatment. Mundhra met Sridhar {{to ask for the}} rights to the film's script only to learn that Sridhar had assigned it to a film financier for <b>a</b> <b>paltry</b> sum, for eternity. The financier demanded an exorbitant fee for giving up the rights. The fee amounted to 75% of Mundhra's budget.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{contribution}} of agricultural sector to the state economy was on the decline in 2012–13, through {{the strength of the}} allied livestock sector, it has picked up from 7.03% (2011–12) to 7.2%. In the 2013–14 fiscal period, {{the contribution}} has been estimated at a high of 7.75%. The total growth of the farm sector has recorded a 4.39% increase in 2012–13, over <b>a</b> <b>paltry</b> 1.3% growth in the previous fiscal year. The agricultural sector has a share of 9.34% in the sectoral distribution of Gross State Domestic Product at Constant Price, while the secondary and tertiary sectors has contributed 23.94% and 66.72% respectively.|$|E
5|$|Again {{following}} {{the pattern of}} 2010, Roche also rode the Vuelta as Ag2r's squad leader. He hoped to improve upon both his dismal Tour, which he admitted was hampered by a crash sustained shortly beforehand at the Critérium du Dauphiné, and his seventh overall in the 2010 Vuelta. Their performance in the third Grand Tour team time trial of the season was even worse than the first two, as they were <b>a</b> <b>paltry</b> 19th of 22, immediately putting Roche 42 seconds off the pace. Roche led the peloton {{across the finish line}} in stage 3, but since it was for fifth place after breakaway riders took all the time bonuses, it had no substantial effect on his overall placing. Roche showed strongly on the Valdepeñas de Jaén climb in stage 5, finishing just 7 seconds behind stage winner Joaquim Rodríguez. However, since this final climb was rather short, time gaps were small throughout the field, and this performance only gained Roche one place in the overall standings, moving him up to 25th. Stage 8 proved largely similar, as Rodríguez again won on a short, steep final climb, and Roche finished in the top ten on the day, 15 seconds back this time. He gained two places with this ride. Mondory contested two of the field sprints in the race's first week, but did not come particularly close to winning either, finishing eighth and then seventh in stages 2 and 7 respectively.|$|E
25|$|Primarily {{noted for}} his bowling prowess during early outings with the Dublin University XI, Gwynn took 44 wickets {{at an average}} of 8.14 in Trinity's annus mirabilis of 1893, a season which {{witnessed}} victories over Leicestershire, Oxford University, Warwickshire (dismissed for <b>a</b> <b>paltry</b> total of 15 runs) and a draw against Essex.|$|E
6000|$|Torrance smiled grimly. [...] "Yes. The State {{offered me}} <b>a</b> few <b>paltry</b> concessions, and <b>a</b> {{little of what}} was all mine by right. It didn't seem a fit thing to accept their charity. Well, you have beaten us, Larry." ...|$|R
50|$|Cotman died in July 1842, and {{was buried}} in the {{cemetery}} at St. John's Wood Chapel. All his works and collection of prints and books were sold by auction at Christie's, realising just over £525 - <b>a</b> relatively <b>paltry</b> sum.|$|R
60|$|Thirty {{per cent}} of fifty {{thousand}} dollars! Jimmy jingled the {{few pieces of}} silver remaining in his pocket. Fifteen thousand dollars! And here he had been walking his legs off and starving in a vain attempt to earn <b>a</b> few <b>paltry</b> dollars honestly.|$|R
25|$|Thankfully for the {{tourists}} Gloucestershire were even poorer. After an opening stand of 36 from Sadiq Mohammad and Andy Stovold, Max Walker and Mick Malone made short work of their batting line-up. It took the Australian opening pair just 22.5 overs to have Gloucestershire all out for <b>a</b> <b>paltry</b> 63. Walker took an impressive 7/19 off 11.5, and Malone, 3/43 off 11 overs.|$|E
25|$|The {{film was}} a box office flop, {{receiving}} many negative to mixed reviews from critics(see below). The film {{was released in}} theaters on September 23, 1983 and grossed $1.4 million on its opening weekend. It {{would go on to}} make <b>a</b> <b>paltry</b> $4.7 million in North America. The film was pulled from theaters after three weeks and all of the promotional ads pulled after one week.|$|E
25|$|Services set Rajasthan a 231-run target {{after being}} asked to bat in Secunderabad. While NB Singh claimed a four-for, Yashpal Singh 75 not out and Suraj Yadav's unbeaten 44 lower down the order. Rajat Paliwal then claimed two for 10 {{including}} the wicket of Dishant Yagnik after while Suraj and Diwesh Pathania too picked two wickets apiece to bowl Rajasthan out for <b>a</b> <b>paltry</b> 167 and claim victory.|$|E

60|$|It was a bribe of kings; it was <b>an</b> act, <b>paltry</b> and contemptible, {{that was}} demanded {{of me in}} return. Still I did not speak.

25|$|After that century, however, Wettimuny's Test form {{went the}} same way as his ODI form. Despite hitting two fifties, he had too many scores below 20, and the 12 Tests {{following}} the England tour only yielded 402 runs at an average of 19.14. Wettimuny never got into control of the pitches in his home country, as he averaged <b>a</b> <b>paltry</b> 18.19 with the bat at home – an average more usually associated with a bowling all-rounder – but 39.95 overseas.|$|E
25|$|Three ODIs in Ireland {{were planned}} (29, 31 July and 1 August), {{but only one}} was {{actually}} played - {{the other two were}} rained off. However, in the match that was played on 31 July, Australia beat the Irish women's cricket team by 240 runs, Karen Rolton and Lisa Sthalekar both making centuries as Australia made 295 for 3, and Cecelia Joyce top-scored for Ireland with <b>a</b> <b>paltry</b> 18 - Shelley Nitschke taking four for 15 as Ireland collapsed to 55 all out in 26 overs.|$|E
25|$|Sager {{began his}} career as a {{reporter}} for WXLT (now WWSB-Channel 40) in Sarasota, Florida. He worked as a radio news director in 1974, making $95 a week for his efforts, <b>a</b> <b>paltry</b> sum for which he was supplemented in part by his access to sports events. Sager was in Atlanta and dodged security to be on the field on April 8, 1974, when slugger Hank Aaron hit his record-breaking 715th home run—brashly seeking to interview the superstar at home plate amidst mass fan pandemonium.|$|E
6000|$|His palace was {{standing}} till very lately, a Gothic {{building of the}} [...] fourteenth century, of which Mr. Brown possesses a drawing.

50|$|This {{was just}} {{the first of several}} musical tours overseas. In 1955, Albanian {{impresario}} Ayden Leskoviku of the Balkan Record Company invited her to perform and record in Istanbul, the city where she was born. She eventually recorded about forty songs for Leskoviku, and received about $5,000 for them. Although this was <b>a</b> relatively <b>paltry</b> sum, she later claimed that her performance fees and tips were ten times that amount.|$|R
25|$|Setting Worcestershire <b>a</b> <b>paltry</b> 167 to win, Essex {{got off to}} a {{good start}} bowling, {{removing}} opener Stephen Peters for 0 and nightwatchman and wicketkeeper Jamie Pipe for 11 just before stumps, as Darren Gough and Dale Steyn took a wicket each for Essex. On the fourth day, however, Stephen Moore built on his good batting form after 246 against Derbyshire a week before, however, making 63 not out and pairing up with Graeme Hick (76 not out) for 146 runs to win the match with relative ease.|$|E
25|$|With <b>a</b> <b>paltry</b> $15.50 {{in working}} capital {{and access to}} free office space in Superior from a {{sympathetic}} local newspaper, the stores began pooling their wholesale orders under the CCE name. Establishment of the entity as a formal federation of cooperative stores soon followed, although the organization started small, with only a total of 15 cooperatives agreeing to join the entrerprise {{by the end of}} 1917. The combination of orders won the participants in the group quantity discounts in the prices of their necessary supplies and generated a profit for participants in 1917 of $268 on a capital investment of just $480.|$|E
25|$|Honours in {{this group}} went to South Africa, who started off against Northern Ireland. The Irish had reached 89/5 from 38.1 overs when it rained, and the Duckworth–Lewis method was used to {{calculate}} a target of 131 from 38 overs for the South Africans, who won by making 133/6. South Africa then bowled out Bangladesh for <b>a</b> <b>paltry</b> 79 and made 80/5 for a five-wicket victory, before rounding things off against Barbados. The Barbadians set a useful 254/6 (Wallace 74), but 71 from Kallis and 54 from Gibbs saw their opponents through to 257/6 with ten balls remaining.|$|E

60|$|There are {{few things}} in this world which are not {{somewhat}} mysterious, or that cannot be, by a peculiar combination of circumstances, more or less invested with mystery; and we hold {{it to be an}} unfair and <b>a</b> very <b>paltry</b> device on the part of an author to seek to mystify his readers by keeping them in unnecessary ignorance of that which is in itself simple and commonplace.|$|R

25|$|The Australian bowlers put {{themselves}} back in {{control on the}} third day. Butcher and Trescothick were both out early in the same over to Glenn McGrath. Hussain and John Crawley managed to stabilise the England innings and advanced steadily to 268 for 3. However, England lost their last six wickets for <b>a</b> <b>paltry</b> 57 runs as the tail collapsed around Crawley, leaving him on 69 not {{out at the end}} of the innings. Australia started their second innings positively but lost both Justin Langer and Ponting to Caddick by the end of the day. A solid partnership between Hayden and Damien Martyn saw each advance to 40 not out by the close.|$|E
25|$|In 1799, {{in nearby}} Cabarrus County, 12-year-old Conrad Reed found a 17-pound rock, which his family {{used as a}} doorstop. Three years later, a jeweler {{determined}} it was nearly solid gold, paying the family <b>a</b> <b>paltry</b> $3.50. The first documented gold find in the United States of any consequence set off the nation's first gold rush. Many veins of gold {{were found in the}} area throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, leading to the 1837 founding of the Charlotte Mint. North Carolina was the chief producer of gold in the United States until the Sierra Nevada find in 1848, although the volume mined in the Charlotte area was dwarfed by subsequent rushes.|$|E
25|$|Papua New Guinea {{subsided}} to 48/6 before 73 from {{number eight}} batsman Raki Ila restored some respectability; nevertheless their final total of 184 was not enough, 65 from opener Ricky Hill setting Bermuda {{on their way}} to a six-wicket triumph. 6-11 from slow left-armer Bharat Gohel resulted in Fiji's dismissal for <b>a</b> <b>paltry</b> 87 against Hong Kong, who won by seven wickets. Gibraltar were all out for 134 against the Dutch, who then launched an astonishing assault against the Gibraltarian bowling, reaching 137/2 from just 11 overs. Against Israel, the United States ran up 396/4 (Kamran Rasheed 143 not out, H Blackman 83, Shivnarine 66, K Lorick 50 not out) before Prabhudas took 4-34 as Israel slipped to 149 all out.|$|E
