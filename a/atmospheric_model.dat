The Naval Research Laboratory in Monterey, California, developed a global <b>atmospheric</b> <b>model</b> called Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS).

500|$|An <b>atmospheric</b> <b>model</b> is a {{computer}} program that produces meteorological information for future times at given locations and altitudes. [...] Within any modern model {{is a set of}} equations, known as the primitive equations, used to predict the future state of the atmosphere. [...] These equations—along with the ideal gas law—are used to evolve the density, pressure, and potential temperature scalar fields and the air velocity (wind) vector field of the atmosphere through time. Additional transport equations for pollutants and other aerosols are included in some primitive-equation high-resolution models as well. The equations used are nonlinear partial differential equations which are impossible to solve exactly through analytical methods, {{with the exception of a}} few idealized cases. Therefore, numerical methods obtain approximate solutions. [...] Different models use different solution methods: some global models and almost all regional models use finite difference methods for all three spatial dimensions, while other global models and a few regional models use spectral methods for the horizontal dimensions and [...] finite-difference methods in the vertical.|$|E
500|$|Studies have {{evaluated}} {{that global}} warming can result in higher observed intensities of tropical cyclones {{as a result of}} deviations in the surface energy flux and atmospheric composition, which both heavily influence the development of medicanes as well. In tropical and subtropical areas, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) rose [...] within a 50-year period, and in the North Atlantic and Western Pacific tropical cyclone basins, the potential destructiveness and energy of storms nearly doubled within the same duration, evidencing a clear correlation between global warming and tropical cyclone intensities. Within a similarly recent 20-year period, SSTs in the Mediterranean Sea increased by , though no observable increase in medicane activity has been noted, as of yet. In 2006, a computer-driven <b>atmospheric</b> <b>model</b> evaluated the future frequency of Mediterranean cyclones between 2071 and 2100, projecting a decrease in autumn, winter, and spring cyclonic activity coinciding with a dramatic increase in formation near Cyprus, with both scenarios attributed to elevated temperatures as a result of global warming. Other studies, however, have been inconclusive, forecasting both increases and decreases in duration, number, and intensity. Three independent studies, using different methodologies and data, evaluated that while medicane activity would likely decline with a rate depending on the climate scenario considered, a higher percentage of those that formed would be of greater strength.|$|E

2500|$|This <b>atmospheric</b> <b>model</b> assumes both {{molecular}} weight and temperature are constant {{over a wide}} range of altitude. Such a model may be called isothermal (constant temperature). Inserting constant {{molecular weight}} and constant temperature into the equation for the ideal gas law produces the result that density and pressure, the two remaining variables, depend only on each other. [...] For this reason, this model may also be called barotropic (density depends only on pressure).|$|E
2500|$|The {{effective}} temperature {{of a star}} can be approximated from the colour, {{but this is not}} very accurate and spectral fitting to an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>model</b> is necessary to derive the temperature. [...] Temperatures of 53,000 K - 56,000 K are found for R136a1 using different atmospheric models. [...] Older models had produced temperatures around 45,000 K and hence dramatically lower luminosities. [...] The extreme temperature of the star causes its peak radiation to be around 50nm and nearly 99% of the radiation to be emitted outside the visual range (a bolometric correction around 5).|$|E
2500|$|The NASA Earth Global Reference <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Model</b> (Earth-GRAM) was {{developed}} by the Marshall Space Flight Center to provide a design reference atmosphere that, unlike the standard atmospheres, allows for geographical variability, a wide range of altitudes (surface to orbital altitudes), and different months and times of day. [...] It can also simulate spatial and temporal perturbations in atmospheric parameters due to turbulence and other atmospheric perturbation phenomena. [...] It is available in computer code written in FORTRAN. [...] The GRAM series also includes atmospheric models for the planets Venus, Mars and Neptune and the Saturnian moon, Titan.|$|E

2500|$|An <b>atmospheric</b> <b>model</b> is a {{mathematical}} model constructed around the full set of primitive dynamical equations which govern atmospheric motions. It can supplement these equations with parameterizations for turbulent diffusion, radiation, moist processes (clouds and precipitation), heat exchange, soil, vegetation, surface water, the kinematic effects of terrain, and convection. Most atmospheric models are numerical, i.e. they discretize equations of motion. They can predict microscale phenomena such as tornadoes and boundary layer eddies, sub-microscale turbulent flow over buildings, as well as synoptic and global flows. The horizontal domain of a model is either global, covering the entire Earth, or regional (limited-area), covering {{only part of the}} Earth. [...] The different types of models run are thermotropic, barotropic, hydrostatic, and nonhydrostatic. [...] Some of the model types make assumptions about the atmosphere which lengthens the time steps used and increases computational speed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sea state}} is {{described}} as a spectrum; the sea surface can be decomposed into waves of varying frequencies using the principle of superposition. The waves are also separated by their direction of propagation. The model domain size can range from regional to the global ocean. [...] Smaller domains can be nested within a global domain to provide higher resolution in a region of interest. [...] The sea state evolves according to physical equations – based on a spectral representation of the conservation of wave action – which include: wave propagation / advection, refraction (by bathymetry and currents), shoaling, and a source function which allows for wave energy to be augmented or diminished. [...] The source function has at least three terms: wind forcing, nonlinear transfer, and dissipation by whitecapping. Wind data are typically provided from a separate <b>atmospheric</b> <b>model</b> from an operational weather forecasting center.|$|E
