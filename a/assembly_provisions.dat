Industries that {{engage in this}} pattern of trade are identified through their use of offshore <b>assembly</b> <b>provisions</b> in the US tariff code. Findings explain why industries engage in vertical specialization-based trade and shed light on factors that enter production location decisions. Identifying factors that encourage vertical specialization-based production and trade will enhance our understanding of industry strategy and how trade patterns will evolve as the process of globalization continues. Results suggest vertical specialization-based trade {{will continue to grow}} relative to total trade. Vertical specialization, production sharing, offshore <b>assembly</b> <b>provisions,...</b>|$|E

Overseas <b>Assembly</b> <b>Provisions.</b> Three findings emerge. First, firms reduce their use of foreign parts and assembly when foreign costs rise, but only with a lag. In contrast, recent foreign cost increases boost the foreign portion of final product value. Second, the effects of cost changes are more pronounced for U. S. outsourcing imports from developing countries. Finally, the degree of production responsiveness differs with industry capital intensity and is the greatest for low-capital intensity projects performed in non-Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) locations.

40|$|This paper investigates {{whether the}} cost of {{environmental}} regulation influences the international location of polluting industries. Industries that operate production facilities in developing countries are identified through {{their use of the}} offshore <b>assembly</b> <b>provisions</b> in the U. S. tariff Code. Pollutions Intensity of industry output is found to significantly reduce the probability of conducting offshore assembly in developing countries. This finding contradicts the arguments that developing countries are becoming pollution havens as a result of offshore assembly independent of their general disregard for the environment. Integrating production across national boundaries might actually enhance worldwide environmental quality. Relatively clean stages of the production process are being transferred to developing countries with lax environmental regulations, while polluting segments remain in the U. S. where strict environmental controls are enforced. [F 1, Q 2]...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between geographical distance and both the extent of trade and foreign production. Industries engaged in exporting and co-production activities across national boundaries are identified through {{their use of the}} Offshore <b>Assembly</b> <b>Provisions</b> in the US tariff code. Findings counter conventional wisdom. Trade and foreign production activities are found to drop off rapidly over the first third of the distance scale, rise over the middle portion, reach a peak in the final third, and decline thereafter. This pattern suggests frictions associated with distance can be offset by government policies and other country attributes. Management control, information and communications costs, and the ability to implement just-in-time delivery strategies may not be as distance sensitive as previously thought. Theorists should re-evaluate the role of distance in trade models and refrain from using distance as a proxy for transport costs.

40|$|The {{structure}} of a legal state in principle {{is a way to}} create a complex legal system, to realize the legal order that governs the relationship between the communities by the state or state institutions in a region or country. Hans Kelsen in his book entitled "General Theory of Law and state" suggests a theory known as the "Stufen theory". In the essence of this theory assert legal hierarchical, structured shows that law subordinate must not conflict with the law who are in it or a higher degree. Historical development hierarchy Laws and Regulations in Indonesia started since 1966 in the form back to the Regulation of Legislation No. 12 in 2011.

40|$|M. B. A. According to du Plessis et al., (1994 : 67), {{the history}} of {{protectionism}} in trade goes almost {{as far back as}} that of trade itself. There are various arguments for the numerous benefits, which can be gained from free trade such as, efficiency and welfare gains. But, despite these benefits, governments have had counter arguments as to why protectionism is justified. Examples of these traditional arguments for protection are, the infant industry argument, the terms of trade argument, protection to increase employment in an industry, a tariff to offset foreign dumping and a tariff to improve the balance of payments. All of these arguments have important gains for the protected economy but could be considered beggar-thyneighbour policies since they are {{at the expense of the}} unprotected economy. Various trade instruments are used by governments to intervene in its countries trading activities. These trade instruments are categorised into, tariff, non-tariff barriers and export taxes and subsidies. Both tariff and non-tariff barriers are used to interfere on the import side of trade, whereas export subsidies and taxes are used to interfere with the free flow of exports. Tariff barriers include specific tariffs, ad valorem tariffs, import subsidies, preferential duties, most-favoured nation treatment and offshore <b>assembly</b> <b>provisions.</b> Nontariff barriers include import quotas, "voluntary" export restraints, government procurement provisions, local content provisions, administrative classification and restriction on service trade (du Plessis et al., 1994 : 67 - 70). An example of a protected industry in South Africa is the motor industry. The initial protectionist programmes used by the motor industry were characterised by local content policies. These programmes resulted in a heavily protected motor and component industry. In recent years, policymakers have attempted to reduce the level of protection in the industry through the Motor Industry Development Programme (MIDP), in line with the General Trade and Tariff Agreement (GATT). This programme is not only attempting to reduce the use of trade instruments but, also to become globally competitive. This dissertation attempts to evaluate the effects that protectionism, in the form of the Motor Industry Development Programme, has had on the Motor Industry's component suppliers...|$|E

The first portion of the thesis notes {{the importance of the}} maquiladora program (the OAP in Mexico) to the Mexican economy and, because of the relatively large size of the U. S. economy, the small impact on the U. S. Also, the maquiladora plants have very low linkages into the Mexican economy, i. e. few nonlabor inputs come from Mexico. The second portion of the thesis is a literature review which discloses the result that a hypothetical repeal of the OAP results in a small loss of welfare in the U. S., a small gain in U. S. employment, and a small loss in employment in Mexico. The third portion uses input-output analysis to discover that maquiladoras provide a very small portion of the expansion of Mexican exports since 1980...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{examine how}} the growth of {{offshore}} assembly in Mexico has affected manufacturing activity in U. S. border cities. Under the offshore <b>assembly</b> <b>provision</b> of the U. S. tariff schedule, goods that are assembled abroad using U. S. -manufactured components receive preferential tariff treatment upon reentry into the United States. Foreign assembly plants in Mexico, {{most of which are}} owned by U. S. -based multinationals, are overwhelmingly concentrated along the border with the United States. I combine data on employment and earnings in two-digit manufacturing industries for U. S. border cities with data on employment and value added in foreign assembly plants in the corresponding Mexican border cities. I study the effect that the expansion of offshore assembly in a Mexican border city has on durable and nondurable manufacturing activities in the neighboring U. S. border city. The estimation results show strong support for the hypothesis that the growth of export assembly in Mexico increases the demand for manufacturing goods produced in U. S. border cities. Implications of the North American Free Trade Agreement for the U. S. -Mexico border region are discussed. ...|$|R

5|$|In the 1792 constitution, the {{governor}} and state senators were chosen by electors, {{in a manner similar}} to the operation of the United States Electoral College. In the 1795 gubernatorial election, Benjamin Logan received 21 electoral votes, James Garrard received 17, Thomas Todd received 14, and John Brown received 1. The constitution did not specify whether election required a plurality or a majority of the electoral votes cast; in the absence of any instruction, the electors held a runoff vote, wherein most of Todd's electors voted for Garrard, giving him a majority. The secretary of state certified Garrard's election, though Attorney General John Breckinridge questioned the legality of the second vote and Logan formally protested it. Ultimately, Breckinridge determined that he was not empowered by the state constitution to intervene, and Logan gave up the challenge.
