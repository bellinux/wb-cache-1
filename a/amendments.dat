5|$|Even {{after the}} {{election}} of Abraham Lincoln as president in 1860, Crittenden rejected the idea that secession was inevitable and continued {{to work for the}} preservation of the Union. He believed that the current sectional crisis could—like all past disagreements in U.S. history—be resolved through compromise. However, he believed that this compromise must not be a simple legislative action, which could be altered or even repealed by a successive Congress, but <b>amendments</b> to the U.S. Constitution, which would be much more difficult to change. To that end, he proposed the Crittenden Compromise—a package of six constitutional <b>amendments</b> and four congressional resolutions—in December 1860. Among the resolutions were a condemnation of Northern personal liberty laws and an assertion of the constitutionality of the fugitive slave law. The <b>amendments</b> would have restored the Missouri Compromise line and extended it to California as a line of demarcation between slave and free territories. Crittenden's other <b>amendments</b> would have further guaranteed that slavery would remain legal indefinitely in Washington, D.C., so long as it was legal in either Maryland or Virginia and that slaveholders would be reimbursed for runaway slaves. Also, the <b>amendments</b> denied Congress any power to interfere with the interstate slave trade or with slavery in the existing Southern states and made the fugitive slave law and Three-Fifths Compromise perpetual in duration.|$|E
