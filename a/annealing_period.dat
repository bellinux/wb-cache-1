40|$|The {{behaviour}} of the leakage current, interstrip {{resistance and}} capacitance {{have been studied}} on silicon microstrip detectors during an <b>annealing</b> <b>period</b> equivalent to similar or equal to 10 (8) min at room temperature, after 34 MeV proton irradiation. A comparison between samples of the same geometry built on and substrates with different resistivity has been carried out. The samples were irradiated at 4 different fluences up to 1 X 10 (14) p/cm(2). After the irradiation the measurements were performed at room temperature and after heating the samples at 60 degreesC, 80 degreesC and 120 degreesC to cover the complete annealing curve. The leakage current shows the same annealing behaviour typical of a simple diode. The interstrip resistance measured at full depletion voltage (V-dep) decreases in all structures, going down to few tens of MOmega at the highest fluence. It remains practically constant during the <b>annealing</b> <b>period.</b> The interstrip capacitance (at V-dep) varies during the <b>annealing</b> <b>period</b> with the same behaviour in both substrates {{and for all the}} fluence values: it decreases during the annealing at room temperature, reaching a minimum value, and increases after each heat treatment.

In addition, we demonstrate that microstructural features that are not traditionally affected by nucleating agents, such as the orientation of crystals, can be tuned with the crystallization temperature applied.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{vanishing}} fiber diameter model {{together with}} the thermoviscoplastic-ity theory based on overstress including a recovery of state formulation is introduced. They are employed to analyze the effects of temperature rate and of annealing at constant temperature on the residual stresses at room temperature when unidirectional fibrous metal-matrix composites are cooled down from 1000 &deg;C during the manufacturing process. For the present analysis the fibers {{are assumed to be}} transversely isotropic thermoelastic and the matrix constitutive equation is isotropic thermoviscoplastic including recovery of state. All material functions and constants can depend on current temperature. Yield sur-faces and loading/unloading conditions are not used in the theory in which the inelastic strain rate is solely a function of the overstress, the difference between stress and the equi-librium stress, a state variable of the theory. Assumed but realistic material elastic and vis-coplastic properties as a function of temperature which are close to W/ 9 Cr-lMo steel com-posite permit the computation of residual stresses. Due to the viscoplasticity of the matrix time-dependent effects such as creep and change of residual stresses with time are found. It is found that the residual stresses at room temperature change considerably with temper-ature history. The matrix residual stress, upon reaching room temperature, is highest for the fastest cooling rate, but after 30 days rest the influence of cooling rate is hardly notice-able since relaxation takes place. <b>Annealing</b> <b>periods</b> can reduce the residual stresses com-pared to continuous cooling...|$|R

Polymer-ceramic composites {{are considered to be}} one possible solution towards the fabrication of high energy density capacitors, whether as embedded capacitors or gate insulators in organic field effect transistors (OFETs). Selecting high permittivity ceramics mixed with polymers with high breakdown field strengths would be the wisest approach towards enhancing energy storage. As such, novel ferroelectric polymers such as P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) are being developed and researched, all displaying record dielectric values (K > 50) as promising candidates for high energy density composite capacitors (> 25 J/cm 3). However, much work is still needed to understand the interaction mechanisms between the phases. We aim to seek an understanding of the processing challenges, especially in terms of fabricating thin film ferroelectric polymers and their application in nanocomposite capacitors while effectively maintaining optimized performance when embedded in flexible electronics. A process for synthesizing high performance P(VDF-TrFE) thin films is developed realizing the importance of controlling several process parameters to achieve high quality devices. Electrical and physicochemical characterization demonstrate how the performance of the polymer films improves with prolonged <b>annealing</b> <b>periods</b> by allowing sufficient time for solvent evaporation, crystallization and preferential-orientation of the crystallites.

40|$|The {{chemical}} and physical aging of aluminum(III) 8 -hydroxyquinoline (Alq 3) films was studied {{by a variety}} of techniques. The products of these mechanisms produce electron trap states below the conduction band, or lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level (LUMO), of Alq 3. The distribution of these trap states was shown to affect the charge transport and luminescence characteristics of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on this material. ^ The chief route of chemical decomposition is the substitution of water with one of the ligands of Alq 3. This reaction was characterized by gas chromatography, and quantitative kinetics were obtained to measure the impact of chemical aging in real device architectures. Electrochemical reduction of either Alq 3 or the free ligand, 8 -hydroxyquinoline (Hq), facilitates dissociation of the complex, especially when oxygen is present. The reduced form of Hq is unstable and forms quinones, hydroquinones, and charge transfer complexes, the latter of which will cause an additional loss in the performance of OLEDs due to luminescence quenching. This instability is particularly important because Hq traps electrons during device operation. ^ Physical aging and crystallization were observed by X-ray diffraction, calorimetry, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Films which were amorphous upon deposition, crystallized rapidly upon annealing at temperatures below their glass transition. Blends of Alq 3 with aluminum(III) 5 -methyl- 8 -hydroxyquinoline were proposed for thermally stable amorphous emitting layers in OLEDs.

The RE texture emerges during the nucleation of recrystallised grains and is maintained during subsequent uniform grain growth, which results in a stable RE texture being developed as recrystallisation progresses. The uniform grain growth could be attributed to solute drag suppressing the grain boundary mobility of those grains that had recrystallised with a basal texture and precipitate pinning restricting potential orientated grain growth...|$|E
40|$|Highly {{polycrystalline}} {{and pure}} delafossite phase CuAlO 2 powder has been synthesised {{within a short}} <b>annealing</b> <b>period,</b> shorter than most conventional processes. This is an improvement over the conventional synthesis procedures. The conventional synthesis procedure has seen CuAlO 2 only formed at high annealing temperatures ≥ 1100 °C over long annealing time, some as long as 96 hours. In the current process, a pure phase devoid of impurities has been obtained at a reduced calcination time of 1. 5 hours in an argon atmosphere at a temperature of 1150 °C. This was confirmed by XRD and SEM/EDX. High temperature DC/AC electrical measurements show {{a change in the}} conduction mechanism from mixed conductivity (ionic + p-type) in the temperature range of 375 ≥ T ≥ 25 °C to intrinsic type behavior above 375 °C. The activation energies for these two regimes are 0. 27 eV and 0. 08 eV respectively. This change from mixed to p-type conductivity is confirmed by spectral analysis also. Spectral analysis using the power law also revealed that conduction is of long range hopping. The use of platinum as a contact electrode at elevated temperatures has a detrimental effect on the electrical properties since it encourages the formation of CuAl 2 O 4 at the interface due to the formation of a more stable Cu–Pt alloy by virtue of the chemical reaction Image Pt+ 2 CuAlO 2 →CuAl 2 O 4 +PtCu...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMagnetic {{iron oxide}} (Fe 3 O 4 and γ-Fe 2 O 3) and iron carbide (Fe 3 C) {{nanoparticles}} of different geometrical shapes: cubes, spheres, rods and plates, {{have been prepared}} by thermal decomposition of a mixture containing the metal precursor Fe(CO) 5 and the stabilizer polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) at 300 1 C in a sealed cell under inert atmosphere. The thermal decomposition process was performed for 4 or 24 h at ([PVP]/[Fe(CO) 5]) (w/v) ratio of 1 : 1 or 1 : 5. Elemental iron nanospheres embedded within a mixture of amorphous and graphitic carbon coating were obtained by hydrogen reduction of the prepared iron oxide and iron carbide nanoparticles at 450 1 C. The formation of the graphitic carbon phase at such a low temperature is unique and probably obtained by catalysis of the elemental iron nanoparticles. Changing the <b>annealing</b> time <b>period</b> and the ([PVP]/[Fe(CO) 5]) ratio allowed control of the composition, size, size distribution, crystallinity, geometrical shape and magnetic properties of the different magnetic nanoparticles...|$|R
40|$|Contact {{structures}} using contact materials Au, Ge and Pd on n-type GaAs were metallized, {{formed and}} studied. The transfer characteristics, namely contact resistivity (ρc), for the structures {{was assessed using}} transmission line model. The {{results showed that the}} structures under appropriate <b>annealing</b> conditions (<b>period</b> and temperature) exhibit ohmic behaviour with low contact resistivity ρc (~ 10 - 6 Ω cm 2). It was found that ρc decreases with increasing annealing temperature up to ~ 180 0 C. The ρc was also found to decrease with increasing substrate-doping density. The contact formation mechanism for the structures Au/Ge/Pd was also studied by a compositional analysis. The compositional distribution in metallization was investigated by collecting the Rutherford 2. 3 MeV 4 He++ backscattering spectra for the as-deposited structures and the structures after annealed. The results supported the Au-Ge inter-diffusion mechanism. However, the factors which were crucially responsible for the Au/Ge/Pd transparent-contacts with low contact resistance are the solid-phase regrowth, inter-diffusion between Au and Ge, and the enhancement of the conductivity of the excess Ge due to the incorporation of Au...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Changes in the structural, magnetic, {{and optical}} {{properties}} are observed during {{the synthesis of}} metallic nanoclusters fabricated {{on the surface of}} a thin silica layer by ion beam implantation of iron atoms. Iron atoms were implanted to the fluence of 1016 cm- 2. The ion implantation depth in 400 -nm thick Si 02 film on a Si ((100) substrate was 25 nm. The implanted samples were subsequently <b>annealed</b> for <b>periods</b> of seconds to hours at 1000 C with Electron Beam Annealing. Ellipsometry and Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry spectra were fitted with appropriate models to retrieve the optical characteristics, composition, and structure of the samples. Magneto Optical Kerr Effect measurements and SQUID magnetometry were performed to investigate the effect of the structural changes identified by TEM measurements on the superparamagnetic and magneto-optical properties of the samples during the annealing process. The changes in the Fe crystalline(core) /amorphous oxide(shell) structure and the position of the nanoclusters relative to the surface observed for small annealing durations are shown to enhance the Kerr effect resulting into high coercive field and high amplitude in the Kerr rotation and ellipticity...|$|R
