40|$|In this study, {{change in}} {{rheological}} and nanomechanical properties of asphalt due to aging is determined in the laboratory. Asphalt binders are aged using Rolling Thin Film Oven (RTFO), Pressure Aging Vessel (PAV), and draft ovens. Asphalt binder includes an unmodified base binder, Styrene-Butadiene (SB) and Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene (SBS) polymer modified binders. Rheological properties such as viscosity, phase angle, shear modulus, creep compliance, stiffness, etc. are determined using Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) test, Multiple Stress Creep Recovery (MSCR) test, Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR) test, Rotational Viscosity (RV) {{test and the}} Direct Tension (DT) test. Nanomechanical properties such as hardness and reduced elastic modulus are determined using a nanoindenter. Laboratory test results are {{expressed in terms of}} Aging Index (AI) defined by relative change in specific rheological or nanomechanical property of aged and unaged binder. As it was expected, binder rheological properties such as stiffness increases and phase angle and creep compliance decrease due to aging. Based on aging index defined by complex shear modulus (G*), increase in percentage of polymer results in decrease in the AI value for both SB and SBS modified binder. It means percent increase of polymer is not good for long term stability but may be good for fatigue. When comparing AI defined by G* of SB and SBS, it is shown that SBS has higher AI than SB. Aging index of RTFO condition binder does not vary as significantly as it varies in PAV conditioned sample. When comparing AI defined by G*, elastic modulus (G'), viscous modulus (G″), of oven aged sample, base binder ages more than modified binder and G' changes exponentially compared to the linear change of G″. At low temperature, the difference in creep compliance of unaged and aged binder is small compared to that at high temperature. This confirms that temperature significantly affects aging. Based on AI defined by BBR stiffness, original binder shows AI value similar to the modified binder. Again, SBS has higher AI defined BBR stiffness than SB. Based on ductility measured in DT test, it can be said as sample ages its ductility reduces. Nanoindentation is conducted on thin <b>asphalt</b> binder film <b>deposited</b> on glass slides. For both unmodified and modified binders, hardness and reduce modulus increase exponentially due to aging. Nanoindentation results show similar trend obtained by rheological test.

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{patterns in}} the distribution of intact polar membrane lipids (IPLs) in the marine environment. IPL analysis is a relatively new tool in microbial ecology to study (i) live microbial biomass and (ii) the dominating microbial players. This technique was applied {{for the first time to}} study the oxic and anoxic water column of the Black Sea and observed a stratification of IPLs according to geochemical zonation. Export of IPLs to the sediment was found to be selective and the distribution of IPLs in the upper 2 cm of the sediments reflects de novo production of IPLs by indigenous microbes, putatively identified as sulfate-reducing bacteria and benthic archaea. The distribution of archaeal IPLs in the anoxic water body did not indicate the abundant presence of methanotrophic archaea, which were presumed in earlier studies due to high estimated methane oxidation rates. The presence of betaine lipids and glycosidic sphingolipids in the anoxic water column could be linked to unknown anaerobic bacteria and is a novel finding as these lipids are primarily known to be produced by eukaryotes. Investigations of microbial communities associated to the Chapopote asphalt seep in the southern Gulf of Mexico revealed the presence of a diverse array of IPLs from both Bacteria and Archaea. IPL concentrations in the sediments were correlated with the abundant presence of oil and methane, indicating that the petroleum hydrocarbons are a major stimulant for microbial activity. Bacterial IPL concentrations decreased with decreasing sulfate concentrations over depth, whereas archaeal IPLs increased simultaneously and comprised up to 80 % of total IPLs at ca. 15 cm sediment depth. Bacterial lipids mainly included phospholipids with the polar head groups phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidyl-(N) -methylethanolamine (PME), and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). The assignment of these IPLs to sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) was confirmed by the presence of SRB-characteristic fatty acids. Polar head group-specific isotope analysis of the SRB core lipids revealed that the majority of the SRB population is autotrophic and involved in the anaerobic oxidation of methane. However, a large amount of SRB are heterotrophic hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria. The oil-degrading bacteria mainly contained PME as head group. Archaeal IPLs indicated the presence of ANME- 1 archaea comprised of diglycosidic glyceroldibiphytanylglyceroltetraethers (2 Gly-GDGT) accompanied by ANME- 2 archaea suggested by phosphate-based hydroxyarchaeols. Polar head group-specific stable carbon isotope analysis of the archaeal IPLs confirmed the association of those lipids to methanotrophic archaea and could also show that phosphate-based archaeols and GDGTs with mixed glycosidic and phosphate-based head groups were mainly derived from methanogenic archaea. In subsurface sediments of the oil-influenced Chapopote asphalt seep abundant archaeal IPLs were detected close to a sulfate-methane transition zone. Here, bacterial lipids were only a minor part of the total IPLs and were dominated by diether lipids with PE headgroups. Phosphate-based hydroxyarchaeols and diglycosidic GDGTs could be assigned to both methanogenic and methanotrophic sources. Methane is thus a major intermediate in microbial metabolism at the Chapopote asphalt volcano. Investigations of biological and physical weathering of the <b>deposited</b> <b>asphalts</b> showedthat the asphalts are an important substrate for the microbial community. The removal of n-alkanes, branched alkanes, isoprenoids and low molecular weight polyaromatic hydrocarbon compounds could be primarily assigned to biodegradation. Biomarkers such as steranes and hopanes were most recalcitrant and were still observed in highly weathered brittle asphalts. Comparison of fresh and weathered asphalts allowed to estimate total petroleum hydrocarbon losses into the environment. Assessment of the potential of total hydrocarbon emission from the Chapopote asphalt seep amounts to up to 1, 540 Ã Â± 770 tons. However, there is indication that a large fraction of these hydrocarbons are already efficiently recycled by the indigenous microorganisms associated to the asphalts...|$|R

40|$|Following the {{discovery}} of asphalt volcanism in the Campeche Knolls a research cruise {{was carried out in}} 2006 to unravel the nature of the <b>asphalt</b> <b>deposits</b> at Chapopote. The novel results support the concept that the <b>asphalt</b> <b>deposits</b> at the seafloor in 3000 m of water depth originate from the seepage of heavy petroleum with a density slightly greater than water. The released petroleum forms characteristic flow structures at the seafloor with surfaces that are 'ropy' or 'rough' similar to magmatic lava flows. The surface structures indicate that the viscosity of the heavy petroleum rapidly increases after extrusion due to loss of volatiles. Consequently, the heavy petroleum forms the observed asphalt deposit and solidifies. Detailed survey with a remotely operated vehicle revealed that the asphalts are subject to sequential alterations: e. g. volume reduction leading to the formation of visible cracks in the asphalt surface, followed by fragmentation of the entire deposit. While relatively fresh asphalt samples were gooey and sticky, older, fragmented pieces were found to be brittle without residual stickiness. Furthermore, there is evidence for petroleum seepage from below the <b>asphalt</b> <b>deposits,</b> leading to local up-doming and, sometimes, to whip-shaped extrusions. Extensive mapping by TV-guided tools of Chapopote Asphalt Volcano indicates that the main <b>asphalt</b> <b>deposits</b> occur at the south-western rim that borders a central, crater-like depression. The most recent asphalt deposit at Chapopote is the main asphalt field covering an area of ~ 2000 m** 2. Asphalt volcanism is distinct from oil and gas seepage previously described in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere because it is characterized by episodic intrusions of semi-solid hydrocarbons that spread laterally over a substantial area and produce structures with significant vertical relief. As Chapopote occurs at the crest of a salt structure it is inferred that asphalt volcanism is a secondary result of salt tectonism...|$|E
40|$|Natural <b>asphalt</b> (or bitumen) <b>deposits,</b> {{oil seepage}} and liquid oil shows are {{widespread}} in the Middle East, especially in the Zagros mountains of Iran. Ancient people from northern Iraq, south-west Iran and the Dead Sea area extensively used this ubiquitous natural resource until the Neolithic period (7000 to 6000 BC). Evidence of earlier use has been recently documented in the Syrian desert near El Kown, where bitumen-coated flint implements, dated to 40, 000 BC (Mousterian period), have been unearthed. This discovery at least proves that bitumen was used by Neanderthal populations as hafting material to fix handles to their flint tools. Numerous testimonies, proving {{the importance of this}} petroleum-based material in Ancient civilizations, were brought to light by the excavations conducted in the Near East as of the beginning of the century. Bitumen remains show a wide range of uses that can be classified under several headings. First of all, bitumen was largely used in Mesopotamia and Elam as mortar in the construction of palaces (e. g. the Darius Palace in Susa), temples, ziggurats (e. g. the so-called 'Tower of Babel' in Babylon), terraces (e. g. the famous 'Hanging Gardens of Babylon') and exceptionally for roadway coating (e. g. the processional way of Babylon). Since the Neolithic, bitumen served to waterproof containers (baskets, earthenware jars, storage pits), wooden posts, palace grounds (e. g. in Mari and Haradum), reserves of lustral waters, bathrooms, palm roofs, etc. Mats, sarcophagi, coffins and jars, used for funeral practices, were often covered and sealed with bitumen. Reed and wood boats were also caulked with bitumen. Abundant lumps of bituminous mixtures used for that particular purpose have been found in storage rooms of houses at Ra's al-Junayz in Oman. Bitumen was also a widespread adhesive in antiquity and served to repair broken ceramics, fix eyes and horns on statues (e. g. at Tell al-Ubaid around 2500 BC). Beautiful decorations with stones, shells, mother of pearl, on palm trees, cups, ostrich eggs, musical instruments (e. g. the Queen's lyre) and other items, such as rings, jewellery and games, have been excavated from the Royal tombs in Ur. They are on view in the British Museum. With a special enigmatic material, commonly referred to as 'bitumen mastic', the inhabitants of Susa sculpted masterpieces of art which are today exhibited in the Louvre Museum in Paris. This unique collection is presented in a book by Connan and Deschesne (1996). Last, bitumen was also considered as a powerful remedy in medical practice, especially as a disinfectant and insecticide, and was used by the ancient Egyptians to prepare mixtures to embalm the corpses of their dead. Modern analytical techniques, currently applied in the field of petroleum geochemistry, have been adapted to the study of numerous archaeological bituminous mixtures found in excavations. More than 700 bituminous samples have been analysed during the last decade, using gas chromatography alone and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and isotopic chemistry (carbon and hydrogen mainly). These powerful tools, focused on the detailed analysis of biomarkers in hydrocarbon fractions, were calibrated on various well-known natural sources of bitumen in Iraq, Syria, Iran, Bahrain and Kuwait. These reference studies have made it possible to establish the origins of bitumen from numerous archaeological sites and to document the bitumen trade routes in the Middle East and the Arabo-Persian Gulf. Using a well-documented case history, Tell el 'Oueili (5800 to 3500 BC) in South Mesopotamia, we will illustrate in this paper how these new molecular and isotopic tools can help us to recognize different sources of bitumen and to trace the ancient trade routes through time. These import routes were found to vary with major cultural and political changes in the area under study. A second example, referring to the prehistoric period, describes bitumen traces on flint implements, dated from Mousterian times. This discovery, from the Umm El Tlel excavations near El Kown in Syria, was reported in 1996 in Boëda et al. At that time, the origin of the bitumen had not been elucidated due to contamination problems. Last year, a ball of natural oil-stained sands, unearthed from the same archaeological layer, allowed us to determine the source of the bitumen used. This source is regional and located in the Jebel Bichri, nearly 40 km from the archaeological site. The last case history was selected to illustrate another aspect of the investigations carried out. Recent geochemical studies on more than 20 balms from Egyptian mummies from the Intermediate, Ptolemaic and Roman periods have revealed that these balms are composed of various mixtures of bitumen, conifer resins, grease and beeswax. Bitumen occurs with the other ingredients and the balms studied show a great variety of molecular compositions. Bitumen from the Dead Sea area is the most common source but some other sources (Hit in Iraq?) are also revealed by different molecular patterns. The absolute amount of bitumen in balms varies from almost zero to 30 % per weight...|$|R

In an attempt to test these hypotheses, a recently recovered Columbian mammoth (Mammu-thus columbi) skeleton with an unusual pattern of asphalt impregnation was studied. Ultimately, none of the bone samples tested successfully amplified M. columbi DNA. Our work suggests that reagents typically used to remove asphalt from ancient samples also inhibit DNA extraction. Ultimately, we con-clude that the probability of recovering ancient DNA from fossils in <b>asphalt</b> <b>deposits</b> is strongly (perhaps fatally) hindered by the organic compounds that permeate the bones and that at the Rancho La Brea tar pits, environmental conditions might not have been ideal for the general preservation of genetic material...|$|E

40|$|In Switzerland, <b>asphalt</b> <b>deposits</b> and occurrences are {{prominent}} at the foothills {{and around the}} first synclines of the Jura Mountains in the cantons of Neuchâtel and Vaud. They are all {{closely associated with the}} Cretaceous, Hauterivian and Barremian, limestone formations. During most of the Hauterivian and Barremian, an important carbonate platform developed on the northern, passive margin of Tethys. This paper aims at providing a coherent lithostratigraphic and sedimentological framework (part I) enabling the study and elucidation of the origin of the <b>asphalt</b> <b>deposits</b> (part II). The lithostratigraphic framework study, based on a sequential analysis of the series, resulted in the revision of the classical formations defined in the region. A coherent subdivision for the region of the Jura of Neuchâtel and Northern Vaud is proposed. Two formations persist over the whole series, the "Pierre jaune de Neuchâtel", overlain by the "Calcaires urgoniens du Jura". Each formation representing a second order sequence separated by a major discontinuity, the "Discontinuité de La Russille". The sedimentological study further demonstrates the existence of three distinct carbonate depositional facies over the time period covering the two formations. Sandy oolithic and oo-bioclastic shoals, capped by the “Discontinuité De La Russille”, dominate the “Pierre jaune De Neuchâtel” paleogeography. Following the major discontinuity expressed by hard grounds, sedimentation resumed, with a calm transgressional facies constituted mainly of biostrome with large madrepores. This facies gradually morphs into a more typical urgonian facies: lagoon type deposits with rudists as well as white sandy bio-pelclastic shoal deposits. Both facies are part of the "Calcaires urgoniens du Jura" formation. The clastic facies from both formations offer good reservoir characteristic especially since they have for the most part undergone an early vadose diagenesis enhancing the primary porosity. The reservoir of the main and by far the largest asphalt deposit at La Presta (Val-de- Travers) is located in the "Calcaires urgoniens du Jura" formation. The detailed quantitative three dimensional structural and sedimentological study carried out at the asphalt mine of La Presta allows us to furthermore propose a multi-migration genetic model for the <b>asphalt</b> <b>deposits.</b> Hydrocarbon molecules expelled from the source rock by primary migration moved by secondary migration into stratigraphic and diagenetic traps formed by bio-pelclastic shoal deposits encased by pure biomicrite acting as seals, where they accumulated as oil. A tertiary migration took place during the folding of the Jura Mountains in the Tertiary, also bringing the oil-bearing reservoirs closer to surface, causing severe biodegradation of the oils into asphalts. Based on our observations at La Presta, we are now in the position to better understand the distribution of the <b>asphalt</b> <b>deposits</b> in general, controlled by the paleogeographic evolution of the Cretaceous carbonate platform and the resulting re-migration post dating the Tertiary folding of the Jura Mountains...|$|E
40|$|Fossilized fecal pellets of {{termites}} {{are found}} in pine wood preserved in the Pleistocene Carpinteria <b>asphalt</b> <b>deposits,</b> Santa Barbara County, California. Both pellets and wood are thoroughly impregnated by tar. This material is associated with characteristic plant remains found in the Carpinteria asphalt. The pellets resemble in size and shape those of the modern termites, Kalotermes minor and Zootermopsis angusticollis or Z. nevadensis. The distribution of these species today includes the Monterey peninsula. Here a living Monterey forest assemblage of plants closely resembles that which existed in and about the Carpinteria asphalt accumulation during the Pleistocene. ...|$|E
40|$|Hydrocarbon seepage is a {{widespread}} process at the continental margins of the Gulf of Mexico. We used a multidisciplinary approach, including multibeam mapping and visual seafloor observations with different underwater vehicles to study the extent and character of complex hydrocarbon seepage in the Bay of Campeche, southern Gulf of Mexico. Our observations showed that seafloor <b>asphalt</b> <b>deposits</b> previously only known from the Chapopote Knoll also occur at numerous other knolls and ridges in water depths from 1230 to 3150  m. In particular the deeper sites (Chapopopte and Mictlan knolls) were characterized by <b>asphalt</b> <b>deposits</b> accompanied by extrusion of liquid oil in form of whips or sheets, and in some places (Tsanyao Yang, Mictlan, and Chapopote knolls) by gas emission {{and the presence of}} gas hydrates in addition. Molecular and stable carbon isotopic compositions of gaseous hydrocarbons suggest their primarily thermogenic origin. Relatively fresh asphalt structures were settled by chemosynthetic communities including bacterial mats and vestimentiferan tube worms, whereas older flows appeared largely inert and devoid of corals and anemones at the deep sites. The gas hydrates at Tsanyao Yang and Mictlan Knolls were covered by a 5 -to- 10  cm-thick reaction zone composed of authigenic carbonates, detritus, and microbial mats, and were densely colonized by 1 – 2  m-long tube worms, bivalves, snails, and shrimps. This study increased knowledge on the occurrences and dimensions of asphalt fields and associated gas hydrates at the Campeche Knolls. The extent of all discovered seepage structure areas indicates that emission of complex hydrocarbons is {{a widespread}}, thus important feature of the southern Gulf of Mexico...|$|E
