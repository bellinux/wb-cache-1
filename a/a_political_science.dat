5|$|The {{project was}} plagued with {{problems}} from the outset. The first was scope. President Kennedy had begun considering {{the structure of}} his library soon after taking office, {{and he wanted to}} include archives from his administration, a museum of personal items, and <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>science</b> institute. After the assassination, the list expanded to include a fitting memorial tribute to the slain president. The variety of necessary inclusions complicated the design process and caused significant delays.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, the {{nationalist}} McGill français movement demanded that McGill become francophone, pro-nationalist, and pro-worker.

However, the majority of students and faculty opposed such a position.|$|E

25|$|Cosmos {{utilizes}} a light, conversational tone {{to render}} complex scientific topics readable for a lay audience. On many topics, the book encompasses a more concise, refined presentation of previous ideas about which Sagan had written. One critic characterized {{the book as}} containing religious rhetoric in its descriptions of science and the universe. Peter Lawler, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>science</b> professor, believes Sagan's religious rhetoric was very intentional. He believes Sagan uses images of God to describe what contact with extraterrestrial life may bring. Sagan also uses religious images as loose metaphors to help explain large, difficult concepts.|$|E

25|$|The ongoing {{involvement}} of the Canadian Forces in Afghanistan may also influence voters. Desmond Morton, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>science</b> professor at McGill University suggested that the Conservatives could be blamed for the war because they have extended the mission twice, {{despite the fact that}} it was then Liberal Leader Jean Chrétien who was Canada's prime minister when Canada's current military involvement in Afghanistan first started in 2001. Both the Conservatives and Liberals have at various times agreed to extend the mission(s) to at least 2011, so this may result in some Canadians who are strongly against Canada's ongoing involvement, who might have otherwise typically voted either Liberal or Conservative in the past, to take their votes elsewhere in 2008.|$|E
