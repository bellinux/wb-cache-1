500|$|Truman {{had been}} vice {{president}} for 82 days when President Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945. That afternoon, Truman presided over the Senate as usual. He had just adjourned the session {{for the day and}} was preparing to have a drink in House Speaker Sam Rayburn's office when he received an urgent message to go immediately to the White House. Truman assumed President Roosevelt wanted to meet with him, but Eleanor Roosevelt informed him her husband had died after suffering a massive cerebral hemorrhage. Truman's first concern was for Mrs. Roosevelt. He asked if there was anything he could do for her, to which she replied, [...] "Is there <b>anything</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do for you? For you are the one in trouble now!" ...|$|E
500|$|Seacole visited Nightingale at the Barrack Hospital in Scutari, {{where she}} asked for a bed for the night, because she {{intended}} to travel to Balaclava {{the next day to}} join her business partner. In her memoirs, she reported that her meeting with Nightingale was friendly, with Nightingale asking [...] "What do you want, Mrs. Seacole? <b>Anything</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do for you? If it lies in my power, I shall be very happy." [...] Seacole told her of her [...] "dread of the night journey by caique" [...] and the improbability of being able to find the Hollander in the dark. A bed was then found for her and breakfast sent her in the morning, with a [...] "kind message" [...] from Mrs. Bracebridge, Nightingale's helper. A footnote in the memoir states that Seacole subsequently [...] "saw much of Miss Nightingale at Balaclava," [...] but no further meetings are recorded in the text.|$|E
2500|$|The Western New York Catholic {{stated that}} [...] "This book shows how, in {{specific}} terms, {{we can all}} stretch our capacity to love beyond <b>anything</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> imagine and how prayer with meditation can tap inner strength at will.... The methods used in Love Never Faileth were familiar in the early Church, as the author illustrates through his use of inspirational passages from the four 'great lovers of God.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, {{a bronze}} calf {{sculptured}} by artist Jerry Palen was erected in Hansen's honor at the Wyoming state capital by the Wyoming Stockgrowers Association. At the dedication, Ron Micheli, {{a former state}} representative, a rancher from Fort Bridger, and an unsuccessful candidate for governor in the 2010 Republican primary against Hansen's grandson, Matt, described Hansen, accordingly, [...] "The footsteps he has left in the state surpass <b>anything</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> ever keep up with." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, after Julie-Ann {{leaves in}} search of a {{replacement}} for a missing fork, a bigger problem emerges: a woman falls into Justin's balcony. She is Paige Petite, who climbed out of the window of the penthouse she lives in, on the run from her violent gangster boyfriend, Rudi, who mistakenly believes she cheated on him. Before she can leave, Paige's [...] "minder", Micky Rale, enters, having gone {{in search of}} her. Paige refuses to go back with him, and Micky refuses to leave without her. Julie-Ann returns to discover Paige (having earlier taken a bath) wearing the dress she was intending to wear. Julie-Ann demands Paige takes off the dress, but it ends with Micky pointing a gun at Justin and insisting Julie-Ann helps herself to one of Paige's dresses upstairs. After Julie-Ann leaves, Micky acknowledges Justin is holding a party this evening and asks [...] "Is there <b>anything</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do to help?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Other gifts {{were also}} given to his neighbours. Among these was one to Chartres, of which its bishop wrote: [...] "When {{we saw the}} gift that you sent us, we were amazed at your {{knowledge}} {{as well as your}} faith… since you, whom we had heard to be a pagan prince, we now know to be not only a Christian, but also a most generous donor to God's churches and servants". He is known to have sent a psalter and sacramentary made in Peterborough (famous for its illustrations) to Cologne, and a book written in gold, among other gifts, to William the Great of Aquitaine. This golden book was apparently to support Aquitanian claims of St Martial, patron saint of Aquitaine, as an apostle. Of some consequence, its recipient was an avid artisan, scholar and devout Christian, and the Abbey of Saint-Martial was a great library and scriptorium, second only to the one at Cluny. It is likely that Cnut's gifts were well beyond <b>anything</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> now know.|$|E

2500|$|During late May 1986 (around {{three weeks}} after Lords' 18th birthday), {{authorities}} discovered she had been underage when she appeared in the porn movies. She had lied to law enforcement, photographers, producers, directors, co-workers, {{and the general public}} for two years. The owners of her movie agency and X-Citement Video, Inc. were arrested. (See United States v. X-Citement Video) She was taken into protective custody and hired [...] high-profile lawyer Leslie Abramson. On July 10, district attorney's investigators searched Lords' Redondo Beach home as well as the Sun Valley offices of Vantage International Productions (a major producer of adult movies) and the Sherman Oaks offices of modeling agent Jim South. South and other industry officials said that Lords, who was seeking employment, provided a California driver's license, a U.S. passport, and a birth certificate, which stated that her name was Kristie Nussman and gave a birth date of November 17, 1962. Leslie Jay, spokeswoman for Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, also said Lords showed identification indicating that she was older than 18 before the illicit photos for the September 1984 issue were taken (she was actually fifteen years of age in the photographs). When investigators used Lords' fake birth certificate and fake state identification cards to [...] locate the real Kristie Nussman, Nussman said that her birth certificate had been stolen a few years earlier and that an impostor had apparently forged her name on official forms. Two adults who knew Lords, but who requested anonymity, said they saw her picture in the adult magazine Velvet during July 1984, and telephoned the district attorney's office to inform authorities that she was underage, but that an investigator told them, [...] "There isn't <b>anything</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do about it." ...|$|E
