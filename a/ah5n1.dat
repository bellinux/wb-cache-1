25|$|H5N1 {{is mainly}} spread by {{domestic}} poultry, both through {{the movements of}} infected birds and poultry products and {{through the use of}} infected poultry manure as fertilizer or feed. Humans with H5N1 have typically caught it from chickens, which were in turn infected by other poultry or waterfowl. Migrating waterfowl (wild ducks, geese and swans) carry H5N1, often without becoming sick. Many species of birds and mammals can be infected with HPAI <b>A(H5N1),</b> but the role of animals other than poultry and waterfowl as disease-spreading hosts is unknown.|$|E

At least 12 companies and 17 governments are developing prepandemic influenza vaccines in 28 different clinical trials that, if successful, could turn a deadly pandemic infection into a nondeadly one. Full-scale production of a vaccine that could prevent any illness at all from the strain would require at least three months after the virus's emergence to begin, but it is hoped that vaccine production could increase until one billion doses were produced by one year after the initial identification of the virus.|$|E

50|$|Testing for {{a disease}} can be expensive, and {{distinguishing}} between two diseases can be prohibitively difficult in many countries.

50|$|The higher total case {{fatality}} ratio {{after the}} end of 2005 may reflect the widespread circulation in Vietnam of a less-lethal clade of H5N1 in 2005, which was subsequently brought under control. The change was nonetheless interpreted by some as indicating that the virus itself was becoming more deadly over time. In fact, when less-virulent strains die off, the surviving strains are the more virulent. Such difficulties in interpretation underscore that the global case fatality ratio can serve as but a crude and imperfect summary of the current complex situation with its many contributing factors, and not a clear or reliable predictive tool.
