25|$|The ELEMENT study {{dealt with}} {{determinants}} {{of academic achievement}} in Berlin. It {{was carried out in}} Berlin, where some of the pupils started at a Gymnasium after the 4th grade, while others stayed in primary school until 6th grade and started at different schools after the 6th grade. Factors correlated with academic achievement tend to be intercorrelated (that means that they are also correlated with other factors that determine academic achievement). The number of books owned by a pupil's parents, for example, is correlated with the parents' education. Because of this Multiple Regression <b>Analysis</b> <b>was</b> <b>used.</b> Multiple Regression allows us to understand the influence of one variable when the other variables are held fixed.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of Ötzi's {{intestinal}} contents showed two meals (the {{last one}} consumed about eight hours before his death), one of chamois meat, {{the other of}} red deer and herb bread. Both were eaten with grain as well as roots and fruits. The grain from both meals was a highly processed einkorn wheat bran, quite possibly eaten {{in the form of}} bread. In the proximity of the body, and thus possibly originating from the Iceman's provisions, chaff and grains of einkorn and barley, and seeds of flax and poppy were discovered, as well as kernels of sloes (small plumlike fruits of the blackthorn tree) and various seeds of berries growing in the wild.

Consisting of the National Institute of Archaeology and Heritage (INSAP) of Morocco, the German Commission for Archeology of External European Affairs (KAAK), and the University of Cologne. Archaeologists dug about 2.5 meters deep into the soil inside of the rock shelter.
