40|$|The {{ability to}} utilize heme {{compounds}} as iron sources {{was investigated in}} Vibrio anguillarum strains belonging to serotypes O 1 to O 10. All strains, regardless of their serotype or isolation origin could utilize hemin and hemoglobin as sole iron sources. Similarly, all of the isolates could bind hemin and Congo red, and this binding was mediated by cell envelope proteins. PCR and Southern hybridization were used to assay the occurrence of heme transport genes huvABCD, which have been previously described in serotype O 1. Of 23 strains studied, two serotype O 3 isolates proved negative for all huvABCD genes, whereas nine strains included in serotypes O 2, O 3, O 4, O 6, O 7, and O 10 tested negative for the outer membrane heme receptor gene huvA. A gene coding for a novel outer membrane heme receptor was cloned and characterized in a V. anguillarum serotype O 3 strain lacking huvA. The new heme receptor, named HuvS, showed significant similarity to other outer membrane heme receptors described in Vibrionaceae, but little homology (39 %) to HuvA. This heme receptor was present in 9 out of 11 of the V. anguillarum strains that tested negative for HuvA. Furthermore, complementation experiments demonstrated that HuvS could substitute for the HuvA function in Escherichia coli and V. anguillarum mutants. The huvS <b>and</b> <b>huvA</b> sequences alignment, {{as well as the}} analysis of their respective upstream and downstream DNA sequences, suggest that horizontal transfer and recombination might be responsible for generating this genetic diversity...|$|E

This study took a constructive research approach: It starts from the application domain including the initial plan and business model, then moves to the system architecture covering the architecturally significant requirements and the system structure compliant with J 2 EE architecture, finally ends at the application design elaborated by applying the J 2 EE patterns at a high level.

40|$|Vibrio anguillarum can utilize hemin and {{hemoglobin}} as sole iron sources. In {{previous work}} we identified HuvA, the V. anguillarum outer membrane heme receptor by complementation of a heme utilization mutant with a cosmid clone (pML 1) isolated from a genomic library of V. anguillarum. In the present study, we describe a gene cluster contained in cosmid pML 1, coding for nine potential heme uptake <b>and</b> utilization proteins: <b>HuvA,</b> the heme receptor; HuvZ and HuvX; TonB, ExbB, and ExbD; HuvB, the putative periplasmic binding protein; HuvC, the putative inner membrane permease; and HuvD, the putative ABC transporter ATPase. A V. anguillarum strain with an in-frame chromosomal deletion of the nine-gene cluster was impaired for growth with heme or hemoglobin {{as the sole}} iron source. Single-gene in-frame deletions were constructed, demonstrating {{that each of the}} huvAZBCD genes are essential for utilization of heme as an iron source in V. anguillarum, whereas huvX is not. When expressed in Escherichia coli hemA (strain EB 53), a plasmid carrying the gene for the heme receptor, HuvA, was sufficient to allow the use of heme as the porphyrin source. For utilization of heme as an iron source in E. coli ent (strain 101 ESD), the tonB exbBD and huvBCD genes were required in addition to huvA. The V. anguillarum heme uptake cluster shows some differences in gene arrangement when compared to homologous clusters described for other Vibrio species...|$|R
