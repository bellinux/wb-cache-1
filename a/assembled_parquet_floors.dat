40|$|The paper submits {{constructive}} {{options and}} methods {{to design and}} manufacture modular <b>parquet</b> <b>flooring,</b> as well as fastening methods in constructions. Likewise, it presents the branches of civil engineering where modular <b>parquet</b> <b>flooring</b> may be turned to profit – industrial buildings, company premises or residential premises. The turn towards the achievement of private constructions, such as individual houses, led to losing control of the modular system applied in defining the inner sizes of the constructions and implicitly to the apparition of dimensional incompatibilities between the <b>parquet</b> <b>flooring</b> and the built spaces. The paper sets out (to solve by an individualized design procedure) to achieve modular <b>parquet</b> <b>flooring</b> in industrial system, in correspondence with the sizes of the inner spaces afferent to the constructions...|$|R

25|$|TD Garden {{is one of}} two NBA arenas (along with Amway Center, home of the Orlando Magic) with <b>parquet</b> <b>floors.</b> The Celtics {{are best}} known for the {{tradition}} of the <b>parquet</b> <b>floor</b> from their Boston Garden years, originally built after World War II because of cost and the scarcity of lumber in that time. However, a traditional floor was used in the 2006 NCAA Women's Final Four and the 2009 NCAA Men's East Regional (NCAA rules require a special NCAA-specification floor be used for all tournament games). When the 2012 NCAA Men's East Regional was held at TD Garden, a lighter-shaded <b>parquet</b> <b>floor</b> was used, with the same NCAA-specific design.|$|R

40|$|Sealing {{of wooden}} <b>parqueted</b> <b>floors</b> with {{coatings}} has frequently led to complains because of odor annoyances. To estimate the VOC emissions {{of such a}} system and its time dependence, measurements were made in order to quantify the main solvent components in the air of two rooms with freshly renovated <b>parqueted</b> <b>floors</b> {{over a period of}} several months. In another investigation the formaldehyde emission of an acid-hardened parquet sealing was measured over a period of 37 days after application in a 1 cubicmetre chamber. The findings show that under unfavourable conditions the finishing of <b>parqueted</b> <b>floors,</b> which is usually done without ventilation (closed windows), may result in elevated VOC values for a longer period of time...|$|R
50|$|While the <b>parquet</b> <b>floor</b> was an {{important}} part of the history of the Celtics;, it was not originally part of the Garden. The <b>parquet</b> <b>floor</b> was built and installed in the aforementioned Boston Arena (first home of the Bruins hockey team) and moved to the Garden in 1952. It is said the Celtics knew which way the basketball would bounce off any section of the floor; this was one contributing factor to the Celtics' many NBA championships. The floor became as much a part of Boston sports lore as the Green Monster of Fenway Park. The <b>parquet</b> <b>floor</b> was used at the FleetCenter until December 22, 1999. Portions of the original floor are integrated with new parquet.|$|R

50|$|The playing {{surface in}} Western Hall has {{undergone}} several {{changes in its}} history. Originally a wooden floor, the regulation-size court was replaced with a tartan floor in 1973 and, prior to the 1993-94 basketball season, upgraded with a <b>parquet</b> <b>floor</b> {{similar to that in}} the old Boston Garden. In 2014, the <b>parquet</b> <b>floor</b> was replaced with a maple wood floor. The court is surrounded by a Chem-turf jogging track.|$|R

The wax business became more lucrative than the <b>parquet</b> <b>floor</b> business as the company developed wax for use on surfaces as diverse as dance floors and airplanes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{two main}} uses of parquetry are as wood veneer {{patterns}} on furniture and block patterns for <b>flooring.</b> <b>Parquet</b> patterns are entirely geometrical and angular—squares, triangles, lozenges.

5000|$|Similar square-paneled <b>parquet</b> <b>floors</b> {{were made}} for the Orlando Magic, Minnesota Timberwolves, Denver Nuggets, and New Jersey Nets. Of the four, only the Magic {{continue}} to use a square-paneled <b>parquet</b> <b>floor</b> (starting in 1989 at the Orlando Arena, and moved to Amway Center in 2010), which unlike the Celtics, use maple instead of oak lumber. [...] The Nets debuted their parquet at the Meadowlands Arena in 1988, and continued to use the floor until 1997. The said floor remained in use with the Seton Hall basketball team until 2007.|$|R

50|$|Wood {{flooring}} {{can also}} be installed utilizing the glue-down method. This is an especially popular method for solid <b>parquet</b> <b>flooring</b> installations on concrete sub-floors. Additionally, engineered wood flooring may use the glue-down method as well. A layer of mastic is placed onto the sub-floor using a trowel {{similar to those used}} in laying ceramic tile. The wood pieces are then laid on top of the glue and hammered into place using a rubber mallet and a protected 2x4 to create a level <b>floor.</b> Often the <b>parquet</b> <b>floor</b> will require sanding and re-finishing after the glue-down installation method due to the small size pieces.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} famous <b>parquet</b> <b>floors</b> is the one used by the Boston Celtics of the NBA. The {{original}} floor, which was installed at the Celtics' original home of Boston Arena in 1946, was moved intact to Boston Garden in 1952 and used there until the team moved to what was then known as FleetCenter in 1995, now known as TD Garden. The floor remained intact and in use until it was cut up and sold as souvenirs in 1999, after the 1998 demolition of Boston Garden. The Celtics today play on a <b>parquet</b> <b>floor</b> inside TD Garden that combines old and new sections.|$|R
