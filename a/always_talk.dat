500|$|Thierry Henry {{paid tribute}} to Larsson's {{contribution}} to Barcelona's win after the game, saying, [...] "People <b>always</b> <b>talk</b> about Ronaldinho, Eto'o, Giuly and everything, but I didn't see them today, I saw Henrik Larsson. He came on, he changed the game, that is what killed the game. Sometimes you talk about Ronaldinho and Eto'o and people like that; {{you need to talk}} about the proper footballer who made the difference, and that was Henrik Larsson tonight." [...] Henry also remarked, [...] "You have to remember that Barcelona is a team. It's not Eto'o, it's not Ronaldinho. On Wednesday, the man who made the difference was Henrik Larsson. You have to give him credit for that because when he came on he made some amazing runs around the box and he showed he is a team player. You saw two times he fed the ball back to people and that's what I <b>always</b> <b>talk</b> about, he is a team player. He did that against us, even though the first goal was a close offside decision." [...] Larsson's addition giving Barcelona the cutting edge required to overcome Arsenal was noted by international press.|$|E

500|$|The only {{long-term}} success that Shankly {{had in the}} transfer market in the late 1960s was his signing of Emlyn Hughes, {{who went on to}} captain Liverpool to victory in the European Cup. Otherwise, he did not significantly change the team until the 1969–70 season when Liverpool finished fifth in the league championship, a long way behind the winners: their local rivals Everton. Shankly was characteristically defiant whenever Everton got the better of Liverpool and, although he liked and respected everyone connected with Everton, would <b>always</b> <b>talk</b> up Liverpool at Everton's expense. Typical of this was his view that: [...] "This city has two great football teams – Liverpool and Liverpool reserves".|$|E
500|$|The Doors {{wanted to}} {{capitalize}} on the experimental climate in popular music at the time that brought about groundbreaking works like The White Album and Electric Ladyland while redefining what could be accomplished within the rock medium. Looking for a new, creative sound, Rothchild hired Paul Harris to arrange string and orchestral arrangements for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and local jazz horn players. Session musicians Doug Lubahn and Harvey Brooks also served as additional bass guitarists. The music on The Soft Parade incorporated art rock, blues rock, jazz fusion, and psychedelic rock styles. Drummer John Densmore and Manzarek, who both had jazz backgrounds, asserted they were receptive to Rothchild's jazz concept: [...] "We'd [...] <b>always</b> <b>talk</b> about using some jazz musicians – let's put some horns and strings on, man, let's see {{what it would be like}} to record with a string section and a big horn section", recalled Manzarek.|$|E

500|$|The episode has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote, [...] "One of those shows that people <b>always</b> <b>talk</b> about when discussing The Simpsons– and rightfully so. Homer's transformation from angry parent to sensible, calm husband is excellent, as is his reaction to Bart posting his angry letter. Their attempts to retrieve the letter and Burns' eventual reaction are fabulous." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: 'In many ways, [...] "Feud" [...] seemed more derivative than usual. Not only did it resemble parts of [...] "Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish", but Homer’s attempts to regain the letter before Burns reads it appear reminiscent of an episode of The Flintstones. Despite those similarities, [...] "Feud" [...] still provided a very entertaining show. The program packed in a slew of hilarious moments, from Homer’s description of a Bible story to {{his visit to the}} post office.' A reviewer for DVDTown gave the episode a grade of C, describing it as [...] "a fun episode, but far from great." [...] Ben Rayner of The Toronto Star included [...] "Blood Feud" [...] in his list of the top ten episodes of The Simpsons, noting that [...] "Homer's efforts to thwart the mail service still kill me 15 years later." ...|$|E
500|$|Chrono Trigger was scored {{primarily}} by Yasunori Mitsuda, with contributions from veteran Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, and one track composed by Noriko Matsueda. A sound programmer at the time, Mitsuda {{was unhappy with}} his pay and threatened to leave Square {{if he could not}} compose music. Hironobu Sakaguchi suggested he score Chrono Trigger, remarking, [...] "maybe your salary will go up." [...] Mitsuda composed new music and drew on a personal collection of pieces composed over the previous two years. He reflected, [...] "I wanted to create music that wouldn't fit into any established genre... music of an imaginary world. The game's director, Masato Kato, was my close friend, and so I'd <b>always</b> <b>talk</b> with him about the setting and the scene before going into writing." [...] Mitsuda slept in his studio several nights, and attributed certain pieces—such as the game's ending theme, To Far Away Times—to inspiring dreams. He later attributed this song to an idea he was developing before Chrono Trigger, reflecting that the tune was made in dedication to [...] "a certain person with whom [...] wanted to share a generation". He also tried to use leitmotifs of the Chrono Trigger main theme {{to create a sense of}} consistency in the soundtrack. Mitsuda wrote each tune to be around two minutes long before repeating, unusual for Square's games at the time. Mitsuda suffered a hard drive crash that lost around forty in-progress tracks. After Mitsuda contracted stomach ulcers, Uematsu joined the project to compose ten pieces and finish the score. Mitsuda returned to watch the ending with the staff before the game's release, crying upon seeing the finished scene.|$|E

500|$|Baba himself {{maintained}} an ambiguous profile, unwilling {{to identify with}} {{either of the two}} religions. His Muslim devotees were fully convinced that he belonged to their fold, identifying him as an avaliā. The Hindu bhaktas also viewed him as one of them, since he often identified himself with their gods and customs. Sai Baba wanted to belong to all and be shared by all. When pressed on whether he was Hindu or Muslim, he would often get very angry. Once he told a devotee: [...] "You have been with me for eighteen years now. Does Sai mean for you only these three and a half cubits of height?" [...] Sai Baba was able to avoid clashes between the two communities, and, in fact, succeeded in unifying them in an atmosphere of general harmony. In a verse of the midday arti, devotees sing: Baba would often talk about the Hindu gods, quoting from sacred texts or even commenting upon passages of the Bhagavadgita, the Isha Upanishad, and so forth. The names of Krishna and Rama seem to have been particularly dear to him. With his Muslim followers, Baba would <b>always</b> <b>talk</b> of Allah and the Koran, often quoting Persian verses. One of his favorite expressions was [...] "Allah rakhega vaiia rahena", that is, [...] "Let us be content with what we have, and submit our will to Allah." [...] On several occasions, Sai reassured his listeners by saying that he, like them, was but a devotee of Allah, a humble faqir with two arms and two legs. In later years, Parsis and even a few Christians would come to Shirdi. Sai Baba respected all creeds, true to his conviction that all religions are but particular paths leading to one ineffable goal.|$|E
500|$|Since 2004, the SpongeBob crew has {{periodically}} {{collaborated with}} the LA-based animation studio Screen Novelties to create stop-motion sequences for special episodes. The studio produced a brief claymation scene for {{the climax of the}} first theatrical film and was re-enlisted in 2009 to create an exclusive opening for the series' tenth anniversary special. The abominable snow mollusk, an octopus-like creature made of clay who acts as the antagonist of the double-length episode [...] "Frozen Face-Off," [...] was also animated by the company. Animation World Network reported that [...] "within the SpongeBob creative team, there was <b>always</b> <b>talk</b> of doing a more involved project together" [...] with Screen Novelties. As a result, the group was asked to create an episode animated entirely in stop motion in 2011. This project became [...] "It's a SpongeBob Christmas!”, which reimagined the show's characters as if {{they were part of a}} Rankin/Bass holiday film. Tom Kenny, who is not normally involved in the writing process, contributed to the episode's plot; he said in 2012 that he and Nickelodeon [...] "wanted to do something just like those old school, stop-motion Rankin-Bass holiday specials...which I watched over and over again when I was a kid growing up in Syracuse." [...] Unconventional materials such as baking soda, glitter, wood chips and breakfast cereal were used in mass quantities to create the special's sets. Members of the Screen Novelties crew received one win and two nominations at the 30th Annie Awards, a nomination at the 2013 Golden Reel Awards, and a nomination at the 2013 Annecy International Animated Film Festival for animating the episode.
