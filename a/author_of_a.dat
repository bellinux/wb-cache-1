5|$|Fleming {{was better}} known as the <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> series of books about his super-spy creation, James Bond; The Diamond Smugglers is one of two non-fiction books he wrote. It was broadly well-received, {{although}} some reviewers commented on the stories not being new.|$|E
5|$|Greek epigrams {{contribute}} {{their share}} in Pliny's descriptions of pictures and statues. One {{of the minor}} authorities for books XXXIV–XXXV is Heliodorus of Athens, the <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> work on the monuments of Athens. In the indices to XXXIII–XXXVI, an important place is assigned to Pasiteles of Naples, the <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> work in five volumes on famous works of art (XXXVI:40), probably incorporating {{the substance of the}} earlier Greek treatises; but Pliny's indebtedness to Pasiteles is denied by Kalkmann, who holds that Pliny used the chronological work of Apollodorus of Athens, as well as a current catalogue of artists. Pliny's knowledge of the Greek authorities was probably mainly due to Varro, whom he often quotes (e.g. XXXIV:56, XXXV:173, 156, XXXVI:17, 39, 41).|$|E

5|$|Moral {{rights in}} United Kingdom law {{are parts of}} {{copyright}} law that protect the personal interests of the <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> copyrighted work, {{as well as the}} economic interests protected by other elements of copyright. Found in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, the moral rights are the right to be identified as the <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> work, known as the right of paternity, the right to object to derogatory treatment of a work, known as the right of integrity, the right not to be identified as the author of someone else's work, and the right to privacy. The right of paternity exists for the entire copyright term, and requires individuals who commercially broadcast, sell, perform or exhibit literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works to identify the author of the work – but this does not apply to things such as typefaces, encyclopaedias or works subject to crown copyright.|$|E
5|$|Pollin {{dismisses the}} first of these, as have most later biographers, arguing that Imlay had access to her mother's {{writings}} and Godwin's Memoirs of the <b>Author</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> Vindication of the Rights of Woman which openly discuss the circumstances of her birth. Imlay herself even makes this distinction in letters to her half-sister Mary Godwin.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{evidence}} of Foliot's education, but he likely received an education to fit him for his career in the church. Bibliographers have frequently confused him with his predecessor as bishop, Robert of Melun, so he has mistakenly been given as the <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of documents.|$|E
5|$|According to Richard Maxwell Eaton, <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> Social History of the Deccan, Vithoba {{was first}} worshipped as a {{pastoral}} god {{as early as}} the 6th century. Vithoba's arms-akimbo iconography is similar to Bir Kuar, the cattle-god of the Ahirs of Bihar, who is now also associated with Krishna. Vithoba was probably later assimilated into the Shaiva pantheon and identified with the god Shiva, like most other pastoral gods. This is backed by the facts that the temple at Pandharpur is surrounded by Shaiva temples (most notably of the devotee Pundalik himself), and that Vithoba is crowned with the Linga, symbol of Shiva. However, since the 13th century, the poet-saints like Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram identified Vithoba with Vishnu.|$|E
5|$|Croatian {{authorities}} {{suspect that}} a further 61 individuals killed at Ovčara were buried there as well. They suspect {{one or more}} additional mass graves exist in the general area, or that the bodies originally buried at the site were moved to a secondary grave. Nevenka Nekić, the Croatian <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> book on Nicolier, claims that an additional shallow grave was excavated at Ovčara in November 1991 and that Nicolier and 60 others were buried there. According to her, they were exhumed by Croatian Serb authorities {{and moved to a}} secondary location in early 1992 because the grave was so shallow that body parts protruded through the ground surface.|$|E

Ecgbert was a correspondent of Bede and Boniface and the <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> legal code for his clergy.

5|$|Keyes, Olavo de Carvalho, <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dozen {{books on}} {{philosophical}} and political matters, and Alejandro Peña Esclusa, president of UnoAmerica, met on 3 March 2009 in Washington D.C. for an informal and friendly talk.

5|$|Makriyannis, {{having been}} ignored by history, and hardly {{mentioned}} by chroniclers of the War of Independence, had {{renewed interest in}} the revolution by offering a significant personal testimony to historical research. Despite this, after the initial interest in the newly published Memoirs, they were hardly cited for almost 40 years. One could say that Makriyannis was forgotten, {{not only as a}} fighter, but also as the <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> text written in Demotic Greek; a text that, besides reproducing the heroic atmosphere of the War of Independence, is also a treasure-house of linguistic knowledge concerning the common Greek tongue of the time.|$|E

5|$|Nothhelm (sometimes Nothelm; died 739) was {{a medieval}} Anglo-Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury. A {{correspondent}} of both Bede and Boniface, it was Nothhelm who gathered materials from Canterbury for Bede's historical works. After his {{appointment to the}} archbishopric in 735, he attended to ecclesiastical matters, including holding church councils. Although later antiquaries felt that Nothhelm was the <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of works, later research has shown them to be authored by others. After his death he was considered a saint.|$|E
5|$|Several further would-be suitors {{visited the}} Skinkers, but all were repulsed by Tannakin's face and she {{remained}} unmarried.

(The anonymous <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> Certaine Relation says that the family {{did not wish to}} divulge their address, to discourage curiosity-seekers from gathering.)
