500|$|Between 1901 and 1903, Leno {{recorded}} {{more than}} twenty-five songs and monologues on the Gramophone and Typewriter Company label. He also made 14 short films {{towards the end of}} his life, in which he portrayed a bumbling buffoon who struggles to carry out everyday tasks, such as riding a bicycle or opening a bottle of champagne. On 26 November 1901, Leno, along with Seymour Hicks and his wife, the actress Ellaline Terriss, was invited to Sandringham House {{to take part in a}} Royal Command Performance to entertain King Edward VII, Queen Alexandra, their son George and his wife, Mary, the Prince and Princess of Wales. [...] Leno performed a thirty-five-minute solo act that included two of his best-known songs: [...] "How to Buy a House" [...] and [...] "The Huntsman". After the performance, Leno reported, [...] "The King, the Queen and the Prince of Wales all very kindly shook hands with me and told me how much they had enjoyed it. The Princess of Wales was just going to shake hands with me, when she looked <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> and couldn't do it for some time, because she laughed so much. I wasn't intending to look funnyâ€“ I was really trying to look dignified and courtly; but I suppose I couldn't help myself." [...] As a memento, the king presented Leno with a jewel-encrusted royal tie pin, and thereafter, Leno became known as [...] "the King's Jester". Leno was the first music hall performer to give a Royal Command Performance during the king's reign.|$|E

[...] or [...] "Look <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> is my face bovvered? Face? Bovvered?" [...] In 2006, this catchphrase was named Word of the Year and entered the Oxford English Dictionary. A spokesperson for the OED commented ...|$|E

60|$|Benjamin {{looked a}} little sadly <b>at</b> <b>my</b> flushed <b>face</b> as we drove to Major Fitz-David's house.|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>my</b> excited <b>face</b> {{with those}} red-brown eyes of his. Silently I defied {{him to speak}} his mind.|$|R
60|$|She shot a timid glance <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> {{and looked}} troubled at the question, but made no reply.|$|E
6000|$|... "He'll {{never come}} to himself again," [...] the other brother remarked. [...] "Sarve him right. Look <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>face!</b> Let's see, mother; who's in the house?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I tell you, I do; {{and again}} I tell you, I do," [...] he replied. He paused, {{suddenly}} glancing <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> and added, [...] "Why do you ask, Davy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{frightened to}} look <b>at</b> <b>my</b> husband's <b>face</b> for fear I'll see {{in it that}} he wants to go too," [...] said a little over-harbour bride.|$|R
60|$|Alas for the perversity of maiden natures! It {{was not my}} dear {{nurse who}} brought my broth that morning, but Mrs. Manners herself. She smiled <b>at</b> <b>my</b> fallen <b>face,</b> and took a chair <b>at</b> <b>my</b> bedside.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so, not so," [...] said Katy, shoving {{her chair}} nearer {{to the place}} where the peddler sat. [...] "Not so, Harvey, you must know me <b>at</b> least; <b>my</b> <b>face</b> cannot be strange to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, yes, if you like,' {{said her}} husband patiently, '"a lucid interval." [...] Don't please look <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> like that, Sheila. Think--think that it's just lupus, just some horrible disfigurement.' ...|$|E
60|$|Having {{delivered}} this formal mandate, {{to neglect}} which meant imprisonment, or worse, {{she threw her}} cloak about her, and with a wondering glance <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> {{opened the door and}} went.|$|E
6000|$|Maisie {{shook her}} head mournfully. 'I knew you wouldn't understand, and it will only hurt you more when you find out. Look <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> Dick, {{and tell me what}} you see.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{the job was}} done, and I went to {{the lower}} door for my well-earned pay, the maid said, with condescension, as she glanced coquettishly <b>at</b> <b>my</b> ruddy <b>face</b> and eyes that twinkled under the old cap, I suspect,-- ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked again}} <b>at</b> <b>my</b> laxer, coarser <b>face,</b> {{and did not}} say {{whatever}} thought had passed across his mind.|$|R
60|$|But at length, dismissing {{all such}} folly, <b>at</b> least from <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> I lifted the trap-door and descended the steep ladder {{into the room}} beneath.|$|R
60|$|She murmured {{in reply}} {{something}} melodious and inarticulate, then glanced <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> in a questioning way; {{but only for}} a moment, then her sweet eyes were again veiled under those drooping lashes.|$|E
60|$|We {{went across}} the evening fields in silence, towards a sky of {{deepening}} gold and purple, and Effie was close beside me always, very close, glancing up ever and again <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
60|$|The old man {{frowned and}} shook his head; while she, after one swift, shy glance <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> and with {{something}} like a smile flitting over her delicate lips, turned and re-entered the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had forgotten," [...] said Grisell. [...] "I {{saw myself}} once <b>at</b> Amesbury! but <b>my</b> <b>face</b> {{was not well}} then. Let me see again, sister! Where's a mirror?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks {{for your}} offer," [...] Cuthbert replied; [...] "but <b>at</b> present <b>my</b> <b>face</b> is turned toward England. King Richard needs all his friends; {{and there is}} so little chance of sack or spoil, even should we have--which God forfend--civil war, that I fear I could ill reward the {{services}} which you offer me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her terror still upon her, {{she glanced}} upwards {{to see what}} fresh enemy was this, and then, <b>at</b> sight of <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> as <b>my</b> arms closed about her, and held her safe-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You hold me then as {{a perfect}} stranger?" [...] said the man. [...] "Look <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> more attentively, {{and see if the}} {{features}} do not resemble those of a man much known to you formerly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The alcalde {{leads me}} up to Anabela and {{presents}} me. When she took the first look <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> she dropped her fan and nearly turned her chair over from the shock. But I'm used to that.|$|E
60|$|Her lips moved, {{but made}} no sound. She seemed strangely disquieted, and shook back her loose hair, {{and with her}} small toes moved the {{sparkling}} sand at her feet, and once or twice her eyes glanced shyly <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much. I shall devote the best {{portion of this}} {{afternoon}} to {{trying to get rid}} of as much of this stain as I can, <b>at</b> least off <b>my</b> <b>face</b> and hands. The rest does not matter, one way or the other, and will wear off gradually; but I should like to get <b>my</b> <b>face</b> decent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Frances, {{how much}} regard have you for me?" [...] was my demand. No answer; the {{situation}} was yet too new and surprising to permit speech. On this consideration, I compelled myself for some seconds to tolerate her silence, though impatient of it: presently, I repeated the same question--probably, not in the calmest of tones; she looked <b>at</b> me; <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> doubtless, was no model of composure, my eyes no still wells of tranquillity.|$|R
6000|$|... "No? I {{thought you}} took it quite in that light, this morning. Well, you see we have all got poultices on; and the orderly will make one for you, <b>at</b> once. <b>My</b> <b>face</b> is bigger than it was this morning, {{and what it is}} going to come to, I cannot imagine. Although the doctor said, frankly, that he did not {{understand}} it; he seemed to think that there was nothing very serious about it." ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly she seized my downcast {{head and}} kissed my hair. She caught <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> between {{her hands and}} kissed my lips. I put my arms about her and we kissed together. I sprang {{to my feet and}} clasped her.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he turned}} and left me and I entered the house where I found my mother sitting, still in her festal robes, like one who waits. She looked <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> then asked what troubled me. I {{sat down on a}} stool at her feet and told her everything.|$|E
60|$|So back we went, Oro pausing a while {{behind and}} {{overtaking}} us with long, determined strides. Yva led us, gliding {{at my side}} and, as I thought, now and again glanced <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> with a look that was half anxious and half pitiful. Also twice she stooped and patted Tommy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wish I didn't look so like a scare-crow; {{but perhaps}} my rags {{will add to}} the effect. Won't the girls laugh <b>at</b> <b>my</b> swelled <b>face,</b> and scream at the cat. Poor mammy will mourn over me and coddle me up as if I'd been to the wars. Hope some house isn't very far off, for I don't believe I can lug this brute much farther, I'm so starved and shaky." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I board here," [...] Hilda answered, amused <b>at</b> <b>my</b> crestfallen <b>face.</b> [...] "But, of course, I {{cannot be}} idle; so I have found work to do. I ride {{out on my}} bicycle {{to two or three}} {{isolated}} houses about, and give lessons to children in this desolate place, who would otherwise grow up ignorant. It fills my time, and supplies me with something besides myself to think about." ...|$|R
60|$|After partaking of my {{evening meal}} of cheese-like food and {{vegetable}} milk I sought out Sola, whom I found working {{by the light}} of a torch upon some of Tars Tarkas' trappings. She looked up <b>at</b> <b>my</b> approach, her <b>face</b> lighting with pleasure and with welcome.|$|R
