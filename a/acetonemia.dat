5000|$|In dairy cattle, ketosis is {{a common}} ailment that usually occurs during the first weeks after giving birth to a calf. Ketosis is in these cases {{sometimes}} referred to as <b>acetonemia.</b> A study from 2011 revealed that whether ketosis is developed or not depends on the lipids a cow uses to create butterfat. Animals prone to ketosis mobilize fatty acids from adipose tissue, while robust animals create fatty acids from blood phosphatidylcholine (lecithin). Healthy animals can be recognized by high levels of milk glycerophosphocholine and low levels of milk phosphocholine. [...] Point of care diagnostic tests are available and are reasonably useful.|$|E
40|$|Pregnancy {{disease is}} a highly fatal, acute {{metabolic}} disease affecting pregnant ewes {{during the last few}} weeks of gestation. It is characterized by <b>acetonemia</b> with fatty infiltration of the liver and is often associated with a low blood sugar. The condition is found wherever sheep are raised; it has been variously called stercoremia, lambing paralysis, prenancy toxemia, and lamzietke, ketosis, domzietke, acidosis, preparturient paresis, and hypoglycemic encephalophaty, snow blindness, and twin lamb disease. The entity has been widely studied if not always well studied...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} {{reported}} case of severe isopropanolemia in a patient who did not experience associated clinical manifestationsand <b>acetonemia.</b> The patient was found lyingface down in a hotel lobby but at admission was alert and oriented to place and person. Toxicological analysis of the patient’s serum revealed the presence of isopro-panol at a concentration of 72 mmol/L. An increased serum osmolal gap (81 mOsm/kg) was also observed. The serum concentration of isopropanol decreased to 9. 5 mmol/L 15. 5 h after admission with an estimated half-life of elimination of 5 - 7 h. No serum acetone was detected throughout the patient’s hospitalization. The identity of isopropanol was confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The patient remained awake and alert while {{in the hospital and}} was discharged 5 days after admis...|$|E
40|$|Acetone is {{considered}} to be a substance that can disturb cellular oxidative status, being also associated with the production of glucose during its metabolization. The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of chronic treatment with acetone in oxidative stress and metabolic parameters in rats. Twenty male Wistar rats were divided into two groups: control (CG) and chronic acetone group (CAG). After 28 days of acetone ingestion in a 5 % aqueous solution (CAG) or water (CG) the animals were euthanized and urine, plasma and liver were collected for the determination of acetone, glucose, lipemia, hepatic fat, malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), and vitamin E. As expected, urinary and plasma acetone levels were higher in CAG. There was no difference in hepatic MDA values between groups, whereas hepatic GSH was lower in CAG than in CG and hepatic vitamin E was higher in CAG than in CG. There was also an increase in glycemia, cholesterolemia and hepatic fat in CAG compared to CG. Chronic treatment with a 5 % acetone solution produced an increase in <b>acetonemia</b> that was able to promote changes in hepatic oxidative metabolism and in lipid content in rats similar to those observed in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolism}} of acetone was {{studied in}} lean and obese humans during starvation ketosis. Acetone concentrations in plasma, urine, and breath; {{and rates of}} endogenous production, elimination in breath and urine, and in vivo metabolism were determined. There was a direct relationship between plasma acetone turnover (20 - 77 μmol/m 2 per min) and concentration (0. 19 - 1. 68 mM). Breath and urinary excretion of acetone accounted for a 2 - 30 % of the endogenous production rate, and in vivo metabolism accounted for the remainder. Plasma acetone oxidation accounted for ≅ 60 % of the production rate in 3 -d fasted subjects and about 25 % of the production rate in 21 -d fasted subjects. About 1 - 2 % of the total CO 2 production was derived from plasma acetone oxidation and {{was not related to}} the plasma concentration or production rate. Radioactivity from [14 C]acetone was not detected in plasma free fatty acids, acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, or other anionic compounds, but was present in plasma glucose, lipids, and proteins. If glucose synthesis from acetone is possible in humans, this process could account for 11 % of the glucose production rate and 59 % of the acetone production rate in 21 -d fasted subjects. During maximum <b>acetonemia,</b> acetone production from acetoacetate could account for 37 % of the anticipated acetoacetate production, which implies that a significant fraction of the latter compound does not undergo immediate terminal oxidation...|$|E
