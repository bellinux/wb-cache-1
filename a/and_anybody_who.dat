5|$|In mid-2012, {{legal issues}} arose when {{attempts}} were made to digitally re-release the film. G. Vijaya of Vijaya Pictures had filed a lawsuit against Gemini Colour Laboratory and Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures for attempting to re-release the film without her production company's permission. The reason for the suit was that in December 1975, Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures had transferred the entire rights of the film to Movie Film Circuit, which in turn had transferred them to Vijaya Pictures on 18 May 1976. Vijaya Pictures approached the Gemini Colour Laboratory to digitise the film for re-release, however Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures asked laboratory officials not to release the film without their prior consent. Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures also disputed Vijaya's claim by running an advertisement in a Tamil newspaper on 18 May 2012, stating that it was the owner of the film's rights <b>and</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> wished to exhibit it in digital format should only do so with their permission. R. Subbiah, the judge who presided over the case, ordered the status quo to be maintained by both parties.|$|E
500|$|Station to Station {{was voted}} the 13th best album of 1976 in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, {{published}} by The Village Voice. Reviewing {{the record for}} the newspaper, Christgau expressed some reservations about the length of the songs and the detached quality of Bowie's vocals, but deemed [...] "TVC 15" [...] his [...] "favorite piece of rock and roll in a very long time" [...] and wrote, [...] "spaceyness has always been his shtick, <b>and</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> can merge Lou Reed, disco, and Dr. John... deserves to keep doing it for five minutes and 29 seconds." [...] He ranked it as the year's fourth best in his ballot for the poll.|$|E
2500|$|Anselmo {{released}} an apology, {{during which he}} said, [...] "It was ugly, it was uncalled for <b>and</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> knows me and my true nature knows that I don't believe in any of that. I'm a thousand percent apologetic to anyone who took offense to what I said, cause you should've taken offense to what I said." ...|$|E

2500|$|Betza {{described}} {{his choice of}} pieces as [...] "a very basic and logical selection of the fundamental geometrical moves, except for my idiosyncratic insistence on including the Rose in the lineup of pieces. These are largely the basic units of Chess, <b>and</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> designs a [...] game with 32 pieces is bound {{to come up with}} something reasonably similar, at least if they want it to be like Chess but a bit less tactical." [...] In fact, his original plan was to include FD along with the complementary WA (the phoenix from chu shogi), but this leaves the c- and n-pawns undefended in the initial position. His final assessment was that the game was [...] "rather chesslike".|$|E
2500|$|During the 2008 presidential election, {{when asked}} if the Zionist cause is just and has succeeded, McCain responded, [...] "I think so. I'm a student of history <b>and</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> is {{familiar}} with the history of the Jewish people and with the Zionist idea can't help but admire those who established the Jewish homeland. I think it's remarkable that Zionism has been in the middle of wars and great trials and it has held fast to the ideals of democracy and social justice and human rights. I think that the State of Israel remains under significant threat from terrorist organizations as well as the continued advocacy of the Iranians to wipe Israel off the map." ...|$|E

5000|$|Moores {{said that}} Walt Wallet was his alter ego. [...] "I use Walt to create homey {{situations}} <b>and</b> for <b>anybody</b> <b>who's</b> feeling his age to identify with," [...] Moores said {{two months before}} his death. [...] "He's the father figure. He's what keeps them together. He's the one I go to when I want to pull the strip together." ...|$|R

60|$|Tom {{was already}} trying {{to heed the}} warning. He had stopped so suddenly, however, that he had stalled his engine and now {{he had to take}} time in which to use the {{electric}} starter.

60|$|I {{was skeptical}} at the moment, but time proved the {{correctness}} {{of my old}} friend's judgment; and, having been present after the opening performance at a little supper given by Burbage at which sack ran like water, <b>and</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> wanted another malvoisie and seltzer simply had to beckon to the waiter, I was able to conscientiously praise it in the highest terms.|$|E
60|$|In {{the early}} morning one of their estimable escort sent in a message {{to say that they}} were not to start before half-past ten, as the horses {{required}} more rest, so they enjoyed some hours longer in bed than they had expected, <b>and</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> has ever made a journey in a post-cart in South Africa can understand the blessing thereof. At nine they breakfasted, and as the clock struck half-past ten Mouti brought the cart round, and with it came the two Boers.|$|E

Stand off, men!" [...] And they stood off. The wave retreated backward, leaving the two leaders in front. A couple of hundred men, a moment before apparently full of furious passion and ready to take refuge in the violence of fear, were cowed by a single human being.|$|E
5000|$|Summarizing Pialat's stance as {{a filmmaker}} in a profile for Film Comment, critic Kent Jones wrote: [...] "To say that Pialat {{marched to the}} beat of a {{different}} drummer is to put it mildly.

60|$|With these instructions, Newcombe {{had gone}} to Madam Bonnet and had found that much {{disturbed}} lady {{in a state of}} partial collapse, which had followed her passion of the morning, and who had declared that nothing in the world would please her better than to get rid of her husband's daughter and never see her again. And if the creature needed clothes or anything else which belonged to her, a maid should pack them up, <b>and</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> pleased might take them to any place, provided she heard no more about them or their owner.|$|E
60|$|I nodded agreement, and {{we spent}} most of that day in sitting down and smoking, while, as it happened, a sudden breeze blew the tent over upon us at midnight, <b>and</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> has crawled clear of the {{thrashing}} canvas in such circumstances can guess what followed. Leyland, as generally happens, wriggled headforemost into what might be termed the pocket of the net, and it cost me some trouble to extricate him. Next morning he awoke with a toothache and general shortness of temper, {{as a result of}} trying to sleep in the rain, and appeared much less certain about the benefits to be derived from such excursions.|$|E
60|$|As he drummed {{his heels}} against Zam-Zammah he turned {{now and again}} from his king-of-the-castle game with little Chota Lal and Abdullah the sweetmeat-seller's son, to make a rude remark to the native {{policeman}} on guard over rows of shoes at the Museum door. The big Punjabi grinned tolerantly: he knew Kim of old. So did the water-carrier, sluicing water on the dry road from his goat-skin bag. So did Jawahir Singh, the Museum carpenter, bent over new packing-cases. So did everybody in sight except the peasants from the country, hurrying up to the Wonder House to view the things that men made in their own province and elsewhere. The Museum was given up to Indian arts and manufactures, <b>and</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> sought wisdom could ask the Curator to explain.|$|E
5000|$|Bennett ordained an anti-slang week in April 1915 <b>and</b> {{ordered that}} <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> used slang in Pomona schools be penalized.

50|$|In {{the first}} years of the new Klan, a few {{thousand}} members enrolled but eventually it became more popular and hundreds of thousands of new members pledged allegiance, particularly in industrial cities of the Midwest.
