5000|$|Reinstatement is {{a method}} used in animal testing {{procedures}} including CPP and self-administration. It {{is often used to}} model the behavior of drug relapse in humans, although its validity is a topic of debate. [...] Reinstatement is the rapid reacquisition of an extinct behavior, which is caused by either the presentation of the unconditioned stimulus, by stress, or by context cues. This shows that the process of extinction does not completely eliminate an association, since the association between the UCS and the CS can be rapidly reacquired. In the context of conditioned place preference, after a place preference has been extinguished, the behavior is said to be reintsated when the animal quickly reacquires their place preference after repeated extinction trials have caused the preference to be extinguished. This has implications for research on drug relapse. There are two main modes of <b>action</b> <b>for</b> which <b>reinstatement</b> is often tested in the conditioned place preference paradigm. One is by introducing the animal (generally rats or mice are used) to stress. The other is by giving them a small dose of the unconditioned stimulus. In the case of CPP, when drugs are used to establish conditioned place preference, this is called drug priming.|$|R
40|$|Virginie Pontin v. T-Comalux SA, ECJ (Third Chamber), Judgment of 29 October 2009, C- 63 / 08] In autumn 2009 the ECJ {{made another}} {{step forward in}} {{fostering}} gender equality through the instrumental framework of the EU law. The case triggers the right of pregnant women to protection against employers, who use inadequately constructed procedural norms to disguise an illegal dismissal. The Court holds that where the only remedy available under national legislation to a worker dismissed during pregnancy does not provide reasonable time bars on claims for wrongful dismissal, that legislation introduces less favorable treatment linked to pregnancy and constitutes discrimination against female employees. The Court held that a 15 days limit to bring proceedings was insufficient {{in terms of the}} principle of effective judicial protection of an individual’s rights under EU law. A pregnant woman should equally enjoy other remedies beyond an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> nullity and <b>reinstatement,</b> such as an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> damages, in case the analogous recourses are available for other categories of dismissed workers. The Court therefore clarified an essential element for the implementation of the Pregnant Workers’ Directive in the Member States...|$|R
