5|$|Don Robinson {{took over}} as {{chairman}} and appointed Colin <b>Appleton</b> as the new manager. Both had previously held the equivalent roles with non-league Scarborough. Promotion to Division Three followed in 1983, with a young team featuring the likes of future England international Brian Marwood, future England manager Steve McClaren, centre-forward Billy Whitehurst, and the prolific goal-scorer Les Mutrie. When Hull City missed out on promotion by one goal the following season, <b>Appleton</b> left to manage Swansea City.|$|E

5|$|Crane's {{contract}} with <b>Appleton</b> {{allowed him to}} receive a flat ten percent royalty of all copies sold. However, the contract also stipulated {{that he was not}} to receive royalties from the books sold in Great Britain, where they were released by Heinemann in early 1896 as part of its Pioneer Series. In 1982, W. W. Norton & Company published a version of the novel based on Crane's original 1894 manuscript of 55,000 words. Edited by Henry Binder, this version is questioned by those who believe Crane made the original edits for the 1895 <b>Appleton</b> edition on his own accord. Since its initial publication, the novel has never gone out of print.|$|E

That year James <b>Appleton,</b> a Whig {{representative}} in the state legislature, proposed a prohibition law, and Dow spoke often and forcefully {{in favor of the}} effort, which was unsuccessful. <b>Appleton</b> proposed a similar law in 1838 and 1839, but despite his and Dow's best efforts, he continued to be defeated.|$|E

5|$|In July 2014, Waddock's {{contract}} was terminated after {{a change of}} ownership and he was replaced by Michael <b>Appleton.</b> Waddock's surprise sacking ensured he had the worst record of any Oxford manager, winning only once and losing seven times in his eight games {{in charge of the}} club. After an indifferent first season under <b>Appleton,</b> Oxford achieved promotion to League One in his second year in charge, finishing the 2015–16 season in 2nd place with 86 points. They also reached the final of the League Trophy at Wembley Stadium, only the club's third appearance at the national stadium, but were defeated 3–2 by their League One opponents Barnsley. In 2016–17, having sold Kemar Roofe during the close season for a record £3m and signed Marvin Johnson for an undisclosed fee also thought to be a club record, Oxford finished 8th in League One, four points short of the playoff places, and again lost in the final of the League Trophy at Wembley, this time to relegation-bound Coventry City. <b>Appleton</b> left the club to become assistant manager at Leicester City of the Premier League in June 2017, and was replaced by Pep Clotet, formerly assistant manager at Leeds United.|$|E
5|$|On November 19, 1834, Pierce married Jane Means <b>Appleton</b> (March 12, 1806– December 2, 1863), the {{daughter}} of Jesse <b>Appleton,</b> a Congregational minister {{and former president of}} Bowdoin College, and Elizabeth Means. The Appletons were prominent Whigs, in contrast with the Pierces' Democratic affiliation. Jane was shy, devoutly religious, and pro-temperance, encouraging Pierce to abstain from alcohol. She was somewhat gaunt, and constantly ill from tuberculosis and psychological ailments. She abhorred politics and especially disliked Washington, D.C., creating a tension that would continue throughout Pierce's political ascent.|$|E
5|$|Wilder {{resigned}} in January 2014 and was announced {{as the new}} manager of Northampton Town the following day.

He was replaced by Pep Clotet, former assistant manager at Leeds United, in July 2017.|$|E

5|$|As {{an amateur}} rugby union player John was not paid to play rugby at club or {{international}} level. To receive money for playing {{would have been}} recognised {{as an act of}} professionalism and would have resulted in action from one of the governing unions, normally suspension or a ban. To prevent players switching to professional rugby league, players were given 'boot money' by their clubs or sponsors, named after the early practice of placing money in the players' boots. In his 2011 book Addy, Meirion <b>Appleton</b> claimed that in the 1970s he made illegal payments to both John and Gareth Edwards. <b>Appleton</b> claims that before an international match he gave both players envelopes containing money from sportswear manufacturer Adidas. John was never charged with taking illegal payments during his career.|$|E
5|$|Both {{videos were}} shot {{as a set}} and cost £500,000 to make. The videos took four months of {{production}} before release.

5|$|It was at {{this point}} that the team had yet another stroke of luck. Bowen's former thesis advisor at King's College, London, was Edward <b>Appleton,</b> who had worked with Watt and Harold Pye during the 1920s. Pye had since gone on to form his own radio company, Pye Ltd., and was active in the {{television}} field. They had recently introduced a new television set based on an innovative vacuum tube developed by Philips of Holland, the EF50 pentode. <b>Appleton</b> mentioned the Pye design to Bowen, who found it to be a great improvement over the EMI version, and was happy to learn there had been a small production run {{that could be used for}} their experiments. The design became widely known as the Pye strip.|$|E
