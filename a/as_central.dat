5|$|American kestrels in Canada and the {{northern}} United States typically migrate south in the winter, sometimes going as far <b>as</b> <b>Central</b> America and the Caribbean. Birds that breed south of about 35° north latitude are usually year-round residents. Migration also depends on local weather conditions. Wintering kestrels' choice of habitat varies by sex. Females are found in open areas more often than males during the non-breeding season. A common explanation for this behavior is that the larger females arrive at the preferred habitat first and exclude males from their territory.|$|E

5|$|Feminist economists {{join the}} UN {{and others in}} {{acknowledging}} care work, {{as a kind of}} work which includes all tasks involving caregiving, <b>as</b> <b>central</b> to economic development and human well-being.

Feminist economists have argued that unpaid domestic work is as valuable as paid work, so measures of economic success should include unpaid work. They have shown that women are disproportionately responsible for performing such care work.|$|E

5|$|After exiting Herkimer, NY5 {{continues}} east, closely paralleling {{this time}} the canal, through the city of Little Falls as Main Street, where two more concurrencies occur, with NY167 and NY169.

NY5 then continues east on State Street to Broadway, where it again turns south east shortly before returning east on a small spur of Broadway, traveling underneath US9 and I-787. NY5 ends at the Hudson River.|$|E
