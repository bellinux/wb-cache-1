5|$|After his {{tours of}} duty in New York and France, Juskalian volunteered to fight in Vietnam in late spring of 1963. He arrived in Saigon in August 1963 and took up a posting as deputy senior advisor to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam's IV Corps {{stationed}} in the Mekong Delta. After six months, Jukalian {{was assigned to the}} headquarters of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) to serve as the MACV inspector general under General William Westmoreland, the MACV commander. As part of his duties, he traveled throughout South Vietnam on inspection visits to many military installations. In the transient officers quarters at Danang, he found <b>an</b> <b>ashtray</b> from George Mardikian's Omar Khayyam restaurant in San Francisco and kept it as a souvenir {{for the rest of his}} life. For his service in the Vietnam War, Juskalian was awarded an Air Medal and a Bronze Star.|$|E
5|$|After the album's release, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a successful world tour that was once again filled with incidents. In late summer 2002, whilst the band were on tour in the US, Noel, Bell and touring keyboardist Jay Darlington {{were involved in a}} car accident in Indianapolis. While none of the band members sustained any major injuries, some shows were cancelled as a result. In December 2002, {{the latter half of the}} German leg of the band's European tour had to be postponed after Liam Gallagher, Alan White and three other members of the band's entourage were arrested after a violent brawl at a Munich nightclub. The band had been drinking heavily and tests showed that Liam had used cocaine. Liam lost two front teeth and kicked a police officer in the ribs, while Alan suffered minor head injuries after getting hit with <b>an</b> <b>ashtray.</b> Two years later Liam was fined around £40,000. The band finished their tour in March 2003 after returning to those postponed dates.|$|E
5|$|Hindley was not arrested with Brady, but {{she demanded}} {{to go with}} him to the police station, {{accompanied}} by her dog, Puppet, to which the police agreed. Hindley was questioned about the events surrounding Evans's death, but she refused to make any statement beyond claiming that it had been an accident. As the police had no evidence that Hindley was involved in Evans's murder, she was allowed to go home, on the condition that she return the next day for further questioning. Hindley was at liberty for four days following Brady's arrest, during which time she went to her employer's premises and asked to be dismissed, so that she would be eligible for unemployment benefits. While in the office where Brady worked, she found some papers belonging to him in an envelope that she claimed she did not open, which she burned in <b>an</b> <b>ashtray.</b> She believed that they were plans for bank robberies, {{nothing to do with the}} murders. On 11 October, Hindley was charged as an accessory to the murder of Edward Evans and was remanded at Risley.|$|E

25|$|While a half-owner of the Brewers, Veeck {{served for}} nearly three years in the United States Marine Corps during World War II in an {{artillery}} unit. During this time a recoiling artillery piece crushed his leg, requiring amputation first of the foot, and shortly after of the leg above the knee. Over the course of his life he had 36 operations on the leg. He had a series of wooden legs and, as an inveterate smoker, cut holes in them to use as <b>an</b> <b>ashtray.</b>|$|E
25|$|Female smokers in film {{were also}} early on {{associated}} with a type of sensuous and seductive sexuality, most notably personified by German film star Marlene Dietrich. Similarly, actors like Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn have been closely identified with their smoker persona, {{and some of their}} most famous portraits and roles have involved them being haloed by a mist of cigarette smoke. Hepburn often enhanced the glamor with a cigarette holder, most notably in the film Breakfast at Tiffany's. Smoking could also be used as a means to subvert censorship, as two cigarettes burning unattended in <b>an</b> <b>ashtray</b> were often used to suggest sexual activity.|$|E
25|$|In 1975 the NAC board {{decided to}} play the home matches on a Saturday evening. In this period a group of fanatic NAC fans merged and located {{themselves}} on a stand. Their fierce support lead to an attraction of youngsters, who also fanatically support NAC. This fierce support lasts till now and is known in the Netherlands as an Avondje NAC (English; An Evening NAC). An Avondje NAC is a flamboyant mix of Burgundian fun, beer, fanaticism and love for the club and ensures that during home matches {{the atmosphere in the}} stadium is intimidating. On October 6, 1979, a strange situation occurred. During the home match against NAC’s rivals Feyenoord the linesman was hit by <b>an</b> <b>ashtray.</b> The referee postponed the match, riots broke out and the incident in the Netherlands is known as the ‘Ashtray Incident’.|$|E

25|$|After {{the last}} take, Miranda and Durante gave an impromptu {{performance}} on the set for the cast and technicians. The singer took several cast members and some friends home with her for a small party. She went upstairs to bed at about 3 a.m. Miranda undressed, placed her platform shoes in a corner, lit a cigarette, placed it in <b>an</b> <b>ashtray</b> and went into her bathroom to remove her makeup. She apparently came from the bathroom with a small, round mirror in her hand; in the small hall which led to her bedroom, she collapsed with a fatal heart attack. Miranda was 46 years old. Her body was found at about 10:30a.m. lying in the hallway. The Jimmy Durante Show episode in which Miranda appeared was aired two months after her death, on 15 October 1955, and a clip of the episode {{was included in the}} A Network's Biography episode about the singer.|$|E
25|$|On May 30, 1861, Lewis Powell {{left home}} and {{traveled}} to Jasper, Florida, where he enlisted in Company I of the 2nd Florida Infantry. He was accepted because {{he lied about}} his age (he claimed to be 19). Powell's unit fought in March and April 1862 in the Peninsula Campaign. Powell became a battle-hardened and effective soldier. He won praise from his commanding officers, and claimed that when he shot his rifle he did so to kill (never to wound). He was alleged to have carried the skull of a Union soldier with him, which he used as <b>an</b> <b>ashtray.</b> His one-year enlistment having expired, Powell received a two-month furlough, during which time he returned home to visit his family. He re-enlisted at Jasper on May 8, 1862. In November 1862, Powell fell ill and was hospitalized at General Hospital No. 11 in Richmond, Virginia. He returned to active duty within a few weeks, and fought in the Battle of Fredericksburg (December 11–15, 1862) near Fredericksburg, Virginia. His unit was then assigned to Third Corps, Army of Northern Virginia, which was organized {{at the beginning of}} 1863. Third Corps finally went into combat at the Battle of Gettysburg, July 1–3, 1863.|$|E
500|$|Closing Times art was {{designed}} by Cal Schenkel. Schenkel's front cover art was inspired by [...] "Waits' own idea of how the album should sound." [...] It depicts Waits leaning against a bar-room piano which is furnished with a shot of rye, a bottle of beer, cigarettes, <b>an</b> <b>ashtray</b> and a small candle with a blue pool table lamp above Waits' head. The back cover art is minimal and only features a photograph of Waits staring directly into the camera, reputedly taken after one of Waits' performance at The Troubadour. Both photographs were taken by Ed Caraeff.|$|E

500|$|The band {{finished}} recording {{their debut}} album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, at Chapel Studios in Lincolnshire in September 2005 with British record producer Jim Abbiss producing. Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not became the fastest selling debut album in UK chart history, selling 363,735 copies {{in the first}} week. This smashed the previous record of 306,631 copies held by Popstars by Hear'Say, and sold more copies on its first day alone – 118,501 – {{than the rest of}} the Top 20 albums combined. The cover sleeve of Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, showing Chris McClure, a friend of the band smoking a cigarette, was criticised by the head of the NHS in Scotland for [...] "reinforcing the idea that smoking is OK". The image on the CD itself is a shot of <b>an</b> <b>ashtray</b> full of cigarettes. The band's product manager denied the accusation, and suggested the opposite – [...] "You can see from the image smoking is not doing him the world of good." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1939, Stalin {{approved}} {{the publication of}} one volume of poetry, From Six Books; however, the collection was withdrawn and pulped {{after only a few}} months. In 1993, it was revealed that the authorities had bugged her flat and kept her under constant surveillance, keeping detailed files on her from this time, accruing some 900 pages of [...] "denunciations, reports of phone taps, quotations from writings, confessions of those close to her". Although officially stifled, Akhmatova's work continued to circulate in secret. Akhmatova's close friend, chronicler Lydia Chukovskaya described how writers working to keep poetic messages alive used various strategies. A small trusted circle would, for example, memorise each other's works and circulate them only by oral means. She tells how Akhmatova would write out her poem for a visitor on a scrap of paper to be read in a moment, then burnt in her stove. The poems were carefully disseminated in this way, however it is likely that many compiled in this manner were lost. [...] "It was like a ritual," [...] Chukovskaya wrote. [...] "Hands, matches, <b>an</b> <b>ashtray.</b> A ritual beautiful and bitter." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's cover artwork {{features}} {{a photo of}} Donald Fagen as a disc jockey, wearing a collared shirt and tie, speaking into a RCA 77DX microphone. In front of him is a turntable (16inch '50s model, with a [...] tonearm), <b>an</b> <b>ashtray,</b> and a pack of Chesterfield King cigarettes. Visible {{on the table with}} the record player, is the cover of the 1958 jazz album Sonny Rollins and the Contemporary Leaders (one of Fagen's favorite albums). On the wall behind is a large clock, indicating that the time is 4:09. An advertisement in Billboard shortly before the album's release described the album cover: [...] "At 4:09 a.m., silence and darkness have taken hold of the city. The only sound is the voice of The Nightfly". Fagen appeared on the album cover despite his reclusive nature. [...] "It was an autobiographical album so it seemed like I might as well go public with it," [...] he said. The cover was shot in Fagen's apartment in the Upper East Side of Manhattan by photographer James Hamilton. Two shoots were arranged because in the first, the RCA microphone was facing the wrong direction. Gale Sasson and Vern Yenor are credited with the cover's set design.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, in the 1950s and 1960s, {{cigarette}} brands {{were frequently}} sponsors of television programs. One {{of the most}} famous television jingles of the era came from an advertisement for Winston cigarettes. The slogan [...] "Winston tastes good like a cigarette should!" [...] proved to be catchy. Another popular slogan from the 1960s was [...] "Us Tareyton smokers would rather fight than switch!," [...] which was used to advertise Tareyton cigarettes. America's first regular television news program, Camel News Caravan, was sponsored by Camel Cigarettes and featured <b>an</b> <b>ashtray</b> on the desk in front of the newscaster and the Camel logo behind him.

2500|$|As {{with all}} Big Brother series' since Big Brother 3 in 2002, the House {{was located in}} Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, just north of London, and was {{completely}} rebuilt with a new look for the 2008 series. The first images of the House were released in late May and showed the kitchen, living area, bathroom, {{one of the two}} bedrooms, and parts of the garden. The initial set of pictures revealed a lavish, Romanesque bathroom and a red kitchen fitted with triangular furniture and wall slats facing inwards, The bedroom shown (which the housemates nicknamed [...] "B-Block") contains only eight beds surrounded by lockers and the garden was enlarged with vibrant colours and <b>an</b> <b>ashtray</b> in which housemates may smoke. The dining table had only eight seats when first shown to the public; it was later shown during the launch that there was a second adjoining table.|$|E

2500|$|James Smith was an {{unemployed}} divorcé {{living in the}} Gorton area of Manchester. Described by acquaintances as [...] "house-proud and well-groomed", he was a teetotaller and non-smoker. His marriage had ended after ten years in 1980 due to his violence towards his wife. He had then commenced an affair between 19801982 with 20-year-old Tina Watson, whom he [...] "used as a punch-bag", even subjecting her to severe beatings while {{she was pregnant with}} his child. She said: [...] "At first it was now and again; just a little tap. But {{in the end it was}} every day. He would smack me in the face or hit me over the head with <b>an</b> <b>ashtray.</b> He would kick me in the legs or between the legs." [...] Watson managed to escape from the relationship, during which Smith had also attempted to drown her while she was bathing. In 1982 Smith then began a relationship with 15-year-old Wendy Mottershead, who was also a victim of his violence. In one attack he held her head under water in the kitchen sink in an attempt to drown her.|$|E

60|$|He {{was born}} about 1860; {{and has been}} a member of Parliament since about 1890. For the first half of his life he was a Liberal; for the second half he has been a Conservative; but his actual policy in Parliament has {{remained}} largely unchanged and consistent. His policy in Parliament is as follows: he takes a seat in a room downstairs at Westminster, and takes from his breast pocket an excellent cigar-case, from which in turn he takes an excellent cigar. This he lights, and converses with other owners of such cigars on equus celer or such matters as may afford him entertainment. Two or three times in the afternoon a bell rings; whereupon he deposits the cigar in <b>an</b> <b>ashtray</b> with great particularity, taking care not to break the ash, and proceeds to an upstairs room, flanked with two passages. He then walks into whichever of the two passages shall be indicated to him by a young man of the upper classes, holding a slip of paper. Having gone into this passage he comes out of it again, is counted by the young man and proceeds downstairs again; where he takes up the cigar once more, being careful not to break the ash. This process, which is known as Representative Government, has never called for any great variety in the manner of his life. Nevertheless, while his Parliamentary policy is unchanged, his change from one side of the House to the other did correspond with a certain change in his general policy in commerce and social life. The change of the party label is by this time quite a trifling matter; but there was in his case a change of philosophy or at least a change of project; though it was not so much becoming a Tory, as becoming rather the wrong kind of Socialist. He is a man with a history. It is a sad history, for he is certainly a less good man than he was when he started. That is why he is the man who is really behind Eugenics. It is because he has degenerated that he has come to talking of Degeneration.|$|E
