5|$|Through the series, {{the cities}} used within the Crazy Taxi games have been {{influenced}} by real-world cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, <b>and</b> <b>Las</b> <b>Vegas.</b> Certain versions of the Crazy Taxi game include in-game counterparts of real-world businesses, including Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, FILA, and Tower Records; these were often destination targets for the passengers. Although {{this is one of the}} most prominent examples of product placement in video gaming history, it is generally looked upon relatively favorably amongst gamers, perhaps because it gives a sense of realism to the fictional cities in the game. These establishments have been replaced with generic businesses in later games due to licensing difficulties.|$|E

The maximum {{intensity}} observed in the urban areas that were affected was VII (Very strong), but the intensity in the epicentral area is unknown because of its remote location in the mountainous Angeles National Forest, though rock slides and landslides occurred there {{as a result of}} strong shaking. Intensity VI (Strong) effects were observed over 1,100 km2, from Altadena and La Verne along the base of the mountains, to East Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Grand Forks International Airport (GFK, KGFK) {{is served}} by Delta Air Lines with several daily round trips to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport; and Allegiant Air, which {{operates}} flights {{a few times a}} week to Mesa, Arizona (Phoenix-Gateway), Sanford, Florida (Orlando-Sanford) <b>and</b> <b>Las</b> <b>Vegas,</b> Nevada. A new passenger terminal completed in early 2011, allowed more passengers to come through the airport, improved circulation, added a baggage claim and addressed security and safety concerns. The airport was a major distribution center for FedEx, which conducts flights daily within the state and northern Minnesota. FedEx moved their flight operations to Fargo, ND on October 31, 2016. The airport is one of the busiest airports in the country, due in large measure to the presence of the John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences of the University of North Dakota.|$|E
5|$|Of all the U.S. Presidents he {{associated}} with during his career, he was closest to John F. Kennedy. Sinatra often invited Kennedy to Hollywood <b>and</b> <b>Las</b> <b>Vegas,</b> {{and the two}} would womanize and enjoy parties together. In January 1961 Sinatra and Peter Lawford organized the Inaugural Gala in Washington, D.C., held on the evening before President Kennedy was sworn into office. In 1962, Sinatra was snubbed by Kennedy {{during his visit to}} Palm Springs when he decided to stay with the Republican Bing Crosby, due to FBI concerns about Sinatra's alleged connections to organized crime. Sinatra had invested a lot of his own money in upgrading the facilities at his home in anticipation of the President's visit, fitting it with a heliport, which he later reportedly smashed up with a sledgehammer upon being rejected. Despite the snub, when he learned of Kennedy's assassination he reportedly sobbed in his bedroom for three days.|$|E

5|$|The {{backbone}} of Phoenix's freeway system {{is composed of}} three major freeways—Interstate 10, Interstate 17, and U.S. Route 60. Interstate 10, being a transcontinental route between California and Florida, is the most heavily traveled freeway in the Valley of the Sun. Interstate 17 runs {{down the center of}} Arizona, connecting Phoenix with Sedona, Prescott, Flagstaff and the Grand Canyon. U.S. Route 60 spans most of the country, but is only a controlled-access highway (i.e. freeway) for a few short stints, one of them being in the East Valley. West of Phoenix, it shuttles travelers to cities such as Wickenburg, Kingman <b>and</b> <b>Las</b> <b>Vegas</b> (by way of a connection in Wickenburg with U.S. Route 93). In addition to these three freeways, three beltways, Routes 101, 202, and 303 loop around Phoenix, the East Valley, and the West Valley, respectively. State Route 51 connects Downtown with the northern reaches of the city, and Arizona State Route 143 is a distributor for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious covers human {{trafficking}} in the United States, Western and Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia. Interviews are interspersed with re-enactments. The film {{opens with a}} re-enactment of a girl being kidnapped by organized criminals. She is confined with other girls in a dark room, lit by a flickering lightbulb. Men order the girls to remove their clothes, and then examine them and shout commands and threats at them, causing them to cry from fear. One girl is dragged into another room. A victim of ordeals such as these, speaking in voiceover, explains that, in this situation, girls are often taken into a separate room to have their sexual performance tested. Identifying these events as taking place near Belgrade, Serbia, the film then tracks the fictional girls through Croatia to Amsterdam's red-light district De Wallen, and to sex markets in Berlin <b>and</b> <b>Las</b> <b>Vegas.</b> The film states that this slavery goes unnoticed in cities where prostitution is legal. Slaves are depicted in confinement, at their places of work, and as they are sold. Many of the girls are orphans, and all are either kidnapped or tricked into forced prostitution. Traffickers in the film use hard drugs, brainwashing and sexual and physical abuse to keep the girls under control.|$|E
