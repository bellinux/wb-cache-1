5|$|Most {{microorganisms}} {{and plants}} can biosynthesize all 20 standard amino <b>acids,</b> while animals (including humans) must obtain {{some of the}} amino <b>acids</b> from the diet. The amino <b>acids</b> that an organism cannot synthesize on its own {{are referred to as}} essential amino <b>acids.</b> Key enzymes that synthesize certain amino <b>acids</b> are not present in animals — such as aspartokinase, which catalyses {{the first step in the}} synthesis of lysine, methionine, and threonine from aspartate. If amino <b>acids</b> are present in the environment, microorganisms can conserve energy by taking up the amino <b>acids</b> from their surroundings and downregulating their biosynthetic pathways.|$|E
5|$|A {{comparative}} study of the amino acid composition of eleven Portuguese wild edible mushroom species showed Boletus edulis to have the highest total amino acid content, about 2.3g per 100g of dried mushroom.

5|$|Amino <b>acids</b> are the {{structural}} units (monomers) {{that make up}} proteins. They join together to form short polymer chains called peptides or longer chains called either polypeptides or proteins. These polymers are linear and unbranched, with each amino acid within the chain attached to two neighboring amino <b>acids.</b> The process of making proteins encoded by DNA/RNA genetic material is called translation and involves the step-by-step addition of amino <b>acids</b> to a growing protein chain by a ribozyme that is called a ribosome. The order in which the amino <b>acids</b> are added is read through the genetic code from an mRNA template, which is a RNA copy {{of one of the}} organism's genes.|$|E
5|$|Amino <b>acids</b> {{are usually}} {{classified}} by {{the properties of}} their side chain into four groups. The side chain can make an amino acid a weak acid or a weak base, and a hydrophile if the side chain is polar or a hydrophobe if it is nonpolar.

5|$|Amino <b>acids</b> {{that share}} the same biosynthetic pathway tend {{to have the same}} first base in their codons. This could be an {{evolutionary}} relic of an early, simpler genetic code with fewer amino <b>acids</b> that later evolved to code a larger set of amino <b>acids.</b> It could also reflect steric and chemical properties that had another effect on the codon during its evolution. Amino <b>acids</b> with similar physical properties also tend to have similar codons, reducing the problems caused by point mutations and mistranslations.|$|E

5|$|Given the non-random genetic triplet coding scheme, a tenable {{hypothesis}} for {{the origin}} of genetic code could address multiple aspects of the codon table, such as absence of codons for D-amino <b>acids,</b> secondary codon patterns for some amino <b>acids,</b> confinement of synonymous positions to third position, the small set of only 20 amino <b>acids</b> (instead of a number approaching 64), and the relation of stop codon patterns to amino acid coding patterns.|$|E
5|$|In amino <b>acids</b> {{that have}} a carbon chain {{attached}} to the α–carbon (such as lysine, shown to the right) the carbons are labeled in order as α, β, γ, δ, and so on.

5|$|In animals, {{when there}} is an {{oversupply}} of dietary carbohydrate, the excess carbohydrate is converted to triglycerides. This involves the synthesis of fatty <b>acids</b> from acetyl-CoA and the esterification of fatty <b>acids</b> in the production of triglycerides, a process called lipogenesis. Fatty <b>acids</b> are made by fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty <b>acids</b> are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acetyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups, in animals and fungi all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate enzymes perform each step in the pathway. The fatty <b>acids</b> may be subsequently converted to triglycerides that are packaged in lipoproteins and secreted from the liver.|$|E

5|$|On the {{ketogenic}} diet, carbohydrates {{are restricted}} and so cannot provide {{for all the}} metabolic needs of the body.
