40|$|One common {{belief in}} equity {{valuation}} is all valuation models measure the same intrinsic value. This paper explains {{why this is}} not the case theoretically, and addresses an unresolved question in Liu, Nissim and Thomas (2002) : how simple earnings multiples outperform complex discount based valuation models (DBVM). Our theoretical reasoning suggests the DBVMs are designed to measure the intrinsic value of stock, while the multiples are to measure the current stock price. The paper extends the pricing error result and examines the performance of models when their estimates are compared to the intrinsic value directly. Three alternative measures of the intrinsic value are chosen: i) linear fitted value, ii) moving <b>average</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> for the next five years, and iii) return generation ability. A surprising result is, contrary to the theory and our expectation that the DBVMs would outperform the multiples in intrinsic value measurement, the multiples still outperform the DBVMs in all three measures.

Inflation {{has been defined as}} an increase in the <b>average</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> {I}. A popular indicator of the rate of inflation is the annual percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (cpr) { 2 }, The CPI is intended to apply to consumer purchases, yet the concept implies that a similar indicator of the annual percentage change in prices of inputs purchased by agricultural research organizations conceivably could be developed. This paper reports an attempt to develop a quantitative measure of changes in {{the purchasing}} power of dollars appropriated from 1973 to 1978 for agricultural research in state agricultural experiment stations (SAES). It is intended to be a complete agricultural research price index, constructed to provide an accurate index for deflating the rising dollar expenditures for agricultural research to constant purchasing power. It is hoped such an index will lead to more accurate forecasting of the rate of increase in the cost of doing research and thus help agricultural science administrators adjust for inflation in budget making and expenditure programming.

40|$|Lack of {{international}} comparability in crude steel prices presents {{a problem in}} constructing an econometric model of the global steel market. The commonly used measures of crude steel prices are the weighted average of the prices of steel products and the index of the weighted <b>average</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> based on a certain year. But {{in the context of}} constructing an econometric model of the global steel market, these measures are not comparable internationally. If the various product prices are cointegrated, it is appropriate to use the price of the most widely produced and traded product in the model (uncoated steel sheet) as an indicator of the general movement of crude steel prices. This paper concludes that the price of uncoated steel sheet cointegrates with the prices of other steel products in France and Germany. The same is not true of the United States, which may point to quality problems with the price data. Use of the price data of uncoated steel sheet as the indicator of crude steel prices in the global steel model would thus seem appropriate for capturing long-term price movements of various steel products. Using cointegration tests, this paper also investigates the relationship between macroeconomic variables and steel product prices.

As the federal government assumes greater financial responsibility for prescription drug expenditures {{with the introduction of}} Medicare part D, federal policymakers are increasingly concerned about prescription drug prices. GAO was asked to examine the change in retail prices and other pricing benchmarks for drugs frequently used by Medicare beneficiaries and other individuals with health insurance from 2000 through 2004. To examine the change in retail prices from 2000 through 2004, we obtained usual and customary (U&C) prices from two state pharmacy assistance programs for drugs frequently used by Medicare beneficiaries and non-Medicare enrollees in the 2003 Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) Federal Employee Program (FEP). The U&C price is the price an individual without prescription drug coverage would pay at a retail pharmacy.

40|$|The Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC) {{program was}} created in the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 2014 as a shallow loss program {{protecting}} against year to year declines in farm income. The 2014 farm bill redirected commodity programs from fixed direct income transfers to countercyclical payments that are released when certain financial stress indicators are reached. This study looks at four adaptations to the ARC program and their consequences at the county level and to the U. S. government. The four adaptations considered were: changing formulas that currently restrict the use of very low yields in computing revenue guarantees; adjusting the geographic region from county to the crop reporting district or state; tying payments to planted acres instead of historical base acres; and using a simple <b>average</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> and yields rather than Olympic averages to compute the ARC benchmark revenue for each county. The analysis focuses on five major commodities (corn, soybeans, wheat, sorghum, and oats) accounting for 98 percent of ARC program base acres. Calculations were made on a county by county basis using published National Agricultural Statistics Service and Farm Service Agency yields for each commodity to analyze monetary changes to the program. Conclusions from the scenario results show that as geographical area boundaries get larger, ARC county payments become less variable across the country. Making payments on planted acres instead of base acres would have reduced commodity program spending by 258 million dollars in 2014 and 403 million dollars in 2015. If yields used in ARC calculations are restricted to a downside limit of 70 percent of t-yields producers will receive higher payments than if the limit is removed. There is no consistency across commodities in the relationship between payments and the use of either an Olympic average or simple average in calculating revenue benchmarks...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Japan is {{the largest}} market for U. S. forest {{products}}. Therefore, export of wood products to this country {{is critical to the}} economic life of the forest industry in the U. S. and particularly for the Pacific Northwest. Hence, economic conditions and developments in Japan may significantly affect the volume of trade for the products of concern and, in turn, the well-being of the U. S. lumber and log production-consumption system. Few studies have addressed forest product trade between the U. S. and Japan. This study is designed to determine the effect of several selected market factors on the Japanese import demand for U. S. softwood lumber and logs and to estimate the influence of these factors on Japan's future trade. A numerical model was developed incorporating these selective factors, thought to be relevant, to determine their effects on the Japanese market for the U. S. forest products. The evaluation considers the effects of variations in: Japanese income, domestic production of softwood logs in Japan, domestic prices of the products of concern, petroleum purchased by Japan, nominal interest rates in Japan, the exchange rates, and finally a weighted <b>average</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> of the products from the Pacific Northwest (Oregon and Washington, only). Given the available resources, two empirical time series models for each commodity were estimated by OLS technique using annual data from 1961 through 1985. The results indicate that the Japanese import demands for both products are inelastic. This finding, along with other evidence, suggests the distortion of the Japanese import demand for U. S. forest products by factors other than economic, mainly politics involved in trade restraint between the two countries. The study shows that GNP per capita, housing starts, and the interest rates in Japan, significantly affect the Japanese import demand for lumber from the U. S. Housing starts is the only significant factor {{in the case of the}} Japanese import demand for U. S. logs. In the latter case, the exchange rates and log export prices to Japan (deflated by Japan's wholesale price index), are significant only when the log linear model has been applied...|$|E
40|$|Prion {{diseases}} {{have raised}} concerns in consumer’s minds about food safety associated with meat world-wide. Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) and Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) both exist in Canada and consumer markets for beef, bison, elk and deer {{may have been}} affected by the diseases. While numerous studies have examined Canadian consumer beef purchasing behavior in the presence of BSE (Lomeli (2005), John(2007)), no examination {{of the impact of the}} animal diseases on consumer behavior for households who consume bison, elk and venison as part of their protein intake has been undertaken. In this study, meat consumption behavior for these specific households is examined, in particular, examining meat substitution possibilities between the exotic meats and domestic meats such as beef, pork, chicken, turkey and seafood. CWD was discovered on a Canadian elk farm in 1996 (CFIA) and since has been found on deer and elk farms and in the wild in Saskatchewan and Alberta. While to date no bison have been found with BSE, many of the trade bans put in place at the time of BSE have affected the bison market and consumers may associate bison with BSE through media coverage of the disease and trade barriers. In addition to examining the possible links between food safety concerns and consumption, the demographic characteristics of the households who consume exotic meats, and their responses to relative prices and other economic variables are modelled. No other empirical study exists on Canadian revealed meat purchasing behavior focused on these specific meats. Hobbs et al (2006) examined the potential market for bison in Canada. There are a number of past studies investigating the impact of food safety information reported in the media and product recalls on food demand. For many recent studies of consumers’ behavior associated with meat demand and food safety concerns, the linear approximate almost-ideal demand system (AIDS) model has been popular and used. In this study, the behaviour of selected households that include bison, elk and venison meat as part of their total meat consumption will be examined. The revealed impact of BSE and CWD incidences on these household’s behavior will be examined using a linear approximate almost-ideal demand system (LA/AIDS) model. Using theoretical concepts, model development can be explained as follow. First the usual LA/AIDS budget share demand functions using a Stone price index to avoid non-linearity are developed. To represent a system of demand functions, a set of three theoretical restrictions – homogeneity, symmetry and adding-up – are imposed and tested. To capture the influence of demographic and food safety factors, like BSE and CWD incidence, on meat consumption, Pollak and Wales (1981) proposed linking the demographic characteristics to the AIDS model as translation tools (Jones et al, 2003). Therefore, following the demographic translating method, demographic data and BSE, CWD media information (collected from tracking print media coverage of the two animal diseases from a national newspaper, in this case from the “Globe and Mail (Canada) ”) are incorporated into the LA/AIDS model and the extended demand function can be expressed as follows:, where, is the budget (expenditure) share of the ith good; is the intercept net of demographic and food safety effects; is the demographic variables and food safety media indices; are the prices deflated by CPI; and ln Y is the log of total expenditure. In this study, eight types of meats – Bison, Elk, Venison, Beef, Pork, Chicken, Turkey, and Seafood – are used and from the adding up property of the LA/AIDS demand system, one expenditure share equation (seafood) from the system is excluded. Using full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation procedures, the above equations are estimated simultaneously. This study used annually aggregated Homescan™ household data (ACNielsen) for the years 2002 to 2008. The price data for bison, elk and venison are from ACNielsen Market TRack. Bison prices are computed as an average of retail prices of ground bison, roast bison and steak bison. For elk and venison, the annual average retail price of all types of elk and venison are calculated. Since there are no regional price indices for bison, elk and venison, the prices used for bison, elk and venison are the same for all provinces. Chicken and turkey regional retail prices are obtained through Agriculture and Agri-food Canada (AAFC) web page. For beef and pork, national retail prices are derived as follows: the national retail prices of beef are computed as an <b>average</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> of round steak, sirloin steak, prime rib roast, blade roast, stewing beef and ground beef. The national retail price of pork is approximated by the price of pork chops. In the next step, regional beef and pork retail prices are calculated by multiplying national retail prices of beef and pork with the regional price indices of beef and pork divided by the national price indices of beef and pork. The media coverage for BSE and CWD cases were collected from the Globe and Mail (Canada) through Factiva. com’s search criteria. For the household demographic data, dummy variables are used for the data defined in index numbers, which are language, region, household size, age of children, education of household head, and location (rural or urban). The midpoints are used for demographic data defined in value terms, such as the age of household head and household income. Because households who consumed the above exotic meats are not the same in all years, an unbalanced panel data for 2002 to 2008 was used in this study. Among total households (9304) surveyed by ACNielsen in 2006, only 7. 4 percent consumed these exotic meats. If the sample for 2006 in the analysis is compared to the total population from 2006 census of Canada, for example, the sample contains 66 (34) percent of households with size less than or equal to 2 members (greater than or equal to 3 members), while 2006 census population exhibits a breakdown of 60 (40) percent. Similarly, for the sample, data on children’s age and being present in the family, the sample contains 30 (71) percent for the presence of children 18 years and under (none), which is a close representation of the 2006 census population of 26 (74) percent. Meat expenditure shares for bison (3 %), elk (2 %) and venison (2 %) are relatively low as compared to those of beef (35 %), pork (18 %), chicken (26 %), turkey (6 %) and seafood (7 %) in the 2006 surveyed data. However, a significant increasing trend in expenditure share from 2002 to 2008 can be observed for bison (2 to 4 percent), elk and venison (0. 6 to 3 percent). A decreasing trend in beef (41 to 34 percent), pork (19 to 17 percent), chicken (27 to 25 percent), and a slightly increasing trend for turkey (4 to 5 percent) and seafood (5 to 8 percent) are also observed for the sampled households. Therefore, exotic meat types are tending to be consumed slightly more replacing domestic meat types beef, pork and chicken. From the results, it can be observed that all the own price elasticities have negative signs and expenditure elasticities have positive signs as a priori expectation showing the right curvature of underlying expenditure function and downward sloping demand (expenditure share) functions. Since the expenditure elasticities for beef, pork and chicken are slightly greater than 1, we may say that they are normal good to slightly luxury goods. Seafood, turkey, bison, elk and venison are normal to necessity goods. More interesting factors can be figured out from the results of demographic characteristics and BSE/CWD media indices. For example, 1) preferences for meat types are different across provinces; 2) pork and turkey are preferred by more English speaking people than French speaking people; 3) the larger the household size, the more elk and venison will be consumed; 4) the households with children under 18 consume less beef and more chicken; 5) elk, venison and turkey consumption increase and beef consumption decreases as income increases; 6) higher educated household heads choose more chicken, seafood and less elk, venison and pork; 7) urban people prefer more pork and less seafood; and 8) consumption will switch from beef/bison to elk/venison/turkey at the time of BSE reports and vice versa for CWD reports.
