25|$|The first Richard and Linda Thompson album, I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight, was {{recorded}} in May 1973 in short time and on a small budget. Largely because of the petrol shortage in Britain <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> availability of vinyl for records, Bright Lights was held back by Island Records {{for nearly a year}} before being released in April 1974. The album was well received by the critics, though sales were less than stellar.|$|E

25|$|ExxonMobil {{has been}} criticized for its slow {{response}} to cleanup efforts after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, widely considered {{to be one of the}} world's worst oil spills in terms of damage to the environment. ExxonMobil has a history of lobbying for climate change denial and against the scientific consensus that global warming is caused by the burning of fossil fuels.

25|$|The {{technique}} uses normal incident plane {{waves in}} a shaped spectrum of acoustic noise to impact directly on all exposed test article surfaces without external boundary reflections. Depending on {{the geometry of}} the test article this could produce magnitude variations on surfaces due to phasing differences between the plane waves. In the case of large surface area, low mass density test articles the phasing difference may excite primary structure modes {{in a different way}} than more conventional reverberant-field testing. This fundamental difference <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> structure must be weighed against the advantages of the DFAT method.|$|E
25|$|The Tax Reform Act of 1986 <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{alternative}} {{minimum tax}} (AMT) reduced nominal rates on the wealthy and eliminated tax deductions, while raising tax rates on lower-income individuals. The across the board tax system reduced marginal rates and further reduced bracket creep from inflation. The highest income earners (with incomes exceeding $1,000,000) received a tax break, restoring a flatter tax system. In 2006, the IRS's National Taxpayer Advocate's report characterized the effective rise in the AMT for individuals as {{a problem with the}} tax code. Through 2007, the revised AMT had brought in more tax revenue than the former tax code, which has made it difficult for Congress to reform.|$|E

25|$|The main {{benefit of}} mycorrhizas to plants has been {{attributed}} to increased uptake of nutrients, especially phosphorus. This may be due to increased surface area in contact with soil, increased movement of nutrients into mycorrhizae, a modified root environment, and increased storage. Mycorrhizas can be much more efficient than plant roots at taking up phosphorus. Phosphorus travels to the root or via diffusion and hyphae reduce the distance required for diffusion, thus increasing uptake. The rate of phosphorus flowing into mycorrhizae can be up to six times that of the root hairs. In some cases, the role of phosphorus uptake can be completely taken over by the mycorrhizal network, and all of the plant’s phosphorus may be of hyphal origin. Less is known about the role of nitrogen nutrition in the arbuscular mycorrhizal system <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> symbiosis and community. While significant advances have been made in elucidating the mechanisms of this complex interaction, much investigation remains to be done.|$|E
25|$|IU School of Medicine is {{a leader}} in the research, diagnosis, {{treatment}} and rehabilitation of traumatic brain injury and mild traumatic brain injury, known also as concussion. In 2012, federal officials designated IU School of Medicine and the Rehabilitation Hospital of Indiana as a Traumatic Brain Injury Model System site, marking the partnership center as a national leader in TBI-related care and research. As only one of 16 such sites in the United States, the center received a five-year, $2 million grant to add researchers and physicians to the initiative of studying and treating traumatic brain injury <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lives of patients and their families. The center offers the highest level of comprehensive and multidisciplinary rehabilitation care and adds to national capacity for high-quality treatment and research for people with TBI. IU School of Medicine is also a leading member of the NCAA and U.S. Department of Defense CARE Consortium, a $30 million initiative to study concussions among student athletes and use that knowledge to improve safety and health of athletes, military service members and the general public. CARE Consortium research includes exploration post-concussive symptoms, performance and psychological health of student athletes and the analysis of data related to biomechanical, clinical, neuroimaging, neurobiological and genetic markers of injury. This work represents the largest and most comprehensive concussion study to date.|$|E
