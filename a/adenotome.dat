40|$|After {{evaluating}} approaches proposed, {{over the}} last few years, by several Authors, to make the procedure of adenoidectomy safer and more accurate, we have developed a new procedure based on the combined use of a rigid 70 ° endoscope with a video attachment and a microdebrider, both introduced through the oral cavity. This procedure offers several advantages: an improved field of vision, continuous suction of blood, and extreme precision in removing the adenoid tissue. Compared with current practices which employ the <b>adenotome</b> or curette, it is possible with our approach to remove adenoid tissue in the most important centres: the choanal and tubaric regions. The validity and safety of this videoendoscopic adenoidectomy with microdebrider has been demonstrated in 201 patients...|$|E

The conventional curettage adenoidectomy was first described in 1885 (Thornval 1969), {{and since then}} it has been considered {{the most commonly used}} surgical technique for adenoidectomy (Costantini et al. 2008). Conventional curettage for removing adenoids uses the nasopharyngeal touch method to estimate the size of the adenoid and the relationship to the surrounding structure, in order to choose the suitable adenoidectomy curette to scrape the adenoid tissue in the rhinopharynx transorally behind the nose.|$|R
