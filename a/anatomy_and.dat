5|$|A typical female {{vampire bat}} weighs 40grams and can consume over 20grams (1 fluid ounce) {{of blood in}} a 20-minute feed.

5|$|Building {{upon the}} gene-chromosome theory of {{heredity}} that originated with Gregor Mendel (1822–1884), August Weismann (1834–1914) proved that inheritance only takes place through gametes. No other cells can pass on inherited characters. The work of Katherine Esau (1898–1997) on plant anatomy {{is still a}} major foundation of modern botany. Her books Plant <b>Anatomy</b> <b>and</b> Anatomy of Seed Plants have been key plant structural biology texts {{for more than half}} a century.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{students}} of certain biological sciences, paramedics, prosthetists and orthotists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurses, podiatrists, and medical students learn gross <b>anatomy</b> <b>and</b> microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials, and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadavers. The study of microscopic anatomy (or histology) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under a microscope.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{all living}} things were {{classified}} as either animals or plants and botany covered the study of all organisms not considered animals. Botanists examine both the internal functions and processes within plant organelles, cells, tissues, whole plants, plant populations and plant communities. At each of these levels, a botanist may be concerned with the classification (taxonomy), phylogeny and evolution, structure (<b>anatomy</b> <b>and</b> morphology), or function (physiology) of plant life.|$|E

5|$|In December 1883, a male {{humpback}} swam up the Firth of Tay in Scotland, past {{what was}} then the whaling port of Dundee. The whale was exhibited to the public by a local entrepreneur, John Woods, both locally and then as a touring exhibition that travelled to Edinburgh and London. The whale was dissected by Professor John Struthers, who wrote seven papers on its <b>anatomy</b> <b>and</b> an 1889 monograph on the humpback.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{looking to}} become {{forensic}} anthropologists first obtain a bachelor's degree in anthropology from an accredited university.

5|$|Le Règne Animal (The Animal Kingdom) is {{the most}} famous work of the French naturalist Georges Cuvier. It sets out to {{describe}} the natural structure of {{the whole of the}} animal kingdom based on comparative <b>anatomy,</b> <b>and</b> its natural history. Cuvier divided the animals into four embranchements ("Branches", roughly corresponding to phyla), namely vertebrates, molluscs, articulated animals (arthropods and annelids), and zoophytes (cnidaria and other phyla).|$|E

Over 1,000 specimens have been identified, though less than half are complete enough to give researchers good information on the anatomy of the animal.

5|$|Scholars of {{the medieval}} Islamic world who wrote on biology {{included}} al-Jahiz (781–869), Al-Dīnawarī (828–896), who wrote on botany, and Rhazes (865–925) who wrote on <b>anatomy</b> <b>and</b> physiology. Medicine was especially well studied by Islamic scholars working in Greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew heavily on Aristotelian thought, especially in upholding a fixed hierarchy of life.|$|E
5|$|The Hellenistic Egyptian city of Alexandria was the stepping-stone for Greek <b>anatomy</b> <b>and</b> physiology. Alexandria {{not only}} housed the biggest library for medical records and {{books of the}} liberal arts in the world {{during the time of}} the Greeks, but was also home to many medical {{practitioners}} and philosophers. Great patronage of the arts and sciences from the Ptolemy rulers helped raise Alexandria up, further rivalling the cultural and scientific achievements of other Greek states.|$|E
40|$|Gene {{expression}} {{patterns are}} a key feature in understanding gene function, notably in development. Comparing gene expression patterns between animals is a major step {{in the study of}} gene function as well as of animal evolution. It also provides a link between genes and phenotypes. Thus we have developed Bgee, a database designed to compare expression patterns between animals, by implementing ontologies describing <b>anatomies</b> <b>and</b> developmental stages of species, and then designing homology relationships between <b>anatomies</b> <b>and</b> comparison criteria between developmental stages. To define homology relationships between anatomical features we have developed the software Homolonto, which uses a modified ontology alignment approach to propose homology relationships between ontologies. Bgee then uses these aligned ontologies, onto which heterogeneous expression data types are mapped. These already include microarrays and ESTs...|$|R

5|$|The {{discipline}} of anatomy can be subdivided {{into a number}} of branches including gross or macroscopic <b>anatomy</b> <b>and</b> microscopic anatomy. Gross anatomy is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and also includes superficial anatomy or surface anatomy, the study by sight of the external body features. Microscopic anatomy is the study of structures on a microscopic scale, including histology (the study of tissues), and embryology (the study of an organism in its immature condition).|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} humans {{must have}} had and passed on knowledge about plants and animals to increase their chances of survival. This may have included knowledge of human and animal <b>anatomy</b> <b>and</b> aspects of animal behavior (such as migration patterns). However, the first major turning point in biological knowledge came with the Neolithic Revolution about 10,000 years ago. Humans first domesticated plants for farming, then livestock animals to accompany the resulting sedentary societies.|$|E

Along with a carnivorous killer on the sea, Amity is populated with equally predatory humans: the mayor has ties with the mafia, an adulterous housewife, criminals among the tourists.|$|E

In their reflection of classical antiquity they resonate with Pope Julius' aspirations to lead Italy towards a new 'age of gold'; at the same time, they staked Michelangelo's claim to greatness.

5|$|A {{suitable}} environment {{had developed}} to question scientific doctrine. The discovery in 1492 of the New World by Christopher Columbus challenged the classical worldview. The works of Ptolemy (in geography) and Galen (in medicine) {{were found to}} not always match everyday observations. As the Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation clashed, the Northern Renaissance showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristotelean natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, <b>anatomy,</b> <b>and</b> medicine). The willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers resulted {{in a period of}} major scientific advancements.|$|E
