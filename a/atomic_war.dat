25|$|Nineteen Eighty-Four, George Orwell's dystopian 1949 {{novel about}} life after a Third World War, rose to {{cultural}} {{prominence in the}} 1950s. In it, the world has endured a massive <b>atomic</b> <b>war</b> and is politically divided into three totalitarian superstates, which are intentionally locked into a perpetual military stalemate; this never-ending warfare is used to subjugate their respective populations.|$|E
25|$|The {{annexation}} of Britain occurred {{about the same}} time as the <b>atomic</b> <b>war</b> that provoked civil war, but who fought whom in the war is left unclear. Nuclear weapons fell on Britain; an atomic bombing of Colchester is referenced in the text. Exactly how Ingsoc and its rival systems (Neo-Bolshevism and Death Worship) gained power in their respective countries is also unclear.|$|E

25|$|In 1984, {{there is}} a {{perpetual}} war between Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia, the superstates {{that emerged from the}} global <b>atomic</b> <b>war.</b> The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism, by Emmanuel Goldstein, explains that each state is so strong it cannot be defeated, even with the combined forces of two superstates, despite changing alliances. To hide such contradictions, history is rewritten to explain that the (new) alliance always was so; the populaces are accustomed to doublethink and accept it. The war is not fought in Oceanian, Eurasian or Eastasian territory but in the Arctic wastes and in a disputed zone comprising the sea and land from Tangiers (Northern Africa) to Darwin (Australia). At the start, Oceania and Eastasia are allies fighting Eurasia in northern Africa and the Malabar Coast.|$|E
25|$|The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists is a nontechnical online {{magazine}} {{that has been}} published continuously since 1945, when it was founded by former Manhattan Project physicists after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Bulletins primary aim is {{to inform the public}} about nuclear policy debates while advocating for the international control of nuclear weapons. One of the driving forces behind the creation of the Bulletin was the amount of public interest surrounding atomic energy {{at the dawn of the}} atomic age. In 1945 the public interest in atomic warfare and weaponry inspired contributors to the Bulletin to attempt to inform those interested about the dangers and destruction that <b>atomic</b> <b>war</b> could bring about. In the 1950s, the Bulletin was involved in the formation of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, annual conferences of scientists concerned about nuclear proliferation.|$|E
500|$|The {{contents}} of the letter were not new, and some had been known when Oppenheimer was first cleared for <b>atomic</b> <b>war</b> work. Yet that information had not prompted anyone to seek his removal from government service. Despite the lack of new evidence, Eisenhower ordered that a [...] "blank wall" [...] be placed between Oppenheimer and the nation's atomic secrets.|$|E

This linked ABC Warriors to Judge Dredd, {{in addition to}} the existing Satanus connection. (This link was retconned away in other strips.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Following the <b>Atomic</b> <b>Wars</b> of 2070 {{most of the}} United States {{became a}} {{radioactive}} wasteland. With only the three Mega-Cities surviving (on the East Coast, California, and Texas), {{the remainder of the}} country became known as the [...] "Cursed Earth". Although considered unfit for human habitation, the Cursed Earth is populated by all manner of creatures, scraping a living in a tough environment. Since the <b>Atomic</b> <b>Wars,</b> genetic mutations appeared, but mutants are banned from living in the cities, so they are forced to make their homes in the Cursed Earth. The communities are mostly poor, rural groupings with no industry, often dominated by quasi-religious movements. In more extreme cases, these communities become cults organised well enough to threaten Mega-City One as a revenge for the way the city has treated these outcasts.|$|R
500|$|When Browne {{took over}} {{at the start of}} 1950, William Hamling was doing most of the {{editorial}} work. Browne did not fully take control of the magazine {{until the end of the}} year, when Hamling and Palmer both left Ziff-Davis; the quality of the fiction promptly improved at that point, and the first year or two of Browne's tenure are regarded as the high point of Fantastic Adventures run. Theodore Sturgeon's novel The Dreaming Jewels appeared in February 1950, and Lester del Rey, William Tenn and Walter M. Miller all published notable material. In April 1950, Mack Reynolds' first story, [...] "Isolationist", appeared in Fantastic Adventures. Reynolds became more strongly associated with Astounding Science Fiction than with the Ziff-Davis magazines, but some of the radical political themes of his later work are evident in [...] "Isolationist". The story describes helpful alien visitors abandoning Earth to <b>atomic</b> <b>war</b> because of the hostility of the first Earthman they encounter. John Jakes also debuted in Fantastic Adventures that year, with [...] "The Dreaming Trees", in November 1950.|$|E
2500|$|On the Beach (1957) [...] [...] Shute's best-known novel, {{is set in}} Melbourne, whose {{population}} is awaiting death {{from the effects of}} an <b>atomic</b> <b>war.</b> It was serialised in more than 40 newspapers, and adapted into a 1959 film starring Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner. In 2007, Gideon Haigh wrote an article in The Monthly arguing that On the Beach is Australia's most important novel: [...] "Most novels of apocalypse posit at least a group of survivors and the semblance of hope. On The Beach allows nothing of the kind." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{the precise}} {{chronology}} cannot be traced, {{most of the}} global societal reorganization occurred between 1945 and the early 1960s. Winston and Julia once meet {{in the ruins of}} a church that was destroyed in a nuclear attack [...] "thirty years" [...] earlier, which suggests 1954 as the year of the <b>atomic</b> <b>war</b> that destabilised society and allowed the Party to seize power. It is stated in the novel that the [...] "fourth quarter of 1983" [...] was [...] "also the sixth quarter of the Ninth Three-Year Plan", which implies that {{the first quarter of the}} first three-year plan began in July 1958. By then, the Party was apparently in control of Oceania.|$|E
50|$|New Jerusalem (north-east Ethiopia): {{megacity}} {{stated in}} Pan-Africa map {{to be the}} capital of Ethiope (see below), and the new Jewish homeland after the loss of Israel in the <b>Atomic</b> <b>Wars.</b> Briefly entered into a trade agreement with Mega-City One in 2111. Has Christian paramilitaries, who in 2117 had backing from InterDep.|$|R
50|$|He first {{appeared}} in The Cursed Earth epic set in the year 2100. After dying in the Cretaceous era his DNA had been found {{and he had been}} cloned for the Dinosaur National Park. Unfortunately the <b>Atomic</b> <b>Wars</b> set the creature loose. The plot line of the Dinosaur National Park was used 12 years later by Michael Chrichton on his novel Jurassic Park (1990).|$|R
5000|$|The Medusa Seed {{includes}} {{the only explanation}} in any Judge Dredd story {{of the origins of}} people with psionic abilities, such as members of Justice Department's Psi Division (since [...] "psis" [...] existed before the <b>Atomic</b> <b>Wars</b> and are therefore not mutations created by the ensuing radiation). Psis are said to be the product of illegal medical experiments on children during the 20th century by the US National Security Agency.|$|R
2500|$|Schweitzer {{was awarded}} the Nobel Peace Prize of 1952, and his {{acceptance}} speech, [...] "The Problem of Peace", {{is considered one of}} the best speeches ever given. From 1952 until his death he worked against nuclear tests and nuclear weapons with Albert Einstein, Otto Hahn and Bertrand Russell. In 1957 and 1958 he broadcast four speeches over Radio Oslo which were published in Peace or <b>Atomic</b> <b>War.</b> In 1957, Schweitzer was one of the founders of The Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy. On 23 April 1957, Schweitzer made his [...] "Declaration of Conscience" [...] speech; it was broadcast to the world over Radio Oslo, pleading for the abolition of nuclear weapons. His speech ended, [...] "The end of further experiments with atom bombs would be like the early sunrays of hope which suffering humanity is longing for." ...|$|E

50|$|Megacities in the Judge Dredd comics are {{a fictional}} exaggeration {{of the real}} {{megacity}} concept: instead of just being a large conurbation, they cover most of their original country and have replaced nations as the dominant political entity. The most commonly seen megacity is Mega-City One. In the strip, these cities are {{all that remains of}} their original countries after the <b>Atomic</b> <b>Wars</b> of 2070, and are mostly dictatorships run by the Judges.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origin of}} Justice Department and Brit-Cit's history is also contradictory. Dave Stone's version was that Brit-Cit was a [...] "global irrelevance" [...] {{by the time}} of the <b>Atomic</b> <b>Wars</b> and only faced {{fall-out}} rather than a direct assault as it wasn't worth bombing; Justice Department only existed after the fallout and resulting civil war, and was created solely by organised crime for aid. [...] "Hardly anyone else on the job agrees with me." ...|$|R
50|$|In the Judge Dredd comic stories Mutants {{are caused}} by the effects of {{radiation}} after the <b>Atomic</b> <b>Wars.</b> All Mutants are banned from Mega-City One and are deported into the Cursed Earth Wasteland. This policy has left the mutants resentful and they often attack the city. Dredd himself has voiced doubts about the policy and when on duty in the Cursed Earth treats mutants the same as any other beings. He will however carry out the law when they enter the city.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is hard to}} say. Friendship between alien intelligences is an imponderable. They are not dangerous, I think. We've {{come across}} other groups that could not {{maintain}} equilibrium after the <b>atomic</b> <b>war</b> stage {{and you know the}} results. Introversion. Retreat. Gradual decadence and increasing gentleness." ...|$|E
5000|$|We are {{preparing}} ourselves for {{a stage in}} which before the <b>atomic</b> <b>war</b> we shall struggle for power, during the <b>atomic</b> <b>war</b> we shall struggle for power and we shall be in power.

Simultaneous doesn't mean the same day and the same hour. Great historic events should not be measured by hours or days, but by periods… The working class will maintain itself, and will immediately have to seek its cohesion and centralisation… ...|$|E

50|$|After the <b>Atomic</b> <b>Wars</b> of 2070, Mega-City One {{was left}} in turmoil. As a result, Judd {{proposed}} a radical {{solution to the problem}} of policing an overcrowded city, packed with 400 million potential criminals. The solution was to clone the citizens, as well as the Judges, to create a docile and obedient population. Although he had some support amongst many of his colleagues, Chief Judge Fargo rejected the idea, pointing out that the Judges' first duty was to serve the citizens, not to control them.|$|R
5000|$|The city formed out of {{a growing}} urban sprawl and became {{partially}} self-governing under the Autonomy Act of 2052, with its own Chief Judge. It later became America's second city (nicknamed [...] "the Second Meg") after the <b>Atomic</b> <b>Wars</b> of 2070, which killed Chief Judge Gabe Suarez, and closely allied itself with Mega-City One and Texas City. The city would develop its own laws, culture, and aesthetics; this was depicted in Mega-City Two: City Of Courts (see below) {{which may or may}} not be in continuity.|$|R
