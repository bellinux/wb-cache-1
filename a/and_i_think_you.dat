I've had lots of friends who've gone through 'Battlefield' situations in their relationships, so when I was singing the song I put myself in their position and {{tried to imagine what}} they were going through. I got so, so into it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can tell.|$|E

You take a tin-can, the bigger the tin-can the better, like the family size ones that peach halves come in, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> cut them with scissors. It's very easy and you just make flowers out of them. My mother always had lots of cans around, including the soup cans.|$|E
500|$|After the Dawson College {{shooting}} in September 2006, when gunman Kimveer Gill killed one student and injured 19 others, the Toronto Sun wrote that Kimveer had self-reported playing Columbine Massacre {{on a web}} site. The story {{was picked up by}} media and reported widely. Upon hearing media reports of a link to the game one of the shooting victims at Dawson College contacted Ledonne and told him that [...] "I just suffered multiple gunshot wounds <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> should take this game down." [...] Ledonne expressed his reaction to the shooting and renewed media attention towards his game in an interview a week later: ...|$|E

500|$|How {{the demonstrations}} became violent is unclear.Interviewer: 您认为事件的过程已经非常清楚了吗？ (Do {{you think the}} process of the riots has become clear?)Bovingdon: 不清楚，而且我觉得可以说很不清楚。 (No, it's not clear, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can say it's much unclear.)}} Some say the police used {{excessive}} force against the protesters; the World Uyghur Congress quickly issued press releases saying that the police had used deadly force and killed [...] "scores" [...] of protesters. Kadeer has alleged that there were agents provocateurs among the crowds. Others claim that the protesters initiated the violence; for example, an Uyghur eyewitness cited by The New York Times said protesters began throwing rocks at the police. The government's official line was that the violence was not only initiated by the protesters, but also had been premeditated and coordinated by Uyghur separatists abroad. The local public security bureau said it found evidence that many Uyghurs had travelled from other cities to gather for the riot, and that they had begun preparing weapons two or three days before the riot.|$|E
500|$|In {{an impromptu}} {{interview}} following the match, a clearly upset Solo criticized Ryan's decision. [...] "It {{was the wrong}} decision, and I think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that. There's {{no doubt in my}} mind I would have made those saves. And the fact of the matter is it's not 2004 anymore. It's not 2004. And it's 2007, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have to live in the present. And you can't live by big names. You can't live in the past. It doesn't matter what somebody did in an Olympic gold medal game in the Olympics three years ago. Now is what matters, and that's what I think." [...] Many viewed her comments as being critical of Scurry's performance, although Solo released an apologetic statement the following day saying that was not her intent. On September 29, 2007, coach Greg Ryan announced that Solo would not be with the team and would not play in the third-place match against Norway the following day. Team captain Kristine Lilly stated that the decision on Solo was made by the team as a group. The U.S. went on to win against Norway 4–1.|$|E
500|$|Forgoing {{the closure}} favored by its contemporaries, Changelings final {{sequence}} reflects Collins' renewed hope that Walter is alive. The shot is a {{two and a}} half minute sequence showing Collins' walking off to become lost in a crowd. The sequence is representative of the range of effects that feature throughout the film; Los Angeles is presented as major character, brought to life by unobtrusive peripheral imagery that allows the viewer to focus on the story and the emotional cues. The [...] "hustle and bustle" [...] of the sequence was required to convey that downtown Los Angeles in 1935 was a congested urban center. In the closing shot, the camera tilts up to reveal miles of city blocks, pedestrians on the streets, cars going by and streetcars running along their tracks. The version of the film that screened at Cannes did not include this sequence; the scene faded to black as Collins walked away. The new 4,000-frame shot was Owens' idea. He felt the abrupt cut to black pulled the viewer out of the film too quickly, and that it left no room for emotional reflection. Owens said, [...] "There is a legend at the end before the credits. The legend speaks to what happened after the fact, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> need to just swallow that for a few moments with the visual still with you." [...] Owens told Eastwood the film should end like Chinatown(1974), in which the camera lifts to take in the scene: [...] "The camera booms up and she walks away from us from a very emotional, poignant scene at the end, walks away into this mass of people and traffic. It's very hopeful and sad at the same time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stephen Dorff portrays Hal Hartman, an unhinged Texas Ranger that pursues Leatherface and {{his family}} for revenge {{for the murder of}} his daughter. Dorff {{described}} Leatherface as a [...] "survival film for my character and a retribution film for Hartman, who I play. But it definitely has the moments of some sick stuff going on, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> realize that this family's not to be messed with. You want to stay clear away from the Sawyers and not confront them." ...|$|E

2500|$|After a brief tour, John K {{decided to}} rejoin Biomechanical full-time. In an interview, John said [...] "I found my self giving Biomechanical less that [...] 100% and {{that bothered me}} a lot... As a {{musician}} {{you have something to}} say <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can easily lose direction by playing in two or three bands. I personally find it disorientating and I would prefer to focus in my band only." [...] The decision was amicable and the band continued to work on other projects.|$|E

"Truman {{left the}} Presidency {{thinking}} that Whittaker Chambers, Elizabeth Bentley were nuts, crackpots, scoundrels, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{could say that}} a fissure began in American political life that's never really closed. It reverberates, and I can say more about it. But in the main, American liberalism—Arthur Schlesinger, one of the conspicuous examples—got it wrong. We were {{on the side of}} the people who denied this, and a president who could have changed his rhetoric, explained it, told the American people, didn't know the facts, they were secret, and they were kept from him."– Secrecy: The American Experience, October 1998 ...|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the album}} was released, the band half seriously {{considered}} titles of Half Dog, Animal Lover <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Think</b> <b>You</b> Stink, all were rejected in favour of Suede. The gender-ambiguous cover art provoked some controversy in the press, prompting Anderson to comment: [...] "I chose {{it because of the}} ambiguity of it, but mostly because of the beauty of it." [...] The cover image of the androgynous kissing couple was taken from the 1991 book Stolen Glances: Lesbians Take Photographs edited by Tessa Boffin and Jean Fraser. The photograph was taken by Tee Corinne and in its entirety shows a woman kissing an acquaintance in a wheelchair.|$|E

2500|$|Actor Shia LaBeouf was unimpressed {{with the}} film, stating [...] "We got lost. We {{tried to get}} bigger. It's what happens to sequels. It's like, how do you top the first one? You've got to go bigger. Michael Bay went so big that it became too big, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> lost the anchor of the movie...You lost {{a bit of the}} relationships. Unless you have those relationships, then the movie doesn't matter. Then it's just a bunch of robots {{fighting}} each other." [...] Bay has admitted his disappointment with the film and has apologized, saying the film was [...] "crap" [...] and blaming the 2007–2008 Writers' Strike, saying [...] "It was very hard to put (the sequel) together that quickly after the writers' strike (of 2007–08)".|$|E
2500|$|The {{death penalty}} was a notable issue during the 1988 presidential election. It {{came up in}} the October 13, 1988, debate between the two presidential nominees George H. W. Bush and Michael Dukakis, when Bernard Shaw, the {{moderator}} of the debate, asked Dukakis, [...] "Governor, if Kitty Dukakis [...] were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?" [...] Dukakis replied, [...] "No, I don't, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime." [...] Bush was elected, and many, including Dukakis himself, cite the statement as {{the beginning of the end}} of his campaign.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to these, a Hall of Fame chief executive said, [...] "The definition of 'rock and roll' means {{different things to}} different people, but as broad as the classifications may be, they all share a common love of the music." [...] Roger Glover remains ambivalent about induction and got an inside word from the Hall, [...] "One of the jurors said, ‘You know, Deep Purple, they’re just one-hit wonders.’ How can you deal with that kind of Philistinism, you know?". Ian Gillan also commented, [...] "I've fought all my life against being institutionalised <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have to actively search these things out, in other words mingle with the right people, and we don't get invited to those kind of things." [...] On 16 October 2013 Deep Purple were again announced as nominees for inclusion to the Hall, and once again they were not inducted.|$|E
