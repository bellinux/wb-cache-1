During his first game in a Valencia shirt, an Intertoto Cup match against Belgian outfit Gent, Villa scored the first goal in a game which Valencia won 2–0. He made his league debut for Valencia coming on as a substitute against Real Betis in a 1–0 win on 27 August 2005.

5|$|All the {{interesting}} cases of homotopy groups of spheres involve mappings from a higher-dimensional sphere {{onto one of}} lower dimension. Unfortunately, the only example which can easily be visualized is not interesting: there are no nontrivial mappings from the ordinary sphere to the circle. Hence, π2(S1) = 0. This is because S1 has the real line as its universal cover which is contractible (it has the homotopy type of <b>a</b> <b>point).</b> <b>In</b> addition, because S2 is simply connected, by the lifting criterion, any map from S2 to S1 can be lifted to a map into the real line and the nullhomotopy descends to the downstairs space.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} {{concept in}} Hippocratic medicine {{was that of}} a crisis, <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover. After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur on critical days, which were supposed to be a fixed time after the contraction of a disease. If a crisis occurred on a day far from a critical day, a relapse might be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{having a}} {{disrupted}} pre-season {{due to his}} participation in Euro 2012, Ben Arfa enjoyed a good start to the new Premier League season. On the opening weekend of the season he won and converted a penalty that gave Newcastle a 2–1 victory over Tottenham. Two weeks later he scored with a spectacular 25-yard drive, on his weaker right foot, to earn Newcastle <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> a 1–1 draw against Aston Villa. He injured his hamstring during December, and made his comeback against Anzhi Makhachkala in the Europa League on 7 March 2013, his 26th birthday. He then developed an injury which {{kept him out of}} the team until the second leg of the Europa League quarter final against Benfica on the 11 April 2013 when he came on as a second-half substitute. Ben Arfa scored the equaliser in a 2–1 away win at Loftus Road from the penalty spot as Newcastle confirmed their Premier League status for the next season.|$|E

5000|$|At {{this point}} we can apply the method of the Cantor-Bernstein-Schroeder theorem. This theorem tells us that if we have an {{injection}} from set D to set E (such as from the big figure to the <b>A</b> type <b>points</b> <b>in</b> it), and <b>an</b> injection from E to D (such as the identity mapping from the <b>A</b> type <b>points</b> <b>in</b> the figure to themselves), {{then there is a}} one-to-one correspondence between D and E. In other words, having a mapping from the big figure to a subset of the <b>A</b> <b>points</b> <b>in</b> it, we can make a mapping (a bijection) from the big figure to all the <b>A</b> <b>points</b> <b>in</b> it. (<b>In</b> some regions <b>points</b> are mapped to themselves, in others they are mapped using the mapping described in the previous paragraph.) Likewise we can make a mapping from the big figure to all the B <b>points</b> <b>in</b> it. So looking at this the other way round, we can separate the figure into its <b>A</b> and B <b>points,</b> and then map each of these back into the whole figure (that is, containing both kinds of points)! ...|$|R

According to Reggae archivist Roger Steffens, the tape—which was lost among Norman's possessions for decades—is rare for Marley in that it was influenced by pop music rather than reggae, highlighting <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> Marley's career when he was still trying to find his path.

Smith was selected for his first All-Star Game but did not fare well, surrendering the final two runs in the American League's 13–3 rout. Although the Cubs continued losing, Smith finished with a career-best 1.65 ERA—more than two points below the league average—and a career-best 1.074 WHIP while leading the National League with 29 saves and 56 games finished.
