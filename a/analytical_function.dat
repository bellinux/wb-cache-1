40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} a {{subspace}} S of the space of real <b>analytical</b> <b>functions</b> on a manifold that satisfies certain regularity properties is contained in the set of solutions of a linear elliptic differential equation. The regularity properties are that S is closed in L 2 (M) and that if a sequence of functions fn in S converges in L 2 (M), then so do the partial derivatives of the functions fn. Keywords. Elliptic regularity; real-analytic manifolds; hypoelliptic. The limit f of a sequence fn of complex <b>analytical</b> <b>functions</b> (under uniform convergence on compact sets) is complex analytical. Furthermore all partial derivatives of fn converge to the corresponding partial derivatives of f. This {{is in contrast to}} the case of real <b>analytical</b> <b>functions.</b> In fact, by the Weierstrass approximation theorem, every continuous real function on a compact domain is the uniform limit of real <b>analytical</b> <b>functions</b> on this domain. The reason for the contrast between the complex and the real analytical cases is of course that complex <b>analytical</b> <b>functions</b> satisfy an elliptic differential equation, namely the Cauchy–Riemann equation (or alternatively because they satisfy the Laplace equation), while no such equation is satisfied in the analytical case. Here we show that this phenomenon is universal, namely, whenever we have a class S of (real <b>analytical)</b> <b>functions</b> on a closed manifold M that have regularity properties similar to those of holomorphic functions, all functions in f ∈ S satisfy an elliptic differential equation P f = 0. Our motivation is that in many geometric situations rigidity phenomena are associated with elliptic operators which are often hidden, i. e., not a priori related to the geometry. Two striking instances of this are the Seiberg–Witten equations for smooth fourdimensional manifolds and J-holomorphic curves in Symplectic topology. Hence it is of interest to show that there are situations where there must be elliptic operators, even though they are not a priori present. First we recall the definition of the Sobolev spaces W 2,k where k ≥ 0 is an integer. We will not need the general case when k ∈ R...|$|R
