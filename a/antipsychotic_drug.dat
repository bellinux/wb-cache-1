25|$|Clozapine is {{classified}} as an atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drug</b> because it binds to serotonin as well as dopamine receptors.|$|E
25|$|Clozapine is an {{atypical}} <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drug</b> primarily used {{in people}} who are unresponsive to or intolerant to other antipsychotics. This means that they have failed {{to respond satisfactorily to}} at least two different antipsychotics. It {{has been shown to be}} more effective in reducing symptoms of schizophrenia than typical antipsychotics, with more pronounced effects in those who have responded poorly to other medication.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> {{have been}} shown to protect PC 12 cells from cell death induced by a variety of stimuli in culture. Recently, it has been {{postulated}} that trophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), play a role in preventing cell death. It has been shown that <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> attenuate the decrease in rat hippocampal BDNF that results from immobilization-induced stress. We aimed to determine whether the neuroprotective effects of <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> could be mediated through glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Methods: We investigated the effects of the atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> quetiapine and clozapine and the typical antipsychotic haloperidol on the secretion of GDNF from rat C 6 glioma cells. Results: All 3 drugs increased the amount of GDNF secreted from C 6 glioma cells into the medium after 48 -hour culture. The intracellular content of GDNF was not altered by treatment with any of the <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs.</b> None of the <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> decreased cell number. Conclusion: This study suggests that stimulation of GDNF release from glial cells by <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> might underlie some of their neuroprotective properties in situ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Recently, an {{increased}} risk of venous thromboembolism in patients on <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> has been reported, but the molecular etiology is still unknown. Most <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> act as dopamine antagonists, and some of them cause hyperprolactinemia. Hyperprolactinemia has recently been found to cause increased platelet activation via potentiating ADP effects on human platelets. We assessed prolactin values as well as ADP-stimulated and thrombin receptor activator 6 -stimulated expression of the platelet activation marker P-selectin in 20 consecutive patients under therapy with <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs.</b> We detected a significant correlation between prolactin values and ADP-stimulated P-selectin expression on platelets in patients on <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs,</b> revealing a significant higher platelet stimulation in hyperprolactinemic patients on <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> than in normoprolactinemic controls...|$|R
40|$|Mechanisms {{of action}} of several {{atypical}} <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> {{have been examined}} at the D- 2 dopamine receptor expressed in CHO cells. The drugs tested were found to exhibit inverse agonist activity at the D- 2 dopamine receptor based on their effects to potentiate forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation. Each of the <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> tested (clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone) increased cAMP accumulation to the same extent. The increase in cAMP was also similar to that seen with typical <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs.</b> Inverse agonism at the D- 2 dopamine receptor seems, therefore, to be a property common to all classes of <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs.</b> The effect of sodium ions on the binding of the drugs to the receptor was also assessed. Each of the atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> tested here bound with higher affinity {{in the absence of}} sodium ions. Previous studies have shown that some <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> are insensitive to sodium ions and some bind with higher affinity in the presence of sodium ions. Given that all of these <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> are inverse agonists, it may be concluded that this sodium ion sensitivity is unrelated to mechanisms of inverse agonism.

25|$|A {{failure to}} notice {{withdrawal}} symptoms {{may be due}} to the relatively long half life of the drug resulting in the extremely slow excretion from the body. However, there are reports of muscular discomfort, exaggeration of psychotic symptoms and movement disorders, and difficulty sleeping when the <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drug</b> is suddenly withdrawn, but after years of normal doses these effects are not normally seen.|$|E
25|$|Buspirone {{was first}} synthesized, {{by a team}} at Mead Johnson, in 1968, but was not {{patented}} until 1975. It was initially developed as an <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drug</b> acting on the D2 receptor, but {{was found to be}} ineffective in the treatment of psychosis and was repurposed as an anxiolytic. In 1986, Bristol-Myers Squibb gained FDA approval for buspirone in the treatment of GAD. The patent placed on buspirone expired in 2001 and it is now available as a generic drug.|$|E
25|$|The {{daily dose}} of {{reserpine}} in antihypertensive treatment is as low as 0.1 to 0.25mg. The use of reserpine as an <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drug</b> had been nearly completely abandoned, but more recently it made a comeback as adjunctive treatment, {{in combination with other}} antipsychotics, so that more refractory patients get dopamine blockade from the other antipsychotic, and dopamine depletion from reserpine. Doses for this kind of adjunctive goal can be kept low, resulting in better tolerability. Originally, doses of 0.5mg to 40mg daily were used to treat psychotic diseases.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has documented {{the widespread use}} of <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> by nursing staff with older persons, although less is known about the knowledge that nurses actually have about these drugs. The purpose of this exploratory, descriptive study was to survey a sample of UK gerontological nurses from different work settings on their knowledge of <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs.</b> Methods: An exploratory descriptive study design was utilised, whereby a sample of nursing staff was given a questionnaire developed to determine knowledge about <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> and their use with older persons. Questionnaires were distributed to 100 nursing staff, including registered general nurses, registered mental nurses, state enrolled nurses, nursing assistants and care assistants. Of the 100 questionnaires distributed, 62 were returned and 57 were completed substantially enough for data analysis. Results: Descriptive statistics including frequencies and means were calculated for demographic variables and the questionnaire responses. Results indicated that the use of <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> within the psychiatric hospital setting was substantial, with 43. 7 % of patients receiving <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs,</b> for an average length of time of 1. 8 years. Conclusions: Nursing staff participants from all three work settings revealed a number of significant knowledge gaps, particularly with regard to appropriate indications for <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> with older persons and the side-effects of <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs.</b> Summary: This paper adds new information regarding the use of <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> in the nursing care of older people...|$|R

25|$|Hallucinations {{can occur}} in parkinsonian syndromes {{for a variety of}} reasons. An overlap exists between PD and Lewy body dementia, so that where Lewy bodies are present in the visual cortex, {{hallucinations}} may result. Hallucinations can also be brought about by excessive dopaminergic stimulation. Most hallucinations are visual in nature, often formed as familiar people or animals, and are generally not threatening in nature. Some patients find them comforting; however, their caregivers often find this part of the disease most disturbing, and the occurrence of hallucinations is a major risk factor for hospitalisation. Treatment options consist of modifying the dosage of dopaminergic drugs taken each day, adding an <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drug</b> such as quetiapine, or offering caregivers a psychosocial intervention to help them cope with the hallucinations.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drug,</b> {{chlorpromazine}} (known {{under the}} trade name Largactil in Europe and Thorazine in the United States), was first synthesised in France in 1950. Pierre Deniker, a psychiatrist of the Saint-Anne Psychiatric Centre in Paris, {{is credited with}} first recognising the specificity of action of the drug in psychosis in 1952. Deniker travelled with a colleague to the United States and Canada promoting the drug at medical conferences in 1954. The first publication regarding its use in North America {{was made in the}} same year by the Canadian psychiatrist Heinz Lehmann, who was based in Montreal. Also in 1954 another antipsychotic, reserpine, was first used by an American psychiatrist based in New York, Nathan S. Kline. At a Paris-based colloquium on neuroleptics (antipsychotics) in 1955 a series of psychiatric studies were presented by, among others, Hans Hoff (Vienna), Dr.Ihsan Aksel (Istanbul), Felix Labarth (Basle), Linford Rees (London), Sarro (Barcelona), Manfred Bleuler (Zurich), Willi Mayer-Gross (Birmingham), Winford (Washington) and Denber (New York) attesting to the effective and concordant action of the new drugs in the treatment of psychosis.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{held that}} a person {{awaiting}} trial has a valid reason, protected under the due process clause, to refuse antipsychotic drugs, referencing Washington v. Harper (1990) and Bell v. Wolfish (1979). Therefore, once Riggins' requested termination of the medication, the State was obligated to establish both {{the need for the}} <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drug</b> and its medical appropriateness for Riggins' safety and that of others as the less restrictive alternative available. If the state had done this, due process would have been satisfied. The State {{might have been able to}} justify the treatment, if medically appropriate, if it set forth that the adjudication of guilt or innocence could not be established by using less intrusive means. Since the trial court did not do this and allowed the drug's administration to continue without making any of the determinations stated above, it is very likely that this error violated Riggins' trial rights established by the Constitution. However, this is only speculative as there is no way to know what the outcome would have been if the proper course had been followed.|$|E
40|$|Perspective ” in your April 2007 (1) issue {{speaks of}} the {{importance}} of considering all aspects of obesity. However, one aspect overlooked in the article is weight gain associated with medical treatment. Many classes of drugs are associated with weight gain that leads to overweight or obesity; these include atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs,</b> lithium, some antidepressant drugs, some antiepileptic drugs, and some steroids. Other drugs are associated with fat redistribution (e. g., some drugs for HIV/AIDS). In addition to increasing weight, atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> increase risk for hyperglycemia (as noted in a blackbox label required by the Food and Drug Administration [FDA]), and they are associated with lipid dysregulation (2). Atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> induce excitation and hypomania or mania, adverse effects never reported for the older versions of typical <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> (3). Some atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> are also noncardiac QTc-interval–prolonging drugs and are associated with increased sudden cardiac death (4). Atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> are widely used offlabel. The FDA issued a Public Health Advisory warning of a 60 % to 70 % increased risk for mortality among elderly people with dementia being treated with atypical antipsychotic medications (5). From 1993 through 2002, prescriptions for atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> for American children increased 500 % (all off-label); 85 % of those prescriptions were for nonpsychotic conditions (6). The public health implications of wide off-label use of this class of drugs merits more study...|$|R
40|$|Priapism {{is a rare}} but {{important}} side effect of <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> which may evolve into a urological emergency. Most <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs</b> are alpha- 1 adrenergic antagonists, which {{is thought to be}} the principal mechanism involved in antipsychotic-induced priapism. Other aetiologies exist, however. A case is presented with multiple episodes of priapism during the use of several different <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs.</b> The case is representative of many patients treated with <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs,</b> as there were hyperprolactinemia, and illicit drug use, which are known causes of priapism. Moreover, the patient used combinations of <b>antipsychotic</b> <b>drugs.</b> The case thus illustrates the etiological complexity which could delay a diagnosis of antipsychotic-induced priapism, and the problem of establishing a link between priapism and one particular ingredient of a drug combination. The case presents how a treatment regimen was finally established balancing antipsychotic efficacy to acceptable side effects and offers guidance to physicians regarding how antipsychotic-induced priapism may be resolved...|$|R
