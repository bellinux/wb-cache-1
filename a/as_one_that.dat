5|$|Hindu scriptures, {{dated to}} between 5th century and 1st century BC, while {{discussing}} human diet, initially suggest kosher meat may be eaten, evolving {{it with the}} suggestion that only meat obtained through ritual sacrifice can be eaten, then that one should eat no meat because it hurts animals, with verses describing the noble life <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> lives on flowers, roots and fruits alone.|$|E
5|$|The team {{is called}} {{to the home of}} a man whose heart was removed through a {{makeshift}} operation. They learn that not only did someone call for emergency help shortly after the heart's removal, but the man was found alive by the emergency response team well after his heart was removed, though he eventually died by the time Fringe arrived. Walter (John Noble) and Peter recognize scars on the blood vessels leading to the heart, identifying the victim <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> received a heart transplant. During the autopsy at the lab, Walter concludes that a serum was used to prolong the victim's life well after the heart's removal, a chemical based on his own past research into life restoration.|$|E
5|$|Ex situ {{research}} (or off-site research) is also {{popular among}} researchers looking {{to answer questions}} {{that are difficult to}} test in the field. For example, efforts to sequence the genome of the gray mouse lemur will help researchers understand which genetic traits set primates apart from other mammals and will ultimately help understand what genomic traits set humans apart from other primates. One of the foremost lemur research facilities is the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in Durham, North Carolina. It maintains the largest captive lemur population outside of Madagascar, which it maintains for non-invasive research and captive breeding. Many important research projects have been carried out there, including studies of lemur vocalizations, basic locomotor research, the kinematics of bipedalism, the effects of social complexity transitive reasoning, and cognition studies involving a lemur's ability to organize and retrieve sequences from memory. Other facilities, such as the Lemur Conservation Foundation, located near Myakka City, Florida, have also hosted research projects, such <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> looked at lemurs' ability to preferentially select tools based on functional qualities.|$|E

5|$|Most puzzles {{are located}} on {{recognizable}} eye-level panels scattered around the island, often connected with power cables that light up once a puzzle is solved and guiding the player to the next puzzle. Some puzzles incorporate the game's architecture, such <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> requires the player to view background elements through a semi-transparent puzzle panel to determine the solution. There are also non-obvious puzzles built into the environment itself, requiring the player to find the correct vantage point to complete the puzzle. At any time, the player can engage the maze-drawing mode, which {{is marked by a}} white border on screen. While in this mode, the player's avatar is prevented from moving and instead allows the player to use their controls to trace the path through a presented maze. The mode ends once the player solves the puzzle or cancels the mode. Normally, this mode is activated in front of a panel, moving the player's view directly to the panel to solve it, {{but it can also be}} activated at any other time to engage those puzzles that are based on vantage points. Nearly all puzzles provide immediate feedback if they have been solved correctly or not through sound effects or visual indication.|$|E
5|$|Obama's {{inaugural address}} {{received}} mixed reviews, with some describing {{the tone of}} the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the speech as low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about {{the tone of the}} speech, saying that the speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the speech <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to varying}} ideologies, feminists {{were not always}} {{supportive}} of each other's efforts. Harriet Martineau and others dismissed Wollstonecraft's contributions as dangerous, and deplored Norton's candidness, but seized on the abolitionist campaign that Martineau had witnessed in the United States <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> should logically be applied to women.

25|$|Agent-neutral consequentialism {{ignores the}} {{specific}} value {{a state of}} affairs has for any particular agent. Thus, in an agent-neutral theory, an actor's personal goals do not count any more than anyone else's goals in evaluating what action the actor should take. Agent-focused consequentialism, on the other hand, focuses on the particular needs of the moral agent. Thus, in an agent-focused account, such <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> Peter Railton outlines, the agent might be concerned with the general welfare, but the agent {{is more concerned with}} the immediate welfare of herself and her friends and family.|$|E
25|$|Julian’s {{business}} ventures became {{the source of}} considerable wealth {{for himself and his}} family. As a result of financial prosperity of these ventures, Julian soon became a prominent and wealthy businessman, where he was able to make investments during bad economic cycles due to Mexico's frequent economic downturns. Julián was known for his business savvy, strong work ethic, and commitment to traditional Lebanese moral values. Having a deep understanding of business that was considered ahead of his time, one of Julián's many pioneering business concepts was an efficient business <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> sold large volumes at smaller margins, and with payment facilities, factors that are prevalent in many large discount stores today.|$|E
25|$|The Grotto {{took shape}} {{during the first}} “Golden Age of Fraternalism.” During this time there were {{hundreds}} of fraternal groups in the United States and {{a significant portion of the}} country’s population belonged to at least one of them. The men knew that they’d have to have a ritual and ceremony unlike any other, as well <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> encompassed the ideals and values the group believed in. With this in mind, Brother George Beal and Brother Adon Smith worked together to create a ritual for the order. This work was brought before a ritual committee which was pleased with the result. This version of the ceremony would be used to initiate Riddell and Tompkins as the first new members.|$|E

25|$|Thus Galen {{summarised}} and synthesised {{the work}} of his predecessors, and it is in Galen's words (Galenism) that Greek medicine was handed down to subsequent generations, such that Galenism became the means by which Greek medicine was known to the world. Often, this was in the form of restating and reinterpreting, such as in Magnus of Nisibis' 4th-century work on urine, which was in turn translated into Arabic. Yet the full importance of his contributions was not appreciated till long after his death. Galen's rhetoric and prolificity were so powerful as to convey the impression that there was little left to learn. The term Galenism has subsequently taken on both a positive and pejorative meaning <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> transformed medicine in late antiquity yet so dominated subsequent thinking as to stifle further progress.|$|E
25|$|Some modern {{theories}} of political economy consider a large middle class to be a beneficial, stabilizing influence on society, {{because it has}} neither the possibly explosive revolutionary tendencies of the lower class, nor the absolutist tendencies of an entrenched upper class. Most sociological definitions of middle class follow Max Weber. Here {{the middle class is}} defined as consisting of professionals or business owners who share a culture of domesticity and sub-urbanity and a level of relative security against social crisis, in the form of socially desired skill or wealth. Thus the theory on the middle class by Max Weber can be cited <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> supports the notion of the middle class being composed of a quasi-elite of professionals and managers, who are largely immune to economic downturns and trends such as out-sourcing which affect the statistical middle class.|$|E

She also thanked the organizers and hoped peace will spread all over the Arab world. The charity event was held under the patronage of H.H.
