5|$|Subsequent {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} two important skills in joint attention are following eye gaze and identifying intention. The <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> share gaze with another individual {{is an important}} skill in establishing reference. The <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> identify intention is important in a child's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> learn language and direct the attention of others. Joint attention is important for many aspects of language development including comprehension, production and word learning. Episodes of joint attention provide children with information about their environment, allowing individuals to establish reference from spoken language and learn words. Socio-emotional development and the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> take part in normal relationships are also influenced by joint attention abilities. The <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> establish joint attention may be negatively affected by deafness, blindness, and developmental disorders such as autism.|$|E
5|$|The {{executive}} {{function of the}} brain is the set of cognitive processes that allow the cognitive control of behavior: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions include the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> filter information and tune out irrelevant stimuli with attentional control and cognitive inhibition, the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> process and manipulate information held in working memory, the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> think about multiple concepts simultaneously and switch tasks with cognitive flexibility, the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> inhibit impulses and prepotent responses with inhibitory control, and the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> determine the relevance of information or appropriateness of an action. Higher order {{executive function}}s, require multiple cognitive processes including planning, reasoning, and problem solving.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} traditions and stories {{associated with the}} flag, most of which deal with its magical properties and mysterious origins. The flag {{is said to have}} originated as: a gift from the fairies to an infant chieftain; a gift to a chief from a departing fairy-lover; a reward for defeating an evil spirit. The various powers attributed to the Fairy Flag include: the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> multiply a clan's military forces; the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> save the lives of certain clanfolk; the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> cure a plague on cattle; the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> increase the chances of fertility; and the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> bring herring into the loch at Dunvegan.

5|$|A strain is a {{subgroup}} {{within the}} species that has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other strains. These differences are often detectable only at the molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium. For example, a strain may gain pathogenic capacity, the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> use a unique carbon source, the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> take upon a particular ecological niche, or the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> resist antimicrobial agents. Different strains of E. coli are often host-specific, {{making it possible to}} determine the source of fecal contamination in environmental samples. For example, knowing which E. coli strains are present in a water sample allows researchers to make assumptions about whether the contamination originated from a human, another mammal, or a bird.|$|E

In a collective prayer to the Mahavidyas in the Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana, the devotee prays to emulate Chhinnamasta in her generosity to others. Other goals common to worship of all Mahavidyas are: poetic speech, well-being, control of one's foes, removal of obstacles, <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> sway kings, <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> attract others, conquest over other kings, and, finally, moksha (salvation).|$|E

5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} {{has been}} more broadly described as the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> adjust one’s thinking from old situations to new situations {{as well as the}} <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> overcome responses or thinking that have become habitual and adapt to new situations. As such, if one is able to overcome previously held beliefs or habits (when it is required for new situations) then they would be considered cognitively flexible. Lastly, the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> simultaneously consider two aspects of an object, idea, or situation at one point in time refers to cognitive flexibility. According to this definition, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they can sort cards based on the color of the objects and type of objects on the card simultaneously. Similarly, cognitive flexibility has been defined as having the understanding and awareness of all possible options and alternatives simultaneously within any given situation.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} how different emotional abilities affect the emergence of task and relationship leaders in a group of 41 students. To conduct this investigation, leadership is envisioned as a dynamic network of leadership perceptions. The emergence of leadership and the role played by emotional abilities in this process are analyzed using Stochastic Actor Oriented Models (SAOMs). The results suggest that emotional abilities play complementary roles in emergent leadership. Whereas the <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> perceive and manage emotions facilitate the emergence of relationship leaders, the <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> use and understand them facilitate the emergence of task leaders. Highlights ► Emotional intelligence and the emergence of relationship and task leadership. ► Leadership envisioned as a dynamic network of leadership perceptions. ► Longitudinal network analysis (SAOM). ► <b>Abilities</b> <b>to</b> perceive and manage emotions facilitate the emergence of relationship leaders. ► <b>Abilities</b> <b>to</b> use and understand emotions facilitate the emergence of task leaders. ► Leaders need emotional intelligence...|$|R
40|$|Several {{bacterial}} isolates {{were characterized}} {{based on their}} <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> degrade specific polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and their 16 s rRNA gene sequences. The members of one group of bacteria consisting of Alcaligenes species, including the PCB-degrading bacterium Alcaligenes eutrophus H 850, had strong <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> degrade {{a broad range of}} PCBs but not the di-para-chlorine-substituted congeners. The members of another group, which included the PCB-degrading bacterium originally classified as Corynebacterium sp. strain MB 1, had strong <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> degrade di-para-chlorine-substituted PCBs. These bacteria were most likely different members of Rhodococcus species. Aerobic microbial degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is well documented and has been characterized at the genetic level for several bacterial isolates (6, 12, 16, 19).
