5|$|The {{shooting}} {{down of the}} plane served as the catalyst for the Rwandan genocide, which began within a few hours. <b>An</b> <b>interim</b> <b>government</b> took over, headed by de facto-leader Colonel Théoneste Bagosora, which began ordering the systematic killing of huge numbers of Tutsi, {{as well as some}} politically moderate Hutu, through well-planned attacks. Over the course of approximately 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 were killed.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the war had}} officially ended, a {{state of}} anarchy and {{lawlessness}} pervaded {{in the first days}} following the demise of Vitellius. Order was properly restored by Mucianus in early 70, who headed <b>an</b> <b>interim</b> <b>government</b> with Domitian as the representative of the Flavian family in the Senate. Upon receiving the tidings of his rival's defeat and death at Alexandria, the new Emperor at once forwarded supplies of urgently needed grain to Rome, along with an edict or a declaration of policy, in which he gave assurance of an entire reversal of the laws of Nero, especially those relating to treason. In early 70, Vespasian was still in Egypt however, continuing to consolidate support from the Egyptians before departing. By the end 70, he finally returned to Rome, and was properly installed as Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Babangida survived an {{abortive}} coup, then postponed a promised {{return to}} democracy to 1992. Free {{and fair elections}} were finally held on 12 June 1993, the first since the military coup of 1983, with a presidential victory for Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola of the Social Democratic Party, who gained some 58% of the votes, defeating Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention. However, Babangida annulled the elections, leading to massive civilian protests that effectively shut down the country for weeks. Babangida finally kept his promise to relinquish office to a civilian government, but not before appointing Ernest Shonekan head of <b>an</b> <b>interim</b> <b>government.</b> Babangida's regime has been considered the most corrupt, and responsible for creating a culture of corruption in Nigeria.|$|E

50|$|The November 2015 {{election}} {{is the first}} to be overseen by <b>an</b> <b>interim</b> election <b>government,</b> which must be formed in the event that the President calls an early vote if a government cannot be formed. With the June 2015 election being the only election after which politicians were unable to form a government, {{this is the first time}} the constitutional provision requiring <b>an</b> <b>interim</b> election <b>government</b> has been enacted. Serving Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu was tasked with forming the <b>interim</b> <b>government</b> on 25 August 2015, a day after Erdoğan announced the snap poll.|$|R
25|$|An {{agreement}} to form <b>a</b> unified <b>interim</b> <b>government</b> was signed on 17 December 2015. Under {{the terms of}} the agreement, a nine-member Presidency Council and <b>a</b> seventeen-member <b>interim</b> <b>Government</b> of National Accord would be formed, with a view to holding new elections within two years. The House of Representatives would continue to exist as a legislature and an advisory body, {{to be known as the}} State Council, will be formed with members nominated by the General National Congress (2014).|$|R
5|$|Both second-round {{candidates}} and the incumbent president were initially {{arrested by the}} junta. Members of the Military Council, which ran the country until an interim National Transitional Council was established on 15 April, {{said that one of}} the reasons for the coup was the incumbent civilian administration's call for Angolan help to reform the military. Following international condemnation and sanctions against leaders of the junta, an agreement was signed that led to the third place candidate in the election, Manuel Serifo Nhamadjo, being selected as interim president. The presidential election was aborted and postponed for at least two years into the future. <b>An</b> <b>interim</b> <b>government</b> is tasked with administering Guinea-Bissau in the meantime.|$|E
5|$|Diplomatic efforts {{between the}} Netherlands and the Republic {{continued}} throughout 1948 and 1949. Political pressures, {{both domestic and}} international, hindered Dutch attempts to decide upon objectives. Similarly, Republican leaders faced great difficulty in persuading their people to accept diplomatic concessions. By July 1948 negotiations were in deadlock and the Netherlands pushed unilaterally towards Van Mook’s federal Indonesia concept. The new federal states of South Sumatra and East Java were created, although neither had a viable support base. The Netherlands set up the Bijeenkomst voor Federaal Overleg (BFO) (or Federal Consultative Assembly), a body comprising {{the leadership of the}} federal states, and charged with the formation of a United States of Indonesia and <b>an</b> <b>interim</b> <b>government</b> by the end of 1948. The Dutch plans, however, had no place for the Republic unless it accepted a minor role already defined for it. Later plans included Java and Sumatra but dropped all mention of the Republic. The main sticking point in the negotiations was the balance of power between the Netherlands High Representative and the Republican forces.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Jinnah and Gandhi, who had by then been {{released}} from his palatial prison, met formally at the Muslim leader's home on Malabar Hill in Bombay. Two weeks of talks followed between them, which resulted in no agreement. Jinnah insisted on Pakistan being conceded prior to the British departure and to come into being immediately, while Gandhi proposed that plebiscites on partition occur sometime after a united India gained its independence. In early 1945, Liaquat and the Congress leader Bhulabhai Desai met, with Jinnah's approval, and agreed that after the war, the Congress and the League should form <b>an</b> <b>interim</b> <b>government</b> {{with the members of}} the Executive Council of the Viceroy to be nominated by the Congress and the League in equal numbers. When the Congress leadership were released from prison in June 1945, they repudiated the agreement and censured Desai for acting without proper authority.|$|E

5|$|On 7 April, Kagame {{warned the}} {{committee}} and UNAMIR that he would resume the civil war if the killing did not stop. The next day, the Rwandan government forces attacked the national parliament building from several directions, but the RPF troops stationed there successfully fought back; Kagame began an attack from the north on three fronts, seeking to link up quickly with the troops isolated in Kigali. <b>An</b> <b>interim</b> <b>government</b> was set up but Kagame {{refused to talk to}} it, believing that it was just a cover for Bagosora's rule. Over the next few days, the RPF advanced steadily south, capturing Gabiro and large areas of countryside to the north and east of Kigali. They avoided attacking Kigali or Byumba at this stage, but conducted manoeuvres designed to encircle the cities and cut off supply routes. The RPF allowed Tutsi refugees from Uganda to settle behind the front line in the RPF-controlled areas.|$|E
5|$|Pakistan, {{attempting}} {{to force the}} issue of Kashmir's accession, cut off supplies and transport links. The chaos in Punjab resulting from Partition had also severed transport links with India, meaning that Kashmir's only links with the two dominions was by air. Rumours about atrocities against the Muslim population of Poonch by the Maharajah's forces caused the outbreak of civil unrest. Shortly thereafter, Pathan tribesmen from the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan crossed the border and entered Kashmir. The invaders made rapid progress towards Srinagar. The Maharaja of Kashmir wrote to India, asking for military assistance. India required the signing of an Instrument of Accession and setting up <b>an</b> <b>interim</b> <b>government</b> headed by Sheikh Abdullah in return. The Maharaja complied, but Nehru declared {{that it would have}} to be confirmed by a plebiscite, although there was no legal requirement to seek such confirmation.|$|E
5|$|Voting {{was carried}} out between 23 and 28 May 1993 and FUNCINPEC secured 45.47% of all valid votes cast, which {{entitled}} them to take up 58 out of 120 seats in the constituent assembly FUNCINPEC obtained the most seats in Kampong Cham, Kandal and Phnom Penh. The CPP came in second place and secured 38.23% of valid votes, and were unhappy with {{the outcome of the}} elections. On 3 June 1993, CPP leaders Chea Sim and Hun Sen met with Sihanouk to propose that he should lead a new interim government, and also demanding power-sharing for the CPP with FUNCINPEC on a fifty-fifty basis. Sihanouk agreed to the CPP's proposal and announced the formation of <b>an</b> <b>interim</b> <b>government</b> that evening. Ranariddh and other FUNCINPEC leaders were not consulted over Sihanouk's proposal, and the announcement caught them by surprise. Ranariddh sent a fax to his father to disapprove of the CPP's proposal, and the United States expressed a similar stance. Sihanouk publicly rescinded his earlier announcement of the interim government's formation the following day.|$|E

5|$|Nkomo {{remained}} unchallenged at {{the head}} of ZAPU, but the ZANU leadership had become contested between its founding president, the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole, and Robert Mugabe, a former teacher from Mashonaland who had recently won an internal election in prison. When they were released in December 1974 under the détente terms, Mugabe went to Mozambique to consolidate his leadership of the guerrillas, while Sithole joined Muzorewa's delegation. It had been agreed that the talks would take place within Rhodesia, but the black nationalists refused to meet on ground they perceived as not neutral. The Rhodesians insisted on abiding by the accord and negotiating inside the country. To please both camps the conference was held on a train halfway across the Victoria Falls Bridge on the border between Rhodesia and Zambia; the delegations sat {{on opposite sides of the}} frontier. The conference, which took place on 26 August 1975 with Kaunda and Vorster as mediators, failed to produce a settlement; each side accused the other of being unreasonable. Smith afterwards held direct talks with Nkomo and ZAPU in Salisbury, but these also led nowhere; Nkomo proposed an immediate transition to <b>an</b> <b>interim</b> <b>government</b> headed by himself, which Smith rejected. Guerrilla incursions picked up strongly in the first months of 1976.|$|E
