5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, while sailing to Port Royal, Jamaica, Governor Weatherby Swann, his {{daughter}} Elizabeth, and Lieutenant James Norrington encounter a shipwreck and recover a boy, Will Turner. Elizabeth discovers a golden pirate medallion <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> keeping {{it in order}} to protect him. Elizabeth sees a ghost ship vanish into the fog.|$|E
5|$|The iconographical {{attributes}} of Shiva are the serpent <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> the adorning crescent moon, the holy river Ganga flowing from his matted hair, the third eye on his forehead, the trishula as his weapon and the damaru. He is usually worshipped in the aniconic form of Lingam. Shiva is a pan-Hindu deity, revered widely by Hindus, in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka.|$|E
5|$|Once he was {{sufficiently}} recovered Cragh undertook {{a pilgrimage to}} Hereford, accompanied by Lord and Lady Briouze, to thank Cantilupe for restoring his life. He walked barefoot on the three-day trip, wearing the rope he had been hanged with <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> The rope was left at Cantilupe's shrine, after which Cragh {{said that he would}} make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, although there is some doubt as to whether he subsequently even left Wales. Jussi Hanska has suggested that Cragh may have invented the pilgrimage story to escape from his companions.|$|E
60|$|Fred {{could not}} arise; but he flung both arms <b>around</b> <b>his</b> tormentor's <b>neck,</b> hugging him so close as {{to prevent the}} latter from using his hands.|$|R
6000|$|Myles flung <b>his</b> arm <b>around</b> <b>his</b> friend's <b>neck,</b> {{and kissed}} him upon the cheek. [...] "Thou shalt have thy will," [...] said he; [...] "but whether knight or squire, thou art ever mine own true friend." ...|$|R
60|$|Another awkward one was Jack Pumpkinhead, {{for walking}} would jar <b>his</b> head <b>around</b> on <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> {{and then he}} would be likely to go in the wrong direction. But the Frogman took Jack's arm and then he {{followed}} the path more easily.|$|R
5|$|The cap {{was pulled}} down, {{and while he}} was praying the trap was pulled. Death was not instantaneous. Louis Riel's pulse ceased four minutes after the trap-door fell and during that time the rope <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> slowly strangled and choked him to death. The body was to have been interred inside the gallows' enclosure, and the grave was commenced, but an order came from the Lieutenant-Governor to hand the body over to Sheriff Chapleau which was {{accordingly}} done that night.|$|E
5|$|At the gallows, Beauchamp {{assured the}} {{assembled}} clergy {{that he had}} a salvation experience on July 6. Too weak to stand, he was held upright by two men while the noose was tied <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> At Beauchamp's request, the Twenty-Second Regiment musicians played Bonaparte's Retreat from Moscow while 5,000 spectators watched his execution. It was the first legal hanging in Kentucky's history. Beauchamp's father requested the bodies of his son and daughter-in-law for burial. The two bodies were placed in an embrace in a single coffin, as they had requested. They were buried in Maple Grove Cemetery in Bloomfield, Kentucky. The couple's tombstone was engraved with a poem written by Anna Beauchamp.|$|E
5|$|Genghis Khan (also {{known as}} Chinggis Khan) lost his {{battle against the}} Merkit (one of the major tribal confederations (khanlig) of the Mongols) and escaped death by seeking {{protection}} in the sacred precincts of the Burkhan Khaldun mountains. An old woman saved him and a few others. As mark of great reverence, which in Mongolia is considered a highly sacred mountain of spiritual significance, and to the sun above, he offered his respects to {{the spirits of the}} mountain around him, sprayed milk into the air and sprinkled it on the earth. He removed his girdle strap, unwinding it from his outfit, and then put it <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> Symbolically by this act he surrendered his Mongolian man's pride and expressed his submission to the gods.|$|E

50|$|In the video, G-Unit flaunts Maybach Music Group's rapper Gunplay's MMG {{chain that}} was taken from him at a brawl {{backstage}} at the 2012 BET Hip Hop Awards. G-Unit's Kidd Kidd has the chain draped <b>around</b> <b>his</b> sons <b>neck</b> in the video.|$|R
60|$|He leaned forward. With long, capable fingers he {{fastened}} {{the necklace}} <b>around</b> <b>his</b> daughter's <b>neck.</b> It fell upon her bosom, sparkling, a little circular stream of fire {{against the background}} of her smooth, white skin. Ella could scarcely speak. Her fingers caressed the jewels.|$|R
5|$|A {{tattoo on}} his arm {{identifies}} Tom Nero, and the rope still <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown {{to have as much}} feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one {{of its kind in the}} first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate.|$|E
5|$|For another episode for {{the series}} filmed in New York City he {{was asked by the}} NYPD not to pre-announce the performance, as crowd control for some Angel {{performances}} had become a concern for the police. This trick saw Angel hanging his feet, while bound with two straitjackets and a noose <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> which were attached to metal weights. While he was successful in the trick, Angel tore his shoulder muscles and this required surgery in January 2014. This resulted in the temporary closing of the Believe stage show between January and April 2014, while he was recovering from the surgery and returning to performance shape. He did however host a new stage show featuring other magicians between February and March 2014 in lieu of performing in his own show. Clips from the show also became the most watched YouTube magic clips {{in the history of the}} site, with more than 15 million views.|$|E
5|$|Ms. Hartman and Jackie {{are taken}} by the Cybermen for conversion, but the Cyber Leader orders the Doctor held aside because he has {{valuable}} information about the Daleks. The Cyber Leader is destroyed by a strike team led by Jake Simmonds, who have travelled from their universe {{in pursuit of the}} Cybermen. Ms. Hartman is converted, but Jackie escapes into a stairwell. Jake uses a device <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> to take the Doctor to the parallel universe and their version of Torchwood. The Doctor meets with the alternate universe Pete Tyler, who tells him that after he left the Cybermen were sealed in their factories while humanity decided what to do with them. In the meantime, the Cybermen vanished and the breach began causing unprecedented global warming on the parallel Earth, which the Doctor theorises is the start of the process that will lead to both planets falling into the Void. Pete demands the Doctor seal the breach before his Earth is destroyed.|$|E
25|$|On 6 August, he {{received}} Germany's highest award for valor, the Pour le Mérite, {{which is also}} nicknamed the Blue Max. Dostler's famous commanding officer, the Red Baron himself, Manfred von Richthofen took his personal Pour le Mérite from <b>around</b> <b>his</b> own <b>neck</b> and placed it around Dostler's throat.|$|R
50|$|Wu Teh wears a medallion, {{given to}} him by his {{grandfather}} on his deathbed.

5|$|The band {{met at the}} Londonderry Hotel on Park Lane, {{overlooking}} the park, where they had booked a tenth-floor suite, and proceeded to the park in the armoured personnel carrier, together with their two official photographers, Michael Cooper and Spanish Tony Sanchez. They alighted from the carrier into a caravan-trailer behind the stage. Jagger, his face heavily made up and with a studded leather collar <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> was clad in a white dress. He had borrowed the dress, which had been made for Sammy Davis Jr. at the Mr. Fish boutique, and wore it to Prince Rupert Lowenstein's white ball, where he had shown it to Princess Margaret. Jagger was only to wear it for half-an-hour at the Hyde Park concert, after which he tore it off to reveal a violet T-shirt and white loon pants.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the nearby Lindow Man in 1984 generated renewed interest in bog bodies, and in 1987 what had become known as Worsley Man was re-examined. The inspection revealed a wound behind the right ear, fractures {{to the top of}} the skull, and a cut through the vertebra where he had been decapitated. The remains of a garotte were also found <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> all of which was suggestive of a ritual killing rather than an accidental death, perhaps related to the Celtic cult of the severed head. The condition of the tooth pulp suggested that Worsley Man was 20–30 years old at the time of his death, which radiocarbon dating of a fragment of preserved soft tissue indicated was during the late Iron Age, some time around 120AD, identifying him as a Romano-British Celt. Worsley Man is now in the care of the Manchester Museum.|$|E
5|$|Back at the caves, after {{informing the}} {{survivors}} why {{they went into}} the jungle and that Dr. Arzt (Daniel Roebuck) is dead, Jack decides that he is going after Kate and Locke. Upon reaching the Hatch, he finds no one there and rappels down the shaft on his own. While exploring, he comes across a painted mural, and a wall where the key hanging <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> is pulled by a strong magnetic force. Finally, after being surprised by a bright light and loud music, he enters what appears to be an underground geodesic dome with computer equipment, including an Apple II Plus computer with its prompt glowing and its shift key relabeled execute. As Jack is about to use it, Locke appears and tells Jack not to touch it. After Jack raises the gun and asks where Kate is, Locke is revealed to be at gunpoint. The gunman threatens that he will shoot Locke if Jack does not surrender. Jack refuses, instead taunting Locke about his destiny. Finally, the gunman steps out and Jack seems to recognize him. The gunman is Desmond.|$|E
50|$|The Torquati were {{descended from}} the Capitolini, and {{obtained}} their surname from Titus Manlius Imperiosus, who defeated a giant Gaul during a battle in 361 BC, and took his torque as a trophy, placing it <b>around</b> <b>his</b> own <b>neck.</b> The descendants of Torquatus remained prominent until the final decades of the Republic.|$|R
60|$|The Tiger went next. Dorothy sat {{upon his}} back and locked her arms <b>around</b> <b>his</b> striped <b>neck,</b> for he had no mane to cling to. He made the leap {{straight}} and true as an arrow from a bow, and ere Dorothy realized it {{she was out of}} danger and standing by Ozma's side.|$|R
50|$|Henry Wadsworth Longfellow {{attested to}} his macabre streak in an anecdote {{relating}} how at one {{dinner at the}} Webster home, the host amazed his guests by lowering the lights, fitting a noose <b>around</b> <b>his</b> own <b>neck,</b> and lolling <b>his</b> head forward, tongue protruding, over a bowl of blazing chemicals, to give a ghastly imitation of a man being hanged.|$|R
5|$|In the Mainwaring chapel is the canopied wall tomb of SirWilliam Mainwaring of Baddiley and Peover {{who died}} in 1399. His effigy is in alabaster, it is {{recumbent}} and dressed in plate armour as a knight. His head rests on a helm bearing an ass's head and <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> is a gold collar of esses. The rest of the monument is in red sandstone. At {{the east end of}} the south aisle is a marble tomb commemorating SirRichard Wilbraham (1578–1643), his son SirThomas Wilbraham (1601–1660) and their wives. It includes the recumbent effigies in marble of SirThomas and his wife, Elizabeth. At the east end of the south aisle is an ancient piscina which is in good condition. In the chancel is another piscina and a sedilia, both of which are damaged. The screen in the Dorfold chapel is dated 1685 while that dividing the chancel from the nave is from a later date. The communion rail is also dated 1685. The brass chandelier dates from the 18thcentury. Stained glass in the east window and in windows of the south aisle is by Kempe and is dated between 1885 and 1888. The reredos includes the Ten Commandments {{to the north of the}} altar and the Lord's Prayer and the Creed to the south. The carved oak pulpion a stone base and the oak eagle lectern date from the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of 1139, rumours were current that the family was going to defect to Stephen's rival for the throne, the Empress Matilda. These rumours {{appear to have been}} started by a group of nobles led by twin {{brothers}} Waleran de Beaumont, the Count of Meulan, and Robert de Beaumont, the Earl of Leicester, with Alan of Brittany. Whether Roger and his family really intended to switch their support to Matilda is unclear, but unlikely. In late June, a fight broke out between some of the retainers of Alan and men in the service of Roger's family. This fight was the excuse for the king moving against Roger's family. Both the elder and younger Roger were arrested, along with Alexander, but Nigel escaped. Matilda of Ramsbury, who held out in Devizes Castle against the king, was persuaded to surrender the castle to Stephen when the king threatened to hang the younger Roger if she did not yield. The younger Roger was restrained with chains and put on a high platform in view of the castle with a noose <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once there, {{they are}} {{introduced}} to and begin {{to stay at the}} guesthouse of Kodandaram, an avid hunter, the neighbor and friend of Diganth's grandfather. Kodandaram, now handicapped from a hunting accident and confined to a wheelchair, lives with his wife Padma, daughter-in-law Sowmya, and daughters Radha and Pavani. Sowmya is widowed and teaches the village children; Radha, a student of Ayurveda, practices it alongside looking over the family's farming land; and Pavani is a student doing her pre-university course. Ganesh, a foodie, is fascinated with learning of Kodandaram's hunting spoils and persuades him to join them in hunting the very wild boar that left his legs crippled two years ago. At the forest, Kodandaram accidentally shoots Diganth in the chest, but is saved by a gong he had worn <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> They embark on another and final venture to kill the boar. As the boar approaches a rifle-wielding and wheelchair-bound Kodandaram, he gets up on his feet as an impulse and refuses to shoot it, thankful for bringing him back to his feet again, and calls it an incarnation of varaha.|$|E
60|$|Cap'n Bill halted {{long enough}} to grab the man <b>around</b> <b>his</b> long <b>neck</b> {{with one hand and}} <b>around</b> <b>his</b> long leg with the other hand. Then he raised the Blueskin in the air and threw him far over the wall. A moment later they had unfastened the gate and fled into the open country, where they headed toward the low {{mountain}} whose outlines were plainly visible in the moonlight.|$|R
50|$|In {{his early}} years Raghunatha spent much time in study, {{becoming}} adept in Sanskrit grammar and rhetoric and well versed in the scriptures. When his formal studies were complete his father sent him to Puri, where he again met Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, spending eight months in his service and cooking for him on a regular basis. Pleased by his service Chaitanya Mahaprabhu offered Raghunatha a tulsi garland from <b>around</b> <b>his</b> own <b>neck.</b>|$|R

5|$|Tarrare crossed Prussian lines {{under cover}} of darkness, {{disguised}} as a German peasant. Unable to speak German, he soon {{attracted the attention of}} local residents, who alerted the Prussian authorities, and he was captured outside Landau. A strip search found nothing suspicious on his person, and despite being whipped by Prussian soldiers, he refused to betray his mission. Brought before the local Prussian commander, General Zoegli, he again refused to talk and was imprisoned. After 24 hours of captivity, Tarrare relented and explained the scheme to his captors. He was chained to a latrine, and eventually, 30 hours after being swallowed, the wooden box emerged. Zoegli was furious when the documents, which Tarrare had said contained vital intelligence, transpired only to be deBeauharnais's dummy message, and Tarrare was taken to a gallows and the noose placed <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> (Some sources state that Zoegli never retrieved the box, as Tarrare had {{the presence of mind to}} recover and eat the stool containing it before it could be seized by the Prussians.) At the last minute, Zoegli relented, and Tarrare was taken down from the scaffold, given a severe beating, and released near the French lines.|$|E
5|$|After {{participating}} in the planned rebellion, Edmund became less popular at court. He was still allowed to accompany the king's wife Philippa to her coronation in January 1330, but his appearances at court became less frequent. At this point he became involved in another plot against the court, when he was convinced by rumours that his brother was still alive. It later emerged that Roger Mortimer himself was responsible for leading Edmund into this belief, in a form of entrapment. The plot was revealed, and in the parliament of March 1330 Edmund was indicted and condemned to death as a traitor. Upon hearing that the verdict was death, the condemned earl pleaded with Edward III for his life, offering to walk from Winchester to London with a rope <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> {{as a sign of}} atonement. Edward III however knew that leniency was not an option for the aforementioned entrapment utilized by Mortimer could extend to him and potentially be subversive to his own kingship if his father, Edward II truly was alive. Thus Edward III sanctioned the killing of his uncle. It was almost impossible to find anyone willing to perform the execution of a man of royal blood, until a convicted murderer eventually beheaded Edmund in exchange for a pardon. Edmund's body was initially buried in a Franciscan church in Winchester, but it was removed to Westminster Abbey in 1331.|$|E
5|$|Hill faced further {{problems}} as he {{planned for the}} operation. The American pilots of the Dakota transport aircraft that would transport the battalion were inexperienced and had never conducted a parachute drop before, {{and there was no}} time for any training or exercises. There were also no photos of the airfield or the surrounding areas, and only a single, smallscale map available for navigation. To ensure that the aircraft found the dropzone and delivered the battalion accurately, Hill sat in the cockpit of the leading Dakota and assisted the pilot. The Dakotas were escorted by four American P-38 Lightning fighters, which engaged and drove off two roving German fighters, but as the Dakotas approached the Tunisian border they encountered thick clouds and were forced to turn back, landing at Maison Blanche at 11:00. It was decided that the battalion would conduct the operation the next day, which allowed the paratroopers to rest for a night. 1st Parachute Battalion took off on the morning of 16 November, and enjoyed excellent weather that allowed the transport aircraft to drop the battalion accurately around the airfield at Souk elArba. Most of the paratroopers landed successfully, but one man was killed when his rigging line twisted <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> middrop, throttling him; one officer broke his leg on landing, and four men were wounded when a Sten gun was accidentally fired. The battalion's secondincommand, Major Alastair Pearson, remained at the airfield with a small detachment that collected the airborne equipment and supervised the burial of the casualty.|$|E
60|$|The Buli {{nodded to}} one of his big mountaineers, who stepped forward, {{swinging}} a club. Narau bolted into the nearest house, seeking to hide among the woman and mats; but John Starhurst sprang in under the club and threw <b>his</b> arms <b>around</b> <b>his</b> executioner's <b>neck.</b> From this point of vantage he proceeded to argue. He was arguing for his life, and he knew it; but he was neither excited nor afraid.|$|R
