5|$|After his much publicized {{problems}} on the base paths the previous season, Kemp arrived <b>at</b> <b>spring</b> training early to work with new Dodger coach Davey Lopes on his base running. Kemp announced his intention to steal 40 bases this season and Lopes hoped they would be high percentage steals. At {{the end of the}} season, Kemp had the 40 steals and was only caught 11 times, a significant improvement in percentage from the previous year, and his work with Lopes was credited for much of the improvement.|$|E
5|$|Enormous crowds {{could be}} {{accommodated}} <b>at</b> <b>Spring</b> Gardens, Vauxhall. In 1749 a rehearsal of Handel's Music for the Royal Fireworks attracted {{an audience of}} 12,000, and in 1786 a fancy-dress jubilee to celebrate the proprietor's long ownership was thronged with 61,000 revellers. Many {{of the best known}} musicians and singers of the day performed at the Gardens, for example Sophia Baddeley. In 1732, their fashionable status was confirmed by a fancy dress ball attended by Frederick, Prince of Wales. At that time access from the West End was by water, but the opening of Westminster Bridge in the 1740s made access easier though less charming.|$|E

5|$|Portland Road {{begins at}} a {{crossroads}} where the A215 crosses the A213 on South Norwood High Street and South Norwood Hill becomes Portland Road. The road then travels down a hill with many shops (mainly takeaways, newsagents).

From June 2010, the road will be the site of a station on the new London Overground network.|$|E
5|$|The park {{is built}} on the disused {{southern}} viaduct section of a New York Central Railroad line called the West Side Line. Originating in the Lower West Side of Manhattan, the park runs from Gansevoort Street – three blocks below 14th Street – in the Meatpacking District, through Chelsea, to {{the northern edge of}} the West Side Yard on 34th Street near the Javits Center. Formerly, the West Side Line went as far south as a railroad terminal <b>at</b> <b>Spring</b> Street, just north of Canal Street. However, most of the southern section was demolished in 1960, with another small portion being demolished in 1991.|$|E

His tenacity came to fruition when, on April 21, 2007, Hamels pitched his first major league complete game, allowing one run on five hits and two walks while setting a career high with 15 strikeouts. Just three days before, the Phillies moved their opening day starter Brett Myers to the bullpen to be the closer, making Hamels the team's number one starter. On May 16, he carried a perfect game into the seventh inning, but then walked leadoff hitter Rickie Weeks and surrendered a home run to the next batter, J. J. Hardy.|$|E
5|$|Mobile has {{a number}} of {{historic}} structures in the city, including numerous churches and private homes. Some of Mobile's historic churches include Christ Church Cathedral, the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception, Emanuel AME Church, Government Street Presbyterian Church, St. Louis Street Missionary Baptist Church, State Street AME Zion Church, Stone Street Baptist Church, Trinity Episcopal Church, St. Francis Street Methodist Church, Saint Joseph's Roman Catholic Church, Saint Francis Xavier Catholic Church, Saint Matthew's Catholic Church, Saint Paul's Episcopal Chapel, and Saint Vincent de Paul. The Sodality Chapel and St. Joseph's Chapel <b>at</b> <b>Spring</b> Hill College are two historic churches on that campus. Two historic Roman Catholic convents survive, the Convent and Academy of the Visitation and the Convent of Mercy.|$|E
5|$|NY309 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY29A in downtown Gloversville. The route heads northward as Bleecker Street, passing large commercial buildings as it heads north through the city. <b>At</b> <b>Spring</b> Street—two blocks north of NY29A—the surroundings become more residential as the commercial structures {{are replaced by}} homes. The route continues on, crossing Cayadutta Creek between 8th Avenue and McLaren Street before leaving Bleecker Street at 11th Avenue to follow an unnamed western extension of 11th Avenue. At this point, the amount of development along NY309 drops substantially as it parallels Cayadutta Creek and heads northwestward {{out of the city}} limits. At this point, maintenance of the route shifts from the city of Gloversville to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT).|$|E

40|$|Electrical {{and ground}} {{magnetic}} surveys <b>at</b> Saratoga <b>Springs</b> and Tecopa hot springs {{in the vicinity}} of Death Valley reveal intersecting faults that appear to control the spring locations. Faults striking east-west and north-south intersect <b>at</b> Saratoga <b>Springs.</b> High electrical conductivity along imaged faults <b>at</b> Saratoga <b>Springs</b> implies shallow groundwater channels between 5 and 20 m deep. Regions of high conductivity correlate with water saturated zones or clays. Gradients in magnetic and conductivity data at Saratoga are interpreted as faults. Similarly northwest- and northeast-trending faults are inferred to intersect <b>at</b> Isolated <b>Spring</b> in Tecopa Valley. Our data suggest groundwater flow along deep structures allows water to be heated and could account for the water temperature of about 410 C <b>at</b> the <b>springs</b> <b>at</b> Bath in Tecopa Valley. However, we hypothesis that cold water from the Amargosa River percolates downward and mixes with hot water rising at the fault intersections. The river water accounts for the lower water temperatures at Saratoga and <b>at</b> the Isolated <b>Spring</b> as compared to the <b>Spring</b> <b>at</b> Bath in Tecopa Valley...|$|R

5|$|The High Line viaduct, then {{a portion}} of the New York Central Railroad's West Side Line, opened to trains in 1934. It {{originally}} ran from 34th Street to St. John's Park Terminal <b>at</b> <b>Spring</b> Street, and was designed to go through the center of blocks rather than over the avenue. It connected directly to factories and warehouses, allowing trains to load and unload their cargo inside buildings. Milk, meat, produce, and raw and manufactured goods could be transported and unloaded without disturbing traffic on the streets. This also reduced the load for the Bell Laboratories Building (which has housed the Westbeth Artists Community since 1970), {{as well as for the}} former Nabisco plant in the Chelsea Market building, which were served from protected sidings within the structures.|$|E
5|$|South of Athens, M-66 turns northward and M-60 {{continues}} around Union City {{and into}} southern Calhoun County. The road runs through Burlington on Leroy Street. At Marshall Street. M-60 meets {{the southern end}} of M-311 which runs north to the Battle Creek area. M-60 continues east through farm fields to Tekonsha where it meets Interstate 69 (I-69) northwest of town. Continuing to Homer, the highway runs along Lehigh Street in town; M-99 merges into M-60 after the intersection with Hillsdale Street. East of town, the highway widens into a four-lane divided highway; M-99 turns north along this short section of roadway and M-60 reverts to a two-lane highway again. The trunkline crosses the Kalamazoo River at Concord before it crosses into Jackson County. <b>At</b> <b>Spring</b> Arbor, M-60 passes the campus of Spring Arbor University. Outside of Jackson, the highway widens out to a full freeway bypass around {{the west side of the}} city. This bypass has one interchange with Michigan Avenue near Jackson County Airport. North of this interchange, the highway picks up the Business Loop I-94 and crosses the Norfolk Southern Railway line in the area. The freeway ends at a trumpet interchange with I-94 northwest of Jackson.|$|E
