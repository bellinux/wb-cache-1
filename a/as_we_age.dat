25|$|Another {{theory that}} is being {{examined}} to explain age related declines in working memory {{is that there is}} a limit in attentional resources seen <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>age.</b> This means that older individuals are less capable of dividing their attention between two tasks, and thus tasks with higher attentional demands are more difficult to complete due to a reduction in mental energy. Tasks that are simple and more automatic, however, see fewer declines <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>age.</b> Working memory tasks often involve divided attention, thus they are more likely to strain the limited resources of aging individuals.|$|E
25|$|Speed of {{processing}} is another theory {{that has been}} raised to explain working memory deficits. As a result of various studies he has completed examining this topic, Salthouse argues that <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>age</b> our speed {{of processing}} information decreases significantly. It is this decrease in processing speed that is then responsible for our inability to use working memory efficiently <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>age.</b> The younger persons brain is able to obtain and process information at a quicker rate which allows for subsequent integration and manipulation needed to complete the cognitive task at hand. As this processing slows, cognitive tasks that rely on quick processing speed then become more difficult.|$|E

Sighted participants outperformed the visually impaired regardless of testing modality. This suggests that vision tends to shape the general supramodal mechanisms of memory.|$|E

25|$|Some theorists {{argue that}} the {{capacity}} of working memory decreases <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>age,</b> and {{we are able to}} hold less information. In this theory, declines in working memory are described as the result of limiting the amount of information an individual can simultaneously keep active, so that a higher degree of integration and manipulation of information is not possible because the products of earlier memory processing are forgotten before the subsequent products.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea that}} free {{radicals}} are toxic agents was first proposed by Rebeca Gerschman and colleagues. In 1956, Denham Harman proposed the free-radical theory {{of aging and}} even demonstrated that free radical reactions contribute to the degradation of biological systems. Oxidative damage of many types accumulate with age, such as oxidative stress that oxygen-free radicals, because the free radical theory of aging argues that aging results from the damage generated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are small, highly reactive, oxygen-containing molecules that can damage a complex of cellular components such as fat, proteins, or from DNA, they are naturally generated in small amounts during the body's metabolic reactions. These conditions become more common <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>age,</b> including diseases related to aging, such as dementia, cancer and heart disease.|$|E

30|$|Compulsory {{schooling}} regulation, which co-exists {{with minimum}} age regulation in many countries, presents both an econometric and interpretive {{problem in our}} results. When both regulations relax at the same time, {{we will not be}} able to attribute the changes in child time allocation to one particular regulation. On the other hand, if compulsory schooling law relaxes at a younger age than the minimum age of employment, then it creates a distortion in the age profile of child time allocation. This is problematic <b>as</b> <b>we</b> use <b>age</b> trends in child time allocation to estimate the counterfactual allocation at the minimum <b>age</b> of employment. <b>We</b> find evidence consistent with binding compulsory schooling regulations in one country, Burundi, where the law may interfere with our ability to infer whether minimum age regulations bind.|$|R
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>age,</b> deficits {{are seen}} {{in the ability to}} integrate, manipulate, and reorganize the {{contents}} of working memory in order to complete higher level cognitive tasks such as problem solving, decision making, goal setting, and planning. More research must be completed in order to determine what the exact cause of these age-related deficits in working memory are. It is likely that attention, processing speed, capacity reduction, and inhibitory control may all play a role in these age-related deficits. The brain regions that are active during working memory tasks are also being evaluated, and research has shown that different parts of the brain are activated during working memory in younger adults as compared to older adults. This suggests that younger and older adults are performing these tasks differently.|$|E
25|$|The {{hip joint}} {{is unique in}} that it {{experiences}} combined mechanical loads. An axial load along the shaft of the femur results in compressive stress. Bending load at {{the neck of the}} femur causes tensile stress along {{the upper part of the}} neck and compressive stress along the lower part of the neck. While osteoarthritis and osteoporosis are associated with bone fracture <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>age,</b> these diseases are not the cause of the fracture alone. Low energy falls from standing are responsible for the majority of fractures in the elderly, but fall direction is also a key factor. Elderly tend to fall to the side as instead of forward, and the lateral hip and strikes the ground first. During a sideways fall, the chances of hip fracture see a 15-fold and 12-fold increase in elderly males and females, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Using {{data from}} the Wisconsin Entrepreneurial Climate Study, we study the sources of firms' finance during the very early stages of their lives.
