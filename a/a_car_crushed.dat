25|$|Although several hurricanes have brushed Tallahassee {{with their}} outer rain and wind bands, {{in recent years}} only Hurricane Kate, in 1985, and Hurricane Hermine, in 2016, have struck Tallahassee directly. The Big Bend area of North Florida sees several tornadoes each year during the season, but they are {{generally}} weak, cause little structural damage, and rarely hit the city directly. The most recent tornado to hit Tallahassee occurred on April 19, 2015. The tornado was classified as an EF1, and created a path as wide as 350 yards for almost 5 miles near Maclay Gardens. Damage included numerous downed tree limbs and <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>crushed</b> by a falling tree. During extremely heavy rains, some low-lying parts of Tallahassee may flood, notably the Franklin Boulevard area adjacent to the downtown and the Killearn Lakes subdivision (which is not within the city limits proper) on the north side.|$|E

50|$|Beat the Crusher is a British {{game show}} that aired on Sky One from 21 September to 23 November 1998. It was hosted by Melinda Messenger and {{assisted}} by Freddie Starr. The show was {{noted for its}} bizarre end game, which featured two couples gambling their automobiles {{for the chance to}} win a new one.

5000|$|The film {{deals with}} {{creativity}} and commercialism. Quint {{attempts to get}} back at his boss by making a negative commercial reusing themes from earlier in the film, including Lute saying [...] "The number one product of all human endeavor is waste...waste." [...] The commercial, advertising a Super-8 camera, talks about capturing events while you still can before everything is destroyed and discarded. It ends with Quint operating <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>crusher</b> and destroying numerous cameras. The commercial is hailed as a masterpiece, and wins an award, but Quint hurls the award into the Thames.|$|R

50|$|Vehicle {{recycling}} is {{the dismantling of}} vehicles for spare parts. At {{the end of their}} useful life, vehicles have value as a source of spare parts and this has created a vehicle dismantling industry. The industry has various names for its business outlets including wrecking yard, auto dismantling yard, car spare parts supplier, and recently, auto or vehicle recycling. Vehicle recycling has always occurred to some degree but in recent years manufacturers have become involved in the process. <b>A</b> <b>car</b> <b>crusher</b> is often used {{to reduce the size of}} the scrapped vehicle for transportation to a steel mill.|$|R

50|$|Stock, the two {{trucks were}} quite {{different}} {{in some ways}} and the same in others. Neither could steer very well, but the Double Dare was easier {{to set up and}} worked a bit better.

5000|$|Grave Digger was {{originally}} conceived in 1982 by Dennis Anderson as a mud bogger. This first truck {{was a red}} 1952 Ford pickup truck. Later on a silver and blue 1951 Ford Panel Truck was his new mud truck that would become the first Grave Digger monster truck. The truck received its name when Anderson, amicably trash talking with his fellow racers, said the now famous line, [...] "I'll take this old junk and dig you a grave with it", {{a reference to the}} age of his old pickup in comparison to their relatively modern trucks. Anderson gained a reputation for an all-or-nothing driving style and quickly became popular at local events. At one show, a scheduled monster truck failed to show up and Anderson, who already had large tractor tires on the truck, offered to <b>crush</b> <b>cars</b> {{in the absence of the}} full-size monster. The promoter accepted and Grave Digger was an instant success as <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>crusher</b> and led Anderson to leave mud bogging and pursue monster trucks instead.|$|R
5000|$|In RoboCop 2, RoboCop's {{right arm}} {{contained}} a display that alerted personnel to his health status. RoboCop's hands also contain actuators {{strong enough to}} crush every bone in a human hand (about 400 foot pounds). His right hand also contains a spike (referred to by fans as a [...] "dataspike" [...] and by production as the [...] "terminal strip") {{which is used to}} retrieve or display data from any computer bank with a corresponding port. At {{the end of the first}} film, the jack is also used as a stabbing weapon against the antagonist Clarence Boddicker. RoboCop is extremely strong, able to lift the front of the average car over his head with one arm or resist the <b>crushing</b> effort of <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>crusher,</b> as seen in the TV series (episodes 5 and 21, respectively). He was designed to be able [...] "to penetrate virtually any building," [...] and breaks locks with ease.|$|R

After escaping an attempt on his life in <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>crusher</b> (his first <b>car,</b> <b>a</b> Porsche 911 Carrera 4S), Jack, in desperation, goes to his former girlfriend and his current business partner Sam Harper at a restaurant in Chinatown. She recommends a way out: a massive illegitimate street racing event named [...] "The Run", which is a 3000-mile (4828km) journey across the continental USA, starting in San Francisco and ending in New York City. Sam manages Jack's $250,000 entrance fee for the race and promises him a 10% cut of the $25 million jackpot, but he has to defeat 210 other racers to win. To complicate things, he is in debt to both the police and the criminal organization, and both {{want to make sure that}} he never finishes the race.|$|R

500|$|Richard Maibaum, who co-wrote the {{previous}} films, returned {{to adapt the}} seventh James Bond novel. Maibaum fixed the novel's heavily criticised plot hole, where Goldfinger actually attempts to empty Fort Knox. In the film, Bond notes it would take twelve days for Goldfinger to steal the gold, before the villain reveals he actually intends to irradiate it with the then topical concept of a Red Chinese atomic bomb. However, Harry Saltzman disliked the first draft, and brought in Paul Dehn to revise it. Hamilton said Dehn [...] "brought out the British side of things". Connery disliked his draft, so Maibaum returned. Dehn also suggested the pre-credit sequence to be an action scene with no relevance to the actual plot. Wolf Mankowitz, an un-credited screenwriter on Dr. No, suggested the scene where Oddjob puts his <b>car</b> into <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>crusher</b> to dispose of a dead body. Because {{of the quality of}} work of Maibaum and Dehn, the script and outline for Goldfinger became the blueprint for future Bond films.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} how design information, {{in our case}} UML specifications, {{can be used to}} evolve a software system and validate the consistency of such an evolution. This work complements our previous work on reflective architectures for software evolution describing the role played by meta-data in the evolution of software systems. The whole paper focuses on a case study; we show how the urban traffic control system (UTCS) or part of it must evolve when unscheduled road maintenance, <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>crush</b> or <b>a</b> traffic jam block normal vehicular flow in a specific road. The UTCS case study perfectly shows how requirements can dynamically change and how the design of the system should adapt to such changes. Both system consistency and adaptation are governed by rules based on meta-data representing the system design information. As we show by an example, such rules represent the core of our evolutionary approach driving the evolutionary and consistency checker meta-objects and interfacing the meta-level system (the evolutionary system) with the system that has to be adapted...|$|R
