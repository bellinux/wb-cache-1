5|$|According {{to transit}} {{advocate}} Steve Munro, the SSE {{will be built}} to use only automatic train control. This would preclude the operation of T1 subway cars on the extension <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be too expensive to convert T1 cars to ATC.|$|E

5|$|Ali Bhai visits Hyderabad and assassinates Narayana. He meets Pandu {{to discuss}} {{the murder of a}} {{minister}} by blowing up a balloon. Pandu rejects this <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> involve killing innocents. At the same time as they are arguing, Qadri arrests Ali Bhai and tortures him. Ali Bhai's henchmen retaliate by filming Qadri's daughter as she is enticed into sexual activity by the minister's son, and release it to the media. They also kidnap her, forcing the police to release Ali Bhai. At the same time, Pandu manages to catch the gangsters who pretended to rape Shruti and she reconciles with him.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} related genus Barosaurus, the very long neck of Diplodocus {{is the source}} of much {{controversy}} among scientists. A 1992 Columbia University study of diplodocid neck structure indicated that the longest necks would have required a 1.6-ton heart — a tenth of the animal's body weight. The study proposed that animals like these would have had rudimentary auxiliary 'hearts' in their necks, whose only purpose was to pump blood up to the next 'heart'. Some argue that the near-horizontal posture {{of the head and neck}} would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not be elevated.|$|E
5|$|At {{this early}} stage, the term punk {{applied to the}} scene in general, not {{necessarily}} a particular stylistic approach <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> later—the early New York punk bands represented a broad variety of influences. Among them, the Ramones, the Heartbreakers, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and the Dead Boys were establishing a distinct musical style. Even where they diverged most clearly, in lyrical approach—the Ramones' apparent guilelessness at one extreme, Hell's conscious craft at the other—there was an abrasive attitude in common. Their shared attributes of minimalism and speed, however, had not yet come to define punk rock.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1934, {{the price}} of silver in the United States was {{effectively}} set by the government <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> support that price through purchases and sales of the metal; in 1934 it was $.45 per troy ounce. In 1958, {{with the return of}} lend-lease bullion, the Treasury's stock of silver reached 2.1 billion troy ounces; it began to vend the metal at $.91 per ounce to the public, despite the warnings of the Conference of Western Governors that there was not enough silver to make these sales and maintain coinage operations.|$|E
5|$|Bryan's {{nomination}} caused defections and {{divisions in}} the Republican party; many farmers in the Midwest, even in McKinley's Ohio, found the inflation it was expected free silver would cause to be attractive, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{make it easier to}} repay debts. Polls in battleground midwestern states, and word from activists there, showed that Bryan had made deep inroads into Republican support. One survey in August showed that of the midwestern states, only Wisconsin was safe for the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|By 1970, {{scientists}} {{realized this}} pose was incorrect {{and could not}} have been maintained by a living animal, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have resulted in the dislocation or weakening of several joints, including the hips and the articulation between the head and the spinal column. The inaccurate AMNH mount inspired similar depictions in many films and paintings (such as Rudolph Zallinger's famous mural The Age of Reptiles in Yale University's Peabody Museum of Natural History) until the 1990s, when films such as Jurassic Park introduced a more accurate posture to the general public.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1920s {{the rise}} in motor traffic had put {{pressure}} on the ferry's capacity. A proposed bridge between Shooter's Hill and East Ham was rejected <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be too obvious a target for wartime bombings, and a third vessel was introduced instead. Because of the lack of a fixed crossing, the Thames became a psychological barrier for those living in the East End of London, who could only use a limited number of routes to cross the river, including the Woolwich Ferry. The lack of a suitable alternative route was instrumental in creating plans for what eventually became the Dartford Crossing further downstream.|$|E
5|$|Cho was {{dispatched}} by the Soviet {{authorities to}} liberated Korea when the Red Army entered in 1945. By that time, he had substantial experience with Soviet literature and literature administration. The Soviets hoped that Cho would shape the cultural {{institutions of the}} new state based on the Soviet model. For the Soviets, the move was successful and Cho did not only that but also significantly developed socialist realism <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> become {{the driving force of}} North Korean literature and arts.|$|E
5|$|Descartes {{argued that}} God's {{existence}} can be deduced from his nature, just as geometric ideas can be deduced {{from the nature}} of shapes—he used the deduction of the sizes of angles in a triangle as an example. He suggested {{that the concept of}} God is that of a supremely perfect being, holding all perfections. He seems to have assumed that existence is a predicate of a perfection. Thus, if the notion of God did not include existence, it would not be supremely perfect, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be lacking a perfection. Consequently, the notion of a supremely perfect God who does not exist, Descartes argues, is unintelligible. Therefore, according to his nature, God must exist.|$|E
