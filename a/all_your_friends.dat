500|$|Chris Collum {{wrote for}} AbsolutePunk that Tell <b>All</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Friends</b> [...] "grabs the listener’s {{attention}} from the start" [...] and the album expressed [...] "feelings that are completely genuine, not contrived, rehearsed or formulaic, without being over-the-top or sappy". Collum called Lazzara and Nolan's vocal delivery [...] "rapid-fire" [...] in a [...] "back-and-forth way, {{as if they were}} carrying on a dialogue, [...] allows you to really attach to and {{get a sense of the}} raw emotion behind the songs". In a retrospective review for Alternative Press, Brendan Manley wrote that the album [...] "is as close as it gets to a modern masterpiece, capturing not just a band at their apex, but an entire scene". According to Manley, Tell <b>All</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Friends</b> was [...] "the crossover breaking point, finally bringing what had been percolating for years in East Coast VFW Halls to the attention of the masses". Channing Freeman of Sputnikmusic wrote that the album features [...] "power chords and clean strums and palm muting and reverb". About whether this was negative, Freeman said, [...] "With songs this good, it shouldn't be ... It's all here, solid and undeniably catchy".

500|$|Drowned in Sound {{included}} the album {{on their list}} of top albums of 2002.

500|$|With Rhodes {{insisting that}} the band not perform live again until they were much tighter, the Clash rehearsed {{intensely}} over the following month. Strummer later described how seriously the band devoted itself to forging a distinct identity: [...] "We were almost Stalinist {{in the way that}} you had to shed <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends,</b> or everything that you'd known, or every way that you'd played before." [...] Strummer and Jones shared most of the writing duties—"Joe would give me the words and I would make a song out of them", Jones later said.

Guitarist John Nolan left the band, citing exhaustion from touring, and bassist Shaun Cooper followed shortly afterwards. According to vocalist Adam Lazzara, Nolan and Cooper were, [...] "having trouble because everything was happening so fast. Going from being home... to being gone all the time and having your whole life consumed and almost defined by the band that you’re in is a lot to handle." [...] The group briefly considered breaking up. Guitarist Eddie Reyes contacted his friend, Breaking Pangaea frontman Fred Mascherino, who auditioned for Nolan's spot; bassist Matt Rubano, who grew up with drummer Mark O'Connell, then joined the group. They joined {{just in time for the}} band's fall 2003 tour.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, JJ Koczan of The Aquarian Weekly {{wrote that}} Where You Want to Be might [...] "perhaps {{go down in}} pop culture history as the record that broke the emo scene commercially." [...] Six tracks from the album were {{included}} on the 2007 Notes from the Past compilation. In 2014, Alternative Press Brian Kraus wrote that it was [...] "the closest they've come to the elusive 'perfect album. Calling it [...] "catchy" [...] in comparison to Tell <b>All</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Friends,</b> the album [...] "matured the words past freshman year and flexed the rhythm guitar to a new level." [...] In 2016, Fuse.tv ranked Where You Want to Be its number-one Taking Back Sunday album. According to Jason Lipshutz, the album [...] "still smacks harder" [...] than the band's other releases due to [...] "a masterful sequencing, tighter hooks and most transcendent single ("A Decade Under The Influence")." ...|$|E

500|$|Where You Want to Be sound {{has been}} called pop punk. According to MTV, the album was [...] "driven by punchy, melodic {{hardcore}} riffs and yearning vocals" [...] {{similar to that of}} The Movielife and Lifetime, with the band [...] "expand its musical boundaries and tak some chances." [...] Like Tell <b>All</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Friends,</b> the album's song titles were gleaned primarily from TV. The title of [...] "Bonus Mosh Pt. II" [...] came from a friend of the band; the group was playing demos for the friend, and during one section of a song the friend exclaimed: [...] "Whoa, that's a bonus mosh part two, man, that's cool." [...] "A Decade Under the Influence" [...] is about a person's realization that they understand less about the world than they had thought.

500|$|According to AllMusic {{reviewer}} Kurt Morris, Tell <b>All</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Friends</b> {{is similar}} to the Movielife's This Time Next Year (2000); Taking Back Sunday's [...] "ability ... to sound so blatantly" [...] like the Movielife was [...] "almost their undoing". Morris wrote that the vocals strongly resembled those of the Canterbury Effect, and called Taking Back Sunday [...] "a bit more rockin than the Movielife: [...] "They have cultivated punk, hardcore, emo, and pop and hybridized it better." [...] However, Morris called the album [...] "nowhere near original or creative". Rolling Stones Gil Kaufman wrote that the album [...] "sidesteps many sad-sack emo pitfalls" [...] with [...] "pop-infused hardcore" [...] and [...] "enlightened, dramatic lyrics" [...] describing [...] "heartache that teeter between despondency and dark vengeance". Peter White of Drowned in Sound wrote that the album contained He added that the album featured [...] "Nihilistic, angry pop gems covered in monster riffs" [...] that [...] "screams to rival anything on an Obituary record".|$|E

The sessions ended up costing $10,000. The band arrived without a drum set, presuming that the studio would have one. Engineer Tim Gilles said, [...] "No major studio in America has their own [...] set. You've gotta be fucking kidding me". The group wanted to re-record [...] "Your Own Disaster" [...] from their demo, but was unable to due to time and money constraints.
