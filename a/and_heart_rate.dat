5|$|Adrenaline and {{noradrenaline}} are catecholamines, water-soluble {{compounds that}} have a structure made of a catechol group and an amine group. The adrenal glands are {{responsible for most of}} the adrenaline that circulates in the body, but only for a small amount of circulating noradrenaline. These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include an increase in blood pressure <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate.</b> The actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised by a quickening of breathing <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate,</b> an increase in blood pressure, and constriction of blood vessels {{in many parts of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion, {{when used}} for {{treating}} obesity {{over a period}} of 6 to 12 months, may result in weight loss of 2.7kg over placebo. This is not much different from the weight loss produced by several other medications, such as sibutramine or orlistat. It has been studied in combination with naltrexone. Concerns from bupropion include an increase in blood pressure <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate.</b> In September 2014, a combination (bupropion/naltrexone) was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of obesity.|$|E
5|$|Loss of {{function}} of the vagus nerve (X) {{will lead to a}} loss of parasympathetic innervation to {{a very large number of}} structures. Major effects of damage to the vagus nerve may include a rise in blood pressure <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate.</b> Isolated dysfunction of only the vagus nerve is rare, but can be diagnosed by a hoarse voice, due to dysfunction of one of its branches, the recurrent laryngeal nerve.|$|E

5|$|Blood {{pressure}} <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> {{are influenced}} by the vasomotor centre of the medulla, which causes arteries and veins to be somewhat constricted at rest. It does this by influencing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems via the vagus nerve. Information about blood pressure is generated by baroreceptors in aortic bodies in the aortic arch, and passed to the brain along the afferent fibres of the vagus nerve. Information about the pressure changes in the carotid sinus comes from carotid bodies located near the carotid artery and this is passed via a nerve joining with the glossopharyngeal nerve. This information travels up to the solitary nucleus in the medulla. Signals from here influence the vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery constriction accordingly.|$|E
5|$|Its effects, {{depending}} on dosage, include {{an increase in}} sodium excretion by the kidneys, an increase in urine output, an increase in heart rate, {{and an increase in}} blood pressure. At low doses it acts through the sympathetic nervous system to increase heart muscle contraction force <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate,</b> thereby increasing cardiac output and blood pressure. Higher doses also cause vasoconstriction that further increases blood pressure. Older literature also describes very low doses thought to improve kidney function without other consequences, but recent reviews have concluded that doses at such low levels are not effective and may sometimes be harmful. While some effects result from stimulation of dopamine receptors, the prominent cardiovascular effects result from dopamine acting at α1, β1, and β2 adrenergic receptors.|$|E
5|$|Water {{temperature}} {{affects the}} sea turtle's metabolic rate. Lethargy is induced at temperatures between 13 and 15°C (55 and 59°F). The loggerhead {{takes on a}} floating, cold-stunned posture when temperatures drop to around 10°C. However, younger loggerheads are more resistant to cold and do not become stunned until temperatures drop below 9°C. The loggerheads' migration helps to prevent instances of cold-stunning. Higher water temperatures cause an increase in metabolism <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate.</b> A loggerhead's body temperature increases in warmer waters more quickly than it decreases in colder water; their critical thermal maximum is currently unknown.|$|E

5|$|Solitary and slow-moving, the marbled {{electric}} ray may remain motionless for several days at a time. It is more active at night and spends {{much of the day}} buried in sediment with only the eyes and spiracles showing. Consistent with its sluggish nature, the marbled {{electric ray}} has a low blood oxygen carrying capacity <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> (10–15 beats/min), and consumes less oxygen than other sharks and rays of similar size. It is highly tolerant of being deprived of oxygen (hypoxia), allowing it to cope with deoxygenated bottom waters or being stranded in small pools by the falling tide. The ray stops breathing entirely when the oxygen partial pressure in the water drops below 10–15 Torr, and can survive such a state for at least five hours. It deals with extreme hypoxia by coupling anaerobic glycolysis to additional energy-producing pathways in its mitochondria, which serves to slow down the accumulation of potentially harmful lactate within its cells.|$|E

40|$|The use of fish {{models in}} {{biomedical}} research is increasing. Since behavioural and physiological consequences of surgical procedures may affect experimental results, these effects should be defined and, if possible, ameliorated. Thus, {{the use of}} post-surgical analgesia should be considered after invasive procedures also in fish, but presently, little information exists {{on the effects of}} analgesics in fish. This study assessed the effects of an opioid drug, buprenorphine (0. 05 mg/kg IM), on resting ventilation <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> during 7 days of postsurgical recovery in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) at 10 °C by non-invasively recording bioelectric potentials from the fish via electrodes in the water. Baseline ventilation <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> were considerably lower compared to previously reported values for rainbow trout at 10 °C, possibly due to the non-invasive recording technique. Buprenorphine significantly decreased both ventilation <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> further, <b>and</b> the effects were most pronounced at 4 - 7 days after anaesthesia, surgical procedures and administration of the drug. Somewhat surprisingly, the same effects of buprenorphine were seen in the two control groups that had not been subject to surgery. These results indicate that the reductions in ventilation <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> are not caused by an analgesic effect of the drug, but may instead reflect a general sedative effect acting on both behaviour as well as e. g. central control of ventilation in fishes. This resembles what has previously been demonstrated in mammals, although the duration of the drug effect is considerably longer in this ectothermic animal. Thus, before using buprenorphine for postoperative analgesic treatment in fish, these potentially adverse effects need further characterisation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} the relation between QT intervals and a wide range of rest <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> in men. These data provided the basis of a simple method for adjusting the QT interval for <b>heart</b> <b>rate.</b> Background. Earlier correction equations give conflicting results, especially at low <b>and</b> high <b>heart</b> <b>rates.</b> Methods. The QT intervals were measured in 324 electrocardiograms of healthy young men. The sample was weighted for low <b>and</b> high <b>heart</b> <b>rates.</b> A curve relating QT intervals <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> from 40 to 120 beats/min was constructed. The QT interval at 60 beats/min was used as the reference value, and an adjusting nomogram for different <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> was created. The reliabilities of the nomogram and three earlier QT correction equations were tested in the study group and in 396 middle-aged men. Results. The nomogram method presented (QTNc= QT + correcting number) adjusted the QT interval most accurately over the whole range of <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> on the basis of smallest meansquared residual values between measured and predicted QT intervals. The Fridericia formula (QTFc= QT/RR 1 / 3) gave the best correction at low, but failed at high, <b>heart</b> <b>rates.</b> The linear regression equation (QTLc= QT + 0. 154 [1 − RR], Framingham Study) was reliable at normal, but failed at low <b>and</b> high, <b>heart</b> <b>rates.</b> The Bazett formula (QTc= QT/RR 1 / 2) performed poorest at all <b>heart</b> <b>rates.</b> The relation between QT and RR intervals was determined by three linear regressions expressing the slopes 0. 116 for <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> 100 beats/min. Conclusions. The QT-RR relation over a wide range of <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> does not permit the use of one simple adjustment equation.
