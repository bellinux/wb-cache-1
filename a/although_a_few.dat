5|$|Enzymes {{are known}} to {{catalyze}} more than 5,000 biochemical reaction types. Most enzymes are proteins, <b>although</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> are catalytic RNA molecules. The latter are called ribozymes. Enzymes' specificity comes from their unique three-dimensional structures.|$|E
5|$|Mills made {{large-scale}} {{changes to}} the squad over the summer of 2006, <b>although</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months into 2006–07 more budget cuts were made and this limited his ability to add to a squad lacking in depth. When he left Alfreton they were 13th in the Conference North, and he was playing less frequently, making five appearances in 2006–07.|$|E

5|$|Most species live in forests, <b>although</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{are found}} in other habitats. Insects and other {{arthropods}} form {{the most important part}} of their diet, although small vertebrates are occasionally taken. Most species feed in the understory and midstory of the forest, <b>although</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> feed in the canopy and a few on the ground. Many join mixed-species feeding flocks, and a few species are core members. To various degrees, around eighteen species specialise in following columns of army ants to eat the small invertebrates flushed by the ants, and many others may feed in this way opportunistically.|$|E

5|$|Alexander Stepanov and Meng Lee {{presented}} the Standard Template Library to the C++ standards committee in March 1994. The library received preliminary approval, <b>although</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> issues were raised. In particular, Stepanov was requested {{to make the}} library containers independent of the underlying memory model, {{which led to the}} creation of allocators. Consequently, all of the STL container interfaces had to be rewritten to accept allocators.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hagiographies, or saints' biographies, {{about native}} British saints survive {{from the period}} of the mission, none {{describes}} native Christians as active missionaries amongst the Anglo-Saxons. Most of the information about the British church at this time is concerned with the western regions of the island of Great Britain and does not deal with the Gregorian missionaries. Other sources of information include Bede's chronologies, the set of laws issued by Æthelberht in Kent, and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which was compiled in the late 9th century.|$|E

5|$|Ctenophores form {{an animal}} phylum {{that is more}} complex than sponges, about as complex as cnidarians (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.), and less complex than bilaterians (which include almost all other animals). Unlike sponges, both ctenophores and cnidarians have: cells bound by inter-cell {{connections}} and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs. Ctenophores are distinguished from all other animals by having colloblasts, which are sticky and adhere to prey, <b>although</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> ctenophore species lack them.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane {{was bombed}} and sunk in a German air raid on Liverpool {{during the night}} of 7/8 May 1941. She {{was struck by a}} bomb that passed through the hull and detonated {{underneath}} her. The explosion blew a large hole in her bottom and flooded her engine room and oil tanks. The ship's structure was badly damaged enough that her stern began to sag downwards and Hurricane was moved to Bidston Dock lest she sink and block traffic in the harbour. No one was killed in the attack, <b>although</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> crewmen received minor injuries.|$|E
5|$|Lincolnshire has two school districts: Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103 and Adlai E. Stevenson High School District 125, <b>although</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{students}} {{living in}} the village also attend school in Aptakisic-Tripp Community Consolidated School District 102 in neighboring Buffalo Grove. District103, which feeds into District 125, is home to three schools: Laura B. Sprague Elementary School (K-2), Half Day Intermediate School (3–4), and Daniel Wright Junior High School (5–8); District125 comprises only Adlai E. Stevenson High School. Both are public school districts, funded by the government.|$|E

5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} can {{be divided}} into thermotropic, lyotropic and metallotropic phases. Thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals consist mostly of organic molecules, <b>although</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minerals are also known. Thermotropic LCs exhibit a phase transition into the liquid-crystal phase as temperature is changed. Lyotropic LCs exhibit phase transitions as a function of both temperature and concentration of the liquid-crystal molecules in a solvent (typically water). Metallotropic LCs are composed of both organic and inorganic molecules; their liquid-crystal transition depends not only on temperature and concentration, but also on the inorganic-organic composition ratio.|$|E
5|$|Mecopterans mostly inhabit moist environments <b>although</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{species are}} found in {{semi-desert}} habitats. Scorpionflies, family Panorpidae, generally live in broad-leaf woodlands with plentiful damp leaf litter. Snow scorpionflies, family Boreidae, appear in winter and are to be seen on snowfields and on moss; the larvae being able to jump like fleas. Hangingflies, family Bittacidae, occur in forests, grassland and caves with high moisture levels. They mostly breed among mosses, in leaf litter and other moist places, but their reproductive habits have been little studied, {{and at least one}} species, Nannochorista philpotti, has aquatic larvae.|$|E
5|$|Most reviews {{were very}} favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, <b>although</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{complained that the}} final {{chapters}} seemed rushed. The writing {{has been compared to}} that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors, Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter, and the Ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues.|$|E

5|$|Most {{species of}} malacostracans have {{distinct}} sexes (a {{phenomenon known as}} gonochorism), <b>although</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> species exhibit hermaphroditism. The female genital openings or gonopores are located on the sixth thoracic segment or its appendages, while the male gonopores are on the eighth segment or its appendages, or in {{a small number of}} species, on the seventh. The naupliar larval stages are often reduced and take place before hatching, but where they occur, a metamorphosis usually occurs between the larval and the adult forms. Primitive malacostracans have a free-swimming naupliar larval stage.|$|E
5|$|Species in {{this order}} have a small, {{inflexible}} disc and 6–20 long, thin arms, which they use for suspension feeding. They {{have a single}} series of marginal plates, a fused ring of disc plates, a reduced number of aboral plates, crossed pedicellariae, and several series of long spines on the arms. They live almost exclusively in deep-sea habitats, <b>although</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> live in shallow waters in the Antarctic. In some species, the tube feet have rounded tips and lack suckers.|$|E
5|$|The French did {{not pursue}} the Austrians {{immediately}} {{because they were}} exhausted from two straight days of vicious fighting. After recuperating, they chased the Austrians and caught up with them at Znaim in mid-July. Here Charles signed an armistice with Napoleon and agreed to end the fighting. Military conflict between France and Austria was effectively ended, <b>although</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more months of diplomatic wrangling were required to make the result official.|$|E
