5|$|The video {{begins with}} the sound of a ticking clock and Levine and Rihanna sitting {{opposite}} each other at a table, tapping their hands <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> one and other. As the songs audio begins to play, band members of Maroon 5 start to play their instruments as Rihanna sits and watches them. The table and band scenes are intercut with each other for the first verse and chorus. For the second verse, Levine and Rihanna appear to argue and try to ignore the other's advances. Rihanna lays suggestively on a bed while Levine sits on a chair with his head turned in the opposite direction for the bridge. For the final chorus, the pair appear to reconcile, ending with Levine finally giving in to his temptations and walk {{to the end of the}} table where Rihanna sits and he caresses her neck causing Rihanna to lean towards him seductively and the two nearly kiss as the video ends. The video was made available to download digitally via iTunes on May 12, 2008.|$|E
25|$|When a {{fire engine}} drove within range, Huberty {{repeatedly}} pierced the vehicle with bullets, {{but did not}} wound any occupants. Hearing a wounded teenager, 19-year-old Jose Pérez, moaning, Huberty fatally {{shot him in the}} head; the boy slumped dead in the booth. Pérez died alongside his friend and neighbor, 22-year-old Gloria González, and a young woman named Michelle Carncross. At one point, Aurora Peña, who had lain wounded beside her dead aunt, baby cousin and two friends, noted a lull in the firing. Opening her eyes, she saw Huberty nearby <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> her. He swore and threw a bag of french fries at her, then retrieved his shotgun and shot her in the arm, neck, and chest. She survived, although she would be hospitalized longer than any other survivor. Occasionally, Huberty blurted justifications before murdering his victims as he shot them.|$|E

500|$|The video {{features}} Carey readying for her wedding, {{and follows}} {{her to the}} altar, {{as well as her}} escape from the reception. [...] Many of the actors featured in Carey's [...] "It's Like That" [...] video were in that of [...] "We Belong Together", which was shot as a continuation from the [...] "It's Like That" [...] video. It begins with a scene of a large mansion, apparently owned by the older man who she is to marry. Carey is seen walking barefoot in a room, shedding a black sheer robe and laying down on a bed draped with white linens. Dressed in lingerie, Carey's face is shown close-up, as scenes of her tossing in the bed are shown. As the song begins, Carey is seen sitting in front of a large mirror, preparing for her wedding by putting on earrings and shoes, <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the ring on her finger. Additional scenes of Carey sitting on a small blue sofa, wearing a purple dress, and Carey staring at the camera during a shower moment are interspersed. The wedding is then shown, with Miller approaching the reception through a stairwell in the back. Small children as seen throwing flowers on the white carpet, followed by Roberts and Carey walking down the aisle.|$|E
500|$|The {{first draft}} of the script portrayed Leslie and Mark as {{slightly}} less likable characters. Originally, Mark asked Ron to green-light the park project not to help Leslie, but because he was attracted to Ann and wanted another excuse to keep seeing her. These elements of the script were changed after press tours and focus group screenings. The show's writers spent time researching local California politics and attended Los Angeles City Council meetings. Daniels and Schur wanted the pilot to establish that one of Leslie's duties {{was talking to the}} public on a regular basis, and they deliberately portrayed her public forum meetings as poorly attended except by a select group of angry residents. Schur said, [...] "I've been to some community meetings in my life, and it is often this feeling of utter sparseness. That nobody cares." [...] In writing the script, Schur wanted Mark and Leslie to have a long history together before the events of the episode, rather than having the two characters meet {{for the first time on}} screen, which he felt had already been done in many television shows. The first shot of the pilot was originally a scene with Ann standing over the pit <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> it with an annoyed expression, followed by a documentary interview with Ann and Andy. The opening scene was changed because Daniels and Schur decided they wanted the first scene of the series to be set in a park. As a result, the episode started with a cold open of Leslie interviewing children in a park, then using a broom to push a drunk man out of spiral slide. Daniels had such a specific vision for the scene, he drew an elaborate and detailed storyboard sketch of a drunk man stuck in a tubular slide.|$|E
500|$|The scene wherein Peppermint Butler teaches Finn and Jake {{to enter}} {{the land of the}} dead by {{crossing}} their eyes <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> a corner was inspired by a story that Moynihan's father told him when he was younger. According to the artist, his father told him that if you [...] "concentrate really hard enough", you would [...] "walk into another dimension". Moynihan recalled the story when he was storyboarding, and worked it into the episode. The climax featuring Death and Finn engaging in a musical competition was specifically written so as to not be [...] "corny". According to Ward, scenes featuring contests were often avoided because they were [...] "the easiest traps to fall into when you're writing an outline". For [...] "Death in Bloom", the writing staff realized that a contest would work towards the story's strengths. In original drafts of the episode, Finn and Jake were guided through the Land of the Dead by a mysterious rabbit. Sanchez continually felt that the rabbit was misplaced in the episode. When it came time to revise the story, the rabbit was inevitably cut because it was agreed by the writers and series staff that the character did not fit within the story. The rabbit's role was later partially replaced by an ominous talking skull that tries to get Jake to drink from the [...] "River of Forgetfulness". According to storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar, a rough draft for the original ending featured Princess Bubblegum becoming a man without the Princess Plant. Moynihan later noted that the writers were being a [...] "little reckless" [...] when it was pitched, and Ward joked that he had to step in and be [...] "quality control" [...] to prevent the idea from making it into the final episode.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} a girl (a young Underwood) {{studying}} at home. Her abusive father arrives and asks her if she needs help. She declines his offer and starts gathering her things to leave the room, however; as she stands up, he grabs her arm. She manages to pull away and leave. Underwood stated that this scene had no script. She and the actor acted it out the way they thought it might have happened. Underwood revealed that she left the filming location with bruises on her arm- [...] "I had finger marks on my arm when I left {{at the end of}} the day, so I was like, 'Wow.' ... It was intense. I wasn't just imagining it, it was really intense." [...] As the video continues, the girl is seen standing in the middle of a cemetery, walking around <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the clouds as a thunderstorm forms in the sky. She runs back to her house through an old, destroyed yellow-brick road, similar to the one of Wizard of Oz. She enters the house to see her father sleeping on the couch, holding a bottle of alcohol. She sits next to him, recalling the times he let his drunkenness and anger get out of hand. She tries to wake him up but fails. She realizes that he has passed out. She looks through the window and notices the thunderstorm getting worse, so she leaves her father and runs to the cellar alone to protect herself. She's seen lying in an old bed and crying, as she hears the tornado coming closer, with her father still passed out. The next day, there are no traces of the house, and she calmly walks away.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Kemp told Radio Times {{that he has}} {{no plans}} to return to EastEnders: [...] "I enjoy the fact that I've far more control over my destiny than I ever had when acting. I didn't even watch the soaps when I was in them because it's like a coal miner coming home <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the coal scuttle—I was never a great lover of {{watching}} myself act." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{also was}} [...] "one {{of the most}} {{effective}} chroniclers" [...] of the violence that erupted at the independence and partition of India and Pakistan, according to Somini Sengupta, who calls her photographs of the episode [...] "gut-wrenching, <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> them, you glimpse the photographer's undaunted desire to stare down horror." [...] She recorded streets littered with corpses, dead victims with open eyes, and refugees with vacant eyes. [...] "Bourke-White's photographs seem to scream on the page," [...] Sengupta wrote. The photographs were taken just two years after those Bourke-White took of the newly captured Buchenwald.|$|E

2500|$|Tuchman {{also notes}} his use {{in his letters}} and diaries of a {{catalogue}} of now insulting words which she says [...] "he used easily and seemingly without pejorative content": these included [...] "limeys for the English, frogs for the French ("met a frog and his wife on shipboard"), huns and squareheads for Germans, wops for Italians, chinks or chinos for Chinese, googs for Filipinos, niggers or coons for Negroes", while {{at the end of}} the war Tuchman says he took [...] "a harsh pleasure in touring the gutted and burned-out districts of Yokohama <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the once arrogant [...] now living in shanties of scrap lumber and tin and scratching in the dirt to plant onions". His diary entry for 1 September 1945 (in Yokohama) reads in part: [...] "What a kick to stare at the arrogant, ugly, moon-faced, buck-toothed, bowlegged bastards, and realize where this puts them. Many newly demobilized soldiers around. Most police salute. People generally just apathetic. We gloated over the destruction & came in at 3:00 feeling fine." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{begins with}} Perry, {{sitting on the}} ground while mouthing the lyrics <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the camera. As she {{finishes}} the verse, the camera shifts to the ballroom, in which the dancers start to dance. The song's chorus kicks in, and she is now found in the ballroom, {{in the middle of all}} the dancers. As the second verse begins and she has an owl on her arm, which she lets go and flies. The bird represents [...] "something strong, free [...] powerful". Bonacorso added: [...] "She lets it go into the world and that literally letting this force within her go wild. That's an important part of love is that you have to let it go." [...] The video also shows Perry, with a golden dress and cross-shaped earrings, with flames on her body. By the second repetition of the chorus, a bed gets lit on fire, which the director included to refer to love that [...] "can burn you like an inferno". As the song reaches its climax, Perry gets hit by a car, with tiny broken debris from it shattering behind her, while she remains stationary and unharmed. This scene symbolizes the experience of true love, that changes [...] "your world" [...] and [...] "hits you out of the blue". This scene cuts to the ballroom, where Perry is surrounded by a similar explosion of [...] "colorful" [...] flowers, which is used to contrast the more violent nature of falling in love and the softer part of it, the [...] "joyful and wonderful" [...] feelings.|$|E
2500|$|When the Arvizo {{family and}} Jackson were on good terms, their mother, Janet, {{allegedly}} encouraged {{her children to}} call Jackson [...] "Daddy." [...] Janet, who also went by the names Janet Ventura and Janet Jackson, was identified as the most problematic of the prosecution witnesses. Besides her credibility issues, her behavior in the courtroom was widely criticized. Roger Friedman reported, [...] "it's pretty clear that she's mentally ill in some way" [...] and that [...] "when she first starts testifying, she's very sedate, and as time goes by, and possibly medication wears off, she becomes crazier and crazier, {{and you can hear}} people in the courtroom saying 'here it comes.'" [...] On a few occasions, the courtroom erupted in laughter over her answers. After the trial, jurors criticized her habit of snapping her fingers <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> them. She was often unresponsive even to the prosecution, was defensive over seemingly small issues, and was admonished by the judge for arguing. [...] She used repeated catchphrases such as, [...] "It's burned inside my memory," [...] and [...] "Money doesn't buy happiness." [...] She often answered questions with tangential speeches addressed directly to the jury, the press, or the defendant. [...] Defense attorney Tom Mesereau refused to object to her rambling and emotional diatribes, which resulted in prosecutor Sneddon repeatedly objecting to his own witness's answers. It was also revealed that Janet Arvizo had enrolled all three of her children in acting classes and had accused a JC Penney security guard of sexually molesting her in 1998. In February 2006, Janet Arvizo was convicted of welfare fraud for failing to report the $150,000 civil settlement in that case. She was sentenced to 150 hours of community service and an $8,600 fine.|$|E
