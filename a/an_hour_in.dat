5|$|Although {{onset of}} DCS can occur rapidly after a dive, {{in more than}} half of all cases {{symptoms}} do not begin to appear for at least <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> <b>In</b> extreme cases, symptoms may occur before the dive has been completed. The U.S. Navy and Technical Diving International, a leading technical diver training organization, have published a table that documents time to onset of first symptoms. The table does not differentiate between types of DCS, or types of symptom.|$|E
5|$|Black-backed and side-striped jackals, and African golden wolves {{will feed}} {{alongside}} hyenas, though {{they will be}} chased if they approach too closely. Spotted hyenas will sometimes follow jackals and wolves during the gazelle fawning season, as jackals and wolves are effective at tracking and catching young animals. Hyenas do not take to eating wolf flesh readily; four hyenas were reported to take half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>in</b> eating a golden wolf. Overall, the two animals typically ignore each other {{when there is no}} food or young at stake.|$|E

5|$|Black-shouldered kites live almost {{exclusively}} on mice, and have become a specialist predator of house mice, often following outbreaks of mouse plagues in rural areas. They take other suitably sized creatures when available, including grasshoppers, rats, small reptiles, birds, and even (very rarely) rabbits, but mice and other mouse-sized mammals account for over 90% of their diet. Their influence on mouse populations is probably significant: adults take two or three mice a day each if they can, around a thousand mice a year. On one occasion, a male was observed bringing no less than 14 mice to a nest of well-advanced fledglings within <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> <b>In</b> another study, a female kite was seen to struggle back to fledglings in the nest with a three-quarters grown rabbit, a heavy load for such a small bird.|$|E
5|$|In another case, 28-year-old British student Nathan Layton was {{bitten by}} a black mamba and {{died of a heart}} attack in less than <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>in</b> March 2008. The black mamba had been found near a {{classroom}} at the Southern African Wildlife College in Hoedspruit, where Layton was training to be a safari guide. Layton was bitten by the snake on his index finger while it was being put into a jar, but he didn't realize he'd been bitten. He thought the snake had only brushed his hand. Approximately 30 minutes after being bitten Layton complained of blurred vision. He collapsed and {{died of a heart attack}}, nearly an hour after being bitten. Attempts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead at the scene.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} Test, England were bowled out for 165 after Yardley won the toss and batted in {{difficult}} conditions. Wisden did not blame Yardley for the collapse as England did not bat well. He then set defensive fields to keep down Australia's scoring rate, taking a wicket {{himself with his}} fourth ball as part of figures of two for 32. The Australian batsmen {{found it difficult to}} score quickly against the negative tactics but still established a lead of 344. Yardley batted <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>in</b> the second innings to score 22 but Australia recorded an eight wicket win. Before the second Test, Yardley played for Yorkshire against the Australians, and although unsuccessful with the bat, took two for nine with the ball, his first wickets of the season for his county.|$|E

5|$|Inside No. 9 is an {{anthology}} series, with each episode featuring a new story, {{with a new}} setting and new characters. Episodes last around half an hour, with the self-contained story reaching a conclusion. The stories are linked only {{by the fact that}} each takes place in number 9, be that a mansion, a dressing room or a flat. Every episode stars at least one of Shearsmith or Pemberton, and normally both. Each episode is effectively a short play, and could easily be performed on stage. Most episodes take place in real-time, following half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>in</b> the lives of the characters.|$|E
5|$|Jerusalem and Dopesmoker are {{the final}} albums by the American heavy metal band Sleep. The albums were {{released}} in 1999 and 2003 respectively. The music for these albums was written during a four-year {{period when the}} group {{was working on a}} single song that was around <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>in</b> length. Sleep had signed with London Records, which financed the album. When recording had finished, London Records was unhappy with the finished product and refused to release it. The album was later released in various forms by different record labels. All versions of the album received very positive reception from music critics, who described it as a high-water mark in both the stoner metal and doom metal genres.|$|E
5|$|Singapore's LTA {{together}} with IBM, ran a pilot from December 2006 to April 2007, with a traffic estimation and prediction tool (TrEPS), which uses historical traffic data and real-time feeds with flow conditions from several sources, {{in order to}} predict the levels of congestion up to <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>in</b> advance. By accurately estimating prevailing and emerging traffic conditions, this technology is expected to allow variable pricing, {{together with}} improved overall traffic management, including the provision of information in advance to alert drivers about conditions ahead, and the prices being charged at that moment.|$|E

5|$|Steering {{currents}} above Alicia remained weak {{during the}} storm's lifetime. However, a ridge was well formed {{to the north}} of the developing storms. With fluctuations in the pressures, Alicia began to drift to west on August 16. This was short-lived, as Alicia turned to the northwest towards Texas. During the period of August 16 to August 18, an anticyclone had formed over Alicia and along with slow movement over warm waters, caused Alicia to intensify rapidly. The pressure in Alicia decreased one millibar <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>in</b> the 40hours before landfall. Alicia peaked at 115mph (185km/h) in winds and 962millibars (28.39inHg) in pressure on August 18. Alicia made landfall near Galveston on August 18 as a Category3hurricane. Alicia weakened quickly over land and accelerated over the Midwest, before dissipating over Nebraska on August 21.|$|E
5|$|The Friends of Richmond Park (FRP) {{was founded}} in 1961 to protect the park. In 1960 the speed limit in the park had been raised from 20 to 30 {{miles an hour and}} there were {{concerns}} that the roads in the park would be assigned to the main highway system as had recently happened in parts of Hyde Park. In 1969, plans by the then Greater London Council to assign the park's roads to the national highway were revealed by the Friends and subsequently withdrawn. The speed limit was reduced to 20 miles <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>in</b> the summer of 2004.|$|E
5|$|The Yorkshire team played three {{first-class}} {{matches in}} Jamaica in early 1936. Yorkshire {{won the first}} game, Jamaica's first defeat {{at home in a}} first-class game for 10 years. Verity took 10 for 106 in 57overs. The other matches, played on very good batting wickets, were drawn. In the final game, Verity scored 101, his only first-class century. Batting aggressively, he hit 10 fours and his second fifty runs came in just over <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> <b>In</b> total, Verity took 16wickets, averaging 22.50, and scored 195runs at 48.75.|$|E

5|$|The first {{landmarks}} of this mature style are {{the group}} of piano works published in 1907–1912 (the Elegies, the suite An die Jugend and the first two piano sonatinas) and Busoni's first completed opera, Die Brautwahl; together with the rather different Bach homage, the 1910 Fantasia contrappuntistica, Busoni's largest work for solo piano. About half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>in</b> length, it is essentially an extended fantasy on the final incomplete fugue from Bach's The Art of Fugue. It uses several melodic figures found in Bach's work, most notably the BACH motif. Busoni revised the work {{a number of times}} and arranged it for two pianos.|$|E
5|$|The most {{dangerous}} {{part of the}} operation was over by 02:15. The intruders had spent over <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>in</b> British airspace. Now the journey back over the sea to Germany and the Netherlands was undertaken. The British had jammed German radio beacons and switched on others with the same frequency. It was hoped the move would fool German pilots into landing in Britain in error. Experienced pilots did not fall for the ruse. Still, they had to fly over the sea by dead reckoning. A consequence of this showed that while around only five Ju 88s were lost in combat over England, eight crews were missing, three were killed in crash-landings and had died from their injuries, six crews had baled out 11 aircraft crashed or were damaged on landing.|$|E
5|$|Around {{midnight on}} Sunday morning, March 18, 1990, a red Dodge Daytona pulled {{up near the}} side {{entrance}} of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road. Two men with fake police uniforms waited for at least <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>in</b> the car, possibly trying to avoid being noticed by people leaving a St. Patrick's Day party nearby. Later at around 1a.m., security guard Richard Abath returned {{to the front desk}} after patrolling the museum to switch positions with the other security guard. The two guards were the only people in the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door, claiming he was trained to do this to ensure the door was locked. He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done this many times previously. The FBI has seized the logs, but has not commented on the issue further.|$|E

5|$|Days {{would be}} {{structured}} so that activities would be planned throughout, with occupational therapy carrying on into evenings and at weekends. A typical day would include breakfast then flower arranging until 10:30, followed by <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>in</b> the occupation room for therapy. After their work, the patients {{would go for}} a walk or join in community singing until 2pm. Between 2pm and 8pm there would be more time in the occupation room, a period of rest and time in the garden. At 8 pm there would be community games and country dancing. Casson believed it was important to keep the therapy room separate {{from the rest of the}} department, as it was specialised knowledge. She also insisted that certain activities, such as knitting, were not used as it was not sufficient distraction from the patient's fantasy system. Some concern existed that patients would not accept being put to work, but of her 100 patients in 1931, only six refused the therapy. A member (and later fellow) of the British Homeopathy Society, Casson also included homeopathic treatments in her programme for the patients.|$|E
5|$|Rightwise's {{new market}} cross only survived in its {{original}} form for a short time. During the English Reformation of the 1530s, the rood on the pinnacle was pulled down and the oratory became a storeroom. The octagonal plinth became a shopping arcade of small stalls. In 1549, a temporary gallows was erected at the cross for the mass execution of 60 {{of the participants in}} Kett's Rebellion, who had congregated in the marketplace during their brief capture of Norwich. In 1574, a local law was enacted demanding that all unemployed men were to assemble at the market cross each morning at 5.00am, along with the tools of their trade, and remain there for <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>in</b> the hope that they would be offered work; a bonesetter was hired to treat any men who claimed they were unfit for work through injury. The success of this scheme is not recorded.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodesian {{pursued the}} He111 over the Saltdal valley and, with three attacks from astern, set the bomber ablaze, forcing it to crash. Hull then downed a Junkers Ju52 {{transport}} plane and, after unsuccessfully chasing another He111, destroyed two more Ju52s. The transports {{had been coming}} {{to the aid of}} the hard-pressed German forces fighting around Narvik; one was loaded with supplies, while the other two were carrying Fallschirmjäger paratroops. One of the latter aircraft successfully landed in German-held territory before burning out, allowing the crew and paratroopers aboard to exit safely, but the second spiralled out of control and crashed, killing eight German paratroopers. Hull then attacked another He111, which soon retreated, giving off smoke. Having used up all his ammunition, Hull returned to Bodø. In the space of about <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> <b>in</b> a technologically-outdated aircraft and without assistance, he had destroyed four German planes and damaged a fifth.|$|E
