Bart and Lisa come down, only {{to realize that the}} picture on one of the phone books is not the one of the fire on Mt. Springfield; it is actually a photo of baby Bart and Lisa naked on the toilet, causing them to scream in horror. Marge says that the shot was actually in the film on the camera, and that since she had taken it, she won the prize for them. Bart and Lisa, after accepting that they will be the laughingstock of the entire town, happily hug their mother. Meanwhile, Barney's confidence and his relationship with Homer are restored, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> forward to an alcohol-free future, although he is now addicted to double-tall mocha lattes.|$|E

5000|$|Fred Williamson {{was cast}} in the lead. Cohen says, [...] "Fred was totally {{different}} than what Sammy would have played, because Fred was a handsome leading man. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> great in the clothes, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> great in that hat that I put on him. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> could strut through Harlem, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> like the Godfather of Harlem." ...|$|R

25|$|His final {{departure}} from Rome {{was motivated by}} a solemn weariness of the burdens imposed on him by his social position, and apparently the difficulties of meeting the ordinary expenses {{of living in the}} bustling metropolis (x. 96); <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> smilingly ever forward to a return to the rosy scenes familiar to his youth, apparently. The well-known epigram addressed to Juvenal (xii. I 8) shows that for a time his ideal was happily realized; but the more trustworthy evidence of the dry prose epistle prefixed to Book XII. proves and that he could not live happily away from the literary and social pleasures of Rome for long. The one consolation of his exile was a lady, Marcella, of whom he writes rather platonically as if she were his patronessand it {{seems to have been a}} necessity of his being to have always a patron or patronessthan his wife or mistress or harlot or muse or shrewish burden.|$|E
25|$|Townspeople sing joyfully of {{the peace}} that will follow the {{imminent}} wedding of the prince of Mantua and the princess of Bavaria. Young people look forward to songs and dancing, {{and a group of}} prisoners released by the King celebrate. A group of impoverished students, Spark, Hartmann, Facio enter hoping also to share in some fun while contemptuous of the townspeople. The King and his guards emerge from the palace. The King announces the arrival of the prince of Mantua to wed his daughter Elsbeth and encourages the celebration. A courtier explains that Elsbeth is grieving on the death of the court jester of whom she was fond. Marinoni, the prince of Mantua's aide-de-camp enquires about the festivities and the princess, but is mocked by the students. Fantasio enters and sings a ballad to the moon. The page of Elsbeth enters to tell the students to keep their voices down as they will disturb the princess; they enter the tavern. Elsbeth sings of her wonder at the change in her life, but Fantasio enters unseen and asks her if she is really in love – with a complete stranger. Elsbeth, startled, leaves repeating Fantasio's words. When Spark joins his friend Fantasio talks extravagantly of his feelings. Soon the funeral cortege of court jester St Jean passes by and Fantasio has the idea to take the appearance of the jester {{to gain access to the}} princess, and he and Spark enter the nearby tailor's shop to get the costume. This will also help him avoid being arrested for his debts by the police. The fatuous prince of Mantua and his aide Marinoni enter, and the prince, wanting to discover the real thoughts and feelings of his future wife determines to dress as a servant to find out; he and Marinoni exit to exchange their clothes. The students come in singing and Fantasio re-appears dressed as the old jester. Two sentries mistakenly let him into the palace grounds <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> forward to his adventure and to meeting Elsbeth again.|$|E

Miranda explains that she didn't know any of that. Colin is later hanging out with Sal. Colin then asks Miranda {{if she wants to}} hang out. Miranda declines saying that her mom is sick. Later on, someone taps on her door which scares her because she doesn't know anyone that knocks like that. She looks though the peep hole [...] and sees Colin.

500|$|Following the war, {{he settled}} in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. {{for two years}} {{with his wife and}} young son. During this time, he worked on {{reassignment}} of warrant and chief petty officers from the navy. Callaghan next served aboard the newly commissioned battleship , commencing in October 1920. While his family moved back to Oakland, he began serving as a fire control officer on the Idaho. He left the Idaho in June 1923, returning to shore duties for two years before taking up the position of First Lieutenant on the [...] in May 1925. The Colorado transported a shipment of gold to Australia before returning to the United States in 1926. His next assignment was the position of gunnery officer, on board the [...] Captain Thomas Hart wrote of Callaghan: [...] "I can scarcely report too favorably on this officer. He is excellent generally and particularly; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> and acts the part. As gunnery officer, he is being highly successful and I unhesitatingly recommend him for almost any detail." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jonathan Collier, who is a huge boxing fan. Knowing that {{the people on the}} {{internet}} would [...] "give them grief", the writers went to a lot of effort to explain how Homer would be able to challenge for the Heavyweight Title. A lot of the scenes involving Homer fighting hobos were pitched by John Swartzwelder. Lucius Sweet is a parody of boxing promoter Don King, and is voiced by Paul Winfield, who had previously played King in HBO's 1995 biopic Tyson. In the script, Sweet was described as [...] "A Don King type who looks and sounds exactly like Don King". The similarity is even pointed out by Homer with the line, [...] "He is exactly as rich and as famous as Don King – <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> just like him, too!". King was asked to guest star, but turned the part down. Drederick Tatum is a parody of Mike Tyson. The name came from George Meyer, who went to high school with a boy named Drederick Timmins, which Meyer thought was a cool name. Tatum having done time in prison is a reference to the fact that, {{at the time of the}} episode's production, Tyson had just recently been released from prison after serving three years for rape. Homer is at one point referred to as [...] "The Southern Dandy" [...] as a reference to the old-time boxers and wrestlers who had similar nicknames.|$|E
500|$|The Archangel Michael, the {{embodiment}} and conduit of divine justice, is positioned directly below Christ, the only figure to reach both Heaven and Earth. He wears a dispassionate expression as {{he holds a}} set of scales to weigh souls. Unusually for Christian art, the damned outweigh the blessed; Michael's scales have only one soul in each pan, yet the left pan tips below the right. Michael is given unusual prominence in a [...] "Last Judgement" [...] for the period, and his powerful presence emphasises the work's function in a hospice and its preoccupation with the liturgy of death. His feet are positioned {{as if he is}} stepping forward, almost about {{to move out of the}} canvas <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> directly at the viewer, giving the illusion of judging not only the souls in the painting but also the viewers. Michael, like Sebastian and Anthony, was a plague saint and would have been visible to inmates through the openings of the pierced screen as they lay in their beds. Michael is painted with iconographic elements associated with paintings of the Last Judgement, and is by far the most beautifully and colourfully painted figure; he is dressed in a red cope with woven golden fabrics over a shining white alb, which dominates the lower panels, [...] "hypnotically attracting the viewer's glance" [...] according to Lane. He is surrounded by four cherubs, playing trumpets to call the dead to their final destination. Michael's role in the Last Judgement is emphasised through van der Weyden's use of colour: Michael's gleaming white alb contrasts with the cherub's red vestments, set against a blue sky directly below heaven's golden clouds.|$|E

2500|$|Gullit's {{brilliance}} prompted George Best {{to comment}} in 1990, [...] "Ruud Gullit {{is a great}} player by any standards. He has all the skills. He's not afraid to do things with the ball. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> as if he's enjoying every second of it. By my reckoning that's what makes him an even better player than Maradona. Both have the key quality you will find in all the best players: balance. You just can't knock them off the ball. It was the same with Pelé, Beckenbauer and Cruyff." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{a college}} player {{he took the}} {{nickname}} [...] "The Jewish Hammer" [...] or [...] "The Hammer". [...] He explains that as The Hebrew Hammer was taken [...] "they {{had to come up}} with something else", and that the [...] "hammer" [...] aspect refers to his penchant for throwing opposing players down on the field. [...] A more recent nickname, following his being picked by the Chicago Bears, is [...] "The Bear Jew", a reference to a character in the 2009 film [...] "Inglourious Basterds". [...] One of his favorite Jewish football players was a former Badger, Matt Bernstein, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> to 49ers former offensive linesman Harris Barton as a role model.|$|E

2500|$|In 1930, Gable and Josephine Dillon were divorced. A {{few days}} later, he married Texas socialite Maria Franklin Prentiss Lucas Langham, nicknamed [...] "Rhea". After moving to California, {{they were married}} again in 1931, {{possibly}} {{due to differences in}} state legal requirements. [...] "His ears are too big <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> like an ape", said executive Darryl F. Zanuck, then at Warner Bros., about Gable after testing him for the lead in the studio's gangster drama Little Caesar (1931). The same year, in Night Nurse, Gable played a villainous chauffeur who was gradually starving two adorable little girls to death, then knocked Barbara Stanwyck's character unconscious with his fist, a supporting role originally slated for James Cagney until the release of The Public Enemy abruptly made Cagney a leading man. After several failed screen tests for Barrymore and Zanuck, Gable was signed in 1930 by MGM's Irving Thalberg. He became a client of well-connected agent Minna Wallis, sister of producer Hal Wallis and a very close friend of Norma Shearer.|$|E
2500|$|Joey and Topthorn {{are used}} by the Germans to haul {{artillery}} up a large muddy hill, {{under the command of}} Private Friedrich Henglemann, who tries to keep the horses alive. Topthorn eventually succumbs to exhaustion and dies. Friedrich is dragged away by other German soldiers, leaving Joey to face an oncoming Mark IV tank. The horse escapes and runs into no-man's land, where he gets entangled in the barbed wire barriers. From their respective trenches, both British and German soldiers spot Joey in the night mist, and a British soldier named Colin, waves a white flag and tries to free the horse. Peter (Hinnerk Schönemann), a German soldier, comes over with wire cutters, and together they free Joey from the wire. The two make friendly talk on the remorseless war. They flip a coin, provided by Peter, to decide who should take the horse; Colin, who called heads, wins (Peter remarks, on seeing the coin land in the mud heads up, [...] "Aye, that is my Kaiser, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> none too pleased with me!") and guides Joey back to the British trench, now having made friends with Peter.|$|E

2500|$|God created space-time {{along with}} all reality an {{indefinite}} time ago and created out of love {{for those who would}} be His children. Ruling from Heaven on high and [...] "working in mysterious ways", He guides Creation to the ultimate good of His creations. All beings are His creations <b>and</b> <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> at them all as His children. Indeed, His Christian worshippers refer to Him as Father. However, not all wish to accept His love and even reject Him and His goodness altogether. In the beginning, one of His creations, Lucifer rejected God's wisdom and, thinking that he could be a superior leader than his omniscient Creator, sought to take the throne of Heaven. Lucifer's War of Heaven and rebellion against God and His goodness {{led to the creation of}} evil. To delilver His children whom He so loved of evil, He sent Jesus, His only begotten Son and even sacrificed His life so that whoever believes in Him should not die but have eternal life. Afterwards, God made His will known through the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church that His Son established on Saint Peter.|$|E
2500|$|As Christmas arrives, the New York Combat Revue {{prepares for}} their Christmas show. Shinjiro {{goes on a}} date with a member of the Star Division. After {{performing}} their Christmas show, Azuchi Castle appears in New York. The leader of the demon forces is revealed to be Oda Nobunaga, [...] "Sixth Heaven Demon Lord". The Star Division goes out to attack Azuchi Castle. They destroy the remains of Ranmaru's robot, only for Shinjiro to be severely injured by Nobunaga. When he recovers and helps the Star Division repel an attack on Little Lip Theater, the Sixth Heaven appears over New York. After resolving to fight Nobunaga without sacrificing anyone to the Five-Ring Mandala, the only method to seal Nobunaga, Shinjiro is promoted to the rank of Captain as they go off to fight Nobunaga. The Revue uses the Ahab, the Star Division's airship, to attack Azuchi Castle. The party battle their way through Nobunaga's defenses and their dark clones. However, Shinjiro is inside his dark clone when he arrives near Nobunaga. He manages to escape the dark clone after many pleas from the Star Division and defeats it. Making a final stand against Nobunaga, the Star Division defeats him, but Nobunaga comes out alive <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> into Shinjiro's feelings.

2500|$|Brando played Sakini, a Japanese {{interpreter}} for the U.S. Army {{in postwar}} Japan, in The Teahouse of the August Moon (1956). Pauline Kael {{was not particularly}} impressed by the movie, but noted [...] "Marlon Brando starved himself to play the pixie interpreter Sakini, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> as if he's enjoying the stunt—talking with a mad accent, grinning boyishly, bending forward, and doing tricky movements with his legs. He's harmlessly genial (and he is certainly missed when he's offscreen), though the fey, roguish role doesn't allow him to do what he's great at and it's possible that he's less effective in it than a lesser actor might have been." [...] In Sayonara (1957) he appeared as a United States Air Force officer. Newsweek found the film a [...] "dull tale of {{the meeting of the}} twain", but it was nevertheless a box office success. According to Stefan Kanfer's biography of the actor, Brando's manager Jay Kanter negotiated a profitable contract with ten percent of the gross going to Brando, which put him in the millionaire category. The movie was controversial due to openly discussing interracial marriage, but proved a great success, earning 10 Academy Award nominations, with Brando being nominated for Best Actor. The film went on to win four Academy Awards. Teahouse and Sayonara were the first in a string of films Brando would strive to make over the next decade which contained socially relevant messages, and he formed a partnership with Paramount to establish his own production company called Pennebaker, its declared purpose to develop films that contained [...] "social value that would improve the world." [...] The name was a tribute in honor of his mother, who had died in 1954. By all accounts, Brando was devastated by her death, with biographer Peter Manso telling A's Biography, [...] "She was the one who could give him approval like no one else could and, after his mother died, it seems that Marlon stops caring." [...] Brando appointed his father to run Pennebaker. In the same A special, George Englund claims that Brando gave his father the job because [...] "it gave Marlon a chance to take shots at him, to demean and diminish him".|$|E
