50|$|Even {{though the}} U.S. has imposed a US$0.54 tariff on every gallon of {{imported}} ethanol since 1980, the Caribbean nations and Central American countries {{are exempt from}} such duties based on the benefits granted by the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). CBI provisions allow tariff-free access to the US market from ethanol produced from foreign feedstock (outside CBI countries) up to 7% {{of the previous year}} US consumption. Also <b>additional</b> <b>quotas</b> are allowed if the beneficiary countries produce at least 30% of the ethanol from local feedstocks up to an additional 35 million gallons (132.5 million liters). Thus, several countries have been importing hydrated ethanol from Brazil, processing it at local distilleries to dehydrate it, and then re-exporting it as anhydrous ethanol. American farmers have complained about this loophole to legally bypass the tariff. The 2005 Dominican Republic - Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) maintained the benefits granted by the CBI, and CAFTA provisions established country-specific shares for Costa Rica and El Salvador within the overall quota. An initial annual allowance was established for each country, with gradually increasing annual levels of access to the US market. The expectation is that using Brazilian technology for refining sugar cane-based ethanol, such countries could become net exporters to the United States in the short-term. In August 2007, Brazil's President toured Mexico and several countries in Central America and the Caribbean to promote Brazilian ethanol technology.|$|E
40|$|The {{compromise}} text for {{reform of the}} CAP was distributed at the June EU Agricultural Council meeting. It proposed a number of changes, notably: establishing an earlier start date for modulation; increasing support for young farmers through the rural development regulation; the maintenance of rotational set aside; the exclusion of certain payments from decoupling, including sheep and goat supplementary payments in less favoured and mountain regions, drying aid for cereals, and direct payments in outermost regions. A decision on <b>additional</b> <b>quotas</b> in the dairy sector was deferred as was decoupling pending the full implementation of dairy sector reform. A decision on the {{compromise text}} was deferred to allow member states more time to reflect. Comment: The decision to defer decoupling in the dairy sector until reform is completed, gives a clear indication that for other sectors such as sugar, substantial reform involving price reductions and increased product-specific direct aid payments will have to precede the incorporation of the sector into the single decoupled farm aid payments scheme. The compromise text for reform of the CAP was distributed at the [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The use of tariff-rate quotas as a {{protectionist}} device has not {{yet been}} quite well understood. There is a widespread understanding that the offer of an <b>additional</b> tariff <b>quota</b> will generate a growth in the volume exported equivalent to the extra amount yielded. However, this may not happen, due to the characteristics of the tariff-quota system. Given the demand curve for a certain product, only one of the three components of the tariff-quota mechanism is determinant in restraining imports: the volume of the quota, the in-quota or the extra-quota. In addition, the estimate of gains in the value exported must include the increase in the ?quota-rent? allowed by the <b>additional</b> <b>quota.</b> This paper aims to point out the importance of an accurate assessment of the effects of <b>additional</b> tariff <b>quotas</b> for some Brazilian agricultural exports. The study focuses on the case of the offer made by the European Union in the negotiations for a Mercosur-EU free trade agreement. ...|$|R
