5|$|H to He, Who <b>Am</b> <b>the</b> <b>Only</b> One is {{the third}} album by the British {{progressive}} rock band Van der Graaf Generator. It was released in 1970 on Charisma Records.|$|E
5|$|The band {{formed at}} Manchester University, but settled in London where they signed with Charisma. They {{went through a}} number of incarnations in their early years, {{including}} a brief split in 1969. When they reformed, they found minor commercial success with The Least We Can Do Is Wave to Each Other (February 1970), and after the follow-up album, H to He, Who <b>Am</b> <b>the</b> <b>Only</b> One (December 1970), stabilised around a line-up of Hammill, organist Hugh Banton, saxophonist David Jackson, and drummer Guy Evans. The quartet subsequently achieved significant success in Italy with the release of Pawn Hearts in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Potter, however, did {{not feel}} he fitted into this {{increasingly}} experimental sound the band was developing and tended {{to wait until the}} others had worked out their parts during rehearsals, adding his bass lines on top at the last minute. After recording three tracks of their third album, H to He, Who <b>Am</b> <b>the</b> <b>Only</b> One (December 1970), he decided to quit the band. His last gig was on 9 August at the 1970 Plumpton Festival. The remaining members auditioned Dave Anderson, roadie for Brinsley Schwarz and friend of the band, but after a week's rehearsal found that things weren't working out musically. Banton, meanwhile, had become influenced by Vincent Crane's work in Atomic Rooster, where Crane played the bass lines on a Hammond organ's bass pedals and suggested that he could do this as well. With just days to go before the next gig, they tried rehearsing as a four-piece, and it was successful. Banton later played bass guitar on certain songs, having already learned the instrument in the mid-1960s, and Hammill expanded his instrumental capabilities on stage to cover piano and keyboards as well as guitar. Jackson modified his saxophones to be completely electric, as opposed to simply being amplified through a microphone, and combined the sound with a wah-wah pedal and an octave divider.|$|E

500|$|Martin's mother remarked, [...] "Whoever he is now, he's {{the person}} the prison service trained him to be. These bastards {{have no right}} to take my son's life. I brought him into the world. I <b>am</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> person who can take him out of it." [...] However, no one {{formally}} protested against the hanging. At dawn on 19 April 1996, Martin was hanged in Changi Prison together with two Singaporean drug traffickers. On that day, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Royal Thai Police closed their files on the murders of Sheila and Darin Damude, declaring the case effectively solved.|$|E
500|$|The Hammill/Banton/Jackson/Evans quartet that {{resulted}} from H to He, Who <b>Am</b> <b>the</b> <b>Only</b> One is now considered the [...] "classic" [...] line-up, {{and went on to}} play as part of the 'Six Bob Tour' in early 1971 with fellow Charisma labelmates Genesis and Lindisfarne. Despite the complexity of their music, the band were well received on the tour, with Hammill noting [...] "at nearly all the gigs, most of the audience have known most of the songs... It was like a big family actually, exactly as all of us had pictured it in our wildest dreams." ...|$|E
500|$|Hammill's {{split with}} the group was amicable, and Banton, Jackson, and Evans, among others, all contributed to his solo work at various times. By 1975, {{the members of the}} band were ready to work with each other again, and they decided to reform the band. All the members were keen on {{carrying}} on with new music, with no nostalgia for their previous era, {{and did not want to}} play earlier stage favourites such as [...] "Killer" [...] (the opening track on H to He, Who <b>Am</b> <b>the</b> <b>Only</b> One) and [...] "Theme One". [...] "We didn't want to continue as if nothing had happened," [...] said Hammill.|$|E

500|$|The {{relationship}} between Maria Theresa and Joseph {{was not without}} warmth but was complicated and their personalities clashed. Despite his intellect, Maria Theresa's force of personality often made Joseph cower. Sometimes, she openly admired his talents and achievements, but criticised him behind his back. She wrote: [...] "We never see each other except at dinner ... His temper gets worse every day ... Please burn this letter ... I just try to avoid public scandal." [...] In another letter, also addressed to Joseph's companion, she complained: [...] "He avoids me ... I <b>am</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> person in his way and so I am an obstruction and a burden ... Abdication alone can remedy matters." ...|$|E
500|$|Subsequently, on 4 February 2010, he {{announced}} his decision to retire, after discussing the matter at {{a meeting with the}} Board of Directors of the Sumo Association. He stated, [...] "I feel heavy responsibility as a yokozuna that I have caused trouble to so many people. I <b>am</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> person who can put an end to it all. I think it's my destiny that I retire like this." [...] Asashōryū did not comment directly on the brawl, except to say that what actually happened was [...] "quite different" [...] to media reports. [...] "I decided to step down to bring this to a closure." ...|$|E
500|$|When the Van der Graaf Generator {{catalogue}} was remastered for reissue in 2005, {{several of}} the tracks from the missing half of the album were found and added as bonus tracks. A live, in-studio version of [...] "Squid/Octopus" [...] {{was added to the}} H to He, Who <b>Am</b> <b>the</b> <b>Only</b> One reissue, while the Pawn Hearts reissue added [...] "Angle of Incidents", [...] "Ponker's Theme", and [...] "Diminutions". The CD also contained the original mix of [...] "Theme One", which is different to the one released as a single, and an earlier take of [...] "W". [...] "Theme One" [...] was also released on the 2003 compilation CD The Best Prog Rock Album in the World... Ever.|$|E

500|$|With Elizabeth's accession, {{it seemed}} {{probable}} that the royal house would bear her husband's name, becoming the House of Mountbatten, {{in line with}} the custom of a wife taking her husband's surname on marriage. The British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and Elizabeth's grandmother, Queen Mary, favoured the retention of the House of Windsor, and so on 9 April 1952 Elizabeth issued a declaration that Windsor would continue to be the name of the royal house. The Duke complained, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children." [...] In 1960, after the death of Queen Mary in 1953 and the resignation of Churchill in 1955, the surname Mountbatten-Windsor was adopted for Philip and Elizabeth's male-line descendants who do not carry royal titles.|$|E
500|$|He {{transferred}} to the Royal Air Force when the RNAS and the RFC were merged on 1 April 1918. The creation of the Royal Air Force did not initially {{have a big impact}} on Allingham and he later remarked that at that time he still considered himself a navy man. [...] In the RAF he was ranked as a Rigger Aero, Aircraft Mechanic Second Class and was given a new service number: 208317. Allingham returned to the Home Establishment in February 1919 and was formally discharged to the RAF Reserve on 16 April 1919. During the last few years of his life Allingham was recognized as the last surviving founding member of the RAF. Speaking with Dennis Goodwin of the First World War Veterans' Association, Allingham said, [...] "It is a shock as well as a privilege to think that I <b>am</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> man alive from that original reorganisation when the RAF was formed." ...|$|E
500|$|At first, Angelou {{intended}} {{to return to}} poetry and play-writing after completing Caged Bird and write no more autobiographies, but she chose the genre as her primary mode of expression because of its challenge and {{so that she could}} [...] "change it, to make it bigger, richer, finer, and more inclusive in the twentieth century". In a 1989 interview, she stated, [...] "I think I <b>am</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> serious writer who has chosen the autobiographical form to carry my work, my expression". [...] As she told journalist George Plimpton during a 1990 interview, [...] "Autobiography is awfully seductive; it’s wonderful". [...] She also told Plimpton that like the tradition begun by Frederick Douglass in slave narratives, she used the literary technique of [...] "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'". [...] As critic Susan Gilbert states, Angelou was reporting not one person's story, but the collective's. [...] Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe agrees, and sees Angelou as representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people.|$|E

500|$|Both {{newspapers}} {{went into}} gradual decline under their new proprietors. James Gordon Bennett, Jr.—"a swaggering, precociously dissolute lout who rarely stifled an impulse"—had a mercurial reign. He launched the New York Telegram, an evening paper, {{in the late}} 1860s and kept the Herald the most comprehensive source of news among the city's newspapers. [...] Bennett also bankrolled Henry Morton Stanley's trek through Africa to find David Livingstone, and scooped the competition on the Battle of Little Big Horn. However, Bennett ruled his paper with a heavy hand, telling his executives {{at one point that}} he was the [...] "only reader of this paper": [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> one to be pleased. [...] If I want it turned upside down, it must be turned upside down. [...] I want one feature article a day. If I say the feature is black beetles, black beetles it's going to be." [...] In 1874, the Herald ran the infamous New York Zoo hoax, where {{the front page of the}} newspaper was devoted entirely to fabricated story of animals getting loose at the Central Park Zoo.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the tour}} and in {{preparation}} for the album, Hammill invited producer John Anthony to his home, where Hammill played songs intended for the album unaccompanied on acoustic guitar and piano, allowing Anthony to take recording notes. [...] "Man Erg" [...] was written about the conflict between good and evil, represented as [...] "angels" [...] and [...] "killers" [...] in the song. [...] "A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers" [...] was inspired by Hammill's fascination with the sea, and the narrative is about a lighthouse keeper who keeps seeing people die offshore. He feels guilty {{about not being able to}} help, and the song's ending is left open, leaving the listener to decide if the keeper has committed suicide or rationalised events to live in peace. Banton was against putting [...] "A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers" [...] on the album, wanting more commercial material such as the previous album H to He, Who <b>Am</b> <b>the</b> <b>Only</b> One's [...] "Killer", but after a band meeting he agreed to rehearse the song and worked out an arrangement. The group moved to manager Tony Stratton-Smith's house, Luxford House, Crowborough, Sussex for two months in summer 1971 to rehearse material.|$|E
2500|$|On a September 2009 Alex Jones Show segment, Grayson criticized Federal Reserve Chair Bernanke's {{senior adviser}} Linda Robertson, saying [...] "Here I <b>am</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> member of Congress who {{actually}} {{worked as an}} economist, this lobbyist, this K-Street whore, is trying to teach me about economics!" [...] Robertson had previously worked as a lobbyist for Enron. Grayson's language was widely criticized as inappropriate, and Grayson apologized.|$|E

2500|$|During King Crimson's less active periods, Fripp {{pursued a}} number of side-projects. He worked with Keith Tippett (and others who {{appeared}} on King Crimson records) on projects far from rock music, playing with and producing Centipede's Septober Energy in 1971 and Ovary Lodge in 1973. During this period he also worked with Van der Graaf Generator, playing on the 1970 album H to He, Who <b>Am</b> <b>the</b> <b>Only</b> One, and in 1971, on Pawn Hearts. He produced Matching Mole's 2nd LP Matching Mole's Little Red Record in 1972. Prior to forming the Larks-era KC, he collaborated on a spoken-word album with a woman he described as [...] "a witch" [...] but the resulting recording - Robert Fripp & Walli Elmark: The Cosmic Children Of Love - was never officially released.|$|E
2500|$|Dee's Speculum or Mirror (an {{obsidian}} Aztec cult {{object in}} the shape of a hand-mirror, brought to Europe in the late 1520s), which was subsequently owned by Horace Walpole. Jennifer Rampling has claimed that Dee never actually owned this object. The item now residing in the British Museum was first attributed to Dee by Horace Walpole. Lord Frederick Campbell had brought [...] "a round piece of shining black marble in a leathern case" [...] to Walpole in an attempt to ascertain the object's provenance. According to Walpole, he responded saying [...] "Oh, Lord, I <b>am</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> man in England that can tell you! It is Dr. Dee's black stone". There is no explicit reference to the mirror in any of Dee's surviving writings. The provenance of the Museum's obsidian speculum, as well as the crystal ball, is in fact dubious.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accession}} of Elizabeth to {{the throne}} brought up {{the question of the}} name of the royal house. The Duke's uncle, Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, advocated the name House of Mountbatten, as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philip's last name on marriage; however, when Queen Mary, Elizabeth's grandmother, heard of this suggestion, she informed the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who himself later advised the Queen to issue a royal proclamation declaring that the royal house was to remain known as the House of Windsor. Churchill's strong personal antipathy to Lord Mountbatten, whom he considered a dangerous and subversive rival who had lost India, may have contributed to this. Prince Philip privately complained, [...] "I am nothing but a bloody amoeba. I <b>am</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children." ...|$|E
