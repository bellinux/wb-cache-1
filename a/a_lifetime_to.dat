One successful survivor is Avery Weigh-Tronix on Foundry Lane, the world's largest manufacturers of machines for weighing, counting, measuring and testing, whose main entrance is the frontage of Boulton's and Watt's old Soho Foundry opposite the 'Soho Foundry Tavern'.|$|E

2500|$|This {{painstaking}} {{style of}} writing {{is also evident}} when one compares Flaubert’s output over <b>a</b> <b>lifetime</b> <b>to</b> that of his peers (for example Balzac or Zola).

[...] Compensation has evolved gradually moving away from fixed short-term immediate compensation towards fixed + variable outcomes-based compensation. An increase in knowledge-based work has also led to pursuit of partner (as opposed to employee) like engagement.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, while {{campaigning for}} the Republican {{nomination}} for president, Gingrich became the [...] "loudest and fiercest critic" [...] among a Republican field of [...] "judicial-branch haters," [...] frequently criticizing federal judges and judges. In December 2011, Gingrich termed the courts [...] "grotesquely dictatorial {{and far too}} powerful" [...] and said that as president, he would abolish whole courts whose decisions he disagrees with, asking [...] "Are we forced for <b>a</b> <b>lifetime</b> <b>to</b> keep someone on the bench who is so radically anti-American {{that they are a}} threat to the fabric of the country?" [...] Gingrich has particularly singled out the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for criticism, saying that it should be abolished because it is [...] too liberal and [...] "radically Anti-American." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mayo said, at {{the close}} of her Senate Committee testimony, [...] "I was burned by sexual abuse in the early 70’s; we’re being burned by the false {{accusation}} of it now. An internet lynch mob can go on forever, but the law should protect innocent people from legal charges they can’t defend, like those from the distant past. The current statute gives survivors sufficient time for litigation, and <b>a</b> <b>lifetime</b> <b>to</b> bring charges to criminal court. Survivors and non-survivors alike need legal protection. The law as it stands, does both. Until you’ve experienced your life ripped open by false accusations, please consider that what happened to us can happen to anyone. That puts this proposal squarely in the category of more-harm-than-good." ...|$|E

[...] "The nearly 80-year-old popular plot at the Machpelah Cemetery has fallen into disrepair over the years." [...] "The Houdini Museum has teamed with The Society of American Magicians, {{one of the oldest}} fraternal magic organizations in the world, to give the beloved site a facelift." [...] The organization has a specific Houdini gravesite committee made up of nine members headed up by President elect David Bowers who brought this project to the Society's attention. Kenrick [...] "Ice" [...] McDonald, the current president of the Society of American Magicians said [...] "You have to know the history. Houdini served as President from 1917 until his death in 1926. Houdini's burial site needs an infusion of cash to restore it to its former glory." [...] Magician Dietrich said the repairs could cost [...] "tens of thousands of dollars", after consulting with glass experts and grave artisans. [...] "It's a wonderful project, but it's taken <b>a</b> <b>lifetime</b> <b>to</b> get people interested," [...] she said. [...] "It's long overdue, and it's great that it's happening." [...] Houdini was a living superhero," [...] Dietrich said. [...] "He wasn't just a magician and escape artist, he was a great humanitarian." [...] To this day, the Society holds a broken wand ceremony at the grave every November.|$|E
