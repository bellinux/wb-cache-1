40|$|Agriculture, in general, and {{agricultural}} exports in particular, {{have long been}} critical to economic growth and development in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Despite the importance of agriculture to {{the region and the}} vast amount of resources devoted to the promotion of <b>agricultural</b> export <b>diversification</b> in LAC, there has been virtually no research undertaken to assess {{the degree to which the}} agricultural export structures in LAC countries have in fact diversified. Using disaggregate data on agricultural exports over the 1961 - 2000 period for 10 LAC countries, entropy-based measures of diversification are computed and analyzed. The empirical results show that the post- 1985 period has witnessed some degree of <b>agricultural</b> export <b>diversification</b> in LAC.

50|$|In the <b>agricultural</b> context, <b>diversification</b> can be {{regarded}} as the re-allocation of some of a farm's productive resources, such as land, capital, farm equipment and pices to other farmers and, particularly in richer countries, non-farming activities such as restaurants and shops. Factors leading to decisions to diversify are many, but include; reducing risk, responding to changing consumer demands or changing government policy, responding to external shocks and, more recently, as a consequence of climate change.|$|R

This paper designs two game models to analyse the dualism of asymmetric information in agricultural insurance and its reasons of forming.

Therefore, this paper puts forward that establishment of appropriate agricultural insurance mode, optimization of insurance policy design and increasing investment in science and technology, increasing farmers’ insurance consciousness and establishing supervision syste...|$|R

The results highlight {{that the vast majority}} of farmers in the enlarged EU retain a productivist mindset, wish to maintain an agricultural focus and strongly reject notions of policy liberalisation. However, while the overwhelming majority advocate protection they are more receptive to greater flexibility in terms of the instruments through which policy support may be delivered. Overall, the strongest opposition to policy liberalisation comes from farmers in the New Member States of the EU...|$|R

40|$|We {{measure the}} impact of the Farmers Income Diversification Program (FIDP), an EU funded program {{implemented}} in Malawi from late 2005 onwards, aiming at increasing <b>agricultural</b> productivity, <b>diversification,</b> value addition, commercialization and trade of subsistence farmers. The geographical spread of the implementation of FIDP is exploited to identify its impact. Computations are based on annual data by Extension Planning Area, 198 in total, fully covering Malawi, for the period 2003 - 04 to 2009 - 10. The estimations support a statistically significant impact of FIDP on agricultural productivity, with increases reaching 20 % to 24 % relative to base period levels, with a lag of at least one year after the start of the program and increasing over the years. Evidence on diversification of crop income is less strong but still suggests increases ranging from 5 % to 10 %.

40|$|Global {{trends in}} human {{population}} and agriculture dictate that future calls {{made on the}} resources (physical, human, financial) and systems involved in producing food will be increasingly more demanding and complex.

By reflecting on current trends in <b>agricultural</b> production (<b>diversification,</b> intensification, integration, industrialisation, automation) and deconstructing a futuristic scenario of attempting agricultural production on Mars, it seems the skills agronomists will require involve not only the mandatory elements of their discipline but also additional skills that enable engagement with, even leadership of, teams who integrate (in sum or part) engineering, (agri-) business, economics and operational management, and build the social capital required to create and maintain a diverse array of enhanced and new ethical production systems and achieve increasing efficiencies within them...|$|R

40|$|Crop {{diversification}} {{is commonly}} {{regarded as a}} risk reducing strategy to moderate the impacts of variable crop prices and yields. The addition {{of one or more}} livestock enterprises may lead to still greater income stability for an <b>agricultural</b> producer. <b>Diversification</b> reduces income volatility whenever low returns in one enterprise are associated with relatively moderate or high returns in another enterprise. The reverse phenomenon (moderate or relatively high returns in the first enterprise, occurring during years of low returns for the second enterprise) is also necessary for diversification to be effective. The greater the tendency for enterprise returns from different enterprises to 2 ̆ 2 offset 2 ̆ 2 each other, the greater the effectiveness of enterprise diversification. The disadvantage of diversification lies in the likelihood for reduced average returns across time due to a) the loss of enterprise size efficiency due to engaging in more enterprises, and/or b) if when adding enterprises, the added enterprises have lower returns...|$|R
40|$|Seasonal {{poverty in}} Bangladesh, locally known as monga, refers to {{seasonal}} deprivation of food during the pre-harvest season of Aman rice. An analysis of household {{income and expenditure}} survey data shows that average household income and consumption are much lower during monga season than in other seasons, and that seasonal income greatly influences seasonal consumption. However, lack of income and consumption smoothing is more acute in greater Rangpur, the North West region, than in other regions, causing widespread seasonal deprivation. The analysis shows that <b>agricultural</b> income <b>diversification</b> accompanied by better access to micro-credit, irrigation, education, electrification, social safety net programs, and dynamic labor markets has helped reduce seasonality in income and poverty in regions other than Rangpur in the recent past. Hence, government policies should promote income diversification through infrastructure investments and provide income transfers to the targeted poor to contain income seasonality and poverty in this impoverished part of Bangladesh.
