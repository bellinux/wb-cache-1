One {{of the goals}} of the program is to select first-generation college students, students from underprivileged areas, and/or students who have expressed a desire to work in medical specialties that are in high demand. Students entering the program must agree to work in under-served areas after completion of their medical degrees. The first group of six students entered this program during the fall 2010 semester.|$|E

In February 2006, the state Board of Pharmacy announced that the non-profit Institute of Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) would monitor all Massachusetts stores {{for the next two}} years. Later, a 2007 segment on 20/20 accused CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid among other pharmacies, of making various prescription dispensing errors. This segment aired in March 2007 and was called [...] "ABC News '20/20' Undercover Pharmacy Investigation."

2500|$|The National Association of Medical Examiners, {{concerned}} that Siebert was {{being subjected to}} a [...] "witch hunt", took {{the unusual step of}} writing the Medical Examiner Commission to offer its services to remedy the situation. The Medical Examiner Commission did not respond to the National Association of Medical Examiners (NAME) letter. On January 15, 2007, NAME followed up with a second statement of its concerns. On January 18, 2007, the Medical Examiner Commission and Dr. Siebert reached a negotiated agreement in which the Medical Examiner Commission removed all references to [...] "probation" [...] or [...] "discipline" [...] and Dr. Siebert agreed to institute a quality <b>assurance</b> <b>program</b> to look for typographical errors in reports. Dr. Siebert was not required to accept the claims of error, and is free to pursue other remedies. [...] In July 2007, Dr. Joseph Prahlow, president of the National Association of Medical Examiners noted that [...] "consensus [...] nationally, however, is that Siebert is being singled out for political purposes."

40|$|Japanese {{consumers}} are sophisticated, highly conscious of food quality and safety, {{and willing to}} pay for attributes they believe define a high-quality, safe product. A recent series of domestic and international food safety crises have elevated the importance of meat safety among Japanese consumers. The Japanese government and food industry are implementing new policies and systems intended to assure consumers that the food supply is safe and wholesome. Given that these systems tend to focus heavily on consumer <b>assurance</b> <b>programs</b> and traceability, this paper examines the demand for such programs from the perspective of Japanese meat importers, processors, and retailers. The paper discusses Japan 2 ̆ 7 s recent history of food safety crises, some of the consumer <b>assurance</b> <b>programs</b> already in use in retail outlets, the potential demand for <b>assurance</b> <b>programs</b> for imported products, and the ability of U.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore some aspects of a general {{theoretical}} model within which research on the organizational impacts of quality <b>assurance</b> <b>programs</b> in hospitals may be examined. Quality assurance is conceptualized as an organizational control mechanism, operating primarily through increased formalization of structures and specification of procedures. Organizational effectiveness is discussed from the perspective of the problem-solving theory of organizations, wherein effective organizations are those which maintain at least average performance in all four system problem areas simultaneously (goal-attainment, integration, adaptation and pattern-maintenance). It is proposed that through the realization of mutual benefits for both professionals and the bureaucracy, quality <b>assurance</b> <b>programs</b> can maximize such effective performance in hospitals...|$|R
