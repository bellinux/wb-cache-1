5|$|The next morning, Ashley {{plays on}} the beach and builds sand castles. When Ashley's drunken mother phones, {{demanding}} to know where her son is, Uncle David feigns ignorance, telling her that he himself is not in Sheppey but in Manchester. Taking Ashley to an abandoned military bunker, he injects an unknown substance into his nephew's vein as they kiss. Ashley enters an altered state of consciousness, and David guides him back to the caravan as they smoke marijuana. Once there, David gives Ashley a second injection, as they sit <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> at the shore. After dark, David places his near-catatonic nephew in a dog bed, showing him a copy of a picture book titled Is Britain Great?. He proceeds to give him a third and final injection, which he remarks will make Ashley lose consciousness and suffer organ failure. As Ashley dies, David professes that he has never loved anyone else as much before. The next morning, he goes onto the beach to place his nephew's body in a shallow grave, tearfully kissing the body goodbye before it is swept away by the sea.|$|E

25|$|The immortal souls {{that follow}} the gods most closely {{are able to}} just barely raise their chariots up to the rim <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> on reality. They see some things and miss others, {{having to deal with}} their horses; they rise and fall at varying times. Other souls, while {{straining}} to keep up, are unable to rise, and in noisy, sweaty discord they leave uninitiated, not having seen reality. Where they go after is then dependent on their own opinions, rather than the truth. Any soul that catches sight of any true thing is granted another circuit where it can see more; eventually, all souls fall back to earth. Those that have been initiated are put into varying human incarnations, depending on how much they have seen; those made into philosophers have seen the most, while kings, statesmen, doctors, prophets, poets, manual laborers, sophists, and tyrants follow respectively.|$|E

25|$|Pope John Paul II Park Reservation: The Pope John Park Reservation is {{approximately}} 66 acres in size, {{and is also}} open year-round for the residents of Dorchester. In its earlier times it {{was used as a}} landfill and also a drive-in theatre. It also serves as a barricade between the Town of Dorchester, Boston and Neponset River waterfront. This park now gives residents various resources such as; Picnic facilities, soccer fields, play areas, paths for walking, and also spacious land to plant trees and shrubs. Unfortunately, it was not always like this. In May 2015, According to James W. Dolan, Pope John Paul Park Reservation was not the same as it used to be. The State Department of Conservation and Recreation, which is responsible for the park, is not really doing its job. The plants are either dead or overgrown. There are no gardens or trees that would catch anyone's eye and also no picnic tables or grills where families could gather around and do a cookout. Dolan states that he wants to see people of the community planting vegetables and tending flower beds in the park, paddling canoes in the river, and also a grove of trees so people could sit in the shade <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> at the river.|$|E
25|$|At Lindbergh's request, {{the large}} main and forward fuel tanks {{were placed in}} the forward section of the fuselage, in front of the pilot, with the oil tank acting as a firewall. This {{arrangement}} improved the center of gravity and reduced the risk of the pilot being crushed to death between the main tank and the engine {{in the event of a}} crash. This design decision meant that there could be no front windshield, and that forward visibility would be limited to the side windows. This did not concern Lindbergh as he was used to flying in the rear cockpit of mail planes with mail bags in the front. When he wanted to see forward, he would slightly yaw the aircraft <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> the side. To provide some forward vision as a precaution against hitting ship masts, trees, or structures while flying at low altitude, a Ryan employee who had served in the submarine service installed a periscope which Lindbergh helped design. It is unclear whether the periscope was used during the flight. The instrument panel housed fuel pressure, oil pressure and temperature gauges, a clock, altimeter, tachometer, airspeed indicator, bank and turn indicator, and a liquid magnetic compass. The main compass was mounted behind Lindbergh in the cockpit, and he read it using the mirror from a women's makeup case which was mounted to the ceiling using chewing gum. Lindbergh also installed a newly developed Earth Inductor Compass made by the Pioneer Instrument Company which allowed him to more accurately navigate while taking account of the magnetic declination of the earth. Lindbergh's ultimate arrival in Ireland deviated from his flight plan by just a few miles.|$|E
500|$|Taxiing {{was easy}} {{and was only}} {{complicated}} by rain, when the pilot needed to slide back the window panel <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> to establish direction. On take off, Brown reported very little [...] "swing" [...] and the aircraft was well balanced. On landing, Brown noted that approach speed should be above 145km/h (90mph) and should be held until touchdown. This was to avoid a tendency by the He 111 to drop a wing, especially on the port side.|$|E

500|$|Another critic, Maria Tatar, {{notes that}} there is little to admire in Puss—he threatens, flatters, deceives, and steals in order to promote his master. She further observes that Puss has been viewed as a [...] "linguistic virtuoso", a {{creature}} who has mastered the arts of persuasion and rhetoric to acquire power and wealth. [...] "Puss in Boots" [...] has successfully supplanted its antecedents by Straparola and Basile and the tale has altered the shapes of many older oral trickster cat tales where they still are found. The morals Perrault attached to the tales are either at odds with the narrative, or beside the point. The first moral tells the reader that hard work and ingenuity are preferable to inherited wealth, but the moral is belied by the poor miller's son who neither works nor uses his wit to gain worldly advantage, but marries into it through trickery performed by the cat. The second moral stresses womankind's vulnerability to external appearances: fine clothes and a pleasant visage are enough to win their hearts. In an aside, Tatar suggests that if the tale has any redeeming meaning, [...] "it {{has something to do with}} inspiring respect for those domestic creatures that hunt mice <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> for their masters." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{geographer}} E. G. R. Taylor, {{reviewing the}} book for the Royal Geographical Society in 1955, wrote that Hoskins {{made the case for}} getting a strong pair of boots to learn landscape history clearly enough. Taylor compared the book to Dudley Stamp's Man and the Land, published a few months earlier in 1955, saying that Hoskins seemed to have missed it, but that given the differences in their approaches, they could be read side by side. She noted also that Hoskins did not talk about London though he covered town landscapes, and appeared unaware of urban geography. Her review ended by remarking that Hoskins [...] "views the industrial revolution with mounting horror, and the industrialists themselves are bitterly chastised as 'completely and grotesquely insensitive. No scruples weakened their lust for money; they made their money and left their muck.'" [...] She noted however that Hoskins had happily moved to [...] "a quiet spot in Oxfordshire where he can forget the 'barbaric England of the scientists, the military men and the politicians' <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> of his study window on to the past", where, she wrote, he [...] "draws for us a last tender and evocative picture of the 'gentle unravished English landscape.'" [...] Dr. Hoskins, she wrote, forgetting all the horrors, [...] "reaches back through the centuries one by one and rediscovers Eden".|$|E
500|$|Ray drags {{the case}} {{to the top of the}} stairs and meets Eddie. Gerald lays Sabrina down on the sofa, places a cushion over her face and shoots her. Gerald turns off the music as the {{doorbell}} is heard. Answering the door, Gerald sees a man (Novak) who holds up a sign reading [...] "Hello, my name is Paul. I am deaf & dumb." [...] The reverse of the sign reads [...] "Do you need any cleaning products today?" [...] Gerald heads inside and hides Sabrina's body as Paul waits. Gerald splashes his soup onto the blood and invites Paul to clean it. Ray runs down the stairs and meets Paul; he proceeds to buy rope before returning upstairs. Paul continues to clean, but sees the bullethole in the cushion, and then the suitcase being lowered outside the window. Gerald heads outside to investigate, but Eddie and Ray drop the case on his head. The burglars run past Paul <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> to see the canvas in the pool, before both being shot by Paul. Paul rings someone and says [...] "Hello, it's me. Yeah, it's done." [...] He looks to the fake painting, and says [...] "I've got it right here. Yeah, it's fine. Not a peep out of anyone." [...] He takes down the painting and walks out, as the real canvas is seen sinking in the pool.|$|E

2500|$|A coda to {{the film}} was shot that showed Midge at her apartment, {{listening}} to a radio report (voiced by San Francisco TV reporter Dave McElhatton) describing the pursuit of Gavin Elster across Europe. Midge switches the radio off when Scottie enters the room. They then share a drink <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> of the window in silence. Contrary to reports that this scene was filmed to meet foreign censorship needs, this tag ending had originally been demanded by Geoffrey Shurlock of the U.S. Production Code Administration, who had noted: [...] "It will, of course, be most important that the indication that Elster will be brought back for trial is sufficiently emphasized." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other viewers offer {{opposing}} interpretations. It {{has been}} suggested that the final scene portrays that, while Tony's life is fraught with fear and danger, which could come from anyone anywhere, and that while Tony has to constantly watch his back <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> for any emerging trouble (he keeps an eye on the diner entrance), life nevertheless goes on and the viewer simply does not get to continue seeing it. The lyrics of the closing song, seemingly telling the viewer [...] "Don't stop believin'," [...] are thought to support this, while the silent black screen space before the credits is meant to allow people to imagine and believe in their own continuations of Tony's story.|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary focus}} of the episode was on Mike and T.C.'s {{learning}} to trust <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> for each other, while many other denizens of Fenster were introduced who would have also comprised the cast of the spin-off. Mike's boss was Rita J. Sanchez (Rosana DeSoto), and his other boys, who he treated {{as if they were}} his own sons, were aspiring heavyweight boxer Lester [...] "Sugar" [...] Thompson (Martin Davis), sweet little Dash (Benji Gregory), nerdy intellectual Lyle (Gabriel Damon), who supposedly did Mike's tax forms for him; and huge, hulking Conan (B.J. Barie). When Fenster Hall did not transpire as a regular series by the time of NBC's 1985-86 upfronts, T.K. Carter then continued his role as Mike Fulton on Punky Brewster the following season, now serving as Punky's fourth grade teacher.|$|E

[...] The albums resulted from recording sessions held at the Sound of Music studios in Richmond, Virginia. They were mastered by Grammy award winner Charlie Pilzer. As with Look Out! in 2007, all songs were engineered by Bryan Hoffa, archival audio restoration specialist at the Library of Congress. The titles, bestowed by Ferd Lionel Moyse IV were inspired {{by the fact that}} these were the last two recording projects {{to come out of the}} old Sound Of Music facility, which has recently moved to a new building in Richmond.|$|E
