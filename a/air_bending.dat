50|$|In bottoming, {{the sheet}} is forced against the V {{opening in the}} bottom tool. U-shaped {{openings}} cannot be used. Space is left between the sheet and {{the bottom of the}} V opening. The optimum width of the V opening is 6 T (T stands for material thickness) for sheets about 3 mm thick, up to about 12 T for 12 mm thick sheets. The bending radius must be at least 0.8 T to 2 T for sheet steel. Larger bend radius require about the same force as larger radii in <b>air</b> <b>bending,</b> however, smaller radii require greater force—up to five times as much—than <b>air</b> <b>bending.</b> Advantages of bottoming include greater accuracy and less springback. A disadvantage is that a different tool set is needed for each bend angle, sheet thickness, and material. In general, <b>air</b> <b>bending</b> is the preferred technique.|$|E
50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>bending</b> {{does not}} require the bottom tool to have the same radius as the punch. Bend radius is {{determined}} by material elasticity rather than tool shape.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} problems in <b>air</b> vee <b>bending</b> process is springback compensation to satisfy dimensional tolerances. Influence of tool geometry, bending angle and sheet thickness on springback in <b>air</b> vee <b>bending</b> was investigated in this paper. In order to evaluate influence of sheet material on springback, S 355 MC and DD 13 steels were used in bending experiments. Experimental data showed that springback intensity of a material mostly depends on die width followed by sheet thickness and punch radius for all values of bending angles...|$|R

50|$|The {{flexibility}} and relatively low tonnage required by <b>air</b> <b>bending</b> {{are helping to}} make it a popular choice. Quality problems associated with this method are countered by angle-measuring systems, clamps and crowning systems adjustable along the x and y axes, and wear-resistant tools.|$|E
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of <b>air</b> <b>bending</b> is that, because the sheet does not stay in full {{contact with the}} dies, {{it is not as}} precise as some other methods, and stroke depth must be kept very accurate. Variations in the thickness of the material and wear on the tools can result in defects in parts produced.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the newer}} bottom tools are adjustable, so, by using a single set of top and bottom tools and varying press-stroke depth, {{different}} profiles and products can be produced. Different materials and thicknesses can be bent in varying bend angles, adding the advantage of flexibility to <b>air</b> <b>bending.</b> There are also fewer tool changes, thus, higher productivity.|$|E

40|$|Springback is {{a serious}} problem in the <b>air</b> vee <b>bending</b> process because of its inconsistency. An on-line tool to control {{springback}} is more reliable than an analytical model which {{might not be able to}} control the stroke of the machine in real-time. Therefore, one might resort to adaptive control or use an artificial neural network (ANN) trainer, either using experimental data or analytical predictions (or both), and use it for real-time control of the machine tool. The inconsistency in springback is then reduced to within acceptable limits. Adaptive control would need several strokes to complete the job, but it is envisaged that the job could be completed in a single stroke with the ANN. The present paper discusses the development of an ANN which can be used to train and later to predict the springback, as well as the punch travel, to achieve the desired angle in a single stroke in an <b>air</b> vee <b>bending</b> process...|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} basic types of bending on a press brake, each {{is defined by}} the {{relationship}} of the end tool position to the thickness of the material. These three are <b>Air</b> <b>Bending,</b> Bottoming and Coining. The configuration of the tools for these three types of bending are nearly identical. A die with a long rail form tool with a radiused tip that locates the inside profile of the bend is called a punch. Punches are usually attached to the ram of the machine by clamps and move to produce the bending force. A die with a long rail form tool that has concave or V shaped lengthwise channel that locate the outside profile of the form is called a die. Dies are usually stationary and located under the material on the bed of the machine. Note that some locations do not differentiate between the two different kinds of dies (punches and dies.) The other types of bending listed use specially designed tools or machines to perform the work.|$|E
50|$|Making {{his debut}} in Book Three: Change, Zuko is {{revealed}} {{to have been}} working with the Order of the White Lotus to keep major threats in check while Korra was still in training. Most notably, he worked alongside Sokka, Tenzin (Aang's younger son), and Korra's father Tonraq to thwart an attempt by the criminal Zaheer and his Red Lotus followers to kidnap Korra when she was a child. Fourteen years later, Zuko learnt of Zaheer's new <b>air</b> <b>bending</b> skills and subsequent escape. He enlists Korra's father Tonraq and her cousins, Desna and Eska, to keep the last of Zaheer's allies from being freed, but their efforts were unsuccessful. When Zaheer fatally suffocated Earth Queen Hou-Ting and gave an ultimatum to Korra, Zuko immediately returned to the Fire Nation, fearing the anarchists would target his daughter. Zuko briefly councils Korra regarding the situation before he departs, and is surprised to learn that the Avatar has spoken to his long-deceased uncle in the Spirit World. When Zaheer is defeated in the season finale, Zuko attends Jinora's ceremony as airbending master, and expresses concerns about the lingering threat of the Red Lotus.|$|E
