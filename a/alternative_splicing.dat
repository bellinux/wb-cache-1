5|$|PRKACA {{is found}} on {{chromosome}} 19 in humans. There are two well-described transcripts of this gene, arising from <b>alternative</b> <b>splicing</b> events. The most common form, called Cα1, is expressed throughout human tissue. Another transcript, called Cα2, is found primarily in sperm cells and differs from Cα1 {{only in the}} first 15 amino acids.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{polyadenylation}} begins as the transcription {{of a gene}} terminates. The 3'-most segment of the newly made pre-mRNA is first cleaved off {{by a set of}} proteins; these proteins then synthesize the poly(A) tail at the RNA's 3' end. In some genes these proteins add a poly(A) tail at one of several possible sites. Therefore, polyadenylation can produce more than one transcript from a single gene (alternative polyadenylation), similar to <b>alternative</b> <b>splicing.</b>|$|E
5|$|In humans, APOA5 is {{expressed}} {{almost exclusively in}} the liver tissue; some minor expressions have also been detected in the small intestine. Nothing {{is known about the}} existence of the potential <b>alternative</b> <b>splicing</b> variants of this gene. In comparison with other apolipoproteins, plasma concentration of APOA5 is very low (less than 1 μg/mL). This suggests that it has more catalytic than structural functions, since there is less than one APOA5 molecule per one lipoprotein particle. APOA5 is associated predominantly with TG-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons and VLDL) and has also been detected on HDL particles.|$|E

5|$|Early work in {{molecular}} genetics suggested {{the concept that}} one gene makes one protein. This concept (originally called the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis) emerged from an influential 1941 paper by George Beadle and Edward Tatum on experiments with mutants of the fungus Neurospora crassa. Norman Horowitz, an early colleague on the Neurospora research, reminisced in 2004 that “these experiments founded the science of what Beadle and Tatum called biochemical genetics. In actuality they {{proved to be the}} opening gun in what became {{molecular genetics}} and all the developments that have followed from that.” The one gene-one protein concept has been refined since the discovery of genes that can encode multiple proteins by <b>alternative</b> <b>splicing</b> and coding sequences split in short section across the genome whose mRNAs are concatenated by trans-splicing.|$|E
5|$|In prokaryotes, {{transcription}} {{occurs in}} the cytoplasm; for very long transcripts, translation may begin at the 5'end of the RNA while the 3'end is still being transcribed. In eukaryotes, transcription {{occurs in the}} nucleus, where the cell's DNA is stored. The RNA molecule produced by the polymerase {{is known as the}} primary transcript and undergoes post-transcriptional modifications before being exported to the cytoplasm for translation. One of the modifications performed is the splicing of introns which are sequences in the transcribed region that do not encode protein. <b>Alternative</b> <b>splicing</b> mechanisms can result in mature transcripts from the same gene having different sequences and thus coding for different proteins. This is a major form of regulation in eukaryotic cells and also occurs in some prokaryotes.|$|E
5|$|RNA splicing, {{carried out}} by a complex called the spliceosome, is {{the process by which}} introns, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the {{remaining}} exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule. This process normally occurs after 5' capping and 3' polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons. Many pre-mRNAs, including those encoding antibodies, can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different protein sequences. This process is known as <b>alternative</b> <b>splicing,</b> and allows production of a large variety of proteins from a limited amount of DNA.|$|E
50|$|This gene {{is one of}} two human homologs of Drosophila bicaudal-D. It {{has been}} implicated in COPI-independent {{membrane}} transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum.

Other <b>alternative</b> <b>splice</b> variants that encode different protein isoforms have been described but their full-length nature has not been determined.|$|R
40|$|We {{established}} {{a database of}} <b>alternative</b> <b>splice</b> forms (ASforms) for nine eukaryotic organisms. ASforms are de®ned by comparing high-scoring ESTs with mRNA sequences using BLAST, taking known exon±intron information (from the Ensembl database). Filtering programs compare the ends of each aligned sequence pair for deletions or insertions in the EST sequence, which indicate the existence of <b>alternative</b> <b>splice</b> forms {{with respect to the}} exon±intron boundaries. Moreover, we de®ned the <b>alternative</b> <b>splice</b> pro®le of each human sequence. It indicates the number of alternatively spliced ESTs (NAE), the number of constitutively spliced ESTs (NCE) as well as the number of <b>alternative</b> <b>splice</b> sites (NSS) per mRNA. NAE and NCE correspond to the EST coverage and {{can be used as a}} quality indicator for the predicted <b>alternative</b> <b>splice</b> variants. The NSS value speci®es the splice propensity of a gene. Additionally, the tissue type information of all ESTs was included. This allows (i) restriction of the search to certain tissues and (ii) calculation of the tissue-NAEs, tissue-NCEs and tissue-NSS. These scores are suitable for the estimation of tissue speci®city of certain ASforms. Furthermore, the developmental stage and disease information of the ESTs is available.

5|$|Transcription is {{the process}} by which the {{information}} contained in a section of DNA is replicated {{in the form of a}} newly assembled piece of messenger RNA (mRNA). Enzymes facilitating the process include RNA polymerase and transcription factors. In eukaryotic cells the primary transcript is pre-mRNA. Pre-mRNA must be processed for translation to proceed. Processing includes the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail to the pre-mRNA chain, followed by splicing. <b>Alternative</b> <b>splicing</b> occurs when appropriate, increasing the diversity of the proteins that any single mRNA can produce. The product of the entire transcription process (that began with the production of the pre-mRNA chain) is a mature mRNA chain.|$|E
5|$|Vampire bats use {{infrared}} radiation to locate blood hotspots on their prey. A recent study {{has shown that}} common vampire bats tune a TRP-channel that is already heat-sensitive, TRPV1, by lowering its thermal activation threshold to about 30°C. This is achieved through <b>alternative</b> <b>splicing</b> of TRPV1 transcripts to produce a channel with a truncated carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain. These splicing events occur exclusively in trigeminal ganglia, and not in dorsal root ganglia, thereby maintaining a role for TRPV1 as a detector of noxious heat in somatic afferents. The only other vertebrates capable of detecting {{infrared radiation}} are boas, pythons and pit vipers, {{all of which have}} pit organs.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{duplication}} is not {{the only}} way that venom has become more diverse. There have been instances of new venom proteins generated by <b>alternative</b> <b>splicing.</b> The Elapid snake Bungarus fasciatus, for example, possesses a gene that is alternatively spliced to yield both a venom component and a physiological protein. Further diversification may have occurred by gene loss of specific venom components. For instance, the rattlesnake ancestor is believed to have had genes for neurotoxic PLA2 toxins, which are absent in modern non-neurotoxic Crotalus species. The various recruitment events had resulted in snake venom evolving into a very complex mixture of proteins. The venom of rattlesnakes, for example, includes nearly 40 different proteins from different protein families, and other snake venoms have been found to contain more than 100 distinct proteins. The composition of this mixture has been shown to vary geographically, and to be related to the prey species available in a certain region. Snake venom has generally evolved very quickly, with changes occurring faster in the venom than in the rest of the organism.|$|E
40|$|The {{finding that}} {{eukaryotic}} gene structures are extremely complex prompted {{the development of}} new experimental techniques for the accurate measurement of transcription start site usage and of the expression of <b>alternative</b> <b>splice</b> forms. On the computational side, analyses of large databases of splice variants revealed differences in the length, motif composition and selection pressure between constitutive and alternatively spliced exons. Such features are being incorporated into novel computational tools for gene structure prediction. The result of these investigations is a continuously improving catalogue of <b>alternative</b> <b>splice</b> forms. How the expression of these <b>alternative</b> <b>splice</b> forms is regulated remains one of the major open questions...|$|R

5|$|The KIT gene encodes {{a protein}} called steel factor receptor, which is {{critical}} to the differentiation of stem cells into blood cells, sperm cells, and pigment cells. A process called <b>alternative</b> <b>splicing,</b> which uses the information encoded in the KIT gene to make slightly different proteins (isoforms) for use in different circumstances, may impact whether a mutation on KIT affects blood cells, sperm cells, or pigment cells. Steel factor receptor interacts chemically with steel factor or stem cell factor to relay chemical messages. These messages are used during embryonic development to signal the migration of early melanocytes (pigment cells) from the neural crest tissue to their eventual destinations in the dermal layer. The neural crest is a transient tissue in the embryo that lies along the dorsal line. Melanocytes migrate along the dorsal line to a number of specific sites: near the eye, near the ear, and the top of the head; six sites along each side of the body, and a few along the tail. At these sites, the cells undergo a few rounds of replication and differentiation, and then migrate down and around the body from the dorsal aspect towards the ventral aspect and the limb buds.|$|E

25|$|Evidence {{supporting}} this claim identified that decreased m6A {{levels in the}} transcriptome lead to significantly reduced HNRNPC binding, thus <b>alternative</b> <b>splicing</b> is co-regulated by methylation and HNRNPC binding activity. However, the m6A modification does not directly cause protein binding. Rather, it alters the loop structure to regulate gene expression by acting as a switch that exposes the HNRNPC region. It is essentially a two-step, co-regulatory mechanism prevalent in biochemistry in controlling <b>alternative</b> <b>splicing.</b> Note that demethylase enzyme can indeed “erase” the methyl group, thus inhibiting <b>alternative</b> <b>splicing</b> which is the reverse of the two-step regulation mechanism.|$|E

25|$|<b>Alternative</b> <b>splicing</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} components that show functional complexity of genome. Modified splicing has significant effect on the phenotype that is relevance to disease or drug metabolism. A change in splicing can be caused by modifying any of the components of the splicing machinery such as splice sites or splice enhancers or silencers. Modification in the <b>alternative</b> <b>splicing</b> site can lead to a different protein form which will show a different function. Humans use an estimated 100,000 different proteins or more, so some genes must be capable of coding for a lot more than just one protein. <b>Alternative</b> <b>splicing</b> occurs more frequently than was previously thought and can be hard to control; genes may produce tens of thousands of different transcripts, necessitating a new gene model for each alternative splice.|$|E

25|$|<b>Alternative</b> <b>splicing,</b> or {{differential}} splicing, is a regulated process during {{gene expression}} {{that results in}} a single gene coding for multiple proteins. In this process, particular exons of a gene may be included within or excluded from the final, processed messenger RNA (mRNA) produced from that gene. Consequently, the proteins translated from alternatively spliced mRNAs will contain differences in their amino acid sequence and, often, in their biological functions (see Figure). Notably, <b>alternative</b> <b>splicing</b> allows the human genome to direct the synthesis of many more proteins than would be expected from its 20,000 protein-coding genes.|$|E

Another study, however, proposed that these results were an artifact of the different numbers of ESTs available for the various organisms.
