5|$|I will confess {{up front}} that I love Anonymous, {{but not because}} I think they're the heroes. Like Alan Moore's {{character}} V who inspired Anonymous to adopt the Guy Fawkes mask as an icon and fashion item, you're never quite sure if Anonymous is the hero or antihero. The trickster is attracted to change {{and the need for}} change, and that's where Anonymous goes.

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of an inning during which runs are scored after an error or passed ball, the official scorer attempts to recreate {{the events of the}} inning without the errors or passed balls. If in the official scorer's opinion a run would not have scored without the defensive lapses, then the run is unearned. If the scorer believes that a run would have scored anyway, the run is earned and charged to the pitcher. In one basic example, if the first batter reaches by an error, the second batter hits a home run, and the next three batters strike out, then one of the two runs which were scored are unearned. There <b>are</b> <b>rules</b> and restrictions which govern this general guideline.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} chess (also {{known as the}} laws of chess) <b>are</b> <b>rules</b> {{governing}} the {{play of the game}} of chess. While the exact origins of chess are unclear, modern rules first took form during the Middle Ages. The rules continued to be slightly modified until the early 19th century, when they reached essentially their current form. The rules also varied somewhat from place to place. Today, the standard rules are set by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), the international governing body for chess. Slight modifications are made by some national organizations for their own purposes. There are variations of the rules for fast chess, correspondence chess, online chess, and Chess960.|$|E

25|$|For {{refutation}} tableaux, {{the objective}} is to show that the negation of a formula cannot be satisfied.

Quantifiers are instantiated. If any branch of a tableau leads to an evident contradiction, the branch closes.

25|$|In Korea, {{unlike in}} China, Japan and Vietnam, the rice or soup bowl is not {{lifted from the}} table when eating from it.

There <b>are</b> <b>rules</b> which reflect the decorum of sharing {{communal}} side dishes; rules include not picking through the dishes for certain items while leaving others, and the spoon used should be clean, because usually diners put their spoons in the same serving bowl on the table. Diners should also cover their mouths when using a toothpick after the meal.|$|E

25|$|One theory used to {{describe}} pronominal binding is to use index marking rules to determine possible bindings. Index marking rules <b>are</b> <b>rules</b> used to determine which parts of a sentence carry the same reference. Each element in a sentence is given an index, which is a unique identifier of that element. A set of rules can then be applied to modify the index of one element {{to be the same}} as the index of another. Those two elements will then share the same index, and so will refer to the same thing. This indexing theory was used as a way {{to describe}} pronominal binding by Noam Chomsky, and expanded upon by James Higginbotham. The theory holds that the binding of pronouns consists of three main parts.|$|E
25|$|First, {{citizens}} must {{support the}} Government's policy, thus entailing objective congruence between the promoter of moral suasion {{and the target}} whose behaviour should be changed. That support emanates from such factors that determine compliance as; potential illegal gain; severity and certainty of sanctions; individual's moral development and their standards of personal morality; individual's perceptions of how just and moral <b>are</b> <b>rules</b> being enforced; and social environmental influences. For example, during the hyper-inflation in Zimbabwe, most business people were accepting foreign currency as a medium of exchange {{in violation of the}} country's Exchange Control rules and regulations despite calls by the Central Bank to persuade stakeholders to accept only the local currency as medium of exchange. The business community felt that the rules being enforced through moral suasion were not just and moral. Thus in cases where factors that determine compliance are in line with Government's objectives, the cost of non-compliance increases as behaviours which are contrary to social moral values suffer social reputation if members know about the non compliance.|$|E
25|$|During general play, players may {{position}} themselves {{anywhere on the}} field and use any part of their bodies to move the ball. The primary methods are kicking, handballing and running with the ball. There <b>are</b> <b>rules</b> on how the ball can be handled: for example, players running with the ball must intermittently bounce or touch it on the ground. Throwing the ball is not allowed and players must not get caught holding the ball. A distinctive feature of the game is the mark, where players anywhere on the field who catch a ball from a kick (with specific conditions) are awarded possession. Possession of the ball is in dispute at all times except when a free kick or mark is paid. Players can tackle using their hands or use their whole body to obstruct opponents. Dangerous physical contact (such as pushing an opponent in the back), interference when marking and deliberately slowing the play are discouraged with free kicks, distance penalties or suspension for a certain number of matches, depending on the seriousness of the infringement. The game features frequent physical contests, spectacular marking, fast movement of both players and the ball and high scoring.|$|E

500|$|Murphy has {{clashed with}} Stephen Maguire, {{another of the}} 2000 Young Players of Distinction, on several occasions. At the start of their 2004 Grand Prix match, there was an {{incident}} that resulted in Maguire being docked the opening frame. After they had shaken hands {{at the outset of}} the first frame, Maguire asked referee Johan Oomen for permission to leave the arena and retrieve his chalk, which he had forgotten. While Maguire was away, the referee and Murphy spoke before tournament director Mike Ganley arrived on the scene and docked Maguire a frame for technically not being ready to start at the scheduled time, which angered and surprised Maguire. Murphy refutes that the docking of the frame was down to him speaking to the referee. Maguire won the match 5–2 and later commented: [...] "Rules <b>are</b> <b>rules</b> but I've never heard of anything like that happening before".|$|E
500|$|Another {{view is that}} Section 3 {{provides}} a much strengthened basis {{for the sort of}} [...] "weak review" [...] the scope of which carefully determined between courts on one hand and parliament on the other [...] in a statutory form. There have been at least three criticisms put forward: firstly that the impossibility of implied repeal goes against some formulations of parliamentary sovereignty that require that no parliament can bind a future parliament. Secondly, whether section 3 interpretations follow parliamentary intent is questionable; thirdly, if it does allow interpretations contrary to intent, section 3 may render section 4 necessary. However, judicial powers are probably not unconstrained. The analysis of what the courts can and cannot do would also provide the answer the third criticism, depending on the viewpoint. Whilst the scope of section 3 has been criticised for being vague, and leading therefore more easily to the imposition of the judiciary on the legal domain of parliament, this viewpoint is controversial: they do not seem to have yet so encroached and there <b>are</b> <b>rules</b> emerging about the application of section 3.|$|E
500|$|The first DLC package, Strategic Options, added {{three new}} {{multiplayer}} modes. [...] "Keepaway" [...] {{is similar to}} capture the flag; in it, players try to capture and hold Forerunner units. In [...] "Tug-of-war", players earn points by fielding large armies and destroying enemy units. In [...] "Reinforcement", players receive units as reinforcements, rather than training them at bases. The amount of available resources and reactors determines which types of units are deployed and the upgrades they can earn. Strategic Options was released on May 19, 2009, after a patch that addressed software bugs and game balance issues. The update garnered criticism for its small size (2megabytes) and high price (800Microsoft Points). Pottinger responded on the Halo Wars forums that the game modes were small downloads [...] "because they <b>are</b> <b>rules.</b> There is some new content, but it's obviously {{a different type of}} content compared to a map." [...] Robot released a second DLC package on July 21, 2009. The DLC, dubbed [...] "Historic Battles", contains four additional maps and four new Xbox Live achievements.|$|E
