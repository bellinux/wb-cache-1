Two former Coldstream Guards were hired to stand in front of news reporters when they visited the set, to block possible photographs of the filming.

500|$|The storyline {{was created}} in spring 2009 during a story conference, where {{executive}} producer Diederick Santer, storyliner Dominic Treadwell-Collins, series consultant and lead writer Simon Ashdown, series producer Lorraine Newman, script producer Sharon Batten, and Controller of BBC Drama Production John Yorke were considering what {{to do for the}} Christmas Day 2009 and 25th anniversary episodes. They discussed the character Archie Mitchell and how everyone hated him, and decided on a storyline with characters' hatred and anger towards Archie building up before Christmas, with a peak on Christmas Day when he is killed and another for the reveal on the 19 February 2010 anniversary. They decided to keep the killer's identity a secret within the small group and decided to reveal it during a live episode so that the secret could be kept for as long as possible, and managed the story on <b>a</b> <b>need-to-know</b> basis. The live episode's director, Clive Arnold, became the seventh person to discover the identity of the murderer. They went through the characters to decide who would create a [...] "shiver" [...] moment, and decided against Janine, even though she could have done it, because she has killed before. The killer was going to be Archie's wife Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), until producers discovered Windsor had planned to leave the show, so they decided on Stacey. Although scripts initially diverted attention away from Stacey, Santer realised that drawing attention away from her too much might make it more apparent.|$|E

2500|$|Porter {{began his}} {{engineering}} career in 1954 at WLAC-TV in Nashville, Tennessee, where {{he wished to}} be a cameraman—nobody wanted to mix sound, though, and that job was assigned to him, {{the guy with the}} least seniority. He mixed up to four microphones for television broadcast for $92 per week, equivalent to $ today. At nearby RCA Records in 1959, the chief engineer was transferred after angering Chet Atkins, and Porter applied for the position. He was told by an RCA executive from New York that the job would ruin his marriage, but Porter said [...] "I can handle that"—he was hired at $148 per week, and given two weeks to learn all the equipment and how to mix up to 12 microphones for music recordings. Shortly after starting with RCA on March 31, 1959, Porter mixed the single [...] "Lonesome Old House" [...] for Don Gibson; it was a crossover success in both the country music and the pop music charts, and Porter began to be requested by name. In June 1959, he mixed [...] "The Three Bells" [...] for the Browns, with Atkins producing and Anita Kerr arranging. While editing the master to be sent to New York for pressing, Porter accidentally hit the wrong controls on the tape recorder and stretched the tape {{at the beginning of the}} song, distorting the pitch. Without telling anyone, he spliced a different take with a good intro onto the beginning, and sent that version instead. Four decades later, Porter recalled his quick fix: [...] "this was <b>a</b> <b>need-to-know</b> situation and I figured nobody needed to know. I had been in the business three months or something like that. You're not a good engineer until you destroy a master and hopefully live to talk about it." [...] In July, the song went to number one on the U.S. country and pop charts, and Porter's reputation rose.|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, a {{security}} clearance is an official determination {{that an individual}} may access information classified by the United States Government. Security clearances are hierarchical; each level grants the holder access to information in that level and the levels below it. The clearance process requires a background investigation and the signing of a nondisclosure agreement. Access to any particular piece of information requires [...] "need-to-know." [...] In some cases, this requirement is only nominal, as some classified information is widely published on secure networks. In other cases, there is <b>a</b> formal <b>need-to-know</b> determination.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{exploratory}} paper is to theorise and examine {{gender differences in the}} impact of financial capital on Chinese firms' growth, and investigate the role of guanxi (connections and networks) in the process of obtaining finance. Design/methodology/approach: A structured questionnaire is used to collect comprehensive financial data from 18 women to 69 men, which is analysed empirically. Findings: Women appear to be no more disadvantaged from obtaining finance than men in China and in some respects appear to be in a better position. Both women- and men-led firms are significantly stronger in relation to having access to enough finance to grow than at the start-up phase. A majority of participants in this study used guanxi to access finance. Furthermore, the paper finds that guanxi is used equally by men and women, and that guanxi-sourced finance comprised a significant proportion of the overall capital obtained. Research limitations/implications: One major limitation of the study is that, of the 87 questionnaires returned, 21 per cent are women and 79 per cent are men and, although the findings are not representative or generalisable, the results do suggest a number of possible avenues for future research. Originality/value: The paper has illuminated the under-explored area of the financing of growth in women-led firms in China. This research agenda is particularly important because small- and medium-sized enterprise finance in China is <b>a</b> key <b>need-to-know</b> area, there is a paucity of specific research on financing women entrepreneurs in China and of the phenomenal rise of women's entrepreneurship in China. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to use {{univariate}} statistical analysis to investigate barriers to raising bank finance faced by UK small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), specifically the impact of personal characteristics (ethnicity, gender and education). Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model was developed and the results of a telephone survey of 400 SMEs conducted (before the "credit crunch") by the Barclays Bank small business research team were analysed. The survey was based on a large stratified random sample drawn from the Bank's entire SME population. Findings: It was found that education made little difference to sources of finance, except that those educated to A-level more frequently used friends and family and remortgaged their homes. However, graduates had the least difficulties raising finance. Though statistically insignificant, women respondents found it easier to raise finance than men. The survey confirmed that - and this finding was statistically significant - ethnic minority businesses, particularly black owner-managers, had the greatest problem raising finance and hence relied upon "bootstrapping" as a financing strategy. Practical implications: The study makes an important contribution to filling a research gap, given the critical need of policy-makers to understand differentials between different types of owner-managers.
