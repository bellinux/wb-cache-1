Although marketed towards the [...] "prosumer" [...] user, the 5/A2/A2e were popular among professional photographers. The camera was {{powered by a}} 6 volt lithium 2CR5 battery, or, with the optional Canon BP-5 Battery Pack, could be powered by D batteries attached to the belt of the user. The Canon VG-10 Vertical Grip added a shutter release, control wheel, <b>AE</b> <b>Lock</b> button and Focus Point Selection button {{to the bottom of}} the camera for portrait orientation use, but did not add AA batteries as a power source.|$|E

5000|$|The R9 was an {{evolutionary}} step from the R8 and appears superficially very similar; {{enough so that}} some have opined {{that it should have}} been simply a Mark II of the R8, or in Leica nomenclature, an [...] "R8.2".2 The silver top-plate color available on the R8 was replaced by an 'Anthracite' color on the R9; black remained available. Another external change was the addition of an LCD frame counter on the top plate between the wind lever and the shutter-speed dial. The mode selector dial gained a lock, after many R8 user complaints that it was too easily moved from the desired setting when handling the camera. The rear LCD display gained a backlight so it could be viewed in dim lighting. The mass of the R9 was reduced by 100g (to 790g) from the R8, achieved by switching to a magnesium casting for the top plate (formerly zinc alloy) and substituting aluminum for steel at the bottom plate's frame. Electronic changes included the ability to tune the sensitivity of matrix metering in steps of 0.1 EV independently of the other metering modes, and several improvements to the flash support. Metz's HSS (High Speed Sync) flash mode was now supported, allowing fill flash at shutter speeds greater than the X-sync speed by the use of many repeated small flashes of the electronic flashgun. This mode could be used from 1/360 to the camera's shortest 1/8000 of a second shutter speed. Also improved was the use of fill-flash at slower shutter speeds and wider apertures, by enabling lower-power illumination modes on modern Metz equipment. The manual flash exposure compensation ability in Program mode was improved, and <b>AE</b> <b>lock</b> was now possible in all automated modes.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>lock</b> is <b>a</b> system object {{associated}} with a shared resource such as a data item of an elementary type, a row in a database, or a page of memory. In <b>a</b> database, <b>a</b> <b>lock</b> on <b>a</b> database object (<b>a</b> data-access <b>lock)</b> {{may need to be}} acquired by a transaction before accessing the object. Correct use of locks prevents undesired, incorrect or inconsistent operations on shared resources by other concurrent transactions. When a database object with <b>an</b> existing <b>lock</b> acquired by one transaction needs to be accessed by another transaction, the existing lock for the object and the type of the intended access are checked by the system. If the existing lock type does not allow this specific attempted concurrent access type, the transaction attempting access is blocked (according to a predefined agreement/scheme). In practice, <b>a</b> <b>lock</b> on <b>an</b> object does not directly block a transaction's operation upon the object, but rather blocks that transaction from acquiring another lock on the same object, needed to be held/owned by the transaction before performing this operation. Thus, with <b>a</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism, needed operation blocking is controlled by <b>a</b> proper <b>lock</b> blocking scheme, which indicates which lock type blocks which lock type.|$|R
