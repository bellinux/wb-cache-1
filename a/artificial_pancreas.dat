40|$|The <b>artificial</b> {{endocrine}} <b>pancreas</b> is a {{feedback control}} instrument that regulates insulin delivery on a minute-by-minute basis according to measured blood glucose levels. Only {{one type of}} bedside-type <b>artificial</b> endocrine <b>pancreas</b> is now available in Japan: STG- 22 (Nikkiso Co. Ltd., Japan). In the insulin infusion algorithm, insulin is infused {{on the basis of}} its proportional and derivative actions, to blood glucose concentrations with a constant time delay. The bedside-type <b>artificial</b> endocrine <b>pancreas</b> has been proven to be useful not only as a therapeutic tool for diabetes mellitus, but also as an elegant research tool for investigating the pathophysiology of the disease, by using the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp technique. The wearable type of closed-loop system has been developed recently. The breakthrough is the establishment of a needle-type glucose sensor. The development of closed-loop glycemic control systems that enable long-term physiological regulation has focused on implantable devices.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the stepwise development {{and testing of}} the components of a novel <b>artificial</b> endocrine <b>pancreas,</b> consisting of a continuous glucose monitor, an insulin infusion device and a control algorithm. The starting point was the belief that current approaches to the challenges posed by creating an <b>artificial</b> endocrine <b>pancreas</b> do not work, and we identified some of the biological mechanisms that can explain this lack of success. We further established a set of research questions with the overall goal of constructing a working <b>artificial</b> endocrine <b>pancreas.</b> The first paper {{describes the}} in vivo (pig model) testing of a prototype of a new intravascular continuous glucose monitor, the IvS- 1. The study determined that the monitor was able to produce readings with a reasonably fast response time that highly agreed with simultaneously drawn blood samples. The second study examined the pharmacological properties of intravenous insulin boluses, and estimated the time delays from insulin administration until changes in the blood glucose level. The third study demonstrated that blood glucose levels were the same in the arterial and venous systems, even at times of great circulatory stress. The fourth study relied on our accumulated knowledge to enable us to construct an <b>artificial</b> endocrine <b>pancreas</b> using the IvS- 1 and a novel insulin regulatory algorithm based on insulin boluses. We then regulated the blood glucose level in diabetic pigs in a proof-of-concept study. The thesis concludes by answering the research questions, and asserts that the construction of an <b>artificial</b> endocrine <b>pancreas</b> is possible from a biological standpoint However, there are several serious technological challenges that have to be overcome {{in order to make a}} stable system for in-hospital – and later outpatient – use.

40|$|Abstract. We {{continue}} our attempt of modeling the open-loop control of glucose level by impulsive insulin injections. Several time delays {{exist in the}} system. The delays include the time needed for insulin from injection depot to transport to the interstitial compartment, {{the time for the}} slow inhibition of the hepatic glucose production (HGP), and the time for insulin secretion caused by the elevated glucose concentration level from remaining functional pancreatic β-cells. None of them are negligible. The model proposed in this paper incorporates these time delays. Our analytical studies show that all solutions are permanent, a periodic solution exists, and for the case of type 1 diabetes mellitus the periodic solution is unique and globally asymptotically stable. Numerically {{it has been shown that}} moderate time delays in the system are beneficial in lowering blood sugar level rather than harmful. In contrast, these time delays cause that the open-loop control takes a longer time to lower glucose concentration level. Our studies also elucidate the noticeable inhibitory effect on HGP by the remaining functional β-cells. Similarly to our previous work, we demonstrated that a smaller dose with higher delivery frequency has a better effect on continuous subcutaneous insulin injection administration. We expect that our findings are helpful for clinical therapies.

25|$|While insulin {{replacement}} is appreciated as a life saving therapy, its {{practical use}} in controlling blood glucose levels sufficiently {{to avoid the}} long-term complications associated with hyperglycemia is not ideal.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{perioperative}} hyperglycemia is the main cause of infectious complications after surgery. To improve perioperative glycemic control, we wish to highlight and comment on an interesting paper published recently by the Annals of Surgery entitled: &#x 201 C;Early postoperative hyperglycemia is associated with postoperative complications after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) &#x 201 D; by Eshuis et al. The authors concluded that early postoperative glucose levels more than 140 mg/dL was significantly associated with complications after PD. Since we recommend that perioperative tight glycemic control (TGC) is an effective method to prevent postoperative complications including surgical site infection after distal, proximal, and total pancreatic resection, we support strongly this conclusion drawn in this article. However, if early postoperative glucose control in patients undergoing PD was administrated by conventional method such as sliding scale approach as described in this article, it is difficult to maintain TGC. Therefore, we introduce a novel perioperative glycemic control using an <b>artificial</b> endocrine <b>pancreas</b> against pancreatogenic diabetes after pancreatic resection including PD...|$|R
30|$|Hypoglycemia mostly {{originates}} from diabetic therapy, including insulin and its secretagogues. Hypoglycemia {{can also}} occur due to inanition, hepatic disorders, hormone deficiencies, antibodies to insulin or its receptor, performance of gastric bypass, and tumors (i.e., tumor-induced hypoglycemia [TIH]) [1]. The {{most common cause}} of TIH is insulinoma, an insulin-hypersecreting tumor of pancreatic islet beta cells [2]. Non-islet cell tumors also secrete excess insulin or insulin-like hormones, resulting in non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH). The main etiology of NICTH is the release of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF 2) [2]. Surgical resection is the most curative therapy for NICTH, although intraoperative glycemic control is quite challenging for anesthesiologists because of intense fluctuation of the blood glucose level. An <b>artificial</b> endocrine <b>pancreas</b> (AP) is capable of continuous measurement of the blood glucose level with automatic adjustment of the insulin or glucose infusion rate to achieve stable glycemic control. Its efficacy has been reported in patients with insulinoma [3], although its benefits in patients with NICTH with IGF 2 elevation remain unclear. We herein report a case involving resection of an IGF 2 -producing pleural solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) using an AP.|$|R

40|$|Controlling meal-related glucose {{excursions}} {{continues to}} be a therapeutic challenge in diabetes mellitus. Mechanistic reasons for this need to be understood better to develop appropriate therapies. To investigate delayed gastric emptying effects on postprandial glucose turnover, insulin sensitivity, and β-cell responsivity and function, as a feasibility study prior to studying patients with type 1 diabetes, we used the triple tracer technique C-peptide and oral minimal model approach in healthy subjects. A single dose of 30 μg of pramlintide administered {{at the start of a}} mixed meal was used to delay gastric emptying rates. With delayed gastric emptying rates, peak rate of meal glucose appearance was delayed, and rate of endogenous glucose production (EGP) was lower. C-peptide and oral minimal models enabled the assessments of β-cell function, insulin sensitivity, and β-cell responsivity simultaneously. Delayed gastric emptying induced by pramlintide improved total insulin sensitivity and decreased total β-cell responsivity. However, β-cell function as measured by total disposition index did not change. The improved whole body insulin sensitivity coupled with lower rate of appearance of EGP with delayed gastric emptying provides experimental proof of the importance of evaluating pramlintide in <b>artificial</b> endocrine <b>pancreas</b> approaches to reduce postprandial blood glucose variability in patients with type 1 diabetes...|$|R

The remaining five subjects received glucose (4. 0 mg/kg X min), amino acid (0. 5 mg/kg X min), and lipid emulsion (0. 6 mg/kg X min). Plasma glucose concentration was kept constant over 24 hours. However, both insulin requirement (111 +/- 15 v 70 +/- 2 mU/kg X h) and plasma insulin level (99 +/- 15 v 30 +/- 7 microU/mL; P less than. 01) were higher during combined TPN. Blood lactate concentration was higher during glucose infusion (P less than. 05). No difference was found in blood concentrations of pyruvate, alanine, and ketone bodies. Both glycerol and FFA were higher during combined TPN. The ratio between glucose infusion rate and the average plasma insulin level was calculated as an index of insulin-mediated glucose metabolism; G/I X 100 was markedly reduced during combined TPN (4. 5 +/- 0. 8 v 20. 7 +/- 3. 7; P less than. 05). Plasma FFA levels were positively correlated with plasma insulin concentration (r =. 76) and inversely correlated to G/I X 100 (r = -. 73; both P less than. 05).

40|$|OBJECTIVE-Physical {{activity}} (PA), even at low intensity, promotes {{health and}} improves hyperglycemia. However, {{the effect of}} low-intensity PA captured with accelerometery on glucose variability in healthy individuals and patients with type 1 diabetes has not been examined. Quantifying the effects of PA on glycemic variability would improve <b>artificial</b> endocrine <b>pancreas</b> (AEP) algorithms. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-We studied 12 healthy control subjects (five males, 37. 7 +/- 13. 7 years of age) and 12 patients with type 1 diabetes (five males, 37. 4 +/- 14. 2 years of age) for 88 h. Participants performed PA approximating a threefold increase over their basal metabolic rate. PA was captured using a PA-monitoring system, and interstitial fluid glucose concentrations were captured with continuous glucose monitors. In random order, one meal per day was followed by inactivity, and the other meals were followed by walking. Glucose and PA data {{for a total of}} 216 meals were analyzed from 30 min prior to meal ingestion to 270 min postmeal. RESULTS-In healthy subjects, the incremental glucose area under the curve was 4. 5 mmol/L/ 270 min for meals followed by walking, whereas it was 9. 6 mmol/L/ 270 min (P = 0. 022) for meals followed by inactivity. The corresponding glucose excursions for those with type 1 diabetes were 7. 5 mmol/L/ 270 min and 18. 4 mmol/L/ 270 min, respectively (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2001 Interactions of transplantable {{cells with}} {{synthetic}} polymers might influence {{the function of}} biohybrid artificial organs. This study explored growth and secretion of human insulin by transgenic betaG I/ 17 insulinoma cells cultured on surfaces bearing diamine groups (N 2), trifluoropropyl groups (F 3), and mixtures of the two. Glass and untreated polystyrene served as controls. Composition of N 2 -F 3 surfaces was controlled by the ratio of monomers in the silanization bath, as confirmed by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis and by conjugation of surface amines with fluorescein- 5 -isothiocyanate. Atomic-force microscopy revealed that silanized surfaces were patchy, though their root-mean-square roughnesses {{did not differ significantly}} from that of smooth glass (0. 3 nm). Surfaces richest in trifluoropropyl residues were the most hydrophobic, with advancing water-contact angles ≥ 90 °. Cells cultured on pure F 3 and pure N 2 surfaces spread well, grew rapidly, and produced > 1. 8 moles lactate per mole glucose consumed, closely resembling cells grown on the permissive control, glass. On one mixed surface, 33 N 2 : 67 F 3, cells had a lower lactate/glucose ratio, adopted a rounded form, grew slowly, and were quick to form emergent aggregates, similar to cultures on the inhibitory control, untreated polystyrene. Cultures on F 3 -rich surfaces secreted the most insulin, and, {{in the case of the}} pure F 3 surface, showed improved responsiveness to secretagogues. F 3 surfaces conditioned by betaG I/ 17 cells stimulated insulin secretion by subsequent cultures. Incubation of conditioned surfaces with high concentrations of a polyclonal anti-laminin serum prior to re-plating partially abolished this improvement in secretory function. Together, these observations suggest that polymers bearing trifluoropropyl groups and coated with laminin might be attractive candidates for use in the <b>artificial</b> endocrine <b>pancreas...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: We {{sought to}} test the {{feasibility}} and efficacy of bihormonal closed-loop blood glucose (BG) control that utilizes subcutaneous (SC) infusion of insulin and glucagon, a model-predictive control algorithm for determining insulin dosing, and a proportional-derivative control algorithm for determining glucagon dosing. Methods: Thirteen closed-loop experiments (~ 7 – 27 h in length) were conducted in six ambulatory diabetic pigs weighing 26 – 50 kg. In all experiments, venous BG was sampled through a central line in the vena cava. Efficacy was evaluated {{in terms of the}} controller’s ability to regulate BG in response to large meal disturbances (~ 5 g of carbohydrate per kilogram of body mass per meal) based only on regular frequent venous BG sampling and requiring only the subject’s weight for initialization. Results: Closed-loop results demonstrated successful BG regulation to normoglycemic range, with average insulinto-carbohydrate ratios between ~ 1 : 20 and 1 : 40 U/g. The total insulin bolus doses averaged ~ 6 U for a meal containing ~ 6 g per kilogram body mass. Mean BG values in two 24 h experiments were ~ 142 and ~ 155 mg/dl, with the total daily dose (TDD) of insulin being ~ 0. 8 – 1. 0 U per kilogram of body mass and the TDD of glucagon being ~ 0. 02 – 0. 05 mg. Results also affirmed the efficacy of SC doses of glucagon in staving off episodic hypoglycemia. Conclusions: We demonstrate the feasibility of bihormonal closed-loop BG regulation using a control system that employs SC infusion of insulin and glucagon as governed by an algorithm that reacts only to BG without any feedforward information regarding carbohydrate consumption or physical activity. As such, this study can reasonably be regarded as the first practical implementation of an <b>artificial</b> endocrine <b>pancreas</b> that has a hormonally derived counterregulatory capability.
