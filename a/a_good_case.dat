25|$|At the tribunal, Caspar's {{case was}} heard first. Caspar was {{suspended}} for four weeks. Coleman's defence was simple: he had simply retaliated to two unprovoked punches from Caspar (for which Caspar had been suspended). The VFL at that time made no allowance for provocation, the Players' Advocate Dan Minogue was thought to have made <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>case</b> for Coleman by arguing that any man, {{if he were a}} man at all, would hit back after being hit. Both the boundary umpire, Herb Kent, and goal umpire Allen gave evidence that Coleman had retaliated only after he had been punched twice by Caspar.|$|E

25|$|In these interviews, Morton {{claimed to}} have been born in 1885. He was aware that if he had been born in 1890, he would have been {{slightly}} too young to make <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>case</b> for being the inventor of jazz. He {{said in an interview that}} Buddy Bolden played ragtime but not jazz, a view not accepted by Bolden's other New Orleans contemporaries. The contradictions may stem from different definitions of the terms ragtime and jazz. These interviews, released in different forms over the years, were released on an eight-CD boxed set in 2005, The Complete Library of Congress Recordings. The collection won two Grammy Awards. The same year, Morton was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.|$|E
25|$|The major {{characters}} of the first season were divided between those {{on the side of}} the law and those involved in drug-related crime. The starring cast comprised characters from both groups. The investigating detail was launched by the actions of Detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West), whose insubordinate tendencies and personal problems overshadowed his ability. The detail was led by Lieutenant Cedric Daniels (Lance Reddick) who faced challenges balancing his career aspirations with his desire to produce <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>case.</b> Kima Greggs (Sonja Sohn) was a capable lead detective who faced jealousy from colleagues and worry about the dangers of her job from her domestic partner. Her investigative work was greatly helped by her confidential informant, a drug addict known as Bubbles (Andre Royo).|$|E
25|$|India's {{position}} on {{the establishment of the}} State of Israel was affected by many factors, including India's own partition on religious lines, and India's relationship with other nations. Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi believed the Jews had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>case</b> and a prior claim for Israel, but opposed the creation of Israel on religious or mandated terms. India voted against the Partitioning of Palestine plan of 1947 and voted against Israel's admission to the United Nations in 1949. Various proponents of Hindu nationalism supported or sympathised with the creation of Israel. Hindu Mahasabha leader Vinayak Damodar Savarkar supported the creation of Israel on both moral and political grounds, and condemned India's vote at the UN against Israel. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leader Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar admired Jewish nationalism and believed Palestine was the natural territory of the Jewish people, essential to their aspiration for nationhood.|$|E

25|$|Some areas once rich in mopane worms are now barren due to over-harvesting {{and lack}} of a proper {{sustainable}} approach to commercial mopane worm farming. <b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>case</b> is in Nkayi District, Zimbabwe, where most mopane woodland areas once produced a high population of these worms; but the harvests have decreased drastically. Suggestions of how to reintroduce the worms to these areas include re-colonisation. As the adult moth lives only three to four days, during which it must mate and lay eggs, {{there is only a}} small window of opportunity to relocate them. If this stage was to be successfully completed, collaboration with local farmers and communities would be required to ensure that the caterpillars are not harvested for a set number of years. It would thus be ensured that the area is adequately repopulated, so that a sustainable harvest is created for the future.|$|E
25|$|James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde) employs Kathy at The Dagmar wine bar, angering Pete, and {{the rift}} worsens {{when it becomes}} clear that James is romantically {{interested}} in Kathy. After work, James invites Kathy upstairs to his flat, but when he attempts to seduce her, Kathy tries to leave. James refuses to let her leave and his attempted seduction becomes rape. James is arrested and formally charged with rape. In the aftermath, Kathy becomes depressed and isolated from Pete, who never believes she is blameless so Kathy leaves him. James stands trial but tries bribing Kathy to withdraw her statement. Kathy pretends to take his hush money but tells the police so a listening DI tapes the conversation. She is forced to relive the rape for the trial, where a skillful barrister presents <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>case</b> for James. For a time it seems James could be acquitted, but to Kathy's relief, he is convicted and imprisoned for three years. During this time, Kathy finds unexpected support from Pete's first wife, Pat (Pam St. Clement), whom she had initially despised and they become close friends.|$|E
25|$|Further {{illustrations}} are plentiful. In East v Maurer where Maurer lied that {{he would}} not set up a barber competing with the one he was selling to East, Maurer was liable for East's normal market lost profits, costs of improvements and the price paid minus the business' selling price. In Smith New Court Ltd v Scrimgeour Vickers (Asset Management) Ltd Smith New Court Ltd was deceitfully told there were close rival bids for shares in a company called Ferranti IS Inc. Smith New Court Ltd bought, but then it transpired that massive fraud had occurred. The Court of Appeal held that only £1.2m was recoverable, the difference between the market price at the time of purchase and the real price, but the House of Lords held that the full losses of £11.8m were recoverable (even though the fraud was unconnected to the misrepresentation) because that loss was one which Smith New Court Ltd had due to entering the transaction after being deceived. In practice, because an action for negligent misrepresentation has now been developed through Hedley Byrne and the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1), it is often not beneficial to sue for deceit. The only certain difference is that the defence of contributory negligence is unavailable in a deceit action. But deceit is harder to prove, since evidence of a person's state of mind is needed. Because the charge can sink people's reputations, alleging deceit is also contrary to professional conduct rules at the bar, unless <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>case</b> exists. A large difference which is subject to debate, is that the causation and remoteness rules are more generous for deceit. Certainly this is true when comparing negligence and deceit. However, the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1), which was modelled on the law as it stood when the Act was passed, has the same causation rules as for deceit (see below).|$|E

500|$|According to photo {{historian}} David Burn [...] "there is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>case</b> to be {{made for}} the proposition that the greatest contribution that Scotland has made to the visual arts, possibly to the arts as a whole, is in the art of photography". In the early nineteenth century Scottish scientists James Clerk Maxwell and David Brewster played a major part {{in the development of the}} techniques of photography. Pioneering photographers included chemist Robert Adamson (1821–48) and artist David Octavius Hill (1821–48), who as Hill & Adamson formed the first photographic studio in Scotland at Rock House in Edinburgh in 1843. Their output of around 3,000 calotype images in four years are considered some of the first and finest artistic uses of photography.|$|E
500|$|The {{fighting}} at Hougoumont {{has often}} been characterised as a diversionary attack to draw in Wellington's reserves which escalated into an all-day battle and drew in French reserves instead. In fact there is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>case</b> to believe that both Napoleon and Wellington thought that holding Hougoumont was key to winning the battle. Hougoumont {{was a part of}} the battlefield that Napoleon could see clearly, and he continued to direct resources towards it and its surroundings all afternoon (33battalions in all, 14,000troops). Similarly, though the house never contained a large number of troops, Wellington devoted 21battalions (12,000troops) over the course of the afternoon in keeping the hollow way open to allow fresh troops and ammunition to reach the buildings. He moved several artillery batteries from his hard-pressed centre to support Hougoumont, and later stated that [...] "the success of the battle turned upon closing the gates at Hougoumont".|$|E

Noonan criticized Cardozo for not taking Palsgraf's circumstances into account when making his decision, and listed factors that may have influenced Cardozo against the plaintiff, including {{that he was a}} lifelong bachelor who did not have Palsgraf's experience of caring for children, and he may have frowned upon Wood's representation of Palsgraf (likely on a contingent fee, something not favored at the time). Posner, writing in 1990, disagreed with Noonan and with feminist critics following him, noting that judges take an oath to do equal justice to rich and poor, [...] "so the fact that Mrs. Palsgraf was poor would not have been a principled ground for bending the rules in her favor". Noonan had considered unjust the award of court costs against Palsgraf, and in her 2016 book, law professor Cathleen Kaveny agreed, [...] "the penalty imposed on Palsgraf for seeking justice through the courts was to deprive her, a single mother, of the ability to support her children... All judges, however can develop empathy. And in telling the story of Helen Palsgraf, Judge Noonan makes <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>case</b> for why they should." ...|$|E

500|$|In August 2011, [...] the CCAF won a case at {{a federal}} appeals court in California in which they objected to class action {{settlements}} and attorneys' fees in litigation regarding Bluetooth headsets. The original case over the headsets had been filed when lawyers had noticed news articles about potential hearing loss and headsets and filed suits on behalf of millions of Motorola and Plantronics customers. The prior settlement would have effectively paid consumers nothing but given the lawyers who negotiated the pact $850,000 in fees, amended by Frank and his firm. Frank regards the case as a milestone in his fight to prevent abuses. Frank also unsuccessfully filed an objection to a settlement in an antitrust case against Sirius XM Radio, which provided nothing for the plaintiffs, but a 100 percent payout of $13 million for the attorneys. Judge Harold Baer, Jr. ruled on 24 August that the settlement terms [...] "demonstrate sufficient fairness, adequacy and reasonableness" [...] and rejected Frank's claims.
