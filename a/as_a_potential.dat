Not only had the Soviet Union invaded Poland on 17 September 1939, following the German invasion beginning 1 September 1939, but even after the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 the latter saw Polish partisans loyal to the Polish Government in Exile more <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> obstacle to Soviet plans to take control of postwar Poland, than <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> ally.
