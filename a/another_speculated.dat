500|$|In October 2015, a fan-made Amiibo {{featuring}} Iwata's Mii avatar was crafted and auctioned for US$1,900 on eBay; all proceeds were to {{be donated}} to the Child's Play charity in his memory. Iwata was posthumously and unanimously granted the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2015 Golden Joystick Awards for his influence across the gaming industry. Iwata was also posthumously granted the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2016 DICE Awards. At the 2016 Game Developers Choice Awards, Iwata was honored with a short animated film by David Hellman, the artist who worked on Braid. A tribute in honor of Iwata reading [...] "This game is dedicated to our wingman who fell in battle" [...] was placed {{at the end of}} the credits for Star Fox Zero. <b>Another</b> <b>speculated</b> tribute appears in the Nintendo Switch 2017 launch title , a game in-development at the time of his death. A non-playable character, who bears a striking resemblance to Satoru Iwata, asks for the player to go atop Satori Mountain in search of the mystical Lord of the Mountain. Given the similarity between [...] "Satori" [...] and [...] "Satoru" [...] and the fact that the Lord of the Mountain is seen as a guiding spirit, many see this quest as an elaborate tribute to Mr. Iwata. [...] In September 2017, modders discovered that an emulated version of Golf, which Iwata programmed, is included in every Nintendo Switch console's firmware, and can be accessed when the date is set to July 11 by performing the signature pose from his Nintendo Direct appearances using the Joy-Con controllers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{models for}} the {{paintings}} were local farmhands, some of whom worked on the Cézanne family estate, the Jas de Bouffan. Each scene is depicted as one of quiet, still concentration; the men look down at their cards rather than at each other, with the cards being perhaps their sole means of communication outside of work. One critic described the scenes as [...] "human still life", while <b>another</b> <b>speculated</b> that the men's intense focus on their game mirrors that of the painter's absorption in his art.|$|E
60|$|I smile even at {{this late}} day when I think of what a simple I showed myself to be while setting about the task, for on {{summoning}} my comrades I was ashamed to tell them we were to work like drovers and farmers rather than as soldiers, therefore led each to understand we were bent on some secret mission to an island near by. And when one and <b>another</b> <b>speculated</b> as to the possible danger to be encountered, or of the opportunities of showing ourselves worthy to be called soldiers, I nursed such fancies until they believed we were going as an independent company to slaughter or to capture whole squads of trained, red-coated soldiers.|$|E
50|$|A {{competing}} theory {{identifies the}} second and third volume of the Kojiki as the actual contents of the Teiki. And yet <b>another</b> <b>speculates</b> that the Teiki and Kyūji were not two separate texts, but was rather a single unified text.|$|R
5000|$|She {{may have}} died in exile: one source speculates that that she died of hunger, {{isolated}} in Marseille. [...] <b>Another</b> <b>speculates</b> that {{she was one of}} many Jewish political exiles from Germany who failed to obtain exit visas from the French authorities and were rounded up and deported to concentration camps in Germany where many were killed.|$|R
50|$|In 1918, the building's {{name was}} changed to the Brumder Building in {{response}} to anti-German sentiment during World War I, and the statue was removed discreetly in the night. Efforts to trace {{the fate of the}} statue, which was stored for a while by sculptor Cyril Colnik, have proven futile, with one theory claiming that it was melted down for scrap during World War II, and <b>another</b> <b>speculating</b> that it may have gone to the Smithsonian Institution, and possibly still be there.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{have taken}} the {{etymology}} of Uist from Old Norse, meaning [...] "west", much like Westray in the Orkney Islands. <b>Another</b> <b>speculated</b> derivation of Uist from Old Norse is , derived from [...] meaning [...] "an abode, dwelling, domicile".|$|E

50|$|The {{main purpose}} of a nanosubmarine is to {{navigate}} the body and perform a specific task. The most speculated task is the treatment and diagnosis of diseases from within the body. This {{is supported by the}} task of detecting substances, as most diseases cause a specific type of protein or other molecule to be made in abundance within the bloodstream. <b>Another</b> <b>speculated</b> task is microsurgery. With this technology, doctors will be able to perform surgery on specific locations from within the body. One example of this could be a treatment for cancer. A nanosubmarine could be built to detect specific cancer cells within the body; after locating the cells, the nanosub would be able to kill only the mutated cells and ignore healthy cells.|$|E

5000|$|Arbor may {{be named}} from Arbor Lodge, {{the estate of}} Julius Sterling Morton, the 3rd United States Secretary of Agriculture. However, <b>another</b> source <b>speculates</b> that Arbor was likely named for the trees lining the town site. [...] Arbor had a post office from 1894 until 1900.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Another</b> <b>speculated</b> {{reason for}} racial {{restriction}} was called [...] "Mormon karma" [...] by Colin Kidd, and {{refers to the}} idea that skin color is perceived as evidence of righteousness (or lack thereof) in the premortal existence. The doctrine of premortal existence is described in the Encyclopedia of Mormonism in this way: [...] "to Latter-day Saints premortal life is characterized by individuality, agency, intelligence, and opportunity for eternal progression. It is a central doctrine of the theology of the Church and provides understanding to the age-old question 'Whence cometh man?'" [...] This idea is based on the opinions of several prominent church leaders, including apostle Joseph Fielding Smith, who held the view that the premortal life had been a kind of testing ground for the assignment of God's spiritual children to favored or disfavored mortal lineages. Bushman has also noted Smith's long-time teachings that in a premortal war in heaven, blacks were considered to have been those spirits who did not fight as valiantly against Satan and who, as a result, received a lesser earthly stature, with such restrictions as being disqualified from holding the priesthood. According to religious historian Craig Prentiss, the appeal to premortal existence was confirmed as doctrine through statements of the LDS First Presidency in 1949 and 1969.|$|E

5000|$|After Fra Mauro's mention, {{there is}} a profusion of {{literature}} about the peoples of this region including the Oromo, particularly mentioning their wars and resistance to religious conversion, primarily by European sea explorers, Christian and Islamic missionaries as well as regional writers. Fra Mauro's term Galla is the most used term, however, until the early 20th century. The earliest primary account of Oromo ethnography is the 16th-century [...] "History of Galla" [...] by Christian monk Bahrey who comes from the Sidama country of Gammo, written in the Ge'ez language. He begins his treatise on the Oromo by introducing them in racist terms. According to an 1861 book by D'Abbadie, a French explorer who traveled up to Kaffa in 1843, {{he was told that}} the word Galla was derived from a [...] "war cry" [...] and used by the Gallas themselves. A journal published by International African Institute suggests it is an Oromo word (adopted by neighbours) for {{there is a}} word galla [...] "wandering" [...] in their language. The first known use of the word Oromo to refer to this ethnic group is traceable to 1893. The historic term for them has been Galla. This term, stated Juxon Barton in 1924, was in use for these people by Abyssinians and Arabs. The word Galla has been variously interpreted, such as it means [...] "to go home", or it refers to a river named Galla in early Abyssinian tradition. <b>Another</b> <b>speculated</b> origin, states Barton, for their historic name is from the Muslim tradition, which states that when Muhammad asked them to accept Islam, the chief of this ethnic group said [...] "Gha la" [...] or [...] "no", thus their name [...] "Galla".|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> view <b>speculates</b> {{that the}} Storegga tsunami devastated Doggerland but then ebbed {{back into the}} sea, and that later Lake Agassiz (in North America) burst {{releasing}} so much fresh water that sea levels over about two years rose to flood much of Doggerland and make Britain an island.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> source <b>speculated</b> on what {{considerations}} {{should be}} used to choose a Science Laureate. These included avoiding unrelated controversy, diversity (to better represent a diverse American public), active research, diversity (in research fields, from one laureate to the next), and finding someone willing to do it, despite the position being unpaid.|$|R
50|$|Plantet is a {{red wine}} grape variety {{that was one of}} the hybrid grape created by French {{physician}} and grape breeder Albert Seibel. While the exact parentage of the grape is unknown, the most popular theories has it as a cross of two Seibel grapes, Seibel 867 x Seibel 2524 with <b>another</b> theory <b>speculating</b> that Plantet's parentage was Seibel 4461 crossed with Berlandieri-Jacquez.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Another</b> rumor <b>speculates</b> that N. Senada {{may have}} been Captain Beefheart because in the late 1960s Beefheart and his [...] "Magic Band" [...] lived in a {{residence}} on Ensenada Drive in Woodland Hills, California, while recording Trout Mask Replica and Safe as Milk; Beefheart influence can also be heard in early Residents works. The Residents also sent an early demo tape to the Warner Brothers executive Hal Halverstadt who had signed Beefheart.|$|R
5000|$|The Torchwood episode [...] "Cyberwoman" [...] {{features}} a partially cyber-converted woman who lacks the outer plating of a fully converted Cyberman. Her body is encased in metal structures {{but much of}} her flesh, including her face, is visible. She also has clearly visible metallic breasts, {{though it is not}} clear how much of her own flesh has been replaced and how much is merely covered. <b>Another</b> character <b>speculates</b> she could be 40-45% human, and 55-60% Cyberman.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike Verdi, Puccini was not {{active in}} politics. Puccini biographer Mary Jane Phillips-Matz wrote: [...] "Throughout this entire period World War I and its {{immediate}} aftermath, Puccini's interest in politics {{was close to}} zero, {{as it had been}} all his life, so far as one can judge. He seemed almost indifferent to everything from mayoral elections in Viareggio to cabinet appointments in Rome." [...] <b>Another</b> biographer <b>speculates</b> that Puccini may have been—if he had a political philosophy—a monarchist.|$|R
5000|$|Gustavo is a Spanish, Italian and Portuguese male {{given name}} derived from Gustav /ˈɡʊstɑːv/, also spelled Gustaf, of Old Swedish origin, {{possibly}} meaning [...] "staff of the Geats", {{derived from the}} Old Norse elements Gautr ("Geat") and stafr ("staff"). It is a common name for Swedish monarchs since the reign of Gustav Vasa. <b>Another</b> etymology <b>speculates</b> that the name may have a Slavic origin, through Swedish, from [...] "Gostislav", a compound word from Old Slavic [...] "Gost'" [...] ("guest") and [...] "slava" [...] ("glory").|$|R
5000|$|The {{game was}} met with a {{generally}} favorable reception. The gameplay received criticism for its interface {{and the difficulty of}} keyboard or joystick control as compared to mouse controls. The [...] "Monkey Kombat" [...] was also criticized, with the GameSpot review stating that [...] "unfortunately Monkey Kombat may be the single biggest problem with Escape from Monkey Island". <b>Another</b> reviewer <b>speculated</b> that [...] "Perhaps the designers figured that combining insult fighting, cute monkeys, and a Mortal Kombat spoof would work well, but it didn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|Hume {{writes to}} a friend: [...] "The office is very genteel, 10s. a day, perquisites, and no expenses;" [...] and, to <b>another,</b> he <b>speculates</b> {{on the chance}} of {{procuring}} a company in an American regiment. [...] "But this I build not on, nor indeed am I very fond of it," [...] he adds; and this was fortunate, for the expedition, after dawdling away the summer in port, was suddenly diverted to an attack on L'Orient, where it achieved a huge failure and returned ignominiously to England.|$|R
5000|$|Asterion {{goes into}} {{detail about the}} infinitude of his house, {{comparing}} it to the universe. He also suggests that perhaps he created the world and has forgotten about it. Finally he makes mention of other people, nine men, who come every nine years [...] "so that I may deliver them from evil", and whose bodies he leaves in the empty rooms to distinguish one from <b>another.</b> Asterion <b>speculates</b> about his own death, and eagerly awaits the coming of his [...] "redeemer", who will take him away from his infinite house.|$|R
500|$|Moore, who had {{not been}} {{directly}} involved in any military engagement during the Revolutionary War, was nonetheless able to construct a working military force out of the disparate parts provided for him by North Carolina. [...] Samuel A'Court Ashe, an early North Carolina historian, described Moore as [...] "perhaps the most masterful military man furnished by North Carolina to the war of independence." [...] <b>Another</b> historian <b>speculated</b> that Moore's [...] "actions had held the promise of greatness." [...] Moore's strategic command before and during the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge has been acclaimed as {{a major factor in the}} Patriot victory there.|$|R
60|$|We {{are now in}} a {{position}} to point out and consider certain general ways in which the various factors and elements in the deliquescent society of the present time will react one upon <b>another,</b> and to <b>speculate</b> what definite statements, if any, it may seem reasonable to make about the individual people of the year 2000--or thereabouts--from the reaction of these classes we have attempted to define.|$|R
30|$|<b>Another</b> {{reason for}} <b>speculating</b> that {{some degree of}} market power exists in the input market {{is the fact that}} {{according}} to OVOP (2011) {{one of the reasons for}} the establishment of the cooperative is to negotiate better prices with processors. Although this is mentioned in terms of rewarding the production of higher quality milk, it also may imply that the processors have the capacity to set prices.|$|R
5000|$|Some <b>speculated</b> <b>another</b> Space World {{consumer}} event {{would be}} held in 2005 for the formal unveiling of Nintendo's next console, Revolution (the development name for the Wii). This speculation was incorrect as Nintendo chose to fully reveal at E3 2006, {{the details of the}} system which would be renamed to [...] "Wii". However, they did hold an event called Nintendo World 2006 that showcased the Wii and Nintendo DS.|$|R
5000|$|Elkins's second {{argument}} {{was that the}} experience of slavery was psychologically infantilizing to slaves, making them follow what he controversially called the [...] "Sambo" [...] model. He based his arguments on then-recent sociological and psychological research by Bruno Bettelheim and others on inmates of Nazi concentration camps during World War II, showing that the totalitarian environment systematically destroyed their ability to resist, to plan, and to form positive relationships with one <b>another.</b> Elkins <b>speculated</b> that antebellum slavery was a similar environment and instilled an infantilized, dependent personality pattern. One implication, only partially spelled out in Elkins's account, was that this personality pattern might persist in his own time, a century after the end of slavery. Elkins' views were influential during the late 1960s when Daniel Patrick Moynihan supported affirmative action programs in order to counteract the lingering effects of slavery on black culture.|$|R
2500|$|According to {{an article}} that briefly {{appeared}} on Thursday 17 August 2000 on the website of the official newspaper of the Russian Defence Ministry, Krasnaya Zvezda, Kursk had been refitted in 1998—four {{years after it was}} commissioned—to carry torpedoes fueled using the cheap HTP. The article reported that some specialists in the Russian Navy opposed use of the HTP-fueled torpedoes because they were volatile and dangerous. The story did not appear in the print edition on Friday 18 August. Instead, the article was replaced with <b>another</b> that <b>speculated</b> the submarine had collided with an [...] "unidentified object". The change was likely due to political pressure. Vice-premier Ilya Klebanov, chair of the government commission investigating the accident, had a vested interest in suggesting the disaster had been caused by a collision with a NATO vessel. As head of the defence industries, over the objections of some officers, he had promoted use of the liquid-fueled torpedoes over safer, more-expensive silver-zinc battery-powered torpedoes.|$|R
60|$|The haze was {{thinning}} and now {{and then}} the blurred outline of trees broke through; but one belt of forest looked like <b>another</b> and she <b>speculated</b> with some uneasiness about the chance of Thirlwell's finding the river. If he did not find it, they would run some risk, because the men could not paddle to windward and the canoes might be smashed on a steep, rocky beach. They ran on, and sometimes the trees got plainer and sometimes vanished, but at length, when a savage gust rolled the haze away, Agatha saw an unbroken line of rocks and foam. It looked very forbidding and she wondered what Thirlwell would do.|$|R
5000|$|Gustav , also spelled Gustaf, is a male {{given name}} of likely Old Swedish origin, used mainly in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, and South Africa, {{possibly}} meaning [...] "staff of the Geats or Goths or gods", possibly {{derived from the}} Old Norse elements Gautr ("Geats"), Gutar/Gotar ("Goths"), goð ōs ("gods") and the word stafr ("staff"). <b>Another</b> etymology <b>speculates</b> that the name may be of Medieval Slavic origin, from the name Gostislav, a compound word for [...] "glorious guest", from the Medieval Slavic words Gosti ("guest") and slava ("glory") and was adopted by migrating groups north and west into Germany and Scandinavia. This name has been borne by eight Kings of Sweden, including the 16th-century Gustav Vasa and the current king, Carl XVI Gustaf. It is a common name for Swedish monarchs since the reign of Gustav Vasa.The name has entered other languages as well. In French it is Gustave; in Italian and in the Portuguese and Spanish language it is Gustavo. The Latinised form is Gustavus. A side form of the name in Swedish is Gösta. The name in Finnish is Kustaa. In Icelandic, it is written Gústav or Gústaf.|$|R
500|$|... "I'll Be Your Lover, Too" [...] was {{inspired}} by Morrison and Planet's marriage. This acoustic ballad has a moderate 4/4 tempo, with one 5/8 bar before the vocal comes in. [...] "Blue Money", a pun-filled reference to Morrison's financial situation, is about a model, perhaps his wife. (Planet worked in the industry before meeting Morrison.) [...] "Sweet Jannie" [...] is the second twelve-bar blues on the album; written about young love, the song is <b>another</b> that reviewers <b>speculated</b> was about Planet. The lyrics, [...] "I've {{been in love with}} you baby / Ever since you were in Sunday school" [...] lead Clinton Heylin to believe it was written about memories from Morrison's childhood when he attended Sunday school in Belfast; Planet is a California-raised Texan.|$|R
5000|$|The {{discovery}} of the Malagana Treasure began with an accident in a sugar-cane field at Hacienda Malagana, which is situated on the flatlands of the fertile Cauca river valley, {{near the city of}} Palmira in western Colombia. A worker was driving a piece of heavy equipment (a tractor) across the field when the ground suddenly collapsed, and the vehicle fell into a large hole. As the driver inspected his predicament, something shiny caught his eye. The object was made of gold, and the hole {{turned out to be an}} ancient hypogeum. The worker removed some of the goldwork items and quietly sold them. Before long, his activities caught the attention of others. Between October and December 1992, hoards of gold-seekers arrived to Hacienda Malagana's sugar-cane field. [...] According to newspaper accounts, the looters numbered as many as 5,000. Reporters on the scene captured the bedlam on camera and published their photographs in newspapers. Even the police and army on the scene were ineffective in controlling the chaos, including one murder, and the wide scale destruction of the ancient cemetery. Countless artifacts were carried off by the treasure hunters. The weight of the gold objects that were taken from the site has been estimated at 160 kilograms (352 pounds) by one source (Bray 2000:94) and between 140 kilograms (308 pounds) and 180 kilograms (396 pounds) by <b>another,</b> who <b>speculates</b> that the amount might even have been greater than 180 kilograms.|$|R
6000|$|... "And we on foot," [...] {{said the}} elder; [...] "nor shall we stop till we reach Mowbray;" [...] {{and with a}} slight salute, they left Egremont alone. There was {{something}} in the manner of the elder stranger which repressed the possibility of Egremont following him. Leaving then the cloister garden in <b>another</b> direction, he <b>speculated</b> on meeting them outside the abbey. He passed through the Lady's chapel. The beautiful Religious was not there. He gained the west front; no one was visible. He took a rapid survey of each side of the abbey; not a being to be recognized. He fancied they must have advanced towards the Abbey Farm; yet they might have proceeded further on in the dale. Perplexed, he lost time. Finally he proceeded towards the farm, but did not overtake them; reached it, but learned nothing of them; and arrived at his brother's full of a strange yet sweet perplexity.|$|R
