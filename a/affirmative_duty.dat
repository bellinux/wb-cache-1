40|$|DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services is the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s {{first major}} effort {{to define the}} scope {{of state and local}} governments 2 ̆ 7 affirmative {{obligations}} under the fourteenth amendment. The Court rejected liability against a county welfare agency and a caseworker for failing to prevent a father from severely beating his four-year-old son. The Court intimated that constitutional <b>affirmative</b> <b>duties</b> exist only where the plaintiff is in the state 2 ̆ 7 s custody. Scholarly commentary reads the case as announcing a sweeping prohibition against the imposition of <b>affirmative</b> <b>duties</b> in other contexts. Professors Eaton and Wells demonstrate that the DeShaney opinion is more ambiguous and less categorical than the preliminary scholarly consensus suggests. They argue that much of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s reasoning supports a more discriminating treatment of constitutional affirmative duties; one that acknowledges the various ways in which the state may play a part in making someone vulnerable to harm. Although in DeShaney 2 ̆ 7 s aftermath some lower courts embrace the 2 ̆ 2 sweeping prohibition 2 ̆ 2 view of the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s opinion, many other courts examine the state 2 ̆ 7 s role in exposing the plaintiff to danger.

2500|$|Furthermore, they {{ruled that}} the DSS {{could not be found}} liable, as a matter of {{constitutional}} law, for failure to protect Joshua DeShaney from a private actor. [...] Although there exist conditions in which the state (or a subsidiary agency, like a county department of social services) is obligated to provide protection against private actors, and failure to do so is a violation of Fourteenth Amendment rights, the court reasoned, [...] "The <b>affirmative</b> <b>duty</b> to protect arises not from the State's knowledge of the individual's predicament or from its expressions of intent to help him, but from the limitation which it has imposed on his freedom to act on his own behalf... it is the State's affirmative act of restraining the individual's freedom to act on his own behalf - through incarceration, institutionalization, or other similar restraint of personal liberty - which is the [...] "deprivation of liberty" [...] triggering the protections of the Due Process Clause, not its failure to act to protect his liberty interests against harms inflicted by other means.".

40|$|The article aims to make {{problematic}} {{the relative}} absence {{of questions about}} the <b>affirmative</b> <b>duties</b> of legislators to pass laws to achieve various welfarist ends in liberal constitutional theory. The duty to legislate for the public good is a bedrock of both classical and modern liberal theory, yet there is almost nothing in liberal constitutional theory about the possible constitutional grounding of the moral duties, whether enumerated or unenumerated, of legislators. The full explanation for this absence rests on a set of jurisprudential assumptions that lead moral questions about governance to be understood solely as adjudicative questions of law. Yet it has become quite clear that governmental officials can on occasion be in profound breach of their non-justiciable duty to provide 2 ̆ 2 protection of the laws. ” If that matters, then constitutional lawyers and scholars ought not wall themselves off from the ensuing dialogue regarding the nature of that duty and its breach...|$|R

40|$|This Note {{argues that}} nonclinician administrators {{employed}} by {{institutions of higher}} education do not have a special relationship with their students such that they have a duty to act with reasonable care to prevent a foreseeable student suicide. Courts that have in recent years ruled to the contrary have done so by incorrectly basing their duty-of-care analysis on foreseeability of harm alone. With an eye toward a proper duty-of-care analysis, this Note analyzes multiple factors to reach its conclusion, including the ideal relationship between colleges and their students and the burden on and capability of colleges to protect their students from a particular harm. Moreover public policy concerns weigh heavily against imposing a duty on nonclinician university administrators. This Note further argues that the tort doctrine of negligent performance of <b>affirmative</b> <b>duties</b> undertaken provides a better framework within which to assess the liability of {{institutions of higher education}} for student suicides by holding those institutions responsible for egregious missteps regarding student mental health problems. Liability pursuant to negligent performance of affirmitive duties undertaken requires that colleges and universities implement and operate their programs with due care, but leaves sufficient latitude for individual colleges and universities to explore suicide prevention techniques that are effective and feasible in light of their student body, resources, and overall educational philosophy...|$|R

40|$|Property {{is closely}} {{associated}} with freedom. Following {{the demise of the}} feudal property system, property ownership in Anglo-American law came to imply an individual 2 ̆ 7 s freedom to act as she pleases on her land. For their part, modern property theories—whether right-based, utilitarian, or relational—employ the normative value of freedom to justify ownership. Courts and scholars have always acknowledged the fact that this freedom of the owner cannot be absolute: an owner 2 ̆ 7 s freedom to do as she pleases on her land is often limited to protect other owners. However, the consensual assumption remains that an owner is not subject to <b>affirmative</b> <b>duties.</b> She is free, according to conventional wisdom, to choose to do nothing with her property. This Article argues that this assumption is simply wrong. Owners are not free to ignore their land. Property law has always subjected them to an obligation to maintain their land up to a specific standard. This obligation, dubbed here 2 ̆ 2 the duty to maintain, 2 ̆ 2 is enforced through an array of legal rules and practices. This Article chronicles these rules and practices for the first time, classifying them in accordance with the enforcement mechanism they employ. It then justifies these diverse rules and practices—and the general duty to maintain—in light of the different theories of property. In this fashion, this Article illustrates that ownership, both as a legal institution and as a normative concept, inherently and inevitably incorporates a duty to maintain...|$|R
40|$|Confronting {{persistent}} and widening inequality in educational opportunity, advocates have regarded {{the right to}} education as a linchpin for reform. In the forty years since the Supreme Court relegated that right to the domain of state constitutional law, its power has surged and faded in litigation challenging state school finance systems. Like {{so many of the}} students it is meant to protect, however, the right to education has generally underachieved, in part because those wielding it have not always appreciated its distinctive forms and function. Deconstructed, the right to education held by children has been formulated doctrinally as both a claim-right, imposing <b>affirmative</b> <b>duties</b> on the state to act, and an immunity, disabling certain state action. These two strands—oft-manifested as the claim-right to educational “adequacy” and an immunity entailing “equality” of educational opportunity—once considered irreconcilable, are actually interlocked by the right’s core historical function to protect children’s liberty and equality interests. And yet the right to education is ill equipped to fulfill its protection function. Education clauses in state constitutions do not fix the standards for mutually enforcing equality and adequacy. This encumbers already-reluctant courts in addressing educational disparities and emboldens legislative resistance when they do. Appreciating that the right to education has a protection function entailing equality and liberty interests nevertheless suggests that the right can be adjudicated in a way that unifies the demands and guarantees of substantive due process and equal protection. That union holds the potential to ameliorate the enforcement standards thereby reconstituting the right to education as a mainstay of reform...|$|R
40|$|From its {{inception}} in 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has been a groundbreaking piece of civil rights legislation: a highly flexible, individually responsive law that intended to bring 2 ̆ 2 some 43, 000, 0002 ̆ 2 disabled Americans into society 2 ̆ 7 s mainstream. To ensure the envisioned access and opportunity, the ADA sought to replicate {{for people with disabilities}} the type of protections that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provided to women and minorities. It barred {{discrimination on the basis of}} disability in employment and required that all public entities and public accommodations provided by private entities be accessible to the disabled population.

40|$|Most American state constitutions contain equal {{protection}} clauses. The words in these clauses often follow {{the words in}} the {{equal protection}} clause of the federal constitution. Not surprisingly perhaps, many state courts read their own clauses as providing no greater equalities than are afforded federally, following "in lockstep". But some American state constitutions have special equality provisions having no federal counterparts. Such clauses not only facilitate, but seemingly require, greater independent state constitutionalism. For example, in Illinois there are three special equality provisions beyond the general equal protection clause. They deal with employment, housing, local government and school districts. Of course, special provisions can extend, but never diminish, federal constitutional, statutory and regulatory equalities. In Illinois and elsewhere in the United States, constitutional equalities are promoted by provisions guaranteeing the equal protection of the laws and insuring freedom from discrimination. These two types of provisions typically are read as seeking comparable forms of equality and anticipating similar types of remedies. State Human Rights Commissions and their equivalents have been broadly delegated powers in many states regarding both equal protection and nondiscrimination. Nevertheless, there are sometimes reasons to treat differently equality and nondiscrimination provisions. Equality duties are often limited to governmental acts, as in the federal constitution, while nondiscrimination responsibilities are extended at times to private acts. As well, even where laws treat people and entities equally, discrimination may continue or arise. Antidiscrimination provisions can be read to impose upon government some <b>affirmative</b> <b>duties</b> to end discrimination not caused by government. This paper was first presented on January 16, 2009 at a symposium sponsored by the Charleston Law School and the Riley Institute at Furman that was entitled, "State Constitutional Reform in the New South. " The paper explores the extent to which American states in the New South should promote greater constitutional equalities and nondiscrimination than are afforded federally. It begins by examining the benefits of special equality and nondiscrimination guarantees. It then examines American state experiences inside and outside the New South. Finally, it explores arenas where new explicit guarantees seem warranted, finding one special Illinois equality provision particularly inviting...|$|R

The CRPD explicitly mandates that work is a right accorded to individuals with disabilities, and global employers are now being challenged to implement that right. Yet, in order to ensure meaningful, universal compliance with its directives, the CRPD imposes <b>affirmative</b> <b>duties</b> on Supporting States to develop a customized, workable plan that effectively addresses the biases about individuals with disabilities in the workplace. Among the recommendations to achieve meaningful compliance, the CRPD advises Supporting States to modify their existing mediation and conciliation programs within their human rights institutions to meet the CRPD imperative. To meaningfully implement the CRPD, Supporting States must address the attitudinal biases that abound against individuals with disabilities, especially among employment recruiters, employers, employees, and even lawyers representing aggrieved clients, all individuals who are instrumental in implementing the CRPD mandates. Unless these biases in all their cultural variants are addressed, enforcement efforts, such as the establishment of mediation and conciliation programs, will be neutered. This Article focuses on the challenges of designing such effective, culturally sensitive mediation and conciliation programs to resolve global workplace discrimination against individuals with disabilities. Part One explains the CRPD and its mandates, focusing on its workplace imperatives. Part Two illustrates the scope and magnitude of the discrimination through harrowing statistics.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the economic {{consequences of the}} new internal control reporting (ICR) requirements imposed by Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). I formulate a model that emphasizes the strategic interaction between internal control and external audit in detecting accounting manipulation {{as well as the}} multiple roles of accounting information in financial reporting. In the model, the audited financial report serves both valuation (in which potential investors use the report to assess a firm's expected future payoff) and stewardship (in which the current owner of the firm relies on the same report to monitor and incentivize the manager) roles, but might be misstated by the manager if the firm's internal control system is weak and the fraudulent act is not detected by the external auditor. The firm's unobservable investment in the quality of its internal control determines the probability that the actual internal control system is weak. The ability to override weak internal controls and hence misstate the audited financial report, which reflects the performance of the manager, will dampen the manager's incentive to exert effort that improves the value of the firm. Thus, lower internal control quality, if not rectified by higher external audit quality, will result in a loss of contract efficiency. A misstated audited financial report, however, allows the current owner of the firm to sell the firm's shares to outside investors at an inflated price. The external auditor chooses the optimal audit effort to minimize the sum of the cost of auditing and the expected legal cost arising from a possible audit failure. Anticipating how the external auditor will react to his/her choice, the current owner of the firm chooses a quality of internal control to tradeoff the valuation and stewardship values derived from the accounting information. This paper studies how this tradeoff is affected by the new ICR requirements under SOX that impose <b>affirmative</b> <b>duties</b> on managers and auditors to evaluate and attest to the effectiveness of internal controls and disclose any control weaknesses. I make predictions regarding the effects on a firm's choices of compensation policy and internal control quality as well as its external auditor's choice of audit effort; all these elements being important determinants of the accuracy of the firm's accounting information. Comparative static results are also provided to investigate how the above equilibrium variables are influenced by exogenous changes in the diverging financial reporting incentives, the auditor's legal penalty and the severity of the agency problem...|$|R
