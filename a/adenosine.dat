5|$|Carbon dioxide (CO2), <b>adenosine</b> mono{{phosphate}} (AMP) and phosphate groups (PP) {{are released}} as waste products. Luciferase catalyzes the reaction, {{which may be}} mediated by cofactors such as calcium (Ca2+) or magnesium (Mg2+) ions, and for some types of luciferin (L) also the energy-carrying molecule <b>adenosine</b> triphosphate (ATP). The reaction can occur either inside or outside the cell. In bacteria such as Aliivibrio, the expression of genes related to bioluminescence {{is controlled by the}} lux operon.|$|E
5|$|Coenzymes {{are small}} organic {{molecules}} {{that can be}} loosely or tightly bound to an enzyme. Coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another. Examples include NADH, NADPH and <b>adenosine</b> triphosphate (ATP). Some coenzymes, such as flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), and tetrahydrofolate (THF), are derived from vitamins. These coenzymes cannot be synthesized by the body de novo and closely related compounds (vitamins) must be acquired from the diet. The chemical groups carried include the hydride ion (H−) carried by NAD or NADP+, the phosphate group carried by <b>adenosine</b> triphosphate, the acetyl group carried by coenzyme A, formyl, methenyl or methyl groups carried by folic acid and the methyl group carried by S-adenosylmethionine.|$|E
5|$|Helicases are {{proteins}} {{that are a}} type of molecular motor. They use the chemical energy in nucleoside triphosphates, predominantly <b>adenosine</b> triphosphate (ATP), to break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind the DNA double helix into single strands. These enzymes are essential for most processes where enzymes need to access the DNA bases.|$|E
25|$|Expression of MMP3 is {{primarily}} regulated {{at the level}} of transcription, where the promoter of the gene responds to various stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, tumor promoters, and oncogene products. A polymorphism in the promoter of the MMP3 gene was first reported in 1995. The polymorphism is caused by a variation in the number of <b>adenosines</b> located at position -1171 relative to the transcription start site, resulting in one allele having five <b>adenosines</b> (5A) and the other allele having six <b>adenosines</b> (6A). In vitro promoter functional analyses showed that the 5A allele had greater promoter activities as compared with the 6A allele. It has been shown in different studies that individuals carrying the 5A allele have increased susceptibility to diseases attributed to increased MMP expression, such as acute myocardial infarction and abdominal aortic aneurysm.|$|R
50|$|The TD-1 RNA's {{secondary}} structure {{is supported by}} covariation (see {{secondary structure}} prediction), but there are an unusual number of stems containing runs of <b>adenosines</b> that base pair with coordinate runs of uridines.|$|R
50|$|PMS2 is a {{gene that}} encodes for DNA repair {{proteins}} involved in mismatch repair. The PMS2 gene is located on chromosome 7p22 and it consists of 15 exons. Exon 11 of the PMS2 gene has a coding repeat of eight <b>adenosines.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1976 a {{bacteriophage}} - S-2L - which infects {{species of}} the genus Synechocystis {{was found to have}} all the <b>adenosine</b> bases within its genome replaced by 2,6-diaminopurine. In 2016 deoxyarchaeosine was found to be present in the genomes of several bacteria and the Escherichia phage 9g.|$|E
5|$|Nucleic acid {{amplification}} {{tests and}} <b>adenosine</b> deaminase testing may allow rapid diagnosis of TB. These tests, however, are not routinely recommended, as they rarely alter {{how a person}} is treated. Blood tests to detect antibodies are not specific or sensitive, so they are not recommended.|$|E
5|$|The type of RNA editing {{that is most}} {{prevalent}} in higher eukaryotes converts <b>adenosine</b> nucleotides into inosine in dsRNAs via the enzyme <b>adenosine</b> deaminase (ADAR). It was originally proposed in 2000 that the RNAi and A→I RNA editing pathways might compete for a common dsRNA substrate. Some pre-miRNAs do undergo A→I RNA editing and this mechanism may regulate the processing and expression of mature miRNAs. Furthermore, at least one mammalian ADAR can sequester siRNAs from RNAi pathway components. Further support for this model comes from studies on ADAR-null C. elegans strains indicating that A→I RNA editing may counteract RNAi silencing of endogenous genes and transgenes.|$|E
50|$|Preparing TNP-ATP is a {{one-step}} synthesis that {{is relatively}} safe and easy. <b>Adenosine’s</b> ribose moiety can be trinitrophenylated by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene-1-sulfonate (TNBS). The resulting compound assumes a bright orange color and has visible absorption characteristics, as {{is characteristic of}} a Meiseinheimer spiro complex compound linking.|$|R
40|$|Cytochrome oxidase subunit 3 (Cox 3) is a mitochondrion-encoded core {{membrane}} protein of complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, {{and consists of}} seven trans-membrane helices. Here we show that in diverse later-branching dinoflagellates, cox 3 is consistently split into two exons in the mitochondrial genome between helices six and seven. Gene exons are transcribed as two discrete oligoadenylated precursor RNAs, and these are subsequently trans-spliced to form a complete coding mRNA. This trans-splicing is highly unusual in {{that some of the}} oligoadenylated tail is incorporated at the splice site, such that a short string of <b>adenosines</b> links the two coding exons. This feature is consistently represented in diverse dinoflagellates, however the number of <b>adenosines</b> added varies according {{to the size of the}} coding gap between the two exons. Thus we observed between zero (Amphidinium carterae) and 10 (Symbiodinium sp.) <b>adenosines</b> added in different taxa, but the final coding sequence length is identical with the reading frame maintained. Northern analyses show that precursor cox 3 transcripts are approximately equally abundant as mature cox 3 mRNAs, suggesting a slow or regulated maturation process. These data indicate that the splicing mechanism in dinoflagellate mitochondria is tolerant of variations in the length of the precursor coding sequence, and implicates the use of a splicing template, or guide molecule, during splicing that controls mature mRNA length...|$|R
40|$|Whole {{transcriptome}} analysis {{reveals that}} {{one third of}} human and mouse genes express mRNAs containing methylated <b>adenosines.</b> Fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene, a risk gene for obesity and metabolic abnor-malities, demethylates the modified residues, suggesting a link between RNA methylation and disease. Vertebrate ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), messenger RNAs (mRNAs) as well as viral RNAs can be methylated at the N 6 position of <b>adenosines</b> to produce N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A). Although the presence of m 6 A modi-fications in mRNA {{has been known for}} decades and a handful of vertebrate m 6 A-modified mRNAs have been identified, the ex-tent of m 6 A modification in mRNAs was unknown. Two recent articles using massively parallel sequencing found that mRNAs from more than one third of human and mouse genes contain m 6 A. 1, 2 N 6 -methyladenosines were found to be enriched nea...|$|R

These sterols are unique to this species. Additionally, the compounds ergosta-7,22-dien-3β-ol, uridine, allitol, ergosterol, ergosterol5α,8α-peroside, ergothioneine, <b>adenosine,</b> and uracil have been identified from the mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|Another {{mechanism}} involves {{effects on}} the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain {{that is responsible for}} effective tissue utilization of oxygen. Carbon monoxide binds to cytochrome oxidase with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding. This binding interferes with aerobic metabolism and efficient <b>adenosine</b> triphosphate synthesis. Cells respond by switching to anaerobic metabolism, causing anoxia, lactic acidosis, and eventual cell death. The rate of dissociation between carbon monoxide and cytochrome oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of oxidative metabolism.|$|E
5|$|In epileptic {{seizures}} a {{group of}} neurons begin firing in an abnormal, excessive, and synchronized manner. This results {{in a wave of}} depolarization known as a paroxysmal depolarizing shift. Normally, after an excitatory neuron fires it becomes more resistant to firing for a period of time. This {{is due in part to}} the effect of inhibitory neurons, electrical changes within the excitatory neuron, and the negative effects of <b>adenosine.</b>|$|E
40|$|Unpaired {{bases in}} DNA have been {{assigned}} a possible role in the mechanism of frameshift mutagenesis in sequences with repeated base pairs. They also occur in quasipalindromic DNA sequences, which have been implicated in mutagenesis {{where there are no}} repeated base pairs, through the formation of single-stranded hairpin loops. The conformation of unpaired bases in DNA {{has been the subject of}} numerous thermodynamic as well as high resolution NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) studies (reviewed in ref. 4). The NMR studies in solution have shown that the duplex of the tridecamer DNA fragment d(CGCAGAATTCGCG) remains intact, and that the unpaired <b>adenosines</b> are stacked into the duplex. Having crystallized this oligonucleotide and determined its structure, we find its conformation in the crystal is close to that of a B-DNA duplex, with the two additional <b>adenosines</b> looped out from the double helix and causing little disruption of the rest of the structure...|$|R
40|$|SummaryMany {{steps in}} nuclear RNA processing, surveillance, and {{degradation}} require TRAMP, a complex containing the poly(A) polymerase Trf 4 p, the Zn-knuckle protein Air 2 p, and the RNA helicase Mtr 4 p. TRAMP polyadenylates RNAs designated for decay or trimming by the nuclear exosome. It has been unclear how polyadenylation by TRAMP differs from polyadenylation by conventional poly(A) polymerase, which produces poly(A) tails that stabilize RNAs. Using reconstituted S.  cerevisiae TRAMP, {{we show that}} TRAMP inherently suppresses poly(A) addition after only 3 – 4 <b>adenosines.</b> This poly(A) tail length restriction is controlled by Mtr 4 p. The helicase detects the number of 3 ′-terminal <b>adenosines</b> and, over several adenylation steps, elicits precisely tuned adjustments of ATP affinities and rate constants for adenylation and TRAMP dissociation. Our data establish Mtr 4 p as a critical regulator of polyadenylation by TRAMP and reveal that an RNA helicase can control the activity of another enzyme in a highly complex fashion {{and in response to}} features in RNA...|$|R
40|$|Non-paired {{nucleotides}} {{stabilize the}} formation of three-way helical DNA junctions. Two or more unpaired nucleotides located in the junction region enable oligomers ten to fifteen nucleotides long to assemble, forming conformationally homogeneous junctions, as judged by native gel electrophoresis. The unpaired bases can be present on the same strand or on two different strands. Up to five extra bases on one strand have been tested and found to produce stable junctions. The formation of stable structures is favored {{by the presence of}} a divalent cation such as magnesium and by high monovalent salt concentration. The order-disorder transition of representative three-way junctions was monitored optically in the ultraviolet and analyzed to quantify thermodynamically the stabilization provided by unpaired bases in the junction region. We report the first measurements of the thermodynamics of adding an unpaired nucleotide to a nucleic acid three-way junction. We find that AAG°(37 °C) = + 0. 5 kcal/mol for increasing the number of unpaired <b>adenosines</b> from two to three. Three-way junctions having reporter arms 40 base-pairs long were also prepared. Each of the three reporter arms contained a unique restriction site 15 base-pairs from the junction. Asymmetric complexes produced by selectively cleaving each arm were analyzed on native gels. Cleavage of the double helical arm opposite the strand having the two extra <b>adenosines</b> resulted in a complex that migrated more slowly than complexes produced by cleavage at either of the other two arms. It is likely that the strand containing the unpaired <b>adenosines</b> is kinked at an acute angle, forming a Y-shaped, rather than a T-shaped junction...|$|R
5|$|In some species, the {{luciferase}} requires other cofactors such as calcium or magnesium ions, {{and sometimes}} also the energy-carrying molecule <b>adenosine</b> triphosphate (ATP). In evolution, luciferins vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, {{is found in}} eleven different animal (phyla), though in some of these, the animals obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferases vary widely between different species, and consequently bioluminescence has arisen over forty times in evolutionary history.|$|E
5|$|Metformin {{decreases}} {{high blood}} sugar, primarily by suppressing liver glucose production (hepatic gluconeogenesis). The average patient with {{type 2 diabetes}} has three times the normal rate of gluconeogenesis; metformin treatment reduces this by over one-third. The molecular mechanism of metformin is incompletely understood. Multiple potential mechanisms of action have been proposed, including; inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex I), activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibition of glucagon-induced elevation of cyclic <b>adenosine</b> monophosphate (cAMP) with reduced activation of protein kinase A (PKA), inhibition of mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, and an effect on gut microbiota.|$|E
5|$|One central {{coenzyme}} is <b>adenosine</b> triphosphate (ATP), {{the universal}} energy currency of cells. This nucleotide {{is used to}} transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions. There {{is only a small}} amount of ATP in cells, but as it is continuously regenerated, the human body can use about its own weight in ATP per day. ATP acts as a bridge between catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism breaks down molecules, and anabolism puts them together. Catabolic reactions generate ATP, and anabolic reactions consume it. It also serves as a carrier of phosphate groups in phosphorylation reactions.|$|E

5|$|Other NAD-dependent enzymes include {{bacterial}} DNA ligases, which join two DNA ends {{by using}} NAD {{as a substrate}} to donate an <b>adenosine</b> monophosphate (AMP) moiety to the 5' phosphate of one DNA end. This intermediate is then attacked by the 3' hydroxyl group of the other DNA end, forming a new phosphodiester bond. This contrasts with eukaryotic DNA ligases, which use ATP to form the DNA-AMP intermediate.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} (or OXPHOS in short) is {{the metabolic}} pathway in which cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients, thereby releasing energy {{which is used}} to produce <b>adenosine</b> triphosphate (ATP). In most eukaryotes, this takes place inside mitochondria. Almost all aerobic organisms carry out oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway is probably so pervasive because it is a highly efficient way of releasing energy, compared to alternative fermentation processes such as anaerobic glycolysis.|$|E
5|$|Polyadenylation is the {{addition}} of a poly(A) tail to a messenger RNA. The poly(A) tail consists of multiple <b>adenosine</b> monophosphates; in other words, it is a stretch of RNA that has only adenine bases. In eukaryotes, polyadenylation is part of the process that produces mature messenger RNA (mRNA) for translation. It, therefore, forms part of the larger process of gene expression.|$|E
40|$|The ADAR {{family of}} RNA-editing enzymes deaminates <b>adenosines</b> within RNA that is {{completely}} or largely double stranded. In mammals, most of the characterized substrates encode receptors involved in neurotransmission, and these substrates {{are thought to be}} targeted by the mammalian enzymes ADAR 1 and ADAR 2. Although some ADAR substrates are deaminated very promiscuously, mammalian glutamate receptor B (gluR-B) pre-mRNA is deaminated at a few specific <b>adenosines.</b> Like most double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding proteins, ADARs bind to many different sequences, but few studies have directly measured and compared binding affinities. We have attempted to determine if ADAR deamination specificity occurs because the enzymes bind to targeted regions with higher affinities. To explore this question we studied binding of rat ADAR 2 to a region of rat gluR-B pre-mRNA that contains the R/G editing site, and compared a wild-type molecule with one containing mutations that decreased R/G site editing. Although binding affinity to the two sequences was almost identical, footprinting studies indicate ADAR 2 binds to the wild-type RNA at a discrete region surrounding the editing site, whereas binding to the mutant appeared nonspecific...|$|R
50|$|Originally {{discovered}} in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the TRAMP complex trims the poly(A) tails of RNAs destined for Rrp6 and the core exosome down to 4-5 <b>adenosines,</b> assisting in transcript recognition and exosome complex activation.

50|$|The {{secondary}} structure of 5S rRNA consists of five helices (denoted I-V in roman numerals), four loops (B-E), and one hinge (A), which form together a Y-like structure.

Helix III includes two highly conserved <b>adenosines.</b> Helix V, with its hairpin structure, {{is thought to}} interact with TFIIIA.|$|R
5|$|Pumping protons {{out of the}} {{mitochondria}} {{creates a}} proton concentration difference across the membrane and generates an electrochemical gradient. This force drives protons back into the mitochondrion through the base of an enzyme called ATP synthase. The flow of protons makes the stalk subunit rotate, causing the active site of the synthase domain to change shape and phosphorylate <b>adenosine</b> diphosphate– turning it into ATP.|$|E
5|$|The {{benzodiazepine}} {{class of}} drugs also interact with peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors {{are present in}} peripheral nervous system tissues, glial cells, {{and to a lesser}} extent the central nervous system. These peripheral receptors are not structurally related or coupled to GABAA receptors. They modulate the immune system and are involved in the body response to injury. Benzodiazepines also function as weak <b>adenosine</b> reuptake inhibitors. It has been suggested that some of their anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant effects may be in part mediated by this action.|$|E
5|$|When {{combined}} with oxygen and hydrogen, carbon can form many groups of important biological compounds including sugars, lignans, chitins, alcohols, fats, and aromatic esters, carotenoids and terpenes. With nitrogen it forms alkaloids, {{and with the}} addition of sulfur also it forms antibiotics, amino acids, and rubber products. With the addition of phosphorus to these other elements, it forms DNA and RNA, the chemical-code carriers of life, and <b>adenosine</b> triphosphate (ATP), the most important energy-transfer molecule in all living cells.|$|E

Several regions of high conservation of nucleotide identity are present throughout the RNA motif, and many contain short runs of <b>adenosines.</b>|$|R
40|$|CAG repeats occur {{predominantly}} in {{the coding}} regions of human genes, which suggests their functional importance. In some genes, these sequences can undergo pathogenic expansions leading to neurodegenerative polyglutamine (poly-Q) diseases. The mutant transcripts containing expanded CAG repeats possibly contribute to pathogenesis {{in addition to}} the well-known pathogenic effects of mutant proteins. We have analysed two crystal forms of RNA duplexes containing CAG repeats: (GGCAGCAGCC) 2. One of the structures has been determined at atomic resolution (0. 95 [*]Å) and the other at 1. 9 [*]Å. The duplexes include non-canonical A–A pairs that fit remarkably well within a regular A-helix. All the <b>adenosines</b> are in the anti-conformation and the only interaction within each A–A pair is a single C 2 -H 2 ···N 1 hydrogen bond. Both <b>adenosines</b> in each A–A pair are shifted towards the major groove, although to different extents; the A which is the H-bond donor stands out more (the ‘thumbs-up’ conformation). The main effect on the helix conformation is a local unwinding. The CAG repeats and the previously examined CUG structures share a similar pattern of electrostatic charge distribution in the minor groove, which could explain their affinity for the pathogenesis-related MBNL 1 protein...|$|R
40|$|The Type VI {{secretion}} system (T 6 SS) mediates toxin delivery {{into both}} eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. It {{is composed of}} a cytoplasmic structure resembling the tail of contractile bacteriophages anchored to the cell envelope through a membrane complex composed of the TssL and TssM inner membrane proteins and of the TssJ outer membrane lipoprotein. The C-terminal domain of TssM is required for its interaction with TssJ, and for {{the function of the}} T 6 SS. In Citrobacter rodentium, the tssM 1 gene does not encode the C-terminal domain.
