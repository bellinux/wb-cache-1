5|$|British wartime {{participation}} in the Manhattan Project provided a substantial body of expertise that was crucial {{to the success of}} High Explosive Research, the United Kingdom's post-war nuclear weapons programme, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> without important gaps, such as in the field of plutonium metallurgy. The development of the independent British nuclear deterrent led to the Atomic Energy Act being amended in 1958, and to a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.|$|E
5|$|Divalent {{europium}} (Eu2+) {{in small}} amounts is the activator of the bright blue fluorescence of some samples of the mineral fluorite (CaF2). The reduction from Eu3+ to Eu2+ is induced by irradiation with energetic particles. The most outstanding examples of this originated around Weardale and adjacent parts of northern England; it was the fluorite found here that fluorescence was named after in 1852, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> until much later that europium {{was determined to be}} the cause.|$|E

Three varieties of Linseed were trialled: Riga Crown, an early maturing variety, Italian also early maturing and Walsh, a mid-season maturing variety. It was discovered that all were susceptible to cutworm with greater damage occurring later in the season; early trails of the insecticide DDT was said to show promising results in combating this.|$|E
