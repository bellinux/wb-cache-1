5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression, Edwards found himself unemployed, before gaining a job with a horse racing stable in Fremantle. His {{position}} entailed him taking the horses to the beach each morning for a swim, grooming them, and attending the twice weekly race meetings; a lifelong interest in horse racing consequently emerged at this time. After later working for a brief period in a factory, he enlisted in the Australian Army in March 1934 and was posted to the 6th Heavy Battery, Royal Australian Artillery, with the rank of private. During this period, Edwards was an active sportsman, excelling in Australian rules football—where he played six matches with leading Western <b>Australian</b> <b>Football</b> <b>League</b> (WAFL) club South Fremantle—and cricket with the Fremantle garrison team.|$|E

Hall started the 2004 season playing as a forward and, despite moving into the midfield by mid-season, he was still a regular goalkicker. In June he was named in the VFL representative squad to play against the West <b>Australian</b> <b>Football</b> <b>League,</b> but he missed out on the match due to a hip flexor injury that sidelined him for a month.
