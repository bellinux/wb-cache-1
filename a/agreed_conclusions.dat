5000|$|The {{composition}} of the Council was also subject to controversy. Kass was accused of [...] "stacking the deck" [...] with philosophers, scientists, and public intellectuals likely to oppose [...] "unfettered medical {{research in the area}} of stem cells, therapeutic cloning, and reproductive cloning. Given that fact, researchers had better worry a lot about what the Council is likely to recommend to the president." [...] Critics also charged that Kass eliminated those who disagreed with him, such as Elizabeth Blackburn and William May, and replacing them with opponents of cloning. Kass replied to these criticisms by saying that the Council was more intellectually diverse than prior bioethics commissions precisely because it included opponents of abortion. (Previous commissions had [...] "excluded representatives of the right to life movement.") Also, the council members Robert George, Francis Fukuyama and James Q. Wilson debated with stark disagreement their opposing points of view on the biological status of the human embryo and came to no <b>agreed</b> <b>conclusions.</b> [...] Since Bush had deliberately created the Council to debate and clarify the issues without necessarily reaching consensus, Kass said that he welcomed disagreement within the Council: [...] "This council is easily the most intellectually and ethically diverse of the bioethics commissions to date. We have worked with mutual respect while not papering over our differences. No one who has attended any of our meetings or read the transcripts can believe that we do anything but serious and careful work, without regard to ideology, partisan politics or religious beliefs." ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Improvements {{in quality}} of life, tremor, and other motor {{features}} {{have been recognized}} as superior in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD) treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery versus best medical therapy. We studied a group of patients with PD after undergoing DBS surgery in regard to expectations and satisfaction with DBS outcomes to determine gaps in patient education. Methods. This study was a retrospective, single academic center chart review and outcome questionnaire sent to patients with PD who had undergone DBS surgery between 2007 and 2014. Results. All patients surveyed indicated that benefit from DBS surgery met their overall expectations at least partially, but only 46. 4 % (SE: 9. 6 %) were in complete agreement. 3. 6 % (SE: 3. 6 %) of participants strongly disagreed that preoperative education prepared them adequately for the procedure and 17. 9 % (SE: 7. 4 %) only somewhat <b>agreed.</b> <b>Conclusions.</b> Our findings demonstrate that patients’ expectations of DBS surgery in PD were at least partially met. However, there was a considerable percentage of patients who did not feel adequately prepared for the procedure. A structured, multidisciplinary team approach in educating PD patients throughout the different stages of DBS surgery may be helpful in optimizing patients’ experience and satisfaction with surgery outcomes...|$|E
40|$|In March 2009 Member States of the United Nations met in New York at the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) to discuss, {{among other}} things, the {{priority}} theme of “The equal sharing of responsibilities {{between women and}} men, including care-giving {{in the context of}} HIV/AIDS”. This meeting provided an unprecedented opportunity to focus the international community’s attention on care issues and to generate <b>Agreed</b> <b>Conclusions</b> that would lay out a roadmap for care policy, potentially influencing national legislation, policies adopted by UN entities and future international agreements. Using interviews with participants and an overview of official documentation, this paper seeks to summarize the achievements of the 2009 CSW, and to suggest where policy conversations about care might usefully focus next. More specifically, the paper aims to contribute to three key objectives: (i) identify the narrative(s) of how the policy frame of equal sharing of responsibilities, including care-giving in the context of HIV/AIDS, came into being; (ii) identify the policy alliances generated through that frame; and (iii) identify the key achievements forged at the 53 rd session, while examining what the <b>Agreed</b> <b>Conclusions</b> might make possible to say and do around care issues in the future. In this way it aims to provide a supportive and critical examination of the emerging global policy agenda on care issues as crystallized in the meetings around the 2009 CSW. With regard to the achievements, the paper argues that the frame of care, linked as it was to the equal sharing of responsibility between men and women, proved an exceptionally expansive one. It successfully united a wide range of actors, including conservative faith-based actors who had mobilized against other gender equality initiatives in the past. This expansive frame facilitated three key advances in care policy at the 53 rd session: (i) consensus among Member States and other actors on the significance of care across the UN system, especially in relation to HIV; (ii) consensus on a strong state responsibility; and (iii) consensus on the centrality of care-givers’ participation in debates over policy. These advances may prove significant in increasing attention to care within the United Nations, defending care services from state cutbacks in a recession, and helping civil society actors mobilize around care, especially as related to HIV. In addition, the agreements made at the 2009 CSW may represent {{the emergence of a new}} consensus around the importance of economic justice issues in gender equality venues, given the foregrounding of state services and the challenge to free-market models of growth witnessed there. In an attempt to consider where care conversations might usefully focus next, the paper closes with a discussion of two issues that received less attention at the 2009 CSW: disability and diversity of family formation. These two issues are highly relevant to care debates, at the UN level and elsewhere, and can help move global policy forward in fruitful directions. That said, policy conversations will need to be reframed to take them into account. This task will in some ways challenge the consensus on care forged at the 2009 CSW. For example, the progress made in carrying forward the global gender equality project via a unifying focus on care is in part based on a consensus about care-givers as the central actors, a position challenged by disability activism and scholarship. Likewise, the agreements forged at the 2009 CSW in many ways entrenched the notion that privatized nuclear family units were a universally desirable model for care provision, a notion challenged by a range of actors who recognize the role of extended family members in care, and/or who want to secure more support for the diverse forms through which care is provided. A reframing of care debates will be necessary if new alliances with such actors are to be forged and strengthened. While the paper seeks to explicate the immense value of the <b>Agreed</b> <b>Conclusions</b> forged at the 2009 CSW for future efforts to secure care services, it also aims to explore the limitations of those agreements and highlight the importance of continuing the conversation on care to grapple with current exclusions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{sheer number}} and {{complexity}} of biophysical and socio-economic models and their outputs can quickly overwhelm stakeholders {{who are trying to}} make sense of a natural resource-related issue. Add uncertainty to this bulk of multi-faceted information from risk analyses and the justification for selecting a course of action becomes an even more daunting endeavour. Decision and policy makers have to combine model outputs with a variety of other information sources in order to make difficult trade-offs between often conflicting investment options. A transparent and flexible decision facilitation process is required to help assimilate complex model outputs and other information within the context of policy considerations and guide decision-makers toward <b>agreed</b> <b>conclusions</b> on the issue at hand. To aid stakeholders in the prioritization of biosecurity risk investment options, we provide information on invasive pest risk including a bio-economic pest impact model, socio-economic activity and ecological impacts. The specialized nature of the information, such as pest impact models, inevitably reach beyond the expertise of a participant group comprised of the public or a policy-making group, thus requiring decision support in the form of interpreting key findings and the corresponding uncertainty. The bio-economic model makes predictions concerning the costs incurred by the industry if the pest becomes part of the production scheme. The model has an associated sensitivity analysis that presents the full range of uncertaint...|$|E
40|$|Objectives To define {{standardised}} endpoints to aid {{the design}} of trials that compare antibiotic therapies for bloodstream infection (BSI). Methods Prospective studies, randomised trials or registered protocols comparing antibiotic therapies for BSI, published from 2005 to 2016, were reviewed. Consensus endpoints for BSI studies were defined using a modified Delphi process. Results Different primary and secondary endpoints were defined for pilot (small-scale studies designed to evaluate protocol design, feasibility and implementation) and definitive trials (larger-scale studies designed to test hypotheses and influence clinical practice), {{as well as for}} Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative BSI. For pilot studies of S. aureus BSI, a primary outcome of success at day 7 was defined by: survival, resolution of fever, stable/improved Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and clearance of blood cultures, with no microbiologically-confirmed failure up to 90 days. For definitive S. aureus BSI studies, a primary outcome of success at 90 days was defined by survival and no microbiologically-confirmed failure. For pilot studies of Gram-negative BSI, a primary outcome of success at day 7 was defined by: survival, resolution of fever and symptoms related to BSI source, stable or improved SOFA score and negative blood cultures. For definitive Gram-negative BSI studies, a primary outcome of survival at 90 days supported by a secondary outcome of success at day 7 (as previously defined) was <b>agreed.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> These endpoints provide a framework to aid future trial design. Further work will be required to validate these endpoints with respect to patient-centered clinical outcomes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Osteoarthritis is {{a common}} {{presentation}} in primary care, and non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (sometimes {{also referred to as}} traditional NSAIDs or tNSAIDs) and selective cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitors (COX- 2 inhibitors) are commonly used to treat it. The UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends taking patient risk factors into account when selecting a tNSAID or a COX- 2 inhibitor, but GPs have lacked practical guidance on assessing patient risk. Methods A multi-disciplinary group that included primary care professionals (PCPs) developed an evidence-based consensus statement with an accompanying flowchart that aimed at providing concise and specific guidance on NSAID use in osteoarthritis treatment. An open invitation to meet and discuss the issue was made to relevant healthcare professionals in South Yorkshire. A round table meeting was held that used a modified nominal group technique, aimed at generating opinions and ideas from all stakeholders in the consensus process. A draft developed from this meeting went through successive revisions until a consensus was achieved. Results Four statements on the use of tNSAIDs and COX- 2 inhibitors (and an attached category of evidence) were agreed: 1) tNSAIDs are effective drugs in relieving pain and immobility associated with osteoarthritis. COX- 2 inhibitors are equally effective; 2) tNSAIDs and COX- 2 inhibitors vary in their potential gastrointestinal, liver, and cardio-renal toxicity. This risk varies between individual treatments within both groups and is increased with dose and duration of treatment; 3) COX- 2 inhibitors are associated with a significantly lower gastrointestinal toxicity compared to tNSAIDs. Co-prescribing of aspirin reduces this advantage; 4) PPIs should always be considered with a tNSAID and with a COX- 2 inhibitor in higher GI risk patients. An accompanying flowchart to guide management was also <b>agreed.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> Individual patient risk {{is an important factor in}} choice of treatment for patients with osteoarthritis and the consensus statement developed offers practical guidance for GPs and others in primary care. Where there are clinical uncertainties, guidance developed and agreed by local clinicians has a role to play in improving patient management. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background. As they guide {{people in}} {{performing}} a task, procedures are {{the heart of}} most manuals. It is, therefore, somewhat surprising that the theoretical and empirical knowledge of their nature has remained somewhat elusive. This paper describes a theoretical framework for procedures, summarized as the four components model, which is grounded in systems theory and rhetoric. Aim. The study addresses two research questions: (1) What are procedures made of? and (2) Which design guidelines for procedures can be abstracted from theory and research? Results. The model distinguishes between: goals, prerequisite states, unwanted states (warnings and problem-solving information), and actions and reactions. For each component pertinent research findings are summarized and lead to the formulation of design guidelines. Occasionally these guidelines are compared with existing procedures from a sample of 104 manuals {{to see how well}} theory and practice <b>agree.</b> <b>Conclusion.</b> The model offers a manageable and expandable framework for creating user support that is based on scientific research.

40|$|A joint ANSTO/CSIRO seminar {{was held}} at Lucas Heights on 10 - 11 th April 1996. Its aim was to {{describe}} {{the current state of}} research and assessment capabilities within the scientific research organisations, to identify the gaps in these capabilities and to determine the opportunities for collaborative research. The seminar took the form of invited presentations outlining the work of each agency, together with case studies which presented an application of the ecological risk assessment process. The seminar provided a timely opportunity for discussion of scientific capabilities and collaboration in ecological risk assessment. The issue is currently being debated within the organisations represented and within the community. The contributions of the speakers were of a high standard and evoked significant discussion {{of a wide range of}} issues. All participants expressed a desire to continue the exchange of information and discussion of ongoing work. There was positive and enthusiastic support for the need to develop better mechanisms for collaborating in research and in establishing co-ordination of activities in this area. The <b>agreed</b> <b>conclusions</b> of the seminar were: 1. There is an urgent need to develop a national framework for ecological risk management and protocols for undertaking the various assessment stages within the framework. 2. An ecological database should be made a high priority by all the agencies. 3. A national communication network should be established as soon as possible to allow information exchange and co-ordination of activities. Tom Beer undertook to see if the CSIRO network system could be made available to a wider range of agencies. In the medium to longer term, there was considered to be great value in establishing a national co-ordination centre for ecological risk, which would be separately but jointly funded by the agencies and industry. 4. In the short term, a list of capabilities among the agencies should be established. This should also indicate contact people for the various topics. 5. A National Case Study was considered to be important in giving focus to the development of methods and in allowing collaboration on a well-defined project. 6. A Task Group was proposed to progress these issues and the various recommendations of the working groups. 7.

40|$|To gauge {{consensus}} {{regarding a}} proposed definition for refractory migraine proposed by Refractory Headache Special Interest Section, and where its use {{would be most}} appropriate. Background. — Headache experts have long recognized that a subgroup of headache sufferers remains refractory to treatment. Although different groups have proposed criteria to define refractory migraine, the definition remains controversial. The Refractory Headache Special Interest Section of the American Headache Society developed a definition through a consensus process, assisted by a literature review and initial membership survey. Design. — A 12 -item questionnaire was distributed at the American Headache Society meeting in 2007 during a platform session and at the Refractory Headache Special Interest Section symposium. The same questionnaire was subsequently sent to all American Headache Society members via e-mail. A total of 151 responses from AHS members {{form the basis of}} this report. The survey instrument was designed using Survey Monkey. Frequencies and percentages of the survey were used to describe survey responses. Results. — American Headache Society members agreed that a definition for refractory migraine is needed (91 %) that it should be added to the International Classification of Headache Disorders- 2 (86 %), and that refractory forms of non-migraine headache disorders should be defined (87 %). Responders believed a refractory migraine definition would be of greatest value in selecting patients for clinical drug trials. The current refractory migraine definition requires a diagnosis of migraine, interference with function or quality of life despite modification of lifestyle factors, and adequate trials of acute and preventive medicines with established efficacy. The proposed criteria for the refractory migraine definition require failing 2 preventive medications to meet the threshold for failure. Although 42 % of respondents agreed with the working definition of refractory migraine, 43 % favored increasing the number to 3 (50 %) or 4 (26 %) preventive treatment failures. When respondents were asked if they felt that the proposed definition was appropriate to select patients for invasive procedures (patent foramen ovale repair or stimulators) only 44 % <b>agreed.</b> <b>Conclusions.</b> — There is a consensus for a need for a definition for refractory migraine and that it should be added to the International Classification of Headache Disorder- 2.

40|$|Background The {{design of}} {{environments in which}} people with {{dementia}} live should be understandable, reinforce personal identity and maintain their abilities. The focus on supporting people with dementia to live well has omitted considering the needs or wishes for a supportive physical environment {{of those who are}} nearing the end of their lives. Using a combination of focus groups and a Delphi survey, this study explored the views of people with dementia, family carers and professionals on what aspects of the physical environment would be important to support a good quality of life to the very end. Methods Three focus groups were carried out in three cities along the East Coast of Australia using a discussion guide informed by a literature review. Focus groups comprised recently bereaved family carers of people with dementia (FG 1), people with dementia and family carers of people with dementia (FG 2) and practitioners caring for people with dementia nearing or {{at the end of their}} lives (FG 3). Focus group conversations were audio-recorded with participants 2 ̆ 7 consent. Audio files were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically to identify environmental features that could contribute to achieving the goal of providing a comfortable life to the end. A list of design features derived from analysis of focus group transcripts was distributed to a range of experts in the dementia field and a consensus sought on their appropriateness. From this, a set of features to inform the design of environments for people with dementia nearing the end of life was defined. Results Eighteen people took part in three focus groups: two with dementia, eleven current or recently bereaved family carers and five practitioners. There were differences in opinion on what were important environmental considerations. People with dementia and family carers identified comfort through engagement, feeling at home, a calm environment, privacy and dignity and use of technology to remain connected as important. For practitioners, design to facilitate duty of care and institutional influences on their practice were salient themes. Twenty one experts in the dementia field took part in the survey to agree a consensus on the desirable features derived from analysis of focus group transcripts, with fifteen features <b>agreed.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> The fifteen features are compatible with the design principles for people with dementia who are mobile, but include a stronger focus on sensory engagement. We suggest that considering these features as part of a continuum of care will support good practice and offer those with dementia the opportunity to live well until the end and give their families a more positive experience in the last days of their lives together...|$|E
