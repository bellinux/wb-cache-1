Therefore, we have developed an experimental system in which the distance between the avatars can be changed by the users during a chat, and performed the experiment. As a result of the experiment, the tendency personal space in virtual space is similar to the personal space in real space. However personal space varies depending on the relationship with the partner in the face-to-face communication, it doesn’t tend to vary in the virtual space using the proposed system...|$|R
