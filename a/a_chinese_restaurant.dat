5|$|Marquis' {{interest}} in the West was first sparked in 1890 by stories from three fellow printers who had spent a year there. Marquis and a colleague at the Herald resolved to save for a similar trip, working every shift available. In the end, however, the other printer dropped out and Marquis went alone. He boarded a train for Helena, Montana, on July23, 1890, arriving on the 27th. He soon found temporary work at the Helena Independent-Record. It was in Helena that Marquis first met Native Americans. Perhaps more remarkably, {{it was there that}} he first experienced <b>a</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>restaurant.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sun and Hendra run <b>a</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>restaurant</b> {{that serves}} pork, which is {{forbidden}} for Muslims, although the restaurant has many Muslim clients and staff. To ensure {{good relations with}} his Muslim employees and customers, Sun uses special utensils for the preparation of pork, which he does not permit {{to be used for}} other dishes, and allows his staff time for prayers; he also gives them a holiday during Eid ul-Fitr, the largest Muslim holiday. One of his employees is Menuk, who supports her unemployed husband, Soleh. Rika is Menuk's friend and is involved with the unsuccessful Muslim actor Surya (Agus Kuncoro).|$|E
5|$|Following {{the grand}} opening, the theatre {{served as a}} venue for {{vaudeville}} and film, and following the decline of vaudeville as a movie palace until the 1970s. With the economic recession, the advent of television, and movie complex development in the suburbs, crowds dwindled and the theatre struggled to stay open. It was forced to close its doors in 1978 along with the nearby Orpheum theatre. A variety of re-use possibilities were proposed for the theatre including <b>a</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>restaurant,</b> a triplex movie theater, an office building, or a shopping center. The city of Seattle was unable to protect the theatre as a designated landmark because of its unique position {{on the site of}} the original territorial university grounds owned by the state of Washington.|$|E

5|$|The basic plot of Bruce Lee Way of the Dragon (1972) {{was adapted}} by Varma for Siva. In Way of the Dragon, Lee comes from Hong Kong {{to work in}} <b>a</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>restaurant</b> in Rome and fights local gangsters who try to intimidate the owners; {{this leads to a}} rivalry with a crime boss (played by Chuck Norris). In Siva, Nagarjuna comes from a nearby town to Vijayawada to further his education, fights gangsters and {{develops}} a rivalry with Raghuvaran. While Lee and Norris fight at the Colosseum at the climax of Way of the Dragon, Nagarjuna and Raghuvaran duel on a building terrace in Siva.|$|E
5|$|The {{intersection}} of 7th Street NW and H Street NW {{is the heart}} of D.C.'s Chinatown neighborhood today, but prior to the 1930s it was populated primarily by German immigrants. Before the American Civil War, 7th Street NW was the city's primary commercial district, the street lined with three-story Federal-style townhouses with shops on the ground floor and residences above. Lincoln conspirator Mary Surratt's boarding house (604 H Street NW) has been substantially renovated through the years (and currently houses <b>a</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>restaurant),</b> but it may also house Mary Surratt's ghost. From the 1870s onward, occupants of the building have claimed that Surratt's spirit is responsible for the incomprehensible mumbling and whispers, footsteps, muffled sobs, and creaking floorboards which have unnerved them.|$|E
5|$|During his career, Russell {{was one of}} {{the first}} big earners in NBA basketball. His 1956 rookie {{contract}} was worth $24,000, only fractionally smaller than the $25,000 of top earner Bob Cousy. In contrast to other Celtics, who had to work in the offseason to maintain their standard of living (Heinsohn sold insurance, Gene Guarilia was a professional guitar player, Cousy ran a basketball camp, and Auerbach invested in plastics and <b>a</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>restaurant),</b> Russell never had to work part-time. When Wilt Chamberlain became the first NBA player to earn $100,000 in salary in 1965, Russell went to Auerbach and demanded a $100,001 salary, which he promptly received. For his promotion to coach the Celtics paid Russell an annual salary of $25,000 which was in addition to his salary as a player; although the salary was touted in the press as a record for an NBA coach, it is unclear whether Russell's continued $100,001 salary as a player was included in the calculation.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} two days of 1999, Los Angeles has become a {{dangerous}} war zone. As a group of criminals rob <b>a</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>restaurant,</b> the event is recorded by a robber wearing a SQUID, an illegal electronic device that records events directly from the wearer's cerebral cortex, and when played back through a MiniDisc-like device, allows a user to experience the recorder's memories and physical sensations. Lenny Nero, a former LAPD officer turned black marketeer of SQUID recordings, agrees to buy the robbery clip from his main supplier, Tick. Elsewhere, a prostitute named Iris, who is a friend of Lenny's ex-girlfriend Faith Justin, is being chased by LAPD officers Burton Steckler and Dwayne Engelman as she flees to the subway. Iris manages to escape on a rapid transit after her wig is pulled off by Engleman, revealing a SQUID recorder headset.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Madonna {{coming to a}} ballet studio {{carrying}} a boombox. She switches it on as the clock ticking sound of the music starts. Wearing a pink leotard, Madonna starts gyrating to the music while doing warm up exercises. The scene interchanges {{with a group of}} people on the street who start dancing to the music while listening to a similar boombox. They also display aspects of the physical discipline Parkour, while climbing over buildings and jumping from staircases. As the song starts, Madonna dances to the music in the ballet studio. The second verse shows her continuing dancing while the people from the street take their boombox and board a taxi. Scenes are interspersed with people dancing in <b>a</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>restaurant</b> and Parisian streets. In the meantime, Madonna finishes her workout in the ballet studio, drops her towel, changes her clothes and comes out on the street. The people on the taxi, leave it and take the Underground instead. After another round of dancing in the train, the intermediate music starts. Madonna is shown mingling with some dancers on a dance floor and riding on a boombox. As the song starts again, Madonna and the people from the street, who act as her background dancers, all dance on a Dance Dance Revolution machine in a gaming parlor. The video ends showing Madonna lying on the ballet studio floor. The video was nominated for five awards at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards including Best Female Video, Dance Video, Pop Video, Best Choreography and the Video of the Year award although it did not win any of them.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{his more}} notable oddities {{included}} a diet to supplement his extreme fitness regime, which consisted largely of tea, biscuits, and baked beans. Like his mentor, Alan Knott, a heavy tea drinker, Russell would often get through 20 cups a day. He used to dip the tea bag in once, add plenty of milk, then hang it on a nail ready for subsequent use. In the final Test of the 1989 Ashes series (against Australia) at the Oval, Derek Randall counted that he used the same bag for all five days, which roughly equates to 100 cups. For lunch, Russell would eat two Weetabix, soaked for exactly eight minutes in milk, and a mashed banana. For dinner, steak and chips or chicken without skin was a favourite meal – Russell once spent every night of a Test at <b>a</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>restaurant</b> in Perth, ordering cashew chicken: without the cashews.|$|E
