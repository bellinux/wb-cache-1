50|$|Because <b>a</b> <b>bonus</b> <b>issue</b> {{does not}} {{represent}} an economic event - no wealth changes hands. The current shareholders simply receive new shares, for free, and in proportion to their previous share in the company. Therefore, <b>a</b> <b>bonus</b> share <b>issue</b> {{is very similar to}} a stock split. The only practical difference is that <b>a</b> <b>bonus</b> <b>issue</b> creates <b>a</b> change {{in the structure of the}} company's shareholders' equity (in accounting). Another difference between <b>a</b> <b>bonus</b> <b>issue</b> and <b>a</b> stock split is that while a stock split usually also splits the company's authorized share capital, the distribution of bonus shares only changes its issued share capital (or even only its outstanding shares).|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>bonus</b> <b>issue</b> {{is usually}} {{based upon the}} number of shares that {{shareholders}} already own. [...] (For example, the <b>bonus</b> <b>issue</b> may be [...] "n shares for each x shares held"; but with fractions of a share not permitted.) While the <b>issue</b> of <b>bonus</b> shares increases {{the total number of}} shares issued and owned, it does not change the value of the company. Although the total number of issued shares increases, the ratio of number of shares held by each shareholder remains constant. In this sense, <b>a</b> <b>bonus</b> <b>issue</b> is similar to a stock split.|$|R

40|$|In 1996, Australia's CRA and UK's RTZ merged to {{form the}} world's largest mining company, but the {{companies}} remained separately listed on their domestic exchanges. In order to equalize {{the price of the}} two companies' shares, before the dual listing, CRA made <b>a</b> <b>bonus</b> <b>issue.</b> Shares in the <b>bonus</b> <b>issue</b> were not entitled to the next CRA dividend, which carried imputation tax credits. The contemporaneous price differences between the old shares and the bonus shares are used to measure the market value of dividends and associated tax credits. Consistent with imputation tax credits adding value to the dividend, 1 dollar face value of dividends was observed to have a market value significantly greater that its face value. The market value of the dividend varied depending on the proximity of observations to the ex-dividend date. Close to the ex-dividend date, the premium of market value over face value was smaller. The results are consistent with dividend values set by short-term traders about the ex-dividend date and by long-term investors at other times. Copyright (c) 2008 The Authors.

50|$|The {{par value}} of stock has no {{relation}} to market value and, as a concept, is somewhat archaic. The par value of a share is the value stated in the corporate charter below which shares of that class cannot be sold upon initial offering; the issuing company promises not to issue further shares below par value, so investors can be confident {{that no one else}} will receive a more favorable issue price. Thus, par value is the nominal value of a security which is determined by the issuing company to be its minimum price. This was far more important in unregulated equity markets than in the regulated markets that exist today, where a stock issuance prices must usually be published. The par value of stock remains unchanged in <b>a</b> <b>bonus</b> stock <b>issue</b> but it changes in a stock split.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Event study {{analysis}} {{is applied to}} investigate stock price reaction to the announcement of <b>bonus</b> <b>issues</b> for the emerging stock markets of China. Results show that the <b>issues</b> with <b>a</b> high <b>bonus</b> ratio (number of bonus shares in the issue/number of existing shares) usually attract positive returns for both Chinese (A-share traders) and foreign (B-share traders) residents. <b>Issues</b> with <b>a</b> low <b>bonus</b> ratio are rewarded with negative returns for A-share traders and do not stimulate significant activity by B-share traders. The hypothesis of semi-strong form market efficiency is rejected only for small-bonus issues traded on the A-share market; the B-share market displays stronger evidence of semi-strong form market efficiency than the A-share market. Finally, {{there appears to be}} additional informational content in the approvals of <b>bonus</b> <b>issues</b> above and beyond that of the proposals, even though most bonus schedules proceed as proposed...|$|R
