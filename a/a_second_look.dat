25|$|In 1861 {{the city}} of Kingston had {{considered}} buying the land around Bishop's Falls near Ashokan to dam and use as a reservoir. It dropped the idea quickly since the creek's waters were still fouled by tanning effluents.

25|$|The {{son of the}} rector of Dallinghoo, Walford {{was educated}} at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a middle- or lower-order batsman, {{though it is not}} known whether he batted right- or left-handed. His two {{first-class}} matches came within a fortnight of each other in May 1860. In the first, scores of 7 and 25 for the Cambridge University team against the Cambridge Town Club were enough for the university team to want to take <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>look</b> at him, and he was duly picked for the MCC team to play against the university, a frequent ploy in university cricket at the time, but then failed to score in his only innings. Although he played in minor matches for the Cambridge team across the rest of the 1860 season, he was not picked for the University Match against Oxford University and played no further first-class games.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE:This {{study was}} {{conducted}} on patients with ovarian cancer in order to evaluate survival. DESIGN: A retrospective study of 119 cases of ovarian cancer from January 1977 to December 1992 with observation until 1993. LOCATION: Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Ribeirão Preto School of Medicine, São Paulo University. PARTICIPANTS: Of the 119 cases, 70 (58. 8 %) presented epithelial carcinomas and 21 (17. 6 %) tumors of the sexual girdle/stroma. DATA SOURCE: The data {{were obtained from the}} medical records of the patients. MEASUREMENT: Statistical analysis of survival time was based on the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test with the level of significance set at P < 0. 05. RESULTS: The patients with <b>a</b> negative <b>second</b> <b>look</b> had <b>a</b> mean survival of 79. 4 ± 48. 5 months versus 24. 2 ± 15. 1 months for patients with <b>a</b> positive <b>second</b> <b>look</b> (P < 0. 02).

Despite {{calling it the}} best Final Fantasy VII spin-off, Eurogamer criticized that [...] "for the twenty-six, twenty-eight, thirty-year-olds who it's aimed at, the game has little to offer beyond polished sentimentality." [...] Although PALGN called the DMW system a [...] "handy tool", they also felt it was the game's weakest point. X-Play gave the game a 2/5, complaining about the unskippable cutscenes, poor dialogue, repetitive gameplay, and a weak plot. On April Fools' Day, in response to criticism for their original review, they [...] "decided to give the game <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>look</b> {{and give it a}} re-review, this time with a clear unbiased perspective," [...] sarcastically dubbing over the original and giving it an impossibly high 6/5.|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} been {{considered}} a cult classic. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an average score of 71%, based on 17 critic reviews.

[...] Leonard Klady of The New York Times wrote that the film [...] "demonstrates both above-average technical skill and large dollops of imagination". Film critic Leonard Maltin initially declared the film a BOMB ("Strictly tenth-rate."), but gave the movie <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>look</b> after a few years; this time, Maltin awarded the picture two-and-a-half out of a possible four stars.

500|$|Billboard {{magazine}} called the song [...] "a Pussycat Dolls-inspired contempo jam, high on hooks and of-the-moment production. Well done, {{if in the}} most generic sense." [...] About.com's Bill Lamb gave the song 4/5 stars, saying that with [...] "Say It Right", [...] "many pop music fans are likely to take <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>look</b> at purchasing [...] ". He described the song as [...] "the foundation of Loose" [...] and [...] "a welcomed presence in the pop top 40". IGN Music calls the song [...] "...one of the brightest moments on the album" [...] and [...] "another throwback to the '80s" [...] which [...] "...lets loose with the most hypnotic chorus". Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered the song [...] "a dark meditative piece that would have fit on [...] previous records". The New York Times described the song as [...] "building a groove from hard drums and ghostly, multitracked voices, and Ms. Furtado sings a melancholy chorus she doesn't quite believe", comparing the coda, with music getting louder and then slowly fading, [...] "the way the best — and worst — nights out often do". Also, DJ Z's reviewed the song as [...] "the only single {{in the world to}} work at both a club in Manhattan, and on a safari through the natives land of (fill in the blank)."

500|$|Munsey's {{plan for}} the {{magazines}} was {{laid out in a}} note that appeared in the first four issues: [...] "This magazine is the answer to thousands of requests we have received over a period of years, demanding <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>look</b> at famous fantasies which, since their original publication, have become accepted classics. [...] Our choice has been dictated by your requests and our firm belief that these are the aces of imaginative fiction." [...] The first issue included Ray Cummings' [...] "The Girl in the Golden Atom" [...] and A. Merritt's [...] "The Moon Pool", both popular stories by well-known authors. [...] Merritt's sequel, [...] "The Conquest of the Moon Pool", began serialization in the next issue, with illustrations by Virgil Finlay. [...] Finlay did many illustrations for Famous Fantastic Mysteries over its lifetime, and became one of its most popular artists. [...] Frank R. Paul began illustrating for the magazine with the third issue; he was not as capable an artist as Finlay but was very popular with the readers. [...] The first five covers were simply tables of contents, but with the sixth issue, dated March 1940, pictorial covers began, with Finlay the artist for that first cover. [...] Three early covers in 1940 were painted by Paul, but thereafter almost every cover was painted by either Finlay, Lawrence Stevens, or his son, Peter Stevens, including every single issue from February 1941 through April 1950. [...] The high quality of the artwork helped make the magazine {{one of the most popular}} of its day, and sf historian Thomas Clareson has suggested that it was Finlay's work in Famous Fantastic Mysteries and Fantastic Novels that made his reputation.|$|E
