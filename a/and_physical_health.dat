5|$|The New Thought movement, {{which emerged}} in the 1880s, was {{responsible}} for popularizing belief {{in the power of}} the mind to achieve prosperity.

By the 20th century, New Thought concepts had saturated American popular culture, being common features of both self-help literature and popular psychology.|$|E

40|$|While {{health is}} defined as ‘a state of {{complete}} <b>physical,</b> mental <b>and</b> social well-being’, <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> mental <b>health</b> have traditionally been separated.

A literature review on why <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> mental <b>health</b> are separated and why these two areas need to be integrated was conducted. A conceptual framework for how to integrate <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> mental <b>health</b> promotion strategies was developed and applied to The Obesity Reduction Strategy for British Columbia.

5|$|Nutrition plays a {{major role}} in and individual’s overall health; {{psychological}} <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>health</b> status is often dramatically impacted by the presence of malnutrition. India currently has one of the highest rates of malnourished women among developing countries. A study in 2000 found that nearly 70 percent of non-pregnant women and 75 percent of pregnant women were anemic in terms of iron-deficiency. One of the main drivers of malnutrition is gender specific selection of the distribution of food resources.|$|E

5|$|When Tennyson {{heard on}} 1 October 1833 of his friend's death, {{he was living}} in Somersby, Lincolnshire, in cramped {{quarters}} with his mother and nine of his ten siblings. His father had died in 1831, requiring Tennyson to return home and take responsibility for the family. Tennyson's friends were becoming increasingly concerned about his mental <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>health</b> during this time. The family had little income, and three of Tennyson's brothers were mentally ill. Just as Tennyson's outlook was improving—he was adjusting to his new domestic duties, regaining contact with friends, and had published his 1832 book of poems—the news of Hallam's death arrived. Tennyson shared his grief with his sister, Emily, who had been engaged to Hallam.|$|E

5|$|Interior Minister Anne Holmlund, who {{had ordered}} the {{original}} investigation into the police officers' conduct in the Kauhajoki incident, said that legislation would be introduced to aid police officers in accessing information about the mental <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>health</b> of applicants for firearms licenses. This included, potentially, the ability to gain detailed information about an applicant's health, the right to subpoena records from the Finnish Social Insurance Institution, {{and the right to}} request further information if the applicant had a history of using medication. In addition to this, Holmlund said that the referencing process for being granted a firearms license would be intensified: two referees would have to be personally interviewed before a license was granted. Holmlund also pointed to legislation of the EU as her starting point. Other reforms, that she said would be introduced as late as spring 2009, included a national register of gun owners. Parliamentary debates occurred on whether to raise the age at which one could own a gun, or whether to put further checks in place, in September 2009.|$|E

40|$|A {{growing body}} of literature, both {{academic}} and in the popular media, has focused on intimate partner violence (IPV) and its consequences. In addition to the acute <b>physical,</b> social, <b>and</b> economic consequence of IPV, IPV clearly causes great stress for IPV women. While research has shown an association between exposure to external stressors <b>and</b> poor chronic <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> mental <b>health,</b> known as the 2 ̆ 2 stress-health hypothesis, 2 ̆ 2 few studies have extrapolated this to examine IPV as a stressor. The goal {{of this research is}} to do just that using preexisting data from the Chicago Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health Risk Study (CWHRS). The CWHRS is a quasi-experimental cross-sectional design conducted from 1997 - 1998. Participants completed an initial interview and then another interview one year later. The interview focused on the respondent 2 ̆ 7 s experiences of IPV as well as self-reported demographic characteristics <b>and</b> self-reported <b>physical</b> <b>health</b> measures. Using descriptive statistics as well as regression and factor analyses, my research tested the associations between IPV <b>and</b> poor <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> mental <b>health.</b> After controlling for known demographic risk factors for IPV <b>and</b> for poor <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> mental <b>health,</b> IPV victimization (controlling for severity) was modeled as a predictor for self-reported health. The results of this study found a relationship between IPV <b>and</b> certain <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> mental <b>health</b> outcomes. In addition, support social support was found to provide a buffering effect between IPV <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> mental <b>health</b> outcomes...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Office-based staff spend {{around three}} {{quarters}} of their work day sitting. People who sit for long periods while at work {{are at greater risk}} of adverse health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The pilot study aimed to determine the effect of sit-stand workstations on office-based staff sedentary <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> activity behaviors, work ability <b>and</b> self-reported <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> mental <b>health</b> outcomes. METHODS: A two-group pre-post study design assessed changes in sedentary <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> activity behaviors (time spent sitting, standing and stepping and sit-stand transitions and number of steps taken) work ability <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> mental <b>health.</b> <b>Physical</b> activity behaviors were measured using activPAL activity monitors and self-reported data on work ability <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> mental <b>health</b> were collected using an online questionnaire. RESULTS: Relative to the controls (n= 19), the intervention group (n= 18) significantly decreased time spent sitting by 100 minutes (p< 0. 001) and increased standing time by 99 minutes (p< 0. 001). There was a decrease in self-reported current work ability when compared to lifetime best (p= 0. 008). There were no significant differences for all other sedentary behavior, other workability outcomes, <b>physical</b> <b>health</b> or mental health outcomes at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The Uprising Study found that sit-stand workstations are an effective strategy to reduce occupational sitting time in office-based workers over a one month period...|$|R
