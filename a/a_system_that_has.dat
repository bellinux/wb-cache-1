5|$|Horseshoe crabs convert {{nitrogenous}} wastes to ammonia {{and dump}} it via their gills, and excrete other wastes as feces via the anus. They also have nephridia ("little kidneys"), which extract other wastes for excretion as urine. Ammonia is so toxic {{that it must}} be diluted rapidly with large quantities of water. Most terrestrial chelicerates cannot afford to use so much water and therefore convert nitrogenous wastes to other chemicals, which they excrete as dry matter. Extraction is by various combinations of nephridia and Malpighian tubules. The tubules filter wastes out of the blood and dump them into the hindgut as solids, <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> evolved independently in insects and several groups of arachnids.|$|E
5|$|Should the {{tropical}} system further intensify and have winds estimated or measured, as greater than 64kn (74mph; 119km/h), {{then it will}} be called a hurricane and classified on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The lowest classification on the SSHWS is a Category 1 hurricane, which has winds of between 64–82kn (74–95mph, 119–153km/h). Should the hurricane intensify further {{then it will be}} rated as a Category 2 hurricane, if it has winds of between 83–95kn (96–110mph, 154–177km/h). When a system becomes a Category 3 hurricane with winds of between 96–112kn (111–129mph, 178–208km/h), it {{is considered to be a}} major hurricane by the warning centers. A Category 4 hurricane has winds of 113–136kn (130–156mph, 209–251km/h), while a Category 5 hurricane has winds of at least 137kn (157mph, 252km/h). A post tropical cyclone is <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> weakened, into a remnant low or has dissipated and formal advisories are usually discontinued at this stage. However, advisories may continue if the post tropical cyclone, poses a significant threat to life and property.

25|$|Since the {{founding}} of the People's Republic, industrial development has been given considerable attention; as of 2011 46% of China's national output continued to be devoted to investment; a percentage far higher than any other nation. Among the various industrial branches the machine-building and metallurgical industries have received the highest priority. These two areas alone now account for about 20–30 percent of the total gross value of industrial output. In these, as in most other areas of industry, however, innovation has generally suffered at the hands of <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> rewarded increases in gross output rather than improvements in variety, sophistication and quality. China, therefore, still imports significant quantities of specialized steels. Overall industrial output has grown at an average rate of more than 10 percent per year, having surpassed all other sectors in economic growth and degree of modernization. Some heavy industries and products deemed to be of national strategic importance remain state-owned, but an increasing proportion of lighter and consumer-oriented manufacturing firms are privately held or are private-state joint ventures.|$|E
25|$|Hypercycle theory {{proposed}} that hypercycles {{are not the}} final state of organization, and further development of more complicated systems is possible by enveloping the hypercycle {{in some kind of}} membrane. After evolution of compartments, a genome integration of the hypercycle can proceed by linking its members into a single chain, which forms a precursor of a genome. After that, the whole individualized and compartmentalized hypercycle can behave like a simple self-replicating entity. Compartmentalization provides some advantages for <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> already established a linkage between units. Without compartments, genome integration would boost competition by limiting space and resources. Moreover, adaptive evolution requires the package of transmissible information for advantageous mutations in order not to aid less-efficient copies of the gene. The first advantage is that it maintains a high local concentration of molecules, which helps to locally increase the rate of synthesis. Secondly, it keeps the effect of mutations local, {{while at the same time}} affecting the whole compartment. This favours preservation of beneficial mutations, because it prevents them from spreading away. At the same time, harmful mutations cannot pollute the entire system if they are enclosed by the membrane. Instead, only the contaminated compartment is destroyed, without affecting other compartments. In that way, compartmentalization allows for selection for genotypic mutations. Thirdly, membranes protect against environmental factors because they constitute a barrier for high-weight molecules or UV irradiation. Finally, the membrane surface can work as a catalyst.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the central}} {{arguments}} of Wollstonecraft's Rights of Men is that rights should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, {{not because they are}} traditional. While Burke argued that civil society and government should rely on traditions which had accrued over centuries, Wollstonecraft contends that all civil agreements are subject to rational reassessment. Precedence, she maintains, is no reason to accept a law or a constitution. As one scholar puts it, [...] "Burke's belief in the antiquity of the British constitution and the impossibility of improvement upon <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been tried and tested through time is dismissed as nonsense.

2500|$|Zelaya supporters, {{largely from}} labour unions and the poor, claim {{conservative}} business leaders are actually concerned because Zelaya had sharply increased the minimum wage.

Components are designed to operate at a great temperature range, from below freezing to over [...] Diesel fuel is expected to burn efficiently and produce as few emissions as possible. As emission standards are being introduced to diesel engines the need to control harmful emissions is being designed into the parameters of diesel engine fuel systems. The traditional inline injection system is more forgiving to poorer quality fuels {{as opposed to the}} common rail fuel system. The higher pressures and tighter tolerances of the common rail system allows for greater control over atomization and injection timing. This control of atomization as well as combustion allows for greater efficiency of modern diesel engines as well as greater control over emissions. Components within a diesel fuel system interact with the fuel in a way to ensure efficient operation of the fuel system and so the engine. If an out-of-specification fuel is introduced to <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> specific parameters of operation, then the integrity of the overall fuel system may be compromised.
