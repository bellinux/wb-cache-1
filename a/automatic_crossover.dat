5000|$|Many modern Ethernet host {{adapters}} can automatically detect another computer {{connected with}} a straight-through cable and then automatically introduce the required crossover, if needed; if neither of the adapters has this capability, then a crossover cable is required. Most newer switches have <b>automatic</b> <b>crossover</b> ("auto MDI-X" [...] or [...] "auto-uplink") on all ports, eliminating the uplink port and the MDI/MDI-X switch, and allowing all connections to be made with straight-through cables. If both devices being connected support 1000BASE-T according to the standards, they will connect regardless of whether a straight-through or crossover cable is used.|$|E
40|$|Given a {{multichannel}} loudspeaker system, {{the selection}} of the crossover frequency between the sub-woofer and the satellite speakers is important for accurate (i. e., distortion-free), reproduction of playback sound. Presently, many home-theater systems have selectable crossover frequencies which are either set by the consumer through listening tests. Al-ternatively, if the loudspeakers are industry certified, the crossover frequency is set at 80 Hz. A desirable feature is that, besides distortion-free sound output from the indi-vidual subwoofer and the satellite speakers, the combined sub-woofer and satellite room acoustical response should exhibit negligible variations around the selected crossover frequency. In this paper, we present an <b>automatic</b> <b>crossover</b> frequency selection algorithm based on an objective mea-sure (viz., the spectral deviation measure) for multichan-nel home-theater applications that allows better control of the combined subwoofer-satellite response, thereby signifi-cantly improving audio quality. 1...|$|E

40|$|Background: To {{understand}} protein function, it {{is important}} to study protein- protein interaction networks. These networks can be represented in network diagrams called protein interaction maps that can lead to better understanding by visualization. We address the problem of drawing of protein interactions in Kohn's Molecular Interaction Map (MIM) notation. Even though there are some existing tools for graphical visualization of protein interactions in general, there is no tool that can draw protein interactions with MIM notation with full support. Results: MIMTool was developed for drawing protein interaction maps in Kohn's MIM notation. MIMTool was developed using the Qt toolkit libraries and introduces several unique features such as full interactivity, object dragging, ability to export files in MIMML, SBML and line drawing with <b>automatic</b> bending and <b>crossover</b> minimization, which are not available in other diagram editors. MIMTool also has a unique orthogonal edge drawing method that is both easy and more flexible than other orthogonal drawing methods present in other interaction drawing tools. Conclusions: MIMTool facilitates faster drawing, updating and exchanging of MIMs. Among its several features, it also includes a semi-automatic drawing algorithm that makes use of shortest path algorithm for constructing lines with small number of bends and crossings. MIMTool contributes a much needed software tool that was missing and will facilitate wider adoption of Kohn's MIM notation. Comment: BioVis 2014 conferenc...|$|R
