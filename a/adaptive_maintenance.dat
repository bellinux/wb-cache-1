40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the relationship between recent work in logic programming and recent developments in software engineering. The relationship to software engineering is more specifically concerned with how formal specifications can be used to explain and represent the basis of software maintenance and evolution. Some of the results reviewed here have appeared in [5] and [13]. These previous results are summarized, extended, and made more general in this paper. 1 Introduction Maintenance activities can be divided into three distinct classes: corrective, perfective, and <b>adaptive.</b> Corrective <b>maintenance</b> largely reflects the failure of software engineers to validate and verify software specifications and programs with respect to software specifications, respectively. Perfective maintenance is traditionally viewed as a form of maintenance necessary to improve or change the performance of a system, but not its functionality. <b>Adaptive</b> software <b>maintenance</b> alters the function [...] ...|$|R

The preventive maintenance and buffer allocation policy {{is characterized by a}} dynamic decision on the time between the preventive actions, and a dynamic decision on the maximum level of the buffers’ storage allowed. The objective is to obtain a policy adaptable to the production line conditions reducing redesign activities.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a {{condition-based}} maintenance policy for a two-component system with dependencies. Two kinds of dependency are investigated. The first is state dependence whereby the deterioration speed of each component depends not only on its own state (deterioration level) {{but also on the}} state of the other. The second is economic dependence whereby combining maintenance activities is cheaper than performing maintenance on components separately. To select a component/group of components to be preventively maintained, <b>adaptive</b> preventive <b>maintenance</b> and opportunistic maintenance rules are proposed. A cost model is developed to find the optimal value of decision parameters. A numerical example is introduced to illustrate the use and the advantages of the proposed approach in the maintenance optimization framework...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{case study}} of three open source systems {{undergoing}} large <b>adaptive</b> <b>maintenance</b> tasks is presented. The <b>adaptive</b> <b>maintenance</b> task involves migrating each system to {{a new version of}} a third party API. The changes to support the migration were spread out over multiple years for each system. The first two systems are both part of KDE, namely KOffice and Extragear/graphics. The <b>adaptive</b> <b>maintenance</b> task, for both systems, involves migrating to a new version of Qt. The third system is OpenSceneGraph that underwent a migration to a new version of OpenGL. The case study involves sifting through tens of thousands of commits to identify only those commits involved in the specific <b>adaptive</b> <b>maintenance</b> task.

40|$|Abstract — An {{approach}} to automate <b>adaptive</b> <b>maintenance</b> changes on large-scale software systems is presented. This approach uses lightweight parsing and lightweight on-the-fly static analysis to support transformations that make corrections to source code {{in response to}} <b>adaptive</b> <b>maintenance</b> changes, such as platform changes. SrcML, an XML source code representation, is used and transformations can be performed using either XSLT or LINQ. A number of specific adaptive changes are presented, based on recent <b>adaptive</b> <b>maintenance</b> needs from products at ABB Inc. The transformations are described in detail and then demonstrated {{on a number of}} examples from the production systems. The results are compared with manual adaptive changes that were done by professional developers. The approach performed better than the manual changes, as it successfully transformed instances missed by the developers while not missing any instances itself. The work demonstrates that this lightweight approach is both efficient and accurate with an overall cost savings in development time and effort.

40|$|In modern {{software}} development, maintenance {{accounts for}} the majority of the total cost and effort in a software project. Especially burdensome are those tasks which require applying a new technology in order to adapt an application to changed requirements or a different environment. This research explores methodologies, techniques, and approaches for automating such adap-tive maintenance tasks. By combining high-level specifications and generative techniques, a new methodology shapes the design of approaches to automating <b>adaptive</b> <b>maintenance</b> tasks in the application domains of high performance computing (HPC) and enterprise soft-ware. Despite the vast differences of these domains and their respective requirements, each approach is shown to be effective at alleviating their <b>adaptive</b> <b>maintenance</b> burden. This thesis proves that it is possible to effectively automate tedious and error-prone <b>adaptive</b> <b>maintenance</b> tasks in a diverse set of domains by exploiting high-level specifications to syn-thesize specialized low-level code. The specific contributions of this thesis are as follows: (1) a common methodology for designing automated approaches to <b>adaptive</b> <b>maintenance,</b> (2) a novel approach to automating the generation of efficient marshaling logic for HPC applica-tions from a high-level visual model, and (3) a novel approach to automatically upgrading legacy enterprise applications to use annotation-based frameworks. The technical contributions of this thesis have been realized in two software tools for au-tomated adaptive maintenance: MPI Serializer, a marshaling logic generator for MPI ap-plications, and Rosemari, an inference and transformation engine for upgrading enterprise applications. This thesis is based on research papers accepted to IPDPS ’ 08 [93] and OOPSLA ’ 08 [92]. ii...|$|E

For corrective <b>maintenance</b> actions, an <b>adaptive</b> opportunistic <b>maintenance</b> decision rule taking intoaccount both the criticality level of components and logistic support constraints is introduced. Moreover, both economicand structure dependencies between components are studied and integrated in maintenance model.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Software {{maintenance}} is {{the design and}} integration of consistent changes to an existing software system and consists of various activities [Gallagher 1991]. One such activity, perfective maintenance, is concerned with improving the eciency of software and increasing its maintainability [Burch 1992; Schach 1999]. Apart from these gains, perfective maintenance also aects the other activities of corrective and <b>adaptive</b> <b>maintenance.</b> First, a system that can be eciently maintained allows one to quickly isolate and correct errors (corrective maintenance). Second, such a system ensures that new functionality can be added more easily to address the changing needs of users (<b>adaptive</b> <b>maintenance).</b> Restructuring, also called refactoring when used {{in the context of}} object-oriented frameworks [Opdyke 1992; Fowler 2000], is one technique that may be applied to improve the structure, and therefore the maintainability, of a software system. Restructuring is the process of re-organizin...|$|E
40|$|Software {{maintenance}} involves {{different categories}} of activities: corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive. However, research regarding these distinct activities is hampered {{by lack of}} empirical data that is labeled to identify the type of maintenance being performed. A promising dataset {{is provided by the}} more than 800 releases of the Linux kernel that have been made since 1994. The Linux release scheme differentiates between development versions (which may be expected to undergo perfective maintenance) and production versions (probably dominated by corrective maintenance). The structure of the codebase also distinguishes code involved in handling different architectures and devices (where additions reflect <b>adaptive</b> <b>maintenance)</b> from the core of the system’s kernel. Assuming that these dissections of the codebase indeed reflect different types of activity, we demonstrate that corrective maintenance does not necessarily lead to code deterioration, that <b>adaptive</b> <b>maintenance</b> may improve some quality metrics, and that growth is largely the result of continued development as part of perfective maintenance...|$|E

40|$|We {{explored}} an <b>adaptive</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{model of}} the process environment to diagnose progressive faults in manufacturing systems. Progressive faults are usually caused by deterioration of the operating environment or aging and show stochastic properties. Many researchers have reported how to detect faults on the machine body in manufacturing systems. However, {{little research has been}} conducted on the process environment which causes progressive faults. To tackle this problem, we explored an <b>adaptive</b> <b>maintenance</b> model to detect progressive faults and repair the process environment on the E-repair location. When a difference of the environmental factor state is detected, it will combine the transcription factor and the state enzyme to locate fault source. Then the comprehensive maintenance program is derived to repair the operating environment while eliminating progressive faults. For the purpose of validation, this model was implemented on the process environment of the air separation plant. And the simulation experiments validated the feasibility and effectiveness of this method...|$|E

Then learning strategy is implemented for refinement of knowledge base to improve the performance of call quality over time. Finally, we discuss the advantages and uniqueness of our approach...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Data {{dissemination}} {{from multiple}} sources to mobile sinks is fundamental and challenging in WSN applications due to limited energy supply of sensor nodes and sink mobility. Previous data dissemination protocols either rely on an energy-consuming coordinate system or build an inefficient backbone. In this paper, we pro-pose a hierarchical role-based data dissemination (HRDD) protocol in wireless sensor networks. In HRDD, {{a small number}} of sensor nodes are assigned to serve as cluster heads and agents to form the data dissemination backbone and mitigate unnecessary query forwarding. In addition, HRDD designs an efficient data delivery mechanism that provides shorter paths to accelerate data delivery as well as reduce the number of data transmissions. An <b>adaptive</b> backbone <b>maintenance</b> mechanism is also introduced for low-energy cluster heads and agents to reduce their load, thereby prolonging the network lifetime. The experimental results show that HRDD achieves the longer net-work lifetime, the shorter delay, and the high success ratio compared to the prior work...|$|R
40|$|Many rural {{communities}} are vulnerable social-ecological systems (SES) that {{must do more}} than become resilient to future environmental and social shocks: they must transform to achieve sustainability. We aimed first to conceptually explore the proposition that SES characteristics (identity, feedbacks, structure, and functions) necessary for transformation may be distinct from those necessary for <b>adaptive</b> <b>maintenance</b> or resilience, and second, to propose metrics {{that may be used}} to assess these two types of system changes. We did this by interrogating literature and by investigating two rural towns in Australia using a combination of quantitative methods and focus groups to interrogate community social networks, capitals (human, natural, built, and social) and future scenarios. Results indicated that (1) it is practicable to carry out a holistic assessment of SES characteristics (identity, feedbacks, structure, and functions), and (2) purposeful, positive transformation is supported by vision, identification with place, unhappiness (with the status quo), high personal contribution to social capital, open social networks, and latent capital(s). We conclude that {{rural communities}} possess capacities for <b>adaptive</b> <b>maintenance</b> (resilience) and for system-wide transformation, and that the metrics used to assess each are sometimes discrete, sometimes common...|$|E

However, it has limitations when associated with major changes such as software functionality addition or modification as those experienced in the category of perfective maintenance. packaged software, software maintenance, virtual communities 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of carbon {{starvation}} and of varying the growth rate on the activity {{of each of the}} two tandem ribosomal RNA promoters from the rrnA operon of Escherichia coli. The cellular abundance of plasmid-encoded transcripts arising at promoters P 1 and P 2 and terminating at the ribosomal RNA terminator in promoter-terminator fusions, together with transcript turnover rates, was used to estimate promoter activities. The rate of synthesis of the P 1 -promoted transcript was found to increase exponentially with growth rate and predominate at fast growth rates. The activity of the downstream promoter (P 2) changed only slightly at different growth rates. Upon carbon starvation, little or no activity of the upstream promoter was detectable, while P 2 activity persisted. We interpret this to mean that the dual promoters are differentially regulated so as to have separate <b>adaptive</b> and <b>maintenance</b> functions.
