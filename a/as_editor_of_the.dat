5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War, Breckinridge quickly became an ardent supporter of the Union, not for its position against slavery, but for the sake of preserving the Union. He used his position <b>as</b> <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Danville Quarterly Review to advocate his position. He called for harsh measures against secession, and in time, accepted President Lincoln's immediate emancipation of slaves. He was chosen as the temporary chair of the 1864 Republican National Convention that re-nominated Lincoln for president, and his pro-Union speech was hailed by freshman Representative James G. Blaine {{as one of the most}} inspiring given at the event.|$|E
5|$|Greeley, in his paper, {{initially}} {{supported the}} Whig program. As divisions between Clay and President Tyler became apparent, {{he supported the}} Kentucky senator and looked to a Clay nomination for president in 1844. However, when Clay was nominated by the Whigs, he was defeated by the Democrat, former Tennessee governor James K. Polk, though Greeley worked hard on Clay's behalf. Greeley had taken positions in opposition to slavery <b>as</b> <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> New-Yorker in the late 1830s, opposing the annexation of the slaveholding Republic of Texas to the United States. In the 1840s, Greeley became an increasingly vocal opponent of the expansion of slavery.|$|E

The United States' Civil Rights Act, embodying many of the reforms for which DuBois had campaigned his entire life, was enacted a year after his death.|$|E
5|$|Hebel was {{interested}} in botany, natural history and other subjects. His literary work began with Allemannische Gedichte, which {{is perhaps the most}} popular work written in Alemannic. He had success with his calendar stories in the Badischer Landkalender, and later with Rheinländischer Hausfreund (Rhenish family friend), but a dispute between Catholics forced him to resign <b>as</b> <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> calendar. In his last years he devoted himself increasingly to religion, becoming a prelate in 1819, but his wish to become a parish priest was never fulfilled. His last works were biblical stories for young readers, which served as textbooks until 1855. Hebel died 1826 in Schwetzingen. Goethe, Tolstoy, Gottfried Keller, Hermann Hesse and other writers have praised his works.|$|E

5|$|Although having reached legal {{retirement}} age in 1927, and thus unable {{to be offered}} another five-year contract, Murray was reappointed {{on an annual basis}} each year until 1935. At this point, she retired, expressing the opinion that she was glad to leave UCL, for reasons that she did not make clear. In 1933, Petrie had retired from UCL and moved to Jerusalem in Mandatory Palestine with his wife; Murray therefore took over <b>as</b> <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ancient Egypt journal, renaming it Ancient Egypt and the East to reflect its increasing research interest in the ancient societies that surrounded and interacted with Egypt. The journal folded in 1935, perhaps due to Murray's retirement. Murray then spent some time in Jerusalem, where she aided the Petries in their excavation at Tall al-Ajjul, a Bronze Age mound south of Gaza.|$|E
5|$|In America, {{he again}} tried {{his hand at}} journalism, but a brief stint <b>as</b> <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Yorker Yiddishe Ilustrirte Zaitung {{resulted}} only in getting the paper suspended and landing himself a rather large fine. On March 31, 1905, he recited poetry at a benefit performance at Cooper Union to raise a pension for Yiddish poet Eliakum Zunser, even worse off than himself because he had found himself unable to write since coming to America in 1889. Shortly afterwards, he met {{a group of young}} people who had a Hebrew language association at the Dr. Herzl Zion Club, and wrote a Hebrew-language play David ba-Milchama (David in the War), which they performed in March 1906, the first Hebrew-language play to be performed in America. Repeat performances in March 1907 and April 1908 drew successively larger crowds.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{wait for}} {{replacement}} equipment, Barnette purchased {{the press of}} a newly arrived editor, William Fentress Thompson, who had intended to set up his own newspaper. As part of the purchasing deal in August 1906, Thompson was allowed to publish an evening paper—the Tanana Daily Miner—while the Fairbanks Daily News {{was published in the}} morning. The deal lasted only through September, as Thompson and Barnette conflicted on a personal level. The Tanana Miner was reduced to a weekly newspaper, then Thompson was deposed <b>as</b> <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fairbanks News in June 1907 and took the Tanana Miner to the settlement of Chena, outside Fairbanks. Barnette, meanwhile, became embroiled in a series of legal troubles. He faced opposition from the owner of the Fairbanks Times, A.L. Anderson, who had fought Barnette about several gold claims near Fairbanks and purchased the Times to compete against Barnette.|$|E
