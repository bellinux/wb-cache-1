40|$|We {{propose a}} push/pull origami antenna, transformable between a single antenna element and a three-element array. In limited space, the {{proposed}} origami antenna can {{work as a}} single antenna. When the space is not limited and a higher gain is required, the proposed origami antenna can be transformed to a series antenna array by pulling the frame. In order to push the antenna array back to a single antenna, the frame for each antenna element size must be different. The frame and supporting dielectric materials are built using a three-dimensional (3 D) printer. The conductive patterns are inkjet-printed on paper. Thus, the proposed origami antenna is built using hybrid printing technology. The 10 -dB impedance bandwidth is 2. 5 – 2. 65 GHz and 2. 48 – 2. 62 GHz for the single-antenna and <b>array</b> <b>mode,</b> respectively, and the peak gains in the single-antenna and <b>array</b> <b>mode</b> are 5. 8 dBi and 7. 6 dBi, respectively.

40|$|Scattering of photons by phonons, or Brillouin scattering, enables {{manipulation}} {{and control of}} light and has led to revolutionary applications, from slow light to saser and cooling of micromechanical resonators. Recently, enhanced light and sound interaction has been demonstrated in waveguides. However, {{the design of the}} waveguide geometry tunes and alters the phonon and photon dispersion simultaneously. Here we investigate, through femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy and theoretical modeling, the light and sound interaction in a bottom-up fabricated vertical nanowire photonic crystal. In such a system, the phonon dispersion can be tuned by varying the geometry of the constituent nanowires. In contrast, the placement of the nanowires in the photonic crystal can be used for tuning optical <b>array</b> <b>modes,</b> without altering the phonon dispersion. We demonstrate the forward and backward scattering, by acoustic phonons in the nanowires, of (1) such optical <b>array</b> <b>modes</b> and (2) guided modes of the constituent nanowires. Furthermore, our results reveal an enhanced interaction of <b>array</b> <b>modes</b> with phonons that we attribute to the specific scattering mechanism. Our results enable the design of a photonic crystal with separately tailored photon and phonon dispersion for Brillouin scattering. We anticipate these advances to be a starting point for enhanced control of light at the nanoscale...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the characteristics of}} parabolic bow-tie laser arrays (PBTLAs) which are a novel category of laser diodes specially designed to achieve high power with high brightness at 980 nm. Output powers in excess of 2. 8 W/facet have been measured from five-element PBTLAs with output beam less than twice the diffraction limit, achieving high brightness of 275 MWcm/sup - 2 /srad/sup - 1 / at 3 A (pulsed) injection current (= 22 times the threshold). Changes in the achievable brightness due {{to changes in the}} optical cavity geometry and in the lateral optical guiding strength are discussed in detail, using the coupled-mode theory to interpret the experimental results. At threshold all devices operate in the highest (double lobed) <b>array</b> <b>mode.</b> At higher currents the arrays of tapered lasers change to quasi-in-phase operation when the modal gain of the fundamental <b>array</b> <b>mode</b> dominates because of the combined effect of carrier hole burning and spatial filtering from the narrow stripe central section of the device. Similar trends have been observed under continuous-wave operation. The reduction of lateral optical guiding strength is deleterious for the operational characteristics of PBTLAs and linear bow-tie arrays, and it leads to filamentation in gain-guided devices even at low currents. Theoretical results presented in this paper show that scalability is in principle possible; however, changes in the lateral gain profile due to hole-burning can significantly increase the modal gain of higher order modes and, therefore, strongly influence the optical output profile...|$|E

Now, {{more than a decade}} later, major breakthroughs have occurred, both in theory and experiment, that have allowed phase-locked arrays to meet their promise of reliable, highcontinuous-wave (CW) power (= 0. 5 W) operation in diffraction-limited beams as well as multiwatt (5 - 10 W) near-diffraction-limited peak-pulsed-power operation.

Overview By comparison with other types of high-power, coherent semiconductor-based sources (“broad area”-type master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA), unstable resona-tor), phase-locked arrays have some unique advantages: graceful degradation; no need for optical isolators; no need for external optics to compensate for phasefront aberra-tions due to thermal-and/or carrier-induced variations in the dielectric constant; and, foremost, intrinsic beam stability with drive level due to a strong, built-in, real-index profile.

Effects associated with the cross-modal gain are illustrated analytically on a system of two thin parallel planar waveguides.
