50|$|Crowley has {{expanded}} its petroleum carrying capabilities in recent years {{with the construction of}} four new 155,000-barrel <b>articulated</b> <b>tug</b> barge (ATB) tank vessels and ten 185,000-barrel ATBs, the last of which was delivered in 2011. In 2007, the company placed orders for three, 330,000-barrel ATBs, which are scheduled for delivery by mid-2013.|$|E
5000|$|Crowley Maritime Corporation, {{based in}} Jacksonville, Florida, and founded in 1892, is {{primarily}} a family and employee-owned marine solutions, energy and logistics services company that provides services in the U.S. and international markets. As of July 2016, the company was ranked as the 13th largest private company in Florida, employing approximately 5,300 people worldwide with revenue of $2.2 billion. [...] It provides its services using a fleet of more than 300 vessels, consisting of RO-RO vessels, LO-LO vessels, tankers, <b>Articulated</b> Tug-Barges (ATBs), <b>tugs</b> and barges. Crowley's land-based facilities and equipment include terminals, warehouses, tank farms, and specialized vehicles.|$|R
50|$|On 25 August 1947, she {{proceeded}} to Orange, Tex., {{where she was}} decommissioned the same day and assigned to the Texas Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet. The tug was named Undaunted on 16 July 1948 and transferred to {{the custody of the}} Maritime Administration—although still owned by the Navy—in September 1961. By January 1963, her name was struck from the Navy list. She was later transferred to the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries. She was then loaned as a training vessel to the US Merchant Marine academy at Kings Point, NY and renamed the T/V Kings Pointer. In 1993 the Kings Pointer was sold to basic Towing of Escanaba, MI and was renamed the Krystal K. In 1998 the vessel was sold again to Pere Marquette Shipping of Ludington, MI for use as a push tug for their 400 bulk barge Pere Marquette 41. The Krystal K was rebuilt as an <b>articulated</b> pusher <b>tug</b> and received a Hydraconn connection system and an elevated pilot house. Upon completion the tug was given her original name of Undaunted. The M/T Undaunted is still in service to this day on the Great Lakes.|$|R
50|$|The Bludworth ATB ocean tug barge {{connection}} {{system was}} developed by Richard and Robert Bludworth during the 1960s. The first Bludworth <b>articulated</b> <b>tug</b> barge unit was the ocean LPG barge Ponciana which was coupled with the converted ATB tug Texan in 1970. The Texan sank off Cape Hatteras in 1979. The Ponciana is still a working ocean LPG barge coupled with the 1980 built tug Texan.|$|E
50|$|Her {{conversion}} to a barge included removing the vessel's original engines, and cutting a large notch in her stern.As a barge the vessel used two different barge-tug coupling systems.Initially she was {{pushed by the}} Atlantic Hickory. In 1999 her notch was converted to the Bark River <b>Articulated</b> <b>Tug</b> Barge Coupling System. The tug Jane Ann IV has large pins which mate into sockets in the Sarah Spencer's notch. The Sarah Spencer was listed as for sale as scrap in 2005.|$|E
50|$|Crowley {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{independent}} operators of petroleum barges and tankers in the U.S. The company provides chemical parcel transportation and bulk petroleum transportation throughout the North American coasts, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and to a lesser degree internationally. Crowley's tank vessels include ships, <b>articulated</b> <b>tug</b> and barge units (ATBs), and conventional tug and barges. Ships and articulated barges range in size from 20,000 deadweight tonnage (DWT) to 50,000 DWT, while Crowleys U.S. West Coast coastal tank barges and Alaska line haul fleet range from 5,500 DWT to 16,200 DWT. All Crowley tank vessels operate under ISM / ISO 9002 standards.|$|E
50|$|Bay Shipbuilding Company (BSC) is a {{shipyard}} and {{dry dock}} company in Sturgeon Bay, Door County, Wisconsin. As of 2015, Bay Ships was {{a subsidiary of}} Fincantieri Marine Group and produces <b>articulated</b> <b>tug</b> and barges, OPA-90 compliant double hull tank ships and offshore support vessels. It also provides repair services to the lake freighter fleet. In the past the shipyard located in Sturgeon Bay has operated under several different names and traces its history back to 1918. The company also built 40,000 ton Lake freighters in the 1970s and 1980s. While capable of producing large freighters, the yard has not built a freighter over 20,000 tons since 1987. Former names of the shipyards at the 2015 location of Bay Shipbuilding are: Sturgeon Bay Shipbuilding, Leathem D. Smith Shipbuilding Company and Christy Corporation.|$|E
40|$|In {{the design}} of ships and {{offshore}} structures, it is often desirable to assess the effects of environmental forces such as wind and waves on the vessel prior to its construction.
