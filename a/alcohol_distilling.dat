50|$|Chinese {{economic}} {{dominance of}} Cambodia dates back the pre-French colonial kingdoms where Chinese merchants often maintained patron-client {{relationships with the}} Khmer monarchy. William Willmot, a Sinologist at the University of British Columbia estimated that 90 percent of the Chinese in Cambodia were involved in commerce in 1963. Today, an estimated 60 percent are urban dwellers engage in commerce {{while the rest of}} the rural population work as shopkeepers, processors of food products (such as rice, palm sugar, fruit, and fish), and moneylenders. Throughout Cambodian cities, Chinese dominated numerous industries such as retail, hospitality, export-import trade, light, food processing, soft drinks, printing and machine shops. In addition, virtually all of Cambodia's richest people are of Chinese descent. Rural Chinese businessmen operated general shops that provided ethnic Khmer peasants with essential purchases such as farming supplies, groceries imported from China, sanpots and sarongs, bamboo baskets, perfume, kerosene for lamps, alcohol as well as tobacco. Those in the Kampot Province and parts of Kaoh Kong Province cultivate black pepper and fruit (especially rambutans, durians, and coconuts). Additionally, rural Chinese Cambodians also engaged in salt water fishing. In the 19th century, French colonials allowed Chinese-run businesses to flourish due to their laissez faire capitalist policies. Willmott estimated that the ethnic Chinese controlled 92 percent of the Cambodian economy by the mid-20th century. They traded in urban areas and worked as shopkeepers, moneylenders and traditional healers in rural areas, while Chinese farmers controlled Cambodia’s lucrative Kampot pepper industry. Chinese Cambodian moneylenders wield considerable economic power over the poorer indigenous ethnic Khmer peasants through usury at an interest rate of 10 to 20 percent per month. This might have been the reason why seventy-five percent of the peasants in Cambodia were in debt in 1952, according to the Australian Colonial Credit Office. Chinese Cambodian entrepreneurs are also estimated to control 70 percent of the industrial investment and are actively engaged in trading, real estate development, construction, small-scale manufacturing, <b>alcohol</b> <b>distilling,</b> hospitality, fast food restaurants, and food processing. Ethnic Chinese also dominate the silk weaving industry where key commercial positions in the Cambodian silk trading networks are completely held in Chinese hands.|$|E
