5|$|Government policy {{designed}} to promote affordable housing, widespread failures in corporate and regulatory governance, and historically low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve led to the mid-2000s housing bubble, which culminated with the 2008 financial crisis, the largest economic contraction in the nation's history since the Great Depression. Barack Obama, the first <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> multiracial president, was elected in 2008 amid the crisis, and subsequently passed stimulus measures and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act {{in an attempt to}} mitigate its negative effects and ensure there would not be a repeat of the crisis.

Dodd-Frank improved financial stability and consumer protection, although there is evidence it may have had a negative impact on small banks.|$|E

40|$|Colorectal cancer (CRC) {{has been}} one of the leading causes of cancer death in the United States. Although {{incidence}} and mortality rates of colorectal cancer in the United States have decreased in recent years, the disparity in CRC incidence <b>and</b> mortality between <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> Whites remain. Disparity in CRC screening rates is believed to be one of the causes that contribute to the disparity in CRC incidence and mortality between these two races. Finding the differences in CRC screening barriers and predictors between these two groups can help us to design more effective intervention programs to improve CRC screening rates for <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b> However, most of the previous studies have investigated different types of CRC screening barriers for <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> and/or Whites, but no studies have compared the same CRC screening barriers between <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> Whites. The purpose of this study is to describe and compare the same CRC screening barriers between these two races. Using chi-square analysis, significant differences between <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> Whites were found for marital status, income and education. Compared to Whites, <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> were less aware of CRC screening procedures and lacked CRC knowledge. Significant differences were found between <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> Whites in the awareness of sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy and barium enema. After adjusting for sex, education, marital status, and household income, six out of thirteen CRC screening barriers and two out of nine CRC screening predictors remained to be statistically significantly different between <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> Whites. The results of this study indicated that different CRC screening barriers and predictors had different impact on <b>African</b> <b>Americans,</b> <b>and</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> had more CRC barriers to overcome than Whites. ...|$|R

5|$|After World War 2, William Marbury, then Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Peabody Institute, {{began the}} process of {{integrating}} that institution, which had denied entrance to several well-regarded African American performers based solely on their race, including Anne Brown and Todd Duncan, {{who had been the}} first black performer with the New York City Opera when he was forced to study with Frank Bibb, a member of the Peabody faculty, outside the Conservatory. The director of the Peabody soon ended segregation, both at the Conservatory and at the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, which was conducted by its first African American, A. Jack Thomas, at his request. The Peabody was officially integrated in 1949, with support from mayor Howard W. Jackson. Paul A. Brent, who graduated in 1953, was the first to matriculate, and was followed by Audrey Cyrus McCallum, who was the first to enter the Peabody Preparatory. Musical integration was a gradual process that lasted until at least 1966, when the unions for <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> white musicians merged to form the Musicians' Association of Metropolitan Baltimore.

5|$|Earlier historians, {{including}} Beale, {{believed that}} money drove events, {{and had seen}} Reconstruction as an economic struggle. They also accepted, for the most part, that reconciliation between North and South {{should have been the}} top priority of Reconstruction. In the 1950s, historians began to focus on the African-American experience as central to Reconstruction. They rejected completely any claim of black inferiority, which had marked many earlier historical works, and saw the developing Civil Rights Movement as a second Reconstruction; some writers stated they hoped their work on the postbellum era would advance the cause of civil rights. These authors sympathized with the Radical Republicans for their desire to help the <b>African</b> <b>American,</b> <b>and</b> saw Johnson as callous towards the freedman. In a number of works from 1956 onwards by such historians as Fawn Brodie, the former president was depicted as a successful saboteur of efforts to better the freedman's lot. These volumes included major biographies of Stevens and Stanton. Reconstruction was increasingly seen as a noble effort to integrate the freed slaves into society.|$|E

At 13, she decided to pursue recording, but her parents initially advised her to wait. At the age of 15 Knowles replaced a departed dancer and performed with her sister's group Destiny's Child on tour. During the group's opening stint for American pop singer Christina Aguilera's tour, Knowles temporarily replaced Destiny's Child member Kelly Rowland after she broke her toes backstage during a costume change.

40|$|Inroduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore factors {{associated}} with willingness of <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> Latinos to participate in biomedical and public health research and to delineate factors that influence the decision to become a human subject. Methods: We present results from a 2010 random digit-dial telephone survey of 2, 455 <b>African</b> <b>American</b> (NÂ =Â  1191) <b>and</b> Latino (NÂ =Â  1264) adults. We used standard measures to assess knowledge of research, terminology, informed consent procedures, previous participation in research, health care experiences, social support, risk perception, religiousness, and trust. Results: Over 60 % of both <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> Latinos reported they believed people in medical research are pressured into participating. Over 50 % said that it was not at all important to have someone of the same race/ethnicity ask them to participate. In a sub-sample of 322 <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> 190 Latinos who had previously been asked to participate in a research study, 63 % of <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> 65 % of Latinos consented to participate in a study. Finally, both <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> (57 %) <b>and</b> Latinos (68 %) reported willingness to participate in future research. Overall, the multivariate analysis explained 29 % of the variability in willingness to participate in future research. Conclusions: Results suggest that <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> Latinos have no automatic predisposition to decline participation in research studies. These results can inform culturally tailored interventions for ethical recruitment of minorities into research and clinical trials...|$|R
