We propose a Scalable Authentication Infrastructure for Next-generation Trust (SAINT), which partitions the Internet into groups with common, local trust roots, and isolates the effects of a compromised trust root. SAINT requires groups with direct routing connections to cross-sign each other for authentication purposes, allowing diverse <b>authentication</b> <b>policies</b> while keeping all entities globally verifiable. SAINT makes trust root management a central part of the network architecture, enabling trust root updates within seconds and allowing users to make flexible trust decisions.

40|$|With {{the growing}} {{success of the}} social Web, most Web {{developers}} have to interact {{with at least one}} social Web platform, which implies studying the related API specifications. These are often only informally described, may contain errors, lack harmonization, and generally speaking make the developer’s work difficult. Most attempts to solve this problem, proposing formal description languages for Web service APIs, have had limited success outside of B 2 B applications; we believe it is due to their top-down nature. In addition, a programmer dealing with one or several of these APIs has to deal with a number of related tasks such as data integration, requests chaining, or policy management, that are cumbersome to implement. Inspired by the SPORE project, we present API Blender, an open-source solution to describe, interact with, and integrate the most common social Web APIs. In this perspective, we first introduce two new lightweight description formats for requests and services and demonstrate their relevance with respect to current platform APIs.

In this work, we explore how both standardized protocols and novel constructions may be developed to authenticate entities as members of a group associated to a particular security label, whilst protecting the long-term secrets in the system.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the {{evolution}} of digital library authentication standards and practices in the UK, and to use the issue of authentication to reflect on the nature of national information management policy and its associated structures. Design/methodology/approach – A brief historical account of British authentication developments set in the context of different international approaches, with some insights into the national decision-making structures that have shaped the nature of UK authentication practice. Findings – The paper finds that the shape of national information management structures had played an essential role in the evolution of <b>authentication</b> <b>policy</b> and practice in the UK, and that the solutions that have evolved as a consequence of this have not necessarily been the most user-friendly or logical that could have been achieved. Research limitations/implications – Research into best authentication practice should be taken forward from the widest possible international perspective, in order to gather the best solutions from wherever they are available. Practical implications – Practitioner engagement with the issues of national information management can help form a more intelligent debate on the best ways to shape large-scale information developments. Originality/value – This paper looks at various aspects of British digital library authentication systems with a critical eye, and asks librarians to consider familiar aspects of such existing systems from a different perspective...|$|E

40|$|International audienceNetwork {{security}} is in a daily evolving domain. Every day, new attacks, virus or intrusion techniques are released. Hence, network devices, enterprise servers or personal computers are potential targets of these attacks. Current secu- rity solutions like firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS) and virtual private networks (VPN) are centralized solutions which rely {{mostly on the}} analyze of inbound network connec- tions. This approach notably forgets {{the effects of a}} rogue station, whose communications cannot be easily controlled unless the administrators establish a global <b>authentication</b> <b>policy</b> using methods like 802. 1 x to control all network com- munications among each device. To the best of our knowledge, a distributed and easily manageable solution for the global security of an enterprise network does not exist. In this paper, we present a new approach to deploy a distributed security solution where communication between each device can be control in a collaborative manner. Indeed, each device has its own security rules, who can be shared and improved through exchanges with others devices. With this new approach, called grid of security, a community of devices ensures that a device is trustworthy and that communications between devices progress in respect of the control of the system policies. To support this approach, we present a new communication model that helps structuring the distribution of security services among the devices. Like this, we can secure both ad-hoc, local-area or enterprise networks in a decentralized manner, preventing the risk of a security breach {{in the case of a}} failure...|$|E

The focus of this report is on a network based access control architecture with as main research questions: What is the best architecture for a NAC solution in this environment? To answer this question, the different stages of network based NAC and their possible techniques are discussed. In chronological order these stages are: detection, registration and <b>authentication,</b> <b>policy</b> enforcement, preadmission control, access classification and post admission scanning. In the chapters about these stages, practical issues to implement them at the company will be unfolded. Also, a number of sections contain practical verifications of the findings. What elements and services {{should be part of}} this architecture? Elements and services that {{should be part of the}} architecture are placed in different environments the NAC solution can place clients into. In these environments, services as authentication, remediation (e. g. update repositories) and health check systems (e. g. vulnerability scanners and intrusion detection systems) need to be deployed.

Because of this, only IT management and helpdesk support processes should be in place. Next to this, the current processes on adding extra network equipment, asset management and the hardening of clients should be reviewed. Is network based NAC feasible technology for this situation?

40|$|Content {{management}} Software as a Service (SaaS) applications {{have made}} a lot of attention in the recent years. The software and related content is hosted in cloud and remote access is given to the users through a web browser or a thin web client. The content management SaaS solutions store the regulatory content of an organization in cloud. Any successful attempt of unauthorized access to the cloud content can pose certain security risks, ranging from financial loss, defamation, to civil or criminal crime. Security and privacy are two major hindrance for cloud consumers in adopting SaaS based cloud applications. We need a solution to maximize the level of trust between the cloud consumers and the cloud providers. The level of trust can be increased by increasing information security and privacy, which boils down to strong authentication, authorization and access control mechanism. This thesis focuses on new technologies to improve authentication of services consumed in the cloud. Password authentication is the commonly used single-factor authentication mechanism. The password authentication is defenceless to many security threats. Passwords are vulnerable to replay and discovery attacks. They also do not show any resistance to eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle or phishing attacks. Two-factor authentication opens up new horizons in security enhancement. It mandates users to provide two authentication tokens during the authentication phase. The two authentication tokens cover vulnerabilities of each other and combine together to provide higher information security. Ensuring strong authentication is a complete process within itself. The probability of occurrence of a security breach and the loss involved in it play a decisive role in selecting an authentication assurance level. The assurance level is the measurement of the strength of an authentication process. The appropriate technology is selected to meet a certain assurance level and mitigates the exposed risk to an information system. Selecting the appropriate technology includes selecting the authentication tokens, choosing the token management policy and determining the communication protocol between the client and the server. Also, authentication security enhancement is a cyclic process and requires continuous monitoring and improvement. The two-factor authentication solution must secure all the SaaS software and services. While most of the software and services support password authentication, not all of them provide support for two-factor authentication. Ensuring two-factor authentication in a SaaS model is a challenging task and requires all the software and services to be brought under one <b>authentication</b> <b>policy...</b>|$|E
