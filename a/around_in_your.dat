500|$|Chris Schulz of The New Zealand Herald {{said that}} the song, {{alongside}} the album tracks [...] "Paddling Out" [...] and [...] "Bavarian #1 (Say You Will)", [...] "will swirl <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> head for days and demand repeat plays". Spin Josh Modell named it a highlight of the album; he wrote that if the album as a whole sounded like [...] "The Wave", [...] "it could fill arenas". Chris Martins of The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "Though Wyatt's vocals recall a sad-faced Peter Gabriel, the song is steeped {{in the kind of}} effervescent magic that makes Lykke Li and Peter Bjorn and John stars in their own right." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters was critical of Wyatt's vocal performance; he wrote that [...] "we really {{get a sense of how}} Wyatt's voice hinders the group". He {{said that the}} singer intones the lyrics [...] "somewhat abstractly, but with absolutely no sense of gravity to be found in his voice at all".|$|E
500|$|The {{reviewer}} for {{the feminist}} magazine Herizons wrote, [...] "Fences and Windows was written {{to be read}} and shared and talked about and carried <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> bag. It is a book that begs you to write in the margins, and highlight relevant quotes because it's filled with stories, insights, shocking statistics, inspiring anecdotes and refreshing critiques. It's small, it's smart and it's jammed with information and ideas that inspire hope and motivate action." [...] Similarly, reviewing for The Guardian, Stuart Christie wrote, [...] "This is a book to be savoured and referred to every so often, even if just to recharge one's moral batteries." [...] In The Globe and Mail, Stan Persky wrote, [...] "What I like about Klein's reflections on the nascent movement that she both participates in and analyzes is that she indulges in minimal rhetorical rah-rah. Nor does she fudge the shortcomings and screwups of the fledgling activists." ...|$|E
500|$|With Feliciano again up, Secretariat {{returned}} to the track on July 15 as the 6–5 favorite. He broke poorly, but then rushed past the field on the turn to win by six lengths. On July 31 in an allowance race at Saratoga, Feliciano was replaced by Ron Turcotte, the regular jockey for Meadow Stables. Turcotte had ridden the colt in several morning workouts, but had missed his first two starts while recovering from a fall. Secretariat's commanding win as the 2–5 favorite {{caught the attention of}} veteran sportswriter, Charles Hatton. He later reported, [...] "You carry an ideal <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> head, and boy, I thought, 'This is it.' I never saw perfection before. I absolutely could not fault him in any way. And neither could the rest of them and that was the amazing thing about it. The body and the head and the eye and the general attitude. It was just incredible. I couldn't believe my eyes, frankly." ...|$|E

500|$|Ryan Brockington from New York Post lauded the song, writing [...] "it’s a very surprising, and {{somewhat}} brilliant, apology track where Taylor sings about wishing {{to fix a}} relationship she wished she wouldn't have ruined in the first place." [...] His point was echoed by Rudy Klapper from Sputnikmusic, who described the song as a [...] "regret-filled apology". Stephen M. Deusner from Engine 145 gave the song a thumbs-up and praised Swift as [...] "an expressive singer", calling the song [...] "a dark fantasy of apology and reconciliation" [...] which is [...] "a true heartbreaker". Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe graded {{the production of the}} song as [...] "B", complimenting the lyrics in particular, by writing [...] "it’s always a good sign when there’s a line as memorable as that one, the kind that lingers <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> head more than the song itself." [...] He also added that he [...] "appreciate(s) the restrained vocal, though a more varied melody would’ve made the chorus quite a bit more distinctive." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Danny Eccleston's {{review of}} Live from the Artists Den, he {{describes}} [...] "The Art Teacher" [...] as [...] "a great, great song" [...] {{and one of}} Wainwright's [...] "best-loved numbers and for good reason". He writes, [...] "It's transformational... the tragedy of her unspoken love seems to resonate endlessly, as if bouncing mercilessly <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> chest." [...] Sarah Metz, a media arts specialist for the National Endowment for the Arts and a contributor to its [...] "Art Works Blog", related [...] "The Art Teacher" [...] {{to one of her}} own experiences in her 2015 article, [...] "My Artist Crush: Rufus Wainwright": [...] "I had developed a huge crush on one of my English teachers in high school, and was in awe of how he perfectly captured those feelings in a four-minute song." [...] In The Cambridge Companion to the Singer-Songwriter (2016), Katherine Williams said the pronoun shifts within the song's lyrics allow Wainwright [...] "play between genders", and noted that the singer usually sings in the first person.|$|E
2500|$|... "Bitterglass" [...] {{was one of}} {{the earlier}} songs written for the album, while being one of Grant's {{favourite}} songs it is also seen by him as one of the darker songs on the record, and refers to the events of Jon Lee's suicide although Grant noted that it is also uplifting and gives an optimistic feeling in its chorus, while also giving a hypnotic feel alongside stating that the piano in the verses gives [...] "a kind of haunting melody". Other tracks on the album that did not see a single release such as [...] "Morning Life" [...] was a track Grant wanted to be [...] "very atmospheric", and [...] "something that would be great when you are driving <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> car", while also wanting it to have a [...] "cinematic intro". Grant later claimed that [...] "Morning Life" [...] was a track many of the band's fans started to [...] "pick up on" [...] after buying the album, and also said [...] "another version is a possibility". [...] "Pilgrim Soul", the eighth track on the album was described by Grant as its most heaviest and said it will appeal to older fans. He said the album needed the track to [...] "give it a lift {{at the end of the}} record" [...] and that the [...] "sing-a-long chorus" [...] is what makes a song work. The chorus was explained as positive and the verses as dark, with the answer to the verses revealed in the chorus.|$|E

60|$|Only {{let them}} be Christ's sheep, and he will have {{compassion}} on them, and teach them many things. Many may neglect them: but Christ will not. Whoever you may be, however simple you are, however ignorant, however lonely, still, if {{you are one of}} Christ's sheep, if you are harmless and teachable, willing and wishing to learn what is right, then Christ will surely teach you in his good time. There never was a soul on earth, I believe, who really wished for God's light, but what God's light came to it at last, as it will to you, if you be Christ's sheep. If you are proud and conceited, you will learn nothing. If you are fierce and headstrong, you will learn nothing. If you are patient and gentle, you will learn all that you need to know; for Christ will teach you. He has many ways of teaching you. By his ministers; by the Bible; by books; by good friends; by sorrows and troubles; by blessings and comforts; by stirring up your mind to think over the common things which lie all <b>around</b> you <b>in</b> <b>your</b> daily work. But what need for me to go on counting by how many ways Christ will lead you, when he has more ways than man ever dreamed of? Who hath known the mind of the Lord; or who shall be his counsellor? Only be sure that he will teach you, if you wish to learn; and be sure that this is what he will teach you--to know the glory of his Father and your Father, whose name is Love.|$|R
