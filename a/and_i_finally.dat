500|$|Various {{accounts}} of Hubbard's {{service in the}} North Atlantic have been put forward by the Church of Scientology and Hubbard himself. The Church of Scientology states in one publication that Hubbard [...] "took command of an antisubmarine escort vessel with Atlantic convoys". In a 1954 lecture, Hubbard asserted {{that he had been}} sent [...] "to Boston in the very early part of the war to take command of a corvette" [...] and had been given a crew made up of convicts from the Portsmouth Naval Prison. Hubbard stated in another lecture that he had been posted aboard [...] "corvettes, North Atlantic. And I went on fighting submarines in the North Atlantic and doing other things and so on. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> got a set of orders for the ship. By that time I had the squadron." ...|$|E

500|$|When Windsor {{took over}} the role in 1994, she was unhappy with the way Peggy was being scripted. She has commented, [...] "a few things weren't quite right about Peggy at the beginning. On a purely {{superficial}} level, the wig didn't fit right. And the clothes weren't right either. They appeared too downmarket. I was particularly worried about how the character was viewed by the producer and writers. I saw her as much ballsier than they did. I think they envisioned Peggy as this rather sad, vulnerable lady who spent all her time worrying about her children." [...] However, early in 1995, EastEnders acquired a new executive producer, Corinne Hollingworth, who shared Windsor's vision of Peggy. It was Hollingworth who decided that Peggy would be a central character, the new landlady of The Queen Victoria public house, one of the soap's main focal points. Hollingworth stated that Peggy was [...] "not {{going to be allowed}} to just sit in some flat polishing her nails". Windsor has said: [...] "It was like a dream. [...] let me go out with the costume designer and choose Peggy's wardrobe, which needed {{to be a lot more}} flash and upmarket. Corinne and I worked on getting Peggy right <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> began to believe...".|$|E
500|$|... "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth" [...] is a bass solo by Burton, {{accompanied}} on drums by Ulrich. A {{staple of}} Burton's live performances since {{his high school}} days in the band Agents of Misfortune, the instrumental track featured Burton's distinctive [...] "lead-bass" [...] style of playing, incorporating heavy distortion, use of wah-wah pedal and tapping. Bubacz introduces the track as [...] "Bass solo, take one", informing listeners that the song was recorded in one take. [...] "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth" [...] was the bass solo that Burton was playing when Hetfield and Ulrich first saw him at a gig. Hetfield stated: [...] "We heard this wild solo going on and thought, 'I don't see any guitar player up there.' We were both counting the strings <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> turned to Lars and said, 'Dude, that's a bass!' Cliff was up there on stage with his band Trauma with a wah-wah pedal and his huge mop of red hair. He didn't care whether people were there. He was {{looking down at his}} bass, playing." [...] "Whiplash" [...] was the album's first single, issued on August 8, 1983. It features a swift rhythm line of straight 16th notes played at about 200 beats per minute. Hetfield and Burton performed with palm muted technique and precise metronomic control. The lyrics celebrate crowd energy and headbanging. Rock journalist Mick Wall wrote that [...] "Whiplash" [...] signified the birth of thrash metal, stating: [...] "If one wishes to identify the very moment thrash metal arrived spitting and snarling into the world, 'Whiplash' is indisputably it." ...|$|E

On 10 March and 18 April 1975, in the US and UK respectively, [...] "Stand by Me" [...] was released as a single, backed with [...] "Move Over Ms. L", a song that was meant to appear on Walls and Bridges but cut from the final line-up. Peaking at number 20 in the US and number 30 in the UK. Lennon promoted the song by appearing on the BBC TV show Old Grey Whistle Test, which also featured an interview by Bob Harris. The show had Lennon singing live over the backing tracks of [...] "Stand by Me" [...] and [...] "Slippin' and Slidin'". Lennon also appeared on Salute to Sir Lew – The Master Showman singing live again over backing tracks, this time for three songs: [...] "Stand by Me", [...] "Slippin' and Slidin'" [...] and [...] "Imagine". A second single, [...] "Slippin N Slidin"/"Ain't That a Shame" [...] (Apple 1883), was announced, promotional copies were pressed, but was never released. [...] "Ya Ya", backed with [...] "Be-Bop-A-Lula", was released as a single only in Germany, peaking at number 47 on the Media Control Charts. Lennon said the following about Rock 'n' Roll: [...] "It started in '73 with Phil and fell apart. I ended up as part of mad, drunk scenes in Los Angeles <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> finished it off on me own. And there was still problems with it up to the minute it came out.

In November, she confirmed via her official Facebook that she was writing the final lyrics for the record. In January 2014, Shakira spoke on the album's recording and production, saying that she was [...] "so happy" [...] to be sharing her album [...] "with you all", Shakira continued {{to speak about the}} album; saying it was something she had [...] "been working on for over two years now." [...] In the same interview Shakira elaborated saying [...] "The work on this album has spanned a very eventful time, with many ups and downs but ultimately, the happiest period in my life thus far, including the birth of my son. I've explored many different directions, worked with many different people, and written many, many demos before arriving at the finished product I will soon be presenting to you."

2500|$|... "Everyone Will Die" [...] ("a {{celebration of}} life, not {{necessarily}} a death song," [...] said Pierre) was first recorded as a scratch demo on the band's tour bus, and the original vocal track from that recording was kept for the album version, as it represented the emotion the band were striving for. A string section was employed for the bridge. [...] "Having real strings was like {{a dream come true}} for me. I've always wanted to arrange parts, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> got to," [...] said Taylor. [...] "The Coma Kid" [...] relates to procrastination: [...] "The Coma Kid...somebody who's unable to 'do.' Somebody who's thinking of 'doing,' but not actually 'doing.'" [...] The song was described as a throwback of sorts to [...] "Modern Chemistry", a track from the band's debut, I Am The Movie. [...] "Boxelder" [...] was written uniquely, in an attempt to break songwriting routine; as a result, the song switches between time signatures, going from seven to four-four during the chorus. [...] "A boxelder needs the tree to live, because they infest the trees, but for them to live they end up killing the tree, and [...] relates that to a relationship, which I think is very interesting," [...] said Johnson. [...] "The Worst Is Yet to Come" [...] dates as far back as 2009, and was recorded in the span of one day. Tony Thaxton was not involved in the initial writing due to an arm infection, which also was an issue in the recording process of My Dinosaur Life. Because of his absence, Claudio Rivera of Saves the Day stood in as the drummer for the original demo; Thaxton's drum part was developed later and is present on the album. Likewise, [...] "Bad Ideas" [...] is the oldest song on the album, first attempted during sessions for 2005's Commit This to Memory.|$|E
