5|$|A {{number of}} design faults of the Tetrarch were {{revealed}} through its operational use. Its size limited the possible crew to three, a {{driver in the}} hull and a gunner <b>and</b> <b>commander</b> in the turret, resulting in too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively. The gunner or commander, {{in addition to his}} own duties, had to act as loader for the 2 pounder, which caused delays in combat. A report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank, controlling a troop of Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible.|$|E

The French had previously implored Fakhri to persuade his father to surrender in return for his release, but Fakhri refused.|$|E
5|$|Ambassador Soval is summoned before Administrator V'Las and the High Council to face {{punishment}} {{over his}} use of a mind meld.

Soon, Archer begins to see visions of an old Vulcan, and the dissidents determine {{that he had the}} katra of Surak transferred into him via mind meld.|$|E
