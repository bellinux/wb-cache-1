5|$|In December 2015, Belgian {{entrepreneur}} Guido Dumarey commenced {{negotiations to}} buy the Commodore manufacturing plant in South Australia, {{with a view to}} continue producing a rebadged Zeta-based premium range of rear and <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> vehicles for local and export sales. The proposal was met with doubt in South Australia, and it later came to nothing. On 20 October 2017 it ceased manufacturing vehicles in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{introduced}} {{as a single}} sedan body style, the range expanded in 1979 to include a station wagon. From 1984, Holden began branding the flagship Commodore model as Holden Calais, with the Commodore Berlina introduced in 1984 gaining independent Holden Berlina nomenclature in 1988. Long-wheelbase Statesman/Caprice derivatives and Commodore utility body variants followed in 1990. The third generation architecture spawned the most body styles, with a new Holden utility launched in 2000 (now officially as the Holden Ute), reborn Monaro coupé in 2001, four-door Holden Crewman utility and <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> (AWD) Holden Adventra crossover in 2003. Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) in 1987 began official modification of high performance variants of the Commodore and its derivatives, under its own nameplate.|$|E
5|$|Lexus {{production}} models are named alphanumerically using two-letter designations followed by three digits. The first letter indicates relative {{status in the}} Lexus model range (ranking), and the second letter refers to car body style or type (e.g. LS for 'luxury sedan'). The three digits indicate engine displacement in liters multiplied {{by a factor of}} one hundred (e.g. 350 for a 3.5 L engine). A space is used between the letters and numbers. The same letter may be used differently depending on the model; 'S' can refer to 'sedan' or 'sport' (e.g. in LS and SC), while 'X' refers to 'luxury utility vehicle' or SUV. On hybrids, the three digits refer to the combined gasoline-electric output. For certain models, a lower case letter placed after the alphanumeric designation indicates powerplant type ('h' for hybrid, 'd' for diesel, 't' for turbocharged), while capital letter(s) placed at the end indicates a class subtype (e.g. 'L' for long-wheelbase, 'C' for coupe, 'AWD' for <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive).</b> On F marque models, the two-letter designation and the letter 'F' are used with no numbers or hyphens (e.g. IS F).|$|E
25|$|G37x Coupe uses an ATTESA E-TS <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system.|$|E
25|$|The Holden Adventra (VZ) is an <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> wagon {{update to}} the {{original}} VY II series model.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Audi {{introduced}} the first series production ESP for <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> vehicles (Audi A8 and Audi A6 with quattro (four-wheel drive system)).|$|E
25|$|Some {{particular}} contemporary {{developments are}} {{the proliferation of}} front- and <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> {{the adoption of the}} diesel engine, and the ubiquity of fuel injection. Most modern passenger cars are front-wheel-drive monocoque/unibody designs, with transversely mounted engines.|$|E
25|$|V8 models use {{recirculating}} ball steering (as per previous 5 Series generations), however {{rack and pinion}} steering was used for the first time, in the four-cylinder and six-cylinder models. Unlike its E34 predecessor and E60 successor, the E39 was not available with <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E
25|$|GM {{revealed}} an updated 2014 Regal at the 2013 New York Auto Show. Changes include a revised interior and exterior, {{a boost in}} performance for the CXL Turbo up to 258hp (192kW) and 295lb·ft (400 N·m) of torque, and an available <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> option offered for the 2.0L engine/6-speed automatic transmission equipped vehicles. Changes for the GS include revised interior and exterior, a drop in power to match that of the CXL Turbo, and available an <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> option offered for the 2.0L / six-speed automatic transmission equipped vehicles. The six-speed manual transmission is still offered, {{but only in the}} front-wheel drive variant. Buick's VentiPorts have reappeared starting with 2014 models, a styling feature unique to Buick dating back to 1949.|$|E
25|$|The 2.4L Ecotec four-cylinder {{replaced}} the 3.0 V6 {{as the standard}} engine on the CX model {{in the first quarter}} of 2010. The 3.6L V6 continues to be an option on the CX and front-wheel drive CXL and standard on the CXS and <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> CXL.|$|E
25|$|The Camry in Japan was {{released}} on 30 January 2006 with a sales target of 1,000 units per month. Two driveline combinations are offered—the 2.4-liter engine and five-speed automatic transmission in front-wheel drive (FWD) configuration—or the same engine paired with the four-speed automatic utilizing <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> (AWD).|$|E
25|$|The Avalanche was an <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> {{crossover}} SUV {{that was}} manufactured by Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) in 2005. Based on the Holden Adventra LX8 crossover wagon, the Avalanche range also incorporated a dual-cab utility model {{known as the}} HSV Avalanche XUV. The XUV derived from the Holden Crewman Cross8.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} related Holden VY <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> {{vehicles}}, the HSV Y Series AWD vehicles as built from September 2004 to March 2005 confusingly have Z Series compliance and Vehicle Identification Numbers; this correlates {{to the building}} of new specification Holden VZ and Z Series HSV non-AWD cars during this period.|$|E
25|$|Mechanically, the 2005 {{model was}} also changed. A major change {{included}} a drive-by-wire throttle for all CR-Vs. The <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system was improved; {{it had been}} tuned to activate faster in low traction situations. US market models were equipped with a five-speed automatic, {{as opposed to the}} previous four-speed automatic.|$|E
25|$|The Legacy still uniquely offers {{standard}} <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> and horizontally opposed engine layouts, but discontinues {{the manual}} transmission for the US market {{in favor of}} the Lineartronic CVT on both engine configurations. The US Market variation of the 2016 Legacy achieves a notable 36 highway MPG when equipped with the 2.5-liter flat-four.|$|E
25|$|In a {{test drive}} of the LP550-2 Valentino Balboni, the test driver bearing {{the name of}} the car said he was against E-gear because it takes some amount of vehicle control away from the driver, and <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> Lamborghinis from the beginning, and the company was divided over AWD cars. In that review, a LP550-2 with E-Gear was tested.|$|E
25|$|Sporting the {{ubiquitous}} VQ35DE engine, the Infiniti G35 uses a front-midship engine, rear-wheel drive layout (<b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> {{is available for}} the G35x sedan) to achieve a 52% front/48% rear weight distribution. Both body styles are available with either a 5-speed automatic or 6-speed manual transmission, although the automatic is the only transmission available for the AWD sedan.|$|E
25|$|The Cultus GTi was {{now much}} more powerful, {{reaching}} 115PS JIS (85kW) with {{updated version of}} the previous GTi engine: the G13B engine that had higher compression pistons (11.5:1 compression ratio), tubular exhaust headers, a tubular intake manifold, larger camshafts and a reprogrammed ECU. Some models of the Cultus GTi were also available with <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Eagle {{name came}} from the {{innovative}} <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> AMC Eagle line, but the Medallion was a standard passenger car and its sales were also hindered by marketing missteps. There was no specific advertising campaign highlighting the Medallion sedans and wagons. Chrysler also planned to phase out the Medallion sedan {{in favor of a}} four-wheel-drive wagon by 1990.|$|E
25|$|On April 8, 2015, Tesla {{introduced}} the Model S 70D as its new entry-level car, with <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> and an improved range of }; an 5kWhe could be purchased with a software unlock. The 70D replaced the 60 and 60D in the Model S lineup, {{with the latter}} two models no longer being available for purchase. The P85 option was also dropped.|$|E
25|$|Intended to be {{the high}} {{performance}} version of the model range, all R models are fitted {{with the highest performance}} engines of the line up. Available in both front-wheel drive and <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> with either automatic or manual transmission. A redesigned suspension with lower ride height and firmer shocks was standard. Three different versions were produced, depending on the model year.|$|E
25|$|The new Hornet {{became an}} {{important}} vehicle and platform for AMC. It served the company {{in one form or}} another for eighteen years, until the 1988 model year. It would outlast all other compact platforms from the competition that included the Chevrolet Nova, Ford Maverick, and Plymouth Valiant. The Hornet was also the basis for AMC's Gremlin, Concord, Spirit, and the innovative <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> AMC Eagle.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} Cruze had standard front-wheel drive, with <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> optional. Chevrolet {{pursued a}} marketing strategy that positioned the high-riding Cruze as a light-duty {{sport utility vehicle}} (SUV). This contrasted with Suzuki's approach with the Ignis marketed as a conventional passenger model. From 2003, Suzuki of Europe began manufacturing the Cruze as the Suzuki Ignis—representing a facelift of the original Ignis, but only for European markets.|$|E
25|$|These streams have nurtured microclimates {{that allow}} for the {{development}} of ecological niches, with many endemic species (species that do not live anywhere else on the planet), worthy of study and observation. In general access to them is difficult due to the rugged terrain, often inaccessible to any vehicle (including those with <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive)</b> and thus can only be reached on foot, by mule or by horseback.|$|E
25|$|<b>All-wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> last {{available}} in the E30 3 Series, was reintroduced for the E46. It was available for the 325xi, 330xi and 330xd sedan/wagon models. The E46 was the first 3 Series to be available with an engine using variable valve lift ("valvetronic"). Various electronic features were also introduced to the 3 Series in the E46 generation, including satellite navigation, electronic brake-force distribution, rain-sensing wipers and LED tail-lights.|$|E
25|$|Priced {{lower than}} the G37, the G25 was aimed to compete with {{entry-level}} luxury rivals such as the Lexus IS250, Audi A4 and BMW 328i. Compared to the G37, other than a smaller engine and fewer options (no six-speed manual transmission available, no Navigation, no Premium or Technology packages in the U.S. market), the G25 was otherwise identical and features a choice of rear-wheel drive or ATTESA <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E
25|$|US models {{went on sale}} as 2014 {{model year}} {{vehicles}} on June 28, 2013. Early models include IS 250 RWD, IS 250 AWD, IS 350 RWD, IS 350 AWD. In 2015, for the 2016 model year, the IS 250 was discontinued and replaced by the rear wheel drive only IS 200t. The IS 300 is only offered with <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> while {{the top of the}} line IS 350 can be ordered with either drivetrain.|$|E
25|$|The first {{generation}} (1996–2000) debuted in November 1996 as the estate {{variant of the}} Volvo S70. Both cars were essentially redesigned Volvo 850s which had itself been available in saloon and estate configurations. The V70 was available as a front and <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> estate, the latter marketed as the V70 AWD. In 1997, a special AWD version called V70 Cross Country, badged as V70 XC, was presented and went on sale for model year 1998.|$|E
25|$|Completely new {{optional}} {{feature is the}} new Land Rover Active Driveline on demand four-wheel drive system, which is manufactured by GKN Driveline. The Active Driveline system works by disconnecting {{all of the major}} all wheel drive components from the gearbox, rather than at the central coupling. The system also features torque vectoring to direct power to individual wheels. GKN Driveline also supplies the <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system for the Standard Driveline thus replacing the Haldex system.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Volvo {{introduced}} the Blind Spot Information System (BLIS), which detects vehicles entering the vehicle's blind spot with a side-view-mirror-mounted camera, and alerts the driver with a light. That year also saw Volvos sold in all markets equipped with side-marker lights and daytime running lights. Also, since 2004 all Volvo models {{except for the}} coupes (C70 and C30) are available with an <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system developed by Haldex Traction of Sweden.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the RC was {{available}} {{with a choice}} of three engines; the RC 300h with the 2.5-liter 2AR-FSE inline-four engine mated to a continuously variable transmission, the RC 350 with the 3.5-liter 2GR-FSE V6, and the RC F with 5.0-liter 2UR-GSE V8.

25|$|The Holden Commodore (VZ) is an {{executive}} {{car that was}} produced by the Australian manufacturer Holden from 2004 to 2006 as a sedan, and to 2007 as a wagon and Ute sold alongside the new VE series. It was the fourth and final iteration of the third generation of this Australian made model and the last to spawn coupé and <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> variants. Its range continued to include the luxury variants, Holden Berlina (VZ) and Holden Calais (VZ).|$|E
25|$|Drift {{cars are}} usually light-to-moderate weight rear-wheel-drive coupes and sedans, {{offering}} a large {{range of power}} levels. There have also been <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> cars (AWD) that have been converted to rear-wheel drive such as Subaru WRX, Toyota Avensis as Scion tC, Mitsubishi EVO and Nissan GT-R. Early on AWD cars without conversion were allowed in some drifting competitions, usually the rules allowed only {{a certain percentage of}} power to be sent to the front wheels, but are banned in most (if not all) drifting competitions today.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} V70 {{was available}} {{with a wide}} variety of engines, gearboxes and equipment. Standard configuration was front-wheel drive, an <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> version badged as V70 AWD was available. For some markets Volvo offered a diesel version badged as V70 TDI. In countries with high taxes on cars with more than 2.0L engine capacity, such as Italy, special petrol models with a 2000cc engine capacity were offered. This included a 2.0T and a 2.0L T5 version, the latter with a slightly lower power output than the 2.3L variant.|$|E
25|$|The G35 sedan {{underwent}} a major revision for the 2007 model year. This 2nd generation front-mid (FM) platform underpinning the new G is shared {{in part with}} the Infiniti M and has several structural reinforcements around the engine and rear floor area, along with three times more laser welding and 16 percent more spot welds than the old version; overall body stiffness was improved by 40 percent. Single-pivot lower control arms in front replace the 1st gen model's twin lower links. The G35x sedan uses an ATTESA E-TS <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system.|$|E
25|$|The V70 XC, also {{referred}} to as V70 AWD Cross Country, was introduced in September 1997 on the Frankfurt Auto Show for the 1998 model year as a crossover version of the V70. It featured standard <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> and was available with only two engine and gearbox choices. In the US only the 2.4L turbo engine together with an automatic gearbox was available. A 2.0L version of the V70 XC was available only for markets with high taxes on cars with more than 2000cc engine capacity. Standard ride height was increased by 2.6cm over the regular AWD model.|$|E
