The GA-terminal, located {{on the west side of}} the airport, services cargo airlines, executive jets and <b>ambulance</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The airport is heated using district heating with a geothermal source. The airport uses 32.6GWh/year for heating and 5.6GWh/year for cooling. In addition, the airport uses 110GWh/year of electricity.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II, all pilots were conscripted into the military {{and there was a}} ban on civilian aviation. In 1940, the company started air ambulance flights for the military. Following the German invasion of Norway, many of Widerøe's pilots and aircraft were flown to Mjøsa where they served as part of the defence. All civilian aircraft were grounded during the occupation, and German authorities demanded that magnetos and propellers be handed in. The workshop at Bogstad was kept busy with production of ambulance sleds for the German military. In secret, the company also started building the Hønningstad C-5 Polar <b>ambulance</b> <b>aircraft</b> at Bogstad.|$|E
25|$|Loganair had one {{previous}} {{air ambulance}} accident, also involving a Britten Norman Islander, on 19 May 1996, {{in which the}} pilot was killed, and the two passengers, a physician and a flight nurse, were injured. (In 1996, flights were typically made with a nurse, and sometimes a physician, if needed. The passenger cabin of the Islander was of limited size, and typical of <b>ambulance</b> <b>aircraft,</b> working conditions could be quite cramped with more personnel.) This 1996 accident bore similarities to the 2005 accident. It occurred at night with a single fatigued and poorly rested pilot making an approach in difficult weather, though {{in this case it}} was a strong and gusting crosswind rather than poor visibility that was the primary meteorological challenge.|$|E
500|$|Fornebu had two runways: a main [...] east–west {{runway and}} a {{secondary}} [...] north–south. Only the main runway was used under ordinary weather conditions, with the north–south runway only being used {{if there was}} strong winds {{from the north and}} for general aviation, helicopters and <b>ambulance</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The main runway was equipped with instrument landing system category 1. Under ordinary weather conditions, flights to Fornebu were to, as soon as possible, divert southwards along the Oslo Fjord to avoid noise pollution to residential areas. However, when necessary, a direct approach could be made eastwards from Drammen or westwards from Grefsenåsen. Until 1996, Oslo Air Traffic Control Center (Oslo ATCC) was located at Fornebu. It had the responsibility to oversee all air traffic in southeastern Norway, bordering to Dovre in the north, almost to Stavanger in the west, halfway to Stockholm to the east and almost to Denmark in the south.|$|E

50|$|A licence {{was sold}} to Yugoslavia in 1938 and made four RWD-13, and two RWD-13s were {{produced}} 1939 there by Rogožarski. All four RWD-13s were converted in 1939 into <b>ambulance</b> RWD-13S <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Air Traffic Control (ATC) grants special {{treatment}} to air ambulance operations, {{much like a}} ground ambulance using lights and a siren, only when they are actively operating with a patient. [...] When this happens, air <b>ambulance</b> <b>aircraft</b> take the call sign MEDEVAC (formerly LIFEGUARD) and receive priority handling {{in the air and}} on the ground.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{prototype}} {{made its}} maiden flight in mid-1935, soon being {{followed by a}} second aircraft, similar to the first. [...] A third prototype, with a deeper fuselage allowing an additional passenger to be carried, more powerful engines and a revised undercarriage, {{formed the basis for}} the planned Ao 192B civil transport, with versions planned to serve as light transports, <b>ambulance</b> <b>aircraft</b> and survey aircraft. [...] In addition, a number of military variants were proposed, including a light reconnaissance aircraft and a light bomber.|$|E
2500|$|The first Harrow was {{delivered}} to No. 214 Squadron RAF on 13 January 1937, with all 100 delivered {{by the end of}} the year, with five bomber squadrons of the RAF being equipped with the Harrow. The Fleet Air Arm ordered 100 Harrows but Handley Page lacked the production capacity to supply them. Despite being fitted with cabin heating by steam boilers using exhaust heat, the Harrow gained a reputation of being a cold and draughty aircraft, owing to the turret design. As the delivery of more modern bombers increased, the Harrow was phased out as a frontline bomber by the end of 1939 but continued to be used as a transport. 271 Squadron was formed on 1 May 1940 with a mixture of Harrows, Bristol Bombays and impressed civil aircraft. While the other aircraft equipping 271 Squadron were replaced by Douglas Dakotas, it retained a flight of Harrows (sometimes nicknamed [...] "Sparrows" [...] due to their new nose fairings to give a more streamlined fuselage) as transports and <b>ambulance</b> <b>aircraft</b> until the end of the Second World War in Europe.|$|E

50|$|Guelph Airpark is a {{transfer}} {{point for the}} Province of Ontario's air ambulance service - ORNGE. ORNGE helicopters land on the ramp near the terminal building and transfer patients to and from land <b>ambulances.</b> Antique <b>aircraft</b> often use the grass between runway 05/23 and the east-west taxiway for landings and takeoffs. Occasionally gliders on cross-country flights land at Guelph if they run out of lift.|$|R

50|$|Medical evacuation, often {{shortened}} to medevac or medivac, is the {{timely and}} efficient movement and en route care provided by medical personnel to wounded being evacuated from a battlefield, to injured patients being evacuated {{from the scene}} of an accident to receiving medical facilities, or to patients at a rural hospital requiring urgent care at a better-equipped facility using medically equipped ground vehicles (<b>ambulances)</b> or <b>aircraft</b> (air <b>ambulances).</b>|$|R
25|$|Critical care {{transporters}} move patients by ground <b>ambulance</b> or <b>aircraft</b> between {{medical treatment}} facilies. This may {{be done to}} allow a patient to receive {{a higher level of}} care in a more specialized facility. Registered Nurses with training in Emergency Nursing may work with paramedics in these settings. Paramedics participating in this role generally also provide care not traditionally administered by Paramedics who respond to 911 calls. Examples of this are blood transfusions, intra-aortic balloon pumps, and mechanical ventilators.|$|R
50|$|Arab Wings was {{established}} in 1975 as the first private jet charter operator in the Middle East.
