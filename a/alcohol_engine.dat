The test engine has previously been optimized to run on ethanol with Beraid (Trade mark of the ignition improver manufactured by the Akzo Nobel Surface Chemistry AB). Hence, the engine design, engine performance, and other functional parameters, which affect the engine thermodynamics and its thermochemistry, have been optimized. To investigate the effects of the different PEG-s on emission levels and engine performance, the fuel injection, particularly injection timing, was optimized for running the engine on ethanol and New PEG (5 %), which has replaced the previously developed PEG dissolved with 7 % concentration in ethanol. Based on a computerized analysis of measured high frequency signals as cylinder pressure, fuel line pressure, and needle lift related to the crank angles, the injection timing of 12 deg before TDC was found as the optimized value, (see our previous report No 98 / 9 " Reference Test with Poly-Ethylene-Glycol (PEG) Ignition Improver").

40|$|The paper {{depicts the}} main topics of the {{experimental}} investigation on <b>alcohol</b> <b>engine</b> development field, aiming at the engineering targets for the emission levels. The {{first part of this}} study was focused on engine design optimization for running on ethanol mexed with poly-ethylene glycol (PEG) as ignition improver. It was shown that some design changes in compression ratio, turbine casing, injector nozzle configuration and exhaust pressure governor (EPG) activation, lead to a better engine thermodynamics and thermochemistry. The second objective of this study was the investigation of engine performance and enmission levels, when the ignition improver diethyl ether (DEE) would be generated on board via catalyticallly dehydration of ethanol, and used directly as soluble mixture or separately fumigated. Both alternatives: ether fumigation technique and dissolved ether in alcohol fuel application were conceptually analyzed, and a stand up system based on DEE fumigation was used to determine the optimum DEE-ethanol ratio at any engine operating range. The heat release investigation, when the engine was run on neat ethanol and optimum fumigated DEE, has been indicated earlier combustion, and very short ignition delay. Verified possibilities for using DEE as ignition improver, would lead to a proper version of the on board ether reactor design, which would bring to another solution for ethanol fuelled engines...|$|E
40|$|The {{ignition}} improvers {{available on}} the market are rather expensive, toxic and, as expected, highly explosive. They are normally used in two different ways: mixed directly into the base fuel leading to a soluble fuel or fed separately into the engine. A suitable emulsifying agent is often required when the soluble fuel is considered. Considering the latter possibility, the two fuel system is more complex and costly, and therefore not so commonly used. In order to use the ignition improvers sufficiently they have to meet some requirements, especially {{with regards to the}} minimum admixture quantity, sufficient solubility and storability in alcohol, lubricating properties, minimum toxicity etc. Dissolved ignition improvers as “Beraid” or “Avocet” have been successfully used in Volvo and Scania diesel engines. Different investigations and engine design optimizations for running on ethanol with beraid. as ignition improver have been done at the Department of Thermo and Fluid Dynamics (CTH) through different projects and studies. The results of these studies are reported in different publications of the Swedish Transport & Communications Research Board (KFB) and CTH- TFD internai papers. This possibility to use ethers, such as Dimethyl Ether (DME) and Diethyl Ether (DEE), when running the engine on methanol and ethanol respectively, was studied and followed up with an experimental project in a modified <b>alcohol</b> <b>engine</b> Volvo AH 10 A 245. The aim of the project was to verify the possibility to use ethers, from an economical point of view, instead of ignition improvers.

Experimental testing has produced promising results. However, the complexity of today’s engines makes simulation models indispensable. Existing models are generally only valid for gasoline operation. The aim {{of this research was}} therefore to formulate a model for engines running on methanol and ethanol. The study mainly focused on characterizing the effects of turbulence and chemistry on the in-cylinder combustion of these fuels. Reliable data for the burning velocity in the presence and absence of turbulence was obtained using chemical kinetics’ calculations in addition to experimental measurements on two different setups: a flat flame burner at Lund University (Sweden) and a fan-stirred combustion vessel at Leeds University (UK). One of the main advantages of light alcohols compared to gasoline is their elevated resistance to engine knock. To enable computational quantification of this advantage, a knock prediction model was built for these fuels based on chemical kinetics’ calculations of their autoignition delay time. A final step consisted of implementing the submodels for normal, turbulent combustion and abnormal, knocking combustion in an engine simulation code. This code was successfully validated against experimental results obtained on different flex-fuel and dedicated <b>alcohol</b> <b>engines...</b>|$|R

The development of alcohol-fuelled engines has been mainly experimental up till now. The application of an engine cycle code valid for these fuels could help to unlock their full potential. For this reason, our research group decided to extend its in-house <b>engine</b> code to <b>alcohols.</b> This paper discusses the requirements {{for the construction of}} a two-zone thermodynamic model that can predict the power cycle, pollutant emissions and knock onset in <b>alcohol</b> <b>engines.</b> We reviewed the properties of alcohol fuels and their use in dedicated engine technology. From this information we identified the characteristics relevant to combustion engines and defined the areas the model should cover in terms of cylinder pressure, temperature, residual gas fraction, etc. Next, we investigated which building blocks of the current model will need adaptations. For the laminar burning velocity of alcohol-air mixtures, our literature review revealed a lack of data at engine-like conditions. Upon inspection of the pollutant formation models, we found that special attention should be paid to the formation of aldehydes and selected a suitable formation model. Finally we decided that a knock prediction model based on a one-step Arrhenius-type autoignition reaction is best suited for our purpose. Future work will further focus on each of these building blocks separately in order to come to a comprehensive model for the combustion of <b>alcohols</b> in spark-ignition <b>engines...</b>|$|R

Neat <b>alcohol</b> <b>engines</b> become difficult, if not impossible, to start at temperatures close to or below freezing. Improvements in the cold-start performance (both time to start and emissions) are essential to capture the full benefits of alcohols as an alternative transportation fuel.

The project emphasis was on fuel-grade ethanol (E 95) but the technology can be easily extended to other alcohol fuels. Ultimately a compact, on-vehicle, ethanol POX reactor was developed as a fuel system component to produce a hydrogen-rich, fuel-gas mixture for cold starts. The POX reactor is an easily controllable combustion device that allows flexibility during engine startup even in the most extreme conditions. It is a small device that is mounted directly onto the engine intake manifold. The gaseous fuel products (or reformate) from the POX reactor exit the chamber and enter the intake manifold, either replacing or supplementing the standard ethanol fuel consumed during an engine start.

Results are given for a test matrix made up of twelve steady-state operating conditions. For all conditions except the 1 / 4 rack (light load) condition, modest thermal efficiency gains were noted upon ethanol fumigation. Methanol showed the same increase at 3 / 4 and full rack (high load) conditions. However, engine roughness or the occurrence of severe knock limited the maximum amount of alcohol that could be fumigated. Brake specific nitrogen oxide concentrations were found to decrease for all ethanol conditions tested. Oxides of nitrogen emissions, on a volume basis, decreased for all alcohol conditions tested. Based on the limited particulate data analyzed, it appears that ethanol fumigation, like methanol fumigation, while lowering the mass of particulated emitted, does enhance the biological activity of that particulate...|$|R
